    "with increasing of the collision energy in @xmath0 heavy - ion experiments the role of the multiparticle production and the collective effects of particle interaction becomes more significant .",
    "large progress has been achieved in study of the considered processes within perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "perturbative theory is not able to reproduce all consequences inherent to corresponding lagrangian of the interaction , in particular , the collective aspects of the behaviour of considered systems as a whole can have fundamental significance for description of the features of the confinement and hadronization . here",
    "methods of the statistical physics are fruitful since a mathematical apparatus used at investigation of the multiplicity distribution and particle correlations is common both for the statistical physics and for the processes of the multiparticle production @xcite .",
    "investigations of the collective excited modes of the hadron ( quark - gluon ) medium began to carry out not long ago and have a phenomenological character .    for statistical systems",
    "the fluctuations are large near critical points",
    ". therefore the multiplicity fluctuations of hadrons produced in high - energy heavy - ion collisions can be used as a measure of whether a quark - gluon system has undergone a phase transition @xcite . until today",
    "the question concerning order of the parton - hadron pt in high - energy collisions is opened .",
    "lattice gauge calculations indicate that for two flavors the pt is most likely of the second order @xcite .",
    "when strange quarks are included , it may become a weak first - order pt @xcite .    at present accelerator energies",
    "the average number of produced particles is large enough and therefore the scattering operator and other operators are inconvenient to consider in terms of number states . at the same time in such systems as lasers where the average number of photons is large",
    "it is conveniently to use the coherent state representation ( p - representation ) @xcite .",
    "there are a number of efforts to apply p - representation for investigation of the multiplicity fluctuations as a phenomenological manifestation of quark - hadron pt in the framework of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) formalism both for the second - order @xcite and first - order @xcite pt . in both cases",
    "it was supposed that multiplicity distribution of the hadrons without pt is a poissonian and scaling behaviour of the factorial moments has been found .",
    "moreover the scaling exponent @xmath1 is equal 1.305 for second - order pt @xcite and @xmath2 for the generalized gl model with first - order pt @xcite .",
    "there was the disagreement between experiment and theory .",
    "indeed , na22 data on particle production in hadronic collisions give @xmath3 @xcite , heavy - ion experiments @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite .    at the same time",
    "the study of multiplicity fluctuations in a similar type of phase transition have carried out in nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "it was shown that second - order pt is related to the symmetry - changing instability of stationary non - equilibrium states .",
    "this fact may be additional evidence for the use of optical methods at investigation problems of the pt in the multiparticle production processes .",
    "indeed , the idea of applying stochastic methods developed for studying photon - counting statistics of light beams to particle production processes was used for explanation of the experimentally observed properties hadrons , in particular , the multiplicity distributions , factorial and cumulant moments .",
    "it was shown that the most general distribution that characterizes @xmath6 neutrino - induced collisions is a @xmath7-mode squeezed state distribution @xcite .",
    "squeezed states ( ss ) involve coherent states as the specific case and posses uncommon properties : they display a specific behaviour of the factorial and cumulant moments @xcite and can have both sub - poissonian and super - poissonian statistics corresponding to antibunching and bunching of photons @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although the ss are constructed in quantum optics ( qo ) their relevance to hadron production in high - energy collisions was recognized long ago @xcite . in particular , the multiplicity distribution of the pions has been explained by formalism of the squeezed isospin states @xcite . in addition , study of the evolution of gluon states at the non - perturbative stage of jet development has obtained the new squeezed gluon states @xcite-@xcite which could be necessary element of hadronization and , in particular , qgp@xmath8hadrons .",
    "then using the local parton hadron duality it is easy to show that in this case behaviour of hadron multiplicity distribution in jet events is differentiated from the negative binomial one .",
    "such specific behaviour of the multiplicity distribution is confirmed by experiments for @xmath9-collisions  @xcite-@xcite .    considering multiplicity distribution in different collisions without pt",
    "as squeezed one we generalize the coherent state representation taking into account the squeezed states within gl - approach for investigation of the multiplicity fluctuations at phase transition in qgp . since the multiplicity fluctuations exhibit intermittency behaviour which is observed in a large number of experiments , we investigate conditions of appearance of this effect in depending on the parameters of gl model .",
    "it is convenient to start description of the squeezed - state formalism in gl theory with definition of the photon ss",
    ". two basic kinds of single - mode ideal ss are used in qo : coherent squeezed state ( css ) and scaling ss ( sss ) @xcite defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a displacement operator , @xmath12 is a squeeze operator , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are an amplitude and a phase of the coherent state correspondingly , @xmath16 is an arbitrary complex number , @xmath17 is a squeeze factor , phase @xmath18 defines the direction of squeezing maximum @xcite . using general formula for two - photon coherent state distribution @xcite we can write the corresponding expression for css and sss distributions in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a hermite polynomials , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are equal in case of css @xmath23,\\\\ \\\\[0.2 cm ] \\xi_2= \\bigl[\\langle n\\rangle - \\sinh^2(r)\\bigr ] % \\\\\\vspace{-0.3cm}\\\\ \\quad{}\\times \\bigl \\{\\cosh(2r ) [ \\tanh(r ) \\cos(2\\gamma - \\theta ) - 1 ] % \\\\\\vspace{-0.3cm}\\\\",

    "taking into account the explicit form of the probability density of finding @xmath31 particles in ss @xmath33 ( [ dens_distr_ss ] ) we obtain the next expression for the hadron multiplicity distribution @xmath51+\\int\\limits_v|\\psi(z)|^2 dz\\ : f_2(r,\\gamma ,    \\theta)\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\{}&&\\times      \\left|h_n\\left(\\left[\\int\\limits_v|\\psi(z)|^2 dz\\right]^{\\frac12 } f_1(r,\\gamma , \\theta)\\right )      \\right|^2\\!\\!\\!.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to investigate obtained expression we identify @xmath52 and regard that @xmath53 is constant in every bin width @xmath54 ( @xmath55 is a dimension ) . then multiplicity distribution after phase transition is @xmath56\\sqrt{\\frac{\\delta^d}{2b}}\\biggr ) ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a function of the parabolic cylinder .",

    "one of the effective way to manifest the nature of the multiplicity fluctuations in high - energy collisions is to examine the dependence of the normalized factorial moments @xmath59 @xcite @xmath60 on the bin width @xmath54 in rapidity . here",
