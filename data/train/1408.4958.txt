    "the problem of scattering by a radiation field on test particle motion was first investigated long ago by poynting @xcite in the context of newtonian gravity , and then generalized to the case of a weak gravitational field by robertson @xcite .",
    "the particles interact with the radiation field of an emitting source by adsorbing and re - emitting radiation , causing a drag force responsible for deviation from geodesic motion , known as poynting - robertson effect .",
    "recently the generalization to the framework of general relativity has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where this effect on test particles orbiting in the equatorial plane of a schwarzschild or kerr spacetime has been considered .",
    "the radiation field is taken there as a test field superposed to the gravitational background . in ref .",
    "@xcite a self - consistent radiation flux was instead used to investigate such a kind of interaction in the exact , vaidya spherically symmetric spacetime whose source is a null dust @xcite .",
    "particles undergo in this case the action of a thomson - type interaction with the radiation in terms of which the energy - momentum tensor is interpreted . the way adopted to model this interaction simply consists in taking the 4-momentum density of radiation observed in the particle s rest frame and fix , by an effective proportionality constant , what part of it is being transferred to the particle .",
    "in the present paper we follow the same approach to study the interaction of test particles with an electromagnetic radiation field .",
    "suppose that before the passage of the wave the spacetime is flat .",
    "an electromagnetic wave propagating over a spacetime region makes it not empty and not flat .",
    "therefore , the spacetime curvature associated with an electromagnetic pulse , namely the associated gravitational field , induces observable effects on test particle motion . while it seems that the relativistic community is quite familiar with the effects related to the passage of a gravitational wave it is somehow surprising that its electromagnetic counterpart is rather poorly studied .",
    "it is expected that a test particle as well as a test field can be scattered by the wave and hence it will modify its own energy and momentum as a consequence of this interaction .",
    "an exact solution of einstein s field equations representing the gravitational field associated with an electromagnetic radiation field was discovered long ago by griffiths @xcite .",
    "he then studied the strong field interaction between exact gravitational and electromagnetric waves @xcite .",
    "this work has been further generalized in refs .",
    "@xcite , where colliding wave packets consisting of hybrid mixtures of electromagnetic , gravitational and scalar waves in a strong field regime were considered . we will study first the geodesics of such a solution , which can be determined fully analytically , so that the first approximation approach to the scattering problem can be given a complete answer .",
    "we will then investigate the interaction with the radiation field filling the spacetime region by considering accelerated orbits with acceleration proportional to the energy - momentum distribution of the wave . in a sense , in the scattering process the particle absorbs and re - emits radiation , resulting in a force term acting on the particle itself .",
    "the equations of motion can be analytically solved also in this case .",
    "we may consider this as a second approximation approach to the scattering problem .",
    "finally , we will study also fields besides particles as scattered by the electromagnetic wave , namely scalar ( spin 0 ) , massless spin @xmath0 and electromagnetic ( spin 1 ) fields , and discuss the features of the scattering as well as the coupling between quantum numbers and background parameters .",

    "the effects of the interaction can thus be summarized by a rotation ( due to the antisymmetric matrix @xmath143 ) plus a deformation ( due to the symmetric matrix @xmath144 ) of the initial electric field .",
    "_ only _ the rotation matrix depends on the frequency @xmath145 of the incoming field and can be associated with a rotation vector in a standard way , i.e. , @xmath146 ( @xmath147 being the levi - civita indicator of the three dimensional euclidean space ) .",
    "therefore , the electric field ( [ ehexp ] ) can be rewritten in the form ^0+^2 ( t - z)^2 ( s e^0 + a ^0 ) , where = 16 ( t - z)e_x -14 e_y , s e^0= (    c -14 e_z^0 + 12 e_y^0 + e_z^0 +    ) , which shows the coupling between the two frequencies @xmath145 and @xmath139 only in the rotational part of the total effect of the interaction and can be in principle measurable . finally , introducing magnitude and direction for @xmath148 , i.e. ,",
    "@xmath149 , with |a|=14 , we have ^0 + ^2 ( t - z)^2 s e^0 , = ^2 ( t - z)^2 |a| , implying that @xmath150 is obtained from @xmath151 by a rotation of an angle @xmath152 around the axis @xmath153 , plus a deformation effect .",
    "we have studied the interaction of test particles and fields of different spin with the radiation field of an electromagnetic plane wave .",
    "first of all we have integrated the geodesic equations to investigate the motion of test particles .",
    "then we have considered a more sophisticated interaction with the radiation field leading to accelerated orbits .",
    "the force term entering the equations of motion is taken to be proportional to the 4-momentum density of radiation observed in the particle s rest frame by the effective interaction cross section ( assumed to be a constant ) modeling the absorption and consequent re - emission of radiation by the particle .",
    "such an approach has been widely used in the recent literature to study the problem of scattering of test particles undergoing the action of a thomson - type interaction with a radiation field in different backgrounds of astrophysical interest leading to the well known poynting - robertson effect .",
    "we have then analyzed the deviations from geodesic motion due to such poynting - robertson - like  effect , taking advantage from the explicit analytic solutions we have been able to produce .",
    "finally we have studied the scattering of fields by the electromagnetic wave , i.e. , scalar ( spin 0 ) , massless spin @xmath0 and electromagnetic ( spin 1 ) , elucidating the different kind of interactions .",
    "the scattering of electromagnetic radiation has been also analysed in terms of the dielectric medium analogy  of a gravitational field .",
    "according to this framework , the electromagnetic field equations can be cast into the form of maxwell s equations in flat spacetime but in a medium  with prescribed dielectric and permeability tensors .",
    "this method allows to treat electromagnetic phenomena in curved spacetime by using techniques which are familiar from the flat spacetime theory . as an example we have considered the case of a superposed monocromatic electromagnetic wave to the background field corresponding in the flat spacetime limit to a circularly polarized wave propagating along the @xmath9 direction . as a result of the interaction the incoming wave",
    "is changed to a more complex field propagating along a different direction , the electric field undergoing a rotation plus a deformation effect .",
    "we have found that the coupling between the two frequencies @xmath145 and @xmath139 of the superposed and background electromagnetic wave is responsible for the rotational effect of the interaction and can be in principle measurable ."
