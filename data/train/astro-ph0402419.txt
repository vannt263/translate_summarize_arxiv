    "problems involving radiative transfer in refractive media appear to have received limited attention @xcite . in stellar atmospheres in particular ,",
    "refraction is always ignored since the gas is so tenuous that the index of refraction does not depart from unity .",
    "a notable exception is found in the atmospheres of very cool white dwarfs , especially those rich in helium , where the gas ( or rather the fluid ) density can reach @xmath1g/@xmath2 . under these conditions , the refractive index of fluid",
    ", atomic helium can become as large as @xmath3 with very large gradients ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) and refraction can be expected to affect the radiation field . in this contribution , we study radiative transfer in a stellar atmosphere with refraction . while we are motivated primarily by astrophysical applications ,",
    "the method developed here is general and can be directly applied to other problems with plane parallel geometry with an arbitrary , monotonic variation of the index of refraction .",
    "we consider refraction in a stellar atmosphere that is static , plane parallel , in local thermal equilibrium , in hydrostatic equilibrium , with both radiative and convective energy transport .",
    "the total flux is constant throughout the atmosphere and scattering is assumed isotropic .",
    "we further assume that the refraction of ray paths follows snell s law ( i.e. geometric optics ) as is appropriate in white dwarf atmospheres . for a given run of the index of refraction through the atmosphere ,",
    "this completely defines the trajectories of the ray paths and allows the derivation of a simple form of the equation of radiative transfer ( ert ) in the presence of dispersive effects .",
    "there is a number of interesting physical effects that we can expect in a stellar atmosphere where the index of refraction is greater than unity .",
    "the index @xmath4 is a monotonically increasing function of density . in a stellar atmosphere ,",
    "the index decreases from the bottom toward the surface where @xmath5 at @xmath6 .",
    "all rays are refracted away from the upward vertical and some rays are internally reflected back toward the interior ( fig .",
    "intuitively , this should lead to an increase in the temperature profile of the atmosphere to achieve flux conservation . because the largest variations of the index occur in the optically thin regions of the atmosphere ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) we expect refraction to be mainly a surface effect . furthermore , the group velocity of light is reduced by a factor of @xmath4 so light accelerates toward the surface where it reaches the speed of light in a vacuum .",
    "this directly affects the flux through its dependence on the velocity of propagation .",
    "the angular redistribution of light due to refraction will reduce the limb darkening effect . finally , the index of refraction of fluid helium is nearly independent of frequency from the optical to the near infrared and there should not be any significant chromatic effects .",
    "we follow the treatment of the theory of radiative transfer in dispersive media presented by cox & giuli ( 1968 ) .",
    "we develop two different numerical schemes to solve the ert in the presence of refraction based on the feautrier and @xmath7-iteration methods .",
    "both methods are widely used in stellar atmosphere codes and the procedures we have developed allows for a straightfroward implementation of the effects of refraction . to illustrate the effects of refraction in a stellar atmosphere , we apply both methods to solve for the radiation field in a realistic helium - rich white dwarf atmosphere model with @xmath8k , a gravity of @xmath9 and a homogeneous composition of @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number density of element x. this atmospheric structure , obtained with our white dwarf atmosphere code ( bergeron , saumon & wesemael 1995 ) , is hereafter referred to as the  nominal \" model .    in the next section , we construct the ert for a refractive , planar atmosphere , and new expressions for the moments of the radiation field are given in section 3 . the numerical solution with modified feautrier and @xmath7-iteration methods",

    "despite the significant change in the specific intensity shown in fig .",

    "the effects of refraction become much larger in models with lower effective temperatures or higher gravities and generally decreases as the hydrogen abundance increases . a detailed study of refractive effects in very cool white dwarfs atmospheres and spectra will be the subject of a subsequent publication .",

    "the resulting methods are general and can be applied to any one - dimensional problem .",
    "for cool white dwarfs , the most important effect of refraction on the propagation of radiation in a dispersive medium is total internal reflection .",

    "<S> we consider the problem of radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres where the index of refraction departs from unity and is a function of density and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we present modified feautrier and lambda - iteration methods to solve the equation of radiative transfer with refraction in a plane parallel atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> these methods are general and can be used in any problem with 1-d geometry where the index of refraction is a monotonically varying function of vertical optical depth . </S>",
    "<S> we present an application to very cool white dwarf atmospheres where the index of refraction departs significantly from unity . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how ray curvature and total internal reflection affect the limb darkening and the pressure - temperature structure of the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> refraction results in a much weakened limb darkening effect . </S>",
    "<S> we find that through the constraint of radiative equilibrium , total internal reflection warms the white dwarf atmosphere near the surface ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect may have a significant impact on studies of very cool white dwarf stars . </S>"
