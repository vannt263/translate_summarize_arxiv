    "we discuss chemical evolution of damped ly@xmath0 ( dla ) systems based on hierarchical structure formation .",
    "observations ( lu et al . 1996 ; prochaska & wolfe 2000 , 2002 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2003 ) show there is a baseline enrichment of [ fe / h ]  @xmath3 for dla systems . of 96 systems over the redshift range @xmath4 ,",
    "the lowest observed [ fe / h ] is @xmath5 although the newer observations could have detected much lower values ( prochaska et al .",
    "furthermore , there is a large dispersion in [ fe / h ] at any fixed @xmath6 .    in earlier discussion ( wasserburg & qian 2000b ) , we treated dla systems as closed systems formed from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) with a fixed initial inventory of `` metals '' ( the prompt inventory ) corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath7 and assumed that subsequent fe enrichment of each system was governed by a constant fe production rate per h atom in the gas of @xmath8 .",
    "element production started when a system was formed at time @xmath9 after big bang . at time @xmath10 , the number ratio ( fe / h ) of fe atoms to h atoms in the gas evolves according to @xmath11 we only treat fe contributions from type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) in all our considerations as sne ia turn on at later times .",
    "integration of equation ( [ feh ] ) gives @xmath12 as sne ii contributed @xmath13 over the period of @xmath14 gyr prior to solar system formation , @xmath8 is estimated as @xmath15 .    in this model ,",
    "the baseline fe enrichment is explained by the prompt inventory and the dispersion in [ fe / h ] at a fixed @xmath6 by the range of @xmath9 .",
    "it was found that most systems at any given @xmath6 have @xmath9 close to the age @xmath16 of the universe at this @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that the `` turn - on '' of dla systems occurs rather long after the big bang .",
    "further , essentially all the data lie below the upper bound for [ fe / h ] corresponding to @xmath17 .",
    "the above model appears to provide a reasonable description of the data on [ fe / h ] for dla systems .",
    "this is rather remarkable considering that the model ignores infall . according to hierarchical structure formation , infall is essential to formation of dla systems .",
    "here we examine chemical evolution of these systems by including infall .",
    "we wish to gain some insights into what causes most dla systems at a given @xmath6 to have @xmath9 close to @xmath16 in the closed - system model .",
    "we also address whether the prompt inventory is needed to explain the baseline fe enrichment for dla systems .",
    "consider a system of gas and stars with infall of primordial metal - free gas .",
    "the equations for evolution of the numbers of fe and h atoms [ ( fe ) and ( h ) ] in the gas are @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fe production rate of sne ii , @xmath20 is the astration rate , and @xmath21 is the infall rate .",
    "when @xmath22 is small compared to @xmath23 , ( h ) is governed by infall .",
    "equations ( [ fei ] ) and ( [ hi ] ) give ( qian & wasserburg 2003 ) @xmath24 formal integration of equation ( [ fehi ] ) gives @xmath25 with the integral term interpreted as @xmath26 , this resembles equation ( [ feht ] ) for ( fe / h)@xmath27 .",
    "so the effect of a sustained large infall rate is similar to late `` turn - on . ''    in general , equations ( [ hi ] ) and",
    "( [ fehi ] ) must be solved together . for simplicity",
    ", we first consider the case where @xmath28 so @xmath29 . we then have @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 $ ] , and @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 is negligible , a quasi - steady state is achieved and @xmath35 approximately assumes the value @xmath36 . with onset of fe production at @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 \\label{zfeta}\\ ] ] for @xmath39 . at @xmath40^{-1}$ ] , the exponential term is negligible and @xmath41 .",
    "we consider a baryonic system that is formed through infall into the potential well of a dark matter halo .",
    "the mass @xmath42 of the halo grows according to hierarchical structure formation .",
    "we assume that baryonic and dark matter are fed into the halo at a fixed mass ratio .",
    "the infall rate is then @xmath43 with @xmath44 gyr at @xmath45 , equation ( [ inf ] ) gives @xmath46    from figure 6 in barkana & loeb ( 2001 ) , we find that @xmath47 ( within a factor of 2 ) for @xmath4 . as an example , we take @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) .",
    "we numerically integrate equation ( [ zfe ] ) and show the evolution of [ fe / h ]  @xmath52 in figure 1 .",
    "the quasi - steady state value @xmath53 is a good approximation to the exact solution . for the case of evolution from a metal - free initial state without infall , @xmath54 ( the case of @xmath17 in  1 ) . in comparison with this ,",
    "fe enrichment in the case of infall is suppressed by a factor of @xmath55 , which ranges from 4.5 for @xmath56 gyr ( @xmath57 ) to 8.9 for @xmath58 gyr ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "this would explain the late `` turn - on '' requiring @xmath9 to be close to @xmath16 in the closed - system model .",
    "the data on [ fe / h ] for 96 dla systems ( prochaska et al . 2003 ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "it can be seen that the solid curve for the case of infall passes through the median of the body of the data .",
    "this curve has a slope of @xmath60}/dz\\approx -1.1/(1+z)$ ] . for @xmath61 where most of the data lie ,",
    "this slope is in good agreement with the estimate of @xmath60}/dz\\approx -0.26 $ ] given by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the growth of the mean [ fe / h ] as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "however , the above result does not explain the wide range in [ fe / h ] at a given @xmath6 .",
    "we now turn to the wide range in [ fe / h ] for dla systems at a given @xmath6 .",
    "we assume a constant fe production rate @xmath62 per h atom in the gas for @xmath63 . the infall rate @xmath64 is estimated based on hierarchical structure formation and we now allow the possibility that infall may cease at a time @xmath65 . we assume that the infall rate greatly exceeds the astration rate at @xmath66 . under these assumptions , @xmath37 and",
    "@xmath65 determine [ fe / h ] in a baryonic system at time @xmath67 ( see eqs . [ [ zfeta ] ] and [ [ zfetb ] ] ) .",
    "first consider the case where @xmath51 and infall ceases at @xmath65 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath68 is the same as for the case of infall discussed in  2 until @xmath69 . at @xmath70 , equation ( [ zfe ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath71 , which gives @xmath72 solutions for @xmath73 , 1.5 gyr ( @xmath74 ) , and 4.3 gyr ( @xmath75 ) are shown in figure 2 . in all cases of @xmath76 ,",
    "the evolution of [ fe / h ] for @xmath66 is along the solid curve labeled `` continuous infall . '' as illustrated by points a , b , and c at @xmath77 in figure 2 , a wide range of [ fe / h ] bounded by the cases of no infall @xmath78 and continuous infall can be produced at a given @xmath6 for different @xmath65 values .",
    "next consider the case where infall is continuous but @xmath37 may vary .",
    "subsequent to onset of fe production at @xmath37 , @xmath68 grows rapidly and approaches @xmath79 on a timescale of @xmath80 ( see eq . [ [ zfeta ] ] ) .",
    "this is shown in figure 1 for @xmath81 gyr ( @xmath82 ) , 2.1 gyr ( @xmath83 ) , and 3.3 gyr ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "for example , [ fe / h ] in baryonic systems formed at @xmath85 gyr first evolves rapidly , crossing [ fe / h]=-3 , and then grows more slowly toward the quasi - steay state solution .",
    "thus , values of [ fe / h ] below those for the case of @xmath51 may be populated with baryonic systems that have different @xmath37 values . then the lower range in [ fe / h ] at a given @xmath6",
    "can also be explained by the infall model",
    ".    the observed lower bound of [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 for dla systems requires attention . with infall",
    ", the growth of @xmath68 is determined by competition between @xmath62 and @xmath86 .",
    "as @xmath87 , @xmath62 governs the initial growth of @xmath68 so long as @xmath88 .",
    "we note that @xmath89 for @xmath90 gyr ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "so for systems with @xmath92 gyr ( @xmath93 ) , the growth of @xmath68 up to @xmath94 is essentially governed by @xmath49 .",
    "these systems achieve @xmath95 in @xmath2 myr and then approach @xmath96 on a timescale of @xmath80 ( see eq . [ [ zfeta ] ] and fig .",
    "thus , all baryonic systems will reach @xmath95 or greater in a very short time at @xmath97 and the probability for observing dla systems with [ fe / h ]  @xmath98 is quite small .    the ranges of @xmath37 and @xmath65 in the infall model to explain the dispersion in [ fe / h ] at a given @xmath6 are analogous to the range of @xmath9 in the closed - system model .",
    "however , uniform growth of [ fe / h ] occurs only at @xmath70 in the infall model .",
    "it is the dilution of gas by fresh infalling baryonic material that retards [ fe / h ] from uniform growth although fe production and astration has been going on since @xmath37 . to relate @xmath37 and @xmath65 for a baryonic system to properties of the halo hosting the system , we follow the discussion in barkana & loeb ( 2001 ) .",
    "the condition for a halo of mass @xmath42 associated with an @xmath99 density fluctuation ( an @xmath99 halo ) to collapse at redshift @xmath6 is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is shown in figure 5 of barkana & loeb ( 2001 ) .",
    "equation ( [ zn ] ) gives the @xmath6 values at which a fixed mass @xmath42 is reached by halos with different @xmath102 values .",
    "a @xmath103 halo today has @xmath104 and should contain @xmath105 of baryonic matter . this mass is far greater than found for a typical galaxy .",
    "thus , we may consider that infall into individual protogalaxies ceases when the accreted baryonic matter reaches @xmath106@xmath107 in a halo of @xmath108@xmath109 .",
    "in the hierarchical model , a halo of larger masses ( e.g. , @xmath110 ) may consist of a number of smaller collapsed halos instead of a single object .",
    "this also applies to the associated baryonic systems .",
    "we assume that infall ceases at @xmath65 when a halo reaches a mass of @xmath111 [ @xmath112 . this occurs at redshifts @xmath74 and 1.5 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 halos , respectively .",
    "these redshifts correspond to the @xmath65 in figure 2 and seem reasonable . for @xmath115 halos , @xmath111 is reached at @xmath116 ( @xmath117 gyr ) .",
    "the evolution of [ fe / h ] at @xmath97 ( @xmath118 gyr ) for baryonic systems inside these high @xmath119 halos is close to the case of @xmath73 .",
    "similar results are found for @xmath120@xmath109 .",
    "now consider @xmath37 , which may be taken as the onset of star formation . following the discussion in barkana & loeb ( 2001 )",
    ", the first stars appear to have formed in @xmath121 to @xmath122 halos of mass @xmath123 [ @xmath124 at @xmath12530 . for these halos , @xmath37 is only @xmath126 gyr . formation of stars at @xmath127 appears to require a minimum halo mass of @xmath128@xmath129 .",
    "we assume that star formation starts at @xmath37 when a halo reaches a mass of @xmath130 [ @xmath131 .",
    "this occurs at redshifts @xmath82 , 3 , and 2 for @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 halos , respectively .",
    "these redshifts correspond to the @xmath37 in figure 1 and again seem reasonable .",
    "similar results are found for @xmath135@xmath136 .",
    "it follows that at a given @xmath6 , baryonic systems inside different halos are in different stages of evolution .",
    "consider an example using @xmath130 and @xmath111 . at @xmath137 ,",
    "star formation just starts in a @xmath138 halo ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath139 ) , fe production competes with infall in a @xmath132 halo ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath140 , see fig .",
    "1 ) , and uniform growth of [ fe / h ] has been going on since infall cessation at @xmath74 in a @xmath113 halo ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath141 , see fig .",
    "2 ) . for a sample of dla systems at @xmath137 , systems with @xmath142\\leq -1.9 $ ] ,",
    "@xmath143\\leq -1.4 $ ] , and @xmath144>-1.4 $ ] are then associated with @xmath99 halos with @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 , respectively .",
    "statistically speaking , the fraction of halos more evolved than an @xmath99 halo is @xmath148 .",
    "thus , we expect the occurrences of @xmath149}\\leq -1.9 $ ] , @xmath150}\\leq -1.4 $ ] , and [ fe / h ]  @xmath151 at @xmath137 to be in the ratios of @xmath152:[f(1.1)-f(1.9)]:f(1.9)\\approx 0.7:1:0.3 $ ] .",
    "of 19 dla systems at @xmath153 , the numbers of systems in the above [ fe / h ] intervals are 5 , 10 , and 4 , consistent with expectation from our model .",
    "we have treated chemical evolution of dla systems considering astration and infall .",
    "it is assumed that the h in the gas is initially controlled by infall of primordial metal - free baryonic matter and the fe production rate per h atom in the gas is constant subsequent to onset of star formation in a system . with the infall rate estimated from the standard scenario of hierarchical structure formation",
    ", this model yields an explanation for the data on [ fe / h ] in dla systems .",
    "it is shown that the slow growth of [ fe / h ] with decreasing @xmath6 is a direct consequence of competition between enrichment by fe production and dilution by infall .",
    "it is argued that the upper range of [ fe / h ] at a given @xmath6 results from the different times at which individual halos associated with protogalaxies reach a mass of @xmath154 and infall ceases or greatly diminishes .",
    "it is also argued that the lower range of [ fe / h ] results from the different times at which individual halos reach a minimum mass of @xmath128@xmath129 required to initiate astration .",
    "because the initial growth of [ fe / h ] up to @xmath155 is very rapid subsequent to onset of astration , the probability of observing dla systems with [ fe / h ]  @xmath98 is very small .",
    "the approach presented here appears to be a reasonably quantitative description of chemical evolution of dla systems that is compatible with the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "of the available data , only three points lie outside the upper bound of the model and these are still within a factor of 2 of this bound .",
    "we assumed the astration rate is small compared to the infall rate during the infall phase .",
    "if we assume a constant astration rate @xmath0 per h atom in the gas consistent with the fe production rate , then equation ( [ hi ] ) reduces to @xmath156 , which can be solved explicitly .",
    "as long as @xmath157 , ( h ) increases .",
    "when infall ceases , ( h ) reaches the maximum value ( h)@xmath158 and the star formation rate also reaches the maximum value @xmath159 .",
    "subsequently , the gas will be depleted by star formation on a timescale of @xmath160 . when a protogalaxy would reach its maximum star formation rate depends on when its associated halo reaches a mass of @xmath154 and infall ceases .",
    "this occurs at @xmath161 and 4.3 for @xmath103 and @xmath162 halos , respectively .",
    "the extent to which the approach outlined here can be used to quantitatively explain the cosmic star formation history remains to be explored .    in earlier works ( wasserburg & qian 2000a ; qian & wasserburg 2002 )",
    ", we proposed that very massive ( @xmath163 ) stars ( vmss ) produced the elements from c to the fe group to explain the observed jump in the abundances of heavy @xmath164-process elements ( ba and above ) at [ fe / h ] @xmath1 .",
    "the vmss produced no heavy @xmath164-elements but dominated chemical evolution at [ fe / h ]  @xmath98 .",
    "this evolution resulted in a prompt inventory of `` metals '' corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 in the igm .",
    "cessation of vms activities and rapid occurrence of a hypothesized sn ii source for heavy @xmath164-elements then led to an explanation for the observed jump in abundances of these elements at [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 .",
    "the dominance of vms activities at [ fe / h ]  @xmath98 and transition to normal astration at [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 are in accord with the theoretical study of bromm et al .",
    "they showed there is a critical metallicity corresponding to @xmath165}<-3 $ ] above which normal star formation should occur .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that the number of vmss required to produce [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 would also provide enough photons to reionize the igm .",
    "qian , sargent , & wasserburg ( 2002 ) showed that the abundances of c , o , and si in ly@xmath0 forests appear to be consistent with the corresponding prompt inventory .",
    "the observed lower bound of [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 for dla systems was interpreted by wasserburg & qian ( 2000b ) as strong evidence in support of the prompt inventory model .",
    "thus , there was a general accord between very different approaches .",
    "there are now two considerations that require a re - evaluation of the prompt inventory model .",
    "qian & wasserburg ( 2003 ) proposed that the possible sources for heavy @xmath164-elements are accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of white dwarfs and low - mass ( @xmath166@xmath167 ) sne ii , with the most likely source being aic events .",
    "if aic events instead of sne ii are the dominant source for heavy @xmath164-elements , the jump in abundances of these elements at [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 can be attributed to the delay in turn - on of these events relative to sne ii without invoking vmss .",
    "we showed here that the growth of [ fe / h ] to @xmath155 from a metal - free initial state is very rapid ( in @xmath2 myr ) .",
    "so the probability of finding dla systems with [ fe / h ]  @xmath98 is very low and the observed lower bound of [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 can no longer be considered as an argument in favor of the prompt inventory model .",
    "a prompt inventory corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath1 is thus not required to explain the data on dla systems but is also not in conflict with the interpretation of these data using the infall model .",
    "however , if there is no prompt inventory , a question remains regarding the approximately constant metallicity of the igm over @xmath168 ( songaila 2001 ; pettini et al .",
    "2003 ) . at present , it is not obvious how this can be explained by the infall model . without vmss associated with production of the prompt inventory , the source for reionization may also be a problem .",
    "we wish to dedicate this paper to allan sandage for galaxies of reasons .",
    "we thank jason prochaska for making available the new data that stimulated us to further consider dla systems .",
    "intense questioning by michael norman on the requirement of vmss and a prompt inventory in our earlier models also provided a great stimulus .",
