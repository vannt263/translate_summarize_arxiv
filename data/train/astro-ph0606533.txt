    "various cosmological probes such as supernovae in distant galaxies @xcite , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) sky @xcite , and the galaxy redshift surveys @xcite have given strong evidence that a dark energy component , such as the cosmological constant , constitutes approximately @xmath12 of the total energy density of the universe , which derives the accelerating cosmic expansion at low redshifts . because there is no plausible theoretical explanation for its existence and magnitude ( e.g. see @xcite ) ,",
    "observational exploration of the nature of dark energy is one of the most important issues in modern cosmology as well as particle physics .",
    "an observational dark energy task we should first explore to tackle this fundamental problem would be to determine whether the accelerating expansion is as a consequence of the cosmological constant . relaxing this assumption leads to a generalized dark energy with dynamically evolving energy density , which can be characterized by a time - dependent equation of state @xmath13 ( the cosmological constant corresponds to @xmath14 ) . the current level of accuracy in constraining the constant @xmath15-parameter is @xmath16 at @xmath17 level with the best - fit value containing a model with @xmath14 ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "future prospects aimed at pinning down the constraint on @xmath15 by a factor of 10 have been extensively investigated to address the usefulness of various cosmological experiments based on massive galaxy surveys such as tomographic weak lensing experiment ( e.g. @xcite ) , the baryon oscillation experiment ( e.g. @xcite ) and the cluster abundance experiment ( e.g. @xcite ) .    another important consequence of a generalized dark energy is the spatial perturbation , providing an independent clue to resolving the nature of dark energy from the equation of state .",
    "there are many previous efforts made to study how an inclusion of the dark energy perturbations modify the cold dark matter ( cdm ) structure formation scenarios : theoretical predictions on the modifications in the cmb power spectra and the galaxy power spectra @xcite and the observational exploration of the dark energy clustering signal from the wmap data at low multipoles @xcite .",
    "the dark energy clustering is relevant only for structure formation at low redshifts @xmath11 , where the net energy density is dominant to the cosmic expansion .",
    "in addition , a reasonable model including the dark energy perturbation predicts that the dark energy can cluster together with matter components at large spatial scales ( inevitably at super - horizon scales ) , whilst the dark energy is smooth at small scales so that the additional component does not largely change the small - scale structure formations such as galaxy formation . for these reasons ,",
    "the dark energy clustering effect on the cmb observables is likely to appear only via the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ) at low multipoles , where the sachs - wolfe effect generated at the recombination epoch is significant contamination to separate the isw effect from the measured power spectrum .",
    "the transition scale to divide the dark energy clustering and smooth regimes can be usefully modeled by the effective sound speed of dark energy @xcite . in this model ,",
    "smoothness of dark energy can be tested by searching for the signature of the sound speed from cosmological observables .",
    "hu and scranton @xcite carefully investigated a prospect of how the isw effect measured via the angular cross - correlation between cmb and galaxy distribution can be used to probe the dark energy clustering , assuming an all - sky , deep multi - color imaging galaxy survey out to @xmath18 .",
    "a galaxy redshift survey offers an alternative means for probing the dark energy clustering , through the measured statistical properties of three - dimensional gravitational clustering at largest scales .",
    "compared to the angular correlations , from a cosmological point of view , the redshift survey carries more information on the underlying mass distribution due to a gain of the modes along the line - of - sight or redshift direction .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this paper is to , for the first time , investigate the ability of a galaxy redshift survey for testing the smoothness of dark energy from the measured galaxy power spectrum .",
    "in fact , there are several future plans for high - redshift galaxy surveys that are already being constructed or seriously under consideration : the fiber multiple object spectrograph ( fmos ) on subaru telescope @xcite , its significantly expanded version , wfmos @xcite , the hobby ",
    "ebery telescope dark energy experiment ( hetdex ) @xcite , and the cosmic inflation probe ( cip ) mission @xcite . these surveys probe galaxies at higher redshifts @xmath19 than the existing surveys such as sdss and 2df surveys .",
    "such a high - redshift survey has several advantages over the lower redshift ones .",
    "first , given a fixed solid angle , the comoving volume in which we can observe galaxies is larger at higher redshifts than in the local universe , thereby reducing the sample variance .",
    "this would make it more straightforward to obtain a well - behaved survey geometry that can help measure largest - scale perturbations .",
    "second , density perturbations at smaller spatial scales are still in the linear regime or only in the weakly non - linear regime at higher redshift , which gives us more leverages on measuring the shape of the linear power spectrum to break the parameter degeneracies . in this paper , we will consider the survey design close to the proposed wfmos survey , which consists two types of surveys different in redshift coverage and survey area : @xmath20 with 2000 degree@xmath3 and @xmath21 with @xmath22 degree@xmath3 , respectively .",

    "to model dark energy clustering , we employ a phenomenological model developed in @xcite . in this model , the stress perturbation of dark energy , which governs properties of the dark energy clustering , is usefully specified by the dark energy equation of state and the effective sound speed @xmath4 , where the latter is needed to model the non - adiabatic stress perturbation ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "the effective sound speed of a generalized dark energy is defined as @xmath36 in a `` rest frame '' coordinate system where the momentum density of the dark energy vanishes . for a more general coordinate system such as newtonian gauge , the pressure perturbation of dark energy , which enters into the r.h.s . of the momentum conservation equation , can be expressed as @xmath37 where the first and second terms in the first line on the r.h.s .",

    "we expect that this modeling to treat the sound speed as a free parameter can cover a broader range of dark energy models rather than working with a specific model of the lagrangian of dark energy sector . for a scalar field dark energy model ,",
    "the sound speed can be exactly computed in linear theory in terms of the kinetic energy as a function of the field @xcite . for the case of a canonical kinetic energy term such as the quintessence @xcite , the sound speed @xmath5 . for a more general modification of the kinetic term such as a phantom energy @xcite and a k - essence field @xcite , a general value of @xmath4 including @xmath49 is allowed .",

    "the ability is to enlarge the survey volume especially for low redshift slices at @xmath0 .",
    "an ultimate full - sky survey could improve the lower bound on the detectable @xmath4 by a factor of 2 .",
    "another interesting possibility of the future galaxy survey is the use of the galaxy power spectrum to weigh the neutrino mass , as investigated in @xcite .",
    "we carefully investigate possible degeneracies between the dark energy clustering and the non - relativistic neutrinos in the galaxy power spectrum ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pk_fnu - ce ] and also see @xcite for the related discussion on the degeneracy between the neutrino mass and the dark energy equation of state ) . we showed that having a wider redshift coverage can efficiently separate the two effects by utilizing the different redshift dependences ; the dark energy is prominent only at low redshifts @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , modified gravity theories have received much recent attention as an alternative explanation of cosmic acceleration without dark energy , where gravity is weaker than the einstein gravity at scales comparable to the horizon ( e.g. , @xcite ) . an important test",
    "to discriminate this possibility from the dark energy model is to simultaneously explore the cosmic expansion history and the growth of structure formation from cosmological experiments , because the two possibilities predict different growth rate even for an identical expansion history .",
    "once again , wider redshift coverage of a galaxy redshift survey would be powerful to make a robust test of discriminating between effects of dark energy clustering , massive neutrinos , and modified gravity , which warrants a detailed study ( also see @xcite for the discussion on the interplay between the massive neutrinos and the modified gravity in the shape of mass power spectrum ) .",
    "we hope that the results shown in this paper will give a useful guidance to designing a future survey if the dark energy clustering is desired to pursue as one of the science goals .",
    "we have assumed throughout this paper that dynamical properties of the dark energy are specified in terms of the equation of state and the effective sound speed , with the adiabatic initial condition . a merit of this approach is we need not assume a specific form of the lagrangian of dark energy sector .",
    "however , the limitation is there is no guarantee this modeling can be applied to a full range of generic dark energy models .",
    "for example , we have ignored a contribution from the trace - free stress perturbation of dark energy , which is valid if the dark energy is a scalar field ( e.g. see @xcite for the extension ) .",
    "since we have little idea of what dark energy is , it is worth exploring a more general modeling of dark energy properties and investigate the resulting effect on structure formation .",
    "unless such a theoretical model is available , we can not extract all the cosmological information inherent in the future high - precision cosmological data sets in an unbiased way .",
    "another non - trivial assumption we have made in this paper is the adiabatic initial conditions for dark energy perturbations , without any rigorous reasoning .",
    "if the dark energy field had existed since the inflationary epoch in the early universe , the dark energy perturbations naturally contained iso - curvature modes , and the effect just emerges at low redshifts .",
    "hence , a galaxy redshift survey could by its own open up a new window for exploring the iso - curvature modes in structure formation to probe the physics in the early universe , complementarily to the cmb or the cmb - galaxy cross correlation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the primordial non - gaussianity ( e.g. see @xcite for a thorough review ) is dominantly imprinted onto the sector of dark energy , the galaxy survey allows us to explore the signal via , e.g. , the bispectrum measurement of galaxy clustering .",
    "these are our future study and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the linear perturbation theory makes secure predictions on structure formation , which allows an accurate interpretation of the cosmological data sets from the detailed comparison . a main obstacle that a galaxy redshift survey could contain in this procedure",
    "is uncertainties involved in the galaxy biasing , where unknown , non - linear gastrophysics may pollute the linear information even at large scales .",
    "although we have assumed a scale - independent , linear bias , we do not think that a more realistic bias such as a scale - dependent bias is a significant contamination to the dark energy clustering constraint . because the dark energy clustering induces characteristic scale - dependent modification and strong redshift evolution for @xmath102 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pk ] ) , these properties can be very robust to discriminate the dark energy clustering signals from the galaxy bias contamination or more generally other systematics .    finally , we comment on the non - linear gravitational clustering , which could also provide a contamination to the linear theory predictions .",
    "encouragingly , however , the non - linear effects can be to some extent corrected based on our refined knowledge of the structure formation scenarios , based on the perturbation theory as well as the n - body simulations @xcite . furthermore , as an interesting possibility , coupling of different fourier modes induced by non - linear gravitational clustering could induce a transfer of the dark energy clustering effect at large scales to the power of @xmath102 at smaller scales .",
    "if this is the case to be apparent on the measured power spectrum , an inclusion of the non - linearity in the model predictions could improve a signal - to - noise to test smoothness of dark energy , from the smaller - scale clustering information .",
    "this issue will be worth exploring in detail , and will be presented elsewhere .",
