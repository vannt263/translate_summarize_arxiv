    "two - photon collisions at electron positron storage rings are a good laboratory to investigate the properties of meson resonances and play a crucial role in glueball searches .",
    "a resonant state r can be formed by the collision of two photons via the reaction @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ggr ] ) .",
    "the outgoing electron and positron are usually scattered at very small angles and are not detected ( no - tag mode ) . in this case",
    "the two photons are quasi real and the resonant state r must be neutral and unflavoured with c=1 and j@xmath31 . if one of the two photons is highly virtual , the outgoing electron or positron can be detected at low angle and the spin of the resonant state is allowed to be one ( single - tag mode ) . in both cases the two outgoing particles carry nearly the full beam energy and the mass of the resonant state is much smaller than the @xmath4 centre of mass energy . this fact allows a clean separation between the two - photon and the annihilation process by using a cut in the visible energy . since there are no particles produced other than r , the reconstruction of the final state can be performed in a very clean experimental environment .    the cross section for this process",
    "is given by the convolution of the qed calculable luminosity function @xmath5 , giving the flux of the virtual photons , with the two - photon cross section @xmath6 that is expressed by the breit - wigner function @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the invariant mass of the two - photon system , @xmath9 , j , @xmath10 and @xmath11r ) are the mass , spin , two - photon partial width and total width of r , respectively .",
    "this leads to the proportionality relation @xmath12 that allows to extract the two - photon width from the cross section .",
    "the proportionality factor @xmath13 is evaluated by a monte carlo integration .    in the single tag - mode the high virtuality of one of the two photons",
    "is taken into account by multiplying the breit - wigner function by a vdm pole transition form factor @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the four vector squared of the virtual photon and @xmath16 is a parameter to be measured experimentally .    since gluons do not couple directly to photons , the two photon width of a glueball",
    "is expected to be very small .",
    "a state that can be formed in a gluon rich environment but not in two photon fusion has the typical signature of a glueball . according to lattice qcd predictions  @xcite",
    ", the ground state glueball has j@xmath17= 0@xmath18 and a mass between 1400 and 1800 mev .",
    "the 2@xmath18 tensor glueball is expected in the mass region around 2200 mev while the 0@xmath19 pseudoscalar glueball is predicted to be heavier . since several 0@xmath18 states",
    "have been observed in the 1400 - 1800 mev mass region , the scalar ground state glueball can mix with nearby quarkonia , making the search for the scalar glueball and the interpretation of the scalar meson nonet a complex problem  @xcite  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the results from two - photon formation represent therefore a fundamental piece of information for glueball searches .    in order to distinguish ordinary quarkonia from glueballs ,",
    "a parameter called stickiness has been introduced  @xcite .",
    "the stickiness is an estimate of the ratio @xmath20 evaluated from the the ratio @xmath21 corrected by a phase space factor .",
    "the @xmath22 mesons have the largest stickiness among quarkonia ( 14.7 for the f@xmath23(1525 ) ) while much larger values are expected for glueballs .",
    "because of the large mass of the charm quark , the study of the formation of charmonium states allows to test non - relativistic perturbative qcd calculations and to measure @xmath24 at the charm scale .",
    "two e@xmath0e@xmath1 colliders have collected a large amount of data in the last few years .",
    "the four lep experiments aleph , delphi , l3 and opal at cern have collected approximately 150 , 55 , 175 , 240 pb@xmath25 each at @xmath26 91 , 183 , 189 , 191 - 202 gev respectively . the cleo experiment at cesr ( cornell )",
    "has collected about 3000 pb@xmath25 at @xmath26 10.6 gev .",
    "since the luminosity function @xmath5 increases with the beam energy , the higher energy allows lep to partially compensate the smaller luminosity by a larger cross section .    in this paper",
    "the most recent results on resonance formation and glueball searches obtained at lep and cesr are reviewed .",
    "a study of the reaction @xmath28 is performed by l3  @xcite  @xcite using only untagged events .",
    "the mass spectrum ( fig .  [ fig : a2 ] ) is dominated by the formation of the a@xmath29(1320 ) tensor meson .",
    "a clear enhancement is visible around 1750 mev where the study of the total transverse momentum distribution shows evidence for an exclusive process .",
    "the study of the angular distributions shows that the a@xmath29 formation is dominated by a j@xmath17=2@xmath18 helicity 2 wave .",
    "the radiative width is found to be @xmath30 kev . a spin - parity analysis in the mass region above the a@xmath29(1320 )",
    "shows that also this region is dominated by a j@xmath17=2@xmath18 helicity 2 wave , confirming the observation of the cern - ihep collaboration  @xcite and in contradiction with cello  @xcite and crystal ball  @xcite measurements .",
