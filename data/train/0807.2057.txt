    "the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation continues to play a key role in the determination of distances within the local group and to nearby galaxies .",
    "the absolute calibration of the pl relation requires reliable distance measurements for calibrating cepheids as well as accurate corrections for the effects of interstellar reddening and extinction .",
    "galactic cepheids are often heavily obscured , the average colour excess e(_b  v _ ) being of order 0.5 mag .",
    "here we propose a new method of accurate colour excess determination that relies on spectroscopically determined stellar parameters .",
    "the traditional methods of establishing the interstellar reddening of cepheids have involved field reddenings derived from photometric and spectroscopic studies of stars surrounding the cepheid , the use of reddening - independent spectroscopic indices , and period - colour relations calibrated from spectroscopic analyses of a number of well - studied cepheids or supergiants .",
    "field reddenings are fairly reliable provided that the surrounding stars are unaffected by circumstellar reddening , although the number of suitable objects has tended to be restricted to cluster cepheids and visual binaries ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "reddening - independent indices include the @xmath8 index @xcite , which measures the depression in stellar spectra caused by the _ g _ band of ch ( @xmath9 ) , and the _ khg _ index @xcite , which combines narrow band photometry of ca ii k ( @xmath10 ) , balmer h@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and the _ g _ band .",
    "narrow band photometry of balmer h@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) has also been used as a temperature indicator for fgk stars , but has been susceptible to problems arising from colour dependences introduced by mismatches in the effective wavelengths of the narrow and wide h@xmath13 filters employed @xcite .",
    "most cepheid reddenings have been derived from period - colour relations that are tied to specific cepheid or supergiant calibrators , in which specific continuum or spectral line features ( line ratios , for example ) are linked to stellar atmosphere models to infer effective temperatures for the stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the direct link between effective temperature and broad band ( _ b ",
    "v_)@xmath15 colour has been demonstrated very effectively by @xcite for older , published , stellar atmosphere models , and has been used successfully to test the open cluster calibration of the pl relation @xcite . as argued by @xcite ,",
    "_ b  v _ colours for cepheids appear to be more closely indicative of stellar temperatures than indices that include a near - infrared magnitude .",
    "but recent changes to stellar atmosphere models @xcite may affect the effective temperature scale for fgk supergiants significantly enough that a recalibration is necessary .",
    "that is the purpose of the present study .",
    "cepheids also undergo significant changes in effective temperature during their pulsation cycles , which makes it essential to track such changes accurately through close monitoring of individual variables .",
    "photometric monitoring of cepheids has resulted in a large database of published results for many different colour systems @xcite , but the availability of high resolution spectra for such stars throughout their cycles has been extremely limited , until now .",
    "a goal of the present study is therefore to exploit a recently developed collection of high resolution spectra for galactic cepheids in order to present accurate intrinsic parameters for all of the studied objects .",
    "the spectra of the fgk supergiants studied here were obtained using the 1.93 m telescope of the haute - provence observatoire ( france ) equipped with the echelle spectrograph elodie @xcite and retrieved from its on - line archive of spectra @xcite .",
    "the resolving power for the observations was @xmath16 over the wavelength interval 44006800  , with a signal - to - noise ratio for each spectrum of s / n@xmath17100 ( at 5500  ) .",
    "initial processing of the spectra ( image extraction , cosmic ray removal , flatfielding , etc . ) was carried out as described by @xcite .",
    "we also made use of spectra obtained with the ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) instrument at the very large telescope ( vlt ) unit 2 kueyen @xcite .",
    "all supergiants were observed in two instrumental modes , @xmath18 ( dic1 ) and @xmath19 ( dic2 ) , in order to provide almost complete coverage of the wavelength interval @xmath20  . the spectral resolution is about 80000 , and for most of the spectra the typical s / n ratio is 300500 in the _ v _ band .    for classical cepheids in our sample we have used our previously published results @xcite .",
    "multiphase observations of program cepheids were carried out using the struve 2.1-m reflector and sandiford echelle spectrograph at mcdonald observatory .",
    "the nominal resolving power was 60000 with a total spectral range covering about @xmath21  .",
    "the primary wavelength region was centered at 6200  .",
    "exposure times were selected to ensure an optimal s / n ratio of about 100 .",
    "additional processing of the spectra ( continuum level location , measuring of line depths and equivalent widths ) was carried out using the dech20 software @xcite .",
    "line depths r@xmath22 were measured by means of gaussian fitting .",
    "effective temperatures for our program stars were established from the processed spectra using the method developed by @xcite that is based upon @xmath0line depth relations",
    ". the technique can establish @xmath0 with exceptional precision .",
    "it relies upon the ratio of the central depths of two lines that have very different functional dependences on @xmath0 , and uses tens of pairs of lines for each spectrum .",
    "the method is independent of interstellar reddening , and only marginally dependent on the individual characteristics of stars , such as rotation , microturbulence , metallicity , etc .",
    "briefly , a set of 131 line ratio@xmath0 relations was employed , with the mean random error in a single calibration being 6090k ( 4045k in most cases and 9095k in the least accurate cases ) .",
    "the use of @xmath2370100 calibrations per spectrum reduces the uncertainty in @xmath0 to 1020k for spectra with s / n ratios greater than 100 , and 3050k for spectra with s / n ratios less than 100 .",
    "although the internal error for each @xmath0 determination appears to be small , a systematic shift of the zero - point in the @xmath0 scale may exist .",
    "nevertheless , an uncertainty in zero - point ( if it exists ) can affect the absolute abundances derived for each program star .",
    "it is relatively unimportant for abundance comparisons between stars in the sample . for the majority of supergiants and cepheids we obtain error estimates for @xmath0 that are smaller than 1040 k.    the microturbulent velocities , @xmath2 , and surface gravities , @xmath1 , were derived using a modification of the standard analysis proposed by @xcite .",
    "as described there , the microturbulence is determined from the fe  ii lines rather than the fe  i lines , as in classical abundance analyses .",
    "the surface gravity is established by forcing equality between the total iron abundance obtained from both fe  i and fe  ii lines . typically with this method",
    "the iron abundance determined from fe  i lines shows a strong dependence on equivalent width ( nlte effects ) , so we take as the proper iron abundance the extrapolated total iron abundance at zero equivalent width .",
    "kurucz s width9 code was used with an atmospheric model for each star interpolated from a grid of models calculated with a microturbulent velocity of 4 km s@xmath24 . at some phases",
    "cepheids can have microturbulent velocities deviating significantly from that value ; however , our previous test calculations suggest that changes in the model microturbulence over a range of several km s@xmath24 has an insignificant impact on the resulting element abundances .",
    "typical results obtained for the cepheid @xmath11 cep over its cycle are shown for illustrative purposes in fig . 1 .",
    "final results for our determinations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( in km s@xmath24 ) , and [ fe / h ] for fgk supergiants in our sample are given in table 1 .",
    "typical uncertainties in the cited values are @xmath25 k in @xmath0 , @xmath26 in @xmath1 , and @xmath27 km s@xmath24 in @xmath2 .    [",

    "tables 1 and 2 list the results for fgk supergiants and classical cepheids , respectively . for cepheids",

    "the mean value of e(_b  v _ ) was obtained by averaging the values of e(_b  v _ ) over the pulsation cycle .",
    "individual reddenings estimated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are also listed for convenience in table 2 , in columns ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) respectively .",
    "a comparison of the reddenings of @xcite with the present results is shown in fig . 4 , and comparisons with the reddenings of @xcite and @xcite are shown in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "a statistical comparison of the present cepheid reddenings was made with an overlapping set of space reddenings for 27 stars in common .",
    "the space reddenings are those summarized by @xcite , but with additional data used in a previous analysis of cepheid reddenings @xcite that includes new estimates for previously - unstudied objects @xcite .",
    "four of the objects in the sample display large differences in reddening between the two data sets , in excess of @xmath29e(_b  v _ ) = 0.1 , namely v cen , s nor , vy sgr , and wz sgr .",
    "all are southern hemisphere cepheids , noted to be a problem in the previous section , and the first three have only single spectroscopic observations available .",
    "multiple observations ( @xmath30 ) exist for wz sgr , but its space reddening has been noted previously to be a problem @xcite .",
    "for the 23 remaining cepheids the difference in colour excesses @xmath29e(_b  v_)(space reddening  spectroscopic reddening ) is @xmath31 s.d . , and @xmath32 s.d .",
    "for the 16 cepheids with multiple spectroscopic observations .",
    "it appears that the present compilation of spectroscopic reddenings for cepheids is tied closely to the system of available space reddenings .",
    "in addition , since the average uncertainty for the space reddenings of individual cepheids in the sample is @xmath33 , the precision of the spectroscopic reddenings based upon multiple spectra must be @xmath6 , while the accuracy matches that of the space reddening system .",
    "the reddening system of the present study also appears to be closely matched to older reddening systems for cepheids , as indicated by the trends of figs .",
    "the scatter in the plots of figs .",
    "4 and 5 is suggestive of actual differences that may exist , which may have several explanations .",
    "period - colour relations , for example , do not always account for the intrinsic dispersion of cepheids within the instability strip . small amplitude cepheids tend to lie on the hot edge of the strip , for example @xcite , so their reddenings can be underestimated by period - colour relations .",
    "large amplitude cepheids lie near the centre of the strip ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but may not always be representative of the calibrators used .",
    "although similar scatter is seen in the fig .",
    "6 , where the present results are compared with the space reddening system of @xcite , the discrepant points in most cases represent cepheids for which only single spectra are available . here",
    "the problem is not of differences in reddening systems , but problems in the measurements for individual cepheids .",
    "all cepheids undergo period changes @xcite , some undergo random fluctuations in period @xcite , and others display light travel time effects from binarity and other curious changes to the times of light maximum @xcite that affect the accurate determination of light curve phasing , all of which are important factors for reddenings derived from spectroscopic and photometric observations . as noted previously , the problem is particularly acute for the present study when only one spectrum has been obtained ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is the case for many of the cepheids in the present sample .",
    "a number of objects in table 2 are also suspected to be type ii cepheids , but their [ fe / h ] values are nearly solar according to the spectroscopic analyses .",
    "another comparison that can be made is with respect to colours derived from model atmospheres .",
    "such a comparison is shown in fig . 7 , where the models ( solid dots ) are @xcite models with the colours given by @xcite .",
    "the models are for @xmath1 = 2.0 , @xmath2 = 2.0 km s@xmath24 , and [ fe / h ] = 0.0 . the same parameters were used to generate intrinsic colours from the calibration determined here . as can be seen",
    ", the comparison is rather good . over the larger part of the range the spectroscopic temperatures used here are 50100 k lower than the temperatures that would be determined using the photometric calibration . another way of stating this is that , at a fixed temperature , the theoretical photometric calibration would yield a",
    "_ b  v _ colour excess about 0.05 mag .",
    "smaller than found here .",
    "the difference between spectroscopic and photometric temperatures found here for high luminosity stars is in the same sense and magnitude as that found for spectroscopic versus photometric temperatures of dwarfs and giants @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that high - resolution spectroscopic studies of cepheids provide an independent source of reddenings that can be used to refine the existing reddening scale for galactic cepheids and to enhance the precision of the cepheid p ",
    "l relation .",
    "the colour excesses derived for cepheids in our sample for which many spectra are available are quite likely more accurate than many previous estimates , and provide a good test of published reddening scales .",
    "additional spectroscopic observations of cepheids in our sample can only strengthen the present results , since they would eliminate the undersampling problem inherent to program obejects with @xmath34 . correcting",
    "that deficiency should improve the precision of the overall sample .",
    "the present study presents newly - derived parameters , namely effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath1 ) , microturbulent velocity ( @xmath2 , in km s@xmath24 ) , and iron abundance ( [ fe / h ] ) , for 74 non - variable fgk supergiants , established from model atmosphere analyses of high resolution spectra for the stars .",
    "colour excesses have been computed for the stars on the basis of a new formulation of the relationship linking such parameters to intrinsic colour , ( _ b  v_)@xmath15 .",
    "the formulation has been extended to the 74 fgk supergiants and to a sample of 164 classical cepheid variables to derive new estimates for their colour excesses e(_b  v _ ) , presented in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the reddening estimates are demonstrated to be of extremely high internal precision , and to agree well with the most accurate estimates from the literature .",
    "the cepheid reddenings , in particular , appear to be closely tied to the system of space reddenings that is presently available .",
    "given the large distances of supergiants , the method opens the possibility for large - scale extinction mapping of the galaxy , with a sensitivity of 0.080.2 magnitude .",
    "this work is based on spectra collected with the 1.93-m telescope of the ohp ( france ) and the eso telescopes at the paranal observatory under programme id266.d-5655 .",
