    "almost 200 molecules have been detected in the interstellar medium or circumstellar shells so far . in dark clouds , unsaturated carbon - chain molecules such as ccs are abundant , whereas they decrease in star forming cores @xcite .",
    "these carbon - chain molecules are formed from c or c@xmath12 in the gas phase before carbon atoms are converted into co. on the other hand , saturated complex organic molecules such as ch@xmath3oh and ch@xmath3cn increase in star forming regions , and these regions are called hot cores for high - mass star forming regions and hot corinos for low - mass star forming regions . in hot cores and hot corinos ,",
    "the combination between grain - surface reactions and gas - phase reactions produces various saturated complex organic molecules .",
    "recently , in contrast to the above scenarios , several star forming cores associated with carbon - chain molecules have been discovered .",
    "@xcite showed that various carbon - chain molecules are abundant toward the low - mass star forming region l1527 .",
    "several chemical model calculations showed that ch@xmath13 plays an essential role in efficient formation of carbon - chain molecules in the warm regions ( @xmath14 k ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite indicated that carbon - chain molecules are formed by a combination of gas - phase reactions and grain - surface reactions following the sublimation of ch@xmath13 .",
    "these low - mass star forming regions were named warm carbon chain chemistry ( wccc ) sources .",
    "cyanopolyynes ( hc@xmath15n ) are one of the representative carbon - chain - molecule series .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that regeneration of carbon - chain molecules results from gas - phase chemistry and showed the primary formation pathway of hc@xmath3n as follows :    @xmath16    @xcite presented their time - dependent gas - phase chemical model and showed that cyanopolyynes ( hc@xmath15n ; @xmath17 ) can be formed under hot core conditions .",
    "they considered that c@xmath11h@xmath11 is released from the grain mantle inside hot cores and the neutral - neutral reaction between c@xmath11h@xmath11 and cn ( reaction ( [ r6 ] ) ) proceeds relatively easily for the hot core temperature ( @xmath18 k ) .",
    "their chemical model calculation was supported by detections of hc@xmath19n toward 35 hot cores associated with 6.7 ghz methanol masers @xcite .",
    "therefore , the predicted main formation pathway of hc@xmath3n is reaction ( [ r6 ] ) in both the low - mass star forming region l1527 and the high - mass star forming regions .",
    "deriving @xmath2c isotopic fractionation of carbon - chain molecules by observations is one of the promising methods to constrain their main formation mechanism .",
