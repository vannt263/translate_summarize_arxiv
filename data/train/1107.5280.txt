    "it happens often in engineering optimization problems ( see @xcite ) that the objective function and constraints can be multiextremal , non - differentiable , and partially defined .",

    "we suppose hereafter that all of them consist of intervals of a finite length .",
    "we assume also that the functions @xmath12 , satisfy the corresponding lipschitz conditions g_j(x)-g_j(x  ) l_j x-x  , x,xq_j,1 jm+1 , [ 4 ] 0 < l_j<,1jm+1 .",
    "[ 5 ]    in order to illustrate the problem under consideration and to highlight its difference with respect to problems where constraints and the objective function are defined over the whole search region , let us consider an example  test problem number  6 from @xcite shown in figure  [ fig6_2 ] .",
    "the problem has two multiextremal constraints and is formulated as follows f^*=f(x^*)=\\{f(x ) : g_1(x ) 0 , g_2(x ) 0 , x } , [ example_-1 ] where g_3(x ) f(x ) = \\ {    ll ( x^2 + ) , & x , + ( x ) + , & < x , + ( x^2- x+ ) , & x > ,    . [ example_3 ]",

    "it can be seen from figure  [ fig6_1 ] that both @xmath17 and @xmath0 are partially defined : @xmath17 is defined only over @xmath18 and the objective function @xmath0 is defined only over @xmath19 which coincides with the admissible region of problem ( [ example_-1])([example_5 ] ) .",
    "it is not easy to find a traditional algorithm for solving problem ( [ 6])([5 ] ) .",
    "for example , the penalty approach requires that @xmath0 and @xmath20 are defined over the whole search interval @xmath21 $ ] . at first glance",
    "it seems that at the regions where a function is not defined it can be simply filled in with either a big number or the function value at the nearest feasible point .",
    "unfortunately , in the context of lipschitz algorithms , incorporating such ideas can lead to infinitely high lipschitz constants , causing degeneration of the methods and non - applicability of the penalty approach .    a promising approach called the _ index scheme _",
    "has been proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in combination with information stochastic bayesian algorithms for solving problem ( [ 6])([5 ] ) .",
    "an important advantage of the index scheme is that it does not introduce additional variables and/or parameters as traditional approaches do ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "it has been recently shown in @xcite that the index scheme can be also successfully used in combination with the branch - and - bound approach if the lipschitz constants @xmath22 from ( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) are known a priori",

    "adaptively estimating the local lipschitz constants during the search is proposed .",
    "the local tuning technique introduced in @xcite for solving unconstrained problems allows one to accelerate the search significantly in comparison with the methods using estimates of the global lipschitz constant .",
    "the new method alt unifies this approach with the index scheme and geometric ideas allowing one to construct auxiliary functions similar to minorants used in the ibba ( see @xcite ) . in a series of numerical experiments",
