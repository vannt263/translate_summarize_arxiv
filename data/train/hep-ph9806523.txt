    "one problem among those standing beyond the carefully studied standard model of elementary particles @xcite is the determination of an origin for the fermion generations , which possess identical quantum numbers with respect to gauge interactions and differ just in values of masses because of various couplings to the higgs fields @xcite .    at present",
    "there are two approaches to this problem .",
    "according to the former , the fermionic flavors are postulated as charges of a new `` horizontal '' gauge interaction , an observation probability of which is suppressed at current energies due to both small values of these charges and large masses of corresponding intermediate bosons @xcite .    in the letter ,",
    "the appearance of flavors is caused by some dynamical reasons .",
    "the following three ways are usually pointed out @xcite :    \\1 .",
    "dynamical origin of flavors . in the framework of models along this way ,",
    "fermions and higgs fields are considered as composite states of fundamental `` preons '' , so that the generations differ because of an internal preonic structure @xcite .",
    "\\2 . random lattice model of space and gauge interactions @xcite . in such models",
    "the flavors appear as effective low - energy fields caused by some nontrivial random interactions on the lattice in a deep region of the plank scale .",
    "geometric origin of generations : the superstring models with a compactification of an extended - dimensions space @xcite . in this way",
    "the flavors naturally appear due to an appropriate choice of compactified manifold @xcite .    a common point of the mentioned ways is an essential extension for a set of fundamental fields with respect to the standard model . a replication of higgs fields alike the number of generations seems to be a usual peculiarity of such extensions",
    ".    in the present paper",
    "we show how a model of potential for three higgs fields can be constructed in a manner which results in an appearance of vacuum state possessing a discrete symmetry for higgses at spontaneous breaking of chiral gauge symmetry , so that the discrete symmetry provides the introduction of three generations of fermions .",
    "the advantage of such picture of generations is the absence of direct postulation of `` preons '' , random lattice dynamics or superstring compactifications .",
    "therefore , the offered model can be considered as quite a self - consistent description for the introduction of fermion generations . on the other hand , in the framework of mentioned ways for the construction of fermion flavors",
    ", the model can be taken as a common low - energy limit for three effective higgses interacting with the fermion field .",
    "the higgs potential under consideration possesses a discrete symmetry of three vacuum configurations which are determined by a minimum of energy for constant fields . in accordance with transformations of this symmetry",
    ", a state of the minimum can be obtained from another by a discrete change of complex phases for the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of higgses .",
    "these transformations are the representation of discrete group @xmath0 , whereas the higgs fields have the charges @xmath1 .",
    "the physical vacuum invariant by the action of discrete group can be constructed as a direct product of minimal energy states for the higgses .",
    "then , the fermionic fields over each of the three minima have different mass values along with the identical properties with respect to the gauge interaction , which means the introduction of three generations of fermions . in a matrix representation of the direct product for the vacuum configurations of higgses , the mass matrix of fermions",
    "has a symmetric texture determined by the discrete group .",
    "for the presence of charged currents the representation of mass matrix can be fixed by the set of physical parameters in the model : the products of higgs vev by three yukawa coupling constants for fermions , whereas the only coupling constant is a complex one .",
    "the necessary condition for the fixing of the mass matrix is the introduction of complex phase causing the violation of cp - invariance .",
    "in real situation , when the fermion masses of major generation are much greater than the masses of the junior ones , the relation of elements for the matrix of charged current mixing @xcite with the physical parameters of model is significantly simplified , so that up to small corrections over the mass ratios of generations one can determine the phase of cp - violation , and the values of mixing angles are expressed through the mass ratios in the parameterization recently introduced by fritzsch and xing @xcite and also discussed in @xcite .    to clarify both the presentation of method used for the construction of model and its physical meaning , we consider the potential for two higgses with the discrete @xmath2-symmetry of vacuum configurations in section 1 .",
    "so , the fermion field has two generations , and the mixing matrix of charged currents is determined by the only parameter , the cabibbo angle , which is expressed in the known way of `` see - saw '' kind @xcite . the potential model with three higgses",
    "is constructed in section 2 .",
    "the vacuum is symmetric over the transformations of discrete cyclic group of the third order .",
    "this symmetry provides the introduction of three generations for the fermions .",
    "relations for the elements of charged - current mixing matrix with the model parameters are derived .",
    "numerical estimates for the former ones are performed with the use of current experimental data on the fermion masses and cabibbo  kobayashi  maskawa matrix .",
    "the obtained results are summarized in the conclusion .",
    "consider a chiral interaction of dirac spinor with an abelian gauge field @xmath3 and a higgs @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the lagrangian of free gauge field with a possible introduction of both a term fixing the gauge and a corresponding lagrangian for faddeev  popov ghosts , @xmath7 is the higgs lagrangian with a self - action and the gauge interaction , @xmath8 is the yukawa constant which can be taken real and positive because of an arbitrary definition of complex phases for the higgs field and the product of spinors in the vertex of their interaction . at the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry",
    "the vacuum expectation value of higgs is not equal to zero @xmath9 in the unitary gauge @xmath10 , the fermion gets the mass @xmath11 @xmath12 in an arbitrary gauge , it is convenient to use the method of auxiliary fields , so that , for instance , @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 by the way , the kinetic term of lagrangian and the gauge interaction of @xmath16 with the field @xmath17 do not change . thus , one can see from ( [ f6 ] ) , that the field has the mass @xmath11 , as one must expect from the unitary gauge in ( [ f3 ] ) .",
    "now consider the analogous interaction of fermions with two higgses @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "for the latter ones at the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry , the vacuum expectation values are equal to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is an arbitrary gauge parameter , @xmath22 is the difference between the phases of vev , so that this difference can be observable .",
    "it is quite evident that the complex phase leads to the fermion mass depending on @xmath22 @xmath23    the following situation is of special interest : the phase difference @xmath22 is constrained due to a form of higgs self - action , so that the vacuum minimum of potential takes place at some discrete values of @xmath22 .    in the model under consideration , the higgs potential has the form @xmath24 ^ 2 , \\label{v}\\ ] ] where all of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are greater than zero , so that the constraint of the potential stability ( @xmath27 at infinity ) gives @xmath28 .",
    "then , the equations for the energy minimum @xmath29 result in the vev equal to @xmath30 then , the minimal energy can be written down in the form @xmath31 therefore , in the vacuum state one has @xmath32 ( see figs.1 and 2 ) .",
    "thus , in the specified model of higgs self - action , the phase difference between the vacuum expectations runs over the discrete values @xmath33 it is convenient to use the representation for the cyclic group of second order @xmath2 , wherein the fields @xmath34 have the charges @xmath35 , correspondingly , and the group elements , the relative phases @xmath36 , are the integer powers of basis @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the configurations with the various relative phases of vev can be obtained by the transformations of discrete group .",
    "r9 cm +    then , introducing fields ( [ f4 ] ) , one gets @xmath38 and at fixed @xmath22 ( [ f12 ] ) the real matrix @xmath39 has the eigenvalues corresponding to the fermion masses @xmath40 further , introducing @xmath41 one gets the diagonal form of the mass matrix @xmath42 with the eigen - vectors @xmath43 .",
    "let us emphasize that , first , the introduced auxiliary fields have the particular form @xmath44 at @xmath45 , so that acting on the minimal energy configuration @xmath46 , the field @xmath47 results in the state with the mass @xmath48 .",
    "second , one obtains @xmath49 at @xmath50 , so that the @xmath51 field has the mass @xmath52 over the configuration @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , if one constructs the model vacuum as @xmath54 then one can use two kinds of auxiliary fields at @xmath10 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , having the mentioned particular form  and the common mass - matrix independent of the chosen values of @xmath22 , to introduce the common physical field with the components corresponding to the kind of generation .",
    "so , the extended lagrangian contains the physical field @xmath16 over the vacuum @xmath57 with two generations .",
    "note that the vacuum conserves the discrete symmetry of the second - order cyclic group , which does provide the introduction of fermionic generations in the given model .",
    "r9 cm    the structure of the higgs fields vacuum can not change the number of fermionic degrees of freedom , so , it can not be the origin of generations , since it can not produce these fermion fields .",
    "two generations are introduced by construction .",
    "however , the considered model of higgs vacuum certainly provides the introduction of two generations : the higgs vacuum is arranged for the introduction of two generations of fermions .",
    "so , the number of fermionic degrees of freedom is not changed in an original lagrangian , since it is introduced in the self - consistent way .",
    "it is correct that in a gauge theory the only possible vacuum configuration can be chosen because the physical meaning of gauge invariance is the equivalence of those configurations : the physics in each configuration is the same , and the only configuration must be chosen , the others are produced by the gauge transformations .",
    "so , the physical principle for the restriction by the only configuration is the gauge invariance .",
    "however , that is not the case with the model under consideration .",
    "the constructed configurations of minimal energy are not gauge equivalent , since they distinguish by the phase difference which is the observable physical quantity .",
    "therefore , the full vacuum of the theory must contain all of the configurations because there is no physical principle ( `` a rule of super - selection '' ) to cancel some configuration and to restrict the state .",
    "so , the paper describes the theory , where all of the configurations are symmetrically presented in the vacuum .",
    "the minimal energy of potential is symmetric , but the quantum numbers , which are the gauge independent differences between the vev phases , are changed under the action of discrete group . hence , this symmetry can not be broken spontaneously , since the latter results in forbidding of some values for the quantum numbers , with no physical reasons .",
    "the vacuum expectation values are equal to @xmath58 which is the matrix due to the vacuum definition .",
    "so , the higgs vev , which is a simple classic field , converts to the matrix with the classic elements .",
    "one can simply recognize that the same representation can be equivalently obtained by the following construction :    1 ) . introduce the replication of higgs sector for each generation , i.e. introduce the matrix for each higgs field @xmath59    2 ) .",
    "construct the new vacuum as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the single chosen vacuum configuration for the first generation with its own higgs sector , and @xmath62 is the single vacuum configuration for the second generation with its higgs sector , respectively .",
    "then , the higgs vev is the same matrix @xmath63 thus , this construction clarifies the situation in the usual way .",
    "the author prefers for the complex definition of the vacuum , when it carries an internal structure , than the replication of higgs sector and , hence , the undesirable breaking of discrete symmetry in each isolated sector , together with the additional observable scalar particles . the first economic way is more attractive to me , but the second one is more evident , simple , usual and clear .    in the matrix representation of vacuum state",
    ", there is the permutation symmetry for the vacuum configurations , which is related to the discrete group .",
    "these permutations contain two elements : @xmath64 which correspond to the arbitrary arrangement of generations : whether one puts the first generation to be light or heavy , so that in the initial representation these permutations result in the substitutions @xmath65 in the mass matrix of ( [ f11 ] ) .",
    "thus , two species of fermions possessing the identical properties with respect to the gauge interaction and different mass values , are introduced because of two kinds of vacuum configurations for the pair of higgses , so that in the model under consideration , the effect of introduction of two generations is provided by the vacuum structure of higgs fields .    from the practical point of view ,",
    "equation ( [ f13 ] ) shows that the large splitting of fermion masses for two generations ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) can be caused by no difference between the values of yukawa constants for the interaction between the fermions and higgses .",
    "the mass difference can be the result of small splitting between the vacuum expectation values , one finds that @xmath68 , so that , probably , the splitting is of the order of radiative corrections . ]  ( at @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) @xmath71    thus , we have shown that at the spontaneous breaking of gauge symmetry the structure of vacuum for the pair of higgs fields interacting with the fermions can provide the introduction of two generations of fermions as two kinds of the relation with the vacuum symmetric over the discrete group .",
    "the introduction of auxiliary fields ( [ f4 ] ) with the symmetric mass - matrix at @xmath72 contains the uncertainty related to an additional term @xmath73 which does not contribute to the determination of the mass values , since it is canceled in the lagrangian expressed through the initial single - generation fields .",
    "this uncertainty corresponds to the rotation of the introduced physical fields in the lagrangian with two generations .",
    "so , considering the general form of extended lagrangian with different yukawa constants @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the higgs fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 , one gets the following expression for the mass matrix and fields @xmath76 , is equal to @xmath77 , so that for @xmath78 , we have the situation , when @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are real and positive . ]  : @xmath81 where @xmath82 , so that the eigenvalues of the matrix are the same @xmath83 , which are independent of the @xmath84 value .",
    "however , there is a particular state , when @xmath84 is determined by the physical quantities of model .",
    "so , we find .",
    "a description of the inverse condition is quite evident after a suitable transformation of @xmath85 . ]",
    "@xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 the @xmath84 value is related to the masses of fermions @xmath90 the matrix gets the `` see - saw '' form in the `` heavy '' basis @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is defined in eq.([u ] ) . at @xmath93",
    "we have @xmath94 , and the mass matrix of ( [ mv ] ) is a `` democratic '' one @xcite .",
    "next , the model matrix of ( [ mv2 ] ) takes the diagonal form after the action by the rotation to the angle @xmath84 .",
    "let us consider now the model with two kinds of the chiral fields @xmath95 and @xmath96 possessing different charges , so that the charged current interaction between the latter ones has the form @xmath97 where the initial mass - matrices have the form of ( [ mv ] ) with @xmath98 then , the cabibbo mixing matrix has the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 . at @xmath101 ,",
    "one gets the cabibbo angle @xmath102 thus , the offered model provides the introduction of two generations due to the structure of vacuum for two higgs fields .",
    "it describes also the mixing matrix of charged currents through the physical quantities , which allows one to relate the mixing angle with the masses of fermions .",
    "constructing the model in this section , we will follow the scheme presented above in the case of two generations .",
    "consider the potential of three higgses @xmath103- \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{8}[h_1^ * h_2+h_2^ * h_1+h_1^ * h_3+h_3^ * h_1 + h_2^ * h_3+h_3^ * h_2- \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\frac{k}{2}(h_1^ * h_1+h_2^ * h_2+h_3^ * h_3)]^2 . \\label{v3g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as it has been mentioned in the previous section , the relative phases in the sum of pair products of three higgses in the expression for their potential can be removed by the redefinitions of fields so that there are no additional complex phases in the second string of ( [ v3 g ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the contact terms of higgs interaction with the fermion field one can make two quantities of three yukawa constants to be positive by the same procedure .",
    "so , there is the only complex parameter , a single yukawa constant .",
    "the vacuum configuration corresponds to constant fields determined by five parameters : three absolute values of vev @xmath104 and two phase differences between them , @xmath105 $ ] . putting the first derivatives of potential over these quantities to be equal to zero , we find @xmath106 from the condition @xmath107 .",
    "further , the derivatives over the phase differences give @xmath108 for nonzero values of @xmath104 .",
    "a consideration of @xmath109 can be easily performed , so that we study the configuration , wherein the latter ones are excluded .",
    "then , we get @xmath110 in the rest of paper we use the following set of potential parameters @xmath111 which leads to @xmath112 where we have taken into account the condition @xmath113 . for the chosen set of parameters the same absolute values of both vev and minimal energy are reached at @xmath114 , too .",
    "thus , in the described model of potential for three higgs fields the vacuum configuration corresponds to three possible sets of phase differences : @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "the fact means that the model vacuum is symmetric over the action of third - order cyclic group @xmath0 , whereas the fields @xmath117 possess the charges @xmath118 , correspondingly . as it was in the case of two generations , it is convenient to use the matrix representation for the vacuum state defined as the direct product of three given configurations of minimal energy @xmath119 where we have already chosen the single vacuum configuration for the each sector of higgses , so that the same matrix of vev is reproduced , when we take the model with @xmath57 .",
    "acting on each element of vacuum @xmath57 , the fermionic operator produces the field with different masses : three configurations lead to three values of masses .",
    "thus , the discrete symmetry of vacuum provides the introduction of three generations of fermionic field .    in the lagrangian for the interaction of higgses with the fermion field @xmath120",
    "we will suppose that @xmath121 , and @xmath122 introduce the notations @xmath123 and @xmath124 then the masses of generations are determined by the expressions @xmath125 construct the auxiliary fields @xmath126 then the lagrangian of ( [ lm ] ) can be written down in terms of fields ( [ a3 ] ) with the use of mass matrix @xmath127 in the considered model of potential the admissible set of phase differences results in the mass matrix , which does not depend on the choice of vacuum configuration @xmath128 in a general case , matrix ( [ m3 ] ) is not hermitian because of the complex value of @xmath129 .",
    "it possesses the permutation symmetry over the indices of higgses in the way that its eigenvalues do not change through these permutations .",
    "the elements of the permutation group are given by the matrices @xmath130 the mass matrix can be diagonalized by the action of unitary matrices @xmath131 where @xmath132 , so that @xmath133 where @xmath134 , @xmath135 further , note that the unitary matrices @xmath136 diagonalizing @xmath137 , are constructed from the corresponding vectors , which are given by the auxiliary fields of ( [ a3 ] ) at three fixed phase differences of higgs vev .",
    "the fact means that , as it was in the model with two generations , each configuration of auxiliary field in the diagonal representation corresponds to the only generation , exactly , i.e. the only element of vector is not equal to zero .",
    "thus , we can introduce the physical field @xmath16 , whose components correspond to the generations of fermion field , with the common mass - matrix of ( [ m3 ] ) .      having considered the example of two fermionic generations , we see that the initial mass - matrix for the auxiliary fields contains the uncertainty , which does not change the values of masses and can be related to the rotations of components for the extended physical field . for three generations , a displacement of relative phase between the generations is added to the rotations . the rotation angles and the complex phase can not be any external additional parameters of the model , and they have to be related to the physical quantities : @xmath138 .",
    "so , the transformation parameters can be determined due to a fixing of a symmetric form of the mass matrix . for the system of two generations ,",
    "the symmetry condition for the @xmath139 matrix has looked like : @xmath140=m(1,2),\\ ] ] which does not depend on the mentioned permutation symmetry for the components .",
    "the symmetry condition leads to definite relations of the cabibbo angle with the physical parameters of model .",
    "the natural unification of condition to the case of three generations is given by the following equations : @xmath141=m(1,3 ) , \\label{cond}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the resulting matrix has the form @xmath142 it can be constructed in the following way :    permute elements @xmath129 and @xmath143 in matrix ( [ m3 ] ) ( the action of permutation operator @xmath144 ) and come to the `` heavy '' basis by the transformation @xmath145 where @xmath146 so that @xmath147 further , transform this matrix to the form @xmath148 by the action of operators @xmath149 so that @xmath150 .",
    "as one can see , matrix ( [ m - t ] ) has the form similar to one considered above in the case of two generations , so that the third generation is decoupled , and the real part of matrix for two other generations exactly corresponds to the form of matrix constructed above . by the way ,",
    "an imaginary part of matrix for two generations is proportional to the identical one .",
    "then , we can easily introduce the rotation in an analogous way as in the model with two generations , so that @xmath151 and the mass matrix is transformed to @xmath152 where @xmath153 further , make the inverse transformation with matrices @xmath154 to get the previous texture of imaginary parts for the elements of mass matrix : @xmath155 .",
    "then , introduce both the angle of mixing with the third ( heavy ) generation and the relative phase @xmath156 whereas @xmath157 in what follows we will use the approximation of low @xmath158 value in the linear order over this angle .",
    "finally , coming from the `` heavy '' basis to the `` democratic '' one , we find the mass matrix @xmath159 @xmath160 making conditions ( [ cond ] ) to be valid , we get that the mass matrix takes form ( [ m - cond ] ) , if the following equations are satisfied @xmath161 constructing a realistic model , we have to use the condition of observed low values of masses for the junior generations with respect to the mass of major generation as well as the fact that the mixing between two junior generations is quite accurately described by the scheme considered in the model of two generations .",
    "so , in the realistic model we suppose @xmath162 then we can easily find @xmath163 first of all , note that at small angles of generation mixing , the introduction of complex phase @xmath164 is necessary , whereas the value of @xmath165 in the leading approximation is certainly fixed",
    ". however , we have to point out such uncertainties as signs of @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and , hence , signs of some masses and rotation angles .",
    "therefore , the order of arrangement for the first and second generations is not definite in the diagonal representation , since the relative sign of @xmath167 and @xmath169 is uncertain .",
    "the phenomenological analysis shows that the angle @xmath158 corresponds to the mixing between the second generation and the third one .",
    "now consider the picture of mixing for the charged currents of left - handed fermions , @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "one can easily understand that the unitary matrix of cabibbo  kobayashi  maskawa is given by the expression ) does not influence the cabibbo matrix because this transformation is the rotation to the angle @xmath170 , which is compensated by the inverse rotation for the quarks of other charge . in the model with three generations",
    ", the presence of mixing with the third heavy generation leads to the fact that to remove the additional rotation to the angle @xmath170 , we have correspondingly to transform the mass matrix : to come to the `` heavy '' basis , to make the inverse rotations by matrix @xmath171 and operators @xmath154 , to rotate the matrix of two light generations by ( [ u ] ) , and , finally , to be back to the initial texture ( operators @xmath154 , @xmath171 and the rotation from the `` heavy '' basis to the `` democratic '' one ( [ us ] ) ) . by the procedure , the mentioned properties of symmetry for the mass matrix naturally survive in a changed form . ] @xmath172 the complex phases in the matrices @xmath171 for the `` up '' kind and `` down '' kind fermions do not cancel each other , if @xmath173 . for the mixing angles of junior generations @xmath174 with the accuracy up to the sign",
    ", we approximately get @xmath175 thus , the mixing matrix @xmath176 in the representation of fritzsch  xing has the form @xmath177 where @xmath178 , and analogous definitions are made for the sines , and @xmath179 the features of such representation of the mixing matrix for the charged currents are in detail discussed in papers by fritzsch and xing .",
    "let us here note only that with the accuracy up to small corrections over the mass ratios for the fermion generations , we have @xmath180      consider the matrix of charged current mixing for quarks .",
    "this matrix is of special interest phenomenologically , since the measurement of its elements is carried out experimentally in the framework of precision study of the standard model , but also theoretically because , in contrast to lots of models introducing the various initial mass - matrices of the fermion generations , the model under consideration can make some definite predictions on both the phase of cp - violation ( [ cp2 ] ) and the relation of angle @xmath84 with the masses of quarks .    indeed , with the accuracy up to small corrections linear over the ratios of generation masses , we find @xmath181 for the cabibbo angle , we get @xmath182 where the upper sign corresponds to the negative value of relative sign between @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "further , @xmath185 in the @xmath186-meson physics , angles of unitary triangle are usually introduced .",
    "so , in the given model we can predict , for example , @xmath187 $ ] , which approximately coincides with the angle @xmath188 up to high accuracy , @xmath189 for @xmath190 $ ] , we obtain @xmath191 \\approx \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{39}}{4}\\ ; \\sqrt{\\frac{m_u m_s}{m_d m_c } } \\bigg[1\\mp\\frac{5}{8}\\sqrt{\\frac{m_u m_s}{m_d m_c}}\\bigg].\\ ] ] the universal parameter @xmath192 @xcite independent of the representation for the mixing matrix of charged currents determines the violation of cp - invariance . in the model it is given by the expression",
    "@xmath193 choosing the negative sign in the expressions for the cabibbo angle and element @xmath194 and supposing that - quark mass and some uncertainties in the initial data of the evolution .",
    "so , the set supposed in ( [ maset ] ) is generally used for the illustrative purpose though it is quite typical . ]",
    "@xmath195 we find ( @xmath196 ) and elements of mixing matrix .",
    "we have also to point out that the choice of quark masses close to the values in the paper by lucas & raby @xcite leads to the quark - currents mixing matrix approximately equal to what is obtained in the model under consideration . ]",
    "that @xmath197 and the set of values shown in table [ vckm ] for the elements of cabibbo  kobayashi  maskawa matrix .",
    ".the model predictions with the mass set of ( 67 ) in comparison with the current experimental data . [ cols=\"^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ vckm ]    thus , we have shown that in the framework of model the numerical estimates of matrix elements for the mixing of charged quark currents agree with the current experimental data within the accuracy of determination , but also they have a predictive power with respect to the parameters of cp - violation .",
    "in this paper we have constructed the models of potentials for two and three higgses , wherein there are the discrete symmetries of vacuum configurations , @xmath2 and @xmath0 , correspondingly , which provides the introduction of two and three generations of fermions coupled to the higgses by the yukawa interaction .",
    "thus , the essential reason for the generation replication is in part the symmetric structure of higgs vacuum .    in the framework of such approach ,",
    "the hierarchy of generation masses ( two generations are light and the only one is heavy ) is caused by a small splitting of the quantities defined by the products of vacuum expectation values of higgses and yukawa coupling constants in the higgs - fermion contact terms .",
    "these physical parameters of model determine the matrix of charged current mixing , whose elements are related to the ratios of generation masses . in the leading approximation for the quark currents mixing , the hierarchy of masses results in the certain predictions on the complex phase of cp - violation and several elements of the matrix , though there is the uncertainty in the choice of several signs because of indefinite values for the model parameters : the arrangement of yukawa constants and vacuum expectation values .",
    "we have shown that the typical set of quark masses leads to the cabibbo ",
