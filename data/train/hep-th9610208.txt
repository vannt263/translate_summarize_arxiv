    "<S> 30 - 059 cracow , poland +    tpju-21/96 october 1996 hep - th/9610208    calculation of the qcd prediction for the intercept of the odderon trajectory still remains a challenge for the leading logarithmic scheme of the reggeization of qcd @xcite . in the first approximation the problem naturally separates into sectors with fixed number @xmath0 of the reggeized gluons propagating in the @xmath1 channel . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest nontrivial case , @xmath2 , was solved in the classical papers by balitskii , kuraev , fadin and lipatov @xcite resulting in the simple expression for the intercept of the hard pomeron . </S>",
    "<S> the notable progress for arbitrary @xmath0 was achieved by lipatov and faddeev and korchemsky @xcite who have established exact equivalence with the one dimensional chain of @xmath0 noncompact spins . </S>",
    "<S> leading high energy behaviour of qcd amplitudes is given by the highest eigenvalue of the corresponding heisenberg hamiltonian of @xmath0 spins with nearest neighbour interaction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by identifying enough constants of motion they were able to prove that this system is soluble for arbitrary @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the success of this , rather mathematical , approach was confirmed by rederiving the lipatov et al . </S>",
    "<S> result in the @xmath2 case @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the adopted procedure requires an analytic continuation from the integer values of the relevant conformal weight @xmath3 ( see later ) because only for integer @xmath3 they were able to diagonalize the two spin hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 case , which gives the lowest contribution to the odderon exchange , was also studied by faddeev and korchemsky , and korchemsky @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again , the spectrum of the system for integer @xmath3 can be found for any finite @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the general expression for arbitrary @xmath6 is not known , and consequently the analytical continuation to @xmath7 is not available . </S>",
    "<S> hamiltonian is believed to occur at @xmath7 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a new approach which a ) works for arbitrary values of the conformal weight @xmath3 , providing explicitly above continuation , and b ) gives the analytic solution of the @xmath4 case for arbitrary @xmath3 and @xmath8 . for @xmath2 our method reproduces again the @xmath9 result clarifying the problem of boundary conditions for arbitrary @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this and the details of the @xmath4 calculation will be presented elsewhere @xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we address directly the odderon case and discuss some phenomenological consequences .    </S>",
    "<S> the intercept of the odderon trajectory is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the largest eigenvalues of the @xmath4 reggeon hamiltonian and its antiholomorphic counterpart @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this system is equivalent to the one dimensional chain of three noncompact spins with nearest - neighbour interactions . applying bethe ansatz to the latter one obtains @xmath13 where @xmath14 satisfies the following baxter equation @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath8 are the eigenvalues of the two , commuting with the hamiltonian , operators which play important role in the proof of the solubility of the above system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of @xmath17 is known from the symmetry considerations @xmath18 the eigenvalues of @xmath19 are known only for integer conformal weights @xmath3 , whereas the value of @xmath8 for the ground state of the three reggeized gluons @xmath20 is not available . </S>",
    "<S> analogous expressions hold for the antiholomorphic sector with @xmath21 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal is to determine @xmath22 for arbitrary @xmath3 and @xmath8 . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the trick of ref.@xcite and seek the solution of the baxter equation ( [ bax ] ) in the form of the _ </S>",
    "<S> double _ contour representation @xmath23 provided the boundary contributions cancel , eq.([bax ] ) is equivalent to the following ordinary differential equation for @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 q(z)=0 . \\label{diff}\\ ] ] this is a third order linear equation of the fuchs class with the three regular singular points at @xmath28 and @xmath29 , considered earlier in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite,@xcite,@xcite we will prove that the complete boundary conditions on @xmath24 and @xmath25 are _ uniquely _ determined by the requirement of the cancellation of the boundary terms among the integrals ( [ con ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the distinctive feature of the @xmath4 case which allows for the successful application of our strategy .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the construction of the two fundamental sets of three , linearly independent solutions @xmath30 around @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 where the coefficients of the expansions are determined by the recursion relations easily obtained from eq.([diff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 and for the logarithmic solutions @xmath35 the series in eq.([uba ] ) are convergent in the unit circle @xmath36 around @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> . similarly one can construct the @xmath37 solutions in the unit circle @xmath38 around @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , because of the symmetry of the eq.([diff ] ) we take @xmath39 since any solution is the linear combination of the fundamental solutions , we have @xmath40 with an obvious vector notation . </S>",
    "<S> the transition matrix @xmath41 is defined by @xmath42 and plays an important role in the following . </S>",
    "<S> it provides the analytic continuation of our solutions @xmath43 between @xmath36 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> transition matrix @xmath41 can be easily determined from eq.([trans ] ) once both bases , eqs.([uba],[vba ] ) , are known . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the i - th row , @xmath44 , of @xmath41 can be obtained as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are arbitrary three points inside the intersection of @xmath36 and @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> next we introduce the monodromy matrix @xmath48 which describes the behaviour of the basis @xmath49 in the vicinity of the branch point @xmath31 ( see fig.1 ) @xmath50    we are now ready to write the condition for the cancellation of the boundary contributions in eq.([con ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us choose the contours @xmath51 and @xmath52 as shown in fig.2 . then , the boundary contributions cancel if @xmath53 where the combined monodromy matrices for the corresponding contours read @xmath54 hence the original freedom of six coefficients in eqs.([abf ] ) was reduced to the three free parameters which we conveniently choose as @xmath55 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this was expected . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the n=3 case additional simplification occurs which , remarkably , allows to fix completely the remaining freedom .    </S>",
    "<S> the key point is the observation that the monodromy matrices ( [ com ] ) are singular , i.e. @xmath57 . to see this </S>",
    "<S> it is enough to inspect the riemann p symbol corresponding to eq.([diff ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath58 it is readily seen that , contrary to the n=2 case , there exists a solution which is _ regular _ at @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the reduced monodromy matrices @xmath60 and @xmath61 must have the zero eigenvalue corresponding to this solution . as a consequence , eqs.([canc ] ) </S>",
    "<S> do not have the unique solution for ( a, ... ,f ) . </S>",
    "<S> different choices of coefficients differ by the zero mode . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is inessential because the integrals of the solution , regular at infinity , vanish . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore proceed to isolate the zero mode explicitly , and then impose the condition of cancellation of boundary contributions . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we introduce the new basis @xmath62 such that @xmath63 is the solution regular at @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> transformation matrix @xmath64 , @xmath65 , to the @xmath62 basis can be readily obtained by diagonalizing the commuting matrices @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the new basis ( marked by the subscript @xmath1 ) the cancellation condition reads @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are diagonal with one ( third , say ) zero eigenvalue , @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the monodromy matrix in the new basis . </S>",
    "<S> our final conclusions follow now trivially from eq.([cann ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> coefficients @xmath73 and @xmath74 are arbitrary ( and irrelevant ) , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are determined uniquely by @xmath77 and @xmath78 provided the _ additional consistency condition _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath79 is satisfied , @xmath80 being the matrix elements of @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the last condition fixes completely the remaining freedom . </S>",
    "<S> now the integral transforms @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( hence also the solution of the baxter equation @xmath82 are determined uniquely up to an irrelevant normalization . </S>",
    "<S> this ends our proof .    </S>",
    "<S> now the contour integrals and derivatives over @xmath83 can be done analytically since @xmath51 and @xmath52 lay within the corresponding domains of convergence of all involved series . </S>",
    "<S> basis on @xmath84 . ] integrating resulting expressions term by term must be made @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ] we have obtained the final formula for @xmath22 in the form of absolutely convergent series for arbitrary values of the conformal weight @xmath3 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> resulting expression is rather lengthy and will not be quoted here , however it provides , for the first time , the energy of the three reggeon hamiltonian as the analytic function of the relevant parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> we will now discuss some special cases and phenomenological consequences of our result . </S>",
    "<S> first , for integer @xmath5 there exists a discrete set of quantized values of @xmath85 for which the polynomial solution @xmath86 exists . </S>",
    "<S> this quantization of @xmath8 is known and the eigenenergies @xmath87 at these points can be calculated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we quote the first few levels in table 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> .quantization of @xmath8 and first few levels of the holomorphic hamiltonian in the polynomial case . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our formula reproduces these results exactly . </S>",
    "<S> the whole procedure can be followed in the polynomial case and it can be shown that the known spectrum emerges . </S>",
    "<S> two particular cases are shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3a and 3b . in fig.3a </S>",
    "<S> we plot @xmath88 around @xmath89 , and in fig.3b @xmath90 is shown in the region of @xmath8 which contains both positive eigenvalues @xmath91 listed in table i. all levels of @xmath11 ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> table i ) are reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> second , our expression agrees with the asymptotic formula derived in ref.@xcite . in the limit @xmath92 </S>",
    "<S> , korchemsky has derived a simple expression @xmath93 ,          \\label{asym}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 are three roots of the polynomial @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c shows comparison of this asymptotic form with our exact formula for @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> agreement is very striking indeed and persists to @xmath3 as low as @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , it turns out that the expression ( [ asym ] ) contains many terms which are nonleading in the above limit . </S>",
    "<S> retaining consistently the terms up to a given order in @xmath98 , as was also done in ref.@xcite , gives yet simpler result which however does not work so well . </S>",
    "<S> also the analytic structure of @xmath22 is reasonably well reproduced by eq.([asym ] ) while the rigorous expansion in @xmath98 fails here ( see later ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss phenomenological consequences and relation with other works . </S>",
    "<S> since the lowest state of the three reggeized gluons is expected to occur at @xmath7 , we have mapped numerically the analytic structure of @xmath99 in the complex @xmath8 plane . </S>",
    "<S> results are sketched in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> the holomorphic energy @xmath99 has a series of simple poles on the imaginary axis , and behaves regularly in the remaining part of the @xmath8 plane . </S>",
    "<S> in fact re @xmath99 is negative almost in the whole @xmath8 plane except of the small regions in the vicinity of above poles . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the approximate solution , eq.([asym ] ) , has the same singularity structure with similar location of poles . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that there may exist a better , than @xmath98 expansion , approximation scheme in which eq.([asym ] ) is the lowest order . </S>",
    "<S> because of eq.([inter ] ) and the symmetry @xmath100 , the intercept of the odderon trajectory is smaller than @xmath101 for most values of @xmath8 . in particular , @xmath102 for all real @xmath8 . at the origin </S>",
    "<S> @xmath103 which indicates that the arguments used in ref.@xcite for the odderon intercept being exactly one , are incomplete . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is caused by the degeneracy of the baxter equations for two and three reggeized gluons when @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> continuity argument indicates that ( [ zero ] ) is the true eigenvalue in the three reggeon sector .    </S>",
    "<S> a variational estimate of the lower bound for the odderon intercept @xmath105 was derived in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> together with present result it limits rather severely the allowed region of @xmath8 for the ground state of the system .    due to the singularity structure </S>",
    "<S> seen above , the final prediction for @xmath106 requires however more detailed knowledge of the spectrum of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> some progress in this area has been reported in refs.@xcite , @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach may be generalized to higher @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a programme would provide the leading intercept of the @xmath0 reggeized gluons as the analytic function of the @xmath107 parameters @xmath108 .    </S>",
