    "he then provides a solution in the case that the observer stands at the origin in the plane and that the centres of the trees are the elements of @xmath10 lying in a disk of integer radius @xmath11 .",
    "allen  @xcite extended this result to the case when the disk has a non  integer radius and kruskal  @xcite dealt with the situation where the trees are centred at non ",
    "zero points of any lattice .",
    "chamizo  @xcite also studied an analogue of this problem in hyperbolic spaces and cusick  @xcite considered the case when the trees have the shape of any given convex body ( cusick relates this case with the lonely runner conjecture  see  @xcite for further developments ) .",
    "g.  plya  @xcite also took an interest in the visibility in a random and periodic forest , a topic related to the distribution of free path lengths in the lorentz gas which is still an active domain of research  see  @xcite and the references therein . on another front",
    ", problems of visibility appear in the context of quasi ",
    "crystals  @xcite and of probabilistic billiards in relation with the study of the behaviour of particles  @xcite .",
    "they are also much studied from an algorithmic point of view and one can therefore find a wealth of literature dealing with them in computer science  see , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "lastly , one should mention that bishop s question finds its origin in a problem of rectifiability of curves .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    let @xmath12 be a fixed integer . define formally a forest @xmath1 in @xmath13 as a collection of points in @xmath13 . given @xmath14 , an @xmath15tree in this forest shall refer to a closed ball centred at an element in @xmath1 .",

    "furthermore , no bound is given for the corresponding visibility function .",
    "on the other hand , one may consider a concept weaker than uniform discreteness , namely that of _ finite density_. more precisely , a forest @xmath1 is said to be of finite density if @xmath25 where @xmath26 stands for the cardinality of a subset @xmath27 and where , given @xmath28 , @xmath29 denotes the euclidean ball with radius @xmath30 centred at @xmath31 ( being of finite density is that of @xmath1 being discrete . ] ) . clearly , a uniformly discrete dense forest has a finite density . using dirichlet s theorem in diophantine approximation ,",

    "it should be noted that the visibility problem under consideration is closely related to the danzer problem , which asks for the existence in @xmath13 of a set of finite density intersecting any convex body of volume one .",
    "clearly , such a set is in particular a dense forest with visibility function @xmath41 . as the danzer problem is still open",
    ", one may consider to weaken the conditions therein in two directions .",
    "on the one hand , one may relax the density constraint .",
    "thus , y.  solomon and b.  weiss  @xcite showed that there exists a set @xmath42 intersecting any convex body with volume one such that @xmath43 . on the other hand ,",
    "one may require less restrictive conditions for the convex bodies under consideration . while john s theorem ( @xcite , see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  5.4 ) ) shows that one obtains essentially an equivalent problem when limiting oneself to the subset of boxes in @xmath13 , one may relax the volume constraint for these boxes is the image under an orthogonal transformation of an aligned hyperrectangle of the form @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 . ] . for obvious reasons ,",
    "the constructions of dense forests are in this vein . in this respect",
