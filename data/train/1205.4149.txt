    "proximity effects occurring at the interface of superconducting and ferromagnetic phases have attracted considerable attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "extensive theoretical work has been exerted to understand the nature of these mixed states . for weak ferromagnets , with curie temperatures below @xmath6",
    "k a transition of the homogeneous f layer into a non - homogeneous domain - like ( `` cryptoferromagnetic '' ) phase is predicted @xcite , @xcite , @xcite with domain sizes less than the coherence length of the superconductor .",
    "conventional 3d ferromagnets , like fe , co and ni , exhibit curie temperatures above 300 k. in order to study s / f proximity effects with a weak ferromagnet , a control of the curie temperature of the f layer is required . in this work",
    "we use the dilution of a conventional ferromagnetic material with non - magnetic atoms , namely nickel with copper .",
    "ni and cu are fully miscible in the bulk @xcite with almost linear dependence of the curie temperature ( and , hence , the exchange coupling strength ) on the ni concentration @xcite .",
    "in addition to the concentration dependence of the curie temperature , the dependence on the thickness of thin f layer was reported in several works , e.g. @xmath7 for nb / gd structures @xcite .",
    "a linear dependence on @xmath8 was observed for small @xmath8-s , then it is saturated for larger gd thicknesses , a phenomenon , which was ascribed to the finite - size effects @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the @xmath9 was studied in thin ni and ni@xmath10cu@xmath11 layers being in contact with a nb layer , and only a linear thickness dependence was observed .",
    "here we study the magnetic properties of ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 films ( @xmath12 and 65 and @xmath0 = [ 3 nm @xmath5 12 nm ] ) being in contact with a 80 nm thick vanadium layer .",
    "these systems were prepared to reveal proximity effects between the superconducting vanadium and the ferromagnetic ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 and study their dependence on the exchange coupling strength of the f layer by means of polarized neutron reflectometry . to enhance the contribution of the v / ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 interface to the scattered neutron intensity the v layer was covered with a copper layer to form a neutron waveguide structure @xcite .",
    "we found the curie temperature dependence on the f layer thickness , similarly to @xcite : a linear dependence at small enough thicknesses and a saturation at larger thicknesses .",
    "this behavior is ascribed to a proximity coupling of the v / ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 interface transition region ( `` dead layer '' ) with the rest of the f layer .",
    "although the transition layer is non - magnetic , proximity to the main ( non - mixed ) part of the ferromagnetic layer increasingly suppresses the curie temperature with decreasing the f layer thickness .",
    "samples with a nominal composition of cu(31 nm)/ v(80 nm)/ ni@xmath2cu@xmath3(@xmath0)/ mgo were prepared using molecular beam epitaxy in the wigner research centre for physics ( budapest , hungary ) .",
    "the mgo substrate surface was cleaned by rinsing it in the isopropanol in an ultrasonic cleaner and by heating it to 600 c in ultrahigh vacuum for 30 minutes .",
    "the metallic layers were deposited at room temperature in a base pressure of 5@xmath13 mbar .",
    "all samples were rotated during deposition to increase lateral homogeneity of the films .",
    "mixing of ni and cu was achieved by co - evaporation with deposition rates @xmath14/s and @xmath15/s for @xmath16 and @xmath17/s , @xmath15/s for @xmath18 .",
    "the layer structure of the samples was characterized by neutron reflectometry at angle - dispersive neutron reflectometers gina ( budapest neutron center , hungary ) and nrex ( research reactor frm - ii , garching , germany ) .",
    "the measurements at the gina reflectometer were conducted in @xmath19 oe external field at room temperature in a momentum transfer range of @xmath20 $ ] nm@xmath21 . at room temperature the spin - up and spin - down reflectivities were identical and the sum of reflectograms in the two polarizations was fitted .",
    "a typical neutron reflectivity curve measured on the sample cu(31 nm)/ v(80 nm)/ ni@xmath22cu@xmath23(8.5 nm)/ mgo is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a .",
    "the reflectivity curve is characterized by kiessig oscillations due to the interference on different interfaces .",
    "fit of the data by the program fitsuite @xcite allowed to restore the nuclear scattering length density ( sld ) profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) . from these profiles",
    "the actual thicknesses of f layers were derived ( table 1 ) .",
    "in addition , the analysis of neutron reflectometry data suggests the existence of non - abrupt interface between vanadium and f layers , with a typical thickness between 2 - 5 nm ( see inset in the fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "a set of low - temperature pnr measurements have been performed on the cu(31 nm)/ v(80 nm)/ ni@xmath24cu@xmath25(6 nm)/ mgo sample at the nrex neutron reflectometer .",
    "magnetic field @xmath26 oe was applied parallel to the surface .",
    "spin - up and spin - down reflectivities @xmath27 and @xmath28 were measured in a momentum transfer range of @xmath29 $ ] nm@xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "those reflectivities could also be well described using the sld profiles obtained from the fitting of the room temperature data .            in order to quantify the magnetic moment of the f layer ,",
    "the spin asymmetry [ the normalized difference of the spin - up and spin - down reflectivities ( @xmath27 - @xmath28)/(@xmath27 + @xmath28 ) , fig .  [ fig2]b ] was modeled .",
    "the full line in fig .  [ fig2]b corresponds to the above - described sld profile and a @xmath30 kgs magnetization in the ni@xmath24cu@xmath25 layer , which is slightly higher than the 1.1 kgs measured by rusanov _",
    "@xcite for a similar ni concentration .",
    "the curie temperature of the samples was determined from data collected by the ( quantum design ) squid magnetometer at the wigner research center , budapest .",
    "following a cooling down in zero external magnetic field , the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment of the samples was measured in 10 oe magnetic field applied parallel with the sample surface ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",

    "dependence of the curie temperature on the ni concentration for samples with @xmath31 nm is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] along with data from @xcite .",
    "this dependence is linear and agrees with the behavior of bulk ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 alloys for @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the linear fit to the present data provides @xmath34 k for a ni concentration @xmath35 .",
    "this allows us to conclude that samples with @xmath36 nm behave like the bulk alloy .",
    "however , we observed a dependence of the curie temperature on the f layer thickness ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , similar to the one reported in @xcite for nb / gd structures .",
    "namely , the curie temperature increases with increasing the f layer thickness for samples with @xmath37 nm and then approaches a saturation corresponding to the bulk value . while in @xcite",
    "this behavior was attributed to the manifestation of the finite - size effects , we ascribe the thickness dependence of the curie temperature to the influence of the interface of vanadium and ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 layers .",
    "indeed , neutron reflectometry gives estimation for the thickness of the transition ( t ) layer between vanadium and ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 of the order of @xmath38 2 - 5 nm .",
    "this transition layer , due to its vanadium content is mostly non - magnetic , but proximity to the main part of the f layer ( m ) may lead to an induced magnetization in it . in other words we model the f layer as a proximity - coupled t / m bilayer .",
    "following bergeret _",
    "@xcite we can write the expression for the effective exchange field @xmath39 of the t / m bilayer as , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the exchange field of the bulk ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the densities of states ( dos ) and thicknesses of the main part of the f layer and the transition layer , respectively ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "eq .   is valid provided the thicknesses of m and t layers are smaller than the spin diffusion length , i.e. the spin is conserved in the samples . postulating proportionality between exchange field and the curie temperature we can rewrite as , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the bulk curie temperature for the given concentration @xcite and @xmath47 is the ratio of dos of the t and m layers .",
    ".   can qualitatively explain the thickness dependence of the curie temperature .",
    "indeed , when the thickness of the transition layer is comparable with the total thickness of the f layer the dependence @xmath9 is almost linear .",
    "when the thickness of the f layer is much larger than the thickness of the transition layer , the curie temperature of the layer is close to the bulk value .",
    "fit of the data to the expression provides @xmath48 nm , a value comparable with the thickness of the transition layer estimated from the neutron data , and @xmath32 .",
    "similar values of the non - magnetic transition layer ( or the `` dead layer '' as it is often called in the literature ) for ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 alloys were reported in other experiments like measurements of oscillations of the critical current in s / f / s josephson junctions @xcite or direct measurements of the dos @xcite . since the transition layer is non - magnetic , it does not play a role in the `` oscillating '' superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the presence of a transition layer of the same order of 1 nm was similarly reported for nb / pdni structures @xcite .",
    "the relatively small value @xmath32 indicates that the transition layer exhibits a much smaller dos than the one in the ferromagnetic layer .",
    "such a large decrease in the dos indicate a change in the character of the interface region from a majority @xmath49like to a majority @xmath50like , i.e. to a non - magnetic one .",
    "moreover , interface mixing considerably increases the resistance of the v / ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 interface , similar to what has been reported for nb / ni@xmath10cu@xmath11 structures in @xcite .",
    "indeed , both v and nb represent strong scattering centers in both cu and ni , resulting in specific residual resistivities 5 to 6 times higher than does cu in ni or ni in cu @xcite .",
    "the interface resistance and its relation to the interface transparency in s / weak - f hybrid structures was elaborated in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , thickness and concentration dependencies of the curie temperature of ni@xmath2cu@xmath3 ferromagnetic layer being in contact with a vanadium layer was studied .",
    "the curie temperature was found to increase with the thickness of the f layer when the thickness is comparable to that of the mixed v / f interface region and it is saturated at larger thicknesses to the bulk value . the dependence is explained by the proximity coupling of the mixed transition layer with the rest of the f layer .",
    "the present study provides valuable information for fabrication of samples with controlled exchange coupling strength for studies of the superconductor/ ferromagnet proximity effects .",
