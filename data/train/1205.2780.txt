    "one of the most interesting new developments in hadron physics is the application of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite to nonperturbative qcd problems  @xcite .",
    "it is well know that ads / cft gives an important insight into the viscosity and other global properties of the hadronic system formed in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the essential ansatz for the application of ads / cft to hadron physics is the indication that the qcd coupling @xmath1 becomes large .",
    "therefore conformal symmetry can be applied to , for example solutions of the qcd dyson schwinger equations and phenomenological studies of qcd couplings based on physical observables such as @xmath2 decay and the bjorken sum rule show that the qcd @xmath3 function vanishes and @xmath1 become constant at small virtuality ; i.e. , effective charges develop an infrared fixed point . fully exploiting the gauge / gravity correspondence to produce a model for real strong interaction physics- a method called `` holographic qcd '' or `` ads / qcd''-may",
    "be attempted either through a top - dawn approach starting with a particular string theory and choosing a background that naturally produces qcd - like properties , or a bottom - up approach starting with real qcd properties and using them to obtain constraints on viable dual gravity theories .",
    "the first attempts have been made for constructing phenomenological holographic models of qcd  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly simple models consisting of gauge theory in an anti - de - sitter space interval have turned out to provide a remarkably good description of the meson sector of qcd .",
    "therefore , it will be interesting that the calculation of the higher twist effects within holographic qcd in proton - proton collisions in the running coupling approach .",
    "the large - order behavior of a perturbative expansion in gauge theories is inevitably dominated by the factorial growth of renormalon diagrams  @xcite . in the case of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the coefficients of perturbative expansions in the qcd coupling @xmath4 can increase dramatically even at low orders .",
    "this fact , together with the apparent freedom in the choice of renormalization scheme and renormalization scales , limits the predictive power of perturbative calculations , even in applications involving large momentum transfer , where @xmath4 is effectively small .    in this work",
    "we apply the running coupling approach  @xcite in order to compute the effects of the infrared renormalons on the pion production in proton - proton collisions within holographic qcd .",
    "this approach was also employed previously  @xcite to calculate the inclusive meson production in proton - proton and photon - photon collisions .    for the calculations of the higher - twist cross sections on the dependence of wave functions of pion",
    ", we used the holographic qcd prediction @xmath5  @xcite and pion asymptotic wave functions @xmath6",
    "@xcite from the perturbative qcd evolution .",
    "theoretically obtained predicted results within holographic qcd were compared with results of the perturbative qcd which obtained by the running coupling and frozen coupling constants approaches .    the frozen coupling constant approach in refs .",
    "@xcite was used for calculation of integrals , such as @xmath7 it should be noted that , in pqcd calculations , the argument of the qcd coupling constant ( or the renormalization and factorization scale ) @xmath8 should be taken equal to the square of the momentum transfer of a hard gluon in a corresponding feynman diagram . but definition of @xmath9 suffers from infrared singularities .",
    "therefore , in the soft regions as @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , integrals ( 1.1 ) diverge and for their calculation some regularization methods are needed for @xmath12 in these regions .",
    "investigation of the infrared renormalon effects in various inclusive and exclusive processes is one of the most important and interesting problem in the perturbative qcd .",
    "it is known that infrared renormalons are responsible for factorial growth of coefficients in perturbative series for the physical quantities .",
    "but , these divergent series can be resummed by means of the borel transformation  @xcite and the principal value prescription  @xcite .",
    "studies of higher - twist and renormalon effects also opened new prospects for evaluation of power suppressed corrections to processes characteristics .",
    "we organize the paper as the follows . in section [ ht",
    "] , we provide some formulas for the calculation of the contributions of the higher twist and leading twist diagrams . in section [ ir ] ,",
    "we present the formulas and analysis of the higher - twist effects on the dependence of the pion wave function by the running coupling constant approach , and in section [ results ] , the numerical results for the cross section and discuss the dependence of the cross section on the pion wave functions are presented . finally , some concluding remark are stated in section [ conc ] .",
    "the higher - twist feynman diagrams , which describe the subprocess @xmath13 for the pion production in the proton - proton collision are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the amplitude for this subprocess can be found by means of the brodsky - lepage formula  @xcite @xmath14 in eq.(2.1 ) , @xmath15 is the sum of the graphs contributing to the hard - scattering part of the subprocess .    the mandelstam invariant variables for subprocesses @xmath16 are defined as @xmath17 the pion wave functions predicted by ads / qcd  @xcite and the pqcd evolution  @xcite has the form : @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the pion decay constant .",
    "the cross section for the higher - twist subprocess @xmath21 is given by the expression @xmath22",
    "^ 2}{{\\hat s}^3}\\left[\\frac{1}{{\\hat u}^2}+\\frac{1}{{\\hat t}^2}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath23+e_2\\hat u\\int_{0}^{1}dx\\left[\\frac{\\alpha_{s}(q_2 ^ 2)\\phi_{\\pi}(x , q_2 ^ 2)}{1-x}\\right].\\ ] ] in the eq.(2.5 ) @xmath24and @xmath25 represent the momentum squared carried by the hard gluon in fig.1 , @xmath26 is the charge of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the higher - twist contribution to the large-@xmath29 pion production cross section in the process @xmath30 is  @xcite @xmath31 we denote the higher - twist cross section obtained using the frozen coupling constant approach by @xmath32 .    regarding the higher - twist corrections to the pion production cross section , a comparison of our results with leading - twist contributions is crucial .",
    "we take two leading - twist subprocesses for the pion production:(1 ) quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath33 , in which the @xmath34 and ( 2 ) quark - gluon fusion , @xmath35 , with subsequent fragmentation of the final quark into a meson , @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "the main problem in our investigation is the calculation of integral in ( 2.5 ) by the running coupling constant approach within holographic qcd and also discussion of the problem of normalization of the higher twist process cross section in the context of the same approach .",
    "therefore , it is worth noting that , the renormalization scale ( argument of @xmath37 ) according to fig.1 should be chosen equal to @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the integral in eq.(2.5 ) in the framework of the running coupling approach takes the form @xmath40 the @xmath41 has the infrared singularity at @xmath42 , for @xmath43 or @xmath44 , for @xmath45 and so the integral @xmath46 diverges . for the regularization of the integral , we express the running coupling at scaling variable @xmath41 with the aid of the renormalization group equation in terms of the fixed one @xmath12 .",
    "the solution of renormalization group equation for the running coupling @xmath47 has the form  @xcite @xmath48^{-1}.\\ ] ] then , for @xmath49 , we get @xmath50 where @xmath51 .    having inserted eq.(3.3 ) into eq.(2.5 ) we obtain @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "although the integral ( 3.4 ) is still divergent , it is recast into a suitable form for calculation . making the change of variable as @xmath56",
    ", we obtain @xmath57 in order to calculate ( 3.5 ) we will apply the integral representation of @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "@xmath59 gives @xmath60 in the case @xmath61 for the @xmath62 it is written as @xmath63 and for @xmath64 wave function @xmath65 + \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}\\pi f_{\\pi}e_{2}\\hat u}{\\beta_{0 } } \\int_{0}^{\\infty}du e^{-t_{2}u } \\left[\\frac{1}{1-u}-\\frac{1}{2-u}\\right].\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is beta function .",
    "the structure of the infrared renormalon poles in eq.(3.8 ) and eq.(3.9 ) strongly depend on the wave functions of the pion . to remove them from eq.(3.8 ) and eq.(3.9 )",
    "we adopt the principal value prescription .",
    "we denote the higher - twist cross section obtained using the running coupling constant approach by @xmath67 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the higher - twist contributions calculated in the context of the running and frozen coupling constant approaches on the dependence of the chosen pion wave functions in the process @xmath68 . in numerical calculations for the quark distribution function inside the proton , the mstw distribution function  @xcite , and the gluon and quark fragmentation  @xcite functions into a pion have been used .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations are displayed in figs.2 - 14 .",
    "firstly , it is very interesting comparing the higher - twist cross sections obtained within holographic qcd with the ones obtained within perturbative qcd . in fig.2 and fig.3",
    "we show the dependence of higher - twist cross sections @xmath69 , @xmath70 calculated in the context of the frozen and running coupling constant approaches as a function of the pion transverse momentum @xmath29 for different pion wave functions at @xmath71 .",
    "it is seen from fig.2 and fig.3 that the higher - twist cross section is monotonically decreasing with an increase in the transverse momentum of the pion . in fig.4-fig.7",
    ", we show the dependence of the ratios @xmath72/@xmath73 , @xmath67/@xmath69 , @xmath69/@xmath74 and @xmath70/@xmath74 as a function of the pion transverse momentum @xmath29 for @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 pion wave functions . here",
    "@xmath78 is the leading - twist cross section , respectively .",
    "as shown in fig.4 , in the region @xmath79 resummed higher - twist cross section for @xmath75 is suppress by about half orders of magnitude relative to the resummed higher - twist cross section for @xmath76 also higher - twist cross section for @xmath76 is suppress by about half orders of magnitude relative to the higher - twist cross section for @xmath77 . in fig.5 and fig.6 , we show the dependence of the ratios @xmath67/@xmath69 , and @xmath69/@xmath74 as a function of the meson transverse momentum @xmath29 for the @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 pion wave functions .",
    "it is observed from fig.5 that , the ratios for all wave functions decrase with an increase in the transverse momentum of pion , but in the region @xmath80 resummed higher - twist cross section for @xmath75 is suppress by about 2 - 3 and 2 - 4 orders of magnitude relative to the higher - twist cross sections calculated in the context of the frozen coupling method for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively . also , resummed higher - twist cross section for @xmath76 is suppress by about 1 - 3 orders of magnitude relative to the higher - twist cross sections calculated in the context of the frozen coupling method for @xmath77 .",
    "but , as shown in fig.6 , the ratios decrease with increasing in the @xmath29 transverse momentum of the pion and has a minimum approximately at the point @xmath81 , then the ratios increase with increasing in the @xmath29 transverse momentum of the pion . in fig.7",
    "is similar to fig.6 with an exception that there in a minimum approximately at the point @xmath82 . in fig.8 - fig.10",
    ", we have depicted higher - twist cross sections @xmath83 , and ratio @xmath84 , as a function of the rapidity @xmath85 of the pion at @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "figures show that higher - twist cross section and ratios have a different distinctive .",
    "the resummed higher - twist cross section for @xmath75 has a maximum approximately at the point @xmath88 .",
    "however in this point higher - twist cross section for @xmath77 has a minimum . as shown in fig.9 in the region ( @xmath89 ) the ratios",
    "@xmath90 and @xmath91 increase with an increase of the @xmath85 rapidity of the pion and has a maximum approximately at the point @xmath92 , but ratio @xmath93 has a minimum in this point . as is seen from fig.10 ratios @xmath94 , for all wave functions increase with an increase of the @xmath85 rapidity of the pion and has a maximum approximately at the point @xmath88 . in the region",
    "@xmath95 resummed higher - twist cross section is suppress by about half order of magnitude relative to the higher - twist cross section calculated in the framework of the frozen coupling approach .",
    "besides that , the ratio decreases with an increase in the @xmath85 rapidity of the pion .",
    "as is seen from fig.10 , the ratio @xmath96 depends on the choice of the pion wave function .",
    "analysis of our calculations shows that @xmath69 , @xmath70 higher - twist cross sections and ratio sensitive to pion wave functions predicted holographic and perturbative qcd .",
    "we have also carried out comparative calculations in the center - of - mass energy @xmath97 and obtained results are displayed in fig.11-fig.14 .",
    "analysis of our calculations at the center - of - mass energies @xmath86 and @xmath98 , show that with increasing in the beam energy contributions of higher - twist effects to the cross section decrease by about one - two order . as is seen from fig.5 , fig.7 , fig.10 and fig.13 that infrared renormalon effects enhance the perturbative predictions for the pion production cross section in the proton - proton collisions about 2 - 3 order .",
    "this feature of infrared renormalons may help the explain theoretical interpretations with future experimental data for the pion production cross section in the proton - proton collisions",
    ". in our calculations , the higher - twist cross section of the process the dependence of the transverse momentum of pion appears in the range of @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , higher - twist cross section obtained in our work should be observable at rhic .",
    "proton - proton collisions are known are known to be the most elementary interactions and form the very basis of our knowledge about the nature of high energy collisions in general .",
    "physicists , by and large , hold the view quite firmly that the perturbative quantum - chromodynamics provides a general framework for the studies on high energy particle - particle collisions .",
    "obviously , the unprecedented high energies attained at large hadron collider offer new window and opportunities to test the proposed qcd dynamics with its pros and cons .",
    "however , we should remember that lhc opens a new kinematical regime ah high energy , where several questions related to the description of the high - energy regime of the qcd .",
    "consequently , studies of proton - proton interactions at the rhic and lhc could provide valuable information on the qcd dynamics at high energies . in this work the single meson inclusive production via higher twist mechanism within holographic qcd",
    "are calculated . for calculation of the cross section ,",
    "the running coupling constant approach is applied and infrared renormalon poles in the cross section expression are revealed .",
    "infrared renormalon induced divergences is regularized by means of the principal value prescripton and the resummed expression ( the borel sum ) for the higher - twist cross section is found .",
    "it is observed that , the resummed higher - twist cross section differs considerably from that found using the frozen coupling approximation , in some region .",
    "the following results can be concluded from the experiments ; the higher - twist contributions to single meson production cross section in the proton - proton collisions have important phenomenological consequences , the higher - twist pion production cross section in the proton - proton collisions depends on the form of the pion model wave functions and may be used for their study .",
    "also the contributions of renormalons effects within holograpich qcd in this process are essential and may help to analyse experimental results .",
    "further investigations are needed in order to clarify the role of higher - twist effects in qcd .",
    "especially , the forthcoming rhic and lhc measurements will provide further tests of the dynamics of large-@xmath0 hadron production beyond the leading twist .",
