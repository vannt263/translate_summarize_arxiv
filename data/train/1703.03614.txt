    "the success of numerical calculations in lattice field theory relies on the availability of probabilistic polynomial algorithms for computing observables in a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",

    "are density of states ( dos ) techniques @xcite , @xcite  @xcite . here we develop further the density of states functional fit approach ( dos ffa ) and apply it to su(3 ) lattice gauge theory with static color sources ( su(3 ) lgt - scs ) .",
    "the dos ffa was already presented in depth in @xcite  @xcite and we refer to these papers for a detailed discussion of the method .",
    "here we review only the parts specific for the su(3 ) lgt - scs and the respective observables , which are related to the particle number and its susceptibility used to determine a qualitative picture of the phase diagram .",
    "we stress at this point that the results presented here are not meant as a detailed systematic study of the phase diagram of su(3 ) lgt - scs , which would imply a controlled thermodynamical limit followed by extrapolating to vanishing lattice spacing .",
    "this paper serves to document the developments and tests of the dos ffa in a model which is a further step towards a density of states calculation in full lattice qcd at non - zero chemical potential .",

    "the expression ( [ partitionsum ] ) makes clear the emergence of the complex action problem in the dos formulation : the density @xmath19 is integrated with the oscillating function @xmath26 , and from the definition of the coupling @xmath27 in ( [ eq : action - imaginary ] ) it is obvious that the frequency of the oscillation increases exponentially with @xmath1 ( and linearly with @xmath10 ) , such that @xmath19 has to be computed with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the recent developments of dos techniques @xcite  @xcite are based on new strategies for calculating @xmath19 with very high precision .",
    "for a dos calculation the density @xmath19 has to be parameterized on the interval @xmath28 $ ] in a suitable way . for our parameterization",

    "we normalize the density using the condition @xmath36 , which corresponds to @xmath37 .",

    "we stress that the intervals can be chosen with different sizes such that in regions of @xmath25 where @xmath19 varies quickly a finer discretization can be used .    for computing the slopes @xmath39 in the dos ffa we use restricted vacuum expectation values @xmath43 , @xmath44 , which depend on a free parameter @xmath45 .",

    "the free parameter @xmath49 , which the restricted vacuum expectation values @xmath43 depend on , can be used to probe the system .",
    "we stress that the restricted vacuum expectation values are free of the complex action problem and can be evaluated with standard monte carlo calculations .",
    "the key observation of the dos ffa is that with the parameterization ( [ rhoparameterized ] ) the restricted partition sum @xmath50 and thus the restricted vacuum expectation value @xmath51 can be computed in closed form .",
    "it is convenient to shift and rescale the @xmath43 into a new form @xmath52 for which one finds the explicit expression @xcite ",
    "@xcite : @xmath53 where in the last step we introduced the function @xmath54 .",
    "we find that the shifted and rescaled expectation value @xmath52 is given by @xmath55 , i.e. , it depends only on one of the parameters of @xmath19 , the slope @xmath39 in the respective interval @xmath35 .",
    "thus we can compute @xmath52 for several values of @xmath49 and determine @xmath39 from a fit of the data for @xmath52 with @xmath55 . the function",

    "we remark that analyzing the quality of the fit is an important self consistency check and poor quality of the fit indicates that the size @xmath60 of the corresponding interval should be chosen smaller @xcite  @xcite .",
    "once the slopes @xmath39 are computed , the density @xmath19 can be determined with ( [ rhoparameterized ] ) and from @xmath19 we can evaluate the observables .    before we come to presenting our results for observables in the next section , we have a look at the density and how it changes when varying the parameters . in fig .
