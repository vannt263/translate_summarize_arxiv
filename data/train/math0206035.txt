    "a coxeter group is said to be right - angled if for any two distinct simple reflections their product has order @xmath0 or @xmath1 . due to their special properties and rich structure ,",
    "right - angled coxeter groups often arise in different geometric and algebraic problems . in a sense ,",
    "the most interesting right - angled coxeter groups are those which can be presented as groups generated by reflections in hyperbolic spaces . examples of geometric applications of such groups can be found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these groups also occur as weyl groups of certain kac  moody lie algebras @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the representations of right - angled coxeter groups @xmath2 and the corresponding hecke algebras @xmath3 .",
    "an important difference between hyperbolic reflection groups and affine or finite coxeter groups is that the former do not usually have a local system of generators in the sense of @xcite .",
    "in particular , the groups @xmath4 ( see  [ pn ] ) that are generated by reflections in the hyperbolic plane about the sides of right - angled can be called anti - local since only adjacent generators in the canonical system of simple reflections commute .",
    "this means that we can hardly hope to construct the representations of these groups inductively using the approach suggested in  @xcite . at the same time",
    ", we can still use the global methods of @xcite and try to describe the kazhdan  lusztig cells in our groups .",
    "it appears that certain symmetries of the initial groups are reflected in the structure of the partitions into cells making the cells trackable .",
    "our main results concern the groups @xmath4 but the methods can be applied to the other right - angled coxeter groups as well .",
    "we show that the partition of the group @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) into left cells consists of infinitely many elements and give an explicit description of the cells . at the same time , all the left cells in our groups form precisely three two - sided cells ( one of which is , of course , the trivial cell ) .",
    "it was first shown in @xcite that the number of one - sided cells of a hyperbolic coxeter group can be infinite , but there the author used an implicit argument and obtained only a conjectural structure of the corresponding cell - partitions ( see also @xcite for discussion ) .",
    "the fact that infinitely many left cells can still fall into finitely many two - sided equivalence classes and hence give rise to only finitely many @xmath3-bimodules seems to have been previously unnoticed .",
    "the explicit description of the cells makes it possible to consider corresponding representations of the coxeter groups and their hecke algebras .",
    "here we only start the related analysis leaving more detailed considerations for the future .",
    "we discuss the representations using @xmath2-graphs which were also introduced in @xcite .",

    "the cells and corresponding representations were constructed for an arbitrary coxeter group and then thoroughly studied in the finite and affine cases .",
    "left cells of the group @xmath4 can be visualized on the corresponding tessellation of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "figure  2 presents the cells for the group @xmath402 : the pentagon in the center is the unit cell , five shaded regions represent the cells of type  ( i ) all giving a one two - sided cell ( see corollary  [ cor3 ] ) , each white region represents a cell of type  ( ii ) and altogether they form the third two - sided cell .          the distinguished involutions are related with algebra @xmath404 defined in  @xcite which may be regarded as an asymptotic version of hecke algebra @xmath3 . using the methods from  @xcite this corollary can be applied to retrieve a partial structure information about algebra @xmath404 of the group @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath2-graphs associated to the left cells of type  ( i ) are infinite rooted trees ( binary trees for the group @xmath402 , see figure  3 ) , while the @xmath2-graphs associated to the type  ( ii ) cells admit infinitely many different cycles .",
    "one can see that all the @xmath2-graphs corresponding to the cells of type  ( i ) of the group @xmath4 define equivalent representations of @xmath3 , with the equivalences induced by the cyclic permutations of the simple reflections @xmath116 .",
    "we suppose that the representations corresponding to the cells of type  ( ii ) are also all equivalent , but this does not readily follow from the above arguments .",
    "* the unit cell corresponding to the trivial representation of @xmath405 ; * the union of the left cells of type ( i ) ( a @xmath284-dimensional cell ) , the corresponding @xmath2-graph is an infinite tree ; * the union of the left cells of type ( ii ) ( a @xmath0-dimensional cell ) , the corresponding @xmath2-graph admits infinitely many different cycles .",
    "the remarkable point about this corollary is that to establish it we actually need only the moves a , b from the proof [ theorem ] with their right - side analogs , and so we do not use part ( 2 ) of the argument which relies on certain very strong results about distinguished involutions ."
