    "multidimensional simulations of sne  ia explosions presently seed one or more hot spots at or near the center of a white dwarf and use a flame model to describe the subsequent evolution ( see for example @xcite ) . variations in the size , number , and distribution of these seeds can lead to large differences in the explosion outcome @xcite . the convective flows leading up to ignition",
    "have mach numbers of 0.01 or less , with temperature perturbations of only a few percent @xcite  conditions that are extremely challenging for fully compressible codes .",
    "one - dimensional statistical methods @xcite predict that off - center ignition is likely , but they can not give information about the distribution of the hot spots .",
    "only recently has progress been made in multidimensional modeling of convection in white dwarfs .",
    "the first such calculations @xcite evolved a two - dimensional wedge of the star for a few hours using an implicit hydrodynamics algorithm .",
    "convective velocities of approximately 100  km  s@xmath0 developed .",
    "they observed compression near the center of the star leading to slightly off - center ignition .",
    "three - dimensional anelastic calculations @xcite , showed a large - scale dipole flow dominating the evolution , leading to an off - center ignition .",
    "these simulations used a spectral decomposition , with a small portion of the center of the star removed due to the coordinate singularity at @xmath1 .",
    "neither of these calculations operated at a reynolds number large enough to see fully developed turbulence .",
    "further three - dimensional studies are needed to see how robust this dipole flow is to rotation and convection at higher reynolds and rayleigh numbers .",
    "the goal of the present work is the development of a new multidimensional hydrodynamics algorithm capable of evolving the full star from the convective phase , though ignition and into the early stages of flame propagation .",
    "long time integration is critical .",
    "as we showed previously ( @xcite  henceforth paper  i ) , the low mach number hydrodynamics equations provide an accurate description of flows with mach numbers less than 0.2 . by filtering out sound waves",
    ", the low mach number approximation allows for much larger time steps ( @xmath2 larger ) than corresponding compressible codes .",
    "in contrast to the anelastic equation set , the low mach number equations are capable of modeling flows with finite - amplitude density and temperature perturbations .",
    "the only restriction is that the pressure perturbation be small .",
    "furthermore , because the compressibility effects due to both the background stratification and local heat release are included , the low mach number equations set can self - consistently evolve the expansion of a hydrostatic atmosphere due to heat release @xcite .    in this paper , we continue the development of the low mach number hydrodynamics algorithm to include the effects of heat release",
    ". an energy equation is added , and an earlier assumption from paper  i is relaxed , now allowing the background state to vary in time . in ",
    "[ sec : lmn ] we develop the low mach number equation set . in   [ sec : numer ] the numerical methodology is explained .",
    "comparisons to fully compressible calculations are provided in ",
    "[ sec : results ] to demonstrate the accuracy and utility of our new algorithm .",
    "we conclude in   [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in paper  i , we derived a system of low mach number equations for stellar atmospheres for which there was a time - independent background state .",
    "the necessary assumption for validity of this system was that the mach number ( @xmath3 ) of the flow be small . in this case ,",
    "any pressure deviations from the base state pressure , which are @xmath4 are also small .",
    "the perturbations of density and temperature need not be small .",
    "this system is valid for many low mach number terrestrial and stellar flows , but fails to capture the correct atmospheric response to large - scale heating that radially shifts the entire atmosphere at and above the level at which the heating occurs .",
    "this was shown analytically for the terrestrial atmosphere , using the pseudo - incompressible approximation , in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that when time variation of the background state is correctly included , the solution calculated by the low mach number equation set is identical to that reached by the fully compressible equation set .",
    "physically , this is consistent with the interpretation of the low mach number equations as representing instantaneous acoustic equilibration . if heating of a local parcel of fluid results in a large temperature perturbation from the ambient , the effect of the resultant acoustic waves is to return the parcel to pressure equilibrium with the fluid around it by expansion of the parcel .",
    "the density and temperature variations of the parcel relative to the ambient values may be large , but the parcel will remain close to pressure equilibrium .",
    "by contrast , when an entire layer of the atmosphere is heated , the acoustic equilibration process brings the entire layer to a new hydrostatic equilibrium . consider a horizontally uniform atmosphere with heating uniformly applied throughout a horizontal layer .",
    "the response of the atmosphere will itself be horizontally uniform , and for positive heating each parcel of fluid above the heated layer will rise in its respective radial column . in equilibrium ,",
    "given the assumption that no fluid is lost at the top boundary , then following an upward shift of each parcel , the mass of fluid above any given parcel will not have changed .",
    "if gravitational acceleration is effectively constant over the length scale of the base state displacement , then the weight of fluid above a parcel will not have changed .",
    "thus for an atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium the pressure of each parcel will not have changed , although that parcel will have changed its radial location . in other words , the material derivative , rather than the time derivative , of the base state pressure must be zero .",
    "numerical examples in ",
    "[ sec : results ] of this paper will confirm the time - dependent response of the base state as well as of the full state is necessary to correctly capture the atmospheric response to large - scale heat release .",
    "we note that the assumption of constant gravity over the displacement distance of the base state does not mean one must assume constant gravity over the full domain . in practice",
    "the length scale of the base state adjustment is much smaller than the length scale of more localized motions .",
    "we now generalize the low mach number equation set from paper  i to allow for time dependence of the base state .",
    "we recall from paper  i the fully compressible equations of motion in a stellar environment , but here we add an external heat source , @xmath5 , and again neglect compositional and reaction terms : @xmath6 and an equation of state @xmath7 here @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the density , velocity , temperature and pressure , respectively , @xmath12 is the total energy with @xmath13 representing the internal energy , and @xmath14 is the radially dependent gravitational acceleration ( resulting from spherically symmetric self - gravity ) , @xmath15 is the unit vector in the radial direction , and @xmath16 is the thermal conductivity .",
    "the reynolds number of flows in a typical white dwarf is sufficiently large that we neglect viscosity here , though viscous terms could easily be included in the model and the numerical methodology .",

    "@xmath27 represents the horizontal coordinate directions and @xmath28 represents the radial direction .",

    "summarizing the low mach number equation set for this specialized case , with the momentum equation re - written as an evolution equation for velocity , we have @xmath50 where we define , for convenience , @xmath51 .",
    "this system differs from that in paper  i in that now @xmath23 and @xmath52 are unknowns as well as @xmath8 , @xmath53 , @xmath9 , and @xmath24 . the equation of state was used to derive the constraint thus to include it here would be redundant .",
    "when reactions and compositional effects are included in future work , evolution equations for species will be added to this system and reaction terms will be added to the enthalpy equation and divergence constraint , but for the hydrodynamical tests we present here this system is sufficient .    we follow the approach used in @xcite to compute the time evolution of the base state , recalling from the beginning of this section that the pressure of each parcel remains unchanged during base state adjustment , i.e. , @xmath54 we first calculate the radial velocity field , denoted @xmath55 , that adjusts the base state .",

    "we consider three numerical tests in this section , each studying the response of the atmosphere to prescribed external heating . for each test case ,",
    "the initial conditions in the computational domain are specified in two parts .",
    "the lower portion of the domain is initialized with a one - dimensional hydrostatic white dwarf model up until the outer boundary of the white dwarf .",
    "this initialization is identical for the compressible and low mach number models .",
    "the model is created by specifying a base density of @xmath163 and base temperature of @xmath164  k and integrating the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium outward while constraining the model to be isentropic .",
    "the composition is held constant at 0.3  @xmath165c and 0.7  @xmath166o , and the gravitational acceleration is fixed at @xmath167  cm  s@xmath168 .",
    "we use the stellar equation of state developed by @xcite .",
    "this procedure provides a reasonable approximation of the state of the white dwarf just before runaway .",
    "none of the methods described here require constant gravity , but it was assumed for simplicity in the comparisons .",
    "the upper portion of the domain represents the region beyond the outer boundary of the white dwarf , and different approximations are used there for the compressible and low mach number models . for the compressible calculations , the integration proceeds radially outward until the density reaches a threshold value of @xmath169 . throughout the integration we set a low temperature cutoff of @xmath170  k , to keep the temperature in the outer layers of the model reasonable .",
    "once the density drops below its cutoff , the integration is stopped and the material above it is held at constant density and temperature .",
    "this buffer region is necessary to allow for expansion of the star ; otherwise , as the star expands the loss of mass through the upper domain boundary would change the base pressure @xcite , impacting the dynamics throughout the domain . finally , for the multidimensional test cases , we add a convectively stable layer below the atmosphere to prevent any motions generated from the heating from interfering with the lower boundary .",
    "figure  [ fig : initialmodel ] shows the initial temperature , density , entropy , and adiabatic indices ( @xmath171 and @xmath172 ) as a function of height for the compressible background .    for the low mach number model applied to the second and third test cases ,",
    "the density cutoff is set to @xmath173 , approximately the value at which the temperature cutoff is applied for the compressible background .",
    "once the density reaches this cutoff the density , temperature and pressure are held constant , equivalent to gravity being set to zero radially outward of that position . because the base state density in the buffer region is significantly higher for the low mach number calculations than for the compressible calculations , this buffer region serves to damp motions that reach it without impacting the hydrostatic equilibrium of regions toward the center . since the time step for the entire calculation is determined by the largest velocity in the domain , this damping is essential for low mach number calculations in order to avoid excessively large velocities above the cutoff that would dictate an excessively small time step .",
    "an additional approximation in the outer region is that we set @xmath145 for @xmath174 in order to suppress spurious wave formation at the outer boundary of the star . in the first test",
    ", a layer of the star is heated for 5.0  s with a heating profile , @xmath175 with @xmath176  cm , @xmath177  cm , and @xmath178  erg  g@xmath0  s@xmath0 .",
    "this energy generation rate is quite a bit higher than we would expect during the smoldering phase of the convection leading up to an sn  ia @xcite , but necessary to see a response with the compressible code on a reasonable timescale .",
    "it also provides a more stringent test of the hydrostatic adjustment than a lower energy generation rate would give .",
    "because the initial conditions and the heating are both one - dimensional , we use a reduced one - dimensional form of the equations to solve the systems .",
    "we contrast three different systems of equations .    for this one - dimensional test , we compare the low mach number results to those produced by the fully compressible ppm method @xcite , as implemented in the flash code @xcite .",
    "two versions of the low mach number algorithm are used for this test .",
    "the first is the low mach number equation set with time - varying base state ( as described in   [ sec : lmn ] ) .",
    "the second is a formulation of the low mach number equations in which the base state is time - independent ( equivalent to the equation set present in paper  i ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : oned_compare ] shows the density , temperature and pressure for the three solutions at @xmath179  s. all simulations were run on a uniform grid with 768 zones spanning @xmath180 cm .",
    "the compressible and low mach number expanding background solutions show excellent agreement . in the region of heating ,",
    "the temperature has increased enormously , with a corresponding density decrease .",
    "the amplitude of the density decrease is much smaller , due to the degenerate nature of the equation of state .",
    "the inset in the density plot shows the density adjustment on a linear scale , showing the decrease at the heating height and an increase in the density above this .",
    "both equation sets reach the same solution in response to the heating .",
    "the differences above @xmath181  cm are due to the different treatments of the upper boundary , and are not significant to the atmospheric dynamics . as a result of the energy deposition ,",
    "the model expands by almost @xmath170  cm , or about 5% .",
    "in contrast , when the background is not allowed to adjust ( dashed line ) , the low mach number model fails to capture the expansion .",
    "while the temperature increases in the region of the heating , there is no expansion in the material above the heating layer .",
    "this is consistent with the point made in @xcite that the pseudo - incompressible equation set does not give the correct solution in the terrestrial atmosphere when the base state is not allowed to vary in time , and the demonstration in @xcite that the correct solution is found when the base state does absorb the horizontally averaged heating .",
    "figure  [ fig : oned_compare_diff ] shows the difference in density before and after heating . here",
    "we see more clearly the adjustment of the density structure as a result of the localized heating .",
    "there is a slight rise in the density in the compressible solution below the heated layer .",
    "this small error is due to the difficulty in constructing a lower hydrostatic boundary that allows sound waves to leave the domain .",
    "for the low mach number case , the state remains unchanged below the heating layer , as it should .",
    "the compressible and expanding background low mach number solutions show a large increase in the density above the heating layer .",
    "this is not present in the low mach number case where the background was not allowed to expand .    in even this one - dimensional simulation ,",
    "the choice of boundary conditions at the top and bottom boundaries of the computational domain is critical for the compressible calculations .",
    "the fully compressible code generates sound waves as it struggles to keep the hydrostatic solution steady on the grid .",
    "the boundary conditions must allow these disturbances to leave the domain or they will corrupt the solution .",
    "we use a hydrostatic lower boundary , integrating the pressure and density in the ghost cells using a fourth - order reconstruction of the pressure @xcite , where the temperature is kept constant in the ghost cells and the velocities are given a zero gradient .",
    "this provides pressure support to the material while allowing sound waves to leave the domain .",
    "further robustness is obtained by computing the hydrostatic structure in the boundary from the initial base density and temperature , and keeping this structure fixed in time . at the upper boundary",
    ", we set the density and temperature to our cutoff values and allow the fluid to move out of the domain ( with a zero gradient ) but set inward velocities to zero .",
    "this has the effect of keeping the fluid velocities in this region small , and therefore , they do not dictate the time step .",
    "the low mach number calculations , by contrast , are not sensitive to mass exiting the top boundary , as the hydrostatic equilibrium is incorporated into the base state , which is independent of the total mass .",
    "a simple outflow boundary condition is used at the top ( with any inflowing velocities set to zero ) , and a reflecting boundary condition is used at the bottom boundary .",
    "additionally , the compressible calculations need to resolve the scale height of the atmosphere very well to suppress any ambient velocities generated by slight imbalances of the pressure gradient and gravitational force ( see @xcite for a discussion of this ) .",
    "this is not the case with the low mach number method , so we expect our low mach number solutions to numerically converge at a lower resolution than the compressible solutions .    for the second and third tests",
    ", we consider fully two - dimensional heating profiles , in which both parts of the new low mach number algorithm are fully exercised .",
    "for these cases we compare the new low mach number formulations with the compressible solution .",
    "in addition to the ppm algorithm , these multidimensional tests are also run with an unsplit compressible algorithm @xcite , adapted to a general eos , and incorporated into the flash framework .",
    "this is the same implementation of the unsplit method we described in paper i. the computational domain for these tests is @xmath180 cm by @xmath182 cm , spanned by a uniform grid with 640@xmath183 896 zones .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used on the sides of the domain .    in the second test ,",
    "we specify three local regions of heating , designed to mimic `` hot spots , '' but no heated layer as in the first case . in this scenario , while both the horizontal average and the local deviations from the horizontal average are non - zero , the deviations are much larger than the average , so the dominant effect is the local rather than horizontally averaged atmospheric response to the heating . for the first two seconds the heating profile has the form @xmath184 where @xmath185 and the amplitudes , @xmath186 , locations , @xmath187 , and widths , @xmath188 , of the perturbations are given in table  [ table : pert ] .",
    "after the first two seconds @xmath42 is set to zero , and we continue to follow the evolution until @xmath189  s. figure  [ fig : test_case_2 ] shows a time sequence from @xmath190 to @xmath189  s of temperature contours in a subset of the domain spanning from @xmath191 cm to @xmath192 cm high .",
    "the temperature is an independent variable in the compressible calculations , but in the low mach number model , for these examples , we evolve density and compute temperature from the equation of state using density and @xmath23 .    at early times , the three methods agree very well ; at later times they diverge slightly .",
    "the vertical speed of the bubbles appears greatest with the low mach number methodology followed by the unsplit compressible formulation ; the ppm generates the slowest bubbles .",
    "we note that the difference in height between the flash ppm and unsplit methods is comparable to the difference between the unsplit and the low mach number bubble heights .",
    "the precise reason for these differences is not yet completely understood ; however , they serve to underscore the sensitivity of these flows and the difficulties in simulating them accurately with either the compressible or low mach number approach . figure  [ fig : test_case_2_res ] shows a resolution study of this second test case for each of the three methods .",
    "the general trend one observes is that the location of the bubble rises with increased resolution .",
    "however , we also notice that the low mach number model appears to converge to a solution at a lower resolution than either of the compressible models .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that hydrostatic equilibrium is guaranteed in the low mach number method by the base state , while the compressible methods need considerable resolution just to keep the background medium quiescent .",
    "we also notice the difficulty that the flash ppm method has at the higher resolution , evidenced by the strong oscillations in temperature .",
    "this was also observed and discussed in paper i.    in the third test , we add the heated layer of the first test case to the three `` hot spots '' of the second case , resulting in a case for which the horizontal average of the heating is larger than the perturbation from the average .",
    "the heating profile has the form @xmath193 where @xmath194  cm and the amplitudes , @xmath186 , locations , @xmath187 , and widths , @xmath188 , of the perturbations are as in the previous case and are given in table  [ table : pert ] .",
    "we apply the heating source for 2  s. as in the one - dimensional uniform heating case , we place the heating layer a bit above the lower boundary , so as to minimize contamination of the solution from lower boundary effects .",
    "figure  [ fig : nonuniform_compare ] shows the temperature contours for the unsplit compressible and low mach number solver at @xmath195  s , @xmath196  s and @xmath197  s. we again notice excellent agreement between the low mach number and compressible results .",
    "we do not expect the exact shape of the rising bubbles to match precisely given the extremely unstable nature of the bubble s surface , but there is overall agreement between methods .",
    "once again the low mach number bubble rises slightly faster .",
    "we do not show the flash ppm results here , as the noise resulting from the dimensional splitting dominates the solution .",
    "we also note that at the final time , the low mach number result shows a disturbance in the upper left corner of the domain .",
    "this disturbance is a result of a spurious wave generated at the outer boundary , which is not present in the compressible results because of the different treatment of the outer boundary condition .",
    "the question of how best to represent the outer boundary of the white dwarf in a low mach number calculation is still an open research question ; at this point we note that while the high - velocity disturbance does restrict the time step , it does not appear to impact the solution in the primary region of interest .",
    "we also expect that more realistic heating profiles in three - dimensional geometries will not generate the disturbances in the outer boundary that we have observed in this final test case .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare - test3-avg ] shows the horizontal average of the difference between density at @xmath197s and @xmath98s for the low mach number and unsplit compressible results shown in figure  [ fig : nonuniform_compare ] . on the left of this plot",
    "we see that the compressible solution has an increase in density over time below the level of the applied heating ; this was also present in the first test case , although to a lesser degree .",
    "this error results from the difficulty in prescribing an accurate hydrostatic lower boundary .",
    "we note , however , that this is less than a 0.1% relative error in the density at this boundary . at approximately the center of the heated layer ( @xmath198  cm ) each calculation shows a negative average density variation . the small difference here between the compressible and low mach number results here",
    "may also be a product of the lower boundary condition .",
    "overall , however , the two algorithms agree well in the average response of the atmosphere to the heating .    finally , since computational efficiency as well as accuracy is necessary for successful long - time integration , we comment on the relative efficiency of the low mach number algorithm . for the second test case , for example , to evolve the state to 4.0  s ,",
    "the unsplit compressible method took 14272 time steps while the low mach number algorithm took only 233 time steps .",
    "evolving to just 2.0  s on a single processor ( 2.8 ghz intel xeon ) using the intel 9.0 compilers ( with -o3 -ipo optimization flags ) took 71.76 hours with the flash ppm solver .",
    "flash was setup to use 32@xmath183 32 zone blocks for greatest efficiency . by comparison ,",
    "the low mach number method took only 0.46 hours  a factor of over 150 speed - up .",
    "the unsplit method takes the same timestep as the ppm algorithm but is approximately a factor of two slower , due to the additional work per timestep .    for the final test case , evolving the solution to 1.5  s took 6532 timesteps for the unsplit method and 749 time steps for the low mach number algorithm . already by this point in the calculation ,",
    "the spurious disturbance at the outer boundary of the star in the low mach number algorithm is impacting the time step , decreasing the relative advantage of the low mach number algorithm .",
    "as noted above , we expect this not to be the case for more realistic ignition scenarios .",
    "however , this case points out that to achieve the gains in efficiency possible with a low mach number model one must successfully address this issue .",
    "we have introduced a new algorithm for evolving low mach number flows in the presence of local and large - scale heating .",
    "by contrast with the previous low mach number model , this new model allows time variation of the base state in order to account for atmospheric expansion due to large - scale heat sources . the time evolution of the base state must be calculated at each time step in addition to the local dynamics .",
    "numerical comparisons of low mach number simulations with simulations using a fully compressible code demonstrate that the low mach number algorithm with a time - dependent base state can accurately capture the hydrostatic adjustment of an atmosphere as well as local dynamics in response to large- and small - scale heat release .",
    "our long - term goal is to develop the capability for full star simulation using the new low mach number approach .",
    "the fundamental low mach number approach has been validated with a number of simplified test cases , but further development is necessary to begin to perform detailed physics investigations of ignition and other problems of interest .",
    "this development will include extension to three dimensions with adaptive griding , radial representation of gravity and the base state within the three - dimensional setting , non - constant gravity , and the calculation of internal heating due to reaction networks .",
    "the tests presented above are quite demanding , and provided a challenge to both the low mach number and the compressible solvers . the energy generation and resulting temperature / density contrasts during the convective phase of an sn ia are much smaller .",
    "based on the agreement demonstrated on these difficult tests , we are confident that the low mach number hydrodynamics method will be a useful and efficient tool in exploring the problem of sne  ia ignition . in addition , this algorithm is applicable to a wide range of problems outside of our target application ( sne ia ) , including type i x - ray bursts , classical novae , and convection in stars .",
