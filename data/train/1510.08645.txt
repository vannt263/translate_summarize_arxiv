    "quantum adiabatic evolution is always of fundamental interests to physicists since the discovery of quantum adiabatic theorem  @xcite .",
    "it predicts the general and fundamental behaviors of a quantum system under a slow external driving . due to the approximated nature of adiabatic theorem , intrinsic deviation from what is predicted by adiabatic theorem",
    "inevitably arises  @xcite . although most of attention has been paid to the adiabatic deviations and conditions in the case of non - degeneracy energy spectrum , which seems theoretically more fundamental and simple  @xcite , the study on adiabatic evolution for degeneracy spectrum may be more important in a practical sense , which is more related to holonomic quantum computation and detection of fractional statistics .",
    "the study of degenerate adiabatic deviation may be closely associated with assessing the feasibility of topological gates using the concept of majorana non - abelian braiding  @xcite .    because the analytical formulae about the adiabatic deviation in the case of non - degeneracy energy spectrum are already very complicated , few people has ever touched upon that for the formidable degeneracy spectrum case  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty mostly comes from the abstract nature of hilbert space and the quantum - kind of formulae . in this paper , we focus on the adiabatic deviations during which the state under study is always degenerate with other orthogonal states by projecting the hilbert space onto a phase - space of classical form and mapping the eigenstates onto fixed points in the phase - space thus defined , which simplifies greatly the analytical expressions and enables the visual comprehension of the deviations .    in the current theory the aggregate of eigenstates in the degeneracy subspace forms a patch in phase - space rather than isolated point in the non - degenerate case .",
    "the patch can be high dimensional according to the degree of degeneracy . with the overall phase of wavefunction omitted , each point on the degeneracy subspace is a fixed point of classical form of hamiltonian . in the first - order theory with respect to slow adiabatic speed , which is of overwhelming importance , the difference between the real state and what is predicted by the wilczek - zee theory  @xcite is always perpendicular to the degeneracy patch ( see fig .  1 )",
    ", with the distance between the average of the oscillating deviation and the wilczek - zee point being proportional to the adiabatic speed .",
    "in higher order formulation , the deviation may have components in the degeneracy subspace if , more intuitively and physically , the degeneracy subspace in the whole phase - space changes its normal direction during the adiabatic manipulation .",
    "we use the example of the tripod scheme , where three laser beams are interacting with a free rubidium atom , to verify our theory .",
    "theoretically , the tripod scheme has been introduced to implement the non - abelian vector potential and spin - order coupling on neutral atoms  @xcite .",
    "technically we take advantage of the classical hamiltonian formulation of the schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "note that this classical formulation is purely mathematical and is _ not _ the traditional semiclassical limit @xmath0 .",
    "we consider a quantum system described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents time - dependent parameters in an adiabatic protocol .",
    "different from the ordinary systems , here @xmath1 has a discrete but degeneracy spectrum during the entire control protocol . in the case",
    "that the system is initially prepared on the degeneracy levels , the adiabatic evolution ( geometric phase ) can be described by the wilczek - zee phase  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been proven that , so long as the protocol is not executed in the mathematical limit @xmath3  @xcite , the deviation from what is predicted by wilczek - zee theory should be expected .    for simplicity and concrete discussion , we assume @xmath1 lives in a finite @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space with two eigenstates being degenerate ( the generalization to higher degree of degeneracy is straightforward ) .",
    "suppose @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the two degenerate states of @xmath1 , any state of the form @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) would be an eigenstate . in the energy representation",
    ", a state can be expressed as @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being non - degeneracy levels .    due to the abstractness of c - numbers in hilbert space",
    ", we alternatively employ real quantities and the corresponding classical form of phase - space to address the quantum state in hilbert space . in particular , in energy representation , we can define the classical phase - space point @xmath11 with @xmath12 , to describe the wavefunction and the phase - space without any approximation . with the phase - space thus defined ,",
    "the degeneracy region is the patch spanned by @xmath13 in the phase - space .",
    "next , let s turn to the evolution of wavefunction , which definitely satisfies the schrdinger equation defined by @xmath1 . in order to gain an insight into the dynamics in the perspective of classical form phase - space",
    ", we should express the schrdinger equation via the variables @xmath14 instead of the initial form of wavefunction .",
    "generally , as the unitary matrix to diagonalize @xmath1 is @xmath15 ( time ) dependent , it is more convenient to take advantage of a general but fixed representation , which may be more physical relevant , rather than the energy representation . in the fixed representation , a wavefunction can be expressed as @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the orthogonal bases in hilbert space .",
    "the classical phase - space and phase - space point is defined by @xmath18 with @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath19 are related via a @xmath15-dependent canonical transformation . by construction ,",
    "the schrdinger equation then yields the following hamilton s equations of motion without any approximation  @xcite , @xmath20 where the classical hamiltonian @xmath21 is obtained from the quantum hamiltonian @xmath1 via @xmath22 with the overall phase removed , the phase space in this classical formalism is just the projective hilbert space , which provides a clear perspective of the wavefunction and its adiabatic evolution .",
    "one final technical comment is in order .",
    "the mapping from the wavefunction components @xmath23 to phase space variables @xmath24 [ see eq .",
    "( [ definition ] ) ] becomes ambiguous when any one of the wavefunction component @xmath23 becomes zero .",
    "fortunately , this ambiguity can be easily overcome by adopting a different representation to re - express the wavefunction .",
    "for example , @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ definition ] ) is used to remove the overall wavefunction phase .",
    "if @xmath26 , one can always select another nonzero @xmath23 to carry out a similar mapping .",
    "during the adiabatic evolution , the initial wavefunction on the degeneracy patch should always be on the instantaneous degeneracy patch and follow the wilczek - zee theory . however ,",
    "as in the case of non - degenerate adiabatic following  @xcite , the deviation from what is predicted by wilczek - zee theory has been proven to arise  @xcite . in the language of phase - space point ,",
    "the deviation should be expressed , @xmath27+\\delta p_i,\\ \\   q_i(t)=\\bar{q}_i[r(t)]+\\delta q_i,\\ ] ] with @xmath28 being time - dependent deviations from the ideal adiabatic trajectory @xmath29 $ ] predicted by wilczek - zee theory . in what follows",
    "we develop the dynamics for @xmath28 to the first order of @xmath30 .    employing the dynamics  ( [ classical ] ) and the expression  ( [ expansion ] ) ,",
    "the dynamics for @xmath28 can be written , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an @xmath15-dependent @xmath33 matrix obtained from the second - order derivatives of @xmath21 .",
    "the expression @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) without subscript stands for the matrix stack of the whole set of @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , with @xmath12 , e.g. , @xmath38 because @xmath1 is degenerate , which gives rise to the null dynamics @xmath39 as long as the deviation @xmath28 is on the degeneracy patch , the matrix @xmath40 must be of linear dependence and the determinant @xmath41 .    in order to associate the dynamics with the wilczek - zee phase , we here carry out a canonical transformation from @xmath19 to @xmath42 , i.e. , @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a @xmath33 matrix diagonalizing @xmath40 , @xmath47 @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) is a column vector with each component being the linear combination of @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the first two columns ( lines ) of @xmath53 with null diagonal elements stand for the direction along @xmath54 and @xmath55 defined in eq .",
    "( [ idefinition ] ) , i.e. , on the degeneracy patch . even though the nonzero diagonal elements @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) may generally be complex numbers , the dynamics induced by @xmath53 and the corresponding vector @xmath58 is totally equivalent to the initial dynamics .",
    "the relation between @xmath58 and @xmath59 is embedded in the @xmath15-dependent matrix @xmath60 .",
    "in fact , the above transformation is in accord with the quantum - form representation transformation to energy - representation .",
    "because @xmath1 is doublet degenerate which determines a 2-dimensional degeneracy patch in classical phase - space , there are two zeros in @xmath61 which defines two orthogonal directions on this patch .",
    "when the deviation is on the patch , the temporal evolution of the wavefunction vanishes ( omitting the overall phase ) , @xmath39 .",
    "one can readily generalize that , for the @xmath62-folder degeneracy , the degeneracy regime is @xmath63 dimensional .",
    "thus the dynamics for the deviation reads , @xmath64 expressed all by new variables , the above equation becomes , @xmath65 where @xmath66,\\ ] ]    in eq .",
    "( [ firste ] ) , the last term on the right hand side is at least second - order with respect to @xmath30 which is negligible in the first - order theory ; the second term on the right is tightly associated with the wilczek - zee phase since @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) is defined as the variable predicted by wilczek - zee theory . at this stage , one may naturally ask what this term would be like in the current framework of phase - space of classical - kind . to answer this question , employing",
    "the original wilczek - zee formula becomes compulsory .",
    "for doublet degeneracy , the wilczek - zee theory predicts the wavefunction during the adiabatic evolution as , @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 satisfying , @xmath72 considering now an infinitesimal segment of the adiabatic process @xmath73 . after each @xmath73 , the difference of the final wavefunction and the initial one according to ( [ wz ] ) reads , @xmath74 which can be easily proven to be orthogonal with any differential of the wavefunction on the degeneracy patch , @xmath75 , @xmath76 equation ( [ wzo ] ) implies that , after an infinitesimal time interval , the change of wilczek - zee state is orthogonal with any infinitesimal state defined on the degeneracy patch . in the language of phase - space ,",
    "the projection of @xmath77 on the degeneracy patch vanishes . employing the same gauge as in ( [ firstdia ] ) , this term assumes the form , @xmath78    combining eq .",
    "( [ firstdia ] ) and ( [ firstwz ] ) and neglecting the third term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ firste ] ) , one can finally derive the dynamics for the deviation within the first - order approximation .",
    "@xmath79 which reveals the fact that , during degenerate adiabatic evolution , the deviation in the first - order approximation is always perpendicular to the degeneracy patch , with the projection of first - order state on the degeneracy patch satisfying the wilczek - zee theory .",
    "this property can be qualitatively explained : to fulfill the adiabatic following which is dictated by adiabatic theorem , a general driving force impelling the system along the adiabatic path must be present .",
    "suppose during the adiabatic process there is no deviation from fixed point ( eigenstate ) , the dynamics for the quantum state , described by @xmath34 and @xmath35 defined in ( [ definition ] ) , will always be , @xmath80 giving rise to a constant @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( quantum state ) . on the other hand , according to the adiabatic theorem , the state should not be a constant but follow the wilczek - zee path during the adiabatic evolution .",
    "this paradox legalizes the emergence of the intrinsic adiabatic deviation .",
    "however , in the case of degeneracy levels , the deviation in the degeneracy subspace can not induce a force ( all the states on the subspace are dynamical fixed point ) , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ classical0 ] ) still holds .",
    "thus it is natural that the deviation prefers to be perpendicular to the degeneracy patch .",
    "this result is in sharp contrast to the previous result of first order deviation  @xcite obtained by quantum adiabatic perturbation theory  @xcite , where the projection of first - order deviation onto the degeneracy subspace is not zero . this contradiction might arise from the fact that the ansatz of the evolving wavefunction taken in  @xcite has reduced the hilbert space and is thereby insufficient to describe all the possible states during degenerate adiabatic evolution , i.e.",
    ", the first - order state derived here",
    "falls out of the ansatz taken in  @xcite .",
    "the above treatment can be naturally generalized to the cases of higher degeneracy degrees .",
    "the only difference is that there are @xmath81 zero diagonal elements of @xmath53 shown in ( [ firstdia ] ) and the same number of zero - element of vector shown in ( [ firstwz ] ) , with @xmath82 being the degree of degeneracy .",
    "in fact , as in the case of non - degenerate case , the deviation vertical to the patch will generally oscillate . to evaluate the deviation , it is convenient to take the nonzero part of @xmath53 and @xmath77 associated with the dynamics perpendicular to the degeneracy subspace , @xmath83 @xmath84 the dynamics for the deviation then reads , @xmath85,\\ ] ] which clearly shows that the deviation orthogonal to the degeneracy region behaves like a multi - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "the averaged deviation , proportional to the adiabatic speed @xmath30 , reads , @xmath86 and the first - order deviation in the representation of @xmath58 , according to our convention ( [ conventionn ] ) , should be written as , @xmath87 which shows clearly again that the first - order deviation vanishes in the degeneracy subspace .",
    "as mentioned above , the relation between vector @xmath58 and the initial variables @xmath19 is embedded in @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath88 from which the first - order wavefunction can be obtained from the definition in eq .",
    "( [ definition ] ) .    because the first - order adiabatic deviation behaves like a harmonic oscillator , it forms another hamiltonian dynamics as that in the non - degenerate case  @xcite .",
    "as the center of the oscillator depends on @xmath30 , the first - order deviation will undergo a tiny adiabatic evolution as both @xmath15 and @xmath30 evolves slowly , which is identical with the situation in non - degenerate adiabatic process .",
    "in the last section , the first - order deviation is shown to be orthogonal to the degeneracy subspace . we in this section give the general formula for the high - order deviation .",
    "returning back to eq .",
    "( [ firste ] ) , the deviation @xmath48 is in fact the sum of all orders of the deviations , @xmath89 the dynamics of @xmath90 is in fact the tailor expansion instead of the first - order approximation associated with @xmath53 .",
    "however , the higher - order terms in the expansion is only associated with @xmath91 since the deviation on the degeneracy patch can never generate any driving force .",
    "first , let s consider the second - order term in eq .",
    "( [ firste ] ) .",
    "the dynamics for the second - order deviation then reads , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is defined as @xmath94 which has the same matrix dimension as @xmath53 .",
    "next , according to eq .",
    "( [ firste ] ) , the dynamics for the @xmath82th order deviation can be iteratively obtained as , @xmath95 with @xmath96^i\\gamma \\right\\}\\ ] ] the function @xmath97 in ( [ long ] ) is to take the @xmath98th - order terms in @xmath99    because @xmath100 is generally very different from @xmath46 itself , the deviation with the order higher than one will not be zero on the degeneracy subspace .",
    "however , if the normal direction of the degeneracy subspace in the whole hilbert - phase space keeps fixed as parameter @xmath15 changes , @xmath100 vanishes and the last term in eq .",
    "( [ firste ] ) is always zero , which means that in this case deviations of all orders are vertical to the degeneracy subspace and the formulation reduce to that for the non - degenerate case  @xcite .",
    "this sheds more light on the difference between the degenerate and non - degenerate adiabatic evolutions .    as seen iteratively from eqs .",
    "( [ o2 ] ) and ( [ ok ] ) , arbitrary order deviation evolves dynamically like a harmonic oscillator , with the center of the @xmath82th order depending on the temporal derivatives of @xmath15 up to the @xmath82th order .",
    "this situation is identical with that in the non - degenerate case .",
    "to verify our results , we employ the tripod scheme hamiltonian implemented by three laser beams interacting with rubidium atom . for convenience",
    "we adopt the same configuration as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where two laser beams are counter - propagating along the @xmath101-axis and the third laser beam is along the @xmath102-axis .",
    "the associated hamiltonian under rwa is given by @xmath103 with @xmath104 where the parameter @xmath105 is set to satisfy @xmath106 , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and @xmath107 is the wavevector of the laser fields .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath108 has two degenerate states with a null eigenvalue .",
    "we denote these two degenerate states as @xmath109 and it is straightforward to find their spatial dependence as follows @xcite , @xmath110e^{-i\\kappa ' z},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath111,\\\\        in the numerical simulation , we consider two scenarios : the quantum state emanates from ( i ) degeneracy subspace and ( ii ) the state predicted by eq .",
    "( [ fdeviation ] ) . then the parameter @xmath101 or @xmath102 is scanned as in the tripod scheme and calculate ( 1 ) the distance between real state derived by numerically integrating the schrdinger equation and its projection state in degeneracy subspace and ( 2 ) the distance between projection state and the state obtained by wilczek - zee theory .",
    "according to our results , the former , which stands for the deviation in vertical direction , should be a quantity of first - order of @xmath112 while the latter , which stands for the deviation in the degeneracy subspace , should be at least second - order .",
    "the typical results displayed in fig .  2 as well as",
    "other numerical results clearly demonstrate this property , which verify our theory numerically . here",
    "the distance between two states @xmath113 and @xmath114 is defines as @xmath115 .",
    "in summary , the deviation during quantum adiabatic evolution for degeneracy energy levels is studied both analytically and numerically . in the first - order formulation with respect to adiabatic speed",
    ", the deviation between exact state and wilczek - zee state will always be in the direction perpendicular to the degeneracy subspace .",
    "thus the deviation in the degeneracy subspace will be at least second - order .",
    "our findings are of fundamental interest to non - abelian quantum computation and topological braiding .",
