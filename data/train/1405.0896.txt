    "in this paper , we contribute to the geometric bogomolov conjecture for abelian varieties by investigating closed subvarieties of abelian schemes over constant varieties , where constant varieties are varieties over a function field which can be defined over the constant field of the function field .",
    "the geometric bogomolov conjecture for abelian varieties is an analogue of the theorem established by ullmo @xcite and zhang @xcite , called the ( arithmetic ) bogomolov conjecture . to describe this theorem ,",
    "let @xmath0 be a number field .",
    "let @xmath1 be an abelian variety over @xmath2 .",
    "a line bundle on @xmath1 is said to be _ even _ if it is preserved under the pull - back by the inverse @xmath3 of @xmath1 . to an even ample line bundle on @xmath1 , one associates the canonical height function , also called the nron ",
    "tate height , which is known to be a semi - positive definite quadratic form on the additive group @xmath4 . for an @xmath5 , the value at @xmath6 of the canonical height function",
    "is called the ( canonical ) height of @xmath6 .",
    "we say that a closed subvariety @xmath7 of @xmath1 _ has dense small points _ if , for any @xmath8 , the set of points of @xmath9 whose canonical heights are not greater than @xmath10 is dense in @xmath7 .",
    "it is known that the density of small points does not depend on the choice of even ample line bundles on @xmath1 .",
    "since the canonical height function is a quadratic form , it follows that a torsion subvariety has dense small points , where a torsion subvariety is the translate of an abelian subvariety by a torsion point .",
    "the ( arithmetic ) bogomolov conjecture for @xmath1 , which is the theorem of ullmo and zhang , claims that the converse also holds , that is , any irreducible closed subvariety @xmath7 of @xmath1 with dense small points is a torsion subvariety .",
    "the theorem of ullmo and zhang is generalized by moriwaki in @xcite to the case where @xmath0 is a field finitely generated over @xmath11 .",
    "he considered the arithmetic heights associated to `` big '' polarizations ( when the transcendence degree of @xmath0 over @xmath11 is positive ) and established the bogomolov conjecture with respect to the canonical height arising from a big polarization .",
    "we remark that this kind of heights are different from the classical `` geometric '' heights over function fields ; they are more arithmetic .",
    "it is then quite natural to ask whether there is an analogue of the theorem of ullmo and zhang over a function field with respect to the classical geometric height .",
    "now , let @xmath0 be the function field of a ( normal projective ) variety over an algebraically closed field @xmath12 . in @xcite",
    ", gubler has proved that the same statement as the theorem holds for abelian varieties over @xmath2 which are totally degenerate at some place . however",
    ", this statement does not hold for _ any _ abelian variety in fact .",
    "for example , one sees that , if @xmath1 is a constant abelian variety , that is , @xmath13 for some abelian variety @xmath14 over @xmath12 , then , for any closed subvariety @xmath15 of @xmath14 , the subvariety @xmath16 of @xmath1 has dense small points . more generally , for any abelian variety @xmath1 over @xmath2 , let @xmath17 be the @xmath18-trace of @xmath1 ( cf .",

    "then , one sees that , for any closed subvariety @xmath19 of @xmath20 , the closed subvariety @xmath21 of @xmath1 has dense small points .",
    "this means that , over function fields , an abelian variety may in general have an irreducible closed subvariety that is not a torsion subvariety but has dense small points .",
    "it should be remarked that , in the case of gubler , it follows from the assumption of total degeneracy that @xmath1 has trivial @xmath18-trace .",
    "therefore , there are no such subvarieties , and actually , he succeeded in establishing the same statement for such abelian varieties .    inspired by the work due to gubler , we formulate in @xcite a bogomolov conjecture for any abelian variety over a function field generalizing gubler s theorem , which we call the _ geometric bogomolov conjecture ( for abelian varieties ) _ ( cf . conjecture  [ gbcforav ] ) .",
    "this conjecture claims that any irreducible closed subvariety with dense small points is a _ special subvariety _ , which has been defined as the sum of a torsion subvariety and a closed subvariety coming from the constant subvarieties of the @xmath18-trace . in @xcite , we established a partial answer to the conjecture , and this result generalizes the theorem of the totally degenerate case by gubler in fact .",
    "further development can be found in @xcite , and more details of it are resumed in ",

    "we remark that the geometric bogomolov conjecture is still an open problem .",
