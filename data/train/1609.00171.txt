    "in the last decades the study of nematic liquid crystals in the presence of microstructured substrates has been the subject of intense research @xcite .",
    "this problem is interesting not only from a fundamental point of view , but also due to its practical applications , such as the design of zenithally bistable devices @xcite , or the trapping of colloidal particles on specified sites @xcite .",
    "the presence of the structured substrate typically distorts the nematic orientational order , leading to elastic distortions and the formation of topological defects . on the other hand",
    ", the substrate topography can determine the director orientation far away from the substrate .",
    "since the seminal work of berreman @xcite , this problem has been extensively studied and generalized in the literature @xcite . wetting and filling transitions by nematics on these surfaces have also been studied @xcite . when the substrate has cusps , disclination - like singularities generally appear at or very close to them @xcite . however , even when the substrate is smooth disclination lines may appear , in the nematic , close to the substrate @xcite . in both cases , these orientation - field singularities play an important role to understand the different textures of the nematic in contact with a patterned substrate under strong anchoring conditions .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the equilibrium nematic texture at substrates of arbitrary cross section , and determine how this texture determines the ( homogeneous ) nematic director in the far - field . anchoring transitions are identified as the transitions between nematic textures with different far - field orientations .",
    "we will assume that the nematic director field lies in the plane perpendicular to the patterned substrate longitudinal axis , and that the substrate lengthscales are large enough to ensure strong anchoring conditions on the substrate .",
    "in a few cases analytical results are available @xcite , but in general we have to resort to numerical methods .",
    "most studies involve numerical minimization of free - energy functionals such as the landau - de gennes or frank - oseen models .",
    "the landau - de gennes model describes the emergence of topological defects , but it is very time - consuming and it is difficult to obtain systematic results when the pattern length scales are much larger than the nematic coherence length . on the other hand , in the frank - oseen model topological defects need to be included by hand .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we extended the frank - oseen model to include disclination - like singularities near the cusps of a sawtooth substrate , and found excellent agreement with previous landau - de gennes calculations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we generalize this numerical method to surface reliefs of arbitrary sections ( with or without cusps ) , as well as in the presence of disclination lines in the nematic phase .",
    "we apply our method to study the anchoring transitions induced by the patterned substrate in sawtooth , crenellated and sinusoidal substrates under strong anchoring conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "is devoted we set the problem .",
    "the numerical technique is presented in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "results on sawtooth , crenellated and sinusoidal substrates are discussed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "finally , we end with the conclusions in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "and the relief profile @xmath0 . ]    we consider a nematic liquid in contact with a patterned substrate with a relief profile @xmath1 that favours local homeotropic anchoring of the molecules ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "translational symmetry along the @xmath2 axis is assumed , so that @xmath3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the substrate is periodic along the @xmath4-axis with a wavelength @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the nematic director field @xmath7 exhibits only in - plane distortions , and thus it can be parametrized by the angle @xmath8 between the local director and the @xmath9 axis , yielding @xmath10 . the nematic order may be represented locally by a traceless symmetric second - rank tensor order parameter @xmath11 , with cartesian components @xmath12 + \\frac 1 2 b [ l_il_j - m_i m_j]$ ] , where @xmath13 is the nematic order parameter , which measures the orientational ordering along the nematic director , and @xmath14 the biaxiality order parameter , which measures the ordering of the molecules along directions perpendicular to @xmath15 , characterized by the eigenvectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we consider uniaxial nematic liquid crystals , so that @xmath18 except close to the substrate or within the topological defect cores .",
    "note that an inversion of @xmath15 does not change the value of @xmath11 , and thus in nematics , @xmath15 and @xmath19 are physically equivalent configurations .    far from the substrate ,",
    "no specific orientation is imposed , but we require that the bulk nematic phase is oriented uniformly along some direction not specified , implying that @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "we anticipate that different nematic textures close to the patterned surface will lead , in general , to distinct nematic far - field orientations , and thus surface transitions will change the nematic anchoring with respect to the substrate reference plane @xmath22 . in general different textures have different symmetries , and thus the anchoring transitions are expected be first - order .",
    "close to the transitions the surface states are locally stable in a thermodynamic sense , and these geometries are ideal candidates for the design of zenithally bistable devices .",
    "the excess free energy @xmath23 can be written as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the elastic contribution , @xmath26 is the free - energy contribution associated to the anchoring of the nematogen molecules to the substrate and @xmath27 is the contribution associated to the disclination cores .",
    "@xmath25 is given by the frank - oseen elastic free energy @xcite : @xmath28\\bigg ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the volume occupied by the nematic liquid crystal , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the splay , twist and bend bulk elastic constants , respectively , and @xmath33 is the saddle - splay elastic constant .",
    "thus , using the parametrization of @xmath15 in terms of the field @xmath34 , the elastic contribution to the nematic free energy per unit length along the @xmath2 axis , @xmath35 , is : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the @xmath38 section of the volume occupied by the nematic liquid crystal .",
    "note that the twist and saddle - splay contributions vanish identically .",
    "if we further assume that the splay and bend elastic constants are equal , i.e. @xmath39 , then : @xmath40 the anchoring free - energy contribution @xmath26 is modelled by the rapini - papoular approximation @xcite @xmath41 where the integral is over the substrate surface @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the outwards unit vector normal to the substrate at @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the anchoring contribution to the nematic free energy per unit length along the @xmath2 axis , @xmath45 , is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the curve @xmath48 , parametrized by its natural parameter @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the angle between @xmath15 and @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 , with @xmath53 .     where the equation for the orientational field @xmath8 is solved .",
    "@xmath5 is the period of the substrate relief and @xmath54 is the height of the domain . ]    in order to obtain the equilibrium nematic texture , we have to minimize the functional @xmath55=f_e+f_a+f_c$ ] , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 given by eqs .",
    "( [ frank3 ] ) and ( [ rapini2 ] ) , respectively . due to the symmetries of the problem",
    ", we have to find the solution only in the @xmath38 region @xmath58 delimited by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and bounded below by one period of the substrate relief . the euler - lagrange equation associated to the functional @xmath59",
    "$ ] reduces to the laplace equation in @xmath58 , @xmath60 , subject to the boundary condition on the substrate : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the klman - de gennes extrapolation length @xcite .",
    "in addition , periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the sides @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and free ( neumann ) boundary conditions @xmath65 at the far field .",
    "some comments are in order at this point .",
    "first , other boundary conditions on the lateral sides are allowed .",
    "for example , we can assume that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is an integer .",
    "however , this condition leads to a solution of the laplace equation which is linear in @xmath4 far away from the substrate , leading to an infinite interfacial free energy as a result of elastic distortions in the bulk .",
    "as we are interested in the anchoring of an undistorted bulk nematic at a patterned substrate , we discard these solutions . on the other hand , we take the limit @xmath68 .",
    "finite values of @xmath54 are relevant to study nematic textures under confinement .    the continuum model described above is valid as long as all the characteristic relief lengths are much larger than the nematic coherence length @xmath69 , which is of the order of the molecular size . for strong anchoring conditions , @xmath70 and eq .",
    "( [ bc1 ] ) can be substituted by the strong anchoring condition @xmath71 on the substrate . for weak",
    "anchoring , @xmath72 , and in principle this lengthscale is also relevant . in typical liquid crystals",
    "@xmath73 nm and @xmath74 .",
    "however , if we assume that the typical lengthscale which controls the substrate pattern is @xmath5 , then strong anchoring conditions on the substrate may be considered also for @xmath72 if @xmath75 .",
    "we can justify this result by rescaling the domain by a factor @xmath5 @xcite : @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in order to minimize the free energy functional in this rescaled description , we solve the laplace equation in the rescaled domain subject to an effective anchoring potential @xmath78 on the substrate ,",
    "so the rescaled extrapolation length is @xmath79 in this limit .",
    "the question about the existence of anchoring transitions in the strong anchoring limit is related to the uniqueness of the solutions of the laplace equation subject to the boundary conditions described above .",
    "a standard analysis of the mathematical problem shows that the laplace equation is unique for a given integration domain and boundary conditions on the substrate .",
    "in fact , the eigenvalues of the laplacian with the corresponding homogeneous boundary conditions are strictly positive , as inferred from its rayleigh quotient , and the uniqueness of the solution is guaranteed via fredholm s alternative .",
    "thus , only one texture is expected under strong anchoring conditions .",
    "this result is consistent with previous results in the literature @xcite , where it is shown that for patterned and/or chemically heterogeneous substrates a unique nematic texture is observed if the extrapolation lengths are much larger than @xmath5 . on the other hand , a transition between an almost homogeneous and a distorted texture may be observed if any of the relevant extrapolation lengths is of order of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the driving force for this transition is the competition between the elastic and the anchoring contributions to the free energy .",
    "this mechanism is not relevant at large @xmath5 , since @xmath80 while @xmath81 when @xmath5 is large .    however , there is analytical , numerical and experimental evidence that different textures are indeed possible for a given substrate relief , even in the strong anchoring limit @xcite .",
    "the apparent contradiction with the previous result may be resolved by noting that some of the textures exhibit topological defects in the nematic , i.e. @xmath82 disclination lines or , in their absence , the relief has cusps . in the first situation ,",
    "the presence of a disclination line in the nematic modifies the domain where the laplace equation is solved , since the solution has a singularity at the defect core .",
    "in addition , a branch cut must be added in order to avoid the non - physical ( but mathematically sound ) jump of @xmath8 by @xmath83 when following a loop enclosing the defect core .",
    "thus the domain where the laplace equation is solved has to be modified by excluding both the defect core and the branch cut , with additional conditions on these new boundaries .",
    "furthermore , the free energy per unit length will have a contribution @xmath84 due to the destruction of orientational order at the core of the disclination line .    on the other hand , when the substrate relief has cusps",
    ", the angle @xmath8 exhibits a discontinuity under strong anchoring conditions .",
    "this implies that the solution has a disclination - like singularity close to the cusp , with its associated core contribution @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the strength of the singularity @xmath85 , i.e. its effective topological charge , is related geometrically to the opening angle of the cusp @xmath86 and the jump @xmath87 of the orientational field @xmath8 when crossing the cusp along the surface from right to left as @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "one posibility is that @xmath89 , which leads to @xmath90 .",
    "however , this is not the only option due to the physical equivalence between @xmath15 and @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , it is posible that @xmath91 for @xmath92 , which leads to @xmath93 . in each case , the boundary conditions are mathematically different , although physically equivalent .",
    "thus different textures may occur for the same substrate under strong anchoring conditions .",
    "the elastic energy per unit length along the @xmath2 axis has contributions associated to the disclination lines and the distortions close to the cusps of the form @xcite : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the total number of disclination lines in the nematic and the index @xmath96 runs over all the cusps on the substrate .",
    "the next - to - leading contribution to the free energy per unit length is expected to be independent of the lengthscale @xmath5 .",
    "thus , for large @xmath5 we expect only transitions between textures with the same leading - order contribution to the free energy given by eq .",
    "( [ asymptotic - core ] ) . however , we will see that for moderate values of @xmath5 other transitions between textures may be observed .",
    "for a nematic with a @xmath82-disclination line in the bulk , represented by the filled circle .",
    "the vertical dotted line corresponds to the branch cut , where a discontinuity of @xmath83 in the orientational field is observed .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the boundary of @xmath97 . ]",
    "analytical solutions of nematic textures in contact with patterned substrates are not available , in general .",
    "there are exceptions , which may be obtained , for example , by using conformal mapping techniques @xcite .",
    "otherwise , we have to resort to numerical methods .",
    "however , the presence of disclination lines and/or singularities associated to the surface cusps requires special techniques . in this section",
    "we will describe the method used to obtain the nematic textures in the presence of disclination lines and/or substrate cusps , which is based on the numerical methods used previously for the sawtooth substrate @xcite .",
    "first , we will assume that the number and positions of the disclination lines in the nematic are known . in this case",
    ", the elastic contribution will be a function of the number of disclination lines and their corresponding positions .",
    "their equilibrium values can be obtained by standard minimization techniques , such as conjugated - gradient methods .",
    "we split the orientation field @xmath34 in two terms : a singular contribution @xmath98 , associated to the disclination lines in the nematic and/or the disclination - like singular contributions due to the surface cusps , and @xmath99 which we require to be regular everywhere in the integration domain @xmath58 .",
    "if disclination lines are present in the nematic , we modify the integration @xmath58 to @xmath97 , excluding the defect core and the branch cut , which we will consider perpendicular as shown in fig .",
    "we choose @xmath98 periodic in @xmath4 , with period @xmath5 , satisfying the laplace equation in @xmath97 ( @xmath58 in the absence of disclination lines ) , which captures the singularities in the orientational field associated to the disclination lines and surface cusps .",
    "a possible choice , based in previous studies for the sawtooth substrate , is @xcite : @xmath100",

    "note that the contribution associated to the surface cusps vanishes as @xmath21 .",
    "by contrast , the nematic disclination term exhibits a piecewise linear behaviour as @xmath21 and its elastic contribution to the interfacial free energy diverges unless the total topological charge associated to the nematic disclination lines vanishes .",
    "therefore , we restrict our study to situations where the number of @xmath104-disclination lines in the nematic phase is the same as the number of @xmath105-disclination lines to ensure that the far - field director field is undistorted .",
    "for the non - singular part @xmath99 , we have to solve the laplace equation subject to periodic boundary conditions on the sides @xmath106 and free boundary conditions as @xmath21 .",
    "finally , @xmath99 satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath107 at the substrate .",
    "as mentioned above , the regularity of @xmath99 in the region @xmath58 implies that standard numerical techniques can be used . in ref .",

    "the elastic contribution to the interfacial free energy of the nematic ( per @xmath134 unit length and @xmath135period ) at this substrate was obtained analytically @xcite : @xmath189\\gamma\\left[\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}\\right]\\right)\\bigg ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath190 or @xmath191 , where @xmath192 numerical results are in excellent agreement with the analytical result ( see ref.@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "as @xmath193 , there is an anchoring transition from homeotropic to planar anchoring at @xmath194 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath178 at the transition may be altered in two ways .",
    "first , the core contributions @xmath84 associated to the effective disclination - like singularities may be different for the @xmath181 and @xmath182 textures . these core contributions will shift the transition ( from @xmath194 ) by a small amount , since @xmath195 for large @xmath5 . in the previous discussion we assumed that the splay and bend elastic constants are equal , in line with the observation that @xmath196 is very small for liquid crystals like 5cb , close to the nematic - isotropic phase transition . in order to estimate the effect of the elastic anisotropy on the anchoring transition , a perturbation theory around the one - elastic constant model was developed @xcite .",
    "the first order correction in @xmath196 is obtained using eq .",
    "( [ frank2 ] ) @xcite : @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the nematic orientation field for @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "the main contribution arises from the neighbourhood of the cusps , which leads to an additional term proportional to @xmath201 .",
    "we refrain from giving explicit expressions for this leading - order correction , which implies that the anchoring transition shifts to @xmath202 if @xmath203 , and below @xmath204 otherwise .",
    "physically this is due to the fact that the elastic distortions in the @xmath181 texture are mainly splay , while bend dominates in the @xmath182 texture ( see fig . 3 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "as a function of @xmath178 for different values of @xmath67 . ]    finally , @xmath181 and @xmath182 are not the only textures that are possible at a sawtooth substrate . as mentioned in section [ sec2 ] , the effective topological charges associated with the disclination - like singularities arising from the substrate cusps may be expressed as @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is one possible value of the topological charge and @xmath67 is an integer .",
    "therefore , there is an infinite number of ( pairs ) of topological charges @xmath184 and @xmath183 , since @xmath207 and @xmath208 and the periodicity requirement on @xmath8 requires @xmath209",

    "a similar behaviour was found for isolated wedges @xcite .      [",

    "[ fig10](a ) ) .",
    "we denote this texture by @xmath181 . as @xmath219 increases , the substrate roughness increases , and the orientational field exhibits large distorsions to follow the anchoring at the substrate .",
    "numerical results show that , under these circumstances , the elastic distortions are lowered by reorienting the nematic director field , in the groove , along the @xmath4 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10](b ) ) , and thus the texture exhibits planar anchoring , denoted by @xmath182 .",
    "this texture involves the nucleation of two disclination lines with opposite topological charges , located by symmetry above the top and bottom of the substrate relief , at a distance plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",

    "thus , at large @xmath5 only the @xmath181 texture is expected for any substrate roughness .",
    "however , the weak dependence of the interfacial free energy of the @xmath182 texture on @xmath5 implies that , for moderate values of @xmath5 , an anchoring transition between the @xmath181 and @xmath182 textures may be observed .",
    "[ fig12 ] shows the interfacial free energy of the @xmath181 and @xmath182 textures as a function of @xmath219 , for different values of @xmath5 . while the @xmath181 branch depends only on @xmath219 and",

    "the homeotropic anchoring state @xmath181 is favoured at low @xmath219 , while at large substrate roughness planar anchoring is observed , i.e. the @xmath182 has the lowest free energy .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath5 at the transition increases almost exponentially with @xmath219 .",
    "finally , as in the previous cases we can include the effect of the anisotropy of the elastic constants perturbatively .",
    "if we assume that the elastic distortions are on the @xmath38 plane , the conclusion is that the anchoring transition , which corresponds to moderate values of @xmath5 , may be shifted by this contribution , although qualitatively it will be very similar .",
    "however , if the twist elastic constant is smaller than @xmath230 , there is experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite evidence of a twist instability which breaks the azimuthal symmetry : the disclination line is no longer parallel to the @xmath2 axis , but exhibits a zig - zag structure which decreases the splay and bending distortions",

    "in this paper we report the results of a numerical investigation of the equilibrium nematic textures at patterned substrates under strong anchoring conditions .",
    "we used a modified frank - oseen model that accounts for the presence of disclination - like singularities near surface cusps , as well as disclination lines in the nematic .",
    "we considered three substrate reliefs : the sawtooth substrate , the crenellated substrate and the sinusoidal subtrate .",
    "for the sawtooth and sinusoidal substrates , we observed a homeotropic to planar anchoring transition as the substrate roughness is increased . on the other hand ,",
    "the crenellated substrate exhibits a more complex anchoring phase diagram , with a homeotropic to oblique anchoring transition , which depends not only on the substrate roughness but also on the surface anchoring strength .",
    "the latter results from the dependence of the core contribution of the cusp singularities on the anchoring strength .",
    "although we used the landau - de gennes model to obtain the defect core contributions to the free energy , any other model could be considered .",
