    "other articles consider the boundary control problem by replacing with a control from the boundary for the same semilinear equation .",
    "we will not study these boundary conditions while our methods could apply , but it would require some further analysis of the non - homogeneous boundary value problem for the nonlinear equation .     the control theory for the linear case @xmath22 is now well known .",

    "the study of the semilinear case @xmath31 is still in progress ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . to our knowledge",

    "+ the result of coron and trlat @xcite is quite different but could be described roughly as local controllability near a whole connected component of the set of steady states .",
    "the authors study local controllability by boundary control near a path of steady states , in dimension @xmath34 .",
    "notice that their method using quasi - static deformations , enables to compute effectively the control .",
    "remark also that an important part of our proof consists in proving that we can go from an equilibrium to another using the global compact attractor and is therefore similar , in spirit , to their result .",

    "another class of problems for which ( sgc ) holds , is the case where @xmath1 is almost linear , for instance globally lipschitzian or super - linear but with a growth of the type @xmath35 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",

    "therefore , one has to explain how to move from one equilibrium to another in the control problem .    at this point , we would like to make a remark about the dependence of @xmath1 on the space variable @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , in the references given above , @xmath1 is assumed to be independent of @xmath43 , in order to simplify the calculations and because it seems to be in the habit to do so in control theory . on the opposite , from the dynamical point of view , richer dynamics are welcome and it is in the habit to allow @xmath1 to depend on @xmath43 .",
    "we will allow this @xmath44dependence in this paper , however , we underline that :        the results of the references cited above should also hold for @xmath45 , as soon as the @xmath44dependence does not change the important properties of @xmath1 , as growth estimates , sign conditions     the result and the discussions of this paper are also meaningful for @xmath46 , since functions as @xmath47 can also generate non - trivial dynamics for .",

    "the three cases a , b and c may seem restrictive , but were chosen to fit to the already known results on existence of global compact attractors and local control :    * case a is the classical case where the local control can be proved by multiplier methods and the cauchy problem solved by sobolev embedding . * case b is the euclidean case with a subcritical nonlinearity which requires strichartz estimates . the corresponding stabilisation problem has been studied for instance by dehman , lebeau and zuazua in @xcite .",
    "* case c assumes the optimal geometric control condition . using the global strategy of @xcite ,",
    "we have recently proved the stabilisation and the existence of compact global attractor in this case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the unique continuation property was quite tricky and required some dynamical system tools associated with a unique continuation theorem requiring partial analyticity .",

    "@xmath176 and @xmath196 are in neighborhoods of equilibrium points , and so is @xmath197 . combining the previous argument",
    ", we can go from @xmath17 to @xmath18 through the control problem , via @xmath176 and @xmath198 .",
    "* step 8 : uniformity of the time of control . * by assumption , the time of local control is uniformly bounded by @xmath105 in a neighborhood @xmath103 of an equilibrium point . since the set of all the equilibria is a closed subset of the compact attractor @xmath132 and is therefore compact , the time of control @xmath105 can be chosen to be independent of @xmath116 and we can consider only a finite number of equilibrium points in the above arguments .",
    "for any neighborhood @xmath192 of @xmath132 and any ball @xmath199 , there is a time @xmath36 such that @xmath200 . considering the paths yielded by the above arguments to link two given points of @xmath199 ,",
    "there is only one last property to show : there is a time @xmath201 and a neighborhood @xmath192 of @xmath132 such that , for any @xmath202 , @xmath203 belongs to a neighborhood @xmath103 for some @xmath204 $ ] . to show this last property , we argue by contradiction .",
    "assume that there exist sequences @xmath205 , with @xmath206 , and @xmath207 such that @xmath208 does not cross any neighborhood @xmath103 for @xmath209 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath132 is compact , we can assume that @xmath210 converges to @xmath211 . because @xmath123 is a gradient dynamical system",
    ", @xmath212 belongs to a neighborhood @xmath103 for @xmath36 large enough , and thus @xmath213 also belongs to @xmath103 for @xmath191 large enough .",
    "this contradicts the definition of @xmath214 and the fact that @xmath214 goes to @xmath40 .",
    "first notice that theorem [ th ] is a result of semi - global controllability in the sense that the time of control depends on the sizes of the initial and final data .",
    "one may expect that , for the damped wave equation , the large balls converge , with a uniform exponential rate , to an absorbing ball @xmath215 , which contains the attractor @xmath132 .",
    "this would implies that the time of control in a large ball @xmath14 of radius @xmath216 is of order @xmath217 .",
    "however , proving such a uniform exponential rate of convergence to the absorbing ball is a difficult problem related to the uniform stabilization of the semilinear wave equation ( see @xcite and its application to the convergence to the absorbing ball in proposition 3.6 of @xcite ) .",
    "the arguments of the proof of theorem [ th ] are very related to the qualitative dynamics of the wave equation with the feedback control @xmath218 . in the simplest cases",
    ", one can follow the arguments to construct a simple control as illustrated in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "notice that the proof of theorem [ th ] is somehow constructive : the way to travel between two equilibrium points is described in terms of the heteroclinic orbits and moreover the local control may be explicit if it is obtained via a banach fixed point theorem . in this sense , our method of proof is more explicit than the leray - schauder fixed point argument used in the proofs of several control results for the nonlinear wave equations ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "of course , our proof of theorem [ th ] is not really constructive , because the computation of heteroclinic orbits is not explicit .",
    "but it is reasonable to expect some cases where approximations of the heteroclinic orbits are numerically known . in this case",
    ", our proof of theorem [ th ] gives an explicit way to compute an approximated control to connect two equilibrium points . by the way",
    ", the question whether theorem [ th ] can be proved by using a fixed point method as the one of @xcite , or not , is an open interesting question . in any case",
    ", we think that our method of proof is new and represents an interesting alternative to the proof by leray - schauder theorem , which is actually available only for weak nonlinearities .",
    "as noticed after theorem [ th - dyn ] , it is reasonable to think the attractor @xmath132 of as a finite number of isolated equilibrium points connected by heteroclinic orbits , as in figure [ fig1 ] . in this case",
    ", one can go from any equilibrium point to another one by following a finite number of heteroclinic orbits , forward or backward in time . in this point of view",
    ", the steps 5 and 6 of the proof of theorem [ th ] may seem unnatural .",
    "however , the above generic framework is not true in general : @xmath132 may contain a continuum of equilibrium points , which precludes the connection between two parts of @xmath132 via heteroclinic orbits .",
    "that is why , in the proof of theorem [ th ] , we used the topological connectedness of @xmath132 and not the connectedness in the sense of path of heteroclinic orbits .    * acknowledgements : * the authors are grateful to emmanuel trlat and enrique zuazua for interesting discussions .",
