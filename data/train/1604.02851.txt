    "strominger investigated in  @xcite the heterotic superstring background with non - zero torsion , which led to a complicated system of partial differential equations .",
    "this system specifies , in six dimensions , the geometric inner space @xmath7 to be a compact complex conformally balanced manifold with holomorphically trivial canonical bundle , equipped with an instanton compatible with the green - schwarz anomaly cancellation condition .",
    "the latter condition , also known as the bianchi identity , reads as the equation of 4-forms @xmath8 for some real non - zero constant @xmath5 .",
    "the 3-form @xmath9 is the torsion of the bismut connection of the hermitian metric , which is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the complex structure of @xmath7 and @xmath12 denotes the fundamental 2-form of the conformally balanced hermitian metric on @xmath7 .",
    "the form @xmath13 is the curvature form of some metric connection @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the curvature form of the instanton @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 satisfies the hermitian - yang - mills equation . for more details and results on the general theory of the strominger system ,",
    "see the recent paper @xcite and the references therein .",
    "li and yau obtained in @xcite the first non - khler solutions to the strominger system on a khler calabi - yau manifold . later , based on a construction in @xcite , fu and yau first proved the existence of solutions to the strominger system on non - khler calabi - yau inner spaces given as a @xmath18-bundle over a @xmath19 surface @xcite .",
    "there are several connections @xmath14 proposed for the anomaly cancellation equation , as the chern connection @xmath20 , the ( strominger-)bismut connection @xmath21 , the levi - civita connection @xmath22 or the connection @xmath23 ( see for instance  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "recently , fei and yau propose in @xcite to find solutions to the strominger system with respect to any connection in the canonical 1-parameter family of hermitian connections @xmath24 on the tangent bundle found by gauduchon in @xcite .",
    "the family @xmath24 includes the chern connection ( @xmath25 ) and the bismut connection ( @xmath26 ) . in order to present a more complete and unified study of the solutions to the strominger system , in this paper we will consider a 2-parameter family of metric linear connections @xmath0 that incorporates the family @xmath24 and also the connections @xmath27 and @xmath22 .",
    "more concretely , @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath28 ( i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( see section  [ family - connections ] for more details ) .",

    "the nilmanifolds ( corresponding to the lie algebras ) @xmath39 and  @xmath40 provide some invariant solutions to the strominger system when one sets the connection @xmath14 in the anomaly cancellation condition to be the connection @xmath3 or @xmath22 ( * ? ? ?",

    "* theorem 4.2 ) solutions with respect to @xmath1 , with @xmath42 and non - flat instanton , were given on @xmath38 .",
    "more recently , it is proved in @xcite that _ any _ invariant balanced metric compatible with an abelian complex structure @xmath11 provides a solution to the strominger system with @xmath42 and non - flat instanton , when we set the connection @xmath14 in the anomaly cancellation condition to be the bismut connection @xmath3 .",
    "this result has been used in @xcite as the starting point to produce conformally compact and complete smooth solutions to the strominger system with non - vanishing flux , non - trivial instanton and _ non - constant _ dilaton using the first pontrjagin form of the connection @xmath27 .    in @xcite , fei and yau",

    "the latter condition excludes both the chern connection ( @xmath25 ) and the bismut connection ( @xmath26 ) .",

    "in the sl(2,@xmath6 ) case , we prove that an invariant solution found in @xcite actually provides a solution to the heterotic equations of motion ( with respect to @xmath3 , with positive @xmath5 and the instanton being flat ) . in the solvable case",

    "moreover , invariant solutions to the strominger system with respect to the chern connection @xmath1 are also given on this solvmanifold ( notice that the nilmanifold @xmath47 has no solutions for @xmath1 , see  @xcite ) .",
    "in conclusion , the invariant solutions of the heterotic equations of motion given in this paper live on three different compact non - khler homogeneous spaces which are obtained as the quotient by a lattice of maximal rank of a nilpotent lie group ( the nilmanifold @xmath47 ) , the semisimple group sl(2,@xmath6 ) and a solvable lie group ( the solvmanifold @xmath48 ) .",
    "we conjecture that there is no other such homogeneous space admitting an invariant solution to the heterotic equations of motion with respect to a connection in the ansatz @xmath0 .",
    "the results in this paper are obtained after a careful analysis of the first pontrjagin form of the 2-parameter family of connections @xmath0 , and as a consequence many new solutions to the strominger system with non - flat instanton and @xmath5 of different signs are given ( see theorems  [ solutions - h3 ] , [ solutions - sl2c ] , [ solutions - g7-u=0 ] , [ solutions - g7-unot0 ] and table  1 ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ family - connections ]",
    "we introduce the family of metric connections @xmath49 which extends the canonical 1-parameter family of hermitian connections @xmath24 and also includes the levi - civita and the @xmath23 connections . after recalling the main ingredients in the strominger system ,",
    "we indicate how we will proceed in our searching of invariant solutions on compact quotients of lie groups by lattices .    in section  [ h3 ]",
    "we construct many invariant solutions with non - flat instanton on the nilmanifold @xmath50 with respect to the connections @xmath0 in the anomaly cancellation equation .",
    "in particular , we recover the solutions previously found in @xcite .    in section  [ sl2c ]",
    "we revisit the @xmath43 case , extending to the family of connections @xmath0 the study of invariant solutions .",
    "moreover , we provide solutions to the heterotic equations of motion with respect to the bismut connection .    section  [ g7 ] is devoted to the invariant hermitian geometry of the solvmanifold @xmath48 .",
    "we construct many new invariant solutions with respect to the connections @xmath0 in the anomaly cancellation equation , in particular , solutions for the chern connection @xmath20 with non - flat instanton and positive @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , some of our solutions satisfy in addition the heterotic equations of motion .",
    "finally , in section  [ holonomy - cohomology ] we determine the holonomy group of the bismut connection of the solutions found in the previous sections . a cohomological property that involves the cup product by the de rham cohomology class of the 4-form @xmath51 , where @xmath12 is a balanced metric , is also studied .",
    "at the end of section  [ holonomy - cohomology ] a table is included ( see table  1 ) , where the main results of the paper are gathered .",
    "we also include an appendix with the curvature 2-forms @xmath52 of any connection @xmath0 , which are needed for the proofs of the results of sections  [ h3 ] , [ sl2c ] , [ g7 ] and  [ holonomy - cohomology ] .",
    "in this section we introduce a family of metric connections that extends the connections in the canonical 1-parameter family of hermitian connections and also includes other connections which are of interest in the strominger system .",
    "let @xmath53 be a hermitian manifold . a hermitian connection @xmath14 is a linear connection defined on the tangent bundle @xmath54 such that both the metric and the complex structure are parallel , i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "gauduchon introduced in @xcite a 1-parameter family @xmath57 of canonical hermitian connections which are distinguished by the properties of the torsion tensor .",
    "this family is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the associated fundamental @xmath60-form , @xmath61 denotes the torsion of the chern connection @xmath20 , and @xmath62 stands for the torsion @xmath63-form of the bismut connection @xmath21 .",
    "actually , @xmath21 and @xmath20 are recovered when @xmath26 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the family of hermitian connections @xmath57 has been recently considered in @xcite to find solutions to the strominger system , but there are other connections which have also been proposed , as for instance the levi - civita connection @xmath22 and the @xmath23-connection ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "this leads us to consider the following extension of the canonical 1-parameter family of hermitian connections .",
