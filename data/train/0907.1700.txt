    "the critical energy density predicted by lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) for the formation of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) @xcite has been exceeded in central au+au collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite .",
    "some novel phenomena , such as jet - quenching and collective flows @xcite , indicate the dense medium is produced in central au+au collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "a natural subject is to study the properties of the produced medium through the interactions of jets and the medium .    in recent years",
    ", correlations among hadrons has been one of very active subjects , because it is a valuable tool for studying the interactions between jets and the medium produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "measurements of high transverse momentum particle spectra provide the first striking experimental evidence of jet - quenching .",
    "further studies of the correlations among intermediate @xmath4 particles reveal a complex pattern of correlations as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 by star collaboration @xcite , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle relative to the trigger particle , respectively .",
    "similar @xmath5 and @xmath6 correlations have also been observed by the phenix@xcite and the phobos collaboration @xcite . for a brief summary of the experimental discoveries at rhic , see @xcite .",
    "there are several models for the medium response to jets , such as momentum kick model @xcite , markovian parton scattering model @xcite , recombination model @xcite , mach cone @xcite , cerenkov gluon radiation @xcite , jet or shower broadening@xcite , ect , which can explain part of phenomena on the observed jet structure .    in heavy ion collisions , there are near - side and away - side associate - particles for a jet . for the near - side associate - particles , there are ridge and jet components . for the away - side ones",
    ", there exists complex structure which depends on the trigger momentum . in this paper , we present a simple model , similar to the momentum kick model for the ridge formation , for the away - side associate - particles to investigate the di - hadron @xmath6 correlations .",
    "we only focus on the physics origin of double - humped structure for the away - side associate - particles .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we give a brief introduction of our model .",
    "we show our results in section iii .",
    "the last section is for a short conclusion .",
    "in principle , a pair of back - to - back jets can be produced at any points in the medium .",
    "the jets lose their energy during traversing the hot dense medium . considering the trigger bias @xcite , the near - side jets are more likely produced near the surface of the medium . in our model , near - side jets are assumed to emerge on the surface of the medium for simplicity .",
    "so we will not consider the near - side ridge and jet in this paper .",
    "the medium partons and the jets materialize into the observed particles by assuming parton - hadron duality .",
    "we will use the same mechanism as in @xcite for the interactions among jets and the medium partons . between two successive collisions between hard and soft partons ,",
    "the hard parton is assumed to move freely .",
    "the free distance of travelling is assumed to be described by a distribution determined with a mean free path @xmath7 .",
    "so we have two parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath7 , in our model for the characteristic lengths involved .",
    "because our focus is searching for the origin of double - humped structure in @xmath0 on the away - side of jets in heavy ion collisions , the absolute values of the lengths involved are not relevant .",
    "we normalize the medium system radius @xmath9 and the value of mean free path @xmath7 is in unit of @xmath8 .",
    "since only the azimuthal angle of final state particles plays a role , the absolute values of involved momenta have no importance so that we can set the initial hard parton momentum to be @xmath10 and the measure momenta of all other particles in unit of the hard parton momentum",
    ". then one can ask the initial momentum direction of the away - side hard partons at the point where the parton is created . if the pair of hard partons is created in the collision between partons with momentum fraction @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the nucleons , with zero transverse momentum",
    ", the jets will be back to back when @xmath13 .",
    "so generally the produced jets can deviate from back to back . in this paper , we assume that the near - side hard parton moves parallel to the impact parameter , and the angle @xmath14 between the initial moving direction of an away - side hard parton and the impact parameter is assumed to be given by a distribution        @xmath15    the standard deviation is chosen to be @xmath16 .",
    "when this distribution is not used , one can study the case with exact back to back jets in the medium .",
    "more complexity comes from a fact that the creation point of the pair of hard partons may be anywhere on the medium surface . in this paper",
    ", we simplify our study by considering two cases with the hard parton s creation point being at a fixed point or uniformly distributed on the medium surface .",
    "we assume that the medium partons produced in heavy ion collisions have been thermalized , whose momentum satisfies the two - dimensional boltzmann distribution , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the medium parton momentum and @xmath19 is a model parameter .",
    "the mean magnitude of momentum of the medium parton is @xmath20 .",
    "one can sample the thermal momentum @xmath21 of the medium parton by eq .",
    "( [ tmomentum ] ) with random direction .",
    "the transverse flow effect can be considered in our model .",
    "so the medium parton may also have a flow momentum .",
    "we assume the flow momentum is proportional to the position vector , similar to the hubble law @xmath22 where @xmath23 is another model parameter .",
    "then the momentum of a medium parton is the sum of thermal and flow components @xmath24 with a mean free path @xmath7 , we assume that the stepsize @xmath25 between a hard parton s two successive collisions with medium partons fulfills the distribution @xmath26 after traversing @xmath25 the hard parton collides with a medium parton and loses momentum , and the momentum transfer in the collision is assumed as a simple form @xmath27 after each collision , both the hard and medium partons change their moving directions .",
    "if the hard parton momentum is smaller than the the mean thermal momentum , the hard parton is also assumed to materialize into the observed final state particles , otherwise the hard parton keeps on colliding with the medium partons until it runs out the system .",
    "associated with trigger hadrons with @xmath28 .",
    "the data points ( solid dots ) are from phenix collaboration @xcite measured in auau collisions . up",
    "panel : at @xmath29 centrality .",
    "down panel : at @xmath30 centrality .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "in order to search for the origin of double - humped structure in @xmath0 on the away - side , we use monte carlo to simulate the process for an away - side jet going through the medium produced in au+au collisions . there are three physics effects considered here : @xmath31 with / without the flow effect ; @xmath32 with / without the variation of initial position for hard parton pair creation ; @xmath33 with / without the initial momentum direction distribution of hard parton . for simplicity ,",
    "we classify our investigations into two major categories : @xmath31 without flow effect ; @xmath32 with flow effect . for each category , there are four different cases corresponding to different combinations of with / without hard parton variation of creation point and initial moving angle distribution",
    ".    first , let s consider four different cases with no flow effect . in our model , we set @xmath34 to exclude the flow effect .",
    "for all the four choices on the distributions of initial hard parton creation position and the moving direction , we find that the away - side di - hadron azimuthal angle distribution is a single peak on the away - side for different parameter combinations .",
    "so we can conclude that collective flow effect is essential for the double - humped structure .",
    "second , the flow effect is included . when the hard parton is assumed to be generated at a fixed point on the surface of the medium system and its initial momentum",
    "is always directed at @xmath35 , no double - humped structure can be found on the away - side di - hadron azimuthal distribution .",
    "the double - humped structure does appear on the away - side when @xmath31 the hard parton is generated at one point with distributed initial moving direction ; or @xmath32 the hard parton is generated on the semi - circle surface of the collision system on the near - side without diverse initial moving direction .",
    "but the simulated @xmath0 correlation ca nt fit the experimental data well .",
    "when the hard parton is generated on the semi - circle surface of the medium with @xmath14 distribution for the initial moving direction , we can fit the experimental data well with suitably chosen parameters . in fig .",
    "[ central ] shows the di - hadron correlation distribution from our model for the away - side together with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "the best fit corresponds to @xmath36 .",
    "a factor has been multiplied to adjust the magnitude of the distribution .",
    "the dip is around @xmath37 and double humps are at @xmath38 .",
    "the value of @xmath39 means that the mean magnitude of momentum for the medium parton is @xmath40 that for a hard parton .",
    "considering the fact that the mean transverse momentum of medium parton is about @xmath41 , the value of @xmath19 obtained in the fit corresponds to hard parton momentum @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "this result seems reasonable for @xmath44 .    in order to further check the model",
    ", we consider the dependence of di - hadron azimuthal distribution on the centrality .",
    "we apply our model with exactly the same parameters to the semi - central and peripheral au+au collisions with the three physical effects mentioned above .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ semi_peri ] that the corresponding experimental @xmath6 distributions can also be reproduced very well .",
    "also one can observe a transition from a double - humped to single peak structure for the away - side azimuthal distributions for au+au collisions from semi - central to peripheral .",
    "this means that our model can describe the away - side @xmath6 distributions for different colliding centralities .",
    "we have considered a model for the origin of the double - humped structure on the away - side in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we simulated the jet - medium interactions and obtained the di - hadron azimuthal angle correlation .",
    "all of the parameters are fixed by fitting the experimental data for central collisions .",
    "then , we applied our model to the semi - central and peripheral au+au collisions . the corresponding azimuthal distribution on the away - side can also be reproduced very well . from the results",
    ", we can conclude that the transverse flow effect is the main origin of the double - humped structure on the away - side in heavy ion collisions .",
    "another necessary effect for the double - humped structure is due to distributions for the hard parton creation point and/or its initial moving direction .",
    "probably more realistic jet - medium interactions need to be introduced to quantitatively explain the experimental data .",
