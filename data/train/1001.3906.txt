    "the dynamics and emission properties of supercritical ( or super - eddington ) accretion flows have been long - standing issues since the 1970s ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "theoretical studies on supercritical accretion are far from being complete due to the complex interaction between radiation and matter , despite recent progress in numerical simulations ( e.g. ohsuga et al .",
    "2009 ) . from observational studies",
    ", supercritical accretion appears to be present in some extragalactic objects , such as narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) and ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) ( kato et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) . in some nls1s",
    ", the black hole mass can be estimated by means of reverberation mapping ( e.g. wandel et al .",
    "1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) . in the case of ulxs",
    ", however , the black hole mass is unknown and thus remains controversial .",
    "nevertheless , their luminosity is higher than the eddington luminosity of a stellar mass black hole .",
    "black hole mass is the key to initially identifying a supercritical accreting system since the eddington luminosity depends only on the black hole mass . in order to do a comprehensive study on supercritical accretion processes",
    ", we need an object whose black hole mass can be well - constrained .",
    "in addition , we also need adequate observational data .",
    "one of the best objects for the study of supercritical accretion is the galactic microquasar , grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 has been active since its discovery by the watch all - sky x - ray monitor on _ granat _",
    "( @xcite ; 1994 ) on 1992 august 15 .",
    "its distance and inclination angle have been estimated from its super - luminal jets ( @xcite ) to be @xmath14 kpc ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "dozens of types of peculiar variability in the x - rays have been observed ( see @xcite ; klein - wolt et al .",
    "2002 ; hannikainen et al .",
    "2005 ) , most of which have never been observed in other galactic x - ray sources , including other known microquasars .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 is thus known to be a peculiar x - ray source in our galaxy .",
    "the jet feature and the variability of grs 1915 + 105 are believed to be an important key to studying the coupling between jets and accretion disks in general ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    while optical observations are severely hampered since grs 1915 + 105",
    "is located close to the galactic plane at @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xcite ) , observations at other wavelengths prove to be quite fruitful . from infrared spectroscopy , grs 1915 + 105 was suggested to be a low - mass x - ray binary ( @xcite ) .",
    "this result is further supported by greiner et al .",
    "( 2001a ) and they also suggested that the donor star is a k ",
    "m giant with a narrow mass range @xmath18  1.5@xmath19 .",
    "the dynamical mass estimation results in a compact object of @xmath20 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this classifies grs 1915 + 105 as the most massive black hole x - ray binaries ( bhbs ) in our galaxy ( for extragalactic bhbs , see , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "since the dynamical mass can be estimated , grs 1915 + 105 is known to prefer being in a state where the luminosity is close to or even exceeding its eddington luminosity ( @xcite ) , which corresponds to the supercritical accretion process .",
    "provided that grs 1915 + 105 does really exhibit supercritical accretion , it can be used as a guide for the interpretation of other supercritical accreting objects that lack sufficient data for a comprehensive study .",
    "we use archival _ rxte _ data mainly from 1999 to 2000 and apply the so - called disk - corona model to the extracted spectra .",
    "our focus on the study of the supercritical accretion in grs 1915 + 105 distinguishes this work from other previous extensive studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also need to stress that we do not attempt to explain the nature of grs 1915 + 105 with its richness of variability on timescales from years down to milliseconds ( see , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and its non - canonical soft and hard states .",
    "those studies have been done by many authors ( see , e.g. @xcite , b ) and the most recent work can be found in rodriguez et al .",
    "( 2008a , b ) . on the contrary , we choose data from when the source is more or less stable , without strong variability features as classified in belloni et al .",
    "the constraint on the mass of grs 1915 + 105 from dynamical estimates helps us to study the detailed relation between the x - ray spectra and mass accretion rate in terms of its luminosity during its supercritical accretion state .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : we describe our data sample in section 2 , and continue with describing the model and the fitting analysis in section 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the discussion , and finally section 6 concludes the paper . throughout our study",
    "we adopt the following values : a distance of 12 kpc , an inclination angle of 70@xmath21 , and a black hole mass of 14@xmath19 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      our final sample has @xmath22 ranges between 0.7  2 kev while the total luminosity ranges from @xmath23  1.04@xmath1 , where @xmath1 is the eddington luminosity ( @xmath24 erg s@xmath25 ) .",
    "data with @xmath22 within 1.5  2 kev are mostly those with disk - dominated spectra ( see figure 7 , filled stars ) .",
    "the inner disk temperature in our sample is too high for a 14@xmath19 non - rotating black hole .",
    "a rotating black hole is , thus , often suggested to explain a too high disk temperature phenomena in this source ( mcclintock et al .",
    "2006 ; middleton et al . 2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "caution needs to be taken for some comptonization - dominated data .",
    "as shown in table 2 , some of these comptonization - dominated data ( i.e. datasets 16 , 17 , 18 , 20 , 21 , and 23 ) have a very low disk fraction , @xmath26 . in this case , the values of the disk temperature from the fitting become less reliable since the disk contribution is negligible .    the disk inner radius can be derived from the normalization of the mcd model , i.e. , normalization @xmath27})^2 ) \\times \\cos{i}$ ] , where @xmath28 is the distance to the source in kpc and @xmath29 is the inclination angle of the system .",
    "note that @xmath30 is the apparent inner disk radius without relativistic ( @xmath31 ) and spectral hardening factor ( @xmath32 ) corrections .",
    "the true inner radius can be obtained by using the following formula : @xmath33 ( see kubota et al.1998 ) .",
    "that is , when we mention @xmath30 , we refer to the @xmath34 throughout this paper unless stated otherwise .",
    "however , since we use a disk - corona model , we have to take into account the effect of the thermal comptonization in the spectrum .",
    "we calculate the apparent disk inner radius by using the formula ( a1 ) shown in kubota and makishima ( 2004 ) in which spherical geometry is assumed for the thermal comptonization emission .",
    "however , here we assume that half the photons in the corona are injected back into the accretion disk due to the large optical depth , as done in ueda et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .    by using this formula ,",
    "the obtained true inner radius of the disk is mostly within @xmath35  7@xmath36 , where @xmath36 is about 42 km for a 14@xmath19 black hole ( @xmath37 is a schwarzschild radius ) , assuming a non - rotating black hole .",
    "here we have used @xmath38 and @xmath39 to derive these true inner radii .",
    "we find that the data whose disk fraction is larger than 50% of the total component have a low inner disk radius , @xmath40 ( see figure 7 , filled stars ) .",
    "if , however , we choose higher @xmath32 , say @xmath41 ( note that in figure 10 the upper branch in the lower panel coincides with the line of @xmath41 for a non - rotating black hole ) , @xmath30 would range within @xmath42 1.5  22@xmath36 , that is @xmath43 times larger than that of @xmath44 case .",
    "we find a strong correlation between the disk parameters and the fraction of the disk component .",
    "as shown in figure 7 , the inner disk temperature increases as the fraction of the disk component increase .",
    "the inner disk radius follows the opposite trend .",
    "we attempt to interpret this correlation in section 5 .      for consistency ,",
    "when the extended dbb model is used to fit the disk component , we modify the temperature profile of the seed photons in the thermal comptonization model .",
    "that is , the temperature profile is set to be @xmath45 , with @xmath46 ranging from 0.5 to 0.75 , instead of using the mcd temperature profile .",
    "we only fit a group of data in the lower right of color - color diagram ( see figure 3 , red circle ) and dataset 25 from the upper left group ( blue circle ) .",
    "that is , we only choose data with disk - dominated ( or suspected , such as datasets 11 and 12 ) spectra .",
    "we are interested in finding deviations from the standard high / soft state spectra as the luminosity approaches or exceeds the eddington luminosity . in total",
    ", we fit 12 datasets with the extended dbb model+modified thermal comptonization model .",
    "the unfolded spectra and all components of the model are shown in figure 6 .",
    "results of the fits are summarized in table 4 . as shown in table 4 ( and figure 6 )",
    ", the disk fraction of the twelve datasets is mostly larger than 75% .",
    "moreover , disk fraction in datasets 11 and 12 increases significantly and even exceeds the fraction of the thermal comptonization component .",
    "the radial temperature gradient , @xmath46 , is shown in column 3 of table 4 .",
    "we can see that the @xmath46-values tend to deviate from 0.75 .",
    "in fact , nine out of twelve datasets ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 19 , and 25 ) prefer a @xmath46-value which is less than 0.7 with less than 20% error . moreover , four out of the nine datasets ( 3 , 4 , 11 , 25 ) prefer a @xmath46-value which is less than 0.6 with less than 10% error .",
    "the disk temperature of most datasets tends to increase compared to those of the mcd+thermal comptonization model , that is @xmath47  2.1 kev .      here",
    "we will only focus on two important parameters from the thermal comptonization model that we use in our present study .",
    "these parameters are the electron temperature , @xmath48 , and the power - law photon index , @xmath49 .",
    "the electron temperature determines the high energy rollover . in addition , the low energy rollover is also considered and is parametrized by the seed photon temperature . in our present study , this seed photon temperature is equal to the inner disk temperature .",
    "the power - law photon index determines the slope between low and high energy rollovers .",
    "we will first describe the results for the case where the disk component is modeled by mcd .",
    "with some few exceptions , data with @xmath2 disk fraction prefer low electron temperature below 10 kev ( see figure 8 , filled stars ) .",
    "we , however , set the maximum limit at 25 kev for the electron temperature since , otherwise , it can not be constrained by our data in some cases .",
    "it is important to note here that the error estimate for the electron temperature is , unlike other parameters , quite large . in other words",
    ", we should be very careful in making an interpretation based on the electron temperature results .",
    "the power - law photon index varies between 2  5 for most data regardless of the disk fraction . despite its relatively small errors ,",
    "no clear trend is found which left no room for further speculation ( see figure 8) .    in figure 9 , the electron scattering optical depth , @xmath50 is calculated from @xmath51 and @xmath49 by following sunyaev and titarchuk ( 1980 ) : @xmath52}}-1.5.\\ ] ] the lines show constant @xmath53 , 2.5 , 3 , 3.5 , 4 , and 4.5 , from top to bottom .",
    "all data prefer an electron scattering optical depth between 1 and 10 , mostly greater than 2 .    in the case where the disk component is modeled by extended dbb",
    ", the electron temperatures tend to be higher but mostly still less than 10 kev , in agreement with those of the mcd fits ( see tables 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the power - law photon index , @xmath49 , remains within the same range as those of the mcd fits although the values are not always similar .",
    "we conclude that both the mcd and the extended dbb model prefer low temperatures ( @xmath54 kev ) and thus optically thick ( @xmath55 ) corona ( since @xmath49 values do not vary so much ) .",
    "one of the most general properties of accreting black hole systems is that they follow a @xmath56 -track ( see , e.g. gierliski and done 2004 ) in a luminosity versus inner disk temperature diagram ( an x - ray hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram ) during the high / soft state ( i.e. when the disk component dominates the soft x - ray spectrum ) .",
    "this property means that as the disk temperature and luminosity change , the inner radius of the disk remains constant ( makishima et al . 1986 ; ebisawa et al .",
    "1991 ; dotani et al . 1997",
    "; kubota et al .",
    "thus , the inner disk radius is often related to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) which in turn can be related to the black hole mass .    however , as the luminosity of the system approaches its eddington luminosity , it starts to depart from the @xmath56 -track .",
    "some systems , indeed , have shown that they start to follow a new flatter track of @xmath57 ( kubota and makishima 2004 ) , which satisfies the slim disk prediction for a non - rotating black hole .",
    "figure 10 shows the x - ray hr diagram of our sample .",
    "here we use @xmath8 instead of @xmath58 , but as long as we consider a constant spectral hardening factor , @xmath32 , @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath60-axis of the upper panel shows the total luminosity ( @xmath7 ) , obtained by summing the luminosity of the disk component ( @xmath61 ) and thermal comptonization component ( @xmath62 ) , normalized by the eddington luminosity .",
    "the lower panel shows the disk luminosity normalized by the eddington luminosity .",
    "the disk luminosity is calculated from the unabsorbed flux of mcd component between 0.01  100 kev assuming a disk geometry , a distance of 12.5 kpc , and an inclination angle of 70@xmath21 .",
    "we assume an isotropic emission when we calculate the thermal comptonization luminosity ( also shown in table 3 ) .",
    "the filled stars show data with @xmath2 disk fraction in their spectra , while open squares represent the data with lower disk fraction ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "data with @xmath64 are not shown in the lower panel for clarity .",
    "it is not always clear which luminosity ( @xmath7 or @xmath61 ) is better for this kind of plot . in the present study",
    "we plot both luminosities for completeness . in disk - dominated data ,",
    "the disk fraction is moderately higher than that of the thermal comptonization component and thus both luminosities give similar results .",
    "by contrast , for comptonization - dominated data , their position in the x - ray hr diagram depends on the choice of luminosity , @xmath7 or @xmath61 ( compare upper and lower panels of figure 10 ) .",
    "as shown in the upper panel , these data have comparable total luminosities to those of disk - dominated data . however , their disk fraction is mostly low and thus their position is shifted to a lower position in the lower panel of figure 10 .",
    "data with a very low disk fraction ( @xmath65 ) do not follow the @xmath66-track in the lower panel .",
    "moreover , the disk temperature value obtained from fitting becomes less reliable since the disk contribution is almost negligible ( see section 4.1.1 ) .    from the lower panel of figure 10",
    ", we can see that there are two groups of data following two different @xmath66-tracks .",
    "the upper branch seems to extend to the lower disk luminosity data ( open squares ) but these data are those whose spectra are dominated by the thermal comptonization .",
    "all spectra of the data in the lower branch are disk - dominated and their disk luminosity is below 0.5@xmath1 .",
    "the lower branch may correspond to the highest end of standard accretion disk branch in the high / soft state or slim - disk state ( see below ) .    in figure 10 , we also plot some lines from equation [ 9 ] of makishima et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , assuming @xmath67 erg s@xmath25 .",
    "it is assumed that the inner edge of the disk reaches the isco , @xmath68 for a non - rotating black hole and @xmath69 for a maximally rotating black hole .",
    "given that we know the black hole mass from dynamical methods , @xmath70 , we can plot the lines for different values of @xmath32 , by assuming a value of black hole spin .",
    "in figure 10 , we assume a black hole spin of 0 ( non - rotating black hole ) .",
    "these lines of constant @xmath32 coincide with @xmath71 -tracks .",
    "the upper and lower branches , in the lower panel of figure 10 , coincide with @xmath72 and 4 for a non - rotating black hole , respectively .",
    "figure 11 shows the x - ray hr diagram for both mcd ( blue points ) and extended dbb fits ( red points ) .",
    "the blue open squares and filled stars are comptonization - dominated and disk - dominated data , respectively .",
    "red filled circles are those datasets with @xmath73 from extended dbb fits , while red open circles are those with @xmath74",
    ". we also plot the fitting results of two datasets from numerical simulations of the slim disk model around a rotating black hole ( sadowski 2009 ) in blue open diamonds .",
    "the higher temperature data corresponds to a black hole spin of 0.99 while the lower temperature to a black hole spin of 0.52 .",
    "relativistic effects are also included when calculating the spectrum and the spectral hardening factor is 1.7 ( sadowski et al .",
    "we draw lines that cross each numerical simulation point ( blue open diamond ) assuming @xmath71 in orange and green .",
    "it turns out that the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 becomes less unclear because of the limited range of @xmath8 .",
    "caution needs to be taken , however , since the luminosity calculation from the observed flux for the extended dbb model is less reliable than that of the mcd model because the disk state is expected to become the standard one and hence @xmath46 should change to 0.75 at outer radii .",
    "rather , we can directly compare our mcd fit results ( blue points ) with the same plot obtained from other bhbs ( e.g. figure  5 of kubota and makishima 2004 ) , where the @xmath75-track is suggested at the highest temperature end based on the mcd model .",
    "grs 1915 + 105 is known to be the only source in our galaxy that persistently shines at above 10% of its eddington luminosity .",
    "it raises a doubt on whether we ever observed the canonical high / soft state even when the disk fraction is large .",
    "we also found a puzzling behavior from our present study . in this section",
    "we will discuss our interpretation as well as explore the available scenarios for this puzzling behavior at near - eddington luminosity .      as shown in figure 7",
    ", there is a clear dependence of the mcd fitting components , i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath22 on the disk fraction . as the disk fraction increases from 0 to 50% , the innermost temperature of the disk increases as the radius decreases .",
    "it is also shown that @xmath30 remains almost constant for those datasets with disk fraction larger than 50% .",
    "we suggest that the comptonization - dominated spectra most probably correspond to the ( strong ) very high state ( vhs ) found in other bhbs , because of the similarity in : ( 1 ) the parameters of comptonization ( @xmath761020 kev and @xmath77 23 ) , ( 2 ) the high @xmath78 value , ( 3 ) the ( apparently ) large @xmath30 ( or high @xmath7 ) for the given @xmath8 , and ( 4 ) the presence of strong ( low frequency ) qpos ( e.g. morgan et al .",
    "1997 ; rodriguez et al . 2004 ) .",
    "these are exactly found in the strong vhs of xte  j1550564 , although the real innermost radius may be smaller if the disk - corona coupling is taken into account ( done and kubota 2006 ) .",
    "this vhs occurs when the mass accretion rate becomes even higher than that of the high / soft state .",
    "theoretically , some outflow material blown off the disk due to the increase of radiation pressure caused by the increase of mass accretion rate is also predicted in this state .",
    "it is very unlikely that the comptonization - dominated spectra correspond to the canonical low / hard state of bhbs , which is normally observed at luminosities much lower than 10% of the eddington luminosity , unlike our case .",
    "in addition , the electron temperature of the comptonizing corona in the low / hard state ( e.g. makishima et al . 2008 ) is much higher ( @xmath42100 kev ) than those found here .",
    "we propose that the following three branches ( states ) have been observed in our data sample :    1 .",
    "comptonization - dominated spectra ( when the disk flux @xmath79 of the total flux ) , which correspond to the strong vhs in other bhbs .",
    "[ 1 ] 2 .",
    "disk - dominated spectra : 1 .",
    "lower luminosity branch : the high / soft state , or probably the slim disk state , around a rotating black hole ( see next subsection ) .",
    "[ a ] 2 .",
    "higher luminosity branch : probably a truncated disk with low temperature ( @xmath6 kev ) and optically thick comptonization .",
    "this would correspond to the new state that appears at luminosity very close to the eddington luminosity .",
    "it may be understood as the extension of the high electron temperature vhs ( state 1 above ) when luminosity becomes higher .",
    "[ b ] + [ 2 ]    state ( 1 ) and ( 2a ) have already been observed in other bhbs , but state ( 2b ) looks unique in grs 1915 + 105 , probably due to its high @xmath78 .",
    "the disk - dominated spectra ( state 2 ) will be discussed in more detail in the following subsection .",
    "the cartoon of these three branches in the x - ray hr diagram is shown in figure 12 , which corresponds to the upper panel of figure 10 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath75-track does not appear in the disk - dominated branches even when the luminosity approaches and even exceeds the eddington limit contradicts the theoretical predictions of slim disk model for a non - rotating black hole .",
    "moreover , as shown in the lower panel of figure 10 , a high value of the spectral hardening factor , @xmath80 is required by the data in the lower branch assuming a non - rotating black hole . the higher value of @xmath32 compared to the standard value commonly used for the standard case @xmath44 may be related to the increase in the mass accretion rate .",
    "beloborodov ( 1998 ) has calculated the disk structure of a rapidly rotating black hole with a super - eddington accretion rate .",
    "the calculations show that when the viscosity is high and the mass accretion rate approaches the critical value , a strong deviation from equilibrium occurs in the inner region of the disk . in this region ,",
    "the plasma density is low and thus emission capability is also low .",
    "the produced radiation in the disk is thus not fully thermalized which results in higher disk temperature which further can be related to higher value of @xmath32 .",
    "the question remains , however , since the luminosity of the lower branch , whose @xmath32 is higher , is lower than that of the upper branch .",
    "we may have underestimated the luminosity of the lower branch .",
    "for example , if some part of the disk is obscured by highly ionized outflow materials which scatter disk radiation . in the case when the outflow has a small opening angle , we should have overestimated the luminosity due to high inclination angle of grs 1915 + 105 and not the other way around .",
    "if , however , we have a moderately geometrically thick disk ( slim disk ) together with an outflow , there may be some interaction between the disk and the outflow and complicate the radiation track .",
    "the material outflow from the disk is a delicate process which far from being understood .",
    "we need a numerical calculation of disk - corona system with an outflow for further analysis .",
    "kawashima et al . (",
    "2009 ) performed two dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of supercritical accretion flows with outflows .",
    "they found a possible new state above the slim disk state in which both disk and outflow components become important .",
    "the slim disk and outflow model seems to be applicable in a particular case of ulxs ( gladstone et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "high inner disk temperatures found in our study may be explained by a slim disk around a non - rotating black hole ( e.g. watarai et al .",
    "2000 ) , a standard disk around a rotating black hole ( e.g. zhang et al . 1997 ) , or a slim disk around a rotating black hole ( e.g. sadowski 2009 ) . as mentioned above",
    ", the non existence of @xmath75-track and the too high @xmath32 value contradict the theoretical prediction of the slim disk around a non - rotating black hole .",
    "while the rotating black hole is a good explanation for the high inner disk temperatures ( since the inner disk radius becomes closer to the black hole ) , the luminosities of our sample are too high to keep the disk in the standard accretion mode .",
    "on the other hand , a clear deviation from the standard accretion disk spectra during the high / soft state as luminosity approaches the eddington luminosity is in a good agreement with slim disk prediction .",
    "slim disk around a rotating black hole is one plausible idea to resolve the above issues since the @xmath75 -track is not necessarily held for the following reason .    in the case of a disk around a non - rotating black hole",
    ", there is a gap between the radius of the isco ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) and that of the event horizon ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "as the mass accretion rate increases , the flow density inside the isco increases and eventually fills the gap , emitting significant radiation .",
    "hence , substantial radiation will be emitted from there at luminosities near the eddington .",
    "this results in an apparent decrease of the inner edge of the disk and increase of the innermost disk temperature with an increase of the mass accretion rate ( and luminosity ) , in the way that @xmath83 .",
    "this leads to the relation , @xmath84 ( watarai et al .",
    "this can not happen for a maximally rotating black hole , since the isco is located near the event horizon , regardless of the mass accretion rate .",
    "hence , the relation , @xmath75 , will never appear .",
    "furthermore , if we assume a rapidly rotating black hole , we do not need to adopt too high spectral hardening factor for the data in the lower branch of figure 11 ( lower panel ) .",
    "provided that the spin parameter does not change , the nature of the upper branch remains unclear .",
    "one possible explanation is the change of spectral hardening factor despite the unknown mechanism .",
    "another possible explanation is the effect of the strong comptonization .",
    "the inner disk is truncated and turns into comptonizing corona , which is suggested as a picture of the vhs of normal bhbs , and thus we observed lower inner disk temperature than expected from high / soft state at the same luminosity ( done and kubota 2006 ) .",
    "the fact that the upper branch in our study has never been observed in other galactic microquasar , such as xte j1550564 and gro j165540 ( e.g. kubota et al . 2001 ; 2004 ) , may have something to do with the spin parameter . both xte j1550564 and gro j165540",
    "are suggested to have a moderate spin parameter @xmath85 ( e.g. gierliski et al . 2001 ; davis et al .",
    "2006 ; shafee et al .",
    "caution needs to be taken since there are several methods in determining spin parameter which can lead to contradicting results . in the case of gro j1655 - 40 , for example ,",
    "reis et al . ( 2009 ) obtained a lower limit for the spin of 0.9 by using the reflection component in the spectrum . at present",
    ", there is no consensus on the best methods to determine the black hole spin parameter . despite the fact that our present study does not focus on the determination of the spin parameter , our results suggest a rapidly rotating black hole for grs 1915 + 105 .",

    "( 2006 ) find a spin parameter @xmath86 for grs 1915 + 105 from their analysis .",
    "they also find that the spin decreases as the luminosity increases .",
    "they , however , choose only data with @xmath87 to determine the spin parameter .",
    "the spin parameters obtained from data with @xmath88 , are indeed in agreement with the moderate spin parameter obtained by middleton et al.(2006 ) , spin parameter @xmath89 .",
    "middleton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , however , due to their selection criteria , have only a restricted data sample which contains only high luminosity data , @xmath88 . comparing the disk luminosities and temperatures obtained from both middleton et al.(2006 ) and mcclintock et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , data of middleton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) seem to correspond to our higher branch , while those of mcclintock et al .",
    "( 2006 ) with @xmath87 correspond to the lower branch in our x - ray hr diagram .",
    "we analyzed the spectra of grs 1915 + 105 during its quasi - steady states to study the supercritical accretion processes .",
    "we found new interesting features as follows :    1 .",
    "there is a strong dependence of the inner disk temperature and radius on the fraction of the disk component : the disk temperature increases as the disk fraction increases , while the opposite trend is found for the inner disk radius .",
    "the electron temperature tends to be higher when the disk fraction is small while the spectral slope remains more or less constant . [ 1 ] 2 .",
    "we also fit the data with the extended dbb model to see any deviation from the standard spectral shape . despite the fact that the @xmath46-value deviates from the standard value @xmath90 for data with @xmath91 , the @xmath75-track predicted by the slim disk theory for a non - rotating black hole does not appear .",
    "a rapid spin of the black hole in grs 1915 + 105 can explain these features as well as a high value of spectral hardening factor ( @xmath13 ) that would be required for a non - rotating black hole .",
    "[ 2 ] 3 .",
    "we observed three spectral branches ( states ) in our data sample : one comptonization - dominated branch and two disk- dominated branches .",
    "we suggest that comptonization - dominated spectra correspond to the canonical vhs observed in normal bhbs .",
    "the lower luminosity branch of disk - dominated spectra seems to correspond to the highest end of the high / soft state or the slim disk state around a rotating black hole .",
    "the higher luminosity branch of disk - dominated spectra may be interpreted as a truncated disk with low temperature and optically thick comptonization , unique to grs 1915 + 105 at near eddington luminosity .
