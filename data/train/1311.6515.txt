    "radio studies of the remnant show an incomplete , small diameter ( @xmath205@xmath21 ) , shell characterized by a steep spectral index ( @xmath22 @xmath20 0.68 ) , a flux density of 6  jy at 1  ghz , and with no detection of the central compact source with a flux limit @xmath23 @xmath24 0.45 mjy and @xmath25 @xmath24 0.60 mjy ( green 2009 ; kriss et al .",

    "the infrared emission originating from the snr with an estimated dust mass of 0.11  @xmath19 has been explained by pinheiro goncalves et al .",
    "( 2011 ) as likely due to grains heated by collisions in the hot plasma , while carey et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggested that the 24 @xmath26 m emission may be mostly due to nebular emission lines such as [ o iv ] ( 25.89 @xmath26 m ) and [ fe ii ] ( 25.99 @xmath26 m ) with a small contribution to the continuum emission from dust produced in the remnant .",
    "the snr kes  73/axp system was previously observed and studied using many x - ray observatories including _ einstein _ , _ rosat _ , _ asca _ , _ chandra _ , and _ xmm - newton_. the _ asca _ spectrum was described by a thermal bremsstrahlung model with @xmath27 @xmath20 0.6  kev plus gaussian emission lines with evidence for enhanced mg , and possibly o and ne , abundances , with the snr age estimated to be @xmath282000  years ( gotthelf & vasisht 1997 ) .",
    "observation of the snr was briefly studied by morii et al .",
    "( 2010 ) in connection with the _ suzaku _ studies of axp  1e  1841@xmath0045 , where the entire snr spectrum was modeled by a vsedov model .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ study of the remnant was performed by vink & kuiper ( 2006 ) using the mos data .",
    "they fitted the spectrum using either a two - component non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model under the spex fitting package ( kaastra & mewe 2000 ) or a one - component vsedov model , both of which yielded solar metal abundances .",
    "their study , primarily targeted to determine the supernova explosion energy , argued against the millisecond proto - neutron star model for magnetar formation .",
    "recently , lopez et al . (",
    "2011 ) also reported x - ray results on kes  73 as part of a survey study aimed at typing snrs using their x - ray morphology as well as to set observational constraints on the hydrodynamical models .",
    "their study , which made use of one of the available _ chandra _ observations of kes  73 , yielded a mean temperature of @xmath27 = 0.84 @xmath16 0.49  kev using a one - component vpshock model and detected enhanced abundances from mg , si , and s for some of the small scale regions extracted from within the remnant .",
    "the above mentioned x - ray studies lack a detailed imaging and spectroscopic analysis of the remnant using all available data . hence , in the following work , we extend the earlier studies to include multi - wavelength data and in particular , the previously unpublished _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "we provide a detailed x - ray imaging - spectroscopic analysis to investigate the snr s multi - wavelength morphology ( radio , infrared , and x - rays ) , map the spectral parameters across the remnant , revisit the supernova explosion properties , and address the mass of its progenitor star .",
    "the latter goal is motivated by addressing the nature of the progenitors and the environment of highly magnetized neutron stars ( with a surface dipole magnetic field",

    "kes  73 is one of only a few snrs associated with high-@xmath29 pulsars .",
    "the x - ray emission from its associated axp , the slowest ( @xmath31 = 11.8 s ) known magnetar with a characteristic age of @xmath204.7  kyr , was first decoupled from the diffuse emission from the snr using _ asca _ ( helfand et al . 1994 ; gotthelf & vasisht 1997 ) .",
    "this source has been manifesting itself as a quiescent magnetar since the time of its discovery until recently , when it exhibited the first magnetar - like burst caught by the _ swift _ x - ray observatory ( beardmore et al . 2010 ; kumar & safi - harb 2010 ) followed by a few more bursts ( lin et al .",

    "the coordinates and the sizes of the extracted regions are summarized in table  2 and shown in figure  2 .",
    "the source regions , marked by the green ellipses , were selected in such a way that the entire diffuse emission from within the remnant could be explored thoroughly .",

    "the background was selected from a nearby source - free region to the northeast of the snr on the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ chips and is shown by the cyan - colored dashed ellipse in figure  2 .",
    "we further note here that the spectral fits for all small - scale regions were explored with different backgrounds ( northwest and southwest regions near the snr , and the snr annular ring ) and binning , and the spectral parameters obtained were consistent with those shown in table  3 . in order to study the global snr properties",
    ", we extracted the whole snr region of radius 150@xmath34 with the emission from the pulsar and other point sources removed .",
    "this is shown in figure  2 , where the global snr encloses the area inside the dashed cyan - colored annulus and the background extends from 150@xmath34180@xmath34 .",
    "for the _ xmm - newton _ data , to maximize the snr signal while minimizing any contamination by the axp s spectrum , we excluded a circle centered at the axp with a radius of 25@xmath34 .",
    "we have investigated any possible contamination of the snr s spectrum by the axp s spectrum ( especially in the hard x - ray band where its emission dominates ) and found that it is negligible .",
    "in particular , we checked the pulsar s spectrum out to a larger radius of @xmath2035@xmath34 ( which encompasses more than 90% of the encircled energy for a point source ) and found that the additional axp flux ( within 25@xmath3435@xmath34 ) is negligible in comparison to the snr s flux , with a relative axp to snr hard ( 410 kev ) x - ray flux of only @xmath202% , which is within the error on the estimated snr flux .",
    "furthermore , the small - scale inner snr regions extracted closest to the pulsar are at a radius @xmath3735 \" , implying no contamination of these regions spectra by the axp .",
    "all the extracted spectra were analyzed using the x - ray spectral fitting package , xspec version 12.6.0 , and were grouped by a minimum of 25 and 50 counts per bin for regions 19 and the global snr , respectively .",
    "the errors quoted are at the 90@xmath38 confidence level .",
    "the spectra extracted from different regions within the snr clearly showed the presence of line features .",
    "hence , we started analyzing the emission from the remnant using thermal models of varying abundances .",
    "these include collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) models such as vmekal ( mewe et al . 1985 ; liedahl et al . 1995 ) and vraymond ( raymond & smith 1977 ) used for modeling snrs with optically thin thermal plasma that has reached collisional ionization equilibrium , and nei models such as vpshock , vnei , and vsedov ( borkowski et al .",
    "2001 ) appropriate for modeling young snrs in which the plasma is still being ionized .",
    "we find that the spectral analysis using cie models did not yield acceptable fits ( reduced chi - squared @xmath39 @xmath40 2 where @xmath41 is the number of degrees of freedom ) while the nei models with varying metal abundances resulted in much better fits .",
    "vpshock is a plane - parallel non - equilibrium ionization plasma model with variable abundances , characterized by a constant electron temperature and a range of ionization timescales from 0 to @xmath42 = @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the post - shock electron density and @xmath45 is the time since the passage of the shock .",
    "the vnei model also assumes variable abundances , but is characterized by a constant temperature and a single ionization parameter .",
    "vsedov is another nei model with variable abundances based on the sedov self - similar dynamics ( sedov 1959 ) .",
    "this model is characterized by mean and electron temperatures immediately behind the shock and by the ionization timescale .",

    "as mentioned earlier , kes  73 has been classified as a shell - type remnant in the radio ( kriss et al .",
    "now , we compare the radio and x - ray morphologies of the remnant and observe a few similarities .",
    "the remnant exhibits a spherical morphology with the western limb ( which has the highest @xmath160 and lowest @xmath12 ) appearing the brightest in both wavelengths , possibly due to some local density enhancements in that region .",
    "the radio shell extending from the eastern limb to the southern edge of the snr matches with the corresponding quarter shell - like structure ( i.e. , regions  4 and 5 in figure  2 ) observed in the x - ray image , thus appearing purple in figure  5 ( bottom ) .",
    "the enhanced si and s abundances obtained from the spectral fits ( table  3 ) also suggest the presence of reverse shocked ejecta in these regions .",
    "we also notice some faint radio clumps on the northern side of the snr spatially correlating with the x - ray image .",
    "apart from these few similarities , the remnant s morphology also differs in these wavelengths with the apparent lack of bright radio emission from the snr interior and the pulsar ( as expected due to the nature of their emission ) .",
    "the radio shell appears more extended on the northeastern side of the snr and displays a thin filamentary structure along the edges in pure red ( figure  5 ) .",
    "this feature is probably the expanding outer blast wave , which is not detected in x - rays . in summary ,",
    "we see more diffuse x - ray emission originating from the center of the snr due to the reverse shocked ejecta and filling the radio shell , as seen from the blue color at the snr interior in figure  5 ( bottom ) .    the _ spitzer _ mips image ( figure  5 , top right ) reveals a morphology more comparable to that of the x - ray image with arc - like features and bright infrared emission filling the snr",
    ". the western limb of the snr is very bright in the infrared as well , precisely outlining the radio and x - ray emission , and so appears white in the multi - wavelength image of kes  73 .",
    "the interior structures partially coincide with the x - ray image , but no significant infrared emission is seen from the northeastern boundary of the snr .",
    "the infrared image shows that the remnant lies in a complex region of the galactic plane , as previously noted by other authors ( e.g. , wachter et al . 2007 ) , with several saturated foreground or background sources , appearing in green .",
    "pinheiro goncalves et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also suggested a strong morphological association of the 24 @xmath26 m infrared emission and x - ray emission in snr kes  73 , although it is not clear whether the strong 24 @xmath26 m emission is the result of line emission or hot dust .",
    "we discuss here the origin of the soft and hard components derived from our spectral fits .",
    "our spatially resolved spectroscopic study confirms the need for a two - component thermal model to describe the x - ray emission originating from the small scale diffuse emission regions . as discussed in section  4.2 , the soft component , with plasma temperatures @xmath200.30.5  kev , shows enhanced metal abundances while the hard component , with plasma temperatures @xmath201.11.7  kev , is characterized by solar abundances ( except for a slightly higher fe@xmath63 for some regions ) .",
    "these results indicate that the soft component arises primarily from the reverse shocked ejecta and the hard component is dominated by emission from the forward shock .",
    "furthermore , the soft component has reached ionization equilibrium ( @xmath141 @xmath18  10@xmath142  @xmath76  s ) for most of the regions as opposed to the under - ionized plasma ( @xmath74 @xmath20 ( 0.53.2)@xmath310@xmath75  @xmath76  s ) characterizing the hard component .",
    "interestingly , the results we obtained for kes  73 are also very similar to those obtained for the mixed - morphology remnant 3c 397 ( safi - harb et al .",
    "in particular , 3c 397 also needed a two - component model to fit the x - ray emission from all small scale regions , with the hard component showing a lower ionization timescale while the soft component was closer to ionization equilibrium . as well , the soft component was dominated by ejecta requiring enhanced abundances while the hard component showed solar abundances except for fe@xmath63 and was interpreted as the presence of reverse shocked fe bubbles ( safi - harb et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , the abundance of fe@xmath63 in kes  73 is only marginally enhanced unlike in 3c 397 whose spectrum is characterized by a very strong fe - k line not detected in kes  73 .",
    "as mentioned above , we detect enhanced metal abundances in the soft spectral component ( see table  3 ) .",
    "s appears to be highly enhanced across the remnant followed by si ( for regions  1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , and 9 ) .",
    "mg and o seem slightly enhanced for regions  1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "fe@xmath135 is seen enhanced only for region  1 while fe@xmath63 is slightly enhanced for regions  1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 .",
    "most notably , the western and eastern x - ray limbs of the remnant ( regions  1 and 5 ) exhibit very similar spectral properties ( although @xmath160 appears slightly higher for the brighter region  1 ) with elevated and comparable si and s abundances .",
    "the emission from these regions correlates well with their radio counterpart and appears to fall within the outermost radio shell , the red emission seen along the outer edges in figure  6 ( bottom ) .",
    "these regions likely represent the reverse shocked ejecta seen in x - rays .",
    "the outermost fainter region seen in the radio image , which most likely corresponds to the forward shock , is not clearly detected in x - rays . in summary , we observe enhanced si and s abundances for all regions across the remnant suggesting the presence of ejecta .      in the following",

    "observational studies show that several magnetars are associated with star clusters and by studying their association with these clusters , it is possible to estimate the initial mass of their progenitors . a recent study by clark et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , on the discovery of a third massive rsg cluster ( rsgc3 ) located at the base of the scutum - crux arm , suggests that the snr kes  73 could be physically associated with the rsgc13 star formation complex with the location of 1e  1841@xmath0045 approximately equidistant from the rsg clusters 2 and 3 .",
    "therefore , they speculate that the progenitor mass of 1e  1841@xmath0045 can not be @xmath4020@xmath307 by associating the axp with the star formation that yielded rsgc13 . together with another study performed by davies et al .",
    "( 2009 ) which reported a low mass progenitor star of 17 @xmath16 2@xmath307 for the soft gamma repeater ( sgr ) 1900 + 14 , these authors suggest that magnetars do not necessarily descend from massive progenitors .",
    "however , as mentioned above , based on our x - ray spectroscopic analysis as well as the nucleosynthesis yield models used here for comparison , we estimate a massive progenitor @xmath4020@xmath307 for kes  73 .",
    "next , we compare the estimated progenitor mass for kes  73 to that determined for a few other magnetars and high - magnetic field radio pulsars .",
    "the progenitor masses of sgr 180620 associated with the cluster ci 180620 , cxou j164710.2455216 associated with the cluster westerlund 1 ( wd 1 ) , and the axp 1e 1048.15937 were estimated as 48@xmath308 @xmath19 ( bibby et al .",
    "2008 ) , 40 @xmath16 5 @xmath19 ( muno et al .",
    "2006 ) , and 3040 @xmath19 ( gaensler et al . 2005 ) , respectively .",
    "the progenitor masses obtained for the two high - b pulsars ( j11196127 and j18460258 ) also suggests massive progenitors .",
    "the x - ray spectroscopic study of snr g292.20.5 associated with the high - b radio and x - ray pulsar j11196127 suggests a progenitor mass @xmath2030 @xmath19 ( kumar et al .",
    "the snr kes 75 , associated with the high - magnetic field x - ray pulsar j18460258 ( which recently showed magnetar - like bursts and spectral softening ; gavriil et al .",
    "2008 ; kumar & safi - harb 2008 ) , was suggested to have a wolf - rayet progenitor ( morton et al .",
    "2007 ) . in summary ,",
    "the above mentioned studies imply a range of progenitor masses for the highly magnetized neutron stars , with the majority implying very massive progenitors .",
    "however , any conclusion on the factors deciding the origin and evolutionary properties of these sources requires further studies in x - rays and other wavelengths . in particular , in the x - rays , future high - resolution spectroscopic studies are needed to obtain accurate abundance measurements and to perform plasma diagnostics of the individual lines to confirm the temperature of the ejecta as well as that inferred for the interstellar / circumstellar environment in which kes  73 is expanding .",
    "in this paper , we have performed the first detailed imaging and spectral analysis of the snr kes  73 , using all archival _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data , to determine the intrinsic properties of the supernova explosion and the physical properties of the remnant .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    1 .   the high resolution x - ray images confirm a spherical morphology of @xmath205@xmath35 size with several clumpy and knotty structures , and bright diffuse emission originating from the snr interior .",
    "the multi - wavelength morphology of the remnant in the radio , infrared , and x - rays shows the western limb to be much brighter than all other regions .",
    "the infrared image spatially correlates well with the x - ray image while the radio shell appears to extend slightly beyond the x - ray emission and displays a thin filamentary feature along the edges , which likely represents the location of the forward shock .",
    "the spectra obtained from different diffuse emission regions are best fit with a vpshock+vpshock model .",
    "the western limb of the snr showed a slightly higher column density given by @xmath160 = 3.3@xmath48@xmath310@xmath4  @xmath5 .",
    "the soft component is dominated by enhanced metal abundances mainly for si and s in all the regions , with plasma temperatures of 0.30.5  kev and ionization timescales @xmath3710@xmath142",
    "@xmath76  s ( except for regions  2 and 7 ) .",
    "the hard component is dominated by solar abundances , with plasma temperatures of 1.11.7  kev and ionization timescales of ( 0.53.2)@xmath310@xmath75  @xmath76  s. this indicates that the soft component plasma for most regions has reached ionization equilibrium earlier than the plasma associated with the hard component .",
    "3 .   the global x - ray emission from kes  73 is best described by a two - component vsedov+vpshock model , with a column density @xmath160 = 2.6@xmath2@xmath310@xmath4  @xmath5 and the soft and hard components characterized by plasma temperatures of 0.5@xmath11 kev ( @xmath141 @xmath37 6.1@xmath310@xmath142  @xmath76  s ) and 1.6@xmath13 kev ( @xmath74 = 0.8@xmath57 @xmath3 10@xmath75  @xmath76  s ) , respectively .",
    "the presence of enhanced abundances in the soft component suggests that this component is dominated by shock - heated ejecta , while the hard component characterized mostly by solar abundances is dominated by shocked interstellar / circumstellar material .",
    "we have also refined the snr age ranging between 750  @xmath175 yr for the free expansion phase ( assuming an expansion velocity of 5000 km  s@xmath9 ) and 2100  @xmath175  yr assuming a sedov phase of evolution .",
    "the sedov phase yields a shock velocity of ( 1.2 @xmath16 0.3)@xmath310@xmath17  km  s@xmath9 , an explosion energy of @xmath264 = 3.0@xmath14@xmath310@xmath269  ergs , and a swept - up mass of 16@xmath309  m@xmath251 under the assumption of an explosion in a uniform ambient medium . considering kes  73",
    "to be still expanding into the dense wind of its late phase rsg evolution , we infer a shock velocity of ( 1.6@xmath160.7)@xmath310@xmath262  km  s@xmath9 , an age of 2.6@xmath160.6  @xmath175  kyr , and explosion energy @xmath264 = ( 1.1@xmath310@xmath310@xmath301  @xmath197@xmath289  ergs .",
    "these derived values are consistent with the predictions of a very massive progenitor for kes  73 .",
    "4 .   although the abundances are not well - constrained , the abundance ratios , when compared to core - collapse nucleosynthesis models , suggest a progenitor mass @xmath1820@xmath311 for kes  73 . a much deeper exposure with existing x - ray missions , and high - resolution spectroscopy with the soft x - ray spectrometer of _ astro - h _ ( takahashi et al .",
    "2012 ) , are needed for an accurate measurement of the abundances and shock velocities , and to further motivate the development of the existing nucleosynthesis models .",
