    "in nanofabrication , it is an ongoing challenge to characterize the structure of a real sample , in particular of three - dimensional ( 3d ) materials  @xcite .",
    "this challenge holds notably for nanophotonic metamaterials whose properties and functionality are determined by their complex structure with feature sizes @xmath0 comparable to , or even smaller than the wavelength of light : @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "these classes of nanomaterials are from necessarily opaque , hence current high - resolution optical microscopy techniques have insufficient penetration depth , apart from the usual resolution limitations  @xcite . similarly , while scanning electron microscopy offers a very high spatial resolution , this method has such a small penetration depth that only the surface of a sample can be studied , as shown in the example in figure  [ fig : semstructure ] .    in the field of nanophotonics and metamaterials ,",
    "x - ray techniques have received surprisingly little attention , which is surprising , given that these techniques are ideal to characterize the 3d structure of opaque .",
    "notably , x - rays have excellent penetration depth , the methods are generally non - destructive and readily provide nanometer - scale spatial resolution . here",
    ", we study a si photonic band gap crystal with a 3d diamond - like structure by x - ray holotomography  @xcite .",
    "the crystal has a so - called inverse woodpile structure  @xcite .",
    "similar crystals reveal a strong stabilization of the excited state of embedded semiconductor quantum dots , as demonstrated by ten - fold spontaneous emission inhibition of many emitters simultaneously  @xcite .",
    "the material density distribution of the inverse woodpile crystals is defined by two perpendicular 2d arrays of pores@xcite , as shown in the realized crystal in figure  [ fig : semstructure ]  @xcite . in this report",
    ", the axis are defined such that pores are running the in the @xmath2 and @xmath3-directions .",
    "both 2d arrays have a centred rectangular structure with lattice parameters @xmath4 , that correspond to diamond @xmath5 faces . for cubic diamond - like crystal structures ,",
    "the lattice parameters are hence designed so as to fulfill the condition @xmath6 .",
    "holotomography experiments were performed at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) , beamline id-16ni , in the course of experimental run hc-2520 . in brief , the x - ray beam with @xmath7 kev photon energy is focussed upstream from the sample . by varying sample - to - detector - distance",
    "we modify the diffraction pattern , as we operate in the fresnel regime . to obtain data at all spatial frequencies ,",
    "we collect data at multiple distances . at each distance ,",
    "@xmath8 images were recorded while rotating the sample from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "phase maps are obtained from the intensities at every angle , followed by standard tomographic reconstruction based on the inverse radon transform to obtain the electron density distribution .",
    "birds - eye view of the reconstructed sample volume .",
    "the color scale is the material density @xmath11 interpolated between air and si , the latter set to 255 . ]",
    "the alignment of the pores is a crucial step in the nanofabrication that can only be assessed _ in situ _ by x - ray tomography .",
    "moreover , it is crucial to verify the cylindrical pore geometry , and that pore depth that ultimately limits the crystal size .",
    "figure  [ fig : tomo - volume ] shows the reconstructed volume of one crystal .",
    "a closer inspection  @xcite indeed reveals two sets of pores running in the @xmath2 and the @xmath3-directions , matching the design .",
    "it appears that the angle between the pore arrays systematically deviates by a few degrees from the @xmath12 design .",
    "this means that the crystal structure is not truly cubic but monoclinic .",
    "band structure calculations  @xcite reveal that the 3d photonic band gap remains robust under this effective shear deformation : the photonic band gap becomes hardly narrower , changing from @xmath13 relative bandwidth to more than @xmath14 , which is plenty for strong spontaneous emission control  @xcite .",
    "density profile in the @xmath3-direction through pores in si ( red circles ) .",
    "the black dashed curves is the convolution of a square density function ( blue hatched bars ) and a gaussian resolution function . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : x - cross - section ] shows a cross - section in the @xmath3-direction through three pores in the reconstructed volume . to interpret the density ,",
    "we propose a simple model of a binary normalized density function for silicon ( @xmath15 ) and vacuum ( @xmath16 ) convoluted with a gaussian resolution function .",
    "the adjustable model parameters are the width @xmath17 of a si - wall , the gaussian resolution @xmath18 , the amplitude , and a background .",
    "the data are well modeled with two si - walls with widths @xmath19  nm and @xmath20  nm .",
    "given the @xmath21 nm voxel size and the spatial resolution , this agrees with the design @xmath22  nm , hence we conclude that the structure was faithfully realized .",
    "the resolution widths ( @xmath23  nm and @xmath24  nm ) agree well with the measured x - ray beam size .",
    "modelling of the structure offers a straightforward future path to input tomographic structural data into @xmath25 numerical codes ( fem , fdtd ) to compute nanophotonic properties .",
    "this opens the prospect to do _ model - free _ calculations of metamaterial to predict experiments and device functionality .",
    "we have performed an x - ray holotomography study of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) photonic band gap crystal .",
    "the crystals was made from silicon by cmos - compatible methods .",
    "we manage to obtain the 3d material density throughout the fabricated crystal .",
    "we observe that the structural design is in most aspects well - realized by the fabricated nanostructure .",
    "one exception is a slight shear - distortion of the cubic crystal structure .",
    "we thus conclude that 3d x - ray tomography has great potential to solve many future questions on optical metamaterials for much nanophotonic research and applications , including cavity arrays , physically unclonable functions , and precise localization of light emitters for enhanced efficiency .",
