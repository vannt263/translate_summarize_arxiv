    "the data in the underdoped compounds in their non - superconducting state , on the other hand , show only broad and sometimes step - like features .",
    "increased energy and momentum resolution has made the contrast with the superconducting state , where a sharp peak does emerge , more striking and has led to further doubts about the quasiparticle description of the pseudogap state . as argued elsewhere",
    "@xcite , this contrast between the pseudogap and superconducting lineshapes suggests that the pseudogap region could be dominated by a zero - temperature fractionalized phase .",
    "in addition , recent results in the superconducting state suggest a connection between the weight under the superconducting quasiparticle peak and the condensate density @xcite .",

    "arpes experiments on undoped compounds also show broad spectral features rather than well - defined quasiparticle peaks , which has led us to consider the possibility of a fractionalized antiferromagnet , dubbed @xmath1 .",

    "we briefly discuss the phases shown pictorially in figure [ phases ] . in the @xmath23 range , starting at temperatures much less than the vison gap and lowering the temperature , the bosonic chargons should go from a phase where they are phase incoherent to one where they are condensed .",

    "we expect this spinon theory to work qualitatively at all temperatures well below @xmath47 , where the spinons are strongly paired and the low energy degrees of freedom are fractionalized . in particular , one should note that in the absence of chargon - spinon interactions , the spinons do not notice @xmath3 .",

    "fluctuations around this new minimum are described ( to quadratic order ) by the action : @xmath62 starting in the superconducting phase and increasing the chemical potential toward @xmath63 , the order parameter ( and therefore the condensate density ) vanishes at the transition .",
    "away from half - filling in the presence of long - range coulomb interactions or disorder , we expect the unoccupied sites to form some crystal . even in the case of zero disorder ,",
    "the underlying lattice makes characterization of this phase difficult .",
    "one way to gain intuition for this regime is by reformulating the problem in terms of vortices in the chargon phase @xcite . on physical grounds",
    ", we expect that the strong coupling of the charge degrees of freedom will lead to complicated charge ordered states at zero temperature when the number of bosons is incommensurate with the underlying lattice , and that with increasing doping , the system should eventually pass into a zero - temperature superconducting state .",
    "the location of the transition , @xmath64 , and the nature of the exact ground state for @xmath65 will depend sensitively on the chargon interactions and lattice commensurability effects . lacking a more detailed theory of chargon solidification away from half filling in a fractionalized phase , we will use the xy model defined above to describe the low - energy degrees of freedom at low temperatures in the fractionalized phases .",
    "our main motivation is simplicity : the 2 + 1d xy model contains both a quantum disordered and a superconducting phase of bosons , as the more correct theory of the @xmath66 boson system should .",
    "although this description is obviously inadequate to describe the zero - temperature phases away from half - filling as well as the detailed critical properties of the transition , we note that for a perfectly clean system , the physics at length scales shorter than the mean hole spacing should be those of the half - filled system . at dopings of ,",
    "say , 5 percent , this length is about 5 lattice spacings . in the corresponding energy range",
    ", the 2 + 1 xy model should capture the correct physics .",
    "we note that arpes is an intermediate energy probe , although the energies corresponding to moderate dopings may still be too high . since we are concerned here with general features of spectral function in each phase , we work with this phenomenological landau - ginzburg model , hoping to capture the correct physics",
    ".    therefore , in the charge disordered ( nodal liquid ) phase at temperatures much smaller than the vison gap , we use equation [ softspin ] and find for the chargon correlation function ( setting @xmath67 and ignoring @xmath68 to lowest order ) : @xmath69    we briefly discuss the parameters in the model , @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in the underdoped regime near the critical point , @xmath64 , we expect the chargon gap to be quite small , while at half - filling ( in the parent insulator ) the chargon gap is rather large , the charge gap for these materials being on the order of electron volts .",
    "very little can be said about the velocity @xmath71 without a more detailed microscopic theory .",
    "working in units where is a dimensionless wavenumber , @xmath71 is an energy scale , and we take it to be moderately larger than the spinon kinetic scale , @xmath48 , ( but of the same order ) effectively giving the charge excitations a larger bandwidth than the spinons .    in the ordered phase ( @xmath59 )",
    ", the bosons are superconducting and at @xmath72 the chargon - chargon correlation function has the property : @xmath73 the condensate density .",
    "the quantity @xmath74 is precisely the order parameter of the superconductor . at dopings @xmath75 , as temperature increases within the superfluid phase , we expect phase fluctuations to reduce this quantity , eventually causing it to vanish at @xmath76 . at zero temperature within the superfluid phase , as doping",
    "is decreased it will vanish at @xmath77 . as discussed above , the details of the @xmath72 transition will be governed by the universality class of the true doping - dependent chargon theory .    within the superconducting phase , we may model the bosons with equation [ superconductor ] , which results in the following general form for the chargon spectral function : @xmath78 the fluctuations of the chargon field will be dominated by the detailed interactions between the chargons .",
    "in contrast to the cooper pairs in a standard bcs superconductor , the bosonic chargons should be strongly interacting , given that their uncondensed phase is controlled by mott - insulating physics .",
    "however , we expect that at energies larger than the condensation temperature , @xmath3 , the chargon fluctuations should be the same as in the pseudogap state .",
    "given the spinon and chargon correlation functions , we can compute the electron spectral function , assuming no interactions between chargons and spinons , using the relations in eqns . [",
    "a ] and [ g ] .",

    "this justifies use of the zero - temperature spectral function in our low - energy model .",
    "we therefore compare this @xmath82 with the arpes data in each of the following phases : @xmath1 , nodal liquid ( pseudogap ) , and d - wave superconductor . although equation [ spectral ] is quite simple , it nevertheless is not analytically integrable for arbitrary and @xmath81 . in the following sections , we present the results of numerical integrations of this function and plot the resultant @xmath82 at fixed ( edc ) and at fixed @xmath81 ( mdc ) , along the momentum cuts shown in figure [ cuts ] .",

    "we therefore expect the spectral function at temperatures much lower than the vison gap to be broad , without the delta - function peak at some and @xmath91 which one finds when the underlying phase has electron - like elementary excitations .    for the spinons , we expect that both @xmath49 and @xmath41 are of the order of @xmath92 ; we take @xmath93 . the chargon gap , @xmath70 ,",

    "we have seen above that there will be a sharp ( resolution limited ) peak in the spectral function , with weight equal to the condensate density , located at the spinon gap .",
    "it is only at intermediate energies , ( 1 - 10mev ) , that the detailed physics of the chargons at their charge - ordering critical point becomes important . in the superconductor for @xmath133",
    ", we therefore expect a sharp peak whose weight is given by the condensate density , superimposed on a background which does not change qualitatively as one moves from the superconductor to the pseudogap phase above @xmath3 .",

    "we have shown here that the following aspects of the arpes data in the cuprate materials can be understood by assuming spin - charge separation : 1 ) the d - wave `` pseudogap '' seen above @xmath3 , 2 ) the lack of sharp quasiparticle peaks in the pseudogap phase , 3 ) the emergence of a very sharp quasiparticle peak below @xmath3 , 4 ) the qualitative temperature and doping dependence of the weight under this quasiparticle peak , as well as the existence within the superconducting state of a background similar in shape to the pseudogap spectra , and 5 ) the lack of sharp features in the undoped parent insulators as well as the d - wave character of their `` remnant fermi surface '' .",
    "we emphasize that these results of arpes in the undoped and underdoped compounds are rather hard to account for within a conventional picture of quasiparticles with the quantum numbers of electrons .",
