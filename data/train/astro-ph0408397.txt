    "the analysis of intensity ratios of collisionally excited lines ( cels ) is the standard method for deriving ionic abundances in ionized nebulae .",
    "almost all the available determinations of the gas - phase galactic abundance gradients from regions observations are based on this kind of analysis @xcite .",
    "the use of cels has the disadvantage that their intensity strongly depends on the assumed electron temperature and on the presence of temperature variations or fluctuations over the observed volume of the nebula .",
    "the most dramatic effect of temperature fluctuations is that ionic abundances are underestimated if these fluctuations are present in the objects but not considered in the abundance calculations @xcite .",
    "recombination lines ( rls ) of heavy element ions are very faint and have been difficult to observe in nebular spectra .",
    "fortunately , the availability of high efficiency echelle spectrographs in large aperture telescopes makes feasible the measurement of rls for an increasing number of nebular objects .",
    "several autors have obtained o@xmath0/h@xmath1 and c@xmath0/h@xmath1 from the intensity of and rls for the brightest regions of the galaxy ( peimbert et al .",
    "1993 ; esteban et al .",
    "1998 , 1999a , b , 2004 , hereafter e04 ; tsamis et al . 2003 ; garca - rojas et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter g04 ) ; all of them have found that abundance determinations from rls are systematicaly larger than those obtained using cels , independently of the ion considered .",
    "these differences , as well as other discrepancies in the nebular properties derived , can be consistently accounted for assuming a _ @xmath6 _  ( mean square temperature variation over the observed volume ) in the 0.020.05 range .",
    "@xcite were the first authors who estimated the galactic c and o abundance gradients from rls in regions , but only with three objects and covering a rather small range of galactocetric distances ( from 6.4 to 8.4 kpc , assuming the sun at 8 kpc ) .",
    "this gradient was later revised by @xcite and g04 , these last authors included abundances for an additional region at 7.46 kpc ( ngc 3576 ) . in this letter , we present new values of the c and o gradients obtained from very deep echelle spectra of eight galactic regions located at galactocentric distances ranging from 6.3 to 10.4 kpc ( assuming the sun at 8 kpc ) . some of our sample nebulae were previously observed by our group with other instrumentation  the orion nebula @xcite , m  8 @xcite , and m  17 @xcite , but they have been re - observed for this project .",
    "data of some of the objects included in this paper have been already published : ngc 3576 ( g04 ) and orion nebula ( e04 ) .",
    "the observations were made on 2002 march 11 and 12 and on 2003 march 29 , 30 , and 31 with the ultraviolet visual echelle spectrograph , @xcite , at the very large kueyen telescope in cerro paranal observatory ( chile ) .",
    "we used the standard settings in the two arms of the spectrograph , covering the region from 3100 to 10360   . the instrumental setup and",
    "the technical aspects of the observations were the same in all cases and are described in detail in g04 and e04 .",
    "the results included in this letter correspond to a single slit position in each nebula corresponding to the brightest part of the object .",
    "the atmospheric dispersor corrector was used during the observations in order to avoid the effects of differential atmospheric refraction along the slit .",
    "the total exposure time was very different for each case depending on the surface brightness of the nebulae , ranging from 300 to 600 seconds for the orion nebula and from 2700 to 9612 seconds for s  311 .",
    "in all the cases , the total exposure time was achieved adding three or more individual spectra in each spectral zone .",
    "the slit width was set to 3.0 `` and the slit length was set to 10 '' in the blue arm and to 12 `` in the red arm in the cases of the orion nebula and ngc 3576 and 3.0''@xmath710 \" in both arms for the rest of the objects .",
    "the effective spectral resolution at a given wavelength is @xmath8 .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the iraf echelle reduction package , following the standard procedure .",
    "the standard star eg  274 was observed for flux calibration in the cases of the orion nebula and ngc  3576 ( both observed in 2002 ) .",
    "the rest of the objects were observed in 2003 and flux calibrated with the standard stars : hd  49798 , eg  274 , and cd  @xmath332  9927 .",
    "line intensities were measured as described in g04 and e04 with the splot routine of the iraf package .",
    "table  [ lines ] presents the extinction - corrected intensity of the emission lines relevant to the results concerning this letter , except for orion nebula and ngc 3576 , for which complete line lists and abundance data have been published in e04 and g04 , respectively .",
    "the complete line lists of the rest of the objects will be published elsewhere .",
    "the reddening coefficient , @xmath9 , was determined by fitting iteratively the observed and theoretical balmer decrement following the predictions by @xcite and is included in table  [ abund ] .",
    "we have used the reddening law of @xcite for all the objects listed in table  [ lines ] except in the cases of m8 and m  16 for which we have used the reddening law of @xcite following the prescriptions of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the errors associated with the line intensities have been estimated following g04 .",
    "in table  [ abund ] , we present the adopted electron density , @xmath10 , and temperature , @xmath11 , for each object",
    ". the adopted @xmath10 corresponds to the mean of the values obtained from [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] and [ ] in several of the objects , weighted by their corresponding uncertainties . in the case of",
    "@xmath11 we have adopted two values , one corresponding to the high ionization potential ions , @xmath12 , which is calculated as the weighted mean of the temperature obtained from [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] ( only temperatures from [ ] were available for m  16 and m  20 ) , and other to the low ionization potential ones , @xmath13 , which corresponds to the weighted mean of the values obtained for [ ] and [ ] . in any case ,",
    "intensity ratios of rls are almost independent on @xmath10 and @xmath11 and they are almost unaffected by the values assumed for these parameters .",
    "the temperature and density determinations were carried out with the iraf task temden of the package nebular .",
    "more details on the determination of the physical conditions can be found in g04 and e04 .",
    "the adopted values for @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are included in table  [ abund ] .",
    "we have adopted @xmath12 for the derivation of c@xmath0/h@xmath1 and o@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios and @xmath13 for o@xmath1/h@xmath1 .",
    "we have used the effective recombination coefficients of @xcite for , of @xcite for , and of @xcite for .",
    "the average of the abundances obtained with the effective recombination coefficients of @xcite and @xcite has been used to obtain the o@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio .",
    "we have used the intensity of the brightest line ( 4267  , see figure  [ cii ] ) to derive the c@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio .",
    "other much fainter lines of @xmath14 and @xmath15 transitions of have been observed in all nebulae except ngc 3603 and s311 .",
    "these lines give abundances in complete agreement with those obtained with 4267  .",
    "the only rls of observed in our spectra are those of multiplet 1 .",
    "however , there are several bright sky lines in that spectral region and only 7771.94   can be measured .",
    "unfortunately , a satisfactory deblending of the line from sky lines was not possible in some of the objects due to the radial velocity of the nebulae : orion nebula , m  16 , m  17 , and s  311 .",
    "for these four nebulae as well as for ngc  3603 ( for which lines were not detected ) we have determined the o@xmath1/h@xmath1 ratio from the intensity of [ ] lines using nebular and assuming an appropriate value of @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath6 adopted for each object is also included in table  [ abund ] .",
    "this parameter has been determined from the weighted mean of the different _",
    "_   values obtained from the comparison of ionic abundances obtained from cels and rls of the same ions , the comparison of @xmath11 obtained from cels and from the balmer and paschen discontinuities , as well as a maximum likelihood method applied to the intensity of the brightest lines .",
    "details on the derivation of @xmath6 can be found in g04 and e04 . in the case of the o@xmath0 abundances , the values quoted in table  [ abund ]",
    "are the weighted means of the o@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios obtained from the sum of the intensities of the individual lines of the less case - dependent multiplets observed in each nebula following the prescriptions given in g04 and e04 .",
    "we have used multiplets number 1 , 2 , 10 and the @xmath16 transitions in the cases of orion nebula ( e04 ) and ngc 3576 ( g04 ) , multiplets 1 , 2 , and 10 in the case of m  8 and m  17 , and multiplet 1 in m  16 , m  20 , ngc  3603 , and s  311 .",
    "the lines of multiplet 1 are much brighter than those of the other multiplets and dominate the final mean value , therefore , we have only included the line intensities of multiplet 1 in table  [ lines ] , the rest of the line intensities of m  8 and m  17 will be published elsewhere .",
    "once we have the ionic abundances , we can derive the total abundances of the elements . in the case of o",
    ", we have information of all the relevant ionic species that are expected to be present in the ionized nebulae : o@xmath1 and o@xmath0 . the total o abundance will be simply the sum of the o@xmath1/h@xmath1 and o@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratios .",
    "in the case of c we have only information about the c@xmath0/h@xmath1 ratio . since we do not expect a significant presence of c@xmath17 in the sample ( see garnett et al .",
    "1999 ) , the only important contribution is of c@xmath1 , which does not show emission lines in the spectral range observed . to obtain the final c / h abundance we have used the ionization correction factor ( icf ) for the presence of c@xmath1 derived by @xcite from photoionization models ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "this icf indicates that the c@xmath1/c@xmath0 ratio goes from 0.08@xmath40.04 in the case of ngc  3603 to 2.2@xmath40.8 in the case of m20 , the two nebulae with the extreme values of excitation .",
    "figure  [ grad ] shows the c / h , o / h , and c / o ratios derived for the eight nebulae of the sample .",
    "the galactocentric distances of the objects have been taken from the stellar photometric distances quoted in the survey of galactic star - forming complexes of @xcite and the work on distances to open clusters of @xcite .",
    "the sun is assumed to be at a galactocentric distance of 8 kpc .",
    "simple least - squares linear fits to the data given in figure  [ grad ] give the following gradients :          these gradients and the data used for their derivation correspond to the composition of the ionized gas - phase of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "@xcite estimated that c and o abundances of the orion nebula should be increased about 0.1 dex and 0.08 dex , respectively , to obtain the current gas+dust composition of the local ism .",
    "we do not know if these depletion factors for the orion nebula can be applied to all the sample objects or if they depend on the particular ionization conditions of the nebulae . in any case",
    ", the relatively small dispersion of the c and o abundances for a given distance suggests that the possible differences in the depletion factors should not be large .",
    "therefore , in the absence of further information , we recommend to apply the depletion factors estimated by @xcite to all the objects prior to compare our abundances with the gas - phase ones predicted by chemical evolution models .",
    "the value of the o gradient we derive is shallower than those obtained by @xcite ( @xmath30.080 dex kpc@xmath5 ) and @xcite ( @xmath30.070 dex kpc@xmath5 ) but similar to the value of @xmath30.040 dex kpc@xmath5 obtained by @xcite and that estimated by @xcite ( @xmath30.051 dex kpc@xmath5 ) .",
    "all these determinations of the literature are based on the standard analysis based on the intensity of cels , therefore , their result depend very much on the exact value of the @xmath11 assumed for each object . in our case ,",
    "the o gradient we obtain from cels and assuming @xmath6=0 is found of the form @xmath2log(o / h ) = @xmath30.040@xmath40.006 dex kpc@xmath5 , which is very similar to the gradient we derive from rls .",
    "the ne , ar and and s gradients -which are expected to follow the behavior of o- determined by martn - hernndez , van der hulst , & tielens ( 2003 , and references therein ) from iso data are also consistent with shallower values of the slope .",
    "our c gradient is clearly much steeper than that we obtain for o. its slope is also steeper than the one obtained by @xcite for b stars ( @xmath30.070 dex kpc@xmath5 ) .",
    "the c / o gradient is an important constraint for chemical evolution models and the radial star formation history of the galactic disk because the nucleosynthetic origin of both elements is expected to be quite different .",
    "we find that the c / o ratio increases with metallicity .",
    "our c / o gradient is similar to that obtained by @xcite for two nearby spiral galaxies : m 101 and ngc 2403 ( @xmath30.04 and @xmath30.05 dex kpc@xmath5 , respectively ) , from the analysis of cels in the uv domain and is also similar to that obtained by @xcite for galactic b stars ( @xmath30.050 dex kpc@xmath5 ) .",
    "models of galactic chemical evolution to explain the observed gradients are presented by carigi et al .",
    "c and o are the most important `` biogenic elements '' and their gradients are paramount , in the study of the galactic habitable zone ( e.g. lineweaver , fenner & gibson 2004 and references therein ) as well as to determine the co to h@xmath19 conversion factor ( e.g. strong et al . 2004 and references therein ) .",
