    "since the pioneering paper of unno @xcite in which for the first time a transfer equation was derived for polarized light in the presence of a magnetic field , a number of attempts have been made to obtain a solution for it .",
    "rachkowksy @xcite , after completing the equation by adding anomalous dispersion effects , gave the first analytical solution for the case of milne - eddington atmospheres .",
    "while numerical solutions were more and more successful @xcite analytical trials struggled to overcome the problem of non - commuting absorption matrices .",
    "this problem , already noted in a paper of landi deglinnocenti & landi deglinnocenti @xcite , is pointed out clearly in the work of semel & lpez ariste @xcite ( hereafter referred as paper i ) as the origin of all previous limitations . in this paper ,",
    "deep insights are given on how to benefit from the physical significance of the various terms in the transfer equation to attain an analytical solution as general as possible .",
    "several transformations used here to simplify the rte seem to indicate that the physics of the stokes parameters is best described in geometrical terms . indeed , we shall show in this paper that the poincar ( plus dilatations ) group is at the origin of these geometrical aspects , and we shall use its algebraic properties to solve the problem even for non  commuting absorption matrices and give a general solution for this equation of transfer .",
    "the fundamental problem addressed in the present paper is the existence of an analytical solution to the rte . at present ,",
    "analytical solutions exist for only very limited cases and the known formal solutions @xcite do not offer , in the general case , any advantage from the computational point of view .",
    "apart from the interest of a computable analytical solution by itself , it would be of greater importance for testing numerical codes which nowadays are considered acceptable only by observing their _ convergence _ upon increasing number of layers .",
    "this is not a very satisfactory situation .",
    "we think that the solution presented in this paper is the first step towards a general solution suitable for testing computations .",
    "why an analytical solution could not be found so far is our first question .",
    "it is our belief that group theory is the key to the solution and that explains why it had not been reached up to now ( this could already be understood from the conclusions in paper i which stressed the importance of the non - commutativity of matrices in this problem , but it is still clearer here ) .",
    "group theory is not common in astronomical literature .",
    "however the rte of polarized light has become a more and more important problem in astrophysics , related , for instance , to the measurement of magnetic fields via the zeeman or hanle effects .",
    "hence group theory should be accessible to the concerned astrophysical community , and with its help we can give a method to find the solution , and explicitly give the full expression of the analytical solution for the most general case .",
    "any other particular or general solution will benefit from the use of advanced linear algebra , and so avoid wasted effort .",
    "last but not least , it may deepen our understanding of stokes polarimetry .",
    "we begin our research by disclosing the mathematical nature of the stokes vector , starting with its physical definition and extending to the appropriate mathematics to treat our problem .",
    "extensive literature has already been devoted to the existing relations between polarization and the lorentz group , mainly from the optical point of view ( see for instance cloude 1986 ; givens & kostinski 1993 ; sridhar & simon 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "usually these works take off from the jones formalism for polarized light @xcite and develop these relations . here a similar path is followed to show that the stokes vector is a 4vector in a minkowski - like space .",
    "the demonstration is based on the comparison between the usual definition for the stokes parameters ( see for example shurcliff , 1962 , or jefferies , lites & skumanich , 1989 ) and the well  known relations between the definition of a spinor and its different representations ( see for instance landau & lifshitz , 1971 ) . in the same line of thought , we will propose in section 3 that the rte is just a representation of an infinitesimal poincar ( plus dilatations ) transformation in the minkowski - like space where the 4vectors are best described .",
    "this new interpretation of the equation of transfer suggests that any solution to this equation must be a finite poincar transformation .",
    "we calculate it in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "we note that nothing differentiates the transfer equation as written elsewhere in the literature from a poincar transformation , although at present a demonstration is not available , apart from this similarity .",
    "we anticipate that a finite poincar transformation may be a solution for the rte .    the concepts of 4vector",
    ", minkowsky space or lorentz and poincar transformations must be understood throughout this paper in their purest mathematical sense , beyond their historical meaning .",
    "these concepts originated in the framework of the special theory of relativity , however mathematics did abstraction of these tools and incorporated them into more general frames of geometry and group theory .",
    "therefore we define 4vectors as sets of 4 numbers characterized by their minkowsky norm and described in a hyperbolic 4dimensional space called the minkowsky space , which , in this paper , we will refer to as the _ minkowsky  like space _ , in order to stress the difference with the usual minkowsky space used in relativity .",
    "lorentz and poincar transformations describe movements in this space : generalized translations and rotations . in the relativistic formalism",
    "these movements are interpreted as a change of reference system . in this paper",
    "they are not given that meaning , but are seen as changes in the polarization state .",
    "the manipulation of these concepts is identical here and in the relativistic formalism , if one takes care in substituting the four stokes parameters for space and time , and for the speed its analogues as shown in section 3 .",
    "the 4 stokes parameters are usually represented by @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for the total intensity of light , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the linear polarized light in two axes rotated by @xmath4 one from the other , and @xmath5 for the circularly polarized light .",
    "these four quantities are not completely free but must satisfy an energy condition : there can not be more polarized light than total light .",
    "this condition suggests an interpretation of the stokes parameters as a 4vector in a minkowski - like space .",
    "the norm of a vector in such a space is defined as @xmath6 hence the above condition is naturally satisfied by vectors with a positive norm , in parallelism to _ time - like _ vectors in special relativity . continuing this parallelism ,",
    "light - cone _ can be defined as the surface which obeys the condition @xmath7 that is @xmath8 in our context , this surface contains all the different possibilities for fully polarized light .",
    "the stokes vector must be inside or , in the limit , on this _ light - cone _ ( see fig .",
    "[ cono ] ) to obey condition ( [ norm ] ) .",
    "an exception to this parallelism with special relativity : the _ backward light cone _ does not have an equivalent with the stokes vectors .    to consolidate and extend this interpretation of the stokes parameters we begin with the definition of the stokes parameters in terms of the electric field .",
    "a transversal monochromatic light wave is completely described by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the components of the electrical field in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of light , @xmath11 .",
    "following definitions in landau & lifshitz @xcite , these two components can be arranged in a 2dimensional vector . since it transforms linearly under the proper lorentz group ( ibid . )",
    "this vector can be called a _",
    "spinor of rank one_. as an illustration of this kind of transformation , we profit from the fact that any element of this group in its 2dimensional representation can be written as a linear combination of the pauli matrices ( plus the @xmath12 identity matrix ) : @xmath13 and transform the electric field vector by these matrices : @xmath14 the result is always a new 2-dimensional electric field vector which describes a different state of polarization .",
    "a spinor of rank two can be easily constructed by multiplying conveniently two spinors of rank one . for our particular spinor",
    "we obtain @xmath15 where the @xmath16 symbol stands for complex conjugated .",
    "this 2nd rank spinor is to be compared with the _ coherency matrix _",
    "( see born & wolf 1980 ) .",
    "in fact the last is defined for any given light beam , and a mean over frequencies or time is necessary in the above expression of @xmath17 to fulfill the definition . the average of @xmath18 is a linear combination of matrices of the form referred . since spinors of rank two form a linear vector space ,",
    "any linear combination of spinors will be a spinor as well .",
    "hence the coherency matrix , defined usually as @xmath19 is still a spinor of rank two .",
    "since a spinor built in this way has 4 independent components ( the four entries of the matrix ) , there must exist a relation between it and a 4-vector , which also has 4 independent components .",
    "technically speaking , both must be different _ realizations of the same irreducible representation of the lorentz group _",
    "( landau & lifshitz 1971 , page 55 ) .",
    "the components @xmath20 of this 4vector are indeed related to the components of @xmath21 as @xmath22 these components are identical to the definition of the stokes parameters as given by jefferies _",
    "@xcite , or born & wolf @xcite for instance .",
    "the conclusion is evident : the resulting 4vector , derived from the coherency matrix , a spinor of rank 2 , is the stokes vector .",
    "this formalism can be given in an alternative way : an usual basis for spinors is the set of pauli matrices plus the @xmath12 identity matrix .",
    "the coherency matrix expressed in this basis has for coefficients the stokes parameters @xmath23 using this relation we can write in a more compact form relations ( [ ij ] ) as : @xmath24,\\ ] ] where the vector @xmath25 has four components , the @xmath12 identity matrix and the 3 pauli matrices , and _",
    "tr _ denotes the trace operation on matrices .",
    "these relations stress further the interpretation of the stokes parameters as a 4vector in a minkowski - like space .",
    "we stress that when talking about a minkowski_like _ space we mean that the coordinates in our 4dimensional space are no longer space and time , but the stokes parameters , contrary to the usual minkowski space used in relativistic formalism . on the other hand the underlying",
    "_ hyperbolic _ geometry is exactly the same in both cases , mathematically speaking they are the same space .",
    "all the usual properties of the stokes parameters are recovered in this space .",
    "for instance the sum of two 4vectors is a new 4vector , a well - known property of the stokes parameters .",
    "contrary to the usual minkowsky space , the absence of the _ backward light cone _ implies not only that negative intensities are meaningless , but also that the negative of a stokes vector does not exist .",
    "hence subtraction of stokes vectors is naturally forbidden in this space .",
    "since the stokes vector is a 4vector in a minkowski - like space , one may wonder what would be the meaning of a lorentz transformation over the stokes parameters .",
    "homogeneous lorentz transformations form a 6parameter lie group : 6 generators suffice to describe all possible infinitesimal transformations .",
    "these generators are ( see for example greiner 1990 , or any textbook in special relativity or group theory ) as the metric for the minkowski space ] :    * the three @xmath26 matrices for 3-dimensional spatial rotations @xmath27 @xmath28 * the three @xmath26 matrices for hyperbolic rotations ( or lorentz boosts in relativistic terms ) @xmath29 @xmath30    an infinitesimal lorentz transformation over the stokes 4vector @xmath31 can be expressed as a sum of generators multiplied by their respective infinitesimal parameters : @xmath32 for convenience , we can re - write all these parameters(@xmath33 ) in terms of a common parameter @xmath34 , expressed in differential form ( we are dealing with an infinitesimal transformation ) @xmath35 and the infinitesimal transformation reads now : @xmath36 given the infinitesimal character of the transformation , expressed explicitly by putting the common parameter @xmath37 , it easily leads to a differential equation for @xmath31 in the variable @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a @xmath26 matrix given by @xmath41 @xmath42 matrix @xmath40 looks like the well - known absorption matrix @xcite . at this point",
    "the possibility that the rte could be written as an infinitesimal transformation involving the lorentz group seems to be at hand .",
    "but @xmath40 still differs from the general form of the absorption matrix .",
    "in particular the inclusion of a diagonal term is necessary if we want to take into account the scalar absorption represented by @xmath43 in the usual matrix . to include it",
    "we just add to the usual 6 generators of the lorentz group the one for the dilatation transformation .",
    "while dealing with the homogeneous group , we can represent the generator of dilatations by the @xmath26 identity matrix .",
    "we will repeat all the previous steps calling the new parameter for this transformation @xmath43 : @xmath44 to finally obtain : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 @xmath48 matrix can now be compared to the so - called absorption matrix which appears in rte @xcite .",
    "coefficient @xmath43 gives the scalar absorption , independent of polarization .",
    "this absorption has its equivalent in a contraction ( that is a negative dilatation ) of the stokes 4vector .",
    "the 3vector @xmath49 is responsible for the creation and absorption of polarization , which is understood here to be a hyperbolic rotation ( or lorentz boost ) of the stokes 4-vector .",
    "finally the 3vector @xmath50 gives the so - called faraday rotation in zeeman effect and , as its name seems to indicate , it rotates the stokes 4vector inside the 3-dimensional space of polarized states ( also called _ poincar sphere _ ) .",
    "note that from the previous paragraph it can not be stated that any infinitesimal lorentz ( plus dilatations ) transformation is a transfer equation .",
    "we state that the absorption matrix as it is usually written elsewhere in the literature , can not be differentiated from an infinitesimal lorentz transformation ( indeed we have decomposed the absorption matrix in the rte in terms of the infinitesimal generators of the lorentz transformations ) .",
    "in fact , it is well known that the actual absorption matrix for zeeman effect must still obey some further constraints . in this sense a general lorentz ( plus dilatations )",
    "transformation is too general : absorption matrices standing for a real physical process would constitute only a subset of all possible lorentz ( plus dilatations ) transformations . while it is evident that a further study of this relation is necessary , in this paper we will only make use of the _ mathematical advantage _ and postpone the rest for a forthcoming paper .",
    "( [ etr ] ) is not yet the complete transfer equation .",
    "an inhomogeneous term , the emission vector , is still needed . for this purpose",
    "there are appropriate movements in the minkowski space : the homogeneous lorentz group can be extended to the inhomogeneous poincar group .",
    "this 10-parameter lie group shares 6 infinitesimal generators with the lorentz group and adds 4 more generators ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) to take into account translations along i , q , u and v ( what in relativistic formalism would be translations in time and space ) .",
    "these generators operate on a generic stokes vector as follows : @xmath53    after including dilatations , the infinitesimal inhomogeneous transformation is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the emission vector . some algebraic manipulations equivalent to those used for",
    "the homogeneous group will lead to the complete radiative transfer equation .",
    "it is interesting to note the fact that these generators allow one to write an inhomogeneous term ( the source function ) in a pseudo - homogeneous way : @xmath56 a useful representation to understand this apparent paradox is the one using differential operators .",
    "let us call @xmath57 , @xmath58 and so on , and write @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "it is evident that with such an operator , relations ( [ lasp ] ) hold .",
    "all the other generators can be rewritten in this representation .",
    "for instance , the dilatation generator can be written @xmath61 and the generator of rotations in the plane @xmath62 , for instance , is @xmath63 the interested reader will find good discussions on the representations of the poincar group and the dilatation transformation in greiner ( 1990 ) , gourdin ( 1982 ) or jones ( 1996 ) for example .",
    "in view of the results obtained in the last section , the solution to the rte appears to be quite straightforwardly a finite poincar ( plus dilatations ) transformation .",
    "the important fact now is that we already know how to write such a finite transformation : if we denote the 11 generators by @xmath64 , a finite element of this group can always be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the parameters of the transformation for each movement , the equivalent of angles for usual rotations . the next problem is how to calculate those finite parameters @xmath67 from their infinitesimal counterparts ( @xmath68 and so on ) .",
    "unfortunately this is not an easy task .",
    "the problem resides in the non  commutativity of the generators .",
    "the next paragraph proposes a solution to this problem , but first we consider it useful to clarify why other approaches will not work .",
    "magnus @xcite ( a brief introduction to this paper can be found in the appendix of the paper by semel & lpez ariste , 1999 ) has already written a finite transformation in terms of such a unique exponential . a quick inspection of the expression given there illustrates why we consider that this calculation is not an easy task .",
    "nevertheless some simple cases can be proposed in which the relation between the @xmath69 and the respective infinitesimal parameters is plain .",
    "for instance in the case of 3dimensional rotations it is always possible to transform ( by means of the euler angles ) our initial reference system into another one for which the rotation axis is parallel to one of the new reference axes . in the case of a fixed axis",
    ", just one generator suffices to describe the movement .",
    "if we call this generator @xmath70 , and the infinitesimal parameter @xmath71 , the finite transformation results in @xmath72 apparently , our problem is solved if we deal with a unique generator per exponential .",
    "hence , we can propose for instance a solution in the form of a product of several exponentials , one for each generator : @xmath73 now the derivative of each exponential in the product can be easily calculated in a very compact form , and so the product of all of them , and consequently the new finite parameters @xmath74 ( as in the above example ) .",
    "but a new question arises : which order should be chosen for the exponentials ?",
    "again due to the non - commutativity of the infinitesimal generators , different orders produce different results , @xmath75 and in general no particular order will be the solution .",
    "an answer to this kind of problem has been given by wei & norman @xcite .",
    "in what follows , we sketch the solution there proposed and apply it to our particular problem .",
    "we start with the homogeneous equation ( just the lorentz group plus dilatations ) and in the next section we will incorporate the inhomogeneous part and handle the full poincar group .",
    "the ordering problem can be recast as follows : we may say that by introducing an order in the exponentials we introduce an error . in spite of this error ,",
    "let us choose a particular order for the exponentials and then substitute the @xmath74 ( which could be calculated straightforwardly as the integrals over the path of the corresponding infinitesimal parameters ) for some unspecified scalar functions @xmath76 : @xmath77 the new functions @xmath76 have to , in a certain sense , take into account the effect of the @xmath74 and correct the error introduced by the chosen order .",
    "existence for those @xmath78 functions can only be ensured after introducing the proposed solution into the rte .",
    "the following consistency equation for the @xmath78 s is obtained as a necessary condition for eq.([si ] ) to be a solution : @xmath79 \\tens{t}_i\\left [ \\prod^{1}_{j = i-1 } \\exp ( -g_j \\tens{t}_j ) \\right ] , \\label{wn}\\ ] ] where the dot denotes derivative over the integration variable @xmath80 .",
    "this equation was the aim of this section so far .",
    "a less heuristic but more direct way of introducing it is to look for a solution of the form ( [ si ] ) and introduce it into the transfer equation .",
    "it is straightforward to fall upon eq.([wn ] ) as the condition for ( [ si ] ) to be a solution .    in what follows in this and the next sections we shall solve eq.([wn ] ) for the @xmath78 s .",
    "the details being quite technical , the reader may wish to skip this and go directly to eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) .",
    "( [ wn ] ) is quite an involved equation .",
    "it requires calculation of a non negligible number of expressions of the form @xmath81 this is to be done by means of the baker - hausdorff formula , which states that @xmath82+\\frac{1}{2!}[x,[x , y]]+ \\frac{1}{3!}[x,[x,[x , y]]]+\\ldots\\ ] ]    in the form they have been written in the last section , the generators of the lorentz group obey the following lie algebra : @xmath83 & = & - \\varepsilon _ { ijk } \\tens{s}_k   \\\\ \\left [ \\tens{s}_i , \\tens{s } _ j \\right ] & = & \\varepsilon _ { ijk } \\tens{s}_k \\\\ \\left[\\tens{s}_i,\\tens{k}_j\\right]&= & \\varepsilon _ { ijk } \\tens{k}_k \\\\ \\left[\\tens{s}_i,\\bbbone \\right]&=&0",
    "\\\\ \\left[\\tens{k}_i,\\bbbone \\right]&=&0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which does not facilitate calculations at all .",

    "the initial algebra of 6 generators has been decomposed into two sub - algebras of 3 generators each , with the particularity that each generator of one sub - algebra commutes with every generator of the other one .",
    "the dilatations generator , which must be added to them , commutes with every other generator ( remember that , while constrained to the homogeneous group , the dilatation generator can be represented by the identity matrix ) and therefore there is no ordering problem associated with it .",

    "if we write the transfer equation as @xmath128 then , @xmath87 , an element of the poincar group plus dilatations , can be decomposed into @xmath129 where @xmath90 is the usual absorption matrix , an element of the homogeneous group , and @xmath130 , which stands for the set of four translations introduced in section 3 , is an element of both the radical and the inhomogeneous part of the equation . in the last section we dealt with the homogeneous equation and found a solution for the evolution operator @xmath131 by using the lorentz group plus dilatations .",
    "now , it is easy to demonstrate that if we are able to solve the equation @xmath132 a solution for the complete transfer equation can be written in the form @xmath133 in fact , this result is exactly equivalent to the formal solution given by landi deglinnocenti & landi deglinnocenti(1985 ) . to prove it",
    ", we note that @xmath134 will give , by properties of the evolution operator , a new @xmath135 .",
    "the effect of @xmath130 is however independent of the actual value of @xmath135 , we will always obtain that @xmath136 where the @xmath137 s are the infinitesimal parameters of the translation transformation : the emission vector in our particular case .",
    "the previous equation results therefore in @xmath138 which can be integrated at once : @xmath139 combining it with the homogeneous solution , we obtain the final complete solution : @xmath140 and benefiting from the well known properties of the evolution operator , we can transform this expression into the formal solution given in the above referred paper : @xmath141    hence , once the evolution operator is solved as shown in the previous section we can use this expression to obtain the complete solution . instead of doing that , we shall proceed with the techniques provided by the group theory and obtain a completely equivalent but independent expression for @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath130 belongs to the radical which , by definition , is an ideal of the poincar group , so that in fact the term @xmath143 is just a linear combination of the infinitesimal generators of @xmath125 : @xmath144 obtaining the coefficients @xmath145 ( with @xmath146 ) is quite long , the detailed calculation is to be found in the appendix .",
    "this calculation constitutes by itself a demonstration of the first statement of this paragraph for our particular case , a long one , but which does not require further knowledge in group theory .",
    "the next step is to solve the equation @xmath147 this is in fact a very easy equation , as every @xmath148 commutes with each other . the solution can be given at once as @xmath149 @xmath150 calculation of the exponentials is straightforward : the @xmath148 are the infinitesimal generators of translations in the four axes @xmath151 , hence by exponentiation we recuperate the finite transformation : @xmath152    the last step is to put together the homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions by using expression ( [ sol ] ) .",

    "as discussed in the previous section , it is even too general .",
    "this solution is also independent of any model atmosphere .",
    "this is necessary to ensure its generality , but presents the problem of the integrability : have the integrals for the @xmath78 s and the inhomogeneous vector @xmath154 an analytical expression for all and every interesting case ?",
    "the most likely answer is no .",
    "but whatever the answer , physical intuition indicates that there must always exist at least a numerical solution to them .",
    "however further work must be developed on the subject .",
    "it is also important to note that we are proposing not just an expression as solution of the rte , but a method : particular cases may ask for different orderings of the generators or even a different decomposition of the product of exponentials .",
    "we have seen that we can in any case give a solution in the form of seven exponentials , but , for instance , when solving constant matrix atmospheres it may be more interesting to consider only the product of 3 exponentials , one with the @xmath155 generators a second one for the @xmath109 s , and a last for the dilatations , or even a sole one , in which case the solution for the evolution operator can be written at once : @xmath156 in accordance with magnus solution ( magnus , 1954 ) or with the scalar  like exponential solution ( semel & lpez ariste , 1999 ) . for any number of exponentials , the method will work , the sole problem being to solve the subsequent scalar linear equations and integrals . in all the cases , a _ compact and finite _ expression for the solution is obtained and the problem is reduced to the ability to integrate scalar expressions .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a new formalism to handle stokes parameters and radiative transfer equations for polarized light . in this formalism , the stokes parameters appear as a 4vector in a minkowski ",
    "like 4dimensional space , and its evolution in time looks mathematically as typical rotations , contractions and translations in this space .",
    "these movements are completely described by the transformations of the group of poincar plus dilatations , a @xmath157 dimension group , well - known from other areas of physics and mathematics .",
    "the rte is shown to be an infinitesimal transformation of this group .",
    "we therefore propose that a solution to the rte can be given in the form of a finite transformation of the poincar plus dilatations group .",
    "obtaining of this solution from the variables present in the transfer equation raises some technical difficulties which have been overcome by the use of the wei - norman method @xcite .",
    "the final obstacle is reduced to a scalar riccati equation .",
    "the riccati equation is a well studied first order differential equation , characterized by its quadratic term .",
    "this non - linearity can at worst prevent an explicit solution , and usually make it difficult to calculate . in any case",
    "the problem of giving a solution for the rte will have been reduced from solving a 4dimensional vector equation to solving a scalar riccati one .",
    "whenever this riccati equation can be integrated , a complete solution is obtained for the rte .    until now only numerical integration methods",

    "al , 1998 or lpez ariste & semel , 1999 ) were capable of integrating non - constant @xmath90 matrices .",
    "the only way to test the validity of the solution and the convergence rates was to compare them with previous methods , known to converge asymptotically .",
    "the solution presented in this paper may allow a comparison with an analytically exact solution .",
    "we anticipate that new numerical methods will be developed taking advantage of the analytical solution ; perhaps faster and more precise than previous ones .    in order to obtain this solution we made use of a mathematical frame , group theory ,",
    "rarely seen in the astrophysical literature .",
    "the advantages gained in the integration of the polarized rte warranted the efforts .",
    "we anticipate that new results in the study of polarized light transfer in astrophysical problems will be achieved by the use of this and related techniques .",
    "as explained in section [ homo ] , we need to calculate , in order to obtain the final solution , a term of the form @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the evolution operator , solution of the homogeneous equation , i.e. , @xmath160 and where @xmath130 is the inhomogeneous part of the transfer equation which can be written as @xmath161 where the @xmath137 are the components of the emission vector . in a further effort to simplify the calculations , instead of this linear combination",
