    "at 760 kpc ( @xcite ) the andromeda galaxy ( ) is the nearest spiral galaxy to our own .",
    "the x - ray emission of m31 is dominated by point sources , either x - ray binaries or supernova remnants with luminosities @xmath0 erg @xmath1 .",
    "x - ray binaries ( xb ) are close binary star systems in which one star is normal and the other is a neutron star or black hole .",
    "they are classified by the mass of the normal star high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) are generally powered by wind accretion while low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) are powered by roche lobe overflow via disc accretion .",
    "hmxb occur in regions of recent star formation ( @xmath2 yr ) while lmxb have longer evolutionary time scales and are associated with older stellar populations .",
    "there is little star formation in m31 and the core is dominated by old stars .",
    "three _ xmm - newton _ observations have been made of the core of m31 , as part of a survey of the whole galaxy .",
    "only one x - ray source has in the core been identified with a snr ( @xcite ) ; hence the majority of x - ray sources will be xb .",
    "these observations yield information on xb with luminosities @xmath3 a few 10@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ) .",
    "x - ray binaries exhibit several types of variability on short time - scales ( i.e. milliseconds to hours ) , e.g. x - ray bursts , x - ray flares or dips as reviewed below .",
    "hence a survey of the x - ray sources in m31 has been undertaken , in search of such variability in the combined lightcurves of the epic mos and pn detectors on board @xmath6 .",
    "early results are presented in this work .",
    "variability of x - ray sources over 6 month time - scales is discussed by @xcite who also discovered a short period supersoft transient .",
    "hard x - ray flares have been observed in only three lmxb in our galaxy , and ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "scox-1 and scox-2 are classified as z - sources , characterised by luminosities of @xmath7 erg s@xmath5 , a low inclination angle and strongly correlated temporal and spectral variability ; and exhibit active states when flaring occurs and quiescent states , known as the flaring branch and normal branch respectively .",
    "exhibits flaring and non - flaring states and a high luminosity , but it also exhibits periodic intensity dips due its high inclination angle and so is classified as a dipper .",
    "flaring involves an increase in the intensity and hardness over a period of a few hundred to a few thousand seconds before returning to the original spectral hardness and intensity .",
    "it seems likely that such flaring behaviour is characteristic of a z - source .",
    "@xcite classified six galactic lmxb as z - sources , characterised by high luminosity , low inclination angle and a 6 hz quasi - periodic oscillation on the normal branch .",
    "however , not all z - sources flare on the flaring branch ; z - sources may be classified as like ( which flare ) and like ( which do not ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "to date is the only known extra - galactic z - source ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray bursts are caused by thermonuclear burning of accreted material on the neutron star surface ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity rapidly reaches the eddington limit then decays exponentially ; typical bursts have rise times of a few seconds and decay over tens or hundreds of seconds ; however , bursts have been observed with durations of several hours ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the frequency of bursts is inversely proportional to the non - burst luminosity of the lmxb ; x - ray bursting halts if the luminosity of the lmxb is normally greater than half the eddington luminosity .",
    "no x - ray bursts have been detected outside our galaxy prior to these observations .",
    "accretion onto the neutron star in lmxb occurs via an accretion disc ; the stream of matter flowing from the normal star collides with the outer edge of the accretion disc , causing a bulge to be created ( @xcite ) . in systems with a high inclination angle",
    ", the x - ray source may be periodically obscured by material in the bulge , causing photo - electric absorption , preferentially removing photons at lower energies ( e.g. @xcite ) ; this is dipping .",
    "no dips have been previously detected in lmxb outside our galaxy .",

    "the observations lasted 38 ks , 13 ks and 56 ks respectively .",
    "lightcurves for the 2000 , december observation were extracted for all three epic instruments from each of the 35 brightest point sources in a broad energy band ( 0.310 kev ) and narrower bands to highlight dips ( 0.32.5 kev ) , bursts ( 2.510 kev ) and flares ( 4 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the extraction regions were circular with a 20  radius ; the equivalent background lightcurves were extracted for each source from nearby regions of the same size but free of point sources .",
    "the lightcurves from mos1 , mos2 and the pn were combined for each source , and variability was sought with 100s , 200s and 400s time bins by fitting a constant intensity to the lightcurves .",
    "four point sources exhibited striking variability , and lightcurves from the other two observations were obtained for them .",
    "they will be discussed in turn .",
    "none of these sources are associated with the globular clusters identified in m31 by @xcite .",
    "the point source ( hereafter known as s1 ) is the brightest source in the field of view .",
    "possible hard flaring is exhibited in the first and second observations , and striking variability in all energy bands is exhibited in the third observation , which resembles the flaring branch movement of galactic z - sources ( @xcite ) . with 500 s time binning , the probability that the 2.510 kev variability during the flaring in observation 1 is significant is @xmath399.5% .",

    "[ rbarnard - c1_s2d ] .",
    "the dipping is detected as a decrease in the low energy band intensity with a lesser variation in the high energy band , resulting in an increase in hardness ; during dipping , the ratio of intensities of the 2.510 kev band to the 0.32.5 kev band doubles .",
    "there is no evidence of periodicity in this observation , indicating that the orbital period is longer than the duration of this short observation .",
    "the dipping is detected at a probability of @xmath399.5% as simple variability in the 0.32.5 kev lightcurve ; however , the structure in the lightcurve increases the significance .",

    "@xcite show that this object is a bright supersoft source , having a spectrum which well is represented by a 60 ev blackbody .",
    "these systems consist of a white dwarf suffering thermal time - scale mass transfer from its binary companion , steadily burning the accreted gas ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most such sss have been found in the magellanic clouds and m31 because the galactic population is so highly absorbed by the galactic disk .",
    "rather little is known about their short - term variability , although a number are known to be transient with turn - on times of a few days ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the luminosity variation of such sources can be much more extreme than the intensity variation due to the large fraction of the flux lost to absorption .",
    "( s4 ) 0.32.5 kev lightcurve from the 2000 , june observation exhibits several intensity dips while the high energy band remains unchanged , indicating photo - electric absorption ( fig .  [ rbarnard - c1_s4l ] ) .",
