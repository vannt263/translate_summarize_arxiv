    "topological excitation is defined as a nontrivial texture or singularity that is stable under an arbitrary continuous transformation in @xmath13 .",

    "for example , in the case of scalar becs or superfluid helium 4 , the symmetry group @xmath14 reduces to @xmath15 , and the order parameter manifold is @xmath16 . because @xmath17 , vortices created in these systems are characterized by integers , where @xmath18 shows the relation of _ isomorphism _ , and @xmath19 is an additive group of integers which implies that two vortices with winding number @xmath20 can continuously coalesce into a vortex with winding number @xmath21",

    "examples of singular topological excitations include a domain wall , a vortex , and a monopole , while those of nonsingular ones include a sine - gordon kink , a two - dimensional skyrmion , and a three - dimensional skyrmion .",
    "this classification is valid only when there is no other topological excitation with different dimensions of homotopy . in the case of @xmath26 , however , when a vortex ( @xmath27 ) and a monopole ( @xmath28 ) coexist , @xmath29 is not always applicable for labeling the monopole .",
    "such a situation may occur in kibble - zurek phenomena @xcite .",
    "when we rapidly cool the system from a disordered to an ordered phase , topological excitations emerge spontaneously , because order parameters far away from each other are causally disconnected and can grow independently . hence , it is possible for vortices , monopoles , and skyrmions to arise simultaneously and coexist . in such a case , topological excitations can influence each other and the very concept of the topological charge needs to be carefully reexamined . in this paper",

    "<S> topological excitations are usually classified by the @xmath0th homotopy group @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , for topological excitations that coexist with vortices , there are case in which an element of @xmath1 can not properly describe the charge of a topological excitation due to the influence of the vortices . </S>",
    "<S> this is because an element of @xmath1 corresponding to the charge of a topological excitation may change when the topological excitation circumnavigates a vortex . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is referred to as the action of @xmath2 on @xmath1 . in this paper , we show that topological excitations coexisting with vortices are classified by the abe homotopy group @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0th abe homotopy group @xmath3 is defined as a semi - direct product of @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in this framework , </S>",
    "<S> the action of @xmath2 on @xmath1 is understood as originating from noncommutativity between @xmath2 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a physical charge of a topological excitation can be described in terms of the conjugacy class of the abe homotopy group . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the abe homotopy group naturally describes vortex - pair creation and annihilation processes , which also influence topological excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the influence of vortices on topological excitations for the case in which the order parameter manifold is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an @xmath0-dimensional sphere and @xmath6 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the influence of vortices on a topological excitation exists only if @xmath0 is even and @xmath6 includes a nontrivial element of @xmath8 . </S>"
