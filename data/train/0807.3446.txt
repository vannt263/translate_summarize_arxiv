    "events containing a high @xmath6 isolated electron or muon and associated with missing transverse momentum have been observed at hera @xcite .",
    "an excess of hera  i data events ( 19942000 , mostly in @xmath7 collisions ) compared to the sm prediction at large hadronic transverse momentum @xmath8 was reported by the h1 collaboration @xcite .",
    "r0.5        the main sm contribution is the production of real @xmath0 bosons via photoproduction with subsequent leptonic decay @xmath9(@xmath10)@xmath11 , where the hadronic system @xmath11 is typically of low @xmath6 .",
    "the event selection employed by the h1 @xcite analysis may be summarised as follows : the identified lepton should have high transverse momentum @xmath12  10  gev , be observed in the central region of the detector and be isolated with respect to jets and other tracks in the event .",
    "the event should also contain a large transverse momentum imbalance , @xmath13  12  gev .",
    "further cuts are then applied , which are designed to reduce sm background , whilst preserving a high level of signal purity .",
    "the analysis has recently been performed on the electron and muon channels using the complete hera i+ii data sets , which corresponds to 478  pb@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "the observed data excess in the hera  i @xmath7 data thus remains at the 3.0@xmath16 level for the complete h1 @xmath7 dataset .",

    "overall there is good agreement with the sm expectation .",
