    "is covered in chapter  [ ch : producao ] , where we point out that a fourth type of cp violation exists , has not been measured , and , before it is measured , it must be taken into account as a source of systematic uncertainty in the extraction of the ckm phase @xmath2 from @xmath3 decays , due to @xmath4 mixing .",

    "this is used to stress that cp violation lies not in the charged @xmath5 interactions , nor in the yukawa couplings ; but rather on the `` clash '' between the two .",
    "we stress that there are only two large phases in the ckm matrix  @xmath6 and @xmath2 ( @xmath7 _ by definition _ )  and that the interactions of the usual quarks with @xmath8 require only two further phases , regardless of the model in question  this is later used in section  [ sec : simplified_q / p ] in order to parametrize a class of new physics models with non - unitary ckm matrix and new phases in @xmath9 mixing .",
    "we point out that the `` unitarity triangle '' provides a comparison between information involving mixing and information obtained exclusively from decay , but we stress that this is only one of many tests on the ckm matrix . on the contrary ,",

    "chapter  [ ch : b_decays ] contains a description of some important @xmath11 decays .    throughout , the emphasis is not on the detailed numerical analysis of the latest experimental announcements ( although some such information is included ) but , rather , on generic lessons and strategies that may be learned from some classes of methods used in interpreting @xmath0 decays .",
    "finally , the usual warnings : given its size , only a few topics could be included in this text and their choice was mostly driven by personal taste ; also , only those references used in preparing the lectures have been mentioned .",
    "a more complete list can be found , for example , in the following books @xcite and reviews @xcite .",
    "these lectures concern the behavior of elementary particles and interactions under the following discrete symmetries : c  charge which transforms a particle into its antiparticle ; p  parity which reverses the spatial axis ; and t  time - reversal which inverts the time axis . as far as we know ,",
    "all interactions except the weak interaction are invariant under these transformations .",
    "the fact that c and p are violated was included in 1958 into the v - a form of the weak lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the interest in cp violation grew out of a 1964 experiment by christenson , cronin , fitch , and turlay @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind this experiment is quite simple : if you find that a given particle can decay into two cp eigenstates which have opposite cp eigenvalues , you will have established the existence of cp violation .",
    "there are two neutral kaon states which are eigenvectors of the strong lagrangian : @xmath12 , made out of @xmath13 quarks , and @xmath14 , composed of the @xmath15 quarks .",
    "a generic state with one neutral kaon will necessarily be a linear combination of these two states .",
    "clearly , the charge transformation ( c ) exchanges @xmath12 with @xmath14 , while the parity transformation ( p ) inverts the 3-momentum .",
    "therefore , the composed transformation cp acting on the state @xmath16 yields the state @xmath17 . given that the physical states correspond to kets which are defined up to a phase @xcite , we may write @xmath18 we name @xmath19 the `` spurious phase brought about by the cp transformation '' . from now on we will consider the kaon s rest frame , suppressing the reference to the kaon momentum .",
    "the states | k_= ( | k^0 e^i | ) [ k_pm ] are eigenstates of cp , corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "let us start by assuming that cp is a good symmetry of the total hamiltonian .",
    "then , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are simultaneously eigenstates of cp , and they should only decay into final states with the same cp eigenvalue .    on the other hand , the states of two and three pions obtained from the decay of a neutral kaon obey * ( ex-1 ) * |&= & | , + cp |_0 & = & - |_0  , [ cp - of - pipi ] where @xmath21 denotes the ground state of the three pion system .",
    "therefore , if we continue to assume cp conservation , we are forced to conclude that @xmath22 can only decay into two pions ( or to some excited state of the three pion system ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath23 can not decay into two pions , but it can decay into the ground state of the three pion system .",
    "since the phase - space for the decay into two pions is larger than that for the decay into three pions ( whose mass almost adds up to the kaon mass ) , we conclude that the lifetime of @xmath22 should be smaller than that of @xmath23 . as a result ,",
    "the hypothesis that cp is conserved by the total hamiltonian , leads to the correspondence |k_+ & &     short - lived ( long - lived ) kaon .",
    "experimentally , there are in fact two kaon states with widely different lifetimes : @xmath24 ; @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this has the following interesting consequence : given a kaon beam , it is possible to extract the long - lived component by waiting for the beam to `` time - evolve '' until times much larger than a few times @xmath26 . for those times , the beam will contain only @xmath27 , which could decay into three pions .",
    "what christenson , cronin , fitch , and turlay found was that these @xmath27 , besides decaying into three pions , as expected , also decayed occasionally into two pions .",
    "this established cp violation .",
    "although this is a 1964 experiment , we had to wait until 1999 for a different type of cp violation to be agreed upon @xcite ; and this still in the neutral kaon system .",
    "events soon accelerated with the announcement in july 2000 by babar ( at slac , usa ) and belle ( at kek , japan ) of the first hints of cp violation in a completely different neutral meson system @xcite ; the @xmath11 meson system , which is a heavier `` cousin '' of the kaon , involving the quarks @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the results obtained by july 2001 @xcite already excluded cp conservation in the @xmath11 meson system at the 99.99% c.l .",
    "part of the current interest in this field stems from these two facts : we had to wait 37 years to detect cp violation outside the kaon system ; and there are now a large number of results involving cp violation in the @xmath0 system  a number which is rapidly growing .",
    "this allows us to probe deeper and deeper into the exact nature of cp violation .",
    "[ generic_exp ] shows a generic @xmath0 physics experiment .",
    "generic @xmath0 physics experiment . , height=288 ]    one produces the initial state ; it time - evolves ; eventually it decays ; and the final state products are identified in the detector .",
    "the experimental details involved in the production of @xmath0 mesons and in the detection of the final state products have taken thousands of dedicated experimentalists years to perfect and can not possibly be discussed in these lectures .",
    "however , one should be aware that therein lie a number of aspects that even theorists must cope with sooner or later : which final state particles are easy / difficult to detect ? ; how do vertexing limitations affect our ability to follow the time - dependent evolution of the initial neutral @xmath11 or @xmath30 meson ? ; if we produce initially a @xmath31 pair , how are these two neutral mesons correlated ? ; how can that correlation be used to tag the `` initial '' flavor of the @xmath11 meson under study ? ; and many , many others issues ",
    "here , we will concentrate on the time - evolution and on the decay .",
    "unfortunately , fig .",
    "[ generic_exp ] already indicates the most serious problem affecting our interpretation of these experiments : the theory is written in terms of the fundamental quark fields ; while the experiment deals with hadrons .",
    "indeed , we will need to calculate the matrix elements of the effective quark - field operators when placed in between initial and final states containing hadrons ; the so - called hadronic matrix elements :  |  o ( )  |   [ quarkvshadron ] because knowing how the quarks combine into hadrons involves qcd at low energies , these quantities are plagued with uncertainties and are sometimes known as the hadronic `` messy '' elements .",
    "this is not to say that all is hopeless .",
    "fortunately , on the one hand , there are a number of techniques which allow us to have some control over these quantities in certain special cases and , on the other hand , there are certain decays which have particularly simple interpretations in terms of the parameters in the fundamental weak lagrangian involving quarks .",
    "but this crucial difficulty means that not all experiments have clean theoretical interpretations and forces us to seek information in as many different decays as possible .",
    "one final technical detail is worth mentioning .",
    "as emphasized before , the kets corresponding to physical states are defined up to an overall phase @xcite ; we are free to rephase those kets at will .",
    "of course , any phenomenological parameter describing cp violation must be rephasing invariant and , thus , must arise from the clash of two phases .",
    "we will come back to this point in subsection  [ sec : usual_three ] .",
    "we are also free to rephase the quark field operators which appear in our theoretical lagrangian .",
    "again , this implies that all cp violating quantities must arise from the clash of two phases and that we must search for rephasing invariant combinations of the parameters in the weak lagrangian .",
    "this is covered in section  [ sec : def_cpv_j ] .",
    "these two types of rephasing invariance have one further consequence .",
    "many authors write their expressions using specific phase conventions : sometimes these choices are made explicit ; sometimes they are not . as a result",
    ", we must exercise great care when comparing expressions in different articles and books .",
    "expressions where these questions become acutely critical will be pointed out throughout these lectures .",
    "we are interested in describing the mixing of a neutral meson @xmath32 with its antiparticle @xmath33 , where @xmath34 stands for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath11 or @xmath30 .",
    "we will follow closely the presentation in @xcite . in a given approximation @xcite",
    ", we may study the mixing in this particle  antiparticle system separately from its subsequent decay .",
    "the time evolution of the state @xmath37 describing the @xmath38 mixed state is given by i |(t)= |(t ) , [ time_evolution ] where @xmath39 is a @xmath40 matrix written in the @xmath38 rest frame , and @xmath41 is the proper time .",

    "thus , we are left with three real parameters ( angles ) and one ( cp violating ) phase in the ckm matrix . in the second procedure ,",
    "we note that there are @xmath261 magnitudes plus @xmath261 phases for a total of 36 parameters in the two yukawa matrices @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",

    "this equation holds in a very general class of models , and is valid separately for the magnitudes and for the phases @xcite .",
    "applying it to the sm model we find that the yukawa couplings lead to @xmath266 real parameters ( which are the 6 masses and the three mixing angles in @xmath259 ) , and to only @xmath267 phase ( which is the cp violating phase in the ckm matrix @xmath259 ) .",
    "it is easy to understand , using either method , that there would be no cp violating phase if we had only one or two generations of quarks .",
    "the fact that there is only one cp violating phase in the ckm matrix @xmath259 has an immensely important implication : within the sm , any two cp violating observables are proportional to each other .",
    "in general , the proportionality will involve cp conserving quantities , such as mixing angles and hadronic matrix elements .",
    "if it involves only mixing angles , it can be used for a clean test of the sm ; if it also involves hadronic matrix elements , the test is less precise .",
    "we will come back to this when we discuss the @xmath1 plane in section  [ sec : rho - eta ] .",
    "a few points are worth emphasizing :    * the existence of cp violation is connected with the yukawa couplings which appear in the interaction with the scalar and , thus , it is intimately related with the sector which provides the spontaneous symmetry breaking ; * because the masses have the same origin , it is also related to the flavor problem ; * the existence of ( no less than ) three generations is crucial for cp violation , which relates this with the problem of the number of generations ; * although in the sm cp is violated explicitly by the lagrangian , it is also possible to construct theories which break cp spontaneously ; * at tree - level , cp violation arises in the sm only through flavor changing transitions involving the charged currents .",
    "hence , flavour diagonal cp violation is , at best , loop suppressed ; * the fact that the sm exhibits a single cp violating phase makes it a very predictive theory and , thus , testable / falsifiable ; * cp violation is a crucial ingredient for bariogenesis and , thus to our presence here to discuss it .    these are some of the theoretical reasons behind the excitement over cp violation , which should be added to the experimental reasons discussed in the introduction .",
    "here we come to two other of those ( perhaps best to be ignored in a first reading ) fine points which plague the study of cp violation .",
    "both were stressed as early as 1966 by lee and wick @xcite .",
    "the first point concerns the consistency of describing p , cp or t in theories in which these symmetries are violated .",
    "for example , the geometrical transformation @xmath268 , corresponding to parity p ( or cp ) , should commute with a time translation . in terms of the infinitesimal generators",
    "@xmath269 and @xmath270 , this translates into @xmath271=0 $ ] , which one recognizes as the correct commutation relation for the corresponding generators of the poincar group .",
    "thus , for a theory in which parity is violated , one can not define parity in a way consistent with this basic geometrical requirements .",
    "a similar reasoning applies to the other discrete symmetries discussed here .",
    "the correct procedure is to define the discrete symmetries in some limit of the lagrangian in which they hold .",
    "this is particularly useful if one wishes to understand which ( clashes of ) terms of the lagrangian are generating the violation of these symmetries .",
    "the second point concerns the ambiguity in this procedure .",
    "first , because we can break the lagrangian in a variety of ways .",
    "second , and most importantly , because there is great ambiguity in defining the discrete symmetries when the theory possesses extra internal symmetries . to be specific ,",
    "suppose that the lagrangian is invariant under some group of unitary internal symmetry operators @xmath272 .",
    "then , if @xmath269 is a space inversion operator , then @xmath273 is an equally good space inversion operator .",
    "a particularly useful case arises when we take this group to correspond to basis transformations , since then one can build easily basis independent quantities violating the discrete symmetry in question .",
    "these observations provide us with a way to construct basis - invariant quantities that signal cp violation , which is applicable to any theory with an arbitrary gauge group , arbitrary fermion and scalar content , renormalizable or not @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is the following :    1 .   divide the lagrangian into two pieces , @xmath274 , such that the first piece is invariant under a cp transformation .",
    "2 .   find the most general set of basis transformations @xmath272 which leaves @xmath275 invariant .",
    "3 .   define the generalized cp transformations at the level of @xmath275 , including the basis transformations @xmath272 in that definition .",
    "these are called the `` spurious matrices '' ( `` spurious phases '' if only rephasings of the fields are included ) brought about by the cp transformations .",
    "4 .   inspired by perturbation",
    "theory , search for expressions involving the couplings in @xmath276 , which are invariant under the generalized cp transformations .",
    "such expressions are a sign of cp conservation ; their violation is a sign of cp violation .    and ,",
    "because the basis transformations @xmath272 have already been included in the definition of the generalized cp transformations , the signs of cp violation constructed in this way do not depend on the basis transformations ; essentially , those basis transformations have been traced over .",
    "this is the method which we will follow below to get @xmath277 . after seeing it in action a few times",
    ", one realizes that steps 3 and 4 may be substituted by @xcite :    * inspired by perturbation theory , build products of the coupling matrices in @xmath276 , of increasing complexity , taking traces over all the ( scalar or fermion ) internal flavor spaces .",
    "since traces have been taken , these expressions are invariant under the transformations @xmath272 .",
    "* those traces with an imaginary part signal cp violation .",
    "below , we will use this second route , in order to get @xmath278 .",
