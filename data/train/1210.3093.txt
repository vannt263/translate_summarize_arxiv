    "this nonmonotonic variation strongly indicates that the excess holes above @xmath7 are mainly doped into the @xmath16 orbital and thus the @xmath4-orbital - based cb - type charge ordering or correlation robustly persist far beyond the fixed point @xmath7 .",

    "@xcite thus , the present behavior in the layered nickelate can be regarded as the hole counterpart to the manganite case , as also expected in the previous work .",

    "<S> charge dynamics and its critical behavior are investigated near the metal - insulator transition of layered - nickelate @xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 ( @xmath3 , eu ) . </S>",
    "<S> the polarized x - ray absorption spectroscopy experiment clearly shows the multi - orbital nature which enables the @xmath4-orbital - based checkerboard - type charge ordering or correlation to persist up to the critical doping region ( @xmath5 ) . in the barely metallic region </S>",
    "<S> proximate to the charge - ordered insulating phase , the nominal carrier density estimated from the hall coefficient markedly decreases in accord with development of the pseudogap structure in the optical conductivity spectrum , while the effective mass is least enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> the present findings combined with the results of recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy show that the pseudogap in the metal - insulator critical state evolves due to the checkerboard - type charge correlation to extinguish the coherent - motion carriers in a characteristic momentum ( * k*)-dependent manner with lowering temperature . </S>"
