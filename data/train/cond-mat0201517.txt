    "the discovery of superconductivity in mgb@xmath7 below an unexpectedly high critical temperature @xmath8 of the order of 40  k@xcite initiated intensive studies of its physical properties .",
    "numerous results indicate that the superconducting state of mgb@xmath7 is conventional in the sense that the electron pairing is mediated by the electron - phonon interaction . in most reports",
    "the superconducting energy gap is claimed to be nodeless , compatible with @xmath9-wave pairing .",
    "however , various types of experiments,@xcite mainly using powder or polycrystalline samples and often surface - sensitive , have given evidence for two gaps of different magnitude in the quasiparticle excitation spectrum of this superconductor .",
    "calculations of the fermi surface of this material@xcite reveal three - dimensional sheets ( @xmath10-bands ) and two - dimensional tubes ( @xmath11-bands ) and it seems quite possible that the gap values for these different parts of the fermi surface differ substantially .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the hole - like quasiparticles on the 2d parts of the fermi - surface experience the larger superconducting gap with a maximum value close to @xmath12 , as predicted by the original weak - coupling bcs theory.@xcite the second and smaller gap is associated with the 3d sheets of fermi surface .",
    "this intriguing situation and other possible anomalous features of this seemingly simple metallic compound ought to be checked experimentally on single crystalline material .",
    "below we present the results of measurements of the thermal conductivity @xmath1 and the electrical resistivity @xmath13 parallel to the basal @xmath0-plane of the hexagonal crystal lattice of mgb@xmath2 as a function of temperature @xmath14 between 0.5 and 300  k , and varying magnetic fields @xmath3 between 0 and 50  koe , oriented both parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath4-axis . in the mixed state ,",
    "the observation of a rapid increase of the electronic thermal conductivity with increasing @xmath3 at constant @xmath15 is consistent with a field - induced reduction of the smaller of the two superconducting energy gaps .",
    "another important observation is that of an unusual nonlinear temperature dependence of the electronic thermal conductivity at @xmath15 in the field - induced normal state , in obvious disagreement with the law of wiedemann and franz .",
    "the investigated single crystal with dimensions of @xmath16 mm@xmath17 was grown with a high - pressure cubic anvil technique , similar to the one presented in ref .   but with a slightly different thermal treatment , described in ref .  .",
    "the high quality of similar crystals from the same batch was confirmed by single crystal x - ray diffraction and energy dispersive ( edx ) x - ray analysis .",
    "a standard uniaxial heat flow method was used for the @xmath18 measurements .",
    "temperatures between 0.5 and 2.4  k were achieved in a non - commercial @xmath17he cryostat and the regime between 2 and 300  k was covered by using a @xmath19he flow cryostat .",
    "the thermometers for monitoring the temperature difference in the @xmath18 measurements were chromel - au+0.07%fe thermocouples with thin wires ( 25 @xmath20 m diameter ) for @xmath21 and a pair of ruthenium oxide thermometers below 2.4  k. in the region of temperature overlap , the results of the measurements of @xmath22 gave identical values for both types of thermometers .",
    "since the thermopower of the au+fe alloy is strongly field - dependent at low temperatures , special efforts were made to ensure a reliable calibration of the thermocouples in magnetic fields .",
    "possible errors due to the thermal conductivity of connecting wires are estimated to be below 1% of the total measured thermal conductivity .",
    "additional measurements of the electrical resistivity @xmath23 in the @xmath0-plane in magnetic fields oriented along the hexagonal @xmath4-axis were made as well .",
    "the electrical resistivity was measured by employing a 4-contact configuration with the same contacts used for measuring the voltage and the temperature difference , respectively .",

    "therefore the data for @xmath33  koe were obtained with the bulk of the sample in the normal state .",

    "the thermal conduction of a superconductor is usually provided by electronic quasiparticles ( @xmath44 ) and phonons ( @xmath45 ) , such that @xmath46 upon decreasing the temperature to below @xmath26 in zero magnetic field , the reduction of the number of unpaired electrons leads to a decrease of @xmath47 and an increasing @xmath45 .",
    "the overall behavior of @xmath22 in the superconducting state depends on the relative magnitudes of @xmath44 and @xmath48 and also on the strength of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "applying external magnetic fields induces vortices in the sample .",
    "the quasiparticles associated with the vortices not only provide additional contributions to phonon scattering and hence a reduction of @xmath45 , but also enhance @xmath47 .",

    "subsequently we discuss @xmath22 in the superconducting state for @xmath32 and finally turn to the data of @xmath5 , measured at constant temperatures in the mixed state , i. e. , @xmath50 .",
    "one of the main problems encountered in the analysis of the thermal conductivity of a conductor is that a separate identification of the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ ekappa ] ) at arbitrary temperature is not straightforward . in the normal state ,",
    "a convenient and often used way to estimate @xmath44 is to employ the wiedemann - franz law ( wfl ) , relating the electrical resistivity and the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity via @xmath51 where @xmath52 w  @xmath53 k@xmath54 is the lorenz number .",
    "the validity of this law requires an elastic scattering of electrons and it is well established that eq .",

    "( [ ewfl ] ) suggests that , at temperatures @xmath56  k , @xmath57 provides about half of the total thermal conductivity .",
    "as we demonstrate below , the applicability of the wfl for mgb@xmath2 at low temperatures is questionable , however .    before discussing the validity of wfl at low temperatures , we note the complications that arise from unusual features in the @xmath23 data shown in fig .",
    "[ r ] , most likely caused by the influence of superconductivity in minor regions of the sample with enhanced @xmath26 and @xmath39 , different from the corresponding bulk values .",
    "the onset of this superconductivity is clearly seen in the upper inset of fig .",
    "[ r ] by inspecting @xmath23 measured in a field of 50  koe , substantially exceeding @xmath58 , the maximum bulk upper critical field of the same sample.@xcite superconducting traces in a minute fraction of the sample may cause a considerable reduction of the total measured electrical resistivity but leave the thermal conductivity virtually unchanged . in this case",
    "a failure of the wfl would not be surprising .",
    "however , because the electrical resistivity of the sample above @xmath26 is practically temperature - independent , we can , with a great deal of certainty , expect that the intrinsic electrical resistivity of _ the bulk _ remains constant also at lower temperatures .",
    "the constant residual resistivity @xmath28 is caused by defects which actually set the maximum mean free path for electrons , independent of temperature .",

    "_ @xcite of @xmath23 measurements on single crystalline mgb@xmath7 at magnetic fields which presumably exceed the upper critical field of the minor phase , demonstrate that in , e.g. , @xmath59 the electrical resistivity remains constant with decreasing temperature down to at least 2  k.    in fig .",
    "[ ke_est ] , we plot as a solid line , the normal - state electronic thermal conductivity @xmath60 below 8  k , calculated using eq .",
    "( [ ewfl ] ) with the experimental value @xmath61 for @xmath62 .",
    "the measured total thermal conductivity , shown by open circles , is considerably higher than @xmath60 across the entire covered temperature range . for the estimate of the upper limit of the phonon contribution",
    "we assume that the minima of @xmath5 shown in fig .",
    "[ hsweeps ] are caused by the competition of a decreasing @xmath45 and an increasing @xmath47 . with this interpretation",
    "it is clear that the values of @xmath63 represent at most the maximum value of the lattice contribution @xmath45 .",
    "the smooth interpolation between these minimum values of @xmath5 for different temperatures , denoted as @xmath64 , is shown as the broken line in fig .",
    "[ ke_est ] .",
    "the difference between the measured thermal conductivity at @xmath65 and the upper limit of the phonon contribution , @xmath66 , obviously representing the lower limit of the electronic contribution , is shown in fig .",
    "[ ke_est ] by open squares .",
    "it may be seen that at least below 8  k , the electronic contribution is considerably larger than predicted by wfl . with increasing temperature , @xmath67 approaches the wfl prediction , as is demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ ke_est ] .",
    "nevertheless , it is impossible to identify the temperature limit where the validity of the wfl is recovered if such a limit exists at all . considering our procedure",
    "it is clear that the true electronic contribution exceeds our estimate , particularly towards the upper end of the considered temperature range .",
    "however , at very low temperatures where @xmath68 ( e. g. , at 0.60  k the zero field thermal conductivity is less than 6% of the normal - state thermal conductivity ) , @xmath67 must be very close to the true @xmath47 .",
    "thus the observed deviation from the wfl and in particular its temperature dependence , revealing a peak - like structure of @xmath69 vs @xmath14 , shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ ke_est ] , is a reliable result of our investigation .",
    "the violation of the wiedemann - franz law at low temperatures is very unusual because the validity of this law is expected to hold for the fermi - liquid ground state of common metals .",
    "a similar set of data of hill an coworkers for ( pr , ce)@xmath2cuo@xmath70 was interpreted as evidence for a breakdown of the fermi - liquid theory for this oxide material.@xcite the non - fermi - liquid behavior of cuprates was speculated to be the consequence of possible spin - charge separation , a scenario that is considered in relation with high-@xmath26 superconductivity.@xcite the same arguments are hardly relevant for the case of mgb@xmath7 where a spin - charge separation is not expected .",
    "another explanation for the results of ref .",
    "was recently offered in ref .  .",
    "it was argued that a peak - type structure of @xmath69 plotted versus @xmath14 might be the consequence of some kind of transition leading to a gap formation in the electronic excitation spectrum of the normal state .",
    "this scenario would lead to a peak of @xmath69 at @xmath71 , close to the transition temperature , an exponential decrease of @xmath69 below @xmath71 , and a gradual approach to the wiedemann - franz value of @xmath72 at @xmath73 .",
    "such a peak at @xmath74 indeed follows from our analysis of the mgb@xmath7 data ( see the inset of fig .  [ ke_est ] ) .",
    "unfortunately our data set does not extend to low enough temperatures in order to confirm the exponential temperature dependence of @xmath47 well below @xmath71 .",
    "= 1      a rather unexpected feature in the temperature dependence of @xmath1 in zero magnetic field is the absence of even the slightest manifestation of the transition at @xmath75 , as has already been mentioned in previous reports on @xmath22 for polycrystalline materials.@xcite this observation is quite unusual for superconductors with non - negligible phonon heat transport , because the opening of the superconducting gap rapidly reduces the rate of phonon scattering on electrons and should lead to a fast increase of @xmath45 below @xmath26 . the assumptions that either the phonon - electron scattering is much weaker than phonon - defect scattering , or that @xmath45 is negligibly small in the vicinity of @xmath26 , which , in principle , might explain the absence of a @xmath22 feature at @xmath26 , are all incompatible with the observation that applying a relatively weak external magnetic field of 0.63  koe , introducing some additional quasiparticles in the cores of vortices , considerably reduces the thermal conductivity at intermediate temperatures ( see fig .  [ tsweeps ] ) .",
    "the possibility that the enhancement of @xmath76 below @xmath26 is exactly compensated by a reduction of @xmath47 , is not considered because , for a bcs superconductor , the slope change in @xmath77 at @xmath26 is much more pronounced than that in @xmath57.@xcite the latter statement is not true for special cases of extremely clean samples of strong - coupling superconductors , such as pb and hg,@xcite where the scattering of electrons by defects is negligibly small . our sample of mgb@xmath7 with @xmath78 can not really be regarded as fulfilling the extreme clean limit criteria .",
    "it is possible , however , to account for both the absence of a feature in @xmath22 at @xmath26 and the obvious slope change in @xmath22 centered around 6  k , by postulating that the superconducting energy gap @xmath79 for quasiparticles which strongly interact with low - frequency phonons , is considerably smaller than the values given by the bcs theory .    in the simplest approximation",
    ", the phonon thermal conductivity can be calculated as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the mean sound velocity , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the specific heat and the average relaxation time of a phonon mode with frequency @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "the total phonon relaxation rate may be calculated by assuming that the simultaneous influence of all independent phonon scattering mechanisms @xmath85 can be accumulated in the form @xmath86 the phonon - electron relaxation time @xmath87 changes most rapidly upon the opening of the superconducting gap . in ref .",
    ", the phonon - electron scattering time in the superconducting state takes the form @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the normal - state relaxation time .",
    "the function @xmath90 is quite complicated , but its main feature is a step - like increase of the phonon relaxation rate at the phonon frequency @xmath91 , a consequence of the fact that a phonon with an energy less than @xmath92 can not brake a cooper pair and interacts only with quasiparticles that have already been excited above the gap.@xcite in the `` dominant phonon '' approximation@xcite it is assumed that , at temperature @xmath14 , the main contribution to the heat transport in the lattice is due to phonons with frequencies close to @xmath93 , where @xmath94 . for weak - coupling bcs superconductors , where @xmath95 and @xmath79 is a standard function tabulated in ref .",
    ", @xmath96 is always fulfilled at the temperature @xmath97 , i. e. , not far below @xmath26 .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath77 increases rapidly below @xmath26 , leading to a maximum of the measured @xmath1 , typically close to @xmath98.@xcite for mgb@xmath7 , instead of a peak near @xmath98 , @xmath22 exhibits a distinct feature at about @xmath99 , which can also be regarded as a peak - type structure on top of the background which decreases monotonously with decreasing @xmath14 .",
    "this suggests that the relevant superconducting energy gap is equal to @xmath100 at much lower temperatures than @xmath97 .",
    "hence , for the quasiparticles which scatter phonons most effectively , the energy gap @xmath79 is about 3 times smaller than the values given by the original bcs theory .    in principle , more information could have been extracted from our data by direct comparison with existing theories for the thermal conductivity in multiband superconductors.@xcite however , since the wfl seems to be invalid in the normal state of mgb@xmath7 at low temperatures , any attempt to analyze @xmath22 quantitatively in the superconducting state is hampered by the difficulties in separating @xmath47 and @xmath45 in a reliable manner .      before discussing the features of @xmath1 in magnetic fields ,",
    "it is important to note that the zero - field values of @xmath1 at temperatures @xmath15 are almost entirely due to the phonon contribution .",
    "the electronic thermal conductivity in the superconducting state @xmath101 can be estimated using the theory of bardeen , rickayzen , and tewordt @xcite . in their model @xmath102 where @xmath103 as well as @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "using for @xmath106 the values of @xmath107 shown in fig .",
    "[ ke_est ] , and taking into account the lowest previously claimed value of @xmath108  mev , @xcite it may be shown that @xmath109 is negligibly small below 4  k , and therefore , @xmath110 .    as it may clearly be seen in fig .",
    "[ hsweeps ] , the @xmath5 curves reveal very similar features at all temperatures below 8  k. the most intriguing aspect of these curves is the very rapid increase of @xmath1 at relatively weak fields , after the initial decrease of @xmath45 .",
    "this increase is undoubtedly due to a field induced enhancement of the number of electronic quasiparticles and thus to an increase of @xmath47 . for common type ii superconductors in their mixed state , the features of @xmath111 are expected to depend on the ratio between the electron mean free path @xmath112 and the coherence length @xmath113 . a rough estimate of @xmath112 can be obtained from the residual resistivity @xmath28 employing the drude relation @xmath114 $ ] , where @xmath115 is the electronic density of states at the fermi level and @xmath116 is the average in - plane component of the fermi velocity . using the values @xmath117 ( ref .  ) and @xmath118 ( ref .  ) , we obtain @xmath119 . since this value is considerably larger than the in - plane coherence length @xmath120 ( ref .  ) , our sample is in the moderately clean limit . in this limit",
    ", @xmath47 is expected to be small at all fields below @xmath39 , except close to @xmath39 , where it grows according to @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the normal - state electronic thermal conductivity above @xmath39 and @xmath123 is a temperature - dependent coefficient.@xcite as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ hsweeps ] , for mgb@xmath7 , the largest positive slope @xmath124 is observed well below @xmath39 for both orientations of the magnetic field .",
    "although the form of eq.([eclean ] ) implies that @xmath5 should scale with the value of @xmath39 , the thermal conductivity depends only weakly on the field direction up to approximately 6  koe .",
    "this is amazing because the anisotropy of the upper critical field @xmath125 at low temperatures.@xcite    for @xmath41 , after a steep initial increase , @xmath5 reaches a region where it exhibits only a relatively weak @xmath3-dependence .",

    "therefore the region of weak @xmath3-dependence extends to the highest fields reached in this study .    the field dependence of @xmath47 ,",
    "although very different from what one would expect from a conventional superconductor , can qualitatively be explained in terms of a two - band model with two energy gaps of different magnitude associated with each band .",
    "nakai and co - authors@xcite analyzed such a model where one band with strong pairing ( @xmath129-band ) is responsible for superconductivity , and superconductivity in the second band ( @xmath130-band ) is induced by cooper pair tunneling .",
    "consequently , the two bands are characterized by a smaller gap @xmath131 and a larger gap @xmath132 , and normal - state electronic densities of states at the fermi level @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "the analysis presented in ref .",
    "shows that the quasiparticle states in the vortices are highly confined in the @xmath129-band but only loosely bound in the @xmath130-band .",
    "therefore the quasiparticle states of the vortices in the @xmath130-band start to overlap already in weak fields and the resulting density of states equals that of the normal - state @xmath133 at @xmath135 .",

    "this model explains very well the behavior of the electronic specific heat in a magnetic field.@xcite the field - induced suppression of the smaller gap is claimed to be consistent with the results of point - contact measurements@xcite and recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments.@xcite in terms of the two - gap model , the saturation of the thermal conductivity much below @xmath39 may be regarded as the result of the closing of the energy gap in the @xmath130-band .",
    "the heat transport via quasiparticles of the band associated with the larger gap is significant only in the vicinity of @xmath39 , and , eventually , above @xmath39 the full normal state electronic heat transport is restored .",
    "the lack of a substantial dependence of @xmath47 on the field orientation for @xmath135 is an obvious consequence of the weakly anisotropic 3d nature of the @xmath10-bands . from this",
    "we conclude that the smaller gap must open in the @xmath10-band .",
    "the rapid increase of the number of quasiparticles in the @xmath10-bands also naturally explains the very fast drop of @xmath136 in small fields , because the corresponding excited quasiparticles are the dominant scattering centers for phonons at low temperatures .",

    "our @xmath18 data provide evidence for a rapid field - induced enhancement of quasiparticles in the superconducting state of mgb@xmath7 well below @xmath39 , consistent with an efficient field - induced closing of the smaller energy gap , thus provoking a fast growth of the electronic thermal conductivity . at higher fields",
    ", the growth of @xmath111 tends to saturate until , in the vicinity of @xmath39 , the contribution to @xmath1 from the electrons of the band associated with the larger energy gap grows rapidly , merging into the practically field - independent thermal conductivity in the normal state above @xmath39 .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the electronic thermal conductivity of the field - induced normal state is nonlinear in @xmath14 and deviates considerably from the prediction of the wiedemann - franz law .",
    "this deviation peaks at about 1  k , suggesting the existence of some transition provoking a gap formation in the electronic excitation spectrum close to this temperature .",
