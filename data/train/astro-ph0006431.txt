    "the quest for high  redshift ( @xmath3 ) clusters of galaxies has recently received a lot of attention , and several search methods have been put forward .",
    "the mere existence of rich clusters of galaxies at very high redshifts is cosmologically relevant and their importance as a discriminant among different theoretical cosmological models is widely acknowledged ( see viana @xmath4 liddle @xcite ; carlberg @xcite ; bahcall , fan @xmath4 cen @xcite ; bartelmann @xcite ) . on the other hand , a detailed study of the properties of clusters , as well as of their member galaxies , at high redshifts and the confrontation of these with local well - known systems gives precious insight on their formation and on the evolution of their properties with redshift and environment ( dressler @xcite ; van dokkum @xcite , @xcite ; smail @xcite ; morris @xcite ; stanford @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the now well - established evolution of galaxies with redshift still lacks a clear understanding of the physical processes that guide it : clusters are privileged observational targets to distinguish between intrinsic and environmental effects .    to perform the search for distant clusters of galaxies , various authors",
    "have been taking advantage of several windows in the spectral emission of the different cluster components , namely galaxies and gas , and applying the best suited method in each case .",
    "thus , optical , near ir , x  ray and even variations in the cosmic microwave background emission have been used to detect cluster candidates at distant redshifts .",
    "all different methods have advantages and drawbacks and the key is to view them as complementary .",
    "describing each one of them and presenting their respective pros and cons is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to recall what has been done up to now , in order to place our work in the actual scenario of these researches .    among the different techniques that basically search for surface density enhancements on the galaxy 2d spatial distribution - adding or not magnitude information as well - , some of the most popular ones are the application of adapted filters ( kernel , wavelets , matched filters ) , counts - in - cells techniques , percolation algorithms or even , lately , voronoi tessellation , on optical photometric data ( schectman @xcite ; lumsden @xcite ; dalton @xcite ; escalera @xmath4 macgillivray @xcite , @xcite ; pisani @xcite ; lidman @xmath4 peterson @xcite ; fadda @xcite ; postman @xcite ; gal @xcite ; ostrander @xcite ) , and on nir data ( stanford @xcite ; mendes de oliveira @xcite , ramella , nonino @xmath4 boschin @xcite ) . apart from these more or less elaborate techniques ,",
    "simpler high - contrast methods still prove to be successful ( couch @xcite ) , but they probably do nt sample adequately the full distant cluster population and their selection criteria are not well defined .",
    "some of these algorithms benefit also from - or are mainly based upon - multiband colour information that helps isolating red galaxies at higher redshifts ( gladders & yee @xcite ) .",
    "very significant results have been achieved _ via _",
    "the search for sources of extended emission in x  ray surveys with detection algorithms which are designed to probe a broad range of cluster parameters such as x  ray flux , surface brightness and morphology ( henry @xcite with emss ; rixos by castander @xcite ; the rdcs by rosati @xcite , @xcite ; nep by henry @xcite ; gioia @xcite ; warps by scharf @xcite ; jones , scharf , ebeling @xcite ; sharc by collins @xcite ; the bcs by ebeling @xcite ; the cfa large area survey by vikhlinin @xcite , @xcite ; reflex by bhringer @xcite ) .",
    "other emerging strategies for cluster search include : the detection of extragalactic background light fluctuations in shallow optical images ( dalcanton @xcite ; zaritsky @xcite ) ; deep imaging around privileged sites of density enhancements such as distant powerful radio - galaxies or radio - loud quasars ( le fvre @xcite ; deltorn @xcite ) ; narrow  band imaging to search for concentrations of ly@xmath5 emitters around previously known weak radio qso s at high redshift ( pascarelle @xcite ; campos @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the detection of decrements in the cosmic microwave background radio emission were also attributed to the presence of distant gaseous systems , possibly clusters ( jones , saunders , baker @xcite ; richards @xcite ) , that scatter the microwave background radiation _ via _ the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect ( sunyaev @xmath4 zeldovich @xcite ) .",
    "one should mention , though , that these strategies for cluster search refer to @xmath6 systems and we ignore _ `` whether these are massive , collapsed systems , groupings within unvirialized `` sheets '' of galaxies , or collections of `` protogalactic '' fragments destined to merge into single , more massive galaxies '' _ ( dickinson @xcite ) .",
    "+ if one aims at producing statistically significant results , a good catalogue of clusters , preferably spanning a large interval of redshift , obtained using well defined selection criteria , over a reasonable sky area , is needed .",
    "our algorithm , by uniformly detecting clusters over a wide range of redshifts and cluster sizes , is well suited to provide such a catalogue .",
    "we stress that it does not aim , however , at performing accurate estimates of neither the redshift nor the richness of the cluster candidates .",
    "the eso imaging survey ( eis , renzini @xmath4 da costa @xcite ) , covering a final area of @xmath7 square degrees of the southern sky in the i - band , up to limiting magnitude @xmath8 , provided us with a good opportunity to produce such a catalogue .",
    "we have developed an automated cluster search algorithm and applied it to the catalogues derived from the eis imaging data to obtain a reliable set of cluster candidates up to estimated @xmath9 . having a list of robust candidates is highly desirable , before proceeding to the spectroscopic observations with very large telescopes , and our algorithm has a high success rate - that is , a high completeness level - without being overwhelmed by contamination in the form of spurious detections .",
    "we have already selected three of the highest redshift candidates ( @xmath10 ) and performed the spectroscopic follow - up with vlt , confirming their real existence as physically bound systems ( discarding the possibility of false chance alignments ) and determined their distance / redshift with accuracy .    in this paper",
    "we describe our algorithm in section [ algoritmo ] , stressing its strong points and advantages relatively to others present in the literature .",
    "applying it to the eis - wide data of patches a and b produced a catalogue of candidate clusters of galaxies that we present in section [ catalogos ] .",
    "this set is quite different from the one produced by the eis  team of eso for the same original data set but using a different approach and in section [ compolsen ] we fully investigate all possibilities that may account for such a discrepancy .",
    "final remarks are given in section [ fim ] .",
    "we shall use @xmath11 km  s@xmath12mpc@xmath12 and @xmath13 throughout this paper , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "in their pioneering work on the palomar distant cluster survey , postman and collaborators ( postman @xcite , p96 hereafter ) wrote a matched filter algorithm to identify cluster candidates by using positional and photometric data simultaneously .",
    "slight variants have been proposed hence , with differences lying in some details of the detection processes ( kawasaki @xcite ) or in the generalization of the algorithm so as to render it applicable to any type of survey data ( kepner @xcite ) .",
    "our work , instead , tries to improve on the p96 algorithm in the sense of removing the _ a priori _ assumptions that are implicit in the postman technique .",
    "the p96 algorithm relies on the choice of both a given cluster profile - modified ",
    "hubble or king  like ( hereafter often referred to as king filter for simplicity ) - with a typical cluster scale - the core radius @xmath14 - and a cut  off radius , and of a typical @xmath15 - the chosen parameterization of the schechter function . both quantities ,",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 , are * rigidly coupled * to detect cluster candidates and assign them a tentative redshift .",
    "each one of these quantities being a function of distance ( and thus cosmology ) , their implementation on any algorithm implies a dependence on the adopted cosmology and on the chosen amount of evolution , not to mention the dependence on the particular values actually chosen for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    in our new algorithm * the spatial and luminosity part of the filter",
    "are run separately and successively * on the catalogue , with * no assumption * on the typical size or typical @xmath15 for clusters .",
    "in fact , these parameters intervene in our algorithm only as a typical angular scale and typical apparent magnitude @xmath16 , bearing no ties to fixed physical scales nor to absolute magnitudes through redshift dependence .",
    "this has the consequence of removing the need for a choice of fixed physical values for these two quantities , and for a choice of evolutionary models .",
    "moreover , the fact of not coupling the space and the luminosity parameters also enables us to reach higher values of completeness : a candidate can be retrieved even if it does not flag a maximum likelihood at the very same redshift value simultaneously for both the space and the luminosity distributions ( a situation that would lower its global likelihood when using the p96 algorithm ) .",
    "one further advantage consists in the * local estimate of the background * for each cluster candidate . in the approach of p96",
    ", the magnitude distribution is assumed constant all over the catalogue and so is the background spatial density .",
    "this may be hazardous especially in what concerns the spatial part , where local inhomogeneities may hamper the detection in shallower regions of the catalogue . due to varying observing conditions ,",
    "a part of the eis data , at least , is reported to be non uniform ( olsen @xcite ) , so this feature of our algorithm is of great help , as it allows us to tackle the problems of inhomogeneous data sets and to achieve higher levels of completeness . + in our algorithm local enhancements in the projected galaxy density are first selected through the gaussian filtering , and a `` spatial probability '' of them being spurious is computed .",
    "subsequently , the maximum - likelihood `` filtering '' on the apparent magnitudes searches for the presence of a schechter distribution superimposed on the local background ( which follows a power  law instead ) .",
    "this second step leads to the assessment of a corresponding `` luminosity probability '' that , multiplied by the spatial one , produces the final probability of each candidate being a spurious one .",
    "this means that the lower this value , the more confident the candidate . notice also that this final quantity is always lower than either one of the partial spatial or luminosity probabilities as it is their product . + we will now discuss in detail the components of the algorithm .      in the spatial part we have chosen to work with a * gaussian filter*. this choice , while avoiding to specify too particular a shape for the profile of the cluster candidates , brings along all the advantages and favorable mathematical properties of the gauss function .",
    "it is worth remembering that the gaussian function in fourier space is more compact than the king function . as a consequence",
    "the convolution with a random distribution of galaxies ( a white noise in fourier space ) will produce less spurious detections for the gauss filter than for the king filter .    regarding completeness",
    ", it can be interesting to show , using simulations , the relative advantages of the gaussian filter with respect to the king filter .",
    "a simple way of doing it is to simulate an area with randomly distributed field galaxies where to embed clusters , and apply to this area the two spatial filters in question to perform cluster detection and to compare directly completeness for both of them .",
    "comparing the two filters is not straightforward , though : their shapes are intrinsically different so that there is no direct correspondence between the respective typical scales ( @xmath14 and @xmath17 ) .",
    "the king  like profile has a slimmer central peak with broad wings while the gaussian shows the well known bell  shaped form .",
    "however , when cross - correlating the two filters , the highest signal is achieved if we consider @xmath18 , suggesting that a factor of @xmath19 should be used in the simulations when comparing the relative efficiency of the gauss _ versus _ king filters . besides , since when searching for a spatial density enhancement one has to move in steps of dimension comparable to the typical scale of the filter , this also implies that the gaussian filtering requires a factor of @xmath20 less search points with respect to the king filtering .",
    "as we have already mentioned , in our search we will not fix any typical physical size for our filter , but we will use , instead , a range of angular sizes @xmath17 , namely from @xmath21 up to @xmath22 arcmin in five steps of ratio @xmath23 .",
    "these values were chosen bearing in mind the range of reasonable dimensions of the cluster candidates spanning the redshift interval that we expect to probe with the eis data ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the corresponding five @xmath14 values to be used in the spatial search with the king  like filter are those obtained using the relationship @xmath25 .",
    "the simulations performed for this comparison were done as a function of the signal - to - noise threshold chosen , of the cluster profile , richness and redshift .    as the final goal was to apply our algorithm to the eis data , to simulate the galaxy background distribution we used the data from the eis itself ( see section [ catalogos ] ) , by random shuffling galaxy positions and magnitudes within the limits of the survey .",
    "the contamination rates were assessed by running the gaussian filter and the king filter on these pure background fields .    in",
    "what regards completeness , this rate was assessed by running the two filters on the background fields plus cluster galaxies .",
    "this means that , for each simulation , a cluster of galaxies with different characteristics was placed randomly within each background frame , with the only constraint of being at adequate distance from the frame borders ( a distance larger than both 10 times the @xmath17 used for the search as well as 5 times the angular size of the embedded cluster ) , in order to avoid border effects .",
    "the characteristics of the clusters were defined according to the following prescription :    * the cluster mean redshift : ranging from @xmath26 till @xmath27 at intervals of @xmath28 . * the surface density profile : a power law in radius of the form @xmath29 .",
    "the index @xmath30 was set to three different values ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) when testing the spatial filter only ( as is the case of this section ) .",
    "but it was fixed to the typical in  between case @xmath34 for the overall simulations ( further ahead , in section [ overallcomplete ] , when we will apply the complete algorithm - that is , both spatial and luminosity filters - to the mock catalogues ) ; this provided a compromise that also allowed a direct comparison with the p96 results .",
    "furthermore , we introduced a small central smoothing region in the profile , with the typical size of a cluster cd galaxy ( @xmath35 kpc , the average diameter of the two central giant galaxies in coma , as provided by the ned - database ) , to avoid a cusp .",
    "both @xmath36 and the total radial size of the cluster , @xmath37 mpc , were translated into the corresponding angular sizes according to the redshift chosen in item 1 . doubling",
    "the cluster size to @xmath38 mpc did not change the results of our simulations in terms of completeness . * the luminosity function - a schechter , which is generally adopted to describe the luminosity distribution of cluster galaxies ( schechter @xcite ) , but with parameters determined by colless ( @xcite ) for a set of @xmath39 clusters of mean redshift @xmath40 observed in the @xmath41 band .",
    "thus , the faint end slope is @xmath42 and the characteristic apparent magnitude , at that mean redshift , is @xmath43 when converted to the i - band ( fukugita @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath44 used in each simulation was changed according to the redshift ( item 1 ) and to the k - correction applied ( see item 5 below ) .",
    "* the richness , as given by @xmath45 , the number of galaxies brighter than the characteristic magnitude @xmath16 .",
    "three cases were considered : @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( following schechter @xcite ) .",
    "these can be roughly identified with abell richness classes @xmath48 , @xmath38 and @xmath49 ( abell @xcite ; see also bahcall @xcite ) . * the dominant morphological type , as implied by the k - correction that is used .",
    "actually only one extreme case was tested : clusters entirely composed of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we deliberately chose to ignore both the evolutionary corrections and the possibility of having later morphological types as the cluster dominant population , since this would correspond to a more favorable scenario of rendering cluster members brighter , which would only facilitate their detection .",
    "k - corrections have been provided by the spectro - photometric evolutionary model _ pegase _ of fioc @xmath4 rocca - volmerange ( @xcite ) tuned to the cosmology parameters adopted .",
    "once these characteristics are fixed , we can compute , for each cluster , the number of member galaxies that are observable within the apparent magnitude limit .",
    "positions and magnitudes are next assigned to these cluster galaxies by random shots drawn from items 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "this was done in sets of @xmath50 simulations and the two spatial filters were applied to these mock catalogues .",
    "both field and cluster galaxies were limited to a magnitude cut  off of i=@xmath51 , the one we adopted also for the eis data .",
    "+ in terms of completeness , the results are summarized in figures [ fig : gkprofilepm1 ] and [ fig : gkrichnessr2 ] .    according to the plots in figures [ fig : gkprofilepm1 ] and [ fig : gkrichnessr2 ] , the comparative performance in completeness rate shows that the gaussian filter is more efficient in most of the cases than the king filter , and this is especially true in particular in the difficult case when the cluster profile is less peaked .      to assess the signal given by the luminosity information we apply a maximum - likelihood technique on the apparent magnitude distribution of the candidates previously found with the spatial filter .",
    "we use as functional form for the luminosity function a schechter ( @xcite ) function expressed in apparent magnitudes , thus avoiding the p96 choice of an intrinsic @xmath15 and the choice of a given cosmology ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) and morphological content ( translated in the assumption of a given k - correction and , eventually , of an e - correction as well ) . also , unlike p96",
    ", we have decided to implement the generalized treatment for this likelihood filter , following schuecker @xmath4 bhringer ( @xcite ) .",
    "this complete treatment uses the exact mathematical equations , allowing to keep track of all possible errors that would affect any eventual direct redshift estimate ( like the one performed by p96 ) .",
    "it does not add major computational effort nor time .",
    "besides , it also renders unnecessary the final _ `` cluster signal correction '' _ demanded by the complex approximations of the p96 procedure .",
    "we thus took equation ( 8) of schuecker @xmath4 bhringer ( @xcite ) and adapted it to compute the likelihood for this luminosity part of our algorithm . notice",
    "that , as we decouple it from the spatial part , the galaxy distribution profile is suppressed from the original formula so that the final log - likelihood ratio , for a given @xmath16 , is :    @xmath54\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( 1 )    where @xmath55 stands for the likelihood function , @xmath56 and @xmath57 refer to the schechter function parameterized by a given @xmath16 , @xmath58 stands for the background galaxies and @xmath59 for the differential magnitude number counts of the background galaxies ; @xmath59 is mathematically described by the fit to the magnitude distribution of all galaxies in the catalogue .",
    "n is the total number of cluster and field galaxies present inside a @xmath60 radius circle , where we also estimate a coarse richness parameter @xmath61 ( as will be detailed in section [ descricao_algoritmo ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath62 has been normalized , :    @xmath63    @xmath64 being the limiting magnitude of the catalogue .    for each candidate",
    "we compute the log - likelihood ratio ( equation [ eq : like ] ) for different @xmath16 values , set within the limits of magnitude of the galaxy catalogue by steps of @xmath65 magnitude .",
    "the slope of the schechter function is fixed to @xmath42 , according to the mean value derived by colless ( @xcite ) and in agreement with typical cluster luminosity function parameters found in the literature since the work of schechter ( @xcite ) . by identifying the absolute maximum in the distribution of the log - likelihood ratios relative to all @xmath16",
    ", we automatically select the output @xmath16 for that candidate .      in this section",
    "we present a detailed description of the way the algorithm works when applied to the data .",
    "we note that we shall often interchange probability with the complementary gaussian percentile and the associated level of standard deviations , referred to as @xmath66 throughout this paper .",
    "this approximation was used also in p96 so , by adopting it as well , we render comparisons among our results easier .",
    "the algorithm starts off by reading the coordinates and magnitudes of the galaxies present in a magnitude limited catalogue .",
    "then , for each one of the five selected angular apertures @xmath17 of the gaussian , the code :    * builds the search grid for the spatial filter analysis . the spacing between adjacent grid points",
    "is @xmath17 but no grid point is allowed within @xmath67 of the catalogue s borders in right ascension nor in declination .",
    "* computes a first hand estimate of the local background density associated to each grid point by counting the number of galaxies in a circle with a @xmath68 radius centered at the grid point in question .",
    "( all cases of grid points distant less than @xmath69 from the catalogue s borders are obviously corrected by shifting the circle . )",
    "notice that , in this way , the background spatial density is not assumed constant all over the catalogue , but is estimated around each point .",
    "this characteristic proves to be particularly efficient in dealing with data - like those of eis in at least some of the patches - where varying observing conditions result in non homogeneity of the galaxy catalogue ( olsen @xcite ) .",
    "* performs the gaussian filtering at each grid point considering all galaxies within @xmath67 from it and weighing their relative position through the gauss function .",
    "the resulting output signal is normalized ( respective mean subtracted and division by the corresponding standard deviation ) , obtaining the @xmath66 appropriate for each grid point .",
    "* selects all grid points which flag a local maximum , , for which the spatial signal is greater than that of all their immediate grid neighbours .",
    "no points at the extremes of the grid are allowed in this choice , thus avoiding `` border effects '' .",
    "the signal must also be above a given threshold , imposed as an input in the programme .",
    "we set this spatial detection threshold to @xmath70 ( the equivalent to the @xmath71th percentile ) .",
    "* for these maxima , our algorithm proceeds to the fine centrage : the gaussian filtering is redone , maintaining the filter angular size , but building a finer grid in an iterative procedure ( down till an eighth of @xmath17 ) around the tentative candidate .",
    "the fine tuned center is finally chosen as the position where the spatial signal is maximized in the ensemble of the points of this denser grid . * the five different scale catalogues are cross - correlated in order to remove double detections .",
    "detections are considered double if the distance between their centers is lower than or equal to the mean of their scales . in this case , only the highest signal detection is kept . * for each selected candidate , the next step is to obtain a preliminary estimate of its richness , @xmath61 , to be used in the computations of the likelihood of the luminosity part ( see equation [ eq : like ] ) .",
    "@xmath61 is the approximate number of galaxies statistically belonging to the cluster candidate .",
    "we obtain it by subtracting to the n galaxies inside a @xmath60 radius the local background , estimated in a annulus around each candidate .",
    "this ring has an inner radius of @xmath72 and its area totals @xmath73 deg@xmath74 .",
    "these values were chosen after evaluating the galaxy density distribution around several candidates in the final eis catalogue . * for each candidate we compute the log - likelihood ratio ( equation [ eq : like ] ) for the set of @xmath16 values and determine the one that maximizes it . the probability associated to this value",
    "is obtained by bootstrap : the catalogue is randomized , the spatial filter is run on it and the distribution of the log - likelihood for the flagged spatial detections is computed thus allowing an estimate of the probability of having an @xmath75 greater or equal than that measured for our candidate .",
    "* at this point we possess the @xmath17 and @xmath16 that independently maximize both the spatial and the luminosity signals and their respective significance , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "we can combine these probabilities to obtain a final global probability , @xmath78 , for the detection of each cluster candidate .",
    "this is simply done by multiplying @xmath76 by @xmath77 .",
    "the estimate of the richness of our cluster candidates is an important step , as we would like to quantify the percentage of groups _ versus _ rich clusters that we will be detecting .",
    "whichever richness estimate one decides to adopt , a necessary step is the determination of a physical radius for each cluster candidate which , in turn , requires the estimate of its redshift . unlike p96 , our method does not provide a direct estimate of the redshift for our candidates .",
    "we obtained such estimate using @xmath16 and its relationship to @xmath15 , whose adopted value is that reported by colless ( @xcite ) , to be redshifted and corrected using the k - corrections typical of ellipticals , as determined by fioc @xmath4 rocca - volmerange ( @xcite ) .",
    "simulations show that the value of @xmath16 obtained through our algorithm retrieves well the @xmath15 introduced in the simulations - see figure [ fig : msz ] . on the contrary ,",
    "the value of @xmath17 retrieved by our algorithm does not correlate well with redshift : the angular size chosen by the algorithm has a large scatter with respect to the physical size of the clusters entered in the simulations .",
    "having thus obtained a rough estimate of the candidate s redshift , we can also estimate its richness , adopting the @xmath79 parameter proposed by bahcall ( @xcite ) .",
    "it consists in counting the number of cluster member galaxies brighter than @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 is the magnitude of the third brightest cluster galaxy ) , located within a projected radius of @xmath82 mpc from the cluster center , the typical size of a cluster x  ray emitting region .",
    "background correction is estimated from similar counts performed in the entire catalogue region , using @xmath83 magnitude bins .",
    "@xmath79 was found to be well correlated with the system s velocity dispersion @xmath84 by bahcall ( @xcite , see also alonso @xcite for further studies on this type of correlation ) for a sample of @xmath85 nearby clusters ranging from rich systems ( @xmath86 ) to small groups of galaxies ( @xmath87 ) and has already been used in the literature for richness estimates of distant clusters ( deltorn @xcite ) .",
    "it has the advantage of avoiding the higher uncertainties in background subtraction present when adopting the standard abell ( @xcite ) estimate , which is performed within a radius of @xmath49 mpc ( see p96 for comments on this ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath79 is relatively insensitive to uncertainties in either the background correction or in the exact position of the cluster center ( bahcall @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath79 can be translated into the typical abell richness classes using the indicative relation given by bahcall ( @xcite ) , @xmath88 , and then checking table 1 of bahcall ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that @xmath89 corresponds to abell richness class @xmath90 , while @xmath91 is equivalent to @xmath92 .",
    "we ran a new set of extensive simulations in order to assess the overall efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "the layout of these simulations being the same as the ones that were used for estimating the completeness and contamination rates of the spatial filter alone ( see section [ simspatial ] ) , we shall not repeat their details . here",
    ", it will be enough to mention that the mock catalogues ( pure field for contamination rates or field plus cluster galaxies for completeness purposes ) were now submitted to the algorithm , and not only to its spatial filter as had been done in section [ simspatial ] .",
    "+ the results regarding the overall completeness rates are shown in figure [ fig : completeness ] . even setting the detection threshold at @xmath93 - which renders contamination rates negligible ( see below for the final overall rate of contamination directly assessed on the eis data )",
    "- we are able to achieve a completeness of @xmath94 until @xmath95 for richness 2 coma - like clusters , and of @xmath96 up to @xmath97 for poorer richness class 1 systems . for @xmath98 clusters such high values of completeness hold even in the redshift bin @xmath99 , always for the no - evolution case .",
    "these results improve on the values obtained using the p96 algorithm ( see their figure @xmath100 ) .",
    "in fact , while we set the schechter slope of the simulated clusters to a steeper value ( @xmath101 instead of @xmath102 ) , the fact of having adopted a brighter magnitude limit ( @xmath51 _ versus _ p96 s @xmath103 ) renders a direct comparison of both works plausible .",
    "we checked this by integrating both schechters for the two magnitude limits , thus getting 38(us ) _ versus _",
    "50(p96 ) galaxies for r=1 clusters , 63 _ versus _ 82 galaxies for r=2 clusters , and 100 _ versus _ 131 galaxies for r=3 clusters .",
    "moreover , do notice that the cut  off @xmath66 is actually very different : while we set this threshold to @xmath104 , p96 report as detection limit the 95th percentile ( approximately the @xmath105 level ) in their simulations . +    as for the expected contamination rate",
    ", we ran our algorithm on the eis catalogue after having randomized galaxy positions and magnitudes .",
    "this time , no clusters were added to the galaxy background distribution , as we were interested in the false detection rate associated to a given threshold @xmath66 .",
    "these simulations supply @xmath106 spurious candidates per square degree if the threshold is set at @xmath107 , and @xmath108 per square degree if it is set at @xmath109 .",
    "p96 report an estimated contamination rate for their final catalogue ( of @xmath110 candidates ) of at most @xmath111 in their @xmath112 square degree area , corresponding to a surface density of contaminants of @xmath113 per square degree for pdcs .",
    "however , a direct comparison between the two results is very difficult since the data are different and the algorithms have very different selection methods .",
    "our final catalogues contain the following entries for each one of the candidate clusters found in eis - wide patches a and b : right ascension and declination ( equinox 2000 ) , indicative angular size @xmath60 ( in arcmin ) , combined total probability expressed as a @xmath66 , @xmath16 , redshift and richness ( @xmath79 ) estimates .",
    "+      eso provides on the web the single frame catalogues for the even and the odd coverage of the eis patches ( http://www.eso.org/science/eis/ ) .",
    "we thus had to assemble these data and build two galaxy catalogues ( henceforth the even and the odd ) for each entire patch , that were the basis for the cluster searches .",
    "after careful inspection of the eis data characteristics , we decided to adopt the following parameters to define the galaxy catalogue on which to perform our automated search .",
    "the star / galaxy separation line was drawn at @xmath114 : only the objects with stellarity index lower than this value were kept , irrespective of their magnitude .",
    "let us notice that this criterion slightly differs from that adopted by olsen ( @xcite , @xcite ) , where all the objects at magnitude fainter than 21 were kept , irrespective of their stellar index , introducing a sharp step at i=21 in the galaxy number counts .",
    "+ we excluded objects with @xmath115 and nflag / npix @xmath116 ( where @xmath117 are the sextractor flags , npix the number of pixels above the analysis threshold and nflag the number of pixels flagged by weightwatcher - see nonino @xcite for details ) .",
    "the layout of the eis mosaic is such that adjacent odd / even frames have a small overlap at the edges , especially in declination and we further did cure double detections in frame borders ( for pixel values @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 or @xmath121 ) using a @xmath38 arcsec separation cut  off .",
    "we limited the data set to @xmath122 , aiming at guaranteeing a high level of completeness of the data .",
    "we note that nonino ( @xcite ) estimate that the single - frame odd and even catalogues are @xmath123 complete to @xmath124 for a typical eis frame .",
    "+ finally , and for technical reasons , we trimmed each patch so as to have clear - cut rectangular edges .",
    "this translates into the limits given in table [ tab : patchlimits ] , and in the following number of galaxies : 57366 for patch a  even , 57553 for patch a ",
    "odd , 25456 for patch b  even and 25445 for patch b  odd . in summary , we have four catalogues , two ( the even and the odd ) for each patch , where we shall independently run our algorithm",
    ".    .limits of the regions to be analyzed by our algorithm ( coordinates are expressed in equinox j2000 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     also for patch b holds the discussion already made for _ class 2 _ candidates in patch a. it is to be noticed that now the ratio of _ class 2 _ to _ class 1 _ candidates is much lower than the one obtained for patch a : @xmath125 or a percentage of @xmath126 of the total sample ( _ versus _ the previous @xmath127 ) , suggesting that the quality of the ccd data available for patch b is indeed much more homogeneous .",
    "we note here that the same type of ratio produced with olsen s candidates for this patch is @xmath128 or , in terms of percentage of their whole sample , @xmath129 , which remains quite similar to the figure they produce for patch a.    adding _ class 1 _ to _ class 2 _ candidates gives a total of @xmath130 cluster candidates in patch b , corresponding to a surface density of @xmath131 per square degree , with , again , the already mentioned @xmath132 expected spurious detections per square degree . out of these @xmath130 systems , 62 % have estimated richness class @xmath133 , and 38 % have @xmath134 , as illustrated in the lower panel of figure [ fig : n05hist_aandb ] .",
    "notice that , the area probed here being smaller than the one of patch a , at the same limiting magnitude this translates into a smaller sampled volume .",
    "so it is expected that the median typical richness of the detected systems should move to lower values .",
    "the corresponding total redshift distribution is plotted in the bottom of figure [ fig : zhist_aandb ] .",
    "the median of the redshift distribution for _ class 1 _ candidates , patch a and b considered together , is @xmath135 , similar to that of olsen despite having chosen a brighter cut  off in magnitude for the galaxy catalogue ( @xmath136 _ versus _ their @xmath137 ) , while it is slightly deeper than that of the p96 sample pdcs ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "+ there is only one cluster candidate in patch b detected by previous independent works and listed in ned .",
    "it is cluster @xmath139 , that was selected as a _ class 1 _ candidate by us .",
    "we estimate @xmath140 for the redshift of this candidate ( and a corresponding richness class @xmath141 ) , while spectroscopic measurements in the literature hold a value of @xmath142 ( the ned database ) and @xmath143 . also for patch b , a more detailed comparison between our catalogue of cluster candidates and that of olsen ( @xcite ) will be presented in section [ compolsen ] .",
    "we can now do a thorough comparison with the results that olsen ( @xcite , @xcite ) obtained by applying the p96 algorithm to patches a and b of eis . in this way we will also be able to assess directly the relative efficiency of the two algorithms ( p96 and ours ) on the same set of data .",
    "we will have to do a double check : first which of our candidates are new with respect to the olsen lists , and then which of the olsen candidates are missing from our lists .",
    "for the comparison to be fair , we have to remember three important points : olsen and co - workers did their search on the total galaxy catalogue , up to magnitude @xmath124 , while we preferred to limit it to @xmath144 .",
    "they applied a @xmath66 cut  off of 3 , while we adopted a @xmath66 cut  off of 4 in our final cluster list and , finally , they also imposed a cut  off in richness to their candidates , while we apply no such sort of selection .",
    "bearing this in mind , we proceed with the comparisons .",
    "+ regarding patch a , in our _ class 1 _ list we have 13 candidates in common with olsen ( @xcite ) , while in the _ class 2 _ list we have only 3 candidates in common . out of our remaining candidates , 6 from _ class 1 _ and 9 from _ class 2 _",
    "are in an area of patch a that they decided to cut  out from their search ( the upper right corner of their figure 2 ) because of _ `` obvious incompleteness '' ( sic)_. we did search also in this area , since our algorithm , using local background values , is better suited for dealing with inhomogeneous data .",
    "we therefore are left with 22 _ class 1 _ candidates and 17 _ class 2 _ candidates present in our list and missing in theirs .",
    "some of these missing candidates might have been discarded by olsen ( @xcite ) because of the richness cut  off they imposed , but it should be noticed that amongst them there are also relatively rich systems : 5 with estimated richness @xmath145 and 25 with richness @xmath141 ( conservatively counting only our @xmath79 secure values ) , whose absence is thus not easy to justify .",
    "+ in what concerns patch b , we only have 7 candidates in common with olsen ( @xcite ) , all in our _ class 1 _ list .",
    "we are therefore left with 14 _ class 1 _ candidates and all 8 _ class 2 _ candidates present in our catalogues and missing in theirs .",
    "+ on the other hand , there are candidates present in the olsen lists that we failed to select , and we wanted to check if our missing them could be related to the different magnitude cut  off of the galaxy catalogue used for our search or to the different @xmath66 cut  off adopted .    to investigate this we decided to check which would have been the @xmath66 obtained for these missing candidates by our algorithm on the galaxy catalogue limited to their deeper magnitude cut  off ( @xmath146 ) . to do this we simply targeted directly the search to the positions of each one of their candidates .",
    "by doing so , we were able to retrieve all their patch a candidates with a @xmath147 in at least the even or the odd catalogue ( the same selection criterion they adopted ) , with the only exception of four of them .",
    "one of those was commented by olsen as being a _ `` doubtful case based on the visual inspection of the coadded image '' _ and to another one our algorithm could only attribute a lower limit @xmath66 ( from the spatial part ) .    in patch b , with the same procedure , we assigned all their candidates a @xmath148 except for three ( one of them being also a case of lower limit @xmath66 obtained from the spatial filtering ) .",
    "the plot of our @xmath66 against theirs , for all the candidates we retrieved ( common candidates ) , is shown in figure [ fig : sntargetsolsenab ] , both for patch a ( filled symbols ) and patch b ( empty symbols ) objects .",
    "one can notice that , for the majority of the cases , our @xmath66 is greater than that obtained by olsen as would be expected : by decoupling the spatial and the luminosity parts of the algorithm , a candidate can be retrieved even when it does not flag a maximum likelihood at the very same redshift value simultaneously for both distributions , a situation that would lower its global likelihood when using the p96 algorithm .",
    "+ another interesting plot is the one showing , for the common candidates , our @xmath16 estimate _ versus _ the redshift estimate by olsen ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig : ms_z_23 ] plots the mean value ( from the even and the odd catalogues ) of @xmath16 produced by our algorithm against the redshift estimated by olsen for their candidates in patch a ( filled circles ) and in patch b ( empty circles ) .",
    "the line indicates the redshifted value of the colless ( @xcite ) local mean @xmath16 , affected by k ",
    "correction typical of ellipticals ( as determined by fioc @xmath4 rocca - volmerange @xcite ) .",
    "the general distribution of the data points does seem to follow the curve s trend .",
    "the larger redshift systematically predicted by the colless relationship we used is just a byproduct of the brighter @xmath15 estimated by colless ( @xmath149 for @xmath150 km  s@xmath12mpc@xmath12 ) _ versus _ the one used in p96 and by olsen ( @xmath151 , also for @xmath150 km  s@xmath12mpc@xmath12 ) .",
    "this fact may also be contributing to the discrepancies between our estimates and the literature measures in the case of the abell clusters mentioned in section [ cands ] .",
    "in this paper we presented a new algorithm for cluster detection that improves on the p96 one , mainly by avoiding the need to assume a typical physical size or a typical @xmath15 for galaxy clusters .",
    "these two parameters intervene in our algorithm only as typical angular scales and a typical apparent magnitude @xmath16 , bearing no ties to fixed physical scales nor to absolute magnitudes through redshift dependence ( and chosen cosmological model ) . one further advantage of our algorithm with respect to p96 s consists in the local estimate of the background for each cluster candidate , particularly useful in the spatial part where local inhomogeneities ( due to varying conditions during data acquisition ) may hamper cluster detection in shallower regions of the catalogue . + we applied this new algorithm to the eis - wide database and did a thorough comparison with the results obtained using p96 on the same kind of data . as the eis observing conditions varied considerably throughout the granted nights",
    ", there was a considerable spread in the data - quality of different eis frames ( nonino @xcite ) .",
    "both the particular features of the algorithm presented in this paper , that somehow compensate for the lack of homogeneity of the data , and the conservative limiting magnitude adopted for cluster search try to minimize the problems inherent to the eis data , allowing to achieve a higher completeness level than that obtained using p96 on the same data .",
    "+ in fact , we notice that the distribution of our patch a candidates seems more homogeneous than the one presented by olsen ( @xcite ) : compare our figure [ fig : mapdets_a ] with their figure @xmath152 , where they have a region around @xmath153 , @xmath154 devoid of detections , not to mention the fact that they intentionally left out a part of the patch when running their algorithm to `` overcome '' data problems related to the lack of homogeneity .",
    "+ regarding the cluster candidate surface density , a precise comparison with the values presented in the literature is not trivial , due to different magnitude limits adopted for the search and to the fact that we did not apply any _ a priori _ selection on cluster richness ( as p96 for example ) . just as a qualitative comparison , let us remember that the pdcs group ( p96 ) reports the detection of @xmath110 cluster candidates over an area of @xmath112 square degrees till @xmath155 , or a number density slightly above @xmath156 .",
    "this value is consistent with the observed x ",
    "ray @xmath157 around fluxes @xmath158 erg @xmath159 s@xmath12 ( see figure  3 of rosati @xcite ) . in this paper , adding _ class 1 _ to _ class 2 _ candidates both for patch a and b we obtain a surface density of @xmath160 clusters per square degree , out of which @xmath161 54% have @xmath48 or above , which agrees well , within the uncertainties , with the number quoted by the pdcs group , possibly suggesting a slightly larger surface density for our candidates , especially when taking into account the deeper magnitude limit adopted for the search by the pdcs group .",
    "+ we are doing multicolor ( b , v , r and i ) observations of the sample of cluster candidates presented in this paper using the 3.6-m and ntt eso telescopes .",
    "redshift confirmation of three of our high redshift ( @xmath162 ) candidates has already been obtained using fors at the vlt , confirming the efficiency of the strategy adopted .",
