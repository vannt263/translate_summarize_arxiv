    "the first - ranked or brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are uniquely positioned at the centre of the gravitational potential of clusters of galaxies . with brightnesses roughly ten times that of @xmath1 galaxies , bcgs are not simply the bright extension of a schechter luminosity function ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "they are predominantly elliptical in their morphology and owing to their extreme luminosities and position , they dominate their host cluster visually , forming a unique population in their own right . however , their evolution and how their environment affects that evolution , are still poorly understood .    in previous papers of this series on the k - band photometric properties of bcgs ; @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite : we observe that bcgs in clusters with an x - ray luminosity @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ( in the emss passband @xmath4 kev with @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) are brighter and more uniform than those in their low x - ray luminosity counterparts at redshifts @xmath7 .",
    "it appears from @xcite that the evolutionary history of bcgs depends on the richness of their cluster environment , with bcgs in the most luminous clusters showing little sign of merging since @xmath8 and those in the least luminous clusters showing significant signs of mass growth over the same timescale .",
    "however , the mass accretion rates inferred in @xcite rely on the assumption that increases in luminosity are attributable to increases in mass .",
    "it is important to confirm this result to determine whether the mass evolution of bcgs is dependent on their environment .",
    "if bcgs are in dynamical equilibrium then changes in mass should produce changes in size .",
    "therefore , a means to test the assumption of increases in luminosity being attributable to mass accretion , and confirm the results from @xcite , is to measure the structural parameters ( size and surface brightness ) of bcgs with respect to the properties of their host cluster environment .",
    "many authors have studied the effects of mergers on galaxy surface brightness profiles since @xcite suggested that dynamical friction , and the consequent merging , of pairs of disc galaxies could form elliptical galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the de vaucouleurs @xmath9 surface brightness profile @xcite is robust to the effects of mergers @xcite .",
    "the profile of the remnant is only disturbed with respect to the de vaucouleurs prediction at radii greater than the effective radius and these disturbances move outwards with time , disappearing within the dynamical timescale of the galaxy .",
    "@xcite observed that the @xmath10-band light distribution of ngc7252 , a galaxy which appears to have undergone a recent merger , had already established an @xmath9 profile . @xcite and @xcite examined @xmath11-band surface brightness profiles of merger galaxies and merger remnants , all confirming that the structure of the mergers more closely resembled that of elliptical galaxies than spiral bulges .",
    "more recently , mergers between elliptical galaxies have been simulated in order to understand the observed tilt of the fundamental plane ( fp ; between radius , surface brightness and velocity dispersion ) with respect to the virial theorem .",
    "these simulations find that the effective radius of merger remnants increases with total mass  ( e.g. @xcite ) , with the surface brightness , consequently , decreasing .",
    "equal - mass dissipationless merging of simulated elliptical galaxies produces structurally non - homologous remnants and is , therefore , able to reproduce the observed fp @xcite .",
    "these studies suggest that galaxies become larger and more diffuse as a function of merger events .",
    "observations of the kormendy relation ( between radius and surface brightness ; @xcite ) of bcgs show that they lie off the relationship followed by normal cluster elliptical galaxies , having larger radii and lower mean surface brightnesses than is predicted by simply scaling the relationships followed by normal elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , they do lie on the same fp as normal cluster ellipticals @xcite .",
    "these observations are consistent with the suggestion that bcgs have undergone an increased merger history with respect to normal cluster elliptical galaxies .",
    "there are also suggestions that the de vaucouleurs effective radii of bcgs correlate with their environment .",
    "@xcite fitted de vaucouleurs @xmath9 laws to the surface brightness profiles of 17 bcgs with redshifts @xmath12 in the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands .",
    "they find a correlation between effective radius and local galaxy density ( measured as the number of galaxies brighter than @xmath16 in circles of projected radii equal to 200 kpc ) in the sense that larger bcgs are found in environments which are locally denser at the present epoch .",
    "few other studies have taken environment into account so it is unclear what role environment plays in the structural differences observed between normal cluster elliptical galaxies and bcgs .    in this paper",
    "the structural properties of bcgs are measured to further examine how the properties of bcgs depend on their host cluster environment , with the aim of interpreting their evolutionary history .",
    "this analysis uses a larger sample of objects covering a significantly wider range in environmental density than previous studies .",
    "an objective measure of environmental density is vitally important in any study of bcg properties . as the cluster x - ray luminosity is proportional to the volume integral of the square of the density of the intra - cluster medium it provides a quantitative measure of the environmental density of bcgs with which to analyse possible environmental dependences .",
    "we also make use of near - infrared imaging with its associated benefits of small evolutionary corrections and low galactic extinction    the sample is outlined in section  [ sample_4 ] along with a description of the reduction of the data .",
    "the analysis techniques are presented in section  [ analysis_4 ] .",
    "the results obtained are introduced in section  [ pet_kormendy ] and discussed in section  [ discuss_4 ] and the conclusions drawn from this paper are presented in section  [ summary_4 ] .",
    "following on from the photometric analysis in @xcite the aim was to construct a sample of bcgs in x - ray selected clusters with a wide range of x - ray luminosities .",
    "structural analysis requires high resolution images and to achieve this our analysis is primarily concerned with the structural properties of bcgs at redshifts @xmath0 .",
    "the @xcite sample consists of 78 bcgs with redshifts @xmath17 in clusters selected from einstein medium - sensitivity survey ( emss ; @xcite ) and the serendipitous high - redshift archival rosat cluster ( sharc ; @xcite ) x - ray cluster catalogues .",
    "these galaxies were observed in the @xmath11-band with the infra - red camera 3 ( ircam3 ) on the united kingdom infra - red telescope ( henceforth ukirt ; 1 pixel = 0.281@xmath18 giving a field of view of 72@xmath18 ) between 1994 and 1998 .",
    "eleven of these bcgs are at redshifts @xmath19 ( all from the emss catalogue ) and , therefore , suitable for use in this analysis .",
    "in contrast to the analysis in @xcite it was not possible to use the 2mass extended source catalogue @xcite for this analysis .",
    "2mass only provides one surface brightness measurement and the two images it provides are not adequate for a structural analysis : the postage stamp images are scaled to the size of the galaxy and are too small to analyse to a reasonable radius .",
    "the images from the actual scans , have a scale of 1@xmath18/pixel which is too large to provide a meaningful analysis .    therefore , to extend this analysis a further 26 bcgs with redshifts @xmath20 selected from the lynam catalogue @xcite",
    "were observed over 3 nights ( 14 - 16 january 2001 ) in the k@xmath21-band with the quick infra - red camera ( quirc ) on the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope ( henceforth uh ; 1 pixel = 0.189@xmath18 giving a field - of - view of 193@xmath18 ) .",
    "these bcgs are in clusters selected from the northern _ rosat _ all - sky x - ray cluster survey ( noras ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ukirt and uh data were reduced in the same manner and a brief overview of this process is given below .",
    "as there are two galaxies in common between the uh and ukirt samples ( those in the clusters ms0301 - 7 and ms0904 - 5 ) this gives a total sample of 35 bcgs , all with redshifts @xmath0 .",
    "the data reduction was performed using the iraf / dimsum ( deep infrared mosaicing software um ) package .",
    "the individual frames were masked for bad pixels , dark subtracted and divided by the exposure time .",
    "a flat field image was created by median combination of the object images , or separate sky exposures if these were available , and applied to the object frames .",
    "masking of cosmic ray events was performed on the flattened images before they were mosaiced together , which completed the processing of those objects with sky exposures .",
    "otherwise the mosaic , which is substantially deeper than the individual exposures , was used to create an object mask , which was then applied to the individual images before they were median - combined to form a flat .",
    "the flattened images were then processed as above to create the final image .",
    "observations of stars from the ukirt faint standards list @xcite were used to calibrate the ukirt photometry onto the ukirt system assuming an extinction of @xmath22 mag airmass@xmath3 , the median value for k - band observations at mauna kea .",
    "the uh images were calibrated using observations of standard stars selected from the ukirt extended faint standards list @xcite .",
    "at least 7 different standards were observed at least 3 times each night . with little variation over the 3 nights",
    ", the observations were combined to give an atmospheric extinction coefficient of @xmath23 mag airmass@xmath3 and a zero - point of @xmath24 with a standard deviation @xmath25 mag .",
    "one of the major problems in measuring the structural properties of any galaxy type is systematic errors in the measurement of the sky levels ( e.g. @xcite ) as even the smallest excess flux can swamp the galaxy flux in the outer annuli , and oversubtraction results in a truncation of the profile .",
    "this problem is increased when analysing bcgs , due to their larger size and the fact that , locally , bcgs are observed to have significant amounts of flux in their outer wings @xcite .    in this analysis",
    "the sky levels were calculated using sextractor @xcite . in this program",
    "the sky level is estimated by constructing a grid and estimating the background within each square with a sigma - clipped mean .",
    "the grid is then median filtered to remove the effects of large bright objects .",
    "a grid size of 64 pixels and a median filter size of @xmath26 grid squares was used here in order to avoid the background estimation being affected by the presence of other galaxies .",
    "this method was compared with measuring the background by obtaining the median of the counts measured in small annuli at different points around the image , the difference was of the order of 10 per cent in @xmath27 calculated by sextractor and no systematic offsets were observed .",
    "owing to their position at the centres of clusters of galaxies , bcgs are often surrounded by many other galaxies .",
    "it is important not to incorporate the light of these galaxies when measuring the surface brightness profile of the bcg . in order to avoid this problem",
    ", the flux from the neighbouring galaxies needs to be carefully excluded from the images . when fitting surface brightness profiles in 2d it is possible to deconvolve each galaxy and subtract the flux due to the curves of growth of the companion galaxies , replacing the actual bcg flux in each excluded pixel with that calculated using its symmetric counterpart about the centre of the bcg ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , this assumes that the bcg is symmetric and that there is not a further object affecting the counterpart position .    to reduce systematic uncertainties in this analysis",
    "these assumptions were not made .",
    "pixels that were identified as belonging to a contaminating source were excluded from the profile calculation . the exclusion radius around each source was initially set to twice the semi - major axis of the contaminating source ( as reported by sextractor ) .",
    "these apertures were then inspected by eye , and the exclusion radii of those sources close to the bcg centre were reduced , since the bcg flux close to the centre is so high that flux from other galaxies is insignificant .",
    "the galaxies were then fitted with elliptical isophotes using the iraf task ellipse ( @xcite ; e.g. @xcite ) which calculates the _ median _ intensity within each isophote , further reducing the effect flux from companion galaxies can have on the profile of the bcg .",
    "the centres of the ellipses were fixed while the position angles and ellipticities were allowed to vary freely .",
    "ellipse was allowed to run until either the angular extent of an elliptical annulus reached the width of the image or greater than 75 per cent of the pixels in a single annulus were masked out .",
    "intensities differing from the median by more than 2 standard deviations were excluded to ensure the quality of the data being fitted .",
    "the radii were then circularized ( @xmath28 ) and converted from arcseconds to @xmath29 kpc assuming a wmap cosmology @xcite : @xmath30 , @xmath5 and @xmath31 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 with @xmath32 .",
    "petrosian structural parameters ( @xcite ) have a number of advantages over those calculated from fits of models ( e.g. de vaucouleurs law , srsic law ) to the surface brightness profile .",
    "in particular , no assumption of the stellar light distribution is made in their calculation , making them a direct measure of galaxy properties , from the local surface brightness .",
    "the petrosian parameters are also relatively insensitive to zero - point errors and errors in the extinction correction , as is clear from the petrosian relationship : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the surface brightness ( in magnitudes ) at a radius @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the mean surface brightness within @xmath35",
    ". figure  [ eta_profile ] shows some example @xmath37 profiles .",
    "the error bars indicate the @xmath38 statistical errors on @xmath39 calculated by combining the measured errors on @xmath34 and @xmath40 in quadrature .",
    "the petrosian radii and surface brightness can be measured from the @xmath39 profile at a chosen value of @xmath39 .",
    "the choice of @xmath39 value to use depends on the sample : @xmath41 should be large enough to be unaffected by seeing ( @xmath42 ; @xcite ) but not so large that the surface brightnesses are noisy and unduly sensitive to sky subtraction errors .",
    "figure  [ eta_profile ] illustrates that the errors on the @xmath39 parameter increase with @xmath39 , and @xcite find larger errors in their @xmath41 at @xmath43 than at @xmath44 .",
    "the images for this analysis have seeing of @xmath45 and the images have typical limiting depths of k@xmath46 mag arcsec@xmath47 , therefore , petrosian parameters calculated at @xmath44 satisfy both of these requirements .",
    "this results in a sample of bcgs with petrosian radii in the range @xmath48 and surface brightnesses 19.5 mag arcsec@xmath49 mag arcsec@xmath47 .",
    "the average petrosian surface brightness @xmath50 was calculated by summing the counts within @xmath41 and averaging over the area enclosed .",
    "@xmath50 was then corrected for cosmological dimming ( @xmath51 ^ 4 $ ] ) and galactic absorption using the maps of @xcite ; the absorption correction is small , typically @xmath52 mag .",
    "the surface brightnesses were also k - corrected using model predictions from the gissel96 code @xcite , following @xcite .",
    "these k - corrections also include an evolutionary correction , assuming pure luminosity evolution from a redshift of formation , @xmath53 .",
    "the results are unchanged if the formation redshift is increased to @xmath54 .",
    "the effects of masking companion galaxies and excluding points with large errors in their intensities mean that it was not possible to calculate @xmath55 for 2 out of the 35 bcgs in this sample , both in clusters with x - ray luminosities @xmath56 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "this leaves a total sample of 33 bcgs with @xmath20 in clusters with x - ray luminosities @xmath57 erg s@xmath58 .",
    "the distribution of the x - ray luminosities of the host clusters of these 33 bcgs is shown in figure  [ lx_distrib ] .",
    "this illustrates both the range of host cluster environment covered , over one order of magnitude in x - ray luminosity , and that this range remains consistent over the redshift range studied .",
    "the petrosian structural parameters for these 33 bcgs are given in table  [ struc_table_eta ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in order to understand what the observed correlation between petrosian radius and host cluster environment means in terms of bcg formation and evolution , the effect that mergers have on the surface brightness profiles of galaxies is considered .    as introduced in section  [ intro ] , equal - mass , dissipationless mergers of simulated elliptical galaxies produce structurally non - homologous remnants and are , therefore , able to reproduce the observed fp of elliptical galaxies @xcite . however , these simulations are unable to reproduce the projections of the fp , the faber - jackson and kormendy relations",
    ". the faber - jackson relation is characterized by a lower velocity dispersion than predicted by the faber - jackson relation for a given luminosity increase and the kormendy relation by significantly larger radii than predicted from observations @xcite .",
    "these simulations are , however , consistent with observations of bcgs .",
    "bcgs also lie on the fp for normal cluster elliptical galaxies @xcite but are observed to have significantly lower velocity dispersions than predicted by the faber - jackson relation for normal cluster elliptical galaxies @xcite and larger radii than predicted by the normal cluster elliptical galaxy kormendy relation @xcite .",
    "this suggests that bcgs can form from equal - mass , dissipationless mergers of large luminous elliptical galaxies",
    ". however , gas dissipation must be important in the formation of less massive elliptical galaxies in order to increase their central velocities , consistent with the observed faber - jackson and kormendy relations .",
    "numerical simulations of elliptical galaxy mergers indicate that the effective radii of merger remnants increase proportionally with total mass , by a factor of @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "there is a range of increase factors because the properties of the remnant are dependent on the energy and angular momentum of the collision as well as the mass ratios of the progenitors .",
    "head - on , equal - mass dissipationless mergers produce the largest remnants , with effective radii double those of their progenitors ( e.g. @xcite ) . from the predictions of current simulations , the observation that bcgs in high x - ray luminosity clusters",
    "are larger , by a factor of @xmath60 , than those in low x - ray luminosity clusters at redshifts @xmath0 then suggests that these galaxies have undergone one or two major ( equivalent mass ) merger events , or several accretion events , more than those bcgs in low-@xmath61 clusters .",
    "figure  [ eta_profile ] indicates that bcgs with cd morphologies have larger petrosian radii than would be measured if they followed perfect de vaucouleurs profiles .",
    "therefore , the bcg radius  cluster x - ray luminosity relationship could also suggest that there are a higher proportion of bcgs with cd morphologies in high x - ray luminosity clusters than there are in low x - ray luminosity clusters .",
    "higher resolution images would be required to determine this in a non - subjective manner .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the density profiles of the remnant galaxies remain the same as those of their progenitors , therefore , the effective surface density should scale as @xmath62 @xcite . in magnitudes",
    ", this corresponds to a change in @xmath63 of up to 1 mag arcsec@xmath47 in 2 consecutive equal - mass mergers between elliptical galaxies , as predicted by the simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the corresponding change in surface brightness predicted is within the observational scatter of this data , explaining the lack of a clear correlation of bcg mean surface brightness with host cluster environment .",
    "@xcite concluded that bcgs in high x - ray luminosity clusters showed little sign of an increase in mass since @xmath8 , in contrast to those in low x - ray luminosity clusters which have increased in mass by up to a factor of four over the same timescale . combining the results presented here with those of @xcite a consistent picture emerges .",
    "these two observations suggest that bcgs in high x - ray luminosity clusters assembled their stellar mass at redshifts @xmath64 and have been passively evolving since , in contrast to those bcgs in low x - ray luminosity clusters which are still in the process of assembling today .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the theories of hierarchical structure formation which suggest that the less massive systems ( clusters and galaxies ) we observe today assembled more recently than the most massive systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , the petrosian parameters measured from the surface brightness profiles of 33 bcgs in clusters covering a wide range in environmental density have been presented , with the aim of interpresting their evolutionary history .",
    "analysis of the petrosian @xmath39 profiles of this sample indicates that there is a deviation of the petrosian profiles of some bcgs with cd morphologies from those of a galaxy following a perfect de vaucouleurs law .",
    "this is suggested to be a signature of galaxies with cd morphologies and may indicate a fundamental structural difference .",
    "the structural properties of bcgs are clearly determined by their host cluster environment , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "bcgs in high x - ray luminosity clusters are larger and fainter than those in low x - ray luminosity clusters .",
    "research into other cluster galaxy populations suggests that their properties are driven , not by the global cluster environment , but by their local environment as measured by the density of their nearest neighbours , with those galaxies in the least dense environments , showing the most signs of evolution .",
    "the unique position of bcgs means that their local environment _ is _ the global cluster environment and this affects their evolution such that those bcgs in the least dense environments have undergone more evolution since @xmath8 than those in the most dense clusters .",
    "this provides an indication of how a single population of galaxies evolves hierarchically .",
    "it is likely that bcgs arise from the merging of satellites , initially drawn towards the cluster centre by collimated infall along filaments in the early epochs of cluster formation , however , this work suggests that this process is continuing in the least dense clusters at the present time .",
