    "the basic operations of a quantum logic device can be described in its _ computational space _ defined by a set of degrees of freedom which can be prepared ( write ) and measured ( read ) and of course evolve coherently . however",
    "the hilbert space of the device is much larger than the computational space , and effects of the additional degrees of freedom may be relevant for the reduced dynamics we aim to control  @xcite .",
    "these environmental degrees of freedom may be `` internal '' to the device , which is a many - body object , or `` external '' , belonging to the read / write circuitry or to auxiliary devices ( buses or other idle or working qubits ) .",
    "they determine loss of coherence , which is ultimately due to the entanglement between system and environment  @xcite .    much of the effort in the analysis of decoherence in quantum logic devices has been focused on model environments made of many weakly coupled harmonic oscillators  @xcite .",
    "the key feature of these linear models is that the effects on the reduced dynamics of the system can be described in terms of simple statistical information on the environment , spectral densities or power spectra , even if a detailed knowledge of its microscopic structure is not known  @xcite .",
    "however a slightly more detailed knowledge of the environment dynamics is needed in certain situations , for instance if the environment has memory on the time scale of the system dynamics  @xcite .",

    "they have been recognized as the major source of decoherence in recent experiments  @xcite demonstrating quantum coherent dynamics in superconducting devices .",
    "such an environment has been modeled in ref .",
    "@xcite , with a set of fano impurities  @xcite which randomly polarize the device . a peculiar effect of this environment , related to its non linear nature ,",
    "is that the reduced qubit dynamics shows various qualitatively different regimes depending on the switching rate of the impurities .",
    "in particular dephasing due to slow impurities is not described by a single rate and memory effects of the environment enter the qubit dynamics .",
    "the main goal of this work is to discuss a situation where the reduced dynamics of the system is able to probe different regimes of the environment dynamics . to this end",
    "we introduce a model which exhibits tunable crossover effects .",

    "the hamiltonian @xmath12 represents a spin - boson model  @xcite , which describes a two state system with tunneling amplitude @xmath13 and bias @xmath14 coupled to a set of harmonic oscillators .",

    "the hamiltonian eq.([hamiltonian ] ) is very rich and may model many different physical problems . in this work",
    "we will regard @xmath6 as describing a qubit coupled with an environment consisting of a bistable impurity ( @xmath7 ) described by the sb model , @xmath12 .",
    "we are primarily interested in the reduced dynamics of the qubit , resulting from tracing out all the environmental degrees of freedom , i.e. the harmonic modes _ and _ the spin @xmath7 .",
    "physically @xmath6 may represent a josephson quantum logic device where external voltage gates and magnetic fields are used to tune the effective charging energy @xmath16 and josephson coupling @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the environment may be a charge close to the device undergoing phonon - assisted tunneling between two positions .",
    "we will consider an ohmic spectral density @xmath18  @xcite , i.e. we choose a set of free bosons such that the power spectrum of the collective coordinate @xmath9 is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the high frequency cut - off of the harmonic modes .",
    "the case of ohmic spectral density is interesting because the sb model has a rich phase diagram resulting in an environment where memory effects may be tuned by the temperature @xmath21 .",
    "we will present results for @xmath1 focusing on nonzero temperatures , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the renormalized tunneling amplitude in @xmath12  @xcite . physically this regime describes a sb impurity active in producing decoherence for the qubit @xmath6 . from a technical point of view this regime requires some care .",

    "the low temperature regime , which may describe a working two - qubit gate , has been investigated using the standard secular master equation  @xcite . instead for temperatures @xmath28 our model may describe a working qubit ( @xmath6 ) coupled with a idle qubit ( @xmath7 )",
    "not perfectly switched off .",
    "finally the spin @xmath31 may represent a measuring device  @xcite for the mesoscopic system described by @xmath12 .",
    "this picture is an alternative framework for our work , namely the reduced dynamics of @xmath6 provides the result of the measurement on a sb system .",
    "if the coupling @xmath8 is weak and the dynamics of the sb is fast enough only the power spectrum of the coupling operator @xmath32 @xmath33 enters the dynamics of @xmath6 , whereas if the sb has a slow dynamics the spin @xmath6 is able to detect also details of the dynamics of @xmath34 which go beyond @xmath35 .",
    "we consider the pure dephasing regime @xmath36 where @xmath37 = 0 $ ] , so no relaxation process takes place and dephasing is due to fluctuations of the energy difference of system , i.e. @xmath38 , eigenstates .",
    "hence the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the qubit in the @xmath38 basis ( populations ) are constant , whereas off - diagonal elements ( coherences ) decay . all the information on the reduced dynamics is included in the coherences .",

    "a sb environment with subohmic ( superohmic ) spectral densities  @xcite could be treated along the same lines , but since the uncoupled sb dynamics is always slow ( fast ) we do not expect tunable crossover lines to appear .",
    "our analysis can be easily extended to an environment made of an arbitrary number of sb impurities . in this case @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the individual contribution of the @xmath224th sb impurity .",
    "this allows to model a simple environment which produces @xmath2 noise by choosing a suitable distribution  @xcite of the parameters of the set sb impurities .",
    "for instance in ref .",
    "@xcite , which focuses on @xmath0 , the standard distribution @xmath225 has been chosen for the relaxation rate of the sb .",
    "we notice that for @xmath0 temperature has no effect in the regime we consider .",
    "if we allow for impurities with @xmath226 the temperature determines at most how many impurities in the set are active . instead for a @xmath2 environment modeled by a set of ohmic sb impurities with",
    "@xmath1 our results show a non trivial behavior as a function of the temperature , which may be relevant for recent observations  @xcite of temperature - dependent dephasing due to @xmath2 noise . finally if @xmath227 , @xmath38 is not conserved and relaxation occurs .",
    "the relaxation rate increases monotonically with @xmath228 .",
    "we believe that the physical picture emerging from this work still applies to dephasing ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 ) at least for times smaller than the relaxation time .",
