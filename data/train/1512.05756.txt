    "when cooper pairs are allowed to tunnel through permeable layers , the delocalization process of the pairs gives rise to a substantial enhancement of pairing @xcite . by allowing these systems to be finite in one or two dimensions ,",
    "it is interesting to explore how the thermodynamic and conduction properties are modified , for example due to the presence of surface states @xcite or through lattice disorder . in the case of a fermion gas ( electrons ) in a large periodic array , lattice disorder enhances localized states as was shown by anderson almost sixty year ago @xcite .",
    "also , localized states in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) have recently been observed in the context of bichromatic optical lattices obtained by superimposing two one - dimensional optical lattices with different wavelengths , or in waveguides in the presence of a controlled disorder created by laser speckle @xcite .",
    "disorder or random impurities have also been shown to produce bec in low - dimensional systems in the thermodynamic limit @xcite which would otherwise be impossible in an ordered lattice due to the hohenberg - mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the properties of a bose system within a disordered layer structure of finite extent and to understand how the possible formation of a bec can be enhanced by manipulating the positions of the layers .    in this work ,",

    "disorder is created when the reference , periodic - layered system goes to configurations with random barrier positions ( _ structural _ disorder ) , random barrier permeabilities ( _ compositional _ disorder ) , or by removing a fraction of the walls at arbitrary sites . in the case of wall vacancies , _ i.e. _ , when the periodicity is broken by the removal of a fraction of the walls , the effects on the thermodynamic properties of the gas are remarkable .    our starting scheme is the derivation of the dispersion relation for a system of @xmath4 bose particles in a layered sample where the layers or walls are represented by dirac - delta functions at fixed or at random distances . in section",

    "we start by removing walls in progressive positions .",
    "when one wall is removed , a level in each energy package of the ordered case jumps down thereby modifying the energy gap between the lowest level and the following one .",
    "this phenomenon produces an effective energy gap in the first set of energy levels whose magnitude depends on the position of the removed wall .",

    "the gap , @xmath79 and @xmath80 increases as the position of the removed layer varies from site 1 ( near the edge ) to site 5 .",
    "we claim that the increase in @xmath79 and @xmath80 is caused by the appearance of this gap since for a 3d infinite ideal bose gas with a quadratic dispersion relation plus a gap , both the bec critical temperature and specific heat height at its critical temperature increase as a function of the gap magnitude @xcite .",
    "since our system is semi - infinite the specific heat is unable to develop a sharp peak which is a signature of a phase transition .",

    "the removal of additional walls has a comparable effect in the energy levels .",

    "figure [ fig : n10several ] shows the effects of additional vacancies in the system .",
    "the specific heat in the ordered system has two maxima as a function of temperature .",
    "the maximum at the lower temperature is a signature of a bec transition for a bose gas confined in an infinite layered structure that would be present in the infinite system which appears at a critical temperature lower than @xmath82 as discussed in ref .",

    "lattice disorder is known to produce localization in fermi and , more recently , in bose systems in the thermodynamic limit . in this work ,",
    "we have studied the effects of lattice disorder in the specific heat of finite , bose systems by introducing random variations in the positions and/or strengths of the planes .",
    "the overall effect of these variations is to modify the position , as a function of the temperature , of the maximum of the specific heat to higher temperatures .",
    "its magnitude also increases when a large number of random samples is considered .",
    "however , when disorder is caused by the suppression of a random number of planes in the @xmath19direction a dramatic effect is observed . in the case of a small sample with @xmath74 walls , the lower temperature maximum of the specific heat increases by a large amount and",
    "it occurs at larger temperatures compared to the ordered and the free bose gas cases .",
    "in addition , the maximum at higher temperatures disappears . as more walls are removed , the magnitude of the first maximum decreases .",
    "the case of a larger sample ( @xmath81 ) reveals a similar behavior albeit in a more dramatic way .",
    "vacancies were introduced in symmetric or random configurations . in both cases ,",
    "the removal of about 20 walls increased the magnitude of the maximum of @xmath76 by twice the value in the ordered system and it appeared at higher temperatures .",
    "this behavior indicates that the large increase in the magnitude of the specific heat maximum is caused by the appearance of a gap in the energy spectrum .",
    "it also suggests that a critical number of plane vacancies promotes the emergence of a condensate phase at a temperature above the ibg critical temperature ."
