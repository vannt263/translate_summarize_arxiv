    "though quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is believed to be the underlying theory of the strong interactions , low energy phenomena such as static properties of hadrons defy solutions based on qcd because of formidable mathematical complexities .",
    "the pertinacity of qcd in the low energy regime have led to a great deal of efforts to construct an effective theory for the strong interactions . in pursuit of this aim , the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath0qsm ) ,",
    "also known as the semibosonized nambu - jona - lasinio model , emerged as a simple and successful effective theory to describe the low energy phenomena without loss of important properties of qcd such as chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking .",
    "originally , the idea of finding the soliton in a model with quarks coupled to pions was realized by kahana , ripka and soni  @xcite and birse and banerjee  @xcite .",
    "the bound states of the valence quarks were well explored in the model while it suffered from the vacuum instability .",
    "having studied the qcd instanton vacuum in the low - momenta limit , diakonov and petrov obtained an effective lagrangian resembled the nambu - jona - lasinio type model  @xcite with @xmath1-quark vertices .",
    "they showed that the resulting bosonized low - momenta theory is equivalent to the @xmath0qsm free from the vacuum instability .",
    "in fact , the effective model by diakonov and petrov has several important virtues : the mechanism of the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry is well explained in a natural way .",
    "it provides also a renormalization scale by the inverse of the average size of the instanton @xmath2 mev .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0qsm throws a bridge between the nonrelativistic constituent quark model and the skyrme model .",
    "the baryon in this model is regarded as @xmath3 valence quarks coupled to the polarized dirac sea bound by a nontrivial chiral field configuration in the hartree approximation  @xcite .",
    "the identification of the soliton as the baryon is acquired by the semiclassical collective quantization  @xcite which is performed by integrating over zero - mode fluctuations of the pion field around the saddle point .",
    "the model enables us to describe quantitatively a great deal of static properties of the nucleon such as baryon octet - decuplet mass splittings  @xcite , magnetic moments  @xcite , axial constants  @xcite , electromagnetic form factors  @xcite and so on ( see for example a recent review  @xcite ) .",
    "let me first sketch the @xmath0qsm . because one can find the detailed formalism elsewhere , i want to present the general idea of the model briefly .",
    "the @xmath0qsm in su(3 ) is characterized by a low - energy partition function in euclidean space given by the functional integral over pseudoscalar meson and quark fields : @xmath4 where @xmath5 stands for the dirac differential operator @xmath6 with the pseudoscalar chiral field @xmath7 the @xmath8 denotes the matrix element of the current quark mass given by @xmath9 @xmath10 represents the usual gell - mann matrices normalized as @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 designates the dynamical quark mass arising from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , which is in general momentum - dependent @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we shall regard @xmath12 as a constant and introduce the ultraviolet cutoff via the proper time regularization .",
    "the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively defined by @xmath16 we assume isospin symmetry , _ i.e. _ @xmath14 is taken to be zero .",
    "the operator @xmath5 is expressed in euclidean space in terms of the euclidean time derivative @xmath17 and the dirac one - particle hamiltonian @xmath18 @xmath19 with @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the well - known dirac hermitian matrices .",
    "the @xmath23 is defined by @xmath24 , which is introduced to avoid certain divergences in some observables such as the isovector electric charge radius in the chiral limit ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "note that the effective chiral action given by eq.([eq : z ] ) contains the wess ",
    "zumino and four - derivative gasser  leutwyler terms with correct coefficients in the gradient expansion .",
    "therefore , at least the first four terms in the gradient expansion of eq.([eq : z ] ) are correctly reproduced and chiral symmetry arguments do not leave much room for further modifications .    in order to calculate an observable in the @xmath0qsm , we consider a correlation function : @xmath26 at large euclidean time @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 stands for the corresponding spin operator , while @xmath29 is the corresponding flavor operator .",
    "the @xmath30 denotes the nucleon current consisting of @xmath3 quark fields .",
    "the corresponding matrix element can be represented by the euclidean functional integral : @xmath31}. \\label{eq : ev } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the quark fields being integrated out , eq.([eq : ev ] ) can be divided into two separate contributions : @xmath32 schematically , the valence and sea contributions are shown in fig.1 .    the integral over chiral bosonic fields @xmath33 can be carried out by the saddle point method in the large @xmath3 limit with the following ansatz : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the su(2 ) chiral background field @xmath36 } .",
    "\\label{eq : profile}\\ ] ] @xmath37 denotes the profile function satisfying the boundary condition @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "since the angular velocity @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) and the strange quark mass @xmath42 are regarded as small parameters in our model , we expand the propagator @xmath43 with respect to the @xmath40 and @xmath42 up to the first order : @xmath44 figure 2 shows the rotational @xmath45 corrections and @xmath42 ones diagrammatically .",
    "the rotational @xmath45 corrections are of particular importance in the present model .",
    "the time - ordering of collective operators has to be taken into account in the quantization , since they do not not commute in principle .",
    "the rotational @xmath45 corrections made it possible to solve the long - standing problem of underestimation of axial charges and magnetic moments in the @xmath0qsm  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there have been arguments that the rotational @xmath45 corrections violate charge conjugation  @xcite",
    ". however , christov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and wakamatsu  @xcite proved that the rotational @xmath45 corrections possess correct properties under charge conjugation .",
    "moreover , it was shown by praszaowicz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that with the rotational @xmath45 corrections considered the @xmath0qsm reproduces the result of the axial charge in the nonrelativistic quark model , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46 , while it gives @xmath47 without them .",
    "the collective su(3 ) hamiltonian is no longer su(3 ) symmetric when the @xmath42 corrections are taken into account .",
    "hence , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are neither in a pure octet nor in a pure decuplet but in mixed state with higher representations . dealing with the @xmath42 as a perturbation",
    ", we can obtain the mixed su(3 ) baryon states : @xmath48 the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be found elsewhere ( see for example the recent review  @xcite ) .",
    "i want to remark the parameters of the model for the numerical calculation , before i start to discuss the results .",
    "the present su(3 ) @xmath0qsm contains four free parameters .",
    "two of them are fixed in the meson sector by adjusting them to the pion mass , @xmath51 , the pion decay constant , @xmath52 , and the kaon mass , @xmath53 . as for the fourth parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ the constituent mass @xmath12 of up and down quarks , values around @xmath54 have been used because they have turned out to be the most appropriate one for the description of nucleon mass splittings and other observables of baryons ( see ref .",
    "hence , we fix the parameter @xmath12 to 420 mev . for the description of the baryon sector , the method of ref.@xcite",
    "is chosen , modified for a finite meson mass .",
    "the resulting strange current quark mass comes out around @xmath55 . with this set of fixed parameters ,",
    "all the results which will be presented from now on have been calculated .",
    "setting @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we can calculate the electromagnetic form factors  @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows the electric form factors of the nucleon . in the case of the proton",
    ", the result agrees well with the empirical data  @xcite . as for the neutron , the result seems to be smaller than the empirical data by platchkov  @xcite .",
    "however , compared to the recent experiment conducted in mainz  @xcite , the su(3 ) result is in good agreement with it .",
    "the electric charge radii of the proton and the neutron are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding experimental data are @xmath60 and @xmath61  @xcite .    in dotted curves in fig .",
    "1 , the prediction of the su(2 ) model is shown .",
    "as for the electric form factor of the proton , it is comparable to the su(2 ) , whereas a great discrepancy is observed in the case of that of the neutron .",
    "it is partly because of the absence of @xmath42 and terms appearing only in su(3 ) and partly because of the different expectation values of the collective operators .",
    "figure 4 displays the magnetic form factors of the nucleon . as we can see , the momentum dependence of the magnetic form factors are well reproduced , compared to the empirical data .",
    "the @xmath42 corrections enhance the magnetic form factors about @xmath62 in the case of the neutron , which is not negligible to improve the prediction .",
    "the magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron are , respectively , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , while experimental data are @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the magnetic charge radii of the proton and the neutron are obtained as follows : @xmath67 @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding experimental data are @xmath70 @xmath68 and @xmath71 @xmath68 . on the whole",
    ", they are in remarkable agreement with the experimental data within around @xmath72 .    in fact , one can show that any model with _ hedgehog _",
    "symmetry can not reproduce the experimental data of baryonic magnetic moments better than the error of @xmath73 @xcite . in that sense",
    ", the @xmath0qsm lies in the upper limit of accuracy which can be attained in any hedgehog model in the case of the magnetic properties .",
    "it is of great interest to study the scalar form factor of the nucleon @xcite , since it provides also a clue of strangeness in the nucleon .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath74 term the momentum dependence of the scalar form factor was carried out by gasser , leutwyler and sainio  @xcite .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are summarized as @xmath75 mev and @xmath76 mev , and @xmath77 which means a share of @xmath78 in the @xmath74 term .",
    "the results indicate that the strangeness content of the nucleon in the scalar channel is not negligible , while a couple of recent theoretical works insist that there is no need to introduce a portion of strange quarks to explain the @xmath79 term  @xcite . however , though it might be small , it is still important to consider the contribution of the strange quarks to the @xmath79 term in accordance with the recent experimental indication that strange quarks might play an important role of explaining the properties of the nucleon .",
    "figure 5 draws the scalar form factor of the nucleon .",
    "the error bar presented in fig.5 stands for the empirical analysis due to gasser , leutwyler and sainio .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "5 our theoretical prediction is in good agreement with ref .",
    "the @xmath42 corrections seem to be negligible in the scalar form factor . however , they play an important role of suppressing the strangeness contribution : the value of @xmath80 with the @xmath42 corrections is 0.27 while @xmath81 without the @xmath42 corrections .",
    "it implies that though the @xmath42 corrections have a tiny effect on the magnitude of the scalar form factor , it leads to a large suppression of the @xmath80.the difference @xmath82 we have obtained is @xmath83 mev .",
    "this value is very close to what ref.@xcite extracted , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath84 mev .",
    "the prediction of the @xmath0qsm for the scalar radius @xmath85 is @xmath86 which is also comparable to the empirical value obtained by ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath87 .",
    "the strangeness content of the nucleon in the vector channel is one of hot issues these days .",
    "while a great deal of theoretical works pile up , there is no clear theoretical consensus and no evident experimental judgment yet .    encouraged by successful results of the scalar , electromagnetic and axial properties in the su(3 ) @xmath0qsm , it is of great interest to investigate the strange vector form factors in the same framework @xcite .",
    "however , before we pursue the study of the strange vector form factors , we need to take into account the kaonic effect properly in line with the recent theoretical calculations incorporating the kaonic loops  @xcite . from this theoretical point of view",
    ", the strangeness in the nucleon can be interpreted in terms of the @xmath88 or @xmath89 components .",
    "figure 6 displays a schematic diagram of explaining how the strangeness arises in the nucleon .",
    "the diagram shown in the left - hand side of fig .",
    "6 can be redrawn in terms of quarks .",
    "in fact , the nucleon is known to consist of three valence quarks , _ i.e. _ @xmath90 . when one of the @xmath91 quarks is hit by the external strange vector current as shown in fig .",
    "6 , the @xmath92 pair is created and rearranged so that we may have quark compositions @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "they correspond respectively to @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this explains that we have the contribution from the valence part as well as the sea part to the strange vector form factors , though the nucleon itself does not include any strange valence quark .",
    "as is explained above , kaons play a dominant role in describing the strange vector form factors .",
    "the @xmath0qsm discussed up to now does not include the kaon cloud which is believed to be of little importance in the former calculation except for the neutron electric form factor @xcite .",
    "however , to treat the strange vector form factors , we have to take the effect of the kaon cloud into account properly . to do so",
    ", we have incorporated the kaonic tails selfconsistently in the profile @xmath37 in eq.([eq : profile ] ) at the expense of the pion tails .",
    "figure 7 shows the strange vector form factors .",
    "the effect of the kaon cloud is in particular prominent in the case of the strange electric form factor . as shown in fig .",
    "7 , the replacement of the pion cloud by the kaon one brings about a sizable decrease of the strange electric form factor almost by a factor of three .",
    "this remarkable result is in line with the recent investigation of the kaonic effects on the neutron electric form factor  @xcite .",
    "such a drastic reduction of the strange electric form factor can be easily understood explicitly by evaluating the strange electric radii . in any hedgehog model",
    "the strange radii depend on the inverse of the meson mass @xmath97 which suppresses the tail of the profile , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath98 . from such a behavior of the @xmath99",
    ", we can derive the relation @xmath100 eq.([eq : radius ] ) explains the decrease of the @xmath101 with @xmath102 .    though the strange magnetic form factor is not changed as much as the strange electric one , the effect of the kaon cloud is still noticeable .",
    "in contrast to the strange electric form factor , the kaon cloud enhances the magnitude of the strange magnetic one almost @xmath103 . as a result , by replacing the pion cloud by the kaon one , the strange magnetic moment @xmath104 is brought from @xmath105 @xmath106 to @xmath107 @xmath106 .",
    "in addition , i want to mention a preliminary experimental result of the strange magnetic moment announced by mckeown  @xcite in this workshop .",
    "surprisingly , his finding is _",
    "positive_. it implies that it conflicts with almost all of the theoretical models including the present model .",
    "if the experimental result turns out to be correct , the present simple picture will not be enough to describe the strange vector form factors .",
    "a more sophisticated and higher order corrections should be considered .",
    "however , we still anticipate more compiled experimental data to enlighten us on it .",
    "finally , i want shortly to present a recent calculation of the tensor charges of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the tensor charge @xmath108 is related to the transverse quark distribution @xmath109 .",
    "however , @xmath110 is not measurable in inclusive deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "that is the reason why it has not been extensively studied for long .",
    "in fact , ralston and soper  @xcite proposed the @xmath110 which can be measured in polarized drell - yan processes almost 20 years ago .",
    "recently , it was also suggested that the @xmath110 can be measured in other exclusive hard reactions  @xcite .",
    "jaffe and ji demonstrated that the first moment of the @xmath110 is related to the tensor charge of the nucleon : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is an antiquark transversity distribution .",
    "setting @xmath113 and @xmath114 in eq.([eq : corr ] ) , we can evaluate the tensor charges @xmath115 in the @xmath0qsm , which are linearly related to @xmath108 .",
    "note that the tensor charges depend on the renormalization scale , though their dependence on it is very weak .",
    "the normalization point pertinent to the @xmath0qsm is not determined from the first principle . however , as mentioned in section i , the renormalization point in the @xmath0qsm has be chosen by @xmath116 mev , but there may be a factor of order unity .",
    "in tables i - ii the results of the tensor charges are summarized . as shown in table i the rotational @xmath45 corrections are of great significance numerically , while the @xmath42 corrections are relatively small .",
    "in contrast to the axial charges , the tensor ones in the @xmath0qsm are closer to their values in the nonrelativistic constituent quark model and in particular the strangeness contribution to the tensor charge @xmath117 is compatible with zero , while that to the axial ones @xmath118 in the @xmath0qsm is negative and distinctive from zero  @xcite .",
    "this difference between the tensor charges and the axial ones can be explained by calculating them in the gradient expansion and scrutinizing their dependence on the size of the soliton @xcite .",
    "my aim in this talk has been to review the recent investigation on various form factors of the nucleon in the su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model(@xmath0qsm ) .",
    "the rotational @xmath45 and linear @xmath42 corrections were taken into account .",
    "the only parameter we have in the model is the constituent quark mass @xmath12 which is fixed to 420 mev by the mass splitting of the su(3 ) baryon octet and decuplet .",
    "the results for the electromagnetic and scalar form factors are in remarkable agreement with experimental and empirical data within about 15 @xmath119 .",
    "the strange vector form factors were also discussed .",
    "the effect of kaon cloud turns out to be very large . by taking into account this kaonic effect ,",
    "the strange charge radius is reduced to be almost 3 times smaller than that without the kaon cloud , while the magnitude of the strange magnetic moment is increased .",
    "the tensor charges of the nucleon are presented in the same framework .",
    "the @xmath0qsm predicts the number of the transversely polarized strange quarks @xmath117 in the transversely polarized nucleon compatible with zero , whereas it yields the negative nonzero number of the polarized strange quarks @xmath118 in the longitudinally polarized nucleon , which is consistent with the corresponding experimental value .",
