    "the familiar example of vitrification upon super - cooling molecular fluids provides proof that an effectively non - ergodic disordered state can be generated in a system without pre - existing quenched disorder .",
    "such self - generated glassiness may be a more widespread possibility in the material world than is currently acknowledged .",
    "candidate solid state systems with extremely slow dynamics often have impurities remaining from their synthesis so there is always a suspicion that non - ergodicity comes from disorder.mang01,millis96,dagotto,nmr01,nmr02,nmr03,nmr3b,nmr04,msr01,msr02,msr03 while a rather successful microscopic theory of molecular glasses now exists based on the idea of an underlying random first order transition@xcite , this theory , like all theories of liquid state phenomena , contains approximations that can only be checked _ a posteriori _ through their agreement with simulations or experiments . to deepen and widen our understanding of glassy dynamics beyond the molecular fluid example , it would be desirable to have a model which can be analyzed in a formally exact fashion using familiar tools of continuum field theory . such a theory would also help clarifying which features of the current theory of structural glasses are robust and `` protected''@xcite and which are fortuitously correct .    both , the recent treatment of the thermodynamics of fragile glasses developed within a replica formulation@xcite and the closely related approach using density functional theory for super - cooled liquids@xcite suggest that the major aspects of glass formation  stem from the very strong local correlations of a dense super - cooled fluid .",
    "this is very different  from systems with critical dynamics close to second order phase transitions , where long wavelength fluctuations are paramount .",
    "one finds experimentally that dynamics on essentially all wavelengths slows to nearly the same extent as the glass transition is approached .",
    "this suggests that the search for an solvable limit of the glass problem should focus on the strong but local nonlinearities .",
    "major progress has recently been made in the theoretical understanding of strongly interacting systems with predominantly local correlations .",
    "strongly correlated electron systems like mott insulators or systems with strong electron - phonon interactions have been investigated with the dynamic mean field theory@xcite ( dmft ) .",
    "originally , this approach was based on the assumption that all non - trivial correlations of a given system are strictly local ( for the precise definition of a local theory , see below ) and then allowed for a solution of such systems without further approximations .",
    "more recently several generalizations of the approach have been developed , which allow the inclusion of collective excitationssi , ck90 as well as short range correlations in so called cluster dmft theories@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will follow the main strategy of the dynamic mean field approach and apply it to the replica theory of self generated glassiness .",
    "this allows us to solve completely for the long time correlation function ( edwards - anderson parameter ) as well as the configurational entropy of a glass within a local theory . even though the origin of glassiness is not quenched disorder",
    ", there is a similarity between our theory and the mean field theory of spin glasses which is also exact in the limit of a purely local approach .",
    "solvable local limits like the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , turned out to be extremely fruitful for the investigation of more realistic models . to identify and solve",
    "such a local problem is therefore of general interest .",
    "another appealing aspect of the approach developed here is that the recent generalizations of the dmft to cluster systems offer a feasible way to develop a controlled series of approximations for candidate glassy systems that successively extend the range of local correlations taken into account.@xcite .",
    "clearly , before this becomes possible we have to set up and analyze the strictly local ( i.e. mean field ) theory . the solutions of the local field theories discussed in this paper rely on a self consistency condition that is uniformly applied to the replicated statistical mechanics problem . the droplet effects that give rise to the activated transitions in molecular fluids can not be described by this uniform replica symmetry breaking ansatz .",
    "while the self consistent replica field theory is applicable to account for some geometric effects in finite dimensions the latter highly nonperturbative effects are absent , but are suppressed if the coordination number is high .",
    "we should also mention that related interesting approach to self - generated glassiness in a model in infinite dimensions ( where the locality of the problem is exactly guaranteed ) that was recently presented by lopatin and ioffe.@xcite    we demonstrate that a uniformly frustrated system with competition of interactions on different length scales undergoes a glass transition once inhomogeneous fluctuations become strong enough if no ordered phase forms via nucleation .",
    "specific calculations are carried out for the case of the brazovskii model@xcite , which describes systems with tendency towards micro - phase separation .",
    "glassiness was shown to exist in this model in refs .. however , it remained unclear to what extent this is merely a consequence of an approximate solution using perturbation theory or is indeed the correct mean field behavior of this model .",
    "in the next section we briefly summarize the replica approach to self generated glassiness , present the main idea of the dynamic mean field theory and solve the local theory for self generated glassiness in case of the brazovskii model .",
    "we  summarize the results of this paper in section iii .",
    "in this paper we consider physical systems consisting of @xmath0-components ( types of atoms or molecules ) and with short ranged @xmath1 , @xmath2 and higher  order virial coefficients .",
    "no specific assumption is made with respect to the ( possibly non local )  @xmath3 virial coefficient .  in terms of a density field @xmath4 of particles of type @xmath5 ( @xmath6 in case of a one component system ) we then have an effective energy : @xmath7 = h_{0}\\left [ \\phi \\right ] + \\int d^{d}xv\\left ( \\phi _ { l}\\left ( \\mathbf{x}\\right ) \\right )    \\label{hamgen}\\ ] ]    with @xmath8where @xmath9 is the deviation of the density from its average value .",
    "the key assumption made in eqs.[hamgen ] and [ hamgen2 ] is the local character of @xmath10 which includes the higher order virial coefficients .",
    "for example , eq.[hamgen ] , might be a representation of the density functional used by ramakrishnan and youssoff with @xmath11 the direct correlation function of the fluid@xcite and @xmath12\\]]the ideal gas free energy .",

    "the knowledge of the equilibrium partition function is not sufficient anymore .",
    "a widely accepted view@xcite is that a glassy system may be considered to be trapped in local metastable states for very long time and can therefore not realize a considerable part of the entropy of the system ,  called the configurational entropy @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of metastable states .",
    "if @xmath15 is exponentially large with respect to the size of the system , @xmath16 becomes extensive and ordinary equilibrium thermodynamics fails .",
    "there are several theoretical approaches which offer a solution to this breakdown of equilibrium many body theory . on the one hand one can solve for the time evolution of correlation and response functions , an approach which explicitly reflects the dynamic character of the glassy state .",
    "mostly because of its technical simplicity , an alternative ( but equivalent ) approach is based on a replica theorymon95,mp991 .",
    "even though this approach does not allow one to calculate the complete time evolution , long time correlations as well as stationary response functions can be determined which are in agreement with the explicit dynamic theory .",
    "we will use the replica approach because of its relative simplicity .",

    "one can interpret @xmath18 as the result of a quenched average over random field configurations with infinitesimal disorder strength @xmath21 and a distribution function which is determined by the partition function of the system itself .",
    "a similar approach ( however for finite @xmath21 ) was proposed by deam and edwards@xcite in the theory of the vulcanization transition where the distribution of random cross - links of a polymer melt is also determined by the actual partition function of the polymer system itselfpaul .",
    "then , just as in the present approach , the number of replicas , @xmath22 , is taken to the limit @xmath19 , as opposed to the usual @xmath23 limit used for systems with averaging over `` white '' quenched disorder distributions . in the vulcanization problem , @xmath21 is related to the cross link density and , in distinction to the theory presented here , remains finite .",
    "physically , the analysis of @xmath24 addresses whether the system drives itself  ( @xmath19 ) into a glassy state if exposed to an infinitesimally weak randomness ( @xmath20 )",

    "this is a very hard problem without known exact solution and we are forced to use computer simulations or  to  develop approximate analytical theories .",
    "in developing such an approximate theory we take advantage of the fact that glass forming systems are often driven by strong local correlations , as opposed to the pronounced long ranged correlations at a second order phase transition or the critical point of the liquid - vapor coexistence curve .",
    "this is transparent both , in the mode coupling theory of under - cooled liquids@xcite and in the self - consistent phonon approaches@xcite , where a given molecule is locally caged by its environment built of other molecules .     when we call a physical system _",

    "we use the freedom to chose @xmath70 in order to guarantee that @xmath71 .",
    "this implies that not only the functional @xmath57 but also its argument are the same for the actual physical system and the auxiliary local one .",
    "it then follows that the self energy of  the original system @xmath50 is , up to a trivial prefactor which results from the above discretization , equal to the self energy of the auxiliary system , @xmath72 .",
