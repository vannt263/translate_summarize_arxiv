    "the resulting lagrangian contains no 4-point vertices@xmath33 therefore , if we restrict ourselves to the so - called double - bubble approximation where the self - energy of the particles is independent of momentum , the contribution of @xmath34  to the cjt effective potential vanishes .",

    "although qualitatively similar to the standard double - bubble approximation in the treatment without auxiliary field , the gap equations are quantitatively different and lead to different results for the order parameter and the masses of the particles as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "a natural next step is to include sunset - type diagrams in the 2pi effective action , which lead to nonzero imaginary parts for the self - energy of the quasiparticles and , in turn , to a nonzero decay width .",
