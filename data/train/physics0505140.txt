    "with the advent of short - pulse laser systems yielding multi - terawatt power , laser - driven nuclear physics has emerged as a very active area of research @xcite with applications such as radioactive isotope production and nuclear transmutation of elements . in particular ,",
    "the emission of neutrons from fusion reactions has been observed in several experiments with different pulse parameters and target types , including solid targets @xcite , heavy water droplets @xcite , deuterium clusters @xcite , and underdense plasmas or gas jets @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the number of neutrons produced per joule of the laser pulse energy is usually in the @xmath2 range for terawatt , femtosecond lasers , and higher for large petawatt , picosecond lasers ( see table  i of ref.@xcite for a partial summary ) . while the large neutron fluxes produced by petawatt pulses are of importance for material damage studies relevant to thermonuclear fusion research @xcite , neutron bursts produced by `` table - top terawatt '' ( t@xmath3 ) lasers at high repetition rate may provide compact , pulsed neutron sources for radiography and other applications .",
    "the interpretation of the above experiments suggests that , as a general issue , the route to neutron production starts from the heating of target electrons up to high energies ; in turn , the electron currents produce space - charge fields driving ion acceleration up to mev energies ( via various mechanisms such as sheath acceleration in solid targets , or coulomb explosion in clusters and underdense plasma channels ) ; finally , collisions between ions lead to fusion reactions and neutron emission",
    ". the duration of the latter could not be measured so far in experiments ; however , based on the physical picture which is inferred from the experiments , we expect the neutron pulse duration not to be shorter than the laser pulse duration , i.e. , to be typically in the @xmath4 range .    in this paper , we study a new approach to neutron production by ultrashort laser pulses , which could provide a source of fusion neutrons with sub - optical cycle duration .",
    "this represents another possible route to the ultrafast control and imaging of nuclear reactions by superintense fields @xcite and may be used to study phenomena such as nuclear spin - mixing oscillations whose period was estimated to be @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on the prediction that the irradiation of a solid targets with circularly polarized , intense short pulses leads to the prompt acceleration of high - density , short duration ion bunches @xcite .",
    "such bunches may be used efficiently as projectiles for beam fusion , since for deuterium the energy in the center - of - mass system may approach the gamow value ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the reduced mass ) for which the cross sections of deuterium - deuterium ( d - d ) or deuterium - tritium ( d - t ) reactions have a maximum . with an appropriate target scheme , fusion reactions and related neutron emission may last just for a time of the order of the ion bunch duration , which may be less than one optical cycle .",
    "to find a scheme based on the @xmath8 reaction aiming at the shortest achievable duration , we consider a symmetrical , double - sided irradiation of a thin foil target . in this scheme ,",
    "two colliding ion bunches are generated .",
    "thus , if the two bunches are properly timed , for a given value of the laser intensity the energy in the center - of - mass is maximized while the duration of neutron emission is minimized .",
    "this experimental geometry is similar to the one of ref.@xcite , where a `` laser - confined '' thermonuclear fusion approach was proposed . in that scheme ,",
    "a thin deuterium - tritium foil is compressed , heated and confined by double - side irradiation using relatively long pulses . in our scheme , to produce two single bunches the laser pulse duration must be much shorter ( a few cycles ) than in ref.@xcite .",
    "our approach is based on a non - thermal _ beam fusion _",
    "concept with emphasis on the ultrashort duration of the neutron emission , and without concerns of target stability .",
    "we now discuss the target and pulse requirements based on the features of ion bunch generation studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "the bunch ion velocity spectrum extends up to a maximum velocity @xmath9 , given by @xmath10 @xmath11 is the initial electron density , @xmath12 is the cut - off density for the laser frequency @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the dimensionless laser amplitude , being @xmath15 and @xmath16 the intensity and the wavelength of the laser pulse , respectively . at a given value of @xmath17 , the lower @xmath11 the higher @xmath9 .",
    "collisions in the center - of - mass system at the gamow energy for the d - d reaction will begin when @xmath18 .",
    "the ion bunch acceleration occurs over a typical time @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the duration of a laser cycle .",
    "thus , ultraintense few - cycle pulses , which are now at the frontier of current research @xcite , are best suited for ion bunch acceleration .",
    "the number of accelerated ions per unit surface is @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the background ion density and @xmath23 is the evanescence length of the ponderomotive force inside the plasma . at the end of the acceleration stage ( @xmath24 ) , a sharp peak of the ion density",
    "is formed at a distance @xmath25 from the original target surface ; the peak density is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is found from simulations , and the bunch width is thus @xmath28 .",
    "one expects @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the plasma frequency .",
    "thus , @xmath31 holds when @xmath32 , and the bunch duration @xmath33 and can be less than @xmath34 .    in the colliding bunches",
    "scheme the duration of the neutron burst , will be of the order of @xmath35 , i.e. in the sub - femtosecond regime .",
    "the optimal target thickness is close to the value @xmath36 , in order to let the two bunches collide at the end of the acceleration stage . since a very thin foil target",
    "is needed , deuterated plastic , e.g. @xmath37 , looks more suitable than pure ( cryogenic ) deuterium as a target material ; however , the much higher value of @xmath11 requires higher pulse intensities . in the following , both pure solid d (",
    "@xmath38 i.e. @xmath39 for @xmath40 ) and `` plastic '' targets ( with same @xmath41 but @xmath42 ) are discussed .",
    "we now analyze the double - sided irradiation of a thin foil using a particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite a one - dimensional ( 1d ) model is adequate to keep the essential features of ion bunch generation .",
    "this allows us to use a very fine spatial and temporal resolution , which is actually necessary to resolve the bunch formation properly , since the latter is characterized by sharp density gradients and very short formation times . in our simulations",
    "we use 2000 grid cells per wavelength and 2000 particles per cell at the initial time .",
    "in addition , to compute the neutron yield from the simulation data ( as shown below ) properly , the ion distribution function has to be reconstructed over a phase space grid once every a few timesteps .",
    "figure  [ fig : pic ] shows results for a `` d '' foil simulation .",
    "the front and rear laser pulses both have peak amplitude @xmath43 and duration @xmath44 ( fwhm ) , corresponding to an intensity of @xmath45 , and a duration of @xmath46 if @xmath40 .",
    "the foil target has initial density @xmath47 and thickness @xmath48 .",
    "the ion density reaches a peak value close to @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 , with rise and fall times of @xmath51 .",
    "the maximum ion velocity @xmath52 .",
    "the results of a `` cd@xmath53 '' simulation ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and all the other parameters equal to the case of fig.[fig : pic ] ) are qualitatively similar : @xmath57 and @xmath58 are found .",
    "we now compute the neutron burst intensity and duration from the simulation data .",
    "the reactivity for a fusion reaction @xcite is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the cross section and the distribution function ( normalized to unity ) , respectively , in terms of the relative velocity @xmath62 , being @xmath63 the velocities of the two ion species .",
    "the number of fusion reactions per unit volume and time is given by @xmath64 @xcite , being @xmath65 the number densities of the two ion species .",
    "for ions of the same species , as in the d ",
    "d reaction , @xmath66 .",
    "a convenient parameterization of the cross section is given by @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the center - of - mass energy , and @xmath69 is the astrophysical factor that is a slowly varying function of @xmath70 and hence will be taken as a constant @xmath71 for d - d .    from the pic simulation data we obtain @xmath61 at any grid point by computing the ion velocity distribution @xmath72 on a phase space grid , from which @xmath61 is obtained by convolution .",
    "we thus compute the reactivity and , from the knowledge of the ion density , the number of fusion reactions per unit density and time at each grid point .",
    "finally , we obtain the total rate of fusion events and the overall number of neutrons produced by integrating @xmath73 over space .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : burst ] for both the `` d '' and `` cd@xmath53 '' target cases . the same number density of deuterium ions has been assumed . in both cases ,",
    "a neutron burst is generated with a duration of about @xmath74 ( fwhm ) and a yield of @xmath75 .",
    "since the pulse duration is @xmath76 , the number of neutrons produced per joule of the pulse energy is @xmath77 for the d case with @xmath43 , @xmath77 cd@xmath53 case ( @xmath55 ) ; these numbers are roughly between one and two orders of magnitude lower than that inferred from experiments with t@xmath3 systems ; however , for the present scheme the expected duration is likely to be much shorter , and the emission rate may be comparable or even higher .",
    "the relatively long - lasting tail in the fusion rate is due to the fact that the two bunches , after crossing each other , propagate in a low - density shelf of ions which originate from the layer of charge depletion at the surface and have been accelerated to lower energies than the bunch ions ( see fig.[fig : pic ] and ref.@xcite ) . at higher intensities the ions in the shelf",
    "have enough energy to sustain a significant rate of fusion reactions during the propagation of the bunch , leading to a higher total yield but also to a longer duration ( a few femtoseconds ) of the neutron emission .",
    "to check our numerical results , and to provide an approximate scaling of the neutron yield versus the laser intensity , we analytically evaluate the fusion rate in the colliding - bunches scheme . from ref.@xcite",
    "we infer that it is worth to consider for the ion bunch velocity distribution @xmath72 either a `` flat - top '' velocity distribution @xmath78 for @xmath79 and zero elsewhere , and a monochromatic distribution @xmath80 . in both cases",
    "the relative velocity distribution @xmath61 is easily obtained analytically by convolution .",
    "the averaged reactivity may thus be written as @xmath81 where @xmath82 , @xmath83\\ , , & ( f = f_f)\\ , , \\\\   ( \\zeta /2 ) e^{-\\zeta/2 } \\ , , & ( f = f_d)\\ , , \\end{array}\\right . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath84 is the exponential integral function of order @xmath85 .",
    "the rate of neutrons produced per unit volume is given by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 . to obtain the number @xmath88 of neutrons produced per unit surface we multiply @xmath73 by the spatial extension of the neutron burst , @xmath28 , and by the burst duration @xmath89 .",
    "hence , the total neutron yield does _ not _ depend on the compression ratio @xmath90 , which only affects the bunch width and the burst duration .",
    "we obtain @xmath91 the dependence of @xmath88 on the laser intensity is shown in fig.[fig : yield ] for both choices of @xmath92 .",
    "posing @xmath93 , we obtain @xmath94 for `` d '' , @xmath95 for `` cd@xmath53 '' targets .",
    "these values underestimate the neutron yield observed in simulations ; this is likely to be due to the fact that the effective screening length @xmath23 is actually larger than @xmath96 and/or the active volume for fusion reactions is wider than the bunch , since , as observed above , fusion reactions occur also in the low - density shelf . this explanation is also supported by noting that the burst duration is also underestimated when taking @xmath93 : for `` d '' targets , @xmath97 while a duration of @xmath98 is observed in fig.[fig : burst ] .",
    "using ultrashort ion bunches , it may be also possible to obtain a fetmosecond source of neutrons or other fusion products from heteronuclear reactions using a single short pulse impinging on a layered target .",
    "as an example we consider neutron production in a target with a thin surface layer of deuterium for ion acceleration and an inner tritium layer as an immobile target , using the @xmath99 reaction . in the relevant energy range",
    "; however , this low - energy range ( where @xmath100 varies strongly with energy ) is not considered here , since the laser - plasma interaction regime becomes very collisional and must be further investigated . ]",
    "the astrophysical factor for the d - t reaction is @xmath101 , almost 200 times larger than for d - d .",
    "this effect compensates the loss in the center - of - mass energy with respect to the colliding bunches scheme at the same laser intensity .",
    "if the deuterium layer has a thickness @xmath25 , and the tritium layer is not thicker than the ion bunch , the neutron burst duration might be limited to @xmath102 .",
    "an analytical estimate , analogous to that leading to eq.([eq : yield ] ) , leads to the following result @xmath103 where @xmath104 or @xmath105 for a flat - top or monochromatic ion distribution , respectively , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 has been assumed . if the tritium layer @xmath108 is thicker than @xmath109 , both the yield and the duration increase by a factor @xmath110 .",
    "the function @xmath111 has a maximum in the range of intensities @xmath112 .",
    "we briefly discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed scheme .",
    "the required laser pulse duration and intensity are within present - day , or at least near - term capabilities of table - top systems .",
    "quenching of prepulse , pulse synchronization and need of circular polarization as well as thin foil target manifacturing are likely to be demanding tasks but not out of reach .",
    "the measurement of the duration of a neutron burst with sub - femtosecond resolution is a challenging issue .",
    "we argue that it may be possible to perform an indirect measurement based on the interaction of the neutrons with a secondary target , where charged particles are produced ; this process may be resolved in time by using attosecond spectroscopy techniques @xcite .    in conclusion , we investigated the production of fusion neutrons using ion bunches accelerated in solid deuterated targets by circularly polarized laser pulses . our results , in connection with the continuous progress in producing ultrashort , superintense laser pulses at a high repetition rate , may open a perspective for a neutron source with sub - optical cycle duration and sufficient brightness for applications .",
