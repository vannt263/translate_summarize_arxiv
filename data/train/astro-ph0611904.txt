    "the unwavering obsession to which the title refers applies only to the first author since the other co - authors are still too young to be obsessed by such a thing as the mass distribution of white dwarf stars .    as early as 1976",
    ", it was suggested that below @xmath0  k , convective mixing between the thin superficial hydrogen layer and the more massive underlying helium layer could turn a hydrogen - rich star into a helium - rich star , provided the mass of the hydrogen layer is small enough ( a modern value yields @xmath1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the effective temperature at which this mixing occurs is a function of the mass of the hydrogen layer : for thicker hydrogen layers , the mixing occurs at lower effective temperatures .",
    "since the process of convective mixing is still poorly understood , the exact ratio of helium to hydrogen after the mixing occurs remains unknown .",
    "in particular , it is possible that instead of turning a da star into a featureless helium - rich dc star , convective mixing may simply enrich the hydrogen - rich atmosphere with large quantities of helium , leading to a mixed hydrogen and helium atmospheric composition .",
    "such a hypothesis is difficult to test , however , since helium becomes spectroscopically invisible below @xmath2  k , and its presence can only be inferred through indirect methods .    such a method has been proposed by @xcite who showed that the atmospheric helium abundance could be determined from a detailed examination of the high balmer lines , since the presence of helium increases the photospheric pressure , and thus produces a quenching of the upper levels of the hydrogen atom which , in turn , affects the line profiles .",
    "this method has been put forward on a more quantitative basis by @xcite who analyzed 37 cool da stars using the spectroscopic method of fitting high balmer line spectroscopy with the predictions of detailed model atmospheres with mixed hydrogen and helium compositions .",
    "their analysis first showed that the effects produced on the hydrogen lines at high @xmath3 could not be distinguished from those produced by the presence of large amounts of helium .",
    "hence , the problem could only be approached from a statistical point of view by assuming a mean value of @xmath4 for all stars , and then by determining individual helium abundances . under this assumption , the analysis of bergeron et al",
    ".  revealed that the atmospheres of most objects below @xmath5  k were contaminated by significant amounts of helium , with abundances sometimes as high as @xmath6 .",
    "we show in figure 1 an update of this result using a sample of 232 da stars analyzed with our most recent grid of model atmospheres . on the left panel",
    "we show the surface gravity as a function of effective temperature for each object .",
    "clearly , the values determined here are significantly higher than the canonical value of @xmath4 for da stars ( shown by the dashed line ) ; the mean surface gravity of this sample is actually @xmath7 .",
    "if we assume instead that our sample is representative of other da stars and adopt @xmath4 for each object , we can determine individual helium abundances .",
    "this is shown on the right panel of figure 1 . as can be seen",
    ", non - negligible amounts of helium in the range @xmath8 at the surface of these da stars can easily account for the high @xmath3 values inferred under the assumption of pure hydrogen compositions .",
    "( right panel).,height=245 ]",
    "the results discussed above rest heavily on the abililty of the models to describe accurately the physical conditions encountered in cool white dwarf atmospheres , but also on the reliability of the spectroscopic method to yield accurate measurements of the atmospheric parameters .",
    "it is with this idea in mind that ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bsl hereafter ) decided to test the spectroscopic method using da white dwarfs at higher effective temperatures ( @xmath9  k ) where the atmospheres are purely radiative and thus do not suffer from the uncertainties related to the treatment of convective energy transport , and where the assumption of a pure hydrogen composition is certainly justified . from the analysis of a sample of 129 da stars",
    ", bsl determined a mean surface gravity of @xmath10 , in much better agreement with the canonical value of @xmath4 for da stars .",
    "k ( solid line ; left axis ) compared with that of 54 db and dba stars above @xmath11  k ( hatched histogram ; right axis ) . the average masses are 0.585 and 0.598 @xmath12 , respectively . ]",
    "more recently , @xcite obtained high signal - to - noise spectroscopy of all 348 da stars from the palomar green survey and determined the atmospheric parameters for each object using nlte model atmospheres .",
    "if we restrict the range of effective temperature to @xmath13  k , the mean surface gravity of their sample is @xmath14 , in excellent agreement with the results of bsl .",
    "the corresponding mean mass for this sample is @xmath15 using evolutionary models with thick hydrogen layers . as part of our ongoing survey aimed at defining more accurately the empirical boundaries of the instability strip ( see gianninas , bergeron , & fontaine , these proceedings ) , we have been gathering for several years optical spectroscopy of da white dwarfs from the mccook & sion catalog using the steward observatory 2.3 m telescope facility .",
    "the mass distribution for the 667 da stars above 13,000 k is displayed in figure 2 , together with the mass distribution for 54 db and dba stars taken from @xcite ; for the latter , uncertainties with the line broadening theory of helium lines limits the accuracy of the spectroscopic method to @xmath16  k. both mass distributions are in excellent agreement .",
    "the results discussed in the last section indicate that the atmospheric parameters of hot ( @xmath13  k ) da stars are reasonable , and that the high @xmath3 values obtained for cool da stars are not related directly to the spectroscopic method itself .",
    "one of the largest uncertainties in cool white dwarf atmospheres is the treatment of convective energy transport . in an effort to parameterize the convective efficiency in da stars",
    ", @xcite studied a sample of 22 zz ceti stars and showed that the so - called ml2/@xmath17 version of the mixing - length theory yields the best internal consistency between optical and uv effective temperatures , trigonometric parallaxes , @xmath18 magnitudes , and gravitational redshift measurements .",
    "the mass vs.  temperature distribution for our complete sample of da stars using this parameterization is displayed in figure 3 .",
    "the problem with the high masses  or high @xmath3 values  towards low effective temperatures is clearly apparent here .",
    "however , this increase in mass begins not only where convective mixing is believed to occur , but even in the temperature range where zz ceti stars are found . if the larger - than - average mass for zz ceti stars is explained in terms of helium enrichment from the deeper helium convection zone , the hydrogen layers in zz ceti stars need to be as thin as @xmath19 ( see fig .  4 of dufour & bergeron , these proceedings ) , in sharp contrast with values determined for zz ceti stars from asteroseismology .",
    "further insight into the problem with high masses at low effective temperatures may be gained by comparing the masses inferred from the spectroscopic method with those obtained from other methods , namely from trigonometric parallax and gravitational redshift measurements .",
    "we have thus secured high signal - to - noise spectroscopy for 129 da stars , 92 of which have parallaxes available , and 49 of which have gravitational redshifts . in figure 4",
    "we reproduce the spectroscopic masses as a function of effective temperature for our complete sample of da stars discussed in the previous section , and we overplot in the top and bottom panels the masses derived from trigonometric parallax and gravitational redshift measurements , respectively .",
    "the parallax method relies on optical @xmath20 and infrared @xmath21 photometric measurements to constrain the effective temperature and the solid angle @xmath22 between the flux received at earth and that emitted at the surface of the star .",
    "given the distance @xmath23 obtained from the parallax , we obtain directly the radius @xmath24 and thus the photometric mass using evolutionary models .",
    "one of the most obvious features of the distribution of photometric masses in the top panel of figure 4 is the large number of low mass ( @xmath25 ) white dwarfs .",
    "most of these objects are probably unresolved double degenerates for which the flux received at earth corresponds to the contribution of both stars . hence the radii",
    "are overestimated and the masses are underestimated .",
    "if we ignore these low mass objects , the photometric masses do exhibit higher than average masses when compared with the spectrocopic masses at higher temperatures , which are closer to the canonical value of @xmath26 , although the dispersion of the photometric masses is also significantly larger . in some , but",
    "not all cases , the photometric mass exceeds the spectrocopic mass .",
    "it is then possible to adjust individually the atmospheric helium abundances until both methods yield consistent masses .",
    "since the parallax method uses broadband energy distributions that are not affected significantly by the presence of helium ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  4 ) ,",
    "the photometric masses are almost completely independent of the assumed atmospheric composition , in sharp contrast with the spectroscopic method .",
    "we finally note that in the case of the massive ( @xmath27 ) da star lhs 4033 @xcite , the parallax and spectrosocpic masses agree to within 0.01 @xmath12 .    the gravitational redshift method used in the bottom panel of figure 4",
    "is based on the relation between the measured redshift velocity , the mass @xmath28 , and the radius @xmath24 of the star , @xmath29 .",
    "this method provides mass measurements that are almost completely independent of anything else , although the velocity measurements are intrinsically more difficult to obtain than the other types of measurements used with other techniques . in particular , since the redshift mass measurements scale linearly with velocity , low mass white dwarfs are intrisically more difficult to measure , and the errors are correspondingly larger .",
    "nevertheless , if we take at face value the results shown in figure 4 , the redshift masses do not reveal any particular trend at low effective temperatures .",
    "more accurate trigonometric parallax and gravitational redshift measurements of _ individual _ stars may be required , together with some unwavering obsession , to help us further understand the high mass problem observed at low temperatures ."
