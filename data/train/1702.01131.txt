    "denote by @xmath182 the set of sides that @xmath3 and @xmath180 have in common .",
    "then @xmath182 can not contain two adjacent sides @xmath183 : otherwise for the vertex @xmath184 , each side of @xmath180 would have a non - empty intersection with @xmath71 , contradicting the fact that there is a @xmath181 with @xmath118 .",

    "hence @xmath3 is equivalent to the quadrangle @xmath190 , which is of type @xmath144 .",

    "if @xmath193 is also on the top edge of @xmath180 ( i.e. @xmath195 ) , then @xmath3 has only four vertices , namely @xmath196 .",

    "if they share one vertex , we can reduce to type @xmath203 using a transformation if necessary .",
    "note that two common vertices of @xmath180 and @xmath3 can never be connected by an edge of @xmath180 as that edge would be in @xmath182 , so there are at most three common vertices .",
    "if there are three shared vertices , then @xmath3 is a triangle of type @xmath147 , again using a transformation if necessary .",
    "so assume @xmath180 and @xmath3 share two vertices .",
    "together these two points occupy four edges of @xmath180 and each of the other two edges of @xmath180 ( call them @xmath204 and @xmath205 ) contains exactly one vertex of @xmath3 .",

    "we can find a unimodular transformation mapping these sides into the four sides of @xmath57 , hence @xmath3 is of type @xmath144 .    from the classification in theorem [ thm_clas ]",
    ", one can easily deduce the following result from @xcite : @xmath206 for each lattice polygon @xmath0 , and equality holds for minimal polygons of type @xmath147 with @xmath88 even and @xmath207 . for odd @xmath88",
    ", this inequality can be sharpened to @xmath208 , and equality holds for minimal polygons of type @xmath147 with @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",

    "now let s show that we indeed have an upper bound . if @xmath3 is minimal of type @xmath144 , @xmath203 or @xmath202 , then @xmath218 , since there are at most @xmath162 lattice points of @xmath3 on the boundary of @xmath57 and all the others are in @xmath219 this also holds for triangles of type @xmath147 with @xmath108 and @xmath70 non - zero .",
    "if @xmath3 is of type @xmath200 , we obtain the same upper bound @xmath217 after applying a unimodular transformation that maps the bottom edge of @xmath3 to the left upper diagonal edge of @xmath180 .",
