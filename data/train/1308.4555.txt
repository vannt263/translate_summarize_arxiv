    "the sn impostor sn  2009ip is an lbv star @xcite that experienced a series of outbursts starting in 2009 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there were two outbursts in 2012 : the 2012a outburst that was similar to the previous outbursts , and the 2012b outburst in september 2012 that was much more energetic than the previous outbursts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is no consensus on the nature of the 2012a and 2012b outbursts ( e.g. @xcite ) , and not even on whether the lbv primary star survived the 2012 outbursts or exploded as a core collapse supernova ( ccsn ) .",
    "the peak luminosity of the 2012b outburst and the p - cygni absorption wings that extend to @xmath2 brought @xcite to suggest that the 2012a outburst was a weak sn event , while the major 2012b outburst is a result of the collision of the sn ejecta with previously ejected gas ( also @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite noted that the photosphere expansion velocity of @xmath3 during the 2012b outburst implies that the gas that accelerated the photosphere must have originated long after the peak of the 2012a event .",
    "namely , the gas was ejected long after the star has ceased to exist according to the scenario proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that the star did survive the 2012 outbursts due to the fact that peaks and troughs are present in the declining light curve of the 2012b outburst .",
    "@xcite noted that the september 2011 outburst already had such wide p - cygni wings , and raised the possibility that the 2012b outburst was not a sn after all .",
    "the early outbursts of sn  2009ip were compared with the 18371856 great eruption of @xmath4 carinae @xcite .",
    "@xmath4 carinae also had a small fraction of the mass ejected during the great eruption moving at high velocities @xcite of up to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "@xcite , for a terminal periastron passage , and @xcite , for repeated periastron passages , went further and argued that the 2012b outburst was powered by mass accretion onto a main sequence ( ms ) or a wolf - rayet ( wr ) stellar companion , much like their model for powering the great eruption of @xmath4 carinae @xcite .",
    "in the scenarios considered by @xcite the major 2012b outburst of @xmath6 was powered by @xmath7 accreted onto the companion during a periastron passage ( the first passage ) of the binary system when the companion was inside the extended primary envelope .",
    "the major open question in the binary scenarios for sn  2009ip is how such an interaction can give rise to ejecta with velocities of @xmath8 . in this first study",
    "we limit ourselves to outbursts with low - mass high - velocity ejecta , such as the 2011 outburst of sn 2009ip and the great eruption of @xmath4 carinae .",
    "the numerical setup is described in section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "our results are described in section [ sec : results ] , and our summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",

    "the @xmath17 plane is the lower boundary of the computational domain , just above the outskirts of the temporary common envelope , @xmath18 above the equatorial plane .",
    "the symmetry of the flow allows us to simulate the jet - shell interaction only in the @xmath19 half space .",
    "the jet is injected along the @xmath20 direction and from the bottom three cells of the computational grid .    for the 2012b outburst of sn  2009ip @xcite suggest that the interaction lasted for @xmath21  days during which the companion accreted @xmath7 .",
    "we consider the less energetic 2011 outburst and simulate only @xmath22  hours of jets launching episode , but assume a similar accretion rate .",
    "we also take most of the gravitational energy released by the accretion process to be channelled to the jets , such that the kinetic power in each jet is @xmath23 .",
    "the jets velocity is taken to be @xmath15 , similar to the wind velocity of the secondary in @xmath4 carinae @xcite .",
    "we also simulate a case with the same power but with @xmath24 , similar to the escape velocity from very massive ms and wr stars .",
    "the total ejected mass in the two jets in our simulation is @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) for the jets velocity of @xmath27 at 8 hours simulation time ( @xmath28 at 11 hours simulation time ) .",
    "the secondary is a ms star , and we take the jets radius to be @xmath29 , @xmath30 times the secondary radius . as the companion accretes only @xmath31 , and by our assumption most of the released gravitational energy is carried by the jets , we do nt expect the radius of the secondary star to change by much for the duration of the simulation .",
    "we assume that the jets interact with a shell , that might actually be an extended envelope .",
    "such an extended envelope might be formed around unstable lbv and agb stars experiencing high mass loss rates ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lbv star @xmath4 carinae had a huge atmosphere during its great eruption , when the photosphere was at @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the radius of pulsating agb stars can vary by a factor of @xmath33 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such an extended envelope is not a wind , and it is expected to be rather smooth and not clumpy as winds might be . in the proposed model",
    "the extended envelope results both from the unstable phase of the lbv primary star and from the tidal disturbance caused by the companion .",
    "we assume that this expansion of the envelope results in a steep density profile .",
    "one might take the steep density profile as a requirement of our model to obtain high velocities .",

    "the initial temperature of the shell is set to @xmath39 .",
    "we let the jet interact with a ` cloud ' ( see figure [ fig : setup ] ) , namely , part of the shell .",
    "when we took a full shell ( extended in the entire @xmath40 directions ) we obtained identical results .",
    "for numerical stability we allow a low density gas , @xmath41 , to fill the space between the initial jet and the shell ( cloud ) at @xmath42 , extended in the entire @xmath43 plane between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the ambient density outside the shell is set to be @xmath46 at a temperature of @xmath47 . as the material in the shell heats up to high temperatures , @xmath48 , radiation pressure dominates and we take the adiabatic index to be @xmath49 .",
    "as the jet hits the shell a shock wave is formed . because of the steeply declining density the shock accelerates outward , and with it the shell material , up to velocities of @xmath50",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig : results_3000 ] for the @xmath51 case , and in figure [ fig : results_2000 ] for the @xmath24 case .",
    "after the jet breaks out of the shell the acceleration ceases .",
    "however , in reality the secondary star orbits the primary star and so the jets source moves , allowing the jet to encounter additional shell material . during the several hours jet - activity period the secondary will move @xmath52 near periastron @xcite , so that the total accelerated mass can be @xmath33 times larger than the mass we obtain here .     +    to quantify the mass distribution at different velocities we plot in figure [ fig : vel_hist ] the value of @xmath53 as function of velocity , as well as the total mass above a certain velocity @xmath54 . in panel",
    "[ subfigure : vel_hist1 ] , we present @xmath53 for the @xmath51 case at two times as indicated , and the same at a late time for the @xmath24 case .",
    "although reaching lower velocities than in the @xmath15 case , jets of @xmath24 can also accelerate gas to very high velocities . in panel",
    "[ subfigure : vel_hist2 ] we show the distribution of the original jet and shell media constituents for the @xmath51 case .",
    "the material at velocities larger than @xmath55 is predominantly shell material .",
    "panel [ subfigure : vel_hist3 ] depicts the results for @xmath51 cases where the shell mass was either 3 times larger or 3 times lower than our fiducial case presented in the lower panel of figure [ fig : setup ] . when the density of the shell is 3 times larger than in our fiducial case , the inner boundary of the shell is denser than the jet .",
    "we find that such an encounter does not lead to efficient acceleration to very high velocities . in panel",
    "[ subfigure : vel_hist4 ] we plot @xmath54 for the @xmath51 case .    for the @xmath55 case",
    "the total mass ( two jets ) of gas having a velocity of @xmath56 is @xmath57 .",
    "the photosphere during the pre-2012b outbursts is at @xmath58 @xcite , so that the hydrogen column density and density are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "is this gas sufficient to account for the absorption observed by @xcite in the 2011 outburst of sn  2009ip ?",
    "interestingly , these values are very similar to those of the absorbing gas in the broad absorption lines ( bal ) quasar lbqs  1206 + 1052 , where clear balmer absorption lines are detected @xcite .",
    "further study that includes calculation of the ionization stages of various elements is required and planned for the future , but it seems that the amount of very high - velocity gas obtained in our simulations can in principle account for the observations of the 2011 outburst of sn  2009ip .",
    "we briefly comment on two of our assumptions , that the secondary wind plays no role in the interaction , and that the radiative cooling is small .",
    "we are confident that the wind from the secondary star plays no role during the unstable phases of the primary star , when the primary stellar envelope expands and its mass loss rate is high .",
    "the accretion onto the secondary star is triggered by dense clumps formed in the post - shock region of the lbv dense envelope or wind , as was calculated and demonstrated for the accretion onto the companion of @xmath4 carinae near periastron passages ; neither the wind nor the radiation pressure of the accreting secondary star can prevent accretion @xcite . in @xmath4 carinae the lbv wind density , as used in the above calculations , is much lower than the wind density in the bloated envelope of the lbv primary in our model of sn2009ip , and the secondary wind and radiation pressure play an even smaller role than in present @xmath4 carinae . as well , as in the case of the winds interaction in @xmath4 carinae @xcite , the wind from the lbv star bends the wind of the companion , being an o star or a wr star , such that the wind from the secondary star does not influence at all the interaction region near the lbv star that is studied here .    to explore the role of radiative cooling",
    "we compare the photon diffusion time with expansion time . in figure",
    "[ fig : time_evolution ] we show the evolution of the value of @xmath53 as function of velocity .",
    "the main acceleration occurs within @xmath61h around @xmath62h .",

    "@xmath64 the velocity is @xmath65 , and the density is @xmath66 .",
    "the distance from this region outward is @xmath67 , and for electron scattering the optical depth is @xmath68 .",
    "the photon diffusion time out of this point is @xmath69 hours , much longer than the diffusion time . at points",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 the velocities are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and the diffusion times are @xmath74h and @xmath75h , respectively .",
    "these simple calculations show that radiative cooling is important and must be considered in future calculations . for the parameters used here radiative cooling proceeds",
    "much faster than acceleration for @xmath76 . for gas at these velocities we overestimate the mass , but our results hold for lower velocities .",
    "we expect that a more compact interaction region will give higher velocities",
    ". this can be the case for narrower jets from a wr secondary star that interact closer to the launching region , as the flow time is shorter and the diffusion time is longer .",
    "it is possible that these results hint to a wr secondary star if sn  2009ip is indeed a binary star .",
    "there is an ongoing debate regarding the nature of the sn impostor sn  2009ip and the several outbursts that followed its 2009 eruption .",
    "most controversial is the nature of the 2012a+2012b outbursts @xcite , with three main types of scenarios : ( @xmath77 ) single terminal explosion of the star ( either in the 2012a or 2012b outburst ) .",
    "namely , a sn explosion which can be followed by interaction with the csm @xcite or by a quark - nova @xcite .",
    "( @xmath78 ) non - terminal single star eruption @xcite with one outburst in 2012a followed by shell collision for the 2012b outburst , or two outbursts in 2012a and 2012b .",
    "( @xmath79 ) binary interaction @xcite .    in the binary model the lbv primary enters an unstable phase that triggers binary interaction near periastron passages @xcite .",
    "the main energy source is the launching of two opposite jets by the secondary star as it accretes mass from the primary envelope .",
    "as the jets are launched at @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the escape velocity from the secondary star , one of the challenges for the binary model is to account for gas moving at @xmath82 as observed in the 2011 outburst @xcite and in the 2012a outburst @xcite . in the present study we addressed this challenge .",
    "our flow structure that is depicted schematically in figure [ fig : setup ] has two basic assumptions .",
    "( @xmath77 ) a binary companion launches jets in the outskirts of the primary envelope .",
    "this is taken from the binary model @xcite .",
    "( @xmath78 ) gas with a steep density profile resides within @xmath83 around the binary system .",
    "the shell might actually be composed of clouds and segments .",
    "the total mass in such a shell is @xmath84 .",
    "we expect such an extended envelope to be formed from the unstable primary phase and the strong binary interaction .",
    "our assumption of the existence of this shell ( extended envelope ) , will be examined in a future work .",
    "we numerically studied the propagation of the jets through the extended envelope . in the present demonstrative paper",
    "we simulate only two types of jets , with velocities of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and vary only the density of the shell , not its size or profile .",
    "the results of our simulations for initial jet velocities of @xmath15 and @xmath24 are presented in figures [ fig : results_3000 ] and [ fig : results_2000 ] , respectively . while the jet is well collimated , the interaction with the shell creates an outflowing gas with a large opening angle .",
    "although the flow remains non - spherical , i.e. , has a bipolar structure when both jets are considered , no fine tuning of the observing angle is required in order to observe the absorption lines . after the gas expands to more than several @xmath87",
    ", the absorption lines should be detected from most directions .",
    "we found that for the parameters used here radiative cooling will reduce the amount of gas with velocities of @xmath88 .",
    "jets launched by a wr companion will be narrower and denser than the jets simulated here , with shorter flow time and longer photon diffusion time .",
    "this will allow acceleration to higher velocities .",
    "we take this as a hint that in the binary model of sn  2009ip the secondary star should be a wr star @xcite .    in section [ sec :",
    "results ] we estimated that there is sufficient gas to explain the observation of @xcite of absorption lines at @xmath50 in the 2011 outburst .",
    "the energy and duration of the 2012a+b outbursts are @xmath89 times those of the 2011 outburst . scaling from several hours to several days",
    ", we deduce that our flow structure can account for @xmath90 of gas with @xmath91 in the 2012b outburst .",
    "it is desired to explore the parameters space to find a more efficient acceleration flow structure , e.g. , taking a wr companion , such that more mass will be accelerated to very fast velocities .",
    "this is the task of an ongoing research .",
