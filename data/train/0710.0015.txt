    "starless cores likely represent the earliest stage of the formation of a star . in the standard view of star formation",
    ", cores form out an initially magnetically sub - critical cloud , and evolve in a quasi - static fashion through ambipolar diffusion @xcite . in the opposite picture , cores are dynamic objects that form by shocks in a turbulent flow , fragment and collapse ( or disappear ) in a few crossing times @xcite .",
    "velocity measurements can provide important constraints on these two scenarios .",
    "for example , @xcite examined the kinematics of l1544 and inferred infall velocities up to 0.1 km s@xmath4 _ a priori _ incompatible with sub - critical ambipolar diffusion models .",
    "however , @xcite argued that these velocities can be understood if the core is super - critical .",
    "line of sight velocities in cores can be established from observations of self - absorbed line profiles . in an infalling core ,",
    "if the excitation temperature increases towards the center ( as one can expect in a centrally condensed core with a roughly constant temperature ) , self - absorbed lines are expected to be asymmetric , with a blue peak brighter than the red peak ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this technique has been used in the past to detect collapse motions in starless cores and protostars ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "one of the major difficulties of this technique is the large degree of chemical complexity within these objects .",
    "for example , numerous molecules are observed to deplete in the densest regions of starless cores ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , thus hampering our ability to measure the velocity in the dense central regions of these objects .    nevertheless , with a detailed knowledge of the chemistry of these objects , one can choose appropriate molecular transitions to trace different part of the cores , and unveil their radial kinematic structure @xcite . in this paper , we use line observations of @xmath0co , c@xmath1o , hco@xmath2 , h@xmath0co@xmath2 , dco@xmath2 and n@xmath3h@xmath2 to reconstruct the velocity profile of the barnard 68 core ( hereinafter b68 ) . with a well defined physical @xcite and chemical @xcite structure",
    ", this core is an ideal target for such a study . for this",
    "we compare the observed line profiles with the predictions of a chemical network coupled with a radiative transfer code .",
    "the paper is organized as follow .",
    "observations are presented in  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "the analysis is detailed in ",
    "[ sec : analysis - results ] , and the results are discussed in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "maps of h@xmath0co@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) ( @xmath5 ghz ) , hco@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) ( @xmath6 ghz ) , n@xmath3h@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) ( @xmath7 ghz ) c@xmath1o ( 1 - 0 ) ( @xmath8 ghz ) , dco@xmath2 ( 2 - 1 ) ( @xmath9 ghz ) , dco@xmath2 ( 3 - 2 ) ( @xmath10 ghz ) and hco@xmath2 ( 3 - 2 ) ( @xmath11 ghz ) transitions were observed towards b68 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; j2000 ) in april 2002 and september 2002 with the iram-30 m telescope . the @xmath0co ( 2 - 1 ) ( @xmath14 ghz ) transition was observed in september 2003 with the _ caltech submillimeter observatory _ ( cso ) .",
    "these observations have already been presented in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and we refer the reader to these papers for technical details .",
    "transitions of hco@xmath2 ( 4 - 3 ) ( @xmath15 ghz ) and n@xmath3h@xmath2 ( 3 - 2 ) ( @xmath16 ghz ) were observed in august 2005 using the _ atacama pathfinder experiment _ telescope ( apex ) .",
    "the apex-2a receiver was used together with the ffts spectrometer , which provides a spectral resolution of 61 khz .",
    "the telescope half power beam size is 22  at 280 ghz and 17at 357 ghz .",
    "the data were calibrated using the chopper wheel method , and the system temperature was @xmath17100 k at 280 ghz and 130 - 180 k at 357 ghz .",
    "the observations were converted on the @xmath18 scale assuming a main beam efficiency of 70% and a forward efficiency of 95% ( c. de breuck , priv .",
    "these observations were obtained in beam switching mode .",
    "[ fig1 ] present the observations together with our model predictions ( see   [ sec : analysis - results ] for a description of the model ) .",
    "the lines show a variety of different profiles , from gaussian to self - absorbed and asymmetric double peaked profiles .",
    "c@xmath1o , @xmath0co and h@xmath0co@xmath2 are probably optically thin ( or only moderately optically thick ) , and have centrally peaked gaussian profiles .",
    "on the other hand , hco@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) lines are self - reversed and show the typical blue asymmetry ( blue peak brighter than the red peak ) .",
    "these line profiles suggests that collapsing motions are present along the line of sight .",
    "surprisingly , self - absorbed hco@xmath2 ( 4 - 3 ) , dco@xmath2 ( 3 - 2 ) , and the central component of the n@xmath3h@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) line exhibit red asymmetry ( red peak brighter than the blue peak ) , indicating expansion .",
    "finally , the dco@xmath2 ( 2 - 1 ) line is self - absorbed but symmetric , hinting at the presence of static gas along the line of sight .",
    "the absorption dip velocity of self - reversed lines is consistent with the @xmath19 of the source ( 3.31 @xmath20 ) , as determined from the @xmath21 ( 1 - 0 ) line . in the following , we model the line profiles in order to constrain the line - of - sight velocity of the core .",
    "we have modelled the spectral line profiles shown on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] following the approach described in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the abundance profiles were computed using a chemical network that includes gas grain interactions , as well as the fractionation reactions for carbon , oxygen , and deuterium @xcite .",
    "these abundance profiles were used to compute the line emission using a 1-d monte carlo radiative transfer code @xcite .",
    "these model predictions were convolved at the appropriate spatial resolution in order to be compared with the observations , assuming a distance of 125 pc .    the density profile from @xcite and the gas and dust temperature from @xcite were used .",
    "we have adopted the same initial abundances and cosmic ionization rate as in the @xcite `` best - fit '' model . as a first approach",
    ", we have assumed that no systematic radial motions are present in the core .",
    "we have used the turbulent velocity profile determined by @xcite from c@xmath1o ( 1 - 0 ) line observations .",
    "the turbulent velocity contribution is 0.3 @xmath22 ( fwhm ) at the surface of the core , and decreases towards the center down to 0.15 km s@xmath4 .",
    "rotation of the cloud has been neglected .",
    "both the @xmath0co ( 2 - 1 ) and the h@xmath0co@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) lines have an unresolved hyperfine structure that need to be taken into account in order to properly model the line profiles . following the approach used by @xcite , we have artificially broadened these two lines by 0.13 km s@xmath4 , which corresponds to the separation between the two hyperfine components of each species @xcite .    on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we present the abundances predicted by our chemical model . from this figure",
    "we can roughly estimate which lines originate in different parts of the core .",
    "for example , the hco@xmath2 abundance peaks in the outer part of the core ( @xmath23 ) and decreases towards the center because of the freeze - out of its parent molecule co. consequently , hco@xmath2 lines probe predominantly the outer layer .",
    "both n@xmath3h@xmath2 and dco@xmath2 abundances peak deeper inside , at an @xmath24 of 5 and 13 respectively",
    ". therefore lines from these two species preferentially trace the inner regions of the core . of course , excitation effects are also important , and different transitions of the same molecule are expected to probe different depths in the core as well .",
    "for example , the hco@xmath2 ( 4 - 3 ) opacity is likely lower that the ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) lines , and thus the hco@xmath2 ( 4 - 3 ) line probably arises from deeper regions than the hco@xmath2 ( 3 - 2 ) and ( 1 - 0 ) lines .",
    "altogether , our observations suggest the presence of complex radial motions in b68 , with inwards motions in the outer part of the core  as indicated by the blue hco@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) line profiles  and outward motions in the inner region  as shown by the hco@xmath2 ( 4 - 3 ) , dco@xmath2 ( 3 - 2 ) and n@xmath3h@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) lines . in addition , the dco@xmath2 ( 2 - 1 ) line hints at the presence of an intermediate static region between these two parts .    in order to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have computed the line profiles for the step - like velocity profile represented on fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . by convention",
    ", negative velocities correspond to inward motions , while positive velocities correspond to outward motions .",
    "the velocity is assumed to be negative ( -0.045 km s@xmath4 ) at radius greater than 8,000 au , and positive ( 0.025 km s@xmath4 ) at smaller radii .",
    "[ fig1 ] compares the observations with our model predictions for this velocity profile .",
    "the fit is not perfect .",
    "however , given the complexity of our modeling  chemical network coupled with a radiative transfer model  the overall agreement between the model predictions and observations is fairly good .",
    "the model reproduces quite well the infall asymmetry of hco@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 3 - 2 ) , as well as the blue asymmetry of the ( 4 - 3 ) line .",
    "h@xmath0co@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) , n@xmath3h@xmath2 ( 3 - 2 ) , c@xmath1o ( 1 - 0 ) and @xmath0co ( 2 - 1 ) line profiles are also well matched .",
    "although the model predicts correct integrated intensities for dco@xmath2 ( 3 - 2 ) and n@xmath3h@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) , it does not reproduce the blue asymmetries seen in these lines .",
    "the predicted line profiles have a gaussian shape , whereas the observed lines are self - absorbed . in these cases",
    ", it appears that our model underestimates the opacity of these lines .",
    "our observations and modelling indicate that the outer part of the core is collapsing while the inner part is expanding .",
    "the velocities in both regions are relatively small ( a few tens of meters per second ) and are largely sub - sonic .",
    "the transition between the collapsing and expanding region occurs at a radius of about 8,000 au .",
    "it is important to note that the fit to the observations is probably not unique .",
    "however , large changes in the transition and velocities between the regions are likely ruled out .",
    "as already mentioned , our model does not reproduce the asymmetries of the n@xmath3h@xmath2 ( 1 - 0 ) and dco@xmath2 line profiles , due to an underestimating of the opacity .",
    "there are several possible explanations for this discrepancy .",
    "first , our chemical model might not predict the correct abundance profile for these two species .",
    "for example , increasing the dco@xmath2 abundance at intermediate radii , with a subsequent reduction at small radii to keep the column density constant would increase the opacity of line without changing the line flux significantly ( which is correctly predicted ) . indeed",
    ", our model predicts a dco@xmath2 ( 2 - 1 ) line intensity at @xmath25 that is lower than observed ( see fig . 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "second , the physical structure of the core is also somewhat uncertain .",
    "for example , the temperature profile may be slightly different than the one predicted by @xcite ( see * ? ? ? * ) , although small changes ( @xmath26 k ) in the temperature profile were found to have little effect on the line intensities .",
    "turbulence at the center of the core might also be different that what assumed here .",
    "the turbulent profile was determined by @xcite using c@xmath1o observations , which are not a good probe of the innermost regions of the core because of heavy depletion .",
    "decreasing the turbulent velocity profile in the innermost region of the core would also increase the opacity of these two lines .",
    "regardless of the discrepancy with our model predictions , we emphasize these two line profiles , together with the hco@xmath2 ( 4 - 3 ) line profile , unambiguously indicate the presence of outwards motions at the center of the core .",
    "we found that no constant infalling velocity profile could reproduce the observations .",
    "the step - like velocity profile we obtain is suggestive of the presence of radial oscillations in the core",
    ". small non - radial oscillations of the outer layers of the core around a stable equilibrium have been proposed by @xcite and @xcite to interpret the asymmetry of the cs ( 2 - 1 ) and hco@xmath2 ( 3 - 2 ) lines observed in barnard 68 .",
    "@xcite also suggested that , in addition to the surface oscillations seen in the cs ( 2 - 1 ) line , some radial oscillation might also be present .",
    "our observations and modeling are in agreement with this hypothesis .",
    "@xcite proposed a hydrodynamic model for the evolution of cores in quasi - equilibrium . in their modeling ,",
    "a small perturbation of a stable core ( according to the bonnor - ebert criterion ) is found to result in damped oscillations around the equilibrium position .",
    "@xcite showed that the surface pattern observed in the cs ( 2 - 1 ) line towards b68 is consistent with the ( n = 1 , l = m = 2 ) quadripolar oscillation mode for a specific orientation ( @xmath27 ) . for the same oscillation mode ,",
    "the radial velocity is qualitatively similar to the one obtained in this study , but is out of phase : the inner part of the core has a negative radial velocity , while the outer part of the core has a positive velocity . at the other half of the oscillation cycle ,",
    "the velocity would be reversed and in qualitative agreement with the profile we obtain ( e. keto , _ priv .",
    "_ )    as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , the presence of oscillations in b68 suggests that the core is relatively old , typically older than a few sound speed crossing times ( @xmath28 yr ) .",
    "this is comparable to the ambipolar diffusion timescale at the center of the core and more than one order of magnitude higher than the free - fall time scale ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 yr respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is also about an order of magnitude higher than the age of the core as determined from the degree of co depletion ( @xmath31yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for @xmath32",
    "yr , @xcite model predicts a c@xmath1o ( 1 - 0 ) line intensity that is three time smaller than the observations , while at @xmath33 yr , the greater co depletion leads to an even greater mismatch between observations and model predictions .",
    "the n@xmath3h@xmath2 , hco@xmath2 h@xmath0co@xmath2 , and dco@xmath2 would also be underestimated by the model because of the freeze - out of their parent of their precursors , n@xmath3 , co and @xmath0co .",
    "thus the `` chemical age '' of b68 inferred from the co depletion appears to be hard to reconcile with the `` dynamical age '' implied by the presence of surface oscillations .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the sound crossing time in b68 to typical statistical starless core lifetimes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) . using sub - millimeter continuum emission maps , @xcite obtained lifetimes of @xmath34 years which are in good agreement with the age of the b68 determined from co depletion , but again about an order of magnitude higher than the sound crossing time .",
    "the present study emphasizes the importance of understanding the chemistry to constrain the kinematics of starless using spectral line profiles . because of the strong chemical gradients that exist in these cores  as well as excitation effects  different lines can be used to selectively trace different parts of the core .",
    "we have demonstrated that , using lines that are appropriately chosen , it is possible to reconstruct the core radial velocity profile . in b68 , our observations and",
    "modelling suggest the presence of complex line - of - sight motions that are consistent radial oscillations .",
    "the presence of such oscillation indicates that some core are long - lived , with lifetimes about an order of magnitude higher than those derived from their chemical evolution or sub - millimeter surveys .",
    "so far , oscillations have been inferred in only one other core , fest 1 - 457 @xcite . clearly , similar studies on a larger number of cores are needed to establish if such cores are common .",
