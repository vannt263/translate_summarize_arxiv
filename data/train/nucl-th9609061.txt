    "investigating heavy ion collisions offers one experimental method of probing nuclei away from the typical low temperature and density , and a number of experiments are underway studying the breakup of nuclei , contributing greatly to our understanding  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical investigations of these properties have been instigated , thermal  @xcite , statistical  @xcite transport  @xcite and percolative  @xcite models all offering insights into the properties of fragmenting nuclei .    in a previous set of papers  @xcite an exactly solvable canonical ensemble model",
    "was developed for studying the multifragmentation of nuclei induced by high energy collisions .",
    "detailed properties of the cluster distributions such as inclusive yields and correlations were explored . in this paper , we study the statistical and thermal properties of nuclei using the same model , extending results presented in  @xcite .",
    "this model gives a unified description of multifragmentation phenomena and the thermodynamic properties of hadronic matter , such as its equation of state and the nuclear compressibility .",
    "simple expressions for these quantities are obtained which extrapolate or connect between a low temperature nearly degenerate fermi gas to a high temperature ideal maxwell - boltzmann gas of nucleons .",
    "importantly , the effects of the fragmentation degrees of freedom on the thermodynamics is manifestly included .",
    "questions related to very high temperatures and particle and anti - particle production will be developed in a subsequent paper .",
    "given the partition function @xmath0 for a system of @xmath1 nucleons at a given volume @xmath2 and temperature @xmath3 we can determine the thermodynamic functions by taking various partial derivatives , i.e. the internal energy and pressure are given by @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "additional partial derivatives lead to such important quantities as the specific heat and isothermal compressibility , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and thermodynamic potentials such as the entropy and gibbs free energy can be related to these quantities , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "our interest of course is not in the partition function itself , but rather in these derived functions , and as such the partition function is merely a means to that end .",
    "this section constructs a partition function for fragmenting nuclear matter .",
    "it does so by investigating the thermodynamic functions at both low and high temperatures and densities . at low temperature / high density ,",
    "the nucleons coalesce into a single nucleus which can be modeled as a degenerate fermi gas with skyrme interactions . at high temperature / low density ,",
    "the nucleons evaporate into a maxwell - boltzmann gas of individual nucleons . with these results firmly in mind , a statistical fragmentation model is introduced whose parameters depend on the thermodynamics in a way consistent with the high and low temperature limits , yet allowing more complicated fragmentation patterns at intermediate temperatures .",
    "rhs always diverges in the infinite limit the remaining freedom in the model is eliminated by assuming that the cluster yields follow a power law .",
    "interestingly these minimal assumptions lead to a model surprisingly rich in physics as we shall see in the next section .      at zero temperature ,",
    "the nucleus can be treated as a degenerate fermi gas , with fermi momentum @xmath10 given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spin - isospin degeneracy factor and @xmath13 is the density . at normal density @xmath14 nucleons @xmath15 ,",
    "nucleons are non - relativistic and the fermi energy and momentum are related by @xmath16 . from the above expression for the fermi momentum , we see that @xmath17 . at low temperatures , the total kinetic energy for such a fermi gas is given by  @xcite @xmath18 however , the nucleons do interact .",
    "interactions between the nucleons can be taken into account by using a density dependent skyrme interaction  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the internal energy of a nucleus is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are skyrme parameters ( for simplicity , temperature independent ) determined by fixing @xmath22 the binding energy per particle at zero temperature @xmath23 to the empirical value for @xmath24 at @xmath25 ( about 8.0 mev / nucleon at zero temperature ) and having this as the maximum of @xmath24 .",
    "the density dependent repulsive term should appear with a higher power of @xmath26 than the attractive part , so that the nucleus does not collapse , and thus requires @xmath27 .",
    "commonly used values for @xmath28 are @xmath29 ( three body interaction ) and @xmath30 ( finite range term )  @xcite .",
    "having specified the internal energy , we can now determine any other thermodynamic function .",
    "the specific heat @xmath31 , and entropy @xmath32 are therefore @xmath33 the partition function can now be determined from @xmath34 , which gives @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "> from this partition function it is easy to determine the pressure and compressibility . @xmath38      at high temperature and/or low density , but below meson and particle - antiparticle production thresholds , the hadronic properties are that of an ideal maxwell - boltzmann gas , with @xmath39 where the entropy @xmath40 is given by the sackur - tetrode law and @xmath41 .",
    "we expect that nuclei vaporize into individual nucleons at @xmath42 , the binding energy per particle .",
    "the partition function consistent with these thermodynamic functions is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 .      in the region between the ideal fermi gas limit and the ideal maxwell - boltzmann gas limit , the effects of the fragmentation of the initial nucleus must be taken into account when considering thermodynamic issues . to account for these effects ,",
    "we employ a model developed initially to study multifragmentation phenomena  @xcite .",
    "this model has the correct high and low temperature limits , as determined in the previous sections , but has features similar to that of a bose gas in the intermediate range .    to describe the fragmentation of a nucleus into all possible modes of breakup , a weight is given to each possibility .",
    "the weight chosen is @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are functions of the thermodynamic variables @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the cluster size dependence of the weight and @xmath50 is the fragmentation vector , with @xmath51 the number of fragments with @xmath52 nucleons such that @xmath53 . with this choice of weight",
    "the canonical partition function @xmath54 is a polynomial in @xmath55 , given by @xmath56 with @xmath57 the multiplicity .",
    "given the partition function , all thermodynamic properties of the model can be obtained , as well as ensemble averages .",
    "for example , the mean number of clusters of size @xmath52 is @xmath58 the partition functions themselves can be obtained using a recursive procedure defined by the constraint @xmath59 , which gives @xmath60 where @xmath61 . the whole procedure is easily implemented by computer .",
    "the parameters @xmath55 determine the thermodynamic aspects of the models and as such need to be determined .",
    "they are most easily determined by considering the partition function at high and low multiplicity . when the multiplicity is large @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "clearly this is the high temperature limit , and @xmath46 is simply the ideal gas @xmath46 introduced in section  [ sec : high - temp ] , given by @xmath64 and involves the volume of the system @xmath2 , the thermal wavelength @xmath65 , and the dimensionality of the system @xmath66 .",
    "the term @xmath67 in the weight arises from the thermal motion of each fragment .",
    "since the overall motion is zero , this should be replaced by @xmath68 to reflect the center of momentum constraint . when the multiplicity is small @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "assuming that the @xmath46 parameter is removed by the conservation of momentum constraint describe above , this shows @xmath47 to be given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : y - nocutoff ] ) .",
    "a correction to the internal excitations however needs to be made at high temperatures to reflect their finite lifetimes .",
    "koonin and randrup  @xcite argue that a simple cutoff is effective , which results in @xmath71 here @xmath24 is the binding energy per particle , @xmath72 is the level spacing parameter ( related to the fermi energy ) and @xmath73 is the cutoff temperature .",
    "so the term @xmath74 in the weight arises from the binding and internal excitations of each fragment .",
    "the only parameter now to determine is @xmath49 .",
    "since the mass yield distributions are often well represented by a power law  @xcite , we choose @xmath49 simply to reproduce this important experimental fact .",
    "if @xmath75 , then in the grand canonical limit @xmath76 . typically @xmath77 is found between two and three , and we have chosen @xmath78 as representative for calculations made in this paper .",
    "in this section we consider the various fundamental thermodynamic functions of fragmenting nuclei , namely the pressure , compressibility and gibbs free energy ( section  [ sec : pressure ] ) , the internal energy and specific heat ( section  [ sec : energy ] ) , and the entropy ( section  [ sec : entropy ] ) .",
    "interesting features of the functions are explored , although a detailed examination of their origin is postponed till the next section .",
    "a brief accounting of such properties has already been given  @xcite .",
    "since the partition function can be expressed succinctly as a function of @xmath55 , derivatives of @xmath79 with respect to these variables will appear and reappear in computations of thermodynamic functions .",
    "fortunately for this model , derivatives with respect to @xmath55 yield expectation values of the multiplicity , i.e. @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "a general derivation of these identities is included in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "the hadronic equation of state is of much interest since the pressure and incompressibility reflect the behavior of matter at fixed temperatures and varying volumes .",
    "a simple expression can be obtained for this equation of state by using the @xmath83 and the partition function of eq .",

    "the above equation shows the importance of the mean multiplicity in the behavior of @xmath89 . for low @xmath90 , @xmath69 , and",
    "the pressure reduces to the fermi gas and skyrme pressure @xmath86 . at high @xmath90 ,",
    "@xmath62 and the ideal maxwell - boltzmann gas pressure @xmath87 in @xmath89 dominates .",

    "figure  [ fig : pressure](a ) plots the pressure for several temperatures for @xmath91",
    ".    the low temperature component of the pressure is quite interesting .",
    "it is responsible for the pressure rising as the volume increases over a range of volumes at low enough temperatures , a feature characteristic of a van der waals gas or a liquid - gas phase instability  @xcite .",
    "it arises due to the nuclear interactions . to see this phase instability more clearly",

    ", there is an effect due to the fluctuation in the mean number of clusters .",
    "the behavior of the compressibility is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure](b ) . from the figure",
    ", the phase instability appears first at @xmath97 , @xmath98 mev , the point where @xmath99 and its derivative are both zero .",
    "another method of seeing this instability is to consider the gibbs free energy @xmath100 .",
    "figure  [ fig : gibbs ] shows that @xmath101 vs. @xmath89 is multivalued below a critical temperature , a clear indication of a phase instability .    in nuclear physics ,",
    "one usually refers to the incompressibility @xmath102 , which if @xmath103 mev gives at @xmath104 @xmath105 for @xmath29 , this model @xmath106 mev , consistent with the usually quoted value for the incompressibility .",
    "the energy and specific heat are important quantities also , especially when the volume is fixed and the temperature is changing .",
    "the internal energy decomposes into low and high temperature components just as the pressure does , namely @xmath107 where @xmath108 is simply the cutoff corrected low temperature energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec - heat](a ) plots this behavior for a number of densities , which reveals little except for the monotonic increasing nature of the energy .",
    "the specific heat on the other hand is more revealing . using @xmath6 ,",
    "one arrives at @xmath109 and fig .",
    "[ fig : spec - heat](b ) illustrates the behavior of @xmath110 for @xmath111 , @xmath91 .",
    "the ideal gas limit is seen in the first term @xmath112 . the low temperature fermi gas result is contained in the second term @xmath113 .",
    "the last term involving the multiplicity fluctuations gives rise to a peak in @xmath114 when @xmath115 .",
    "the variance induced peak is quite interesting . as we shall see in section  [ sec",
    ": bose - einstein ] , it is analogous to condensation in an ideal bose - einstein gas , a critical transition which has been extensively studied .",
    "the entropy of fragmenting nuclei can be obtained from the relation @xmath116 which gives @xmath117 when @xmath69 , the entropy is that of a nearly degenerate fermi gas of @xmath1 nucleons confined to a cluster of size @xmath1 , plus a contribution from the motion of this cluster which is coupled to a heat bath in the canonical ensemble .",

    "( [ eq : sackur - tetrode ] ) . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "their is a critical point where a latent heat must be overcome , causing a change in volume .",

    "the contribution from the thermal motion of the largest cluster has been subtracted out so that @xmath121 as @xmath122 .",
    "this is equivalent to requiring the total momentum of the system to be zero , a correction consistently made throughout these calculations .",
    "the thermodynamic functions strongly suggest a critical point , which we determine explicitly in this section .",

    "otherwise , the grand canonical expression breaks down , which defines a critical point @xmath142 the failure of the grand canonical ensemble is due to the appearance of an infinite cluster , i.e. of size @xmath143 where @xmath144 is nonzero even as @xmath1 tends to infinity .",
    "more specifically , when @xmath145 exceeds @xmath146 , an infinite cluster exists , absorbing enough mass so that the remaining mass is distributed grand canonically with @xmath137 . if @xmath145 is less that @xmath146 , an infinite cluster does not exist .",
    "as we have already seen , the multiplicity and its fluctuations play an important role in the thermodynamic functions .",
