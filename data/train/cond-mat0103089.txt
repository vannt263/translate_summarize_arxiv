    "the low - lying eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) have been found by kopnin and salomaa  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "this result should be compared with the spectrum of the vortex core in a @xmath65-wave superconductor  @xcite : @xmath66    the common feature of the spectra in the @xmath65-wave and @xmath0-wave cases is the symmetry with respect to zero energy . if we interpret holes in the negative - energy levels as excitations with positive energies ( and with opposite spin )",
    ", then this symmetry implies that the excitations are doubly degenerate in spin : to each spin - up excitation there corresponds a spin - down excitation at the same energy . for the @xmath65-wave vortex , this degeneracy is due to the full spin - rotation @xmath67 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0-wave hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has a reduced spin symmetry .",
    "namely , it has the symmetry group @xmath68 generated by rotations about the @xmath69-axis ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) and by the spin flip @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "this non - abelian group causes the two - fold degeneracy of all levels , except for the zero - energy level(s ) where the symmetry @xmath68 may mix the creation and annihilation operators for the same state .",
    "this symmetry is crucial for our discussion .",
    "note that we have not included in the hamiltonian neither the spin - orbit term @xmath74)$ ] , nor the zeeman splitting @xmath75 .",
    "either of these terms would break the spin symmetry @xmath68 , which would eventually result in a different universality class of the disordered system ( type @xmath2 with non - degenerate levels ) , if these terms are sufficiently strong .",
    "the difference between the @xmath65- and @xmath0-wave vortices is the zero - energy level in the @xmath0-wave case .",
    "it has been shown by volovik that this level has a topological nature  @xcite . indeed , suppose we gradually increase disorder in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . the levels shift and mix , but",
    "the degeneracy of the levels remains the same as long as the symmetry @xmath68 is preserved .",
    "the total number of levels remains _ odd _ , and therefore the zero - energy level _ can not shift _ if the final hamiltonian is a continuous deformation of the original one ( without disorder ) , i.e. if the topological class of the boundary conditions ( [ boundary - conditions ] ) remains the same .",
    "now we can identify the symmetry class of the bogoliubov ",
    "degennes hamiltonian .",
    "the only symmetry of the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is the spin symmetry @xmath68 .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry is already broken by the vortex and by the pairing , and therefore neither the vector potential @xmath76 nor local deformations of @xmath57 can reduce the symmetry of the hamiltonian . when projected onto spin - up excitations @xmath77 d^2 { { \\mathbf r}}$ ] , the bogoliubov ",
    "degennes hamiltonian for the two - component vector @xmath78 takes the form : @xmath79 & \\left[{\\delta_x\\over k_f}*(-{i}\\nabla_x)+ { \\delta_y\\over k_f}*(-{i}\\nabla_y)\\right ] \\cr \\left[{\\delta^*_x\\over k_f}*(-{i}\\nabla_x)+ { \\delta^*_y\\over k_f}*(-{i}\\nabla_y)\\right ] & - \\left [ { ( -{i}\\nabla + e { { \\mathbf a}})^2 \\over 2 m } + v({{\\mathbf r } } )   -\\varepsilon_f \\right ] } \\ ; . \\label{bdgequation}\\ ] ] in an arbitrary orthonormal basis of electronic states , this hamiltonian may be written as a matrix @xmath80 from the hermiticity of the hamiltonian , it follows that @xmath81 . from the explicit form of the @xmath0-wave pairing , @xmath82",
    "( it is here that the @xmath0-wave structure of the pairing is important ; for @xmath65-wave pairing we would have @xmath83 instead ) .",
    "these are the only restrictions on the hamiltonian ( [ ham - short ] ) .",
    "if we define @xmath84 the restrictions on the hamiltonian ( [ ham - short ] ) are equivalent to the condition that the rotated matrix @xmath85 is real antisymmetric , i.e. it belongs to the lie algebra @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the dimension of the hilbert space ( the same rotation of the hamiltonian was used in  @xcite to identify the @xmath2 universality class ) .",
    "the last step in our argument is to note that , under the vortex boundary conditions , the dimension of the hamiltonian ( [ ham - short ] ) is odd , not even ( this may be difficult to visualize from the particle - hole representation ( [ ham - short ] ) , but easier from the rotated hamiltonian @xmath88 ) .",
    "thus for a single - quantum vortex , we identify the space of the hamiltonians as @xmath3 ( class @xmath1 in cartan s notation , see table  1 ) .",
    "now let us consider a slightly different order parameter : suppose that the condensate wave function is described by the same expression ( [ a - phase ] ) , but now the vector @xmath42 is able to rotate ( either in plane or in all three dimensions ) .",
    "the order parameter does not change under simultaneous change of sign of the vector @xmath42 and phase shift by @xmath89 of the phase @xmath90 : @xmath91 .",
    "this makes possible a half - quantum vortex with magnetic flux @xmath92  @xcite . on going around such a vortex , both the vector @xmath42 and the phase @xmath90 rotate by @xmath89 ( fig .  [ fig1]a ) ( see also discussion of such vortices in  @xcite ) .    .",

    "then the condensate wave function ( [ a - phase ] ) is the sum of two decoupled components containing @xmath96 and @xmath97 pairings : @xmath98 ( k_x + { i}k_y)\\ ] ] [ here @xmath60 and @xmath93 are the polar coordinates ] . in a half - quantum vortex , one of the pairing components @xmath99 and @xmath100 has an odd winding number of the phase around the vortex , while the other has an even winding number of the phase . in the simplest vortex of this type ,",
    "the even winding number is zero , the corresponding component of the order parameter is nearly uniform and does not produce states near fermi energy .",
    "the component with an odd winding number ( without loss of generality , let it be @xmath99 , and the winding number be one ) has vortex boundary conditions .",
    "the mean - field hamiltonian decouples and the vortex part of the hamiltonian ( spin - up sector ) takes the form [ we have also assumed an axially symmetric order parameter ] : @xmath101\\ ; .",
    "\\label{ham - halfquantum}\\ ] ] in this form the half - quantum vortex is equivalent to a single - quantum vortex in a superconductor of spinless fermions ( such a superconductor must have odd pairing ) .",
    "the quasiparticles do not have a definite spin projection , but mix particles and holes in the same spin - up sector : @xmath102 { d}^2 { { \\mathbf r}}$ ] . the bogoliubov  degennes equations for @xmath103 and @xmath104 turn out to be identical to those for a single - quantum vortex ( [ bdgequation ] ) , and the solution of kopnin and salomaa  @xcite is equally applicable to this half - quantum vortex resulting in the same spectrum ( [ p - spectrum ] ) .",
    "however , because of the relation @xmath105 , the number of subgap states in the half - quantum vortex is one half of those in a single - quantum vortex : particles in negative - energy levels are identical to holes in positive - energy levels .",
    "the zero - energy state is a majorana fermion  @xcite .",
    "now add a disorder term to the hamiltonian of a clean vortex ( [ ham - halfquantum ] ) .",
    "consider the following perturbations :    * potential scattering : @xmath106 , * zeeman field : @xmath107 , * vector potential : @xmath108 , * spin - orbit scattering : @xmath109 \\right )   \\psi_\\beta$ ] , * deformation of order parameter : + @xmath110    we assume that the perturbation may be switched on adiabatically in such a way that subgap levels stay localized .",
    "one possible way to fulfill this condition is to require that the perturbation is introduced only in a finite region around the vortex core .",
    "the symmetry classification proceeds slightly differently depending on whether the perturbation preserves the decoupling of the hamiltonian into spin - up and spin - down sectors .",
    "the hamiltonian remains decoupled under the perturbations @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 with @xmath114 , @xmath115 with @xmath116 , and @xmath117 with diagonal @xmath118 . with these perturbations ,",
    "the `` spin - up '' sector of the hamiltonian in the basis @xmath78 preserves its form ( [ ham - short ] ) with the same symmetries as for a single - flux vortex . the symmetry class of the hamiltonian is therefore identified as @xmath3 ( class @xmath1 ) .",
    "if other perturbations are present , so that the hamiltonian no longer splits into `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' parts , the full matrix of the hamiltonian needs to be considered . without any spin structure ,",
    "the hamiltonian breaking time - reversal and spin symmetries belongs to the @xmath86 symmetry class , as shown by altland and zirnbauer  @xcite .",
    "their argument also works in our case , with the reservation that the number of levels @xmath87 is odd ( with each level counted twice : once as a particle and the other time as a hole ) .",
    "it follows from the usual continuity consideration ( the majorana fermion at zero energy survives any local perturbation ) .",
    "therefore the symmetry class is again @xmath3 ( class @xmath1 ) .",
    "[ in the examples considered by altland and zirnbauer , the number of levels was even , which lead to the symmetry class @xmath2 or @xmath119 .",
    "it is important however , that to reach the rmt limit in the latter case , such a system must have sufficiently strong disorder to bring the quasiparticles from the `` spin - down '' sector ( gapped in the clean vortex ) to the fermi energy and to mix them strongly with the quasiparticles in the `` spin - up '' sector . in the present paper",
    ", we do not discuss conditions for reaching this limit .",
    "in this section we consider a hypothetical phase of a triplet superconductor analogous to the phase @xmath1 of @xmath40he .",
    "namely , the condensate wave function is assumed to be @xmath120\\ ; , \\qquad { { \\mathbf d}}({{\\mathbf k}})=r_{\\theta}({{\\mathbf k}})\\ ; , \\label{b - phase}\\ ] ] and @xmath121 is a rotation in the plane by angle @xmath93 ( like in the previous sections , we consider a two - dimensional problem , and @xmath122 is a two - dimensional vector ) . in this phase , the vector @xmath42 rotates a full turn as the vector @xmath122 goes around the circular fermi surface .",
    "the parameter @xmath93 denotes the angle between vectors @xmath122 and @xmath42 .",
    "we neglect spin - orbit interactions and assume that all values of @xmath93 are allowed .",
    "it is important that this phase preserves the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "moreover , a vortex structure is possible without time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "it is realized by rotating the angle @xmath93 a full turn of @xmath123 when going around the vortex center and keeping the phase @xmath90 constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "this vortex preserves the time - reversal symmetry and is a topological defect in the spin structure of the triplet pairing , thus we shall call it `` spin vortex '' .",
    "the hamiltonian of the clean axially symmetric spin vortex splits into `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' sectors , similarly to the case of the half - quantum vortex considered in the previous section . in the spin vortex , both the `` spin - up '' and the `` spin - down '' components have vortex structure .",
    "the `` spin - up '' hamiltonian is identical to the hamiltonian @xmath124 of ( [ ham - halfquantum ] ) , while the `` spin - down '' component is its complex conjugate @xmath125 ( with spin reversed )  or vice versa .    in a clean spin vortex , the spectrum of each of the two vortices ( in the `` spin - up '' and the `` spin down '' sectors ) are identical to that in the half - quantum vortex of the previous section , and",
    "therefore the total spectrum coincides with that of the single - flux vortex of section  i ( with the two majorana fermions combining into a single zero - energy level ) .",
    "in contrast to the single - quantum vortex , it is now not the spin symmetry which is responsible for the double degeneracy of the levels with non - zero energy , but the time - reversal symmetry ( the degeneracy is due to kramers theorem ) .",
    "now suppose that the hamiltonian is perturbed by a disorder term preserving the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the allowed perturbations include potential scattering @xmath111 , spin - orbit scattering @xmath115 , as well as deformation of the order parameter @xmath117 in a time - reversal invariant way .",
    "then the levels with non - zero energy stay doubly degenerate , and the zero - energy level can not shift ( because it is non - degenerate ) .",
    "the symmetry class of the perturbed hamiltonian may be identified from the argument of altland and zirnbauer as @xmath2iii ( time - reversal symmetry present , spin symmetry broken )  @xcite . in the @xmath0-wave vortex ,",
    "the number of subgap levels is odd , and therefore the symmetry class is @xmath2iii - odd , in contrast to class @xmath2iii - even studied by altland and zirnbauer [ similarly to distinguishing between classes @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we find it useful to distinguish between classes @xmath2iii - even and @xmath2iii - odd : they have different parameters @xmath11 , as a consequence of the zero - energy level in odd dimensions ] .",
    "in this section we discuss whether the rmt limit may be realized in disordered vortices .",
    "we suppose that the superconductor contains a finite concentration @xmath126 of spinless impurities with strong electron scattering ( born parameter is of order one ) . then the effect of impurities is dual",
    ": they directly contribute a potential term @xmath111 in the hamiltonian and they also suppress the superconducting order parameter thus inducing an inhomogeneous pairing perturbation @xmath117 .",
    "we shall see that the latter effect has a much stronger influence on shifting the energy levels of the subgap states .",
    "consider first the potential term @xmath111 with the impurity potential @xmath127 .",
    "the matrix element of the impurity potential between the two localized states is equal to @xmath128 from explicitly solving bogoliubov ",
    "degennes equations for a clean @xmath0-wave vortex  @xcite , one finds that @xmath129 and @xmath130 are proportional to each other , to the leading order in @xmath131 ( where @xmath132 is the energy of the @xmath133-th level )",
    ". therefore the matrix element @xmath134 between any two low - lying states nearly vanishes ( this was noticed by volovik in  @xcite ) .",
    "a more accurate calculation shows that matrix elements of the charge density between states at energy @xmath35 is of the order of @xmath135 , which is by the factor @xmath136 smaller than that in the @xmath65-wave vortex . as a consequence , even for strong impurities ( with @xmath137 ) , an extremely high impurity concentration ( @xmath138 ) is required to mix low - energy levels  a much higher disorder than that destroying @xmath0-wave superconductivity ( @xmath139 )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a uniformly disordered @xmath0-wave superconductor , the @xmath111 term is insufficient for the rmt regime in the vortex core .",
    "the suppression of the order parameter @xmath117 turns out to be a more important effect . in unconventional superconductors ,",
    "spinless impurities suppress pairing in the region of size @xmath140 which is of the same order as the size of the vortex core . for a homogeneous order parameter ( without vortex ) ,",
    "the suppression of the order parameter @xmath141 decreases as @xmath142 ( in our two - dimensional problem ) at distances up to @xmath140 , and is negligible at distances much larger than @xmath140  @xcite , and the integral suppression may be estimated as @xmath143 .",
    "also , in a chiral superconductor , the component of the order parameter of opposite chirality is admixed in the vicinity of impurity  @xcite .",
    "the two effects gives comparable contributions to the matrix elements between subgap states .",
    "an accurate calculation of the impurity influence on the states in the vortex core requires a full self - consistent solution for the order parameter taking into account both the vortex and the impurities .",
    "this goes beyond the scope of this paper , and we only estimate the order of magnitude of the corresponding matrix elements .",
    "the deformation of the order parameter @xmath117 has the matrix elements between subgap states @xmath144 and @xmath133 : @xmath145 u_n({{\\mathbf r } } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + v_m^*({{\\mathbf r } } ) \\left[\\delta{\\delta^{(\\alpha)}}^*({{\\mathbf r } } ) * ( { i}\\nabla_\\alpha)\\right ] v_n({{\\mathbf r } } ) \\bigg)\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unlike the case of the matrix elements of @xmath111 , there is no cancellation in @xmath146 , and we may estimate , for one impurity in the vortex core @xmath147 thus , a single impurity introduces matrix elements of the order of interlevel spacing .",
    "these estimates suggest that the rmt regime may be achieved when the number of impurities in the vortex core is much greater than one ( which corresponds to the moderately clean regime @xmath148 ) .",
    "we have shown that symmetries of vortex hamiltonians in @xmath0-wave superconductors correspond to one of the two random - matrix ensembles : @xmath1 or @xmath2iii - odd .",
    "these two rmt ensembles are distinguished from the rest of ensembles by the presence of zero - energy modes ( zero - energy modes are also present in chiral ensembles at @xmath149 , see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "zero - energy levels appear in @xmath0-wave vortices as a consequence of odd pairing symmetry combined with the vortex ( topologically nontrivial ) boundary conditions .",
    "we have checked the symmetries of the hamiltonian explicitly taking three vortices as examples : a single - quantum vortex with spin symmetry , a half - quantum vortex , and a flux - less ( spin ) vortex without time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "based on these examples , we may conjecture that classes @xmath1 and @xmath2iii - odd appear in any vortex - like structure with odd pairing , whenever a zero - energy mode is present . in cases with time reversal symmetry",
    ", the vortex belongs to the class @xmath2iii - odd ; when the time - reversal symmetry is broken  to the class @xmath1 . of course",
    ", this can also be checked explicitly in any particular case .",
    "the two classes @xmath1 and @xmath2iii - odd considered in this paper are odd - dimensional counterparts of the classes @xmath2 and @xmath2iii - even , respectively ( see table  1 ) , with the even - dimensional classes realized in conventional ( singlet - pairing ) normal - superconducting structures  @xcite .",
    "far from zero energy , the statistics of energy levels is not affected by the zero mode . in the immediate vicinity of zero energy ,",
    "repulsion from the zero mode in classes @xmath1 and @xmath2iii - odd increases the exponent @xmath11 ( see table  1 ) , suppressing the average density of states @xmath150 as @xmath151 for class @xmath1 , and @xmath152 for class @xmath2iii - odd .    because of the zero modes , the classes @xmath1 and @xmath2iii - odd stand somewhat separately from the rest of rmt ensembles .",
    "in particular , they do not appear in the table of correspondence between symmetries of the hamiltonian and those of the transfer matrix  @xcite ( for rmt ensembles without zero - energy levels , this table establishes a one - to - one correspondence ) .",
    "neither these two ensembles are known to be derived from a supersymmetric sigma - model as other classes are  @xcite .",
    "understanding the latter fact remains an interesting problem , as well as a possible microscopic derivation of the random - matrix theory for @xmath0-wave vortices with the supersymmetric method , analogously to that for the @xmath65-wave vortex  @xcite .",
    "several more comments can be made on comparing our results to the level statistics in @xmath65-wave vortices .",
    "the latter is known to belong to the symmetry class @xmath7  @xcite having spin - rotational symmetry and broken time - reversal symmetry  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the @xmath67 spin symmetry in conventional superconductors , the single - quantum vortex considered in our paper has the @xmath68 spin symmetry instead , which leads to a somewhat different symmetry classification . the resulting symmetry is @xmath153 , which leads to classes @xmath2 ( in even dimensions , no vortex ) or @xmath1 ( odd dimensions , vortex with zero mode ) .",
    "the joint probability distributions of the energy levels ( [ probability - alpha - beta ] ) for classes @xmath1 ( @xmath0-wave vortex ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath65-wave vortex ) coincide ( with @xmath154 ) , and only the zero - energy level distinguishes the two ensembles . in particular , the average density of states in the class @xmath1 random - matrix ensemble is @xmath155 ( for class @xmath7 it is the same but without the @xmath156 term ) .    in @xmath65-wave vortices , koulakov and",
    "larkin found that in a wide range of impurity concentrations , the level mixing does not lead to a class @xmath7 , but has more symmetries  @xcite .",
    "these symmetries arise from the fact that the impurities are local scatterers in a chiral quasi - one - dimensional two - channel system , resulting in an ensemble of @xmath157 random matrices , instead of @xmath158 matrices with large @xmath12 .",
    "such effect seems improbable in @xmath0-wave vortices where the main contribution to level mixing comes from the distortion of the order parameter around impurities which is extended in space to distances of the order of the core size . in this paper",
    "we performed only an order - of - magnitude estimate suggesting that the rmt limit may be reached in moderately clean vortices ( with the number of impurities per vortex core much greater than one ) .",
    "a more accurate self - consistent treatment of impurities in the vortex core is required for a quantitative study of the effects of disorder .",
