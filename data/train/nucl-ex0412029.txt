    "nuclear level densities and radiative strength functions are important inputs for calculations of nuclear reaction cross sections .",
    "in addition to their value in practical applications , these average quantities may shed light on the understanding of such fundamental issues as the transition from the discrete ( low excitation ) to statistical ( high excitation ) regime . at low excitation energy",
    ", the level density is obtained directly by counting low - lying levels . however , at increasing excitation energy , the level density becomes large and individual levels are often not resolved in experiments@xcite .",
    "nuclear resonances at or above the nucleon binding energy provide another source of level density data @xcite . between these two excitation energy regions ,",
    "relatively little is known about nuclear level densities .",
    "the present paper focuses on this intermediate region .",
    "a major part of the information on radiative strength functions comes from photoabsorption cross section measurements @xcite .",
    "high energy @xmath10 transitions ( @xmath11 mev ) are dominated by the giant electric dipole resonance ( gedr ) . although the electric dipole transition strengths are well studied in the vicinity of the gedr , the behavior of low energy @xmath10 rays is less well understood @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true for radiative transitions between highly excited states .",
    "experimental data on the @xmath12 strength function are much scarcer than for the @xmath13 strength function . in these regions , an experimental technique recently developed by the oslo cyclotron group provides valuable data .",
    "this method allows one to determine level densities and radiative strength functions simultaneously @xcite from the primary @xmath10-ray spectra .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it provides data on nuclear level densities and radiative strength functions in regions where there is little information and data is difficult to obtain .",
    "however , the level density and radiative strength function are coupled , since the @xmath10 decay input to the technique depends on both quantities .",
    "a shortcoming of the method is that the absolute level density and radiative strength function need to be normalized using the low - lying discrete states , neutron resonance spacings , and average total radiative widths of neutron resonances .",
    "thus the primary new contribution is the energy dependence of the level density and the radiative strength function .",
    "this method is commonly referred to as the oslo method .",
    "it has been shown to work well in heavy - mass nuclei and has been extended to other mass regions as well @xcite .",
    "the present paper reports new results from a @xmath0yb + @xmath2he experiment . the oslo method and the experimental set - up",
    "are briefly discussed , followed by a brief description of level densities and radiative strength functions .",
    "the results for @xmath0yb obtained from two different reactions , @xmath0yb(@xmath2he,@xmath2he@xmath14)@xmath0yb and @xmath5yb(@xmath2he,@xmath9)@xmath0yb , are compared . the similar comparison for @xmath5yb , previously reported ,",
    "is repeated for the sake of completeness .",
    "the experiment was conducted at the oslo cyclotron laboratory ( ocl ) using a 45-mev @xmath2he beam .",

    "particle-@xmath10 coincidences for @xmath6yb were detected using the cactus multidetector array @xcite .",
    "the charged particles were measured with eight si particle telescopes placed at 45@xmath20 with respect to the beam direction .",
    "each telescope consists of a front si @xmath21 detector and a back si(li ) @xmath22 detector with thicknesses 140 and 3000 @xmath23 m , respectively .",
    "an array of 28 collimated nai @xmath10-ray detectors with a total coverage of @xmath16 15% of 4@xmath24 surrounds the target .",
    "in addition one to three ge detectors were used to estimate the spin distribution and determine the selectivity of the reaction .",
    "the typical spin range is expected to be @xmath25 .",
    "experiments run for @xmath16 2 weeks with typical beam currents of @xmath16 1.5 na .",
    "the data analysis consists of three main steps .",
    "the first step is to prepare the particle-@xmath10 coincidence matrix . for each particle energy bin",
    "total cascade @xmath10-ray spectra are obtained from the coincidence measurement .",
    "the particle energy is transformed to excitation energy using the reaction kinematics .",
    "then each row of the coincidence matrix corresponds to a certain excitation energy @xmath26 in the residual nucleus , while each column corresponds to a certain @xmath10-ray energy @xmath27 .",
    "the second step is the unfolding .",
    "the @xmath10-ray spectrum is unfolded using the known response function of the cactus array @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10-ray spectrum containing only the first @xmath10 rays emitted from a given excitation energy is called the first - generation spectrum and denoted by @xmath28 . the matrix which consists of first generation spectra",
    "is obtained in the third step for each excitation energy bin using the subtraction procedure described in ref .",
    "the key assumption of this method is that the @xmath10 decay from any excitation energy bin is independent of the method of formation , either directly by the nuclear reaction or by @xmath10 decay from higher lying states following the initial reaction .",
    "this assumption is automatically fulfilled when the same states are populated equally via the two processes , since @xmath10 branching ratios are properties of levels . even if different states are populated",
    ", the assumption is still valid for statistical @xmath10 decay , which depends only on the @xmath10-ray energy and the number of available final states .",
    "these assumptions have been investigated extensively over the years by the oslo group and shown to work reasonably well @xcite .",
    "the entries of the first generation matrix @xmath28 are the probabilities @xmath29 that a @xmath10-ray of energy @xmath27 is emitted from excitation energy @xmath26 .",
    "the probability of @xmath10 decay is proportional to the product of the @xmath10-ray strength ( i.e. , the radiative transmission coefficient @xmath30 ) and the level density @xmath31 at the final energy @xmath32 @xmath33 this factorization is the generalized form of the brink - axel hypothesis @xcite which states that the gedr and any other excitation modes built on an excited state have the same properties as those built on the ground state . in other words ,",
    "the radiative transition strength is independent of the excitation energy .",
    "there is evidence that the width of the giant - dipole resonance increases with increasing nuclear temperature of the state upon which it is built , and thus with its excitation energy @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the temperature that corresponds to the excitation energy region covered in this work is rather low and changes slowly with excitation energy ( @xmath35 ) . in this work",
    "we assume constant temperature and that the radiative strength function does not depend on the excitation energy in the energy interval under consideration .    in the oslo method the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 are determined by an iterative procedure @xcite .",
    "the goal of the iteration is to determine these two functions at @xmath38 energy values each ; the product of the two functions is known at @xmath39 data points .",
    "the globalized fitting to the data points determines the functional form for @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "however , it can be shown that the entries of matrix @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ probab ] ) given by the product of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are invariant under the transformation @xcite",

    "e_\\gamma ) { \\cal t}(e_\\gamma ) .",
    "\\label{eq : array2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , in a final step , the transformation parameters @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath9 , which correspond to the physical solution have to be determined .",
    "the level density @xmath36 is determined from the nuclear ground state up to @xmath431 mev , where @xmath44 is the neutron binding energy .",
    "the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath9 are determined from the normalization of the level density to data from the discrete levels and the neutron resonance spacings .",
    "the radiative transmission coefficient @xmath37 is obtained from @xmath45 1 mev to around @xmath44 .",
    "the remaining constant @xmath42 is determined from the normalization of the transmission coefficient to data from the total radiative widths of neutron resonances .",
    "the details of the normalization and consideration of the experimental results are discussed in the following sections .",
    "the level density obtained from the present experiment covers the excitation energy from the ground state up to @xmath431 mev .",
    "however , as described in the previous section , the level density must be normalized .",
    "figure [ counting170yb ] illustrates the normalization procedure .",
    "the filled circles are our experimental data points for the reaction @xmath0yb@xmath46he,@xmath47yb . in the upper panel , the level density at low excitation energy determined from the present experimental data is compared to the histogram calculated using discrete levels listed in the table of isotopes @xcite .",
    "the agreement is good up to @xmath48 1.6  mev . above this energy",
    "the two results differ because there is limited information on discrete levels at higher excitation energy .",
    "thus , the present experiment provides new results for the average level density above @xmath49 1.6 mev .",
    "comparison at low excitation energy is used to fix the absolute value of the data at the low - energy end . in the lower panel , the normalization with respect to the neutron resonance spacing data is shown .",
    "the level density at @xmath44 is determined using the neutron resonance spacing data @xcite .",
    "since our data only extend to @xmath16 1  mev below @xmath44 , an interpolation is required between the present experimental data and @xmath36 evaluated at @xmath44 . the back - shifted fermi gas level density parameterized by von egidy _",
    "@xcite , @xmath50 is employed for the interpolation . the back - shifted excitation energy is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52  mev , @xmath53  mev@xmath54 and the pairing parameter @xmath55 is estimated following the prescription by dobaczewski",
    "_ @xcite . for @xmath5yb ,",
    "a slightly different normalization was used .",
    "the level density for @xmath1yb is about an order of magnitude smaller than the level density for @xmath0yb .",
    "we report new results for the level density and radiative strength function obtained from reactions on the target nucleus @xmath0yb . for @xmath0yb ,",
    "the level density and radiative strength function were obtained by two different reactions , one from the @xmath0yb@xmath46he,@xmath2he@xmath56yb reaction and another from the @xmath5yb@xmath46he,@xmath57yb reaction .",
    "the results from the @xmath5yb(@xmath2he,@xmath4)@xmath0yb experiment were reported previously in @xcite .",
    "similarly , the level density in @xmath5yb is obtained by two reactions .",
    "figure [ rhoall ] shows the level densities of @xmath6yb from the ground state up to @xmath43 1 mev .",
    "data points shown in full circles are from the ( @xmath2he,@xmath4 ) reaction and in open circles from the ( @xmath2he,@xmath2he@xmath3 ) reaction .",
    "the effect which yields an overestimated level density at low excitation @xmath16 0.5  mev from @xmath46he,@xmath2he@xmath58 reaction data is due to a disporportional population of states with relatively large transition matrix elements to the ground state rotational band .",
    "more details on this effect are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . except for this effect",
    ", the agreement between level densities for the same nucleus obtained via two different reactions is excellent .",
    "the level density is closely connected to the entropy @xmath59 of the system at a given excitation energy @xmath26 .",
    "this opens the possibility of investigating certain thermodynamic properties in the atomic nucleus .",
    "the entropy is given by @xmath60 the boltzmann s constant @xmath8 is set to unity from here on .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath61 is directly proportional to the level density : @xmath62 .",
    "the ground states of even - even nuclei represents a well - ordered system with no thermal excitations and are characterized by zero entropy and temperature . therefore the normalization denominator is set to @xmath63 mev@xmath54 to obtain @xmath64 in the ground state band region .",
    "this ensures that the ground band properties fulfill the third law of thermodynamics with @xmath65 .",
    "the extracted @xmath66 is also used for the odd - mass neighboring nuclei .    figure [ ybentr ]",
    "shows the entropies @xmath59 of @xmath6yb obtained from the ( @xmath2he,@xmath4 ) reaction .",
    "several properties derived from this figure are actually connected to the fact that these mid - shell rare earth nuclei have similar nuclear structure and global properties , such as nuclear deformation .",
    "the entropies ( or level densities ) of @xmath1yb and @xmath5yb follow each other closely as a function of excitation energy .",
    "in particular , in the excitation energy region from the ground state up to 2 mev , @xmath67 shows very similar shapes .",
    "we interpret the strong increase around 1.5 mev of excitation energy as the breaking of the first cooper pair .",
    "the next increase , which is much more smeared out , terminates near 2.5 mev and reveals the beginning of the four quasiparticle regime . above 2.5 mev",
    "the entropy increases linearly @xcite .",
    "in addition , all three entropy curves are parallel for excitation energies above @xmath68 mev . in the microcanonical ensemble",
    ", the slope of @xmath67 is connected to the temperature by @xmath69 a constant temperature least - square fit in the @xmath70 mev region of @xmath6yb gives @xmath71 and @xmath72 mev , respectively .",
    "these temperatures are interpreted as the critical temperatures @xmath73 for the breaking of nucleon pairs .",
    "it is interesting to note that the entropy of @xmath0yb shows a strongly increasing behavior that also terminates at @xmath74 mev revealing the first breaking of cooper pairs in the underlying even - even core . here",
    "the odd valence nucleon behaves as a passive spectator , however , the increase in @xmath67 appears at slightly lower excitation energies than for the even systems .",
    "this behavior is attributed to the reduced pairing gap @xmath55 resulting from the pauli blocking by the valence neutron in the odd system .",
    "the entropy carried by the valence neutron particle ( or hole ) can be estimated assuming that the entropy is an extensive ( additive ) quantity @xcite .",
    "figure [ ybdsn ] shows the observed single particle and hole entropies defined by @xmath75 respectively .",
    "the single particle ( or hole ) carries about @xmath76 .",
    "deviations from this estimate appear at low excitation energies due to the lower pairing gap in the odd - mass system . at higher energies",
    "the slightly lower critical temperature in the odd - mass system is responsible for the increasing entropy difference as function of excitation energy .",
    "these two qualitative explanations are connected .",
    "the pairing gap @xmath55 , critical temperature @xmath73 and single particle ( hole ) entropy @xmath77 are related @xcite by @xmath78 for constant @xmath77 .",
    "this is consistent with the present observations .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect that if both @xmath55 and @xmath73 were equal in the systems compared , the @xmath79 curve would be flatter as function of excitation energy .    the thermodynamical properties can also be studied using the canonical ensemble .",
    "recently @xcite this was performed for the @xmath80dy isotopes that behave very much in the same way as the present yb isotopes .",

    "the average radiative width of neutron resonances @xmath85 at the neutron binding energy is related to @xmath81 @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the average spacing of @xmath88-wave neutron resonances , and the sum extends over all possible final state spins and parities , and matching multipole contribution to @xmath89 .",
    "the level density is assumed to have the standard energy and spin dependent parts @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the spin cut - off parameter , and we assume equal number of positive and negative parity states .",
