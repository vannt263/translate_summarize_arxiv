    "@xcite ) argued that a large number of samples give strong evidence that the distribution of clusters and galaxies is a simple fractal of dimension @xmath11 , supported by the same authors in the past years ( coleman & pietronero @xcite ) , and @xmath10 has been often discussed in the literature , because it would naturally arise _ locally _ from a geometrical dominance of planar structures , such as `` pancakes '' , see f.i .",
    "guzzo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) . ] on scales of several hundreds of mpc , quite different from the `` canonical '' value of @xmath12 .",
    "this is an important claim because of its far reaching implications , and this issue , which dates back to the beginning of the century ( charlier , 1908 , see peebles @xcite ) , can be properly addressed with long and careful analyses which , however , demand much deeper and better samples than those presently available in order to be able to explore an adequate range of scales ( see e.g. mc  cauley @xcite , hamburger et al .",
    "while 2d constraints come from fluctuations in cosmic backgrounds ( see e.g. peebles 1993 ) , historically much work on this subject has been done for decades in analyzing galaxy counts which , in a non evolving euclidean universe , should follow @xmath13 .",
    "indeed , this behaviour has been observed in an intermediate magnitude range , @xmath14 , ( see e.g. sandage @xcite ) .",
    "however , on the bright side one has to deal with magnitude errors given from saturation of photographic plates and/or the relatively small volumes sampled which also reflect in uncertainties in locally the derived space galaxy density ( cf loveday et al .",
    "@xcite , zucca et al .",
    "1997 , maddox @xcite ) , while on the faint side cosmological curvature and evolutionary effects become dominant and difficult to disentangle ( koo & kron @xcite , ellis @xcite ) .",
    "therefore one really needs redshift information in order to avoid effects of time  space projections .    in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to an independent check on two of the samples discussed by p&c , the esp galaxies ( vettolani et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the aco clusters ( abell , corwin & olowin @xcite ) , without touching upon the very general issue of a possible fractal distribution of the matter in the universe and its consequences : the interested reader can consult peebles ( @xcite ) , coleman & pietronero ( @xcite ) , stoeger et al .",

    "however , if the evidence were present in the data at the highly significant level claimed by p&c , the simple analysis presented here should be more than adequate in confirming the @xmath10 claims .    in section 1 we present the formalism , in section 2 the results from esp galaxies , in section 3 the results from the aco clusters , and finally in section 4 the conclusions .",
    "in a previous discussion ( scaramella et al .",
    "@xcite ) on the origin of the local group velocity with respect to the cosmic microwave background frame , it was pointed out the relevance of the depth s behaviour of clusters `` monopole '' and `` dipole '' with respect to the issue of approach to homogeneity of the matter distribution ( see sylos labini @xcite for contrasting views ) .",
    "the method , adopted also by p&c , is very simple : basically , after selecting a volume limited sample of objects , one considers the quantity @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the radial distances of the objects in the sample and @xmath17 is the dirac distribution .",
    "now , for a simple fractal of dimension @xmath18 one has @xmath19 one should notice an important difference between the two above expressions : while eq .",
    "[ eq : monop ] refers to a _",
    "single point _ ( the origin ) , eq .",
    "[ eq : frac ] refers to a statistical property of the sample , i.e. is obtained by averaging on all points of the sample ( for which several methods have been discussed in the literature ) .",
    "however , also according to p&c , for samples with an adequate number of objects even with eq .",
    "[ eq : monop ] one should recover , after some initial fluctuations ( sylos labini et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the `` correct '' dependence on distance of eq .",
    "[ eq : frac ] for a fractal distribution , that is @xmath20 .",
    "therefore p&c considered an expression equivalent to eq .",
    "[ eq : monop ] , the integral density @xmath21 , and derived the value @xmath11 from preliminary esp data up to depths of several hundreds of mpc .",
    "the esp final sample of galaxies ( vettolani et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 ) , limited in apparent magnitude in the @xmath22 band ( @xmath23 ) , is highly complete in the fraction of measured redshifts ( @xmath24 ) . despite",
    "this fact , its analysis in terms of volume  limited subsamples is not entirely trivial .",
    "the results are somewhat dependent on the assumptions on the cosmological parameters , and some uncertainty is induced by the statistical error on the observed magnitudes ( r.m.s . of @xmath25 mags ) and the uncertainties in the adopted k - corrections .    in our analysis",
    "we will use the standard formula to derive the absolute magnitude : @xmath26 +   \\log ( h ) \\right\\ } -k(z ) \\label{eq : b}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the k",
    " correction term ( discussed below ) , @xmath28 is the luminosity distance in mpc ( we assume @xmath29 @xmath30@xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) ; henceforth we will drop the @xmath35 subscript from the magnitudes .    we will consider esp volume limited subsamples obtained with three cuts in absolute luminosity , namely @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "these limits span increasingly deeper volumes with decreasing statistics .",
    "obviously the limiting distances of the volume limited subsamples are function of the adopted cosmological model and k  correction . in the following",
    "we will consider comoving radial distance : @xmath39 . in the euclidean case we will have @xmath40 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : distlim ] we show the limiting distances for volume  limited subsamples as a function of absolute magnitude for five different cases :    * cosmological distance and average k  correction as in zucca et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; * cosmological distance and k  correction estimated from the spectrum of each galaxy ( fiorani & scaramella @xcite ) ; * euclidean distance and k  correction as in case ( i ) ; * cosmological distance and zero k  correction ; * euclidean distance and zero k  correction .    except for case ( ii )",
    "the adopted k ",
    "correction at any given redshift is the same for all galaxies and in these cases the definition of a volume limited subsample is straightforward . in case ( ii )",
    "we have to limit the depth in such a way to include all morphological types , and therefore we define the limiting distance by using @xmath41 , i.e. the k - correction appropriate for elliptical galaxies in our redshift range , @xmath42 .    for the esp sample p&c claim that the signature of @xmath43 is seen for volume limited sub ",
    "samples at a depth greater than @xmath44  mpc / h , which according to sylos labini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is the minimum depth of statistical validity of the radial analysis for this sample .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : espavgslopes ] the results of fitting @xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ eq : frac ] to the three volume limited subsamples of case ( i ) in the range @xmath45  mpc / h .",
    "the influence of the large inhomogeneity reported in zucca et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is evident in all subsamples up to a depth of @xmath46 mpc / h , but after that _ we find no evidence for a slope @xmath47 _ , as claimed by p&c .    since the data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : espavgslopes ] are cumulative distributions , the points are not independent . therefore in order to have an estimate of the error associated to the fitted value we applied the bootstrap method ( efron & tbishirani @xcite ) , which yields a measure of the _ internal uncertainty _ of the sample at hand .",
    "the bootstrap estimates from 10,000 resamplings have a gaussian shape and yield : @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "these values are all consistent with @xmath12 , while for all of them @xmath10 is at more than five standard deviations .",
    "if we analyze case ( ii ) ( cosmological distance and k  correction estimated from the spectrum of each galaxy ) we obtain values in good agreement with case ( i ) , as reported in table  1 .",
    "if we modify case ( i ) with the use of euclidean distances rather than the comoving ones , we still obtain values which bracket @xmath12 ( case iii ) .",

    "the results for the last case are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : espeuclidslopes ] . since the effect of neglecting the k  correction term in eq .",
    "[ eq : b ] is to assign a lower intrinsic luminosity to each galaxy , the brightest subsample has only @xmath60 galaxies and is dominated by discreteness .",
    "the results of the present analysis show the capital importance of the k  correction term : _ unless one is willing to disregard the physical effect of the redshift on the observed spectrum and intrinsic luminosity _",
    "( and moreover to adopt a purely euclidean metric ) , our results do not support the claims of p&c of a value @xmath10 for the esp survey , but rather suggest the value @xmath61 .",
    "it is worthwhile to stress that the k ",
    "correction is an empirical and necessary correction to the magnitude of a galaxy , and it does not depend on any interpretation of the redshift .",
    "this correction simply takes into account that at different redshifts we are looking at different regions of the galaxy spectrum .",
    "in agreement with several analyses which appeared on the subject ( see e.g. bahcall @xcite and reference therein ) , scaramella et al . (",
    "@xcite ) and zucca et al .",
    "( @xcite ) found that the aco sample suffers from a significant radial incompleteness beyond a depth of @xmath62  mpc / h .",
    "even though the different angular selection functions and overall completeness are different for the northern ( original abell ) and the southern sample , it has been argued ( scaramella et al .",
    "@xcite ) that the radial incompleteness is not very strong within @xmath62  mpc / h . in this case , quite differently from clustering analyses , the angular selection function should impact only on the amplitude but not on the radial behaviour of the scalar quantity @xmath63 .",
    "we will therefore consider aco clusters which have @xmath64 and @xmath65  mpc / h without any correction for angular incompleteness .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : acoslopes ] the results of applying eq .",
    "[ eq : frac ] to the combined north+south sample .",
    "not all the clusters have measured redshift : for those for which a measure of @xmath66 is not available , we have used estimated @xmath66 from relations which have @xmath67 of uncertainty , as reported in the papers above .",
    "we have 268 measured @xmath66 out of 363 for @xmath8 and 481 out of 723 for @xmath9 .",
    "the clusters with estimated redshifts concentrate into the @xmath68  mpc / h region ( within which there is @xmath69 of measured @xmath66 ) and can affect only the last points of figure  [ fig : acoslopes ]    repeating the same fitting as done in the esp case , and estimating similarly the errors on @xmath18 , we obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71 for richness class @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "we draw the conclusion that our analysis excludes @xmath10 with high levels of significance also for clusters , while it favours the canonical value @xmath12 .",
    "on the basis of the present analysis we do not find any evidence in the esp and aco samples for a fractal exponent @xmath74 as claimed by p&c . for the esp sample we showed that @xmath74 can be obtained only by neglecting the k  correction term : in our opinion to neglect this term would be both unphysical and unjustified .",
    "moreover , also the cluster sample , which is not significantly affected by this particular uncertainty , clearly excludes the value @xmath10 .    on the contrary",
    ", we find evidence that within the errors both samples show a behaviour on large scales both consistent with and supporting the canonical value , namely @xmath12 .",
    "it must be stressed that our results use direct depth information differently from indirect arguments such as scaling of angular correlation functions or fluctuations of cosmic backgrounds ( see e.g. peebles @xcite ) .",
    "the above conclusions suggest the need of further and more careful and sophisticated studies on the claims of a strong evidence for a fractal matter distribution from the data sets we analyzed . also further independent checks should be done and possibly on other , better suited samples .",
