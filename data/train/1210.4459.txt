    "we study a wireless system where two adjacent transmitter ( tx )  receiver ( rx ) pairs , or links , operate simultaneously in the same frequency band and interfere with each other .",
    "each tx employs @xmath0 antennas , whereas each rx is equipped with a single antenna .",
    "hence , the system is modeled as the so - called multiple - input single - output ( miso ) interference channel ( ic ) @xcite .",
    "we assume that the txs have perfect knowledge of the local channels to both rxs and use scalar gaussian codes followed by single - stream beamforming .",
    "also , we assume that the rxs are capable to perform successive interference cancellation ( sic ) @xcite .",
    "that is , when the interfering signal is strong enough , we explain what mean by strong enough in the current context . ] , a rx can decode it and subtract it from the received signal before decoding the desired signal .",
    "the decoding is done independently , since the rxs are located apart and there is no coordination amongst them .",
    "sic capability is an important assumption because in principle it leads to higher achievable rates than in case where the rxs treat interference as noise .",
    "note that the sic rate region is a superset of the region achieved when interference is treated as noise , since the latter is a special case of the former .",
    "we see this by noting that the optimal decoding process might be to directly decode the intended signal treating the interference as noise . once the intended signal is decoded , the rxs are not interested in decoding the interference",
    ". the resulting achievable rate region is defined by the so - called pareto boundary , which is the set of points where the rate of one link can not increase without decreasing the rate of the other .",
    "the objective of this paper is to propose computationally efficient methods for finding , in a centralized way , the pareto - optimal ( po ) pairs of beamforming vectors which yield operating points on this pareto boundary .",
    "these methods are important because they enable a fast computation of the rate region .",
    "hence , we can use them to illustrate how different channel realizations affect the shape of the rate region or in the context of large - scale simulation studies of interference networks .",
    "moreover , they provide valuable insight on the beamforming design and inspiration for practical implementations .",
    "the capacity region of the ic is in general unknown , but it is known for certain cases . for strong interference ,",
    "the capacity region coincides with the capacity region for the case where both rxs decode both messages , i.e. , it is the intersection of the capacity regions of two multiple - access channels , see @xcite . for weak interference",
    "it is optimal to treat it as noise , see @xcite for the single - antenna ic and @xcite for the multi - antenna ic . for the miso ic , various achievable rate regions have been proposed and studied , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "especially , the case of treating interference as noise has been the subject of intense studies , e.g. , in @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that single - stream beamforming is optimal for gaussian codes . in @xcite , a parameterization of the po beamforming vectors",
    "was proposed based on the properties that they use full transmit power and lie in the subspace spanned by the local channels .",
    "alternative parameterizations were proposed in @xcite and @xcite , using the concepts of virtual signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) and gain regions , respectively . in @xcite , the rate region for the related scenario of cooperative multicell precoding was characterized .",
    "the parameterizations for the two - user miso ic illustrate that for any number of transmit antennas , it can be reduced to an equivalent miso ic where each tx has two antennas @xcite .",
    "the miso ic with sic - capable rxs was investigated in @xcite where the gain potential of sic over treating interference as noise was illustrated in terms of average rate at a nash equilibrium .",
    "later , in @xcite , the achievable rate region for sic - capable rxs was formalized and in @xcite a parameterization for the po beamforming vectors was proposed , extending the respective result of @xcite .",
    "a related work appears in @xcite , where a simplified version of the han - kobayashi region @xcite was studied and semidefinite relaxation was used to propose power control schemes and compute the corresponding rate region .",
    "the parameterizations in @xcite and @xcite are useful analytical tools and they enable a better intuitive understanding of the properties of the po beamforming vectors .",
    "when the rxs treat interference as noise , the po beamforming vectors are obtained by trading off between the conflicting objectives of maximizing the desired signal power and minimizing the interference @xcite . for sic capable rxs , the trade - off is between maximization of the desired signal power and maximization of the interference , to enable sic @xcite .",
    "another merit of these parameterizations is that they substantially decrease the dimension of the search space for a po beamforming vector , from @xmath1 complex variables to one or two nonnegative real variables .",
    "however , besides the dimensionality reduction , these parameterizations do not directly provide a method for efficient computation of the pareto boundary .",
    "the reason is that they only constitute _ necessary _ conditions that the beamforming vector of each tx has to _ separately _ fulfill , whereas it is _ pairs _ of beamforming vectors that yield po operating points .",
    "the state - of - the - art use of the parameterizations has been to sample the parameters , consider all possible combinations to generate a large number of achievable rate pairs , and perform a brute - force search amongst them to find the ones comprising the pareto boundary , e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to devise a method which directly and efficiently computes po points .",
    "joint optimization of the beamforming vectors is required for this purpose . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the problem of jointly maximizing a common utility function and of finding po points is np - hard in general .",
    "nevertheless , several methods have been recently proposed , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , which apply successive convex optimization techniques on the vector space of the beamforming vectors to find the pareto boundary when the rxs treat interference as noise .",
    "the methods proposed herein achieve much higher computational efficiency by optimizing instead on the parameter space which characterizes the po beamforming vectors of the sic region .",
    "for the case of treating interference as noise , this was attempted in @xcite , where monotonic optimization was used to find specific po points , e.g. , the maximum sum - rate point .",

    "this number follows from the case where each receiver decodes all @xmath185 interfering signals , which can be done in @xmath186 different orders .",
    "the practical usefulness of our methods has been demonstrated by studies by others .",
    "for example , the closed - form method for computing @xmath82 was used in @xcite for a system - level assessment of inter - operator spectrum sharing .",
    "also , we can use the method for the miso broadcast channel .",
    "however , for this task we have to perform an extra line search to find the optimal power allocation .",

    "<S> we study the two - user multiple - input single - output ( miso ) gaussian interference channel where the transmitters have perfect channel state information and employ single - stream beamforming . </S>",
    "<S> the receivers are capable of performing successive interference cancellation , so when the interfering signal is strong enough , it can be decoded , treating the desired signal as noise , and subtracted from the received signal , before the desired signal is decoded . </S>",
    "<S> we propose efficient methods to compute the pareto - optimal rate points and corresponding beamforming vector pairs , by maximizing the rate of one link given the rate of the other link . </S>",
    "<S> we do so by splitting the original problem into four subproblems corresponding to the combinations of the receivers decoding strategies - either decode the interference or treat it as additive noise . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize recently proposed parameterizations of the optimal beamforming vectors to equivalently reformulate each subproblem as a quasi - concave problem , which we solve very efficiently either analytically or via scalar numerical optimization . </S>",
    "<S> the computational complexity of the proposed methods is several orders - of - magnitude less than the complexity of the state - of - the - art methods . </S>",
