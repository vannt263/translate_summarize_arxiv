    "<S> we consider the one - loop factorization of the simplest twist - three process : inclusive deep - inelastic scattering of longitudinally - polarized leptons on a transversely - polarized nucleon target . by studying the compton amplitudes for certain quark and gluon states at one loop , we find the coefficient functions for the non - singlet twist - three distributions in the factorization formula of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the result marks the first step towards a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) formalism for this transverse - spin - dependent structure function of the nucleon .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.5 cm    deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons on the nucleon is a time - honored example of the success of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd)@xcite . the factorization formulae for the leading structure functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , augmented by the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations for parton distributions @xcite , can describe the available dis data collected over the last 30 years exceedingly well . </S>",
    "<S> although the same formalism is believed to work for the so - called higher - twist structure functions @xcite , e.g. @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which contribute to physical observables down by powers of the hard momentum @xmath5 , there are few detailed studies of them in the literature beyond the tree level . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd radiative corrections to @xmath0 need be investigated as accurate data have recently been taken @xcite and more data will be available in the future @xcite .    in this paper , we report a one - loop study of inclusive deep - inelastic scattering of longitudinally - polarized leptons ( e.g. electrons ) on a transversely - polarized nucleon target @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the subject was first investigated in the context of single parton scattering in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and studies along the same line have continued in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the subtlety of the twist - three process @xcite , those results are sensitive to the treatment of quark masses and are incomplete in the context of qcd fatorization . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , even at tree level one must go beyond the single quark process to derive the correct @xmath3 expression in terms of the parton distributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when loop corrections are included , one needs a general strategy to systematically calculate their contribution to higher twist processes .    for a transversely polarized nucleon of four - momentum @xmath6 and polarization vector @xmath7 , the hadron tensor @xmath8ps\\rangle$ ] </S>",
    "<S> can be expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the photon four - momentum , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is the electromagnetic current of the quarks . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is the combination @xmath16 that naturally appears in the @xmath17-suppressed transverse polarization asymmetry . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we concentrate only on the non - singlet part of @xmath18 ; the singlet case is left to a separate publication . </S>",
    "<S> we seek a factorization formula for @xmath19 to one - loop order in terms of the perturbative coefficient functions @xmath20 and the generalized parton distributions ( correlations ) @xmath21 with two light - cone ( or feynman ) variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the starting point is one - loop forward virtual - photon compton scattering off a few  on - shell \" quark and gluon states . </S>",
    "<S> > from the scattering amplitudes , we examine the validity of infrared factorization and extract the one - loop coefficient functions @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin by outlining a general approach to the factorization of higher - twist observables , generalizing the method of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the twist - two structure functions . for deep - inelastic scattering , it is convenient to consider first the forward compton amplitude @xmath24 the spin - dependent part of the compton amplitude ( antisymmetric in @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) defines two invariant amplitudes @xmath27 , @xmath28 according to the optical theorem , the imaginary part of the @xmath29 amplitudes ( divided by @xmath30 ) is just the nucleon spin structure functions @xmath31 . hence , factorization of @xmath32 naturally leads to factorization of the structure function @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the former has a straightforward feynman - dyson perturbative expansion , making it easily handled .    </S>",
    "<S> according to ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the nucleon compton amplitude @xmath33 can be expressed as a sum of terms that are convolutions of quark - gluon compton scattering amplitudes @xmath34 and the bare quark - gluon correlation functions @xmath35 in the nucleon , as shown schematically in fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath36 implicitly involved in the convolution are integration over the intermediate quark - gluon four - momenta @xmath37 and summation over the spin and color indices . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 , without external quark - gluon legs and self - energies , is the sum of a complete set of feynman diagrams for compton scattering . </S>",
    "<S> these diagrams are calculated in unrenormalized perturbation theory in the sense that all parameters in the expansion are bare . </S>",
    "<S> we use dimensional regularization to regularize both infrared and ultraviolet divergences in the diagrams .    </S>",
    "<S> the pair of light - cone four - vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 define a collinear basis in which the nucleon and photon momenta are written @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , where @xmath43 is an arbitrary dimensionful parameter . </S>",
    "<S> intermediate quark and gluon momenta can also be expressed in this basis : @xmath44 and the full result for @xmath38 can be expanded about @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the leading term in this expansion can be interpreted as scattering of collinear partons with feynman momentum fractions @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> because the partons are on - shell , @xmath38 can be viewed as the parton scattering s - matrix element . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , one must multiply by parton wave function renormalization factors to get the proper s - matrix element . </S>",
    "<S> however , in dimensional regularization , the absence of a physical scale at the massless poles of the quark and gluon propagators reduces these contributions to unity . </S>",
    "<S> subleading terms in the expansion of @xmath38 are parton scattering s - matrix elements with insertions of certain vertices associated with powers of @xmath47 and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , with one power of quark momentum @xmath47 , the subleading term is calculated with one insertion of the vector vertex @xmath49 to one of the quark propagators . because s - matrix elements and their relatives are gauge invariant </S>",
    "<S> , one may choose any gauge for the internal gluon propagators in @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we use feynman s choice in our calculation .    after the collinear expansion and integration over the quark - gluon four momenta , the convolution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ conv ] ) involves integrating over the parton feynman variables @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation functions @xmath35 are matrix elements of gauge - invariant nonlocal quark and gluon operators in one - to - one correspondence with the external parton states in @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when @xmath38 contains momentum - related vertex insertions , the quark and/or gluon fields in @xmath35 appear with partial derivatives . </S>",
    "<S> the collinear expansion results in all qcd fields separated in spacetime along the light - cone direction @xmath51 . as in the leading - twist case , expanding the gluon polarization indices and summing over all contributions from longitudinally - polarized gluons generates straightline gauge - links which connect fields at separate spacetime points . to simplify the derivation of a factorization formula , we use the light - cone gauge ( @xmath52 ) , or link - free , expression for @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this gauge choice allows one to focus on the physical partons without worrying about the effects of the longitudinally polarized gluons . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge - invariant form of the factorization is recovered simply by imposing gauge invariance on the final form of parton correlations .    as we have argued above , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34 is ultraviolet finite because the on - shell wave function renormalization is trivial in dimensional regularization . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , due to the massless on - shell external states , @xmath34 has infrared divergences showing up as @xmath53 poles . </S>",
    "<S> these divergences may be factorized in the perturbative sense @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the finite coefficient function and @xmath56 contains only the @xmath53 poles . on the other hand , the infrared - finite quantities @xmath35 contain ultraviolet divergences which also show up as @xmath53 poles . </S>",
    "<S> when the infrared poles in @xmath56 cancel all the ultraviolet poles in @xmath35 , @xmath33 is said to be factorizable . </S>",
    "<S> the product @xmath57 defines the renormalized parton correlation functions @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the final factorization formula for the compton amplitude is then @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a well - defined perturbation series in @xmath61 and @xmath58 is a finite nonperturbative distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> we apply the above discussion to compton scattering on a transversely polarized nucleon . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , the non - singlet twist - three process involves two possible intermediate parton states in the light - cone gauge . first is the two - quark state with the transverse momentum flowing through @xmath62 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> after taylor - expansion , we keep only the contribution with exactly one insertion of the @xmath49 vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding correlation function is @xmath63 where the dirac and color indices on quark fields are open and @xmath64 is perpendicular to @xmath65 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the second intermediate parton state involves two quark lines and one gluon line , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b . </S>",
    "<S> if we use the feynman rule @xmath66 for the gluon attachment to @xmath67 , the corresponding correlation function is @xmath68 we remind the reader that all fields and the couplings here are bare . to decouple the spin and color indices in @xmath38 and @xmath35 , we write explicitly @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of colors , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> in dimensional regularization , @xmath73 must be defined explicitly . here , we follow t hooft and veltman s convention .    with appropriate insertions of light - cone gauge links , which can be generated by summing over intermediate states with additional longitudinally - polarized gluons , we define the following gauge - invariant parton correlations @xcite </S>",
    "<S> : @xmath74 one may argue that this is not the only way to obtain gauge invariant correlations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the combination @xmath75 is the light - cone expression for a gauge invariant distribution involving the gluon field strength rather than the covariant derivative . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> these contributions necessarily involve coefficients @xmath76 that vanish when @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([vanish ] ) then implies that one can consider instead the combination of eq.([combine ] ) free of charge . </S>",
    "<S> hence these are the only distributions relevant to our process . </S>",
    "<S> using hermitian conjugation , it is easy to show that @xmath78 is symmetric in @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath79 is antisymmetric </S>",
    "<S> . we will use these symmetries to simplify our presentation of the coefficient functions .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the use of the above approach to the tree diagrams shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , where we have shown @xmath80 only . </S>",
    "<S> those diagrams for @xmath62 can be obtained simply by replacing the gluon interaction @xmath66 by the transverse vector vertex @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 corresponds to the following on - shell process : a quark and gluon with four - momenta @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , scatter with a photon of four - momentum @xmath10 , producing a quark of four - momentum @xmath83 and a forward photon . </S>",
    "<S> the compton amplitude can easily be calculated using the usual feynman rules . when the quark and gluon combine before or after interacting with the photons , the intermediate propagator , @xmath84 , drawn with a bar in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 , is singular and needs regularization . </S>",
    "<S> adding an infinitesimal @xmath85 , one arrives at @xmath86 the first term yields zero when acting on the external quark wave function , so only the second term contributes . combining the result from @xmath62 and taking into account crossing symmetry , we find the following gauge - invariant expression for the tree - level compton amplitude @xmath87-(x_b\\rightarrow -x_b)\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the non - singlet part of the quark charge squared and @xmath89 . the integration has support only for @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath91 , the above expression develops an imaginary part through @xmath92 . using the optical theorem , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the following tree result for @xmath93 , @xmath94 > from qcd equations of motion , one can show @xmath95 where @xmath96 is defined as @xmath97 this object seems to have a simple physical interpretation .    </S>",
    "<S> the tree level result suggests the following all - order factorization formula for the non - singlet part of @xmath98 , @xmath99 @xmath100 can be written in terms of a perturbation series in the strong coupling @xmath61 , @xmath101 the tree result yields @xmath102    now we come to the main subject of the paper : one - loop radiative corrections for @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> all the feynman diagrams for @xmath104 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 . the first 12 diagrams have color factor @xmath105 , the next 8 come with the factor @xmath106 , and the final 4 with @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> since the external transverse momentum of the quark only goes through the quark propagators , the taylor - expansion of @xmath62 yields the vector vertex insertion on the quark line only . </S>",
    "<S> these diagrams correspond to the first 20 diagrams in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 with the external gluon vertex replaced by the vector vertex . </S>",
    "<S> an inspection of the one - loop feynman integrals reveals a simple rule : @xmath62 is just the @xmath105 part of @xmath104 and , hence , the former need not be calculated separately .    </S>",
    "<S> since all feynman diagrams are computed in bare perturbation theory , the result depends on the bare coupling @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> we replace it with a renormalized coupling in the @xmath109 scheme , with a difference of higher order in @xmath110 . after a lengthy calculation involving one - loop integrals with up to five internal feynman propagators , </S>",
