    "recent progress in the studies of single atoms and molecules on ultrathin - insulating films supported by a metal substrate have opened up a new frontier in atomic scale science . not only are these films able to decouple the electronic states of the adsorbates from the metal substrate states , but they also provide sufficient tunnelling current to be able to characterise , manipulate and image the adsorbed species by a scanning tunnelling microscope .",
    "some important examples include charge state control of adsorbed species",
    "@xcite , imaging of frontier orbitals @xcite , coherent electron - nuclear coupling in molecular wires @xcite and tunnelling - induced switching of adsorbed molecules @xcite .",
    "in particular , polar films such as nacl bilayers are able to support multiple charge states of adsorbed species , which can be switched in a controlled manner by attachment and detachment of tunnelling electrons .",
    "furthermore , these processes have been suggested to be responsible for the observed reversible bond formation in molecular switches @xcite . to fully exploit the new potential opportunities provided by these systems ,",
    "there is a need of theory to unravel the electronic and geometric structure and the excited state potentials of anionic and cationic states of the adsorbed species .",
    "some important advances in this respect have been made by using density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite calculations  @xcite .",
    "however , the delocalisation error in the current exchange - correlation functionals and the system size make the calculations very challenging .",
    "in fact , this error in current density functionals can result in fractional occupation of the adsorbed species and makes it difficult to identify various multiply charged states @xcite .",
    "even with these limitations , important progress has been made by using dft+u @xcite to correct for the self - interaction behind the delocalisation error for a ag atom @xcite , despite it is generally a bit dubious for delocalised states such as for @xmath1 states of atoms @xcite .",
    "there has also been some developments in constraining the occupancy of adsorbate orbitals , but this requires that one has to identify the appropriate kohn - sham orbital , which can still be challenging due to the mixing of adsorbate and substrate states albeit being very small @xcite . however , when considering , for example , organic molecules adsorbed on an ultrathin - insulating film supported by a metal surface , the number of metal atoms and the associated number of metal electrons makes the calculations to become prohibitively large .    as a first step to try to overcome these limitations ,",
    "we present a new simplified dft method for the calculation of the total energy , ionic ( hellman - feynman ) forces and electronic structure of a charged system placed in front of a metal surface . in this method ,",
    "the charged system is fully treated using dft , the interaction between the two systems is assumed to be electrostatic and the density response of the metal surface to the electrostatic interaction is treated to linear order .",
    "the proposed method has two main advantages .",
    "firstly , the computational effort is significantly decreased , since the metal electron states are not treated explicitly but only implicitly through their density response to an external electrostatic field , which can be captured using a simple model . here",
    ", we have explicitly considered the classical perfect conductor ( pc ) model for the metal response in which the screening length by the conduction electrons is assumed to be zero and the screening charge only resides on the perfect conductor plane .",
    "secondly , different charge states of the charged system can be handled directly using this method .",
    "we have implemented this new methodology in the vasp code  @xcite using the simple pc model for the metal response .",
    "a critical test of this implementation is provided by the example of the na@xmath0 ion outside a perfect conductor . here",
    ", the six electrons in the @xmath2 semi - core of the na@xmath0 ion were included in the calculations .",
    "the results show an excellent agreement between the calculated hellman - feynman force on the ion and the negative gradient of the interaction energy even in the region close to the perfect conductor plane , where the electron density of the ion overlaps with the induced charge density at perfect conductor plane .",
    "furthermore , the small polarisability of the ion makes the calculated interaction energy to be in close agreement with the analytical result for a point charge model outside the perfect conductor .    in applying this method to study charged adsorbates deposited over ultrathin - insulating films supported by a metal substrate",
    ", we need to extend the pc model by including the interactions between the film and the metal substrate arising from overlapping electron densities and van der waals interactions .",
    "we plan to capture these interactions through a simple parametrised force field between the metal substrate and the ions in the film , where parameters will be obtained by fitting the force field to dft calculations of the forces between the film ( without adsorbates ) and the metal substrate .",
    "a successful implementation of this force field should enable us to describe , for example , the observed reversible bond formation of a molecular switch induced by a tunnelling electron and hole attachment to form ionic adsorbate states  @xcite .",
    "the presentation of this scheme and associated results are deferred to a future publication .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in the next section [ sec :",
    "theory ] , we present the theoretical background of the proposed method .",
    "first , the effective energy density functional and the associated hellman - feynman forces for the charged system are derived in subsection [ sub : approx - energy - df ] under the assumption that the electrons of the charged system and the metal surface are distinguishable .",
    "the total energy of the metal surface is expanded up to second order in the resulting electrostatic interaction between the two systems . in the next subsection [ sub : pbc - dipole ]",
    ", the non - trivial effects on the electrostatics when imposing periodic boundary conditions are analysed and appropriate dipole corrections for the total energy and the hellman - feynman forces are derived .",
    "the classical perfect conductor model for the metal surface response is then introduced in the next subsection [ sub : pc - model ] . here , we also present analytical expressions for the interaction energy and force in the case of a point charge ( subsection [ sub : intpointcharge ] ) in the presence of periodic boundary conditions , and discuss possible refinements of the perfect conductor model ( subsection [ sub : beyondpc ] ) . in section [ sec : compimpl ] , the keys steps in implementing the pc model in the plane wave code vasp are presented . as a first test of this methodology",
    ", we show the results of the computational implementation of the pc model for the case of na@xmath0 ion outside a pc ( section [ sec : results ] ) and finally give some concluding remarks in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section we develop a density functional theoretical description of a charged system placed in front of a metal surface based on the assumption that the electrons of both fragments are distinguishable , so that the interaction between the two systems is only electrostatic .",
    "the corresponding approximation becomes valid when the electron densities of the two systems are well separated .",
    "we analyse how the system can be treated in a supercell geometry and derive expressions for the dipole correction of the kohn - sham potential and the hellmann - feynman forces . as an explicit model for the metal surface ,",
    "we focus on the classical perfect conductor ( pc ) model of the metal surface response , but also discuss possible extensions of this approximation . for the particular case of a point charge",
    ", we present explicit expressions for the interaction energy with a perfect conductor . throughout the paper",
    ", we will make use of electrostatic units .",
    "we consider a closed , charged system @xmath3 of electrons and ions outside a metal surface @xmath4 .",

    "the total energy density functional for the combined system is then given by the following expression : @xmath8=e_{s}[n_{s}]+e_{m}[n_{m}]- \\mu n_{m}+\\int\\rho_{m}({\\bf r})\\phi_{s}({\\bf r})d{\\bf    r}\\ .\\label{eq : etotapp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] are the energy density functionals for the isolated @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , whereas @xmath11 is the charge density of @xmath4 and @xmath12 the total number of electrons of @xmath4 .",

    "furthermore , any neglected non - additive contributions to the kinetic energy and the exchange - correlation potential including any non - local contribution between @xmath4 and @xmath3 , such as the van der waals interaction , will be accounted by introducing a force field between @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
