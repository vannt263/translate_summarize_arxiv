    "radiation from sase xfel consists of many independent spikes in both the temporal and spectral domains .",
    "self - seeding is a promising approach to significantly narrow the sase bandwidth to produce nearly transform - limited pulses @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we discussed the implementation of a single - crystal self - seeding scheme in the hard x - ray lines of european xfel in @xcite .",
    "for this facility , transform - limited pulses are particularly valuable , since they naturally support the extraction of more fel power than at saturation by exploiting tapering in the tunable - gap baseline undulators @xcite-@xcite .",
    "tapering is implemented as a stepwise change of the undulator gap from segment to segment .",
    "simulation results presented in @xcite show that the fel power of the transform - limited x - ray pulses may be increased up to @xmath8 tw by operating with the tapered baseline undulator sase1 ( or sase2 ) .",
    "in particular , it is possible to create a source capable of delivering fully - coherent , @xmath9 fs ( fwhm)-long x - ray pulses with @xmath10 photons per pulse at a wavelength of @xmath11 nm , fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .",
    "the method exploits a combination of cascade self - seeding scheme with single crystal monochromator and undulator tapering technique . the amplification- monochromatization cascade scheme is distinguished , in performance , by spectral purity of the output radiation and smaller heat loading of crystals .",

    "we propose to perform monochromatization at @xmath11 nm with the help of self - seeding , and amplify the seed in a first part of the output undulator .",
    "the amplification process can be stopped at some position well before the fel reaches saturation , where the electron beam gets considerable bunching at the @xmath13nd harmonic of the coherent radiation .",
    "a second part of the output undulator tuned to the @xmath13nd harmonic frequency , follows beginning at that position , and is used to obtain @xmath13nd harmonic radiation at saturation .",
    "one can prolong the exchange of energy to the advantage of the photon beam by tapering the last part of the output undulator on a segment by segment basis .",

    "we describe a photon beam distribution system , which may allow to switch the hard x - ray beam quickly among many experiments in order to make a more effective use of the facility .",
    "monochromaticity is the key for implementing multi - user operation in the hard x - ray range , which can be granted by using crystal deflectors and small absorption of the radiation in crystals at photon energies larger than @xmath14 kev .",
    "in contrast to the broadband sase bandwidth , transform - limited hard x - ray bandwidths are of order of @xmath15 , and match the bragg width of crystals .",
    "thus , using @xmath16 mm thick diamond crystals one may obtain two beams , one transmitted and one bragg reflected , with minimum intensity loss .",
    "we suggest to flip crystals for switching reflectivity similarly as for polarization switching techniques with x - ray phase retarders at synchrotron radiation facilities , that is based on the use of piezo - electric components .",
    "crystal deflectors can be repeated a number of times to form an almost complete ring .",
    "it is then possible to distribute monochromatic hard x - rays among ten independent experiments .",
    "in this section we describe a concept for a photon beam distribution system , which may allow to switch the fel beam quickly among many instruments in order to make a more effective use of the facility .",
    "the high photon energy , and monochromaticity of the output radiation are the key for reaching such result .",
    "the deflector can be simply switched off by tilting it , which results in a change of the angle of incidence of the radiation .",
    "the angular change necessary for switching on and off the reflected beam is less than @xmath17 mrad .",
    "only @xmath18 of incoming @xmath0 kev radiation is absorbed outside the reflection range . , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in fact , dealing with @xmath0 kev monochromatic radiation one may use crystals as deflectors , fig .",
    "the deflector is constituted by a diamond plate with a thickness of @xmath16 mm .",
    "the crystal is used in bragg reflection geometry and exploits the c(111 ) reflection plane . for the c(111 )",
    "reflection , the angular acceptance of the crystal deflector is of the order of @xmath19rad , and the spectral bandwidth is about @xmath20 . as a result ,",
    "the angular acceptance of the deflector is much wider compared to the photon beam divergence , which is of the order of a microrad .",
    "the bandwidth of the hard x - ray pulse is of order of @xmath15 and matches the bragg width of the crystal . in this case ,",
    "more than @xmath21 of the peak reflectivity can be achieved and only @xmath18 of the incoming @xmath0 kev radiation is absorbed outside of the reflection range .",
    "thus , by use of a @xmath16 mm - thick diamond crystal one may obtain two beams , a transmitted as well as a bragg reflected beam , with minimal intensity loss .",
    "one of the biggest advantages of using a crystal deflector in bragg geometry is that the reflected beam can be switched on and off by changing the crystal angle only .",
    "the typical angular change necessary for the switching is less than @xmath17 mrad .",
    "this opens a new possibility of fast switching of the reflectivity , which is necessary for many - user operation . in order to achieve a stable photon beam deflection",
    ", the rotation error must be less than @xmath22 mrad .",
    "existing technology enables rotating crystals to satisfy this requirements .",
    "for example , at synchrotron radiation facilities , x - ray phase retarder crystals are driven by piezo - electric devices operated at hundred @xmath23 repetition rate , which flip the crystals with a rotation error of about a fraction of a micro - radian @xcite .",
    "kev constitutes the key for reaching such result.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    a photon beam distribution system based on flipping crystals can provide an efficient way to obtain a many - user facility . a possible layout is shown in fig . [ f4 ] .",
    "the output radiation passes through the distribution system , consisting of a series of crystals in bragg geometry .",
    "photon macro - pulses at @xmath0 kev photon energy can then be fed into @xmath3 separate beamlines .",
    "the switching crystals need to flip at frequency @xmath24 hz , so that each user receives one macropulse per second .",
    "it should be noted that the single crystal provides a sufficiently large deflection angle ( of order of @xmath2 degrees ) , so that the problem of separation of neighboring beamlines does not exist .",
    "the layout of the user instruments follows a similar approach as for synchrotron radiation sources .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    a second possible layout of a future hard x - ray laboratory based on a hard - photon `` ring '' distribution system is shown in fig . [ f5 ] .",
    "one can use a number of crystal reflectors to form an almost complete ring . the photon beam transport line guiding photons from sase1 ( or sase2 ) to the experimental hall",
    "is connected tangentially to one of the straight section of the photon ring , and the beam is injected by the reflecting crystal .",
    "using flipping crystals in each photon ring cell it is possible to quickly switch the photon beam from one instrument to the other , thus providing many - user capability .",
    "this layout of the laboratory follows a similar approach as for synchrotron light sources .",
    "finally , it should be remarked that the proposed beam distribution system operates at fixed wavelength .",
    "however as reported in @xcite : `` for many scattering experiments it is not necessary to continuously vary the x - ray wavelength or fine - tune to a core shell resonance .",
    "generally , however it is desirable to have a large photon energy exceeding @xmath3 kev .",
    "this optimizes probing condensed matter systems on the atomic length scale by minimizing deleterious absorption , while preserving scattering cross sections '' .",
    "obviously , our idea to increase the user access by means of a `` photon ring '' has advantages for such kind of experiments and can be applied to the european xfel as well as to the lcls - ii design .",
    "in this section we report on a feasibility study performed with the help of the fel code genesis 1.3 @xcite running on a parallel machine . we will present a feasibility study for a short - pulse mode of operation of the sase1 and sase2 fel lines of the european xfel , based on a statistical analysis consisting of @xmath1 runs .",
