    "mesogranulation was historically introduced as a prominent scale imprinted on the horizontal photospheric flows calculated through local correlation tracking ( lct ) of intensity images @xcite : both the pattern of positive and negative divergence of that flow as well as the time evolution of lagrange tracers moving in it revealed cells with sizes between , say , @xmath8 and @xmath7 arcsec .",
    "much debate ensued concerning whether the mesogranular flow patterns correspond to actual convection cells in that range of sizes rather than , e.g. , to simple granule associations which persist in time ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "independent hints for the existence of a convective flow operating on those scales are therefore of importance .",
    "the study of the surface distribution of magnetic elements can provide such hints ; as a minimum , it can constitute an alternative avenue , independent of the inaccuracies of lct methods , to determine the properties of the mesogranular patterns .",
    "such an approach has been employed by @xcite using ground - based data and by @xcite and @xcite using satellite observations . in those papers ,",

    ", detailed quantitative studies and statistics that could put such an association on a firmer basis are still missing .",
    "the aim of this letter is to obtain quantitative information of the relation between photospheric magnetic flux distributions and mesogranular scales by using the observations of unprecedented quality provided by the imaging magnetograph experiment ( imax ; @xcite ) aboard the sunrise balloon - borne observatory @xcite .",
    "imax provides time series of virtually seeing - free high spatial resolution ( @xmath9 arcsec ) images and magnetograms that constitute an ideal data set for the study of photospheric magnetism . using the sunrise / imax data ,",
    "we combine information from ( a ) the velocity field gained through local correlation tracking of intensity images ; ( b ) the spatial patterns provided by the magnetograms ; and ( c ) the field line structure obtained through extrapolation of the magnetogram data , to gain quantitative information concerning patterns at intermediate scales between granulation and supergranulation .",

    "images were taken at five wavelengths along the profile of the magnetic - sensitive fei @xmath11   line located at @xmath12 m , @xmath13 m  from line center , and continuum at @xmath14 m . the estimated circular polarization noise is @xmath15 in units of the continuum wavelength for non - reconstructed data and @xmath16 times larger for the reconstructed one .",
    "imax has a spectral resolution of @xmath17 m  and a spatial resolution of @xmath18 km @xcite .",
    "the reduction procedure produces time series of images with a cadence of @xmath19 s , spatial sampling of @xmath20 km and a field - of - view ( fov ) of @xmath21 mm@xmath22 .",
    "we use two time series , the first one comprising @xmath23 snapshots ( @xmath24 minutes ) and the second one @xmath25 snapshots ( @xmath26 minutes ) .",
    "magnetograms are derived from inversions of the observed stokes parameters using the sir code @xcite .",
    "we call these magnetograms the _ reconstructed data_. in this letter we mainly use the reconstructed data except in the last section ( sec .",
    "[ sec : extrapolation ] ) where , in addition , we use so - called _ calibrated data _ ,",
    "i.e. , magnetograms obtained using a proportionality law between stokes - v ( from non - reconstructed data ) and @xmath27 ( for details of this method , see * ? ? ?",
    "the intensity maps are taken from the reconstructed data .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] displays a map of normalized continuum intensity ( top ) and the corresponding longitudinal magnetogram ( bottom ) , the latter showing many internetwork flux concentrations alongside stronger flux elements probably belonging to the network .",
    "following the traditional method , mesogranular patterns are outlined by using lagrange tracers ( popularly known as _",
    "corks _ ) arranged at time @xmath28 uniformly in a 2d grid that coincides with the observational pixel matrix .",
    "then , the corks are advected following the instantaneous horizontal velocity field along the whole duration of the time series ( here we use the second time series : @xmath26 minutes ) .",
    "the horizontal velocity field is determined using the local correlation tracking ( lct ) algorithm by @xcite applied to consecutive continuum intensity images .",
    "the correlation is performed in local windows weighted by a gaussian function with fwhm=320 km .",
    "often , in the literature , the velocity field determined through lct and used to advect corks is a time average of the noisy determinations of the instantaneous velocity fields for consecutive snapshots ( for a discussion about the effect of time averaging see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high signal - to - noise ratio , the high spatial and temporal resolution and the absence of atmospheric distortion in the imax data make it possible to evaluate clean velocity fields and consequently to compute cork advection without time averaging .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show ( white dots ) the distribution of corks at @xmath29 min , i.e. , toward the end of the series , on the background of the continuum intensity image at that time .",
    "the corks clearly delineate cells of mesogranular size containing several granules .",
    "in fact , the vast majority of corks are located in the lanes between those cells ( which we will call here mesogranular lanes or _ mesolanes _ for short ) .",
    "a clear mesogranular pattern with the majority of the corks concentrated in mesolanes is already visible after only some 20 minutes from @xmath28 .",
    "this is less than the time ( 2 - 4 hours ) reported by @xcite using the hinode / sot narrowband filter imager .    in order to obtain quantitative measures for the mesogranular network",
    "we define a _ cork density function _ , @xmath30 , by counting the number of corks in each pixel in the image .",
    "to provide an upper bound for the width of the mesolanes , we scan the image vertically using whole horizontal lines and calculate the width ( @xmath31 of the maximum ) of the peaks of the @xmath30 function in each line .",
    "we then derive an average peak width for the whole scan .",
    "if we use all peaks above @xmath32 , then the resulting upper bound for the lane width is @xmath33 km .",
    "the largest concentrations of corks are located in narrow mesolanes : using all peaks above @xmath34 , for instance , yields a width of @xmath35 km ( @xmath36 pixels ) . given the random orientation of the mesolanes , their actual width is certainly below those numbers . using a horizontal scan instead of a vertical one yields basically the same numbers ( the maximum deviation is @xmath37 ) .",
    "a first test of the relation between mesogranules and the surface magnetic field can be obtained by studying the spatial association between mesogranular cells and magnetic flux concentrations . through visual inspection ,",
    "various researchers have obtained indications that the magnetic field concentrations with higher flux density are distributed at the boundaries of cells of mesogranular size ( @xmath8 to @xmath7 arc sec ; see @xcite and @xcite ) ; in fact , @xcite shows the preference of elements with flux density above @xmath38 g to be located in regions of high negative divergence of the horizontal vlocity .",
    "further visual evidence is provided by @xcite who plot stokes - v images obtained with hinode / nfi on top of cork distributions showing a relationship between magnetic field concentrations and cork lanes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the conclusions at that level can be reinforced through our high - resolution maps by drawing contours of @xmath39 down to small values , like @xmath40 g. the red and yellow contours in fig .",

    "we use as a proxy for the mesolanes the locations with cork density above a threshold , @xmath46 , and use the values @xmath47 corks / pixel .",
    "all of those values yield clear mesogranular lanes , as apparent , e.g. , in the top - right and bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , drawn for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "increasing @xmath50 decreases the level of connectivity of the lanes .",
    "we then focus on the mesolanes defined by @xmath51 and study which fraction of the magnetic elements are really in ( or near ) them . to obtain a quantitative estimate , for each fixed threshold intensity @xmath52 in the range @xmath53 g , we consider the set of pixels with @xmath54 and calculate which fraction of the set is located in 3-pixel neighborhoods of the mesolanes .",

    "we see approximate horizontal asymptotes in all cases , and all are reached for @xmath52 between @xmath58 to @xmath5 g. we conclude that the vast majority of pixel elements with @xmath59 g is located in the near neighborhood of locations with high cork density . for the least restrictive case ( @xmath60 ) ,",
    "virtually all magnetic elements with @xmath61 g are located in the neighborhood of the mesolanes . for large @xmath50 ( e.g. , @xmath62 c / p , orange curve ) ,",
    "the resulting areas have less connectivity and do not delineate so clearly the mesogranular network .",
    "correspondingly , the asymptotic percentage values for @xmath63 g become smaller .",
    "the width of the 3-pixel neighborhoods of the mesolanes is shown in the bottom - right panel for the @xmath64 corks / pixel case .",
    "the panel shows a fully developed network of mesolanes covering only @xmath65% of the whole surface ( which , of course , coincides with the @xmath66 limit of the red curve ) . as an aside note ,",
    "all curves remain basically the same if we remove the prominent network element located in the lower part of fig .",
    "as a further test of the relation between surface fields and convection at different scales , in this section we study the statistics of footpoint separation between field lines linking the magnetic elements observed with imax . to that end , we calculate the magnetic field vector in the atmosphere using force - free field extrapolations ( fff ) from the imax data .",
    "we use a code with weighted optimization method ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the force - free assumption is equivalent to assuming that the electrical current @xmath67 and the magnetic field @xmath68 are parallel , or , using ampre s law : @xmath69 @xmath70 in eq .",
    "[ eqn : exp1 ] measures the level of field line twist .",
    "the field values obtained with the imax data correspond to the height where the fe i 5250.2   line is formed .",
    "although the photosphere is not a small-@xmath71 plasma ( with @xmath71 the ratio of gas to magnetic pressures ) , there are theoretical and observational indications @xcite that the force - free assumption is acceptable when calculating extrapolations starting from those heights .",

    "@xcite , using the same imax data , show that values of @xmath70 in the range @xmath74 lead to similar values in the statistical properties they analyzed for the extrapolated field lines .    for computational reasons",
    ", we have calculated the extrapolations in a box of @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath75 equally spaced grid points , keeping the original horizontal dimensions , leading to a cell size of @xmath77 km . yet",

    "the field line footpoints are seen to cluster on field concentrations in the domain . in agreement with the conclusions of @xcite",
    ", this figure shows a rough proportionality between the footpoint distance and the height reached by the field lines .",
    "calling @xmath87 the distance between footpoints , we calculate the probability density function ( pdf ) for @xmath87 using as statistical ensemble for each time series the field lines in each snapshot and the whole collection of snapshots in the series .",
    "to include a field line in the study , we request a flux density above @xmath88 g on both footpoints .",
    "the resulting pdfs are shown in fig .",

    "the curves show a deviation from the exponential .",
    "this _ bump _",
    "most probably corresponds to the presence in that time series of strong network elements .",
    "anyway , given the size of the imax field of view ( @xmath1 mm ) and the long duration of the largest convection cells , we can not draw statistical inferences from the pdf for scales above , say , @xmath7 mm . on the other hand ,",
    "we have carried out a kolmogorov - smirnov test of the goodness of fit of the footpoint distance data in the @xmath6-@xmath7 mm range to a lognormal distribution , additionally to the exponential distribution ; a lognormal distribution is found to fit well magnetogram data or , more generally , data resulting from the fragmentation of magnetic elements ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . in our case , the test , carried out for individual snapshots in the given distance range , favors the exponential distribution .",
    "details of this analysis will be given in a publication in preparation .",
    "we note the constancy of the slope of the pdf at scales between @xmath6 and @xmath7 mm and that the characteristic decay distance is approximately @xmath92 mm .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the fact that there are no intrinsic horizontal scales in that range other than granulation , e.g. , because mesogranulation is the direct result of other convection scales , rather than representing a primary scale in which energy is being injected into the convective flows .",
    "10 mm.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "an important open question in solar physics is the precise nature of the convection scales with size and duration above the granular values . while both granulation and supergranulation yield velocity field patterns that have been observed at the surface , mesogranules have been detected only through indirect proxies , like tracking of intensity patterns , which do not provide reliable evidence of underlying convection cells in that range of sizes and durations . there is an ongoing debate on whether there is a continuum of sizes for the convection cells on scales above granular , possibly with self - similar properties and with no particular scale being singled out within that range @xcite , or whether the mesogranular scales are just the result of a collective interaction between families of granules .",
    "the magnetic field can provide an alternative and more direct avenue to explore convective patterns since the magnetic flux can be measured directly using stokes polarimetry techniques .",
    "the magnetic elements appear with a broad spectrum of flux densities @xcite and can also be detected through g - band or ca - ii bright points ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore can provide important clues concerning the nature of the flows underlying the mesogranular scales as well as about the magnetic elements themselves .",
    "the high spatial and temporal cadences of the imax data allow us to try a few different , complementary studies of the relation between magnetic field and mesogranular flows .",
    "first , we have carried out lagrange tracing of mass elements following horizontal flow fields obtained through lct of intensity maps ; we have obtained a number of improvements compared with traditional cork maps ( faster development of the mesogranular lanes , no need for time averages ) . we have also obtained an upper bound for the width of the mesogranular lanes of some @xmath3 km .",
    "second , we have provided quantitative measures for the association between magnetic elements and mesogranular lanes . the large majority ( @xmath17 % ) of the magnetic elements with flux density above @xmath18 g",
    "are found in @xmath93-km neighborhoods of mesogranular lanes with @xmath94 and about @xmath58 % of flux elements above @xmath40 g are located near mesogranular lanes with @xmath45 .",
    "our results indicate a good coupling between the flow field and the magnetic elements , suggesting that the evolution of the latter is mostly kinematic .",
    "third , we have considered the connectivity between magnetic elements and , in particular , the distance between footpoints of field lines anchored in the photosphere .",
    "the probability density function of such distances shows that there is abundant connectivity on mesogranular scales ; it also shows that the distribution is basically featureless in those scales , with only one characteristic value , the slope of the distribution , equal to @xmath95 .",
    "our results concerning statistics of separations of field line footpoints suggest that there is no intrinsic scale of convection in the mesogranular range .",
    "this may only mean that there is no mechanism for direct injection of energy into convection on those scales , but does not rule out the existence of convection cells with those sizes , e.g. , through nonlinear interactions of cells at other scales ( as in a turbulent cascade ) or through the interaction of thermal downflows @xcite ."
