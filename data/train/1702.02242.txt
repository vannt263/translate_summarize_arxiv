    "the maximum entropy principle provides natural criteria for estimating the least biased density function subject to the given moments @xcite .",
    "this density estimation approach has a wide range applications , such as , the harmonic solid and quantum spin systems @xcite , econometrics @xcite , and geophysical applications @xcite . in a nutshell , this moment constrained method is a parametric estimation technique where the resulting density function is in the form of an exponential of polynomials .",
    "this is a consequence of maximizing the shannon entropy subject to the polynomial moment constraints , which is usually transformed into an unconstrained minimization problem of the lagrangian function @xcite .",
    "standard approaches for solving this unconstrained minimization problem are based on the newton s iterative method @xcite or quasi - newton s based method such as the bfgs scheme @xcite .    in the last two papers @xcite , where the bfgs - based method was introduced and reviewed",
    ", they considered minimization problems that involve 44 - 83 equations , resulting from two- , four- , and six - dimensional problems with moment constraints of up to order eight , six , and four , respectively . in this paper , we introduce a novel equation solver s that can be used to find density function of moderately high dimensional problems ( e.g. , systems of 70 - 310 equations resulting from moments up to order four of 4 - 7 dimensional density functions ) provided that the solutions exist .",
    "the proposed scheme , which we called the equation - by - equation ( ebe ) method , is an iterative method that solves a one - dimensional problem at the first iterate , a two - dimensional problem at the second iterate , a three - dimensional problem at the third iterate , and eventually , solves the full system of nonlinear equations corresponding to the maximum entropy problem at the last iterate .",
    "technically , this method combines the newton s method with ideas from homotopy continuation .",
    "we will show that the ebe method is locally convergent under appropriate conditions .",
    "furthermore , we will provide sufficient conditions for global convergence . through the convergence analysis",
    ", we will show that , geometrically , the proposed method finds the solution of the nonlinear system of equations by tracking along the surface corresponding to one component of the system of nonlinear equations .",
    "we shall find that the ebe method produces more accurate solutions ( smaller error in the moments ) compared to the bfgs scheme tested on the test problem in @xcite .",
    "numerically , we will demonstrate that the ebe method is able to solve a problem where the true solutions ranging from order one to thousand .",
    "we shall see also that the ebe method can solve a system of hundreds of equations in various examples ranging from those with explicit solutions as well as those with densities estimated based on solutions of complex spatially extended dynamical systems .",
