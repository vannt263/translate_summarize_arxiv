    "<S> such systems the state dependent diffusion coefficient , @xmath0 , felt by the brownian particle could arise either due to space dependent friction or presence of local hotspots @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge , in almost all the above mentioned cases </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding langevin equation is either written phenomenologically or is constructed from a microscopic system heat bath hamiltonian model where the associated heat bath is in thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> to generate directed motion one then applies an external perturbation , time periodic force or correlated random force , to break the symmetry of the force field as equilibrium thermal fluctuations are unable to create spontaneous symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry breaking can be also achieved by considering a nonlinear coupling between the brownian particle and thermal heat bath thereby generating a multiplicative noise term in the resulting langevin equation which in turn gives a position dependent diffusion term effectively creating a phase induced bias in the dynamics . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a system heat bath model where the heat bath is weakly modulated by an external noise . </S>",
    "<S> although the microscopic model we present here has a close kinship to our earlier approach @xcite to study escape from a metastable state within the context of external noise modulated heat bath , the present formalism differs from our earlier model in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> the heat bath - external noise coupling is considered to be nonlinear and in addition to that the system is also nonlinearly coupled with the heat bath thereby resulting in a nonlinear multiplicative langevin equation and the corresponding fokker - planck - smoluchowski equation with space dependent diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> we then explore the possibility of observing directed transport as a result of phase difference between the coupling function and the periodic potential in which the brownian particle is moving . </S>",

    "<S> one can carry out the experiment in a photochemically active solvent ( the heat bath ) where the solvent is under the influence of external monochromatic light with fluctuating intensity of a wavelength which is absorbed solely by the solvent molecules . as a result of it </S>",
    "<S> the modulated solvent heats up due to the conversion of light energy into heat energy by radiationless relaxation process and an effective temperature like quantity develops due to the constant input of energy . since the fluctuations in the light intensity result in the polarization of the solvent molecules , the effective reaction field around the reactants gets modified @xcite .    to start with we consider a classical particle of unit mass bilinearly </S>",

    "<S> , we note that , the forcing term @xmath45 is deterministic as expected . </S>",
    "<S> it ceases to be deterministic when it is not possible to specify all the @xmath48-s and @xmath49-s , i.e. , the initial conditions of all the bath variables , exactly . the standard procedure to overcome this problem is to consider a distribution of @xmath36 and @xmath37 to specify the statistical properties of the bath dependent forcing term @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the bath oscillators is assumed to be a canonical distribution of gaussian form @xmath50 = z^{-1 } \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{h_b + h_{sb}}{k_bt } \\right ] \\label{neq4}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51 is the bath partition function . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of the distribution function of bath variables makes the internal noise @xmath45 gaussian . </S>",
    "<S> it is now easy to verify the statistical properties of @xmath45 as @xmath52 and @xmath53 . where @xmath54 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath55 is the equilibrium temperature . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 implies the average over the initial distributions of bath variables which is assumed to be a canonical distribution of gaussian form as given in eq.([neq4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second relation is the celebrated fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite which ensures that the bath was in thermal equilibrium at @xmath29 .    to identify eq.([12 ] ) as a generalized langevin equation we must impose some conditions on the coupling coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath16 , on the bath frequencies @xmath57 and on the number @xmath1 of the bath oscillators that will ensure that @xmath44 is indeed dissipative and the last term in eq.([12 ] ) is finite for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> a sufficient condition for @xmath44 to be dissipative is that it is positive definite and decreases monotonically with time . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are achieved if @xmath59 and if @xmath60 and @xmath57 are sufficiently smooth function of @xmath11 @xcite . as @xmath59 one </S>",
    "<S> replaces the sum by an integral over @xmath61 weighted by a density of state @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> thus to obtain a finite result in the continuum limit the coupling function @xmath63 and @xmath64 are chosen @xcite as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are constants and @xmath69 is the correlation time of the heat bath . the choice @xmath70 is the simplest one where we assume that every bath mode is excited with the same intensity . </S>",
    "<S> this simple choice makes the relevant term finite for @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently @xmath71 becomes , @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 may be characterized as the cutoff frequency of the bath oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the density of modes @xmath74 of the heat bath is assumed to be lorentzian , @xmath75 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the above assumption resembles broadly the behavior of the hydrodynamical modes in a macroscopic system @xcite . with these forms of @xmath74 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 </S>",
    "<S> we have the expression for @xmath71 as @xmath78 , which reduces to @xmath79 for vanishingly small correlation time @xmath69 and consequently one obtains a @xmath80-correlated noise process .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into consideration of all the above assumptions and assuming that the system variable evolves much more slowly in comparison to the external noise @xmath3 , in the limit @xmath81 , eq.([12 ] ) reduces to @xmath82 ^ 2 \\dot{q}(t ) + f'(q(t ) ) f(t ) + \\gamma \\kappa_0 f(q(t))f'(q(t ) ) \\epsilon ( t),\\ ] ]    where @xmath83 is the dissipation constant and the langevin force @xmath45 is characterized by the statistical properties @xmath84    eq.([19 ] ) is the generalized langevin equation for the system variable . at this juncture , it is noteworthy that for @xmath85 , eq.([19 ] ) reduces to @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> thus for linear system - bath coupling ( i.e. for @xmath85 ) , our hamiltonian given by eq.([1 ] ) may be the starting point for the construction of a langevin equation with both additive and multiplicative noise , which has numerous applications in various field of physics , e.g. phase transition etc . for harmonic potential , </S>",

    "<S> the construction of langevin equation using an effective noise term and an auxiliary function has been done earlier in the configuration space by wu _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite , whereas we have written the langevin equation ( [ 21 ] ) in the phase space . </S>",
    "<S> thus as far as the equation for the evolution of probability density function is concerned , eq.([21 ] ) is the equivalent description of the stochastic differential equation ( [ 19 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([21 ] ) is one of the _ key results _ of this work as it incorporates the effects of thermal noise @xmath45 and the external noise @xmath94 in an unified way even when the underlying noise processes are multiplicative due to the nonlinear system - bath coupling and nonlinear modulation of the heat bath by an external noise . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to mention here that eq.([21 ] ) describes a thermodynamically open system where there is no fluctuation - dissipation relation so that the system will not reach at usual thermal equilibrium , instead , a steady state is attainable for large @xmath95 @xcite . from the computational point of view , generation of a single multiplicative noise process </S>",
    "<S> is much more economical than to generate two separate multiplicative noise processes .    in eq.([21 ] ) the noise is multiplicative and the dissipation is space dependent . in the case of large </S>",
    "<S> dissipation one eliminates the fast variables adiabatically to get a simpler description of the system dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the traditional approach to the elimination of fast variables for multiplicative noise processes does not always give the correct description . in order to get the correct langevin equation in the overdamped limit </S>",

    "<S> the stationary solution of eq.([23 ] ) contains inhomogeneous effective temperature like term , a generalization of boltzmann factor for state dependent diffusion in open system , which arises due to the entanglement of the external driving with the nonlinearity of the system heat bath coupling , a well known effect in several contexts , _ </S>",

    "<S> this makes the effective potential @xmath113 equal to zero so that the numerator of eq.([30 ] ) reduces to zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is no occurrence of current for a periodic potential and periodic derivative of coupling function with same periodicity and hence there is no violation of second law of thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamic consistency based on symmetry consideration ensures the validity of the present formalism . </S>",
    "<S> bttiker @xcite have shown that a overdamped particle subjected to a drift force field with sinusoidal space dependence and also a sinusoidally modulated space dependent diffusion with the same period as the drift experiences a net driving force . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting current depends on the amplitude of the modulation of diffusion and is a periodic function of phase difference between the sinusoidal drift and the sinusoidal modulation of the diffusion .     </S>",
    "<S> variation of current , @xmath114 as a function of phase difference , @xmath115 for different values @xmath116 and for the parameter set @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 . </S>",
    "<S> ]    let us consider that the particle is moving in a sinusoidal symmetric potential of the form @xmath121,\\ ] ]    where @xmath122 is constant and may be taken as barrier height and @xmath115 is the phase factor which can be controlled externally . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling function is chosen as @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the modulation parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we now calculate the current given by eq.([30 ] ) . in fig.1 </S>",
    "<S> the variation of current as a function of phase difference is shown for different values of the coupling constant @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath68 is the perturbation parameter in our analysis we have kept its maximum value low , i.e. , @xmath125 . for the value of the other parameters we have chosen a particular set from the complete parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> an extensive analysis using the full parameter space will be given in our future communication . </S>",
    "<S> the current shown in fig.(1 ) is basically due to the phase difference between the symmetric periodic potential and the space dependent diffusion caused by the nonlinear modulation of the heat bath by external noise . </S>",
    "<S> the current does vanish when the phase difference is either zero or integral multiple of @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> when the heat bath is linearly modulated by external noise source , it is easy to observe that the effective potential @xmath127 is integrable and there will be no asymmetry in the effective potential as the noise in the corresponding langevin equation appears additively and the diffusion coefficient becomes space independent . </S>",
    "<S> thus when the heat bath is driven nonlinearly by the external noise agency there is a net directed motion or phase induced current . </S>",
    "<S> this is because of the fact that when the external noise drives the heat bath nonlinearly the phase bias gives a tilt to the effective potential @xmath127 which makes the transition between left to right and right to left unequal . in fig.2 </S>",
    "<S> we plot the generalized potential @xmath127 for various coupling constant @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase difference ( hence the nonlinear driving of the heat bath ) breaks the detailed balance of the system . when the phase difference is zero or the heat bath is driven linearly there is no net drift velocity . </S>",
    "<S> thus , when we drive the heat bath linearly with @xmath80-correlated external noise , even in presence of phase difference between @xmath8 and @xmath128 there is no net current . for net drift , </S>",
    "<S> apart from phase difference nonlinear driving of the heat bath is required . </S>",
    "<S> this is the _ central result of this paper_.    in conclusion , we have proposed a new microscopic analysis to study the generation of directed motion for a nonlinearly driven heat bath by an external noise . making use of a perturbative treatment </S>",
    "<S> we have derived an effective langevin equation with space dependent dissipation and multiplicative noise . using the corresponding fokker - planck - smoluchowski equation with a space dependent diffusion coefficient </S>",
    "<S> we have checked the thermodynamic consistency condition and have shown that to observe a phase induced current one necessarily needs a nonlinear driving of the heat bath by an external gaussian noise . in our future venture in this direction </S>",
