    "<S> we present a model for the scaling laws of the electric field noise spectral density as a function of the distance , @xmath0 , above a conducting surface . </S>",

    "<S> the predicted scaling laws are in excellent agreement with two different classes of experiments ( cold trapped ions and cantilevers ) , that span at least four orders of magnitude of @xmath0 . according to this model , heating rate in miniature ion traps could be greatly reduced by proper material engineering .    </S>",
    "<S> device miniaturization is a challenge that raises new issues because the scaling laws valid in the macroscopic range might fail , for instance due to the emergence of a new characteristic length . </S>",
    "<S> even the simple case of the electric field in the vicinity of a conductor surface can exhibit anomalous behavior caused by small inhomogeneities of the electric potential on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> these field fluctuations are crucial in the studies of short distance phenomena such as the measurement of the casimir - polder force@xcite , studies of non contact friction@xcite , gravitational forces@xcite and contact potentials@xcite .    in a different context , recent success in quantum information experiment with trapped ions ( see ref  @xcite for a review ) motivated the fabrication of micro - traps in order to fulfill the scalability requirement of a quantum computer@xcite . in such devices </S>",
    "<S> a set of micro - fabricated conducting electrodes generates an oscillating electric field that traps laser - cooled ions in a harmonic potential well , at a distance , @xmath0 , of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation the presence of a fluctuating electric field affects the ion motion inducing a heating , that is usually characterized in term of quanta of vibration gained per unit time . </S>",
    "<S> this heating fixes a limit on the achievable fidelity of ion based quantum gates@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one might try to account for this heating rate by considering typical electric noise sources in conductors , among which the most likely is johnson noise . </S>",
    "<S> however , measured heating rates are orders of magnitude larger than the expected contribution of the johnson noise . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , johnson noise would induce a heating rate that scales as @xmath2 , whereas the observed one is consistent with a @xmath3 scaling@xcite , as would be expected from a random distribution of charges , leading to the notion of patch potentials@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments@xcite suggest that indeed the surface quality plays a dominant role in this anomalous heating . </S>",
    "<S> the observed scaling of the field noise with temperature points out thermally activated phenomena ( surface defaults , charge traps , ... ) . </S>",
    "<S> these effects are easy to probe in the static limit where direct observation of the surface is possible using an atomic force microscope , but much more difficult to observe directly at higher frequencies , which are relevant to ion trapping . </S>",
    "<S> however the measured noise can be compared by assuming a variation as @xmath4 , experimentally verified at room temperature@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the question of finding the electric field fluctuations near an infinite conductor filling half the space has already been extensively treated by considering thermal fluctuations carried by uncorrelated punctual sources ( johnson noise)@xcite . in these models </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic length is given by the skin depth of the material , @xmath5 , at the considered frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of the electric field noise density is then expected to change from @xmath6 for @xmath7 to @xmath8 for @xmath9 where the typical value of @xmath5 for gold electrodes in the @xmath10 range is tens of microns . </S>",
    "<S> however this behavior has not been observed in ion traps experiments where a @xmath3 scaling is reported for @xmath0 varying from @xmath11 to @xmath12@xcite . in a recent work@xcite , </S>",

    "<S> [ [ section ] ]    in this work we present a model where we take explicitly into account the spatial dependence of the electric field noise density above a surface , introducing a characteristic length not yet considered in previous models : the correlation length , @xmath1 , of the noisy potential on the surface . in that picture , </S>",
    "<S> the noise arise from finite size sources distributed randomly on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this simple model accounts for the behavior of electric field noise scaling on the whole range covered by both ion heating measurements and cantilever - based measurements . </S>",

    "<S> an analytical solution of the laplace equation for the special case of a planar ion trap was found@xcite . in the present letter </S>",
    "<S> we extend this approach and obtain an analytical expression for the scaling law of the electric field noise density @xmath18 at a distance @xmath0 of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the first step is to solve the laplace equation for the potential @xmath19 , @xmath20 in half the space ( @xmath21 ) with boundary condition @xmath22 and vanishing potential for @xmath23 . </S>",

    "<S> the horizontal line in equation ( [ eqn : corelfield ] ) means that we average over many configurations of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that the noise on two distinct patches originates from independent random processes with the same temporal correlation function @xmath44 : @xmath45 equation ( [ eqn : corelfield ] ) can then be rewritten : @xmath46(x - u , d , z - v).\\left[\\nabla k\\right](x - u^\\prime , d , z - v^\\prime ) \\label{eqn : coreltfield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the set @xmath47 is disordered one can write : @xmath48 , where the brakets denote an average on the configuration of @xmath31 and @xmath49 is the total number of patches . introducing the spatial correlation function of the patches , @xmath50 , where @xmath1 is the ( finite ) correlation length , we take the temporal fourier transform of @xmath51 : @xmath52(x - u , d , z - v)e^{\\imath(k_x u+k_z v)}\\right|^2 \\label{eqn : first}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 , defined as the fourier transform of @xmath44 , is the potential noise spectral density on the surface and @xmath54 is the two dimensional fourier transform of @xmath55 . after some calculations detailed in the appendix , </S>",

    "<S> we assume an exponential behavior for the spatial autocorrelation function of the patches : @xmath58 this correlation function arises from a poisson voronoi tessellation model of the polycrystalline structure of metals@xcite . more generally , </S>",
    "<S> following the approach of ref @xcite , it can be demonstrated that such an exponential behavior arises from a collection of random potential patches on a surface .    </S>",
    "<S> we can then compute the fourier transform explicitly : @xmath59 , finally giving : @xmath60    equation ( [ eqn : exprnoise ] ) clearly identifies the separate contribution of the spatial and temporal components of the potential noise on the plane to the electric field noise density at a distance @xmath0 of the surface . </S>",

    "<S> [ [ section-1 ] ]    let us now analyze how equation ( [ eqn : exprnoise ] ) applies to both the case of ion traps and cantilevers based experiments . </S>",
    "<S> in planar ion traps , charged particles are trapped above the surface in a tight pseudo - potential and are usually cooled down to the fundamental vibrational state . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a fluctuating electric field leads to the heating of the ion with a heating rate @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the vibrational frequency of the ion ( typically a few @xmath10 ) , @xmath70 is the mass , @xmath71 the charge and @xmath0 the equilibrium position of the ion@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as described in refs@xcite , the experimental measurement of ion heating rate gives thus access to the electric field noise density . </S>",
    "<S> due to electrode configuration in planar ion traps , the ions are trapped at a distance @xmath0 proportional to the size of the electrodes : the field can thus be probed in different ranges ( typically @xmath72~\\mu m$ ] ) using different traps@xcite . although the surface quality ( and thus @xmath1 ) might depend on the fabrication process , a @xmath3 dependence of the heating rate ( or field noise density ) has been observed . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in agreement with the limit @xmath61 of our model .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-2 ] ]    in cantilever based electric field noise measurement , the potential above a surface can be probed on a typical distance range from @xmath73 to @xmath74 , yet on a very different scale from ion traps . </S>",
    "<S> the cantilever is a device with resonant mechanical oscillation frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> its movement is damped by coupling to stray electric fields , with a rate @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the frequency of the cantilever ( typically a few @xmath77 ) and @xmath78 is the induced charge , equal to the tip - sample capacitance , @xmath79 , times the potential bias , @xmath80@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the cantilever oscillations damping rate using optical interferometry gives access to the electric field noise density@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements , in the range @xmath81~nm$ ] , give a @xmath82 scaling of the field noise density , consistent with the limit @xmath63 of our model .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-3 ] ]    as mentioned above , the frequencies probed in ions traps and cantilever based measurement differ by several orders of magnitude , but the measured noise can be scaled to the same frequency , assuming a variation as @xmath4 .    </S>",

    "<S> as reported in refs @xcite , the typical size of static patch potentials on gold surfaces is @xmath98 in excellent agreement with the assumption @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret then the residual spread of the experimental data in terms of different correlation lengths ( in the range @xmath100~\\mu m$ ] ) associated to the sample surface quality , itself highly dependent on the fabrication technique . </S>",
    "<S> the role of surface quality has been noted in ref @xcite , where successive cleaning procedures decreased the measured electric field noise density ( points @xmath92 in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> thus our work shows that in order to compare measured field noise on very different scales , one has to take into account the correlation length of the material and not assume a @xmath3 scaling of the noise , otherwise leading to an over - estimation of the noise at smaller distances . </S>",
    "<S> for example , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fixedzeta ] , our model predicts that for a sample with @xmath101 , the noise at @xmath102 is @xmath103 times greater than noise at @xmath104 ( at the same frequency ) , three orders of magnitude lower than expected with a @xmath3 scaling .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ section-4 ] ]    in conclusion we developed a model for the electric field noise density based on an analytical approach , assuming a finite size of the potentials patches . electrical noise field density </S>",
    "<S> scaling laws predicted by this model are in very good agreement with experimental results , both in the long range regime ( hundred of microns ) , probed with ion traps experiments and in the short range regime ( tens of nanometers ) probed with micro - fabricated cantilevers . </S>",
    "<S> let us point out that the pessimistic @xmath3 scaling law for heating rates observed in trapped ion experiments is over estimated in the short range regime . </S>",
    "<S> moreover even though the noise considered in such devices lies within the @xmath10 range , we find a characteristic length compatible with measurement of static potential patches sizes . </S>",
    "<S> this opens a new possibility to improve the performances of surface micro - traps based on the analysis of electric static noise obtained with atomic force microscopes .    </S>",
