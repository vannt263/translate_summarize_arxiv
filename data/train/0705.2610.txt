    "the existence of cold dark matter in the universe is well  established by recent astrophysical observations .",
    "while the particle nature of dark matter remains a mystery , its effect of promoting structure formation via hierarchical formation of gravitational potential wells from primordial density fluctuations is well  documented in both high resolution n  body simulations and observations of large  scale structure @xcite .",
    "the properties required for a thermally  produced particulate cold dark matter include high mass , lack of strong or electromagnetic couplings , and stability over the lifetime of the universe .",
    "no standard model particle is capable of simultaneously satisfying these demands .",
    "minimal supersymmetry provides a number of viable candidates among its spectrum of fundamental particles @xcite .",
    "the lightest of the four neutralinos , which in models we will consider is also the lightest supersymmetric partner or lsp , consists of various linear combinations of the neutral bino , wino , and higgsino states .",
    "the lsp has been proposed as an excellent candidate not only because of the above properties , but also because the expected cross section gives rise naturally to the observed dark matter mass density during thermal decoupling .",
    "if supersymmetry is to solve the gauge hierarchy problem , it should be broken in such a way that the partner particles attain mass corrections on the order of the electroweak scale , @xmath0 gev .",
    "a weakly - interacting dark matter particle has the correct cross section to produce the observed relic density .",
    "attempts to discover the particle nature of dark matter take on a three  pronged approach . terrestrial experiments to directly detect dark matter particles passing through the earth are underway @xcite , and it is expected that the next generation of particle accelerators will be capable of producing a weakly interacting particle with a mass near the electroweak scale @xcite . in contrast to direct detection and production of dark matter , indirect detection techniques search for the products of dark matter annihilation .",
    "self - annihilations between clustered particles are expected to produce a variety of high - energy cosmic rays , photons , and neutrinos .",
    "sites for these events include the central density spikes of dark matter halos @xcite , diffuse radiation from the halo at large @xcite , substructure within the galactic halo @xcite , and within astronomical bodies such as stars and planets , including our own earth and sun @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the gamma ray flux per energy bin from neutralino annihilations in a region of space requires inputs from two factors , one being the cross section times the expectation value for the number of gammas produced , and the other an astrophysical variable determined by the distance and density profile of the region .",
    "in addition to assuming a supersymmetric model , calculation of the signal from the center of our galaxy requires knowledge about the profile and normalization of the inner halo . on scales larger than about 1 kpc ,",
    "it is well  established through n ",
    "body simulations that the halo has a power  law radial density profile with index -1 to -1.5 @xcite .",
    "frequent gravitational scattering events between dark matter and stars leads to an equilibrium profile of @xmath1 in the inner 2 parsecs @xcite , where dark matter is a negligible proportion of the total mass . since the normalization is indeterminate , as a fiducial model we interpolate inwards from an nfw profile @xcite . while this may be a reasonable assumption ,",
    "it is likely that baryonic compression , in which baryonic matter losing energy through radiative processes falls inward and consequently redistributes dark matter , has increased this number , possibly by several orders of magnitude @xcite . for a weakly  interacting particle of mass greater than 100 gev , it is plausible that a dark matter signal will be observed from the galactic center by the current generation of ground  based gamma ray detection experiments , provided that baryonic compression has increased the central density by at least a modest amount over the fiducial value @xcite , although astrophysical processes could be a potentially troubling background for these searches @xcite .    a recent observation of a tev gamma  ray signal from the galactic center by the h.e.s.s .",
    "atmospheric cherenkov telescope @xcite has motivated this determination of a theoretical upper limit on the mass of neutralino dark matter .",
    "this result was confirmed recently by the magic telescope @xcite .",
    "the signal was also observed previously by the cangaroo ",
    "ii experiment @xcite , though this result was inconsistent with the newer h.e.s.s .",
    "results ; the large flux observed by cangaroo at low energies was not seen by h.e.s.s .",
    "all groups have stated that the signal is consistent with a point source , and h.e.s.s .",
    "and magic agree on a logarithmic slope of about -2.25 . without a clear indication of an annihilating particle , such as line features in the spectrum , or an observation that disfavors an annihilation scenario , such as time variability , the source of the signal remains uncertain , although the extended power law nature of the observed spectrum does not fit well with the expected rollover shape of an annihilation spectrum .",
    "an analysis by the h.e.s.s .",
    "group of their 2004 data , which extended to approximately 30 tev , was unable to find any annihilation spectra which reproduced the observed power law , and they proposed that the signal must be primarily non  dark matter in origin . while the newest data from h.e.s.s . does not seem to be consistent with the annihilation spectrum of either a supersymmetric neutralino or kaluza  klein dark matter particle @xcite , models in which a signal from annihilating dark matter is masked by emissions of astrophysical sources are still possible @xcite .",
    "another analysis of the 2004 data by profumo searched for optimal spectral fits based on final state channels ; it was determined that the dark matter annihilation remains a possible interpretation of the h.e.s.s .",
    "data for a restricted set of final states @xcite . the 2003 h.e.s.s",
    ". data , which extends to 9 tev , can similarly be fitted with fewer constraints on the final states of the annihilating particle .",
    "mambrini and collaborators @xcite searched for a neutralino annihilation spectrum in a non - universal supergravity model which could fit the 2003 data .",
    "they were successful in finding reasonable fits , though none of the points in parameter space for their high mass candidates were consistent with wmap constraints .",
    "possible astrophysical sources of tev gamma ",
    "rays include jets or the shocks in the accretion flow into the central black hole @xcite .",
    "another possibility , which may be ruled out by lack of time variability , is a signal from particles accelerating near the event horizon of a rotating super  massive central black hole @xcite .",
    "while various authors have conducted surveys of supersymmetric parameter space while categorizing dark matter candidates ( e.g. @xcite ) , few papers have explicitly searched for upper mass limits on these candidates .",
    "the effects of coannihilation in a low - energy effective mssm model were considered in @xcite , which calculated the degree to which relic density was reduced by various channels .",
    "we conduct a similar survey , but with the goal of examining the regions of maximal mass in higgsino coannihilation . in @xcite ,",
    "the darksusy software package was used to explore coannihilation in the msugra parameter space . in the chargino coannihilation region ,",
    "the lsp is mostly higgsino , and coannihilates with a nearly  degenerate chargino and second higgsino .",
    "this publication reported a cosmological limit of @xmath21500 gev resulting from chargino coannihilation , which is nearly consistent with our findings for a pure higgsino in this region .",
    "they also examined coannihilations of a bino  type lsp with sleptons and put forth the claim that coannihilation processes do not allow arbitrarily high masses , in contrast to some previous authors .",
    "higgsino dark matter in an msugra framework was also considered in @xcite , where a wmap  favored mass range of approximately 1 tev is found .",
    "type dark matter appears in minimal anomaly",
    " mediated supersymmetry breaking ( mamsb ) models , and has a cosmological mass bound of over 2 tev @xcite .",
    "profumo @xcite looked at several different scenarios , including a mamsb wino , annihilation through a heavy higgs resonance , and qcd effects in gluino annihilations which can allow dark matter masses in the hundreds of tev .",
    "we use a model  independent approach in the calculation of the @xmath3 upper bound , one which could be applicable to many individual supersymmetry  breaking models . to this end , we have used model inputs at the electroweak scale , allowing us to control individual inputs to the mass parameters and compute the dark matter relic density @xmath4 .",
    "calculations were done using the micromegas @xcite and darksusy @xcite software packages .",
    "both of these codes compute susy relic density via a numerical solution of the boltzmann equation , including the cross sections of any relevant coannihilation processes . both programs also provide several options for inputting the supersymmetric particle spectrum , including electroweak and gut - scale minimal inputs , or determining the mass of each particle independently .",
    "micromegas calculates the contribution of individual decay channels to standard model products , as a function of the contribution of each channel to @xmath5 , there being an approximate inverse relationship between the total cross section and final relic density .",
    "darksusy also provides the necessary tools to calculate the flux of high energy gamma ",
    "rays from halo annihilation , as well as a variety of other direct and indirect detection signals .",
    "the density evolution of any particle @xmath6 in the thermal bath of the early universe is governed by the boltzmann equation : @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the cosmological scale factor , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the number density and equilibrium number density of the particle species .",
    "the thermally - averaged cross section @xmath11 must include all channels by which @xmath6 can interact , including coannihilation with other particles , in which the number densities of both species are important . at some point in time",
    "the susy particle will no longer be able to remain in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings ( `` freeze - out '' ) and its co  moving number density will be nearly constant .",
    "we limit ourselves to models which obey a discrete symmetry , r  parity , which prevents decays ( but not two  body scattering ) of susy particles into standard model particles @xcite .",
    "any susy particle other than the lsp in existence at freeze  out will decay to the lsp state .",
    "following the derivation in @xcite , the expression for the present relic density of a dark matter particle in terms of the cross section and freeze  out temperature is @xmath12 here @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the freeze  out temperature , and @xmath15 is the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom of all species contributing to annihilation .",
    "the important features here are that total annihilation cross section controls density , and that mass does not enter the equation except through a weak dependence in @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the wmap survey , when combined with recent observations of large  scale structure , currently provides the best constraints on the quantity @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the ratio of dark matter density to the critical density @xmath19 . for our analysis",
    ", we use the most recent third year wmap data combined with sloan digital sky survey large  scale structure data @xcite to arrive at the tightest constraint on relic density , @xmath20 , here h @xmath21 being the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "we apply bounds equal to twice these 1@xmath22 limits for the following analysis , @xmath23 these limits are sufficient to incorporate other recent measurements of @xmath17 @xcite , which do not differ from our figure by more than @xmath24 .",
    "it should be noted that our results are not particularly sensitive to the relic density constraints , and there are larger sources of error involved in the calculation than the relatively minor variations in experimental determinations of @xmath17 .",
    "the dark matter candidate we address in this paper is the lightest supersymmetric neutralino , denoted @xmath25 , in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . to express the neutralino mass states as a linear combination of higgsino , bino , and neutral wino particle states , we diagonalize the mass matrix .",
    "@xmath26    here @xmath27 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values between the two higgs doublets , @xmath28 is the mass of the @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the weak mixing angle , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gaugino and higgsino mass parameters , respectively .",
    "the physical states then become @xmath34 with @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 1 to 4 is a particle index that will be suppressed in cases where the lsp is being discussed . for our first models , we will be discussing instances in which the lsp is entirely higgsino or wino  like , corresponding to the conditions @xmath37 or @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the masses we are investigating are going to be strictly @xmath39 tev , and the off ",
    "diagonal blocks in the neutralino mass matrix are @xmath40 so mixings are not large , and therefore the mass of the lsp is tightly controlled by the least of the three mass parameters .",
    "the higgsino parameter @xmath33 and su(2 ) parameter @xmath32 also appears in the chargino mass matrix : @xmath41 again , the off diagonal parameters here are small compared to the mass scale of interest .",
    "thus our higgsino and wino  type dark matter models come with a nearly  degenerate chargino ( fermionic partner of charged higgs and w bosons ) built into the model at high energies .",
    "this chargino will account for a large degree of the total annihilation cross section for these two dark matter types .",
    "incidentally , because we are interested in high  mass dark matter , @xmath39 tev , we will not be addressing the possibility of bino  type dark matter in this paper . because there is no degenerate chargino state in this case , the total annihilation cross sections and mass limits on bino dark matter tend to be much lower than the other two varieties , even with strong coannihilation from sfermionic particles .",
    "to explore cases in which the lsp is a pure wino or higgsino , all susy masses are set to high values ( @xmath42 tev ) except for either the higgsino or su(2 ) ( wino ) mass parameter .",
    "the other relevant particle which appears in this situation is a slightly heavier chargino , and in the higgsino case a second nearly degenerate higgsino  type neutralino .",
    "as the other particles are at a significantly higher mass scale , they will be thermally suppressed prior to dark matter freeze  out and will not affect relic density .",
    "our results for this particular region show a monotonically increasing relic density with increasing mass , with no dependence on the @xmath43 parameter .",
    "our bounds from combined wmap and sdss for these cases are : @xmath44    our mass limit for a pure wino state is consistent with that mentioned by profumo @xcite , who quoted a function @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .      in",
    "ordered to systematically test the effects of coannihilation with a higgsino , we tested each sfermion mass parameter , originally set to high values , by shifting them down to the coannihilation region , to a mass @xmath48 which is slightly larger than @xmath33 .",
    "beginning with the limits set by higgsino ",
    "chargino coannihilation , we attempt to find regions where these processes allow a larger higgsino mass by increasing the effective cross section for annihilation .",
    "depending on the specific interaction strengths for processes involving this new particle , the relic density may be increased or decreased as @xmath48 is brought lower , that is , coannihilation may have a positive or negative effect on the mass limit . in our low ",
    "energy effective supersymmetric model the sfermion masses are all free parameters . for our notation",
    "we write @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , with i = 1,2,3 being the generation index , for the left ",
    "handed squark doublet , right",
    " handed up and down singlets , left  handed slepton doublet , and right  handed slepton singlet , respectively .",
    "this gives 15 free mass parameters to examine in this coannihilation calculation .",
    "using micromegas and confirming our results with darksusy , we determine that only coannihilation with the third generation of squarks allows the higgsino mass to be increased beyond the amounts in the previous section while conforming to experimental limits .",
    "this is shown graphically here in figure [ fig : coannihilation_contours ] , which show regions in @xmath48@xmath33 space that fall within the @xmath54 bounds on relic density .",
    "for these figures , all masses other than @xmath33 and @xmath48 are set to 50 tev . at this mass",
    "these particles are effectively removed from the early  universe boltzmann equation , as their number densities are exponentially suppressed prior to freeze  out .",
    "the ratio of higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath43 is set to 30 , and the supersymmetry breaking parameters @xmath55 are set to 0 .",
    "no other sfermion increases the maximum higgsino mass when allowed to coannihilate .",
    "also , the effect of coannihilation with two or more sfermions is not found to be cumulative in general . when @xmath56 , bringing down any other mass either increases @xmath17 or has a negligable effect .",
    "we did not find any cases in which compound coannihilation with several sfermions had a substantially effect on the mass bound .",
    "the ratio of higgs doublet vacuum expectation values @xmath57 has a significant effect in the sfermion coannihilation region .",
    "our previous analysis was done with a typical value of @xmath58 , but , with a higher value , the effects of coannihilation are increased .",
    "third generation sfermion right  hand singlet parameters u3 and d3 can also have a slight enhancement effect in this regime .",
    "the optimal combination is found to be @xmath59 . in this case , @xmath60 may grow as large as 1.8 tev while remaining within experimental density bounds .",
    "this is the greatest mass which was possible under any combination of coannihilating sfermions in our higgsino scenario .    for a wino  type lsp ,",
    "no sfermion coannihilation arrangement was found to have the effect of raising the mass bound ; all sfermion coannihilation schemes cause the mass limit to decrease .",
    "therefore the highest mass limit for this type of dark matter is that found in the previous section .",
    "another mechanism through which the annihilation cross section of a neutralino lsp might be greatly enhanced is via a heavy higgs resonance , @xmath61 . at the multi  tev scale , the masses of the heavy cp  even higgs , cp ",
    "odd higgs , and charged higgs are all approximately degenerate .",
    "@xmath62    under this arrangement , not only is the cross section of lsp annihilation enhanced by the resonance , but so are coannihilations between any nearly degenerate charginos or next to lightest neutralinos . it is expected that the cross section will be dominated by the cp  odd higgs channel , as the contribution from cp  even higgses vanish in the low velocity limit due to the requirement of cp conservation in the intermediate state @xcite .",
    "profumo @xcite analyzed this region of parameter space in minimal supergravity ( msugra ) and anomaly  mediated ( mamsb ) susy breaking models with non - universal higgs masses .",
    "he found upper lsp mass limit of approximately 5 and 12 tev for msugra and mamsb , respectively , utilizing @xmath63 wmap bounds and @xmath64 . we have followed a similar program , taking the low  energy neutralino and chargino mass matrix inputs as free parameters , with the aforementioned constraint on the lsp mass , therefore exploring over the vector space of neutralino and chargino mixings .",
    "for two multi  tev neutralinos interacting at zero velocity , the cross section for annihilation through a cp ",
    "odd higgs is @xcite , @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the vertex factors for the coupling between the higgs and neutralino and final  state fermion species @xmath68 , respectively , and @xmath69 is the higgs width . the vertex factors appearing in a neutralino  higgs or chargino  higgs junction involve products of gaugino and higgsino mixing factors , and are therefore sensitive to the exact choice of mass parameters . for two neutralino lsps annihilating through a cp",
    " odd higgs , we have @xcite    @xmath70    where the lsp composition is denoted by parameters a through d as in equation [ neutmix ] . here ` u ' refers to up  type quarks and neutrinos , and ` d ' refers to down type quarks and charged leptons , and g and g are the su(2 ) and u(1 ) coupling constants . because the @xmath71 vertex factor is determined by products of gaugino and higgsino fractions , the largest factors and highest annihilation enhancements",
    "tend to occur when the neutralino is an even mixture of gaugino and higgsino particle eigenstates . as derived in @xcite , the maximum cross section for the cp ",
    "odd higgs channel is at @xmath72 ; our investigation of different values for @xmath43 found the highest mass limits at approximately this point .",
    "our results for this type of model can be seen in figure [ fig : schan ] .",
    "we systematically calculated mass limits corresponding to the upper @xmath54 experimental bound over a large number of neutralino mixtures .",
    "this was done by setting @xmath73 , and scanning over values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these differences alter the particle state content of the lsp via the neutralino mass matrix .",
    "the final results are shown in terms of the fractional lsp composition .",
    "as @xmath43 is also an independent , relevant parameter , we included this as a variable and searched from @xmath43 = 2 to 50 .",
    "the results from this scan are plotted as mass contours as a function of fractional neutralino composition .",
    "we show plots for 3 values of @xmath43 in figure [ fig : schan ] .",
    "for each of the model types thus discussed , we have calculated the resulting local gamma  ray flux from annihilations in the galactic center . for our halo model",
    ", we utilized the predictions of @xcite , together with their fiducial value for the density normalization at the maximum radius of the central black hole s sphere of influence , @xmath2 2pc .",
    "this factor is highly uncertain and it is possible that it has been increased by baryonic infall .",
    "dark matter annihilation can also have an effect on the density profile of the innermost part of the cusp , changing the signal intensity by a multiplier refered to as the boost parameter @xcite , an effect not considered here .",
    "a reader wishing to use a different normalization can simply raise or lower our flux measurements by the square of the normalization multiplier , or by the boost factor in the case of modifications to the inner halo profile .",
    "the total cross sections for all annihilations to continuous and line features in the spectrum were calculated using the darksusy program . in order to show a typical spectrum as seen by a detector , we have folded the distribution with a gaussian with an energy width of 15 percent , as was done in @xcite .",
    "this also allows a reasonable visual comparison to be made of the prominence of the line emission feature against the continuous output .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dmodflux ] we show the gamma ray flux from 5 different models , corresponding to the scenarios we have discussed .",
    "clearly , with the fiducial halo normalization none of these annihilation models can account for a significant fraction of the flux observed by the h.e.s.s . telescopes and confirmed by magic . however , the highly uncertain contribution to the central density from baryonic compression has not been taken into account in these results .",
    "as flux increases quadratically with particle density , a rather modest compression factor of 10 would increase flux by 2 orders of magnitude , enough to bring our more strongly annihilating models to the levels observed by these atmospheric cherenkov telescopes .",
    "however , the h.e.s.s . data also maintains an approximate power  law profile for 2 logarithmic decades , something that none of our models can reproduce even with a carefully adjusted density normalization .",
    "even the most massive particles we found to be capable of satisfying relic density constraints exhibit a roll  off behavior that is not in the observed spectrum .",
    "two plots for the annihilation through a heavy higgs resonance are shown .",
    "we have chosen a mass of 20 tev here , the heaviest neutralino for which a cross section could be computed without resorting to extrapolation in certain darksusy routines .",
    "because mean halo velocities are much lower than those at freeze  out , annihilation cross sections are more sensitive in the halo to the exact relation between @xmath76 and @xmath60 as there is little smearing out of the center  of  mass energy due to thermal velocities . thus models that yield similar relic densities can have very different halo annihilation cross sections . to illustrate this we have displayed both an optimized model ( orange ) with @xmath77 and a more typical model ( purple ) where the relation is only approximate .",
    "higgsino and wino  type dark matter annihilate much more strongly than bino dark matter at a given mass , and are capable of satisfying relic density constraint with masses at the tev scale , something that is not possible with a bino particle , even including sfermion coannihilations .",
    "primarily higgsino - type dark matter can arise , for example , in the ` focus point ' region of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the supersymmetric scalar quarks and leptons are set to high masses by a single gut scale parameter , and the neutralino becomes a higgsino - bino mixture . as this scalar mass term",
    "is increased , the neutralino lsp becomes more higgsino  like , and features an increasing cross section @xcite .",
    "since the highest mass lsps in the focus point region are nearly pure higgsino , we have constrained this and other higgsino - type models by considering this limiting case .",
    "dark matter which is predominantly wino ",
    "type appears in minimal anomaly  mediated supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "micromegas provides information on the annihilation channels relevant to the total lsp cross section in a particular model . for the case of higgsino  chargino coannihilation , a large number of channels provide modest contributions to the total cross section .",
    "chargino and neutralino annihilation to quarks are the most important processes , with annihilations to leptons and gauge bosons , and double chargino annihilation to quarks being the other relevant channels . in the @xmath78tev mass range of interest ,",
    "even the heaviest standard model particles are essentially massless , and there is little difference in available phase space between different generations , hence little variation in cross section .",
    "not surprisingly , there is also relatively little variation in channel contributions as the mass scale and resulting relic density are altered .",
    "the introduction of a coannihilating squark opens the possibility of tree  level annihilations to gluons .",
    "annihilations to gluons , as well as coannihilations between higgsinos and squarks to quarks and gauge bosons , are the major new channels available . the decreased mass of a given sfermion increases the t  channel amplitude for scattering from neutralinos to fermions , but only for that particular flavor of the sfermion .",
    "these same vertices explain why the third generation of squarks are unique as the only effective set of coannihilating partners .",
    "the appearance of the corresponding quark mass terms limits these channels to cases involving heavy quark masses .",
    "the quantity @xmath27 appears in several vertex factors involving higgs and higgsino iterations with matter @xcite .",
    "processes with a factor of @xmath43 or @xmath79 in the amplitude include chargino and neutralino annihilation with a sfermion to a gauge boson and fermion , and these are primarily responsible for the decrease in relic density in scenarios with squark coannihilation with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "an effect which is relevant for higgsino and wino models is the sommerfeld enhancement , appearing in the context of weakly  interacting non ",
    "relativistic particles with a mass much greater than the w  boson .",
    "this non  perturbative effect has been shown to decrease relic abundance by as much as 50@xmath80 for a wino  type lsp and 10@xmath80 for a higgsino  type @xcite .",
    "these authors study wino dark matter as an example and find upper wmap bounds of 2.7 to 3 tev .",
    "neither darksusy nor micromegas accounts for this effect ; in addition to these considerably higher new bounds for wino dark matter , our bounds involving pure higgsino dark matter could be enhanced by a slight amount .    when annihilation through a heavy higgs s  channel resonance is considered , allowed masses can go into the tens of tev .",
    "the examination of this scenario was done using the darksusy software . as expected , the neutralinos which had the largest cross section were approximately even mixtures of higgsino and gaugino states . from figure",
    "[ fig : schan ] , it is clear that there is little change in the general topography of the relation between neutralino mixture and mass bounds with changing @xmath43 .",
    "the maximum mass limits do change as a function of @xmath43 , rising a small amount from 32 tev at @xmath81 to about 34 tev at @xmath82 5 to 8 , and then decreasing from that point down to 18 tev at @xmath83 .",
    "our results with micromegas were tested against the darksusy code , and the programs were found to generally be in agreement over the parameter space of interest , except in the case of annihilation through a higgs resonance . for our calculations involving pure higgsino and wino states , the difference in relic density calculations were no larger than 2.5 percent , and in certain cases where sfermion coannihilation was considered it was no greater than 9 percent . it was noted during while investigating sfermion coannihilation that the two codes produced highly disparate results in certain situations .",
    "these problems were determined to be a error in the darksusy software that only appears at mass scales higher than we have considered here , and did not appear to be an issue for our results in the coannihilation region . for the higgs resonance models",
    ", there was a significant difference in the predictions of the two codes , sometimes by as large as a factor of 2 .",
    "the darksusy results , which we have presented , tended to output higher mass limits than micromegas .",
    "while this does mean that our results in this area should be taken only as approximate , our conclusion that this scenario is unlikely and can not explain current gamma ray observations is not altered .    while there is no concrete upper bound on the scale of supersymmetry breaking , a mass well into the tev range is certainly disfavored by constraints from gauge coupling unification @xcite .",
    "another ` absolute ' bound comes from partial wave unitarity , which provides an upper limit on the mass that any thermally produced dark matter particle can have , by placing a constraint on the cross section in equation [ [ boltzdiff ] ] .",
    "this bound is applicable as long as the annihilation cross section arises primarily from s  wave terms .",
    "the mass limit set by unitarity is @xmath84 @xcite , which leads to a maximum relic density of about 120 tev .",
    "while this mass is well above that of any of the mssm models we examined , it may become important when considering thermally  produced heavy dark matter candidates from other particle physics extensions to the standard model .",
    "however , it should be noted that the unitarity bound can be violated in the case of a strong resonance , in which the assumption of s  wave dominance breaks down @xcite .",
    "another case in which the unitarity bound is not applicable comes from possible non  perturbative factors in the annihilation cross section which could affect heavy ( @xmath78500 gev ) higgsino - type neutralinos @xcite .",
    "these factors appear only at low velocity and would not affect the physics of the dark matter during freeze  out but could thus affect halo interactions , greatly increasing flux levels from annihilations .",
    "the mass limits we have set in this paper apply only to neutralino dark matter in the mssm model which attains a relic density through thermal freeze  out in a standard cosmology .",
    "we can make no claims about cases in which the dark matter is produced through non ",
    "thermal processes .",
    "these could include scenarios in which the dark matter is produced non  thermally , possibly by a late  decaying scalar field @xcite , or one in which entropy is produced after freeze  out .",
    "this latter case could happen for a variety of reasons ( @xcite , for review ) and would have the effect of violating the standard assumption of constant comoving entropy density , which would reduce relic density .",
    "the unitarity bound would not apply in this situation , as a very massive dark matter particle with ordinary cross section could still attain the correct density today .",
    "we have determined the masses of pure higgsino and wino ",
    "type thermally  produced dark matter which are consistent with the latest density constraints on dark matter , defined here as twice the 1@xmath22 bound determined by combined sdss and wmap3 data . in the absence of any coannihilation processes with scalar fermions , the suitable mass range is found to be between 0.99 and 1.12 tev for a pure higgsino and 2.10 and 2.38 for a pure wino state .",
    "coannihilation with partners of the 3rd  generation quarks is found to increase this limit modestly for higgsino type dark matter to an upper limit of about 1.80 tev , with fine tuning in the mass parameters and @xmath43 , but no coannihilation model can increase the mass limit for a wino  type particle . allowing the dark matter to exist as a bino pure or mixed state tends to sharply decrease mass limits , and bino mass limits",
    "were always found to be in the sub  tev range .",
    "the other class of models which we examined utilized annihilation of the lsp through a heavy higgs resonance .",
    "viable models with lsp masses as high as 34 tev were found , though these scenarios are sensitive to the both the neutralino mixture and the resonance condition @xmath77 , and are therefore dependent on fine  tuning . a computation of the vhe gamma ray spectrum which could be observed with an atmospheric cherenkov telescope showed that even the largest masses we found are not adequate for fitting the observed h.e.s.s spectrum .",
    "this observed event rate is also considerably higher than our predictions , although this is not necessarily a problem because of uncertain normalization of the dark matter profile in its innermost regions .",
    "the author wishes to thank joel primack , patrick fox , andreas birkedal , gordon kane , and stefano profumo for advice and guidance .",
    "this project would not have been possible without the micromegas and darksusy teams , and in particular fawzi boudjema and genevieve belanger from the former , and paolo gondolo , joakim edsjo , and edward baltz from the latter , who provided assistance on various issues .",
