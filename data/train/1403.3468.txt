    "this paper is motivated by an intriguing question posed in the excellent collection of physics problems @xcite , based on an exam problem from the prestigious moscow institute of physics and technology `` phys - tech '' .",
    "imagine a long ruler made of metal , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ruler ] .",
    "we apply voltage @xmath0 v to its corners @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and 1 cm away from the edge we find the voltage difference between points @xmath3 and @xmath4 to be @xmath5 v ( @xmath6 cm ) .",
    "the question is how the voltage difference behaves further down the ruler .",
    "the thickness of the ruler is neglected so the problem is two - dimensional .     and @xmath2 , and as a result 0.1 v is measured between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "what is the voltage difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 as a function of their distance from the edge @xmath9?,width=480 ]    it seems we can reproduce this situation in reality .",
    "however , note that the real current leads always have a finite extension area ( or , in the idealized 2d situation , a finite length ) of contact and are never point - like . in fact , we will see below that the original problem can not be solved . however , it is a very inspiring problem that can be reformulated and used to illustrate the important mathematical technique of conformal mapping @xcite in an intuitive setting .",
    "it can also be used to illustrate the concept of renormalization @xcite , where microscopic details of the system are not known but predictions of relationships among macroscopic measurements are possible .",
    "the electric potential @xmath10 and the density of current @xmath11 flowing in the ruler are related by ohm s law : the current flows along the gradient of the potential ( in an isotropic medium ) and the proportionality coefficient is the conductivity @xmath12 , @xmath13 away from the contact points @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the current is conserved , @xmath14 , so , inside the ruler , the potential satisfies the laplace equation , @xmath15 what is the behavior of @xmath10 near the contact point @xmath1 ? consider a small circle around @xmath1 with the radius @xmath16 much less than the width of the ruler .",
    "since the current is conserved , its density is inversely proportional to the radius of the circle , @xmath17 .",
    "we see that @xmath11 has a pole at @xmath1 ( as well as at @xmath2 ) , and the potential has logarithmic singularities at those points . for this reason",
    "the problem can not be solved as originally formulated : if the potential difference at the source @xmath18 is finite , the current can not flow and is zero everywhere , and so is the potential difference between any points further along the ruler , like @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the potential difference @xmath19 at some distance from the source is non - zero , the source voltage @xmath18 must be infinite .",
    "in the remainder of this section we will find the potential distribution inside the ruler , assuming infinite @xmath18 .",
    "in the following section we will use this result to reformulate the problem and make it solvable .",
    "the current does not flow across the edges of the ruler , so along the edges the component of the current density perpendicular to the edge vanishes .",
    "this is the boundary condition that @xmath10 must satisfy : the gradient of @xmath10 must not have components perpendicular to the edges .",
    "this boundary problem is much easier to solve a simpler geometry , so we use a conformal mapping to map the ruler into an infinite half - plane .",
    "we introduce a complex variable @xmath20 as a coordinate in the ruler : point @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ruler ] ) is at the origin @xmath21 and the scale is chosen such that point @xmath1 is at @xmath22 .",
    "if we consider any ( twice differentiable ) function of @xmath23 , its real and imaginary components automatically fulfill the laplace equation ( see the appendix ) .",
    "we now introduce a new complex variable @xmath24 .",
    "an important property of such complex mapping is that it preserves angles ( see the appendix ) .",
    "if we find a potential @xmath25 whose equipotential lines are perpendicular to the images of the ruler boundaries in the mapping @xmath26 , the function @xmath27 will be automatically the correct solution of our problem in the more complicated geometry of the ruler itself .    the image of the ruler under @xmath28 is shown if fig .",
    "[ fig : rulerimage ] : the current sources @xmath1 and @xmath2 are mapped onto two points on the @xmath29 axis , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the long edges of the ruler are mapped onto the infinite parts of the @xmath29 axis : the upper edge onto the negative part @xmath32 and the lower one onto the positive part @xmath33 .",
    "we now see the advantage of using the map @xmath26 : since the sources lie on the @xmath34 axis , any function that depends only on the distances from these sources is symmetric with respect to a reflection in that axis , and lines of its constant real or imaginary part can intersect that axis only at right angles .    .",
    "if the ruler extended to infinity both to the right and to the left , its image would be the whole upper half - plane im@xmath35 .",
    "the additional , left - hand side half of the ruler would all be mapped onto the unit semicircle around the origin .",
    "the curved edge of the semicircle is the image of the edge @xmath9 of the ruler .",
    "the imaginary @xmath36 axis is the image of the horizontal symmetry axis of the ruler , im@xmath37.,width=480 ]    the horizontal line dividing the original plate in half ( @xmath38 ) is mapped onto the positive imaginary semi - axis .",
    "@xmath39 corresponds to @xmath40 .",
    "the solution of the laplace equation is @xmath41 the overall normalization @xmath3 depends on the amount of current flowing into the ruler and the conductivity .",
    "we will discuss its determination below .",
    "as we have already noticed , this solution , by symmetry , satisfies the boundary condition that the gradient of the potential at the boundaries of the semi - infinite plate should have no component perpendicular to the boundary ( since no current flows through the boundary ) . in the @xmath42 plane",
    "this is satisfied by .",
    "namely , equipotential lines form some closed figures around @xmath43 and @xmath44 , symmetric with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "this shows that they are orthogonal to the upper and lower plates .",
    "( it is less obvious that they are also orthogonal to the vertical edge of the plate which is mapped onto a semicircle connecting @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "but they must be , by symmetry ( in the @xmath23-plane ) between the right and the left halves of the infinite plate @xmath48 . )",
    "all we now need is to express @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ semiinfplate : potinw ] ) by the original @xmath51 , @xmath52 we find @xmath53 and the voltage difference between the upper and the lower edge ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) is@xmath56 we see that far from the edge the voltage drops exponentially and that the exponent does not depend on the resistivity .",
    "what sets the scale is the width of the plate ( taken here as the unit of length ) .",
    "we now express the normalization constant @xmath3 in terms of the current flowing into the ruler . to this end , consider the potential near the origin @xmath57 , @xmath58 the resulting current density is @xmath59 relating the normalization @xmath3 to the total current @xmath60 flowing through the ruler , @xmath61      suppose the current is supplied to a ruler by contacts that wrap around the corners of the ruler near points @xmath1 and @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ruler ] .",
    "we assume the length of the contacts to be a small fraction @xmath62 of the width @xmath9 , @xmath63 . in order to find the resistance between such finite contacts , we divide the ruler into a tiny part between the contact and a quarter - circle of similar size ( an equipotential line in case of point - like contacts ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contact ] .        the resistance between the contacts",
    "is dominated by the bulk of the ruler between the quarter - circles at both corners ; for @xmath63 , it behaves like @xmath64 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : corner ] ) ) .",
    "the quarter - circles themselves have all dimensions on the order of @xmath62 , so their resistance adds only a constant term to that logarithm and can be treated as a subleading correction .",
    "we thus see that the voltage @xmath18 applied to the corners is related to the current flowing through the ruler by @xmath65 where , in the limit @xmath63 , @xmath66 is a constant dependent only on the detailed geometry of the contacts but not their size .",
    "it is convenient to express the normalization constant of the potential distribution by the applied voltage , @xmath67 so that the voltage difference between points on the upper and lower edge of the ruler at the distance @xmath68 from the left edge is @xmath69 for simplicity , from now on , we assume that the distances from the left edge of the ruler are sufficiently large for the simple asymptotic formula to be valid ( this is true for @xmath68 much larger than about a third of the ruler width ) , @xmath70 we now want to use the voltage difference measured at some distance @xmath71 ( @xmath72 equals to the dimensionless ratio @xmath73 in fig .  [",
    "fig : ruler ] ) , @xmath74 to express the voltage difference at another point at a dimensionless distance @xmath68 from the edge , @xmath75 we see that just knowing the source voltage @xmath18 and one voltage @xmath19 at some distance from the edge is not sufficient to determine it at other distances .",
    "the reason is that there are three unknowns : the width of the ruler @xmath76 , the size of the contact , and the voltage distribution .",
    "@xmath18 has the character of an `` unrenormalized '' quantity whose relationship to physical quantities like @xmath77 depends on the microscopic details of the contacts , parameterized by @xmath62 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , if we instead know two voltages measured at some distances away from the edge , say @xmath78 , we can find the voltage distribution everywhere ( away from the origin ) .",
    "this is because the voltages away from the source depend on one universal combination of the applied voltage and the details of contacts .",
    "a new information has been added without increasing the number of given parameters .",
    "this leads us to the new formulation of the problem .",
    "if the measured voltage is given at two pairs of points along the ruler , like @xmath79 and @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ruler ] , it can be found everywhere else .",
    "we use the notation @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ; and the distances are expressed in terms of the width , @xmath84 .",
    "we then have @xmath85 it remains to eliminate the unknown width of the ruler using the two given voltages , @xmath86 and finally @xmath87 we have been able to eliminate the unknown microscopic parameters of the problem in terms of the measured macroscopic quantities .",
    "it seems that an analytical solution ( [ eq:4 ] ) in terms of @xmath88 is only possible if the asymptotic formula ( [ eq : asymp ] ) is valid for @xmath89 .",
    "otherwise the transcendental equations resulting from ( [ eq : full ] ) have to be solved numerically or geometrically .",
    "we now want to compare our study with the solution proposed in @xcite .",
    "the starting point there is a comparison of potential differences @xmath77 at two nearby pairs of points along the ruler , @xmath90 which is certainly true as long as the coefficient @xmath91 is a function of @xmath68 .",
    "it is then argued that since the ruler is semi - infinite , @xmath92 is a constant independent of the position ( as if all points had the same properties ) .",
    "this seems to be wrong , since the ruler is only _",
    "semi_-infinite , so points closer to the left edge are really different from points further down",
    ". however , the differential equation thus obtained , @xmath93 is also satisfied by our asymptotic solution ( [ eq : asymp ] ) .",
    "this is because for @xmath94 ( points far away from the beginning of the ruler ) , the dependence of @xmath91 on @xmath68 becomes very weak .    if one treats the equation ( [ eq:6 ] ) as valid exactly everywhere , one gets the ( incorrect ) solution @xmath95 but is this really incorrect ?",
    "after all , it seems to agree with ( [ eq:4 ] ) if we set there @xmath96 .",
    "the point is that ( [ eq:4 ] ) is _ not valid _ unless @xmath97 ; it was derived using the asymptotic formula ( [ eq : asymp ] ) .",
    "so , one can not study the limit @xmath96 with that equation .",
    "consider two rulers , one with the width @xmath98 mm , another with @xmath99 mm , as are typically used in classroom and in the mechanical shop .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : full ] ) to adjust contact parameters , @xmath100 , to ensure that 1  v supplied to points a and b ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ruler ] ) results in 0.1  v measured 1 cm away from the edge .",
    "we find @xmath101 , @xmath102 .    now , using again eq .",
    "( [ eq : full ] ) , we can determine the voltage difference measured at any distance away from the left edge .",
    "choose the distance equal 20 mm , that is twice the distance where 0.1  v was measured .",
    "in the broader ruler we find @xmath103 v , and in the narrower @xmath104 v.    for comparison , the incorrect formula ( [ eq:7 ] ) gives in both cases 0.01 v , independent of the width .",
    "it is accidental that this result is numerically close to that for the 13 mm ruler . for an even narrower one , with @xmath105 mm , eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) still gives 0.01 v , while the correct result is 0.004 v.",
    "somewhat surprisingly the problem of finding the voltage distribution in a long ruler has turned out to involve some interesting mathematics and physics .",
    "we have seen that the solution can be found using a conformal mapping .",
    "the procedure is so simple and intuitive that it can be used as a pedagogical illustration of this powerful method of complex analysis .",
    "the exact solution with point - like contacts has logarithmic singularities .",
    "these are regularized when finite size of contacts is taken into account .",
    "finally , we have found that relationships among measurements away from the contacts can be expressed without reference to the microscopic details , in a way analogous to the renormalization .    a solution for a very long ruler , to which the voltage is applied in the middle , rather than at one end , is trivially obtained from the one presented here .",
    "* acknowledgments : * i thank alexander penin and mikhail voloshin for helpful discussions .",
    "this research was supported by science and engineering research canada ( nserc ) .",
    "we need two properties of the complex mapping @xmath106 in the present analysis : it is conformal , that is preserving angles at which curves intersect ; and it preserves the form of the laplace equation .",
    "the first property follows from @xmath26 being a differentiable function ; that is , its derivative @xmath107 does not depend on the direction at which @xmath23 is approached . to see this ,",
    "consider the three points @xmath108 and their images @xmath109 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : conformalangles ] .",
    "we want to show that the two angles @xmath110 and @xmath111 are equal .",
    "the points @xmath112 are infinitesimally close to @xmath113 , and for simplicity we choose them to be at equal distance @xmath114 from @xmath113 .",
    "the angle @xmath110 is just the difference of phase of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , @xmath117 the angle @xmath111 is found by expanding @xmath118 in a taylor series ; only one term of the expansion suffices since the points are infinitesimally close : @xmath119 where we have used the independence of the derivative from the direction .    regarding the laplace equation , it is satisfied by any ( twice - differentiable ) function of a complex variable @xmath20 , @xmath120    { \\dd^2f \\over \\dd z^2 }    = 0,\\ ] ] since @xmath121 .",
    "any twice - differentiable mapping @xmath122 preserves this property ."
