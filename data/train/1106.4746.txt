    "determination of the eigenspectrum of the helmholtz equation for different boundary conditions and geometries has been a long standing problem both in physics and in engineering .",
    "a particular class of the problem relates to finding out the eigenvalues when the corresponding eigenfunctions satisfy the dirichlet or the neumann condition on the boundary .",
    "in fact , one can also have mixed type of boundary conditions , although it comes up less frequently in practical situations than the previous two cases .",
    "the problem has been pursued in different contexts in physics and in engineering .",
    "hence , the importance of solving the helmholtz equation for different boundary conditions can hardly be overemphasized .",
    "the standard wave equation that one encounters once too often in different realms of theoretical and applied physics reduces to the helmholtz equation after one separates out the temporal part . for instance , the canonical example where one deals with the wave equation is the vibration of membranes and plates .",
    "the problem crops up often even in acoustic and in mechanical engineering .",
    "perhaps the best known example of the neumann boundary condition is the analysis of the propagation of the te modes in a waveguide .",
    "another common example ( in 1 dimension ) is that of heat conduction through a rod when energy is supplied at one of its ends at a constant rate .",
    "examples of the dirichlet boundary condition include the propagation of the tm modes of electromagnetic waves within a waveguide and the vibration of membranes .",
    "however , in all these cases simple analytic solutions are available only for a very restricted class of boundary geometry . in general",
    "obtaining a solution to the problem for an arbitrary boundary can be a formidable task .",
    "however , many physical situations require that we solve the equation on a general domain .",
    "in particular , the design of waveguides with a cross - section perturbed from a square may turn out to be useful in eliminating the losses due to the corners .",
    "the same problem presents itself , although in a different guise , in quantum mechanics where one solves the schrdinger equation to find out the energy states of a particle confined by an infinite potential well in 2 dimensions and enforces the dirichlet condition on the boundary of the well .",
    "a variant of the same problem is the study of quantum billiards which , however , involves more subtleties .",
    "another area which has witnessed a flurry of activities of late is the study of quantum dots .",
    "the dots are usually taken to have a circular symmetry .",
    "but in practice that can hardly be guaranteed .",
    "there are bound to be small departures from exact circular symmetry . in such a scenario",
    "a very natural extension is to consider the confining region to be a supercircle @xcite and investigate the resulting spectrum .",
    "recently , bera _ et al _ @xcite have proposed a perturbative approach to the problem where the correction terms were given by a power series expansion and the method was applied for the supercircular boundaries .",
    "this then calls for a programme to solve the helmholtz equation for a general boundary .",
    "et al _ @xcite suggested a general recipe which was in the same spirit of bera but furnished the perturbative corrections in a closed form for the case of the dirichlet condition . on a more optimistic note , we can even attempt to proceed the other way round and expect that a knowledge of a part of the spectrum may offer an window to probe the exact shape of the dots .",
    "in fact , attempts have already been made exploring these issues @xcite .",
    "the question _ ` can one hear the shape of a drum ? ' _ was first posed by kac as an inverse eigenvalue problem to the helmholtz equation @xcite . in the context of quantum mechanics",
    "this implies whether a knowledge of the energy states of a particle confined in a 2 dimensional infinite well is enough to shed light upon the boundary of the well .",
    "a counter - example was constructed by gordon _ et al _ @xcite who gave a pair of isospectral but non - congruent domains .",
    "however , by exploiting the _ inside - outside _ duality of quantum billiard problems @xcite it has been shown recently that the shape of isospectral billiards can indeed be inferred by studying the exterior neumann scattering problems @xcite .",
    "thus , considering its immense applicability , it is not surprising that the problem of solving the helmholtz equation attracts the attention of physicists even today .",
    "however , the problem , both in its classical and quantum incarnations , is amenable to exact analytic treatment only in some special cases .",
    "such problems are generally tackled by invoking the method of separation of variables in a suitably chosen coordinate system . thus rectangular and circular boundaries can easily be handled .",
    "the case of the triangular boundary is more involved @xcite .",
    "the problem of elliptical boundary , though solvable in principle , is quite non trivial .",
    "this is because in elliptical coordinates the separation of variables leads to the mathieu equation whose solutions are the mathieu functions .",
    "mathieu functions have a 2-parameter dependence which makes them quite complicated to handle .",
    "for any other sort of boundary we virtually run out of a suitable choice of coordinate system .",
    "the problem becomes even more untraceable for boundaries having no simple geometrical shape .",
    "this is a major handicap for an analytical study of the ` irregular boundary ' problem .",
    "an alternative way then is to estimate the eigenvalues by numerical means .",
    "in fact , till now , most of the efforts at finding out the eigenvalues of the helmholtz equation for an irregular boundary have been along this direction @xcite .",
    "the analytical aspect , however , has not received much attention except for some occasional attempts .",
    "the problem has been taken up in different contexts by rayleigh @xcite , fetter and walecka @xcite , morse and feshbach @xcite , parker and mote @xcite , nayfeh @xcite , read @xcite and recently by wu and shivakumar @xcite and molinari @xcite .",
    "et al _ @xcite have employed a similar scheme for studying the propagation of electromagnetic waves in open dielectric systems .",
    "more recently , amore @xcite has obtained a systematic approximation to the ground state energy and the wavefunction on a general domain in a nonperturbative way .",
    "the general spectrum has also been obtained employing standard perturbative tools .",
    "however , most of these papers address only the dirichlet condition . in this paper",
    "we extend the method of @xcite to encompass the case of the neumann condition .",
    "this is crucial since it gives us an analytic handle to estimate the eigenspectrum in an effective and systematic way .",
    "besides obvious academic interest this is also necessary if one wishes to consider te mode propagation of waveguides through channels of arbitrary cross - section .",
    "the validity of the method is confirmed by comparing the analytical results with those obtained numerically for supercircular and elliptical boundaries .",
    "further , we also propose a semi - empirical formula , involving only a single parameter , giving the eigenvalues of the helmholtz equation for the case of the supercircular boundary with both type of boundary conditions . to our knowledge , this is the first instance where a semi - empirical formula has been put to use to determine the eigenspectrum .",
    "this equips us with a simple yet effective way to find out the eigenspectrum for the supercircle .",
    "the validity of the formula is judged by estimating the energy levels for several low lying modes and comparing them with numerical calculations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we set up our general scheme and in section 3 we apply it to the case of a supercircle and an ellipse . in section 4",
    "we describe the supercircle and the curious approximate duality with respect to the supercircular exponent .",
    "the details of the semi - empirical formula for both the dirichlet and the neumann boundary conditions are provided in section 5 . a short conclusion and a discussion of the results are presented in section 6 .",
    "the homogeneous helmholtz equation on a 2 dimensional flat simply connected surface @xmath2 reads , @xmath3 with the dirichlet condition @xmath4 on the boundary @xmath5 or the neumann condition @xmath6 on @xmath7 , where @xmath8 denotes the derivative along the normal direction to @xmath5 .",
    "we are interested in finding out @xmath9 for the case of the neumann condition . once we are handed any periodic function @xmath10 defining the boundary of the domain @xmath2 in flat 2d where we intend to solve the equation we first construct a circle of radius @xmath11 which respects the ` equal area ' constraint @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the area of the domain @xmath2 .",
    "the next task then is to fourier expand @xmath14 about the ` equal area ' radius @xmath11 at different orders of smallness ( denoted by @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 , \\label{rex}\\ ] ] where the fourier series at order @xmath17 is given as @xmath18 this essentially implies that we are seeking a perturbative solution to the problem in the form of corrections to the solution for a circular boundary .",
    "while the choice of the smallness parameter @xmath15 is certainly dictated to a large extent by the nature of the boundary we are considering , a certain amount of discretion is also required on our part to ensure the efficiency of the perturbative scheme as discussed in detail in the conclusion of @xcite .",

    "we also restrict @xmath116 , as before , so that we always have a convex curve .",
    "the area of the supercircle is given by , @xmath117^{2 } } { [ \\gamma(\\frac{2}{t})]}. \\label{area}\\ ] ] we show that for indices @xmath86 and @xmath118 related by the following @xcite , @xmath119 the shapes of the supercircles are almost identical .",
    "clearly , a circle is self dual since for a circle @xmath120 . on the other hand , the 2 squares @xmath121 one corresponding to @xmath88 and the other corresponding to @xmath122 @xmath121 are also dual to each other .",
    "but the areas of the 2 squares are different and differ just by a scale factor . however , the duality we define in this way is not exact .",
    "in fact , the two aforesaid cases are the only ones where we have an exact duality and our naive argument of scaling the area ( the scale factor being unity for the self - dual case ) holds true .",
    "nevertheless , it is an enticing prospect to explore how far this simple scaling argument can give us an estimate in the other cases . for our purpose",
    "it is convenient to recast ( using the properties of the gamma function , @xmath123 ) the area @xmath124 of the supercircle ( with @xmath125 ) as @xmath126 for @xmath127 the area when expressed in terms of its dual exponent @xmath86 defined by the relation ( * [ dual ] * ) is , @xmath128 in fig.[fig : i ] we have shown the major axes , ac and pr , for @xmath129 and its dual parameter @xmath130 .",
    "the corresponding minor axes are qs and ac respectively .",
    "in general , the ratio , @xmath131 , of the major axis to the minor axis ( for example ac / qs ) for @xmath132 is @xmath133 .",
    "the ratio , @xmath134 , of the major axis to the minor axis for @xmath135 ( for example pr / ac ) is @xmath136 .",
    "now it is easy to see that the above two ratios are same , i.e. @xmath137 , if @xmath86 and @xmath118 satisfy the duality relation ( * [ dual ] * ) . @xmath131",
    "also measures the scale ( the ratio of two major ( or minor ) axes , i.e. pr / ac (= ac / qs ) ) through which the supercircle is inflated under the duality transformation ( * [ dual ] * ) . in case of exact duality",
    "the area should scale by @xmath138 , i.e. @xmath139 . in fig.[fig : vii ] we have plotted @xmath140 against @xmath86 to see whether such a scaling law gives a good estimate of the area for the dual figure . the maximum aberration from the scaling law is seen to take place at two points viz . @xmath141 and @xmath142 and it is obvious that @xmath143 and @xmath144 satisfy the duality relation ( * [ dual ] * ) .",
    "the deviation is zero at @xmath88 and @xmath87 thereby vindicating our previous assertion that these 2 cases exhibit exact duality . for the other cases the deviation is very small ( within @xmath145 ) and by virtue of that we can safely exploit the duality relation for extracting the eigenvalues in the domain @xmath146",
    "once the results are known for @xmath147 .",
    "in this section we propose a semi - empirical formula for determining the eigenspectrum for the case of the supercircular boundary for both type of boundary conditions . in the following",
    "we shall consider the dirichlet and the neumann boundary conditions separately .",
    "the case of the dirichlet condition is discussed in detail . the neumann condition can be similarly treated and hence only briefly dwelt upon .",
    "given a supercircle of area @xmath124 we consider a square of length @xmath148 and a circle of radius @xmath149 and each having an area @xmath124 .",
    "the length of each side of the ` equal area ' square is , @xmath150 } { \\sqrt{[\\gamma(\\frac{2}{t } ) ] } } , \\label{sqr1}\\ ] ] and the radius of the ` equal area ' circle is , @xmath151 } { \\sqrt{[\\gamma(\\frac{2}{t})]}}. \\label{cir1}\\ ] ] the solution to ( * [ he ] * ) , when the boundary is a square ( @xmath152 ) of side @xmath148 is ,    @xmath153    and hence the eigenvalue , @xmath154 [ sqr ]    where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are positive integers .",
    "it is then easy to see that @xmath4 on @xmath157 ( i.e. on @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 ) . when the boundary is a circle ( @xmath162 ) of radius @xmath149 , the solution is ,    @xmath163    with @xmath164 and @xmath165 [ cir ]    where @xmath166 is the @xmath24 zero of the @xmath25 order bessel function , @xmath167 .",
    "now to build up a semi - empirical formula for the case of a supercircle we will attempt to find an expression for the eigenvalue @xmath168 in the range @xmath169 .",
    "further , the duality discussed in the preceding section will allow us to extend our results to @xmath170 making the whole domain as @xmath171 .",
    "it is easy to figure out from fig.[fig : i ] that in the range @xmath172 the boundary has a shape which is an intermediate between a circle and a square .",
    "so it makes sense to try an expression of the form , @xmath173 i.e. we take an average of @xmath174 and @xmath175 with suitable weight factors .",
    "we note that all the eigenvalues are calculated for boundaries enclosing an equal area given by ( * [ area ] * ) .",
    "hence the @xmath148 and the @xmath149 in the equation ( * [ sqr ] * ) and ( * [ cir ] * ) are identified with the ones appearing in the equation ( * [ sqr1 ] * ) and ( * [ cir1 ] * ) respectively . to find an explicit form of @xmath176 we note that in the limiting cases @xmath88 and @xmath87 the semi - empirical formula must reduce to , @xmath177 in other words , in such limits",
    ", we must have , @xmath178 clearly , there can be infinitely many choices of @xmath176 fulfilling the above criteria ( * [ lower1 ] * ) .",
    "the simplest choice is @xmath179 .",
    "unfortunately the eigenvalues calculated with this choice does not match very well with the corresponding numerical results .",
    "so an exact form of these weight factors can not be found out from the above arguments only and is best obtained through a ` trial and error ' method .",
    "we have explored different choices of @xmath176 , calculating the eigenvalues and comparing them with the numerical results . as the next plausible candidate we take @xmath180 and try to estimate the best @xmath181 using numerical results .",
    "finally we have settled for the choice , @xmath182 , so that @xmath183 so the final expression for the eigenvalue for a supercircle with an exponent @xmath86 @xmath184 is furnished through the following expression : @xmath185{\\cal{e}}_{c } ( \\rho_{l , j})\\right]\\frac {    t \\gamma(\\frac{2}{t})}{2[\\gamma(\\frac{1}{t})]^{2 } } , \\label{first}\\ ] ] where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are the eigenvalues for a unit area square and a unit area circle respectively . for a particular excited mode",
    "@xmath188 and @xmath166 have to be chosen properly . in table",
    "[ table:1 ] we have shown the exact mapping between the parameters @xmath189 and @xmath190 of @xmath191 and @xmath166 of @xmath192 for the first 10 states . the eigenvalues ( including the degeneracies ) @xmath191 and @xmath192 are arranged in increasing order of magnitude and are then matched one to one .",
    "note that all the states with @xmath42 for the circle are doubly degenerate and hence are written twice .",
    "each pair of @xmath155 and @xmath193 corresponds to one @xmath166 .",
    "here we have excluded the trivial case @xmath194 and @xmath195 having done this we next embark upon the task of finding the eigenvalues in the regime @xmath196 . to find an explicit form of @xmath197 in this region we note that in the limiting cases @xmath198 and @xmath199 the semi - empirical formula should yield , @xmath200 i.e. we require , @xmath201 this is where the duality relation ( * [ dual ] * ) comes into play . plugging it in ( * [ f ] * ) we arrive at the following functional form of @xmath197 , @xmath202 clearly , such a choice of @xmath197 satisfies the limiting conditions .",
    "so , finally for @xmath118 lying in the range @xmath203 the duality implies that the expression for the eigenvalues will be : @xmath204\\frac{t'\\gamma(\\frac{2}{t'})}{2[\\gamma(\\frac{1}{t'})]^{2}}. \\label{second}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the above expressions we have evaluated the eigenvalues for the first 21 states ( including the degenerate ones ) for a supercircle and compared them with the numerically obtained values .",
    "the comparisons are shown in fig.[fig : viii ] , fig.[fig : ix ] and fig.[fig : x ] .",
    "we find that the agreement is excellent over a wide range of the supercircular exponent @xmath86 except for a few cases which we discuss in the next section .      in case of the neumann boundary condition",
    "we must have @xmath205 on @xmath7 .",
    "the vanishing of the normal derivative implies that for the square boundary with side @xmath148 the eigenfunction should now be , @xmath206 this , however , has no effect on the eigenvalues with the exception of @xmath207 , @xmath208 and @xmath209 , @xmath210 for which one now has non trivial @xmath1 . on the other hand , for the circular boundary of radius @xmath149",
    "the eigenfunction remains the same as before , but the neumann boundary condition dictates that we must have , @xmath211 where @xmath212 is now the @xmath24 zero of the derivative of the @xmath25 order bessel function , i.e. @xmath213 . barring these slight modifications , the basic recipe for finding out the eigenvalues remains unaltered from the dirichlet case .",
    "the eigenvalues are given by the expressions ( * [ first ] * ) and ( * [ second ] * ) with properly matched @xmath191 and @xmath214 . in table [ table:2 ] we have illustrated the exact matching between the parameters by considering some low lying modes . here",
    "also we have excluded the trivial case @xmath215 and @xmath216 as it was done for the dirichlet case .",
    "we have plotted the eigenvalues for the first 18 states ( including the degenerate ones ) and compared them with the numerical results in fig.[fig : xi ] and fig.[fig : xii ] .",
    "once again the matching is found to be reasonably good save and except a few levels whose discussion we postpone to the next section .",
    "comparison of the empirical and the numerical eigenvalues for the first seven states for a supercircle with exponent @xmath129 for both type of boundary conditions is given in table [ table:3 ] .",
    "in this paper we have generalised the formalism developed in @xcite to encompass the case of neumann type boundary condition .",
    "we have also explicitly verified the results for two boundary geometries - supercircle and ellipse .",
    "this is quite significant since the helmholtz equation is not exactly solvable for such geometries . here",
    "we briefly highlight the salient features which make our formalism different from the existing ones .",
    "the scheme we develop is completely different from those prevalent to attack such kind of boundary value problems .",
    "however , it does have a parallel in the rayleigh - schrdinger type potential perturbation in quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , one of the primary motivations of the order by order construction of the fourier series in @xcite was to make contact with the time independent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics . in 2-level systems in quantum mechanics one witnesses the phenomena of level crossing when the hamiltonian is perturbed .",
    "this is most easily achieved by placing the system in a constant electric or magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the analogy with quantum mechanics is further consolidated with the observation that boundary perturbation can also induce crossing of the levels .",
    "although in quantum mechanics one usually solves a dirichlet boundary value problem , here we show that the phenomena of level crossing can appear even in neumann type problems .",
    "another unique feature is that unlike any other perturbation scheme ours does not require a separate formalism to treat degeneracies .",
    "degenerate states are handled equally elegantly as the non - degenerate ones . as opposed to earlier schemes where the perturbation parameter is an artificial one here a real one , extracted from the parameters defining the irregular boundary , serves as a perturbation parameter .",
    "it is found that for any perturbation the higher states are more affected .",
    "we have plotted beyond the 20th excited level and have shown that the analytical perturbation procedure developed here does reasonably well even for such higher states .",
    "finally , our scheme is a one shot process . if there is an equation for the family of closed curves ( like that in an ellipse or a supercircle ) one can have the full spectrum just from a knowledge of the parameters of the equation .",
    "we exploit the parameters of curve equation as the perturbation parameter which is a measure of the deviation from a circle and obtain the results in one go .",
    "one has to just substitute the parameter values to get the new spectrum whereas in all other existing schemes one has to find each time the fourier coefficients and then substitute even if the curve is of the same family .",
    "besides the phenomenon of level crossing , another interesting case is when the levels just manage to evade a crossing and veers off after touching each other tangentially . for the 2-level quantum mechanical system mentioned here",
    "one can in fact set up a criteria to predict whether or not a pair of levels will cross .",
    "it will be interesting to explore the possibility of formulating an analogous criteria for boundary perturbation .",
    "a closely related problem is to investigate why the perturbation theory falters whenever the levels display repulsion for elliptical boundary .",
    "we have seen that for the elliptical boundary , the agreement between the analytical and numerical results is quite outstanding for small values of @xmath15 .",
    "the only blemish is the inability of the scheme to predict the level repulsions .",
    "a proper understanding of this level repulsion can be a potential topic for further study .",
    "we have also put forward a single parameter semi - empirical formula giving the eigenspectrum of the 2 dimensional homogeneous helmholtz equation with dirichlet or neumann condition on a supercircular boundary .",
    "it is found that the prescription gives results to a high degree of accuracy for a wide range of the parameter @xmath86 for both type of boundary conditions barring a few cases .",
    "in fact we have checked explicitly for @xmath217 and the agreement is rather impressive throughout the range .",
    "this is quite remarkable considering the fact that a semi - empirical formula involving just a single parameter , the supercircular exponent @xmath86 , yields such accurate results .",
    "this assumes more significance because the problem is not exactly solvable analytically .",
    "even the perturbative scheme that we have developed works only for small deformations about the circle . on the other hand ,",
    "the semi empirical formula , supplemented with the duality relation gives us an analytic handle to extract the eigenvalues even when @xmath218 .",
    "a possible generalisation would be to attempt a similar formula when @xmath219 , i.e. we have a concave curve .",
    "we would also like to point out a very peculiar feature that has plagued the semi - empirical results : the abnormal behaviour of the bessel function @xmath220 .",
    "the semi - empirical formula for the dirichlet boundary condition does not provide the anticipated results whenever there is a contribution to @xmath175 from the zeros of @xmath221 which is quite mysterious indeed .",
    "the first such case arises from @xmath222 which contributes to the eigenvalues of the second and the third modes .",
    "it is clear from table [ table:3 ] that for the dirichlet case the agreement between the empirical and the numerical values is outstanding and the maximum error is @xmath223 except for the second and the third states where the error is within @xmath224 .",
    "the next victims are the ninth and the tenth modes which receive contribution from the second zero @xmath225 of @xmath221 and in both cases the degree of mismatch is little pronounced but the relative errors are within @xmath226 . in the case of the neumann condition",
    "also there is disparity between the numerical and the semiempirical predictions for some of the eigenvalues .",
    "the first instance occurs in the case of the first and the second modes both of which involve a contribution from @xmath227 .",
    "table [ table:3 ] also shows that the errors for the aforesaid modes are around @xmath228 for @xmath129 . for the other modes the matching is very good and the errors are within @xmath229 .",
    "the next levels afflicted with this anomaly are the eleventh and the twelfth ones which involve @xmath230 .",
    "this mysterious behaviour of @xmath220 is something which can not be accounted for at this point and calls for deeper study .",
    "strangely enough , all these @xmath220 states also involve level repulsion . in this context",
    ", it may be mentioned that chakraborty _",
    "et al _ @xcite had earlier reported the failure of perturbative treatment in the cases where the levels repel each other for the case of dirichlet condition on an elliptical boundary and there also the levels were associated with @xmath221 . here too the analytical scheme for the neumann boundary on the supercircle reveals that the @xmath220 states display level repulsion . from the results at hand it seems as if level repulsion and @xmath220 abnormality go hand in hand .",
    "but we do not know whether this is sheer coincidence or there is an underlying connection between the two . in any case",
    "we think it would be worthwhile to look into this aspect .",
    "sp would like to acknowledge council of scientific and industrial research ( csir ) , india for providing the financial support .",
