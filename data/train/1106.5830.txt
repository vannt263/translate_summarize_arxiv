    "<S> dipole , triangular , and higher harmonic flow that have an origin in the initial density fluctuations has gained a lot of attention as they can provide additional important information about the dynamical properties ( e.g. viscosity ) of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations in the initial geometry should be also reflected in the detail shape and velocity field of the system at freeze - out . in this </S>",
    "<S> talk i discuss the possibility to measure such fluctuations by means of identical and non - identical particle interferometry .    </S>",
    "<S> the initial spatial conditions in heavy ion collisions are not azimuthally symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> due to particle rescatterings it leads to the anisotropic flow  </S>",
    "<S> anisotropies in particle momentum distributions  with elliptic flow being the well known example . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a significant progress has been reached in understanding the role of the initial density fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it was realized that such fluctuations lead to odd harmonic anisotropic flow , studying of which brings new insights into dynamics of the system evolution . </S>",
    "<S> below , i briefly summarize recent developments . </S>",
    "<S> i apologize for not providing the full list of references  many of which can be found in other proceedings of this conference .    an importance of the initial state fluctuations for flow development has been noticed in  @xcite , though the exact relation between fluctuation and the final event anisotropies were not clear . in  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite an observation was made that non - zero two - particle rapidity correlations ( as observed in @xmath0 collisions ) in conjunction with radial flow ( accepted part of the system evolution in @xmath1 collisions ) lead to a narrow in azimuth and long ranged in rapidity correlations . </S>",
    "<S> such correlations were observed experimentally and called _ </S>",
    "<S> ridge_. this mechanism ( non - zero `` primordial '' rapidity correlations + radial flow @xmath2 ridge ) have been exploited later in several other models that try to address in more detail a ( more subtle ) question of the origin of the `` primordial '' rapidity correlations . </S>",
    "<S> although the appearance of the ridge and anisotropic flow fluctuations look as totally unrelated phenomena , they appeared to be different views on the same thing  </S>",
    "<S> reaction of the system to the fluctuation in the initial density . in  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was shown explicitly that the fluctuations in the initial density distribution that extends over large rapidity range lead to the ridge structure in two particle correlations . </S>",
    "<S> it was also noticed that after subtraction of the expected contribution from elliptic flow , two - bump structure appears on the away - side . </S>",
    "<S> further studies  @xcite with a single  hot spot  </S>",
    "<S> embedded into otherwise smooth background appeared quite revealing . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to an expectation  @xcite that such a hot spot moved out by the radial flow would create a `` bump '' in azimuthal distribution it appeared that that the hot spot actually `` blocks '' the development of the radial flow and leads to a `` dip '' in particle distribution at the corresponding azimuth , accompanied by side - splashes from both sides . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , in terms of the correlation function the `` bump '' and the `` dip '' leads to the same structure - the ridge , as both means _ positive _ correlations . at the same time , the exact shape of the correlation function ( e.g. the strength of the third harmonic , which is important below ) is different .    </S>",
    "<S> it was noticed in  @xcite that the fluctuating initial conditions generate anisotropic flow of different harmonics . that followed by understanding  @xcite that the perturbations due to each of the hot spots can be treated independently , which allows to reformulate the problem from a different perspective  </S>",
    "<S> decompose the initial density into multipoles and study the system responce to each of the multipoles - the approach widely discussed at this conference as flow ( dipole , triangular , quadrangular , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> one can envision such an approach as rotating each of the event to a given harmonic symmetry plane , such that at the end one could have a smooth initial conditions but with a shape corresponding to a given harmonic . </S>",
    "<S> the question addressed in this talk is if with the help of femtoscopy ( identical and non - identical two - particle correlations ) one can directly observe such triangular etc . </S>",
    "<S> shapes of the system . in this study </S>",
    "<S> i follow an approach of the first papers where the azimuthally sensitive femtoscopic analyses have been proposed  @xcite , and blast wave and ampt models calculations .     for typical values of parameters used in this work . , </S>",

    "<S> , the full space - time information can not be obtained , and one can access only the distribution in @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the particle position at time @xmath5 ( after freeze - out ) , and @xmath6 is the particle velocity . for a gaussian source , the correlation function appears to be a gaussian c ( , ) 1 + _ i , j r_ij^2 q_i q_j , where @xmath7 is the pair relative momentum , @xmath8 is the particle average momentum , and @xmath9 are the hbt radii . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation from a gaussian form can be studied by evaluating the higher moments of the distribution ( for the effect of non - gaussiness on hbt radii , see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> detailes of femtoscopic analyses can be found in a review  @xcite .         </S>",
    "<S> we use a standard side - out - long system  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig : coordinates ] ) and concentrate on azimuthal dependence of the side , out , and side - out radii . for a _ stationary _ ( not expanding ) source </S>",
    "<S> the radii azimuthal dependence can be expressed as r_side^2= = ^2+^2 - 2 , which has only @xmath10 harmonic . </S>",
    "<S> higher harmonics azimuthal dependence appears only as deviation from the gaussian , e.g. in @xmath11 and @xmath12 for triangular and quadrangular shapes respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the picture changes if one considers azimuthal variation in the expansion velocity . to study this effect </S>",
    "<S> we employ a blast wave model . </S>",
    "<S> we assume longitudinally boost invariant source and freeze - out at a constant temperature @xmath13  mev . </S>",
    "<S> expansion velocity profile is parametrized in a form _ t(r,)=_t , max[1+a_boost ( n ) ] , + r_max = r[1+a_space ( n ) ] , with direction of the collective velocity being perpendicular to the line @xmath14 $ ] going through the emission point . </S>",

    "<S> ; @xmath19 can be estimated from @xmath21 dependence and is taken to be in the range 0.03 - 0.07 . </S>",
    "<S> the azimuthal dependence of the obtained hbt radii , see figure  [ fig : bwradii ] , indicates that the higher harmonics shape effects become clearly visible ( and measurable ) . </S>",
    "<S> note the difference in the amplitudes of @xmath22 terms . </S>",
    "<S> the radii modulation strongly depends on the parameters of the model , and the correspondng measurements will be very important in evaluating the velocity profiles at freeze - out and testing models .    the ampt model  @xcite has been extensively used in studying the effect of the initial state fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we use this model to study au+au collisions at = 200  gev . </S>",

    "<S> once again , the radii dependence on the azimuth is clearly seen . a detailed investigation of the side - out relative phases , dependece on the particle transverse momentum , etc . </S>",
