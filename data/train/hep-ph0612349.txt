    "macroscopic bodies become unstable when its rest energy is of the same order than the interaction energy with some field . for instance , a classical instability is produced when the gravitational and rest energies of a body of mass @xmath8 and radius @xmath9 are of the same order @xmath10 , leading to a gravitational collapse .",
    "quantum magnetic collapse for macroscopic magnetized objects is also claimed to occur for high magnetic fields when the magnetic energy density tends to be equal to the internal energy density .    of especial interest",
    "is the instability of the energy ground state resulting from the solution of the dirac equation for an electron in a coulomb field large enough .",
    "the eigenvalues @xcite are @xmath11 where @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "it is well known that for @xmath15 , @xmath16 the denominator diverges if @xmath17 .",
    "that is , there is a critical electric field @xmath18 for which electrons and positrons can be created spontaneously from the decay of vacuum : vacuum boils .",
    "thus , atoms with atomic number @xmath19 are not stable , due to the qed vacuum instability for electric fields @xmath20 .",
    "the usual electroweak vacuum in an external magnetic field @xmath3 has also an instability for fields greater than some critical value @xmath21 , due to the presence of charged vector bosons w ( @xmath22 is the w boson mass ) .",
    "this problem was studied by ambjorn and olesen who found solutions @xmath1 for classical equations of motion .    here",
    "we analyze the problem of quantum stability of degenerate @xmath23 boson gas and vacuum in a magnetic field , starting from the quantum statistical point of view and methods .",
    "the present authors interpret the mentioned instability of bosonic vacuum as indicating a phase transition to a self - magnetized state .",
    "we want to remark that for much lower fields , @xmath24 the similar instability might appear for instance , for @xmath25 , @xmath26 vector mesons or paired fermions in states of spin unity .",
    "a similar behavior has been found in the case of neutral vector bosons with an anomalous magnetic moment which suggests the applicability of this model to describe the positronium behavior in a strong magnetic field and to discuss the possibility of qed vacuum self - magnetization .",
    "for @xmath23 bosons in an external magnetic field @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) the energy spectrum is @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the landau quantum numbers and @xmath31 is the momentum component along the field direction .",
    "the ground state @xmath32 vanishes for @xmath33 , and becomes imaginary ( unstable ) for @xmath1 .",
    "we started from the expression for the thermodynamic potential at the tree level approximation @xmath34 the first term in ( [ wpot ] ) is the statistical contribution@xcite @xmath35 +   \\nonumber \\\\   + \\frac{eb}{4 \\pi^2 \\beta } \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty } b_n",

    "the second one @xmath39 corresponds to the zero point energy density of vacuum , obtained as the zero temperature and zero density limit of @xmath40 .",

    "vacuum shows a paramagnetic behavior , described by @xmath48      for @xmath49 , the average w boson population in excited landau states is negligible small , and most of the w density is in the landau ground state , which near the zero momentum along @xmath50 behaves as @xmath51.\\ ] ] if @xmath52 , we would have an infrared divergence at @xmath53 .",
    "actually , the population in the landau ground state increases as the parameter @xmath54 decreases : there is a bose condensation but no critical temperature . for such conditions if @xmath55 is the density in the ground state , the magnetization is @xmath56 and the condition of self magnetization for @xmath57 can be written as @xmath58 we see that for @xmath59 , the field can be maintained self - consistently for @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , the instability of the thermodynamic potential at @xmath62 due to the arising of effectively massless vector charged particles , can be avoided and the field intensity is kept always as @xmath63 .",
    "the condensate behaves as ferromagnetic .    from the general expression foe the energy momentum",
    "tensor@xcite we get anisotropic pressures @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively , @xmath66 @xmath67 we see that the contribution of observable particles , given by the statistical term in the expression for the total thermodynamic potential , vanishes in the zero temperature and zero chemical potential limit .",
    "the remaining term leads to the zero point energy of vacuum . for vacuum ,",
    "the average particle density vanishes , but other quantities like energy density , magnetization and pressures are non - zero .    experimental results in condensed matter have shown @xcite that a fermion gas bosonize for temperatures close to zero ( in usual cgs units , the adimensional parameter @xmath68 small enough ) , leading either to bcs pairing or to bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the last case shows ferromagnetic properties @xcite .",
    "thus , if the thermal disorder decreases enough , it leads through a phase transition to a lower energy highly ordered state . as the increasing magnetic field produces also an increasing order of the fermion system , and if @xmath49 , the mechanism of bosonization might lead to lower energy states through bose - einstein condensation .",
    "thus , the occurrence of such mechanism is interesting in connection to the origin of large magnetic fields in some white dwarfs ( e.g. @xmath69 g ) , if vector pairing electrons occur and condense@xcite .",
    "( also , if charged vector di - quarks are formed in neutron stars , a version of our model might be of interest in explaining the arising of larger fields ( @xmath70 g ) in neutron stars ) .      in electroweak vacuum",
    "the magnetization ( [ wvacmagn ] ) diverges for @xmath71 .",
    "one can pick up the logarithmical infrared divergence by considering again a neighborhood of zero momentum for the landau ground state .",
    "one gets the term @xmath72 this divergence ( fig .",
    "1 ) is indicating a phase transition to a ferromagnetic state for @xmath73 , which we may understand as due to a sort of bose - einstein condensation of electrically positive and negative virtual quanta whose effective mass is non - zero but arbitrary small .    by equating @xmath74",
    ", one can obtain an electroweak vacuum self - magnetization satisfying @xmath75 thus , the self - magnetization avoids the divergence of both @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "vacuum magnetization vs. magnetic field in a logarithmic scale .",
    "note that @xmath77 diverges for @xmath78 .",
    "a similar behavior is expected for the neutral boson case.,width=566 ]    using the previous expressions ( [ parpr ] ) , ( [ magnpr ] ) we find a positive pressure in the direction parallel to the field @xmath79 , and a negative perpendicular pressure @xmath80 this leads to magnetostrictive effects for any value of the magnetic field since @xmath81 vacuum is compressed perpendicularly to @xmath3 , due to the negative pressures , and as the pressure @xmath82 is positive , it is stretched in along @xmath3 .",
    "it is believed that neutron stars magnetic fields could be produced due to ferromagnetic spin coupling of neutrons .",
    "the boson state resulting from such pairing is more favorable energetically , since its gibbs free energy is smaller than that of the original neutron system @xcite . for neutral vector bosons with an anomalous magnetic moment we use ( from ref.@xcite ) the following spectrum @xmath83 @xmath84 , leading to states with magnetic moment @xmath85 the ground state contain again effectively massless particles , @xmath86 vanishes for @xmath87 , and becomes imaginary for @xmath88 , in analogy to the charged case , leading to the instability .",

    "this means that neutral boson vacuum also can self - consistently maintain the field , keeping @xmath99 .",
    "again , vacuum paramagnetic properties conduce to the achievements of anisotropic pressures @xmath100 and @xmath101    for a gas of density @xmath102 in the condensate @xmath103 , and according to the value of @xmath102 , self consistent fields @xmath104 may occur up to @xmath105 g",
    ". this might be another mechanism for production of extremely large fields in neutron stars @xcite . for @xmath106",

    "@xmath111 the electron - positron vacuum shows a paramagnetic behavior , but @xmath112 .",
    "but for @xmath113 , the qed vacuum polarization effects , like the creation of electron - positron pairs by a photon , become important .",
    "photons coexist with mutually independent virtual @xmath114 pairs and with bound @xmath114 virtual states ( positronium ) , which is related to the singular behavior of the polarization operator @xmath115 near the thresholds for these processes@xcite .",
    "such singularity contributes with an absorptive term : vacuum becomes unstable and decays in observable @xmath114 pairs or positronium .",
    "the first threshold for free pair creation occurs for the minimal photon energy @xmath116 . for a smaller energy , @xmath117 vacuum decay in @xmath114 bound states , i.e. , positronium , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the positronium binding energy .",
    "we want to address the problem of the positronium vacuum in a magnetic field .",
    "the positronium mass in the landau ground state of the electron and positron is @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the binding energy which is due to the coulomb interaction between the electron and the positron in presence of a high magnetic field ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "for the coulomb ground state , @xmath121 reaches high values when the distance between the larmor orbits of the electron and the positron tends to zero@xcite .",
    "we introduce as fundamental assumption that the relativistic expression for the energy of such one - dimensional positronium state bearing an anomalous magnetic moment is a particular case of ( [ neuboson ] ) @xmath123 , with @xmath124 , and a degeneracy factor @xmath125 .",
    "this is equivalent to assume the bosonization of the pair resulting from the parallel and antiparallel spin coupling of virtual electrons and positrons , leading to a neutral boson with a magnetic moment @xmath124 and confined to move parallel to the field @xmath3 .",
    "these virtual positronium states lead to a logarithmic divergence of the neutral boson vacuum magnetization for @xmath126 .",
    "the energy density is @xmath127 one can obtain easily the magnetization @xmath128 it is easily seen that @xmath129 diverges logarithmically .",
    "this divergence is indicating a phase transition to a ferromagnetic state for @xmath130 .",
    "by equating @xmath131 and calling @xmath132 , one obtain a vacuum self - magnetization satisfying @xmath133 this suggests the arising of a ferromagnetic phase transition for qed vacuum , which we may understand as due to a sort of bose - einstein condensation of positronium in its ground state whose effective mass is arbitrary small .",
    "it means that near @xmath134 all the previous considerations about neutral boson vacuum behavior for @xmath135 are applicable to the positronium vacuum ; in particular , vacuum self - magnetization might be possible in qed .",
    "for electroweak vacuum , the contribution from @xmath136 vector bosons to the ground state energy shows an instability for @xmath137 .",
    "the magnetization @xmath138 diverges in both the dense medium and the vacuum cases for @xmath139 . by equating @xmath140",
