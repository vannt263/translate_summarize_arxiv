    "molecular emission from supernovae ( sne ) remains rarely detected , as the formation of even the most stable molecules is difficult in the sn ejecta . the high uv radiation due to recombinations , and the energetic electrons from the radioactive decay of @xmath2ni and @xmath2co dissociate molecules efficiently .",
    "the presence of molecules in ejecta could thus imply an inhomogeneous distribution of material within the ejecta and could constrain the degree of mixing .",

    "we extracted a spectrum from the brightest part of 6 pixels along the slit ( 8.76@xmath14 ) in each dataset .",

    "we subtracted from the irac band 2 ( 4.5@xmath0 m ) image the contribution by synchrotron emission that we estimated from the irac 3.6@xmath0 m  map , after accounting for wavelength- and time - dependent zodiacal emission .",

    "fig .  [ akarispec ] shows the akari spectra towards four positions in cas a. the spectra clearly show the double - peaked profile characteristic for the unresolved ro - vibrational band due to the co fundamental at 4.65@xmath0 m .",
    "the co emission is detected from not only shocked ejecta but also unshocked ejecta at the center .",
    "the _ akari _ spectra show no other lines than the co fundamental band within our spectral resolution .",
    "we were able to extract a dozen spectra along the 1@xmath1 slit length , some of which are combined to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "the properties of 9 spectra are listed in table [ coproperties ] .    we have determined the physical parameters of the co gas by comparing the observations to isothermal lte emission models from the spectrafactory database@xcite .",
    "the observed profiles show clearly separated p and r branches , which suggests that the emission is optically thin ( see fig .  [ akarispecmodelfit ] ) .",
    "we therefore present an analysis in the optically thin limit since it greatly simplifies matters .",
    "we also considered optically thick models ; however , we found that all spectra are reproduced more efficiently by optically thin models than optically thick ones .    in the optically thin limit ,",
    "the emission is directly proportional to the number of emitting molecules in the beam , and the observed shape of the profile ( i.e. band width , peak separation and relative strength of the p and r branches ) depends only on the temperature . in lte",
    ", the boltzmann equation determines the relative populations over the molecular levels ; and with the frequencies and einstein a coefficients given by @xcite and the partition function from the hitran database ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , we then calculate the line intensities for each of the ro - vibrational transitions that make up the entire band . in the spectrafactory models ,",
    "each of the individual lines is represented by a gaussian line profile with a doppler width of 3 km  s@xmath21 .",
    "the entire spectrum is then convolved by a gaussian ( instrumental ) profile and rebinned to simulate the observations .",
    "while the intrinsic line profile and width might not be appropriate for the environment studied here , they have no influence on the resulting band profile .",
    "indeed , the instrumental resolution is far too low to resolve these individual lines , and since the lines are optically thin , line overlap is not important .    finally , we applied a radial velocity shift to the co model spectra and included a linear background flux in our model .",
    "our complete fitting routine then runs over models at temperatures between 500 and 3000 k ( in steps of 100 k ) and for radial velocities in the range -10,000 to + 10,000 km  s@xmath21  ( in steps of 10 km  s@xmath21 ) . for each of these combinations",
    ", we then used a non - negative least - squares routine ( nnls , * ? ? ? * ) to find the scale factors for the co model and the background that minimizes the @xmath22 for each of the 9 cas a spectra .",
    "table 1 summarizes the resulting best fit parameters for all spectra .",
    "we can reproduce the observed emission with optically thin co emission at temperatures between 1200 - 2400 k at the shell and 900 k at the center ; an example of the model fits is shown in fig .",
    "[ akarispecmodelfit ] .",
    "such temperature differences make sense : since the center is where unshocked ejecta ( e.g. si ) are detected @xcite it is not surprising that we find the cooler co there .",
    "the derived radial velocities of the co gas ( see table 1 ) however present some puzzles .",
    "the different spectra show co emission at very different velocities ranging from -300 to -5600 km  s@xmath21 .",
    "note that the uncertainty in the ng spectrum is 0.006@xmath0 m which translates to an uncertainty of typically 400 km  s@xmath21 on the velocities .",
    "we find that toward 4 positions ( marked in bold in table 1 ) , the co velocities are roughly consistent with those in ejecta , but for the other positions , there are large differences between the co velocities and those measured from the gas lines . co models where the radial velocity is fixed to any of the gas line velocities are significantly worse ; a comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ akarispecmodelfit ] .",
    "although non - lte effects clearly affect the band shape ( see fig .",
    "[ akarispecmodelfit2 ] ) , it may well be that some of the co velocities intrinsically differ from the ionized gas line velocities .    in the optically thin lte limit , we can estimate the co mass as follows .",
    "the total ( integrated ) flux in the co band is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the partition function , @xmath25 is the total number of co molecules in the beam , @xmath26 is the distance , @xmath27 is the statistical weight and @xmath28 is the energy of the upper level @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the einstein coefficient for spontaneous transition from @xmath29 to @xmath31 and the sum runs over all transitions in the band . given the derived co temperature , @xmath25 is readily calculated , and multiplying this by the mass of a co molecule then yields the total co mass per beam .",
    "the total co mass from all 9 spectra combined is about 1.4@xmath3210@xmath33 m@xmath34 , where the derived mass for each spectrum is given in table 1 . from the co fundamental map in fig .",
    "[ comap ] , we find that the total co flux is a factor of 43 higher than the total flux of all 9 spectra combined . a rough estimate of the total co mass in cas a is thus ( 5.9@xmath350.3)@xmath3210@xmath36 m@xmath34 .",
    "fig .  [ comap ] shows the fundamental band co map .",
    "surprisingly , the distribution of freshly formed co molecules is similar to that of the ejecta , especially when comparing to the ne map .",
    "this indicates that co molecules are formed in ejecta as a precursor of dust formation .",
    "the fact that the morphology of the co map is almost identical to that of the ejecta map proves that co has formed in an earlier phase of the supernova event , and is now heated by the more recent reverse shock .",
    "we also compare the co map to the 21 @xmath0 m dust map @xcite .",
    "the 21 @xmath0 m dust feature can be reproduced mainly with silica ( sio@xmath37 ) grains with a temperature of @xmath2085 k @xcite and overall morphology of the two maps is similar .",
    "the co emission coincides with the crescents ( see  green excess \" emission in fig .",
    "[ comap ] ) where the ratio of [ ne ii ] to [ ar ii ] is high @xcite .",
    "the 21 @xmath0 m dust emission is strongly correlated with ar @xcite , whereas the co molecules are strongly correlated to ne ejecta .",
    "the presence of co in cas a implies that less carbon is available to form carbon dust from the ejecta , because a large portion of carbon may have been locked in co. if type ii supernovae such as cas a are a primary source of dust in high red - shift galaxies , such dust may be relatively deficient in carbonaceous grains .    when comparing the akari spectra with those of sn 1987a ( see fig .",
    "[ akarispec ] ) , there are several notable differences : cas a lacks the pf@xmath38 and br@xmath39 hydrogen lines and the underlying continuum seen in sn1987a , and there are clear differences in the appearance of the co features . in cas",
    "a , the profiles show the double - peak structure that is characteristic for optically thin co emission ; in sn1987a , on the other hand , there is no obvious separation between the peaks , indicating that the co emission is optically thick ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "[ akarispec ] ) .    for sn1987a , @xcite used an lte model to study the co emission in the first overtone ( 2.22.5@xmath0 m ) , and estimated a co mass of @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite later reanalyzed these data with a non - lte model which reproduces the observed co overtone bands much better .",
    "consequently , they derived a co mass of 2.2 - 2.5@xmath41 , 40 - 100 times larger than the lte estimate . also for cas a , many spectra",
    "show non - lte signatures ( see fig .  [ akarispecmodelfit2 ] ) ; if these would similarly lead to an underestimate of the co mass by about the same factor , the co mass of cas a could be ( 2.4- 6)@xmath42 m@xmath34 .    in sn environments ,",
    "several mechanisms are known to destroy co molecules . in the presence of small - scale mixing , it is generally believed that co is destroyed efficiently by collisions with helium ions : @xmath43 ; if he@xmath44 is absent however , efficient co removal happens through impacts with energetic electrons that can ionize and dissociate co @xcite .",
    "finally , co is also destroyed by charge transfer with ne@xmath45 . in a fully mixed model on the other hand ,",
    "co is removed by photodissociation and photoionization . when no co was detected for sn1987a at 800 days after the explosion",
    ", it was thus concluded that all co had been destroyed @xcite .",
    "however , the detection of co in cas a indicates that co survives or reforms in the ejecta .    the co detection in cas a has implications for dust formation in sne and the cycle of carbon in the ism .",
    "first , current dust formation models @xcite assume that co molecules are destroyed prior to dust formation .",
    "however , the co detection shows this is not the case .",
    "a significant amount of carbon may have been locked in co during the 330-yr lifetime of cas a. we have checked iso lws observations and found that [ c  ii ] lines ( at 158.7 @xmath0 m ) toward cas a do not match the velocities of the supernova remnant . after subtracting the background , the lack of [ c  ii ] emission associated with cas a hints that a large portion of carbon ejecta is in co and not ionized carbon .",
    "it awaits confirmation with a higher sensitivity and spectral resolution such as with herschel or sofia .",
    "second , the presence of co in cas a suggests that macroscopic mixing in ejecta is very small .",
    "typical electron densities during the formation of co are 5@xmath3210@xmath46 - 10@xmath47 @xmath48 @xcite . the highly clumpy structures can be explained by such high density co gas within the warm or hot ejecta .",
    "the hst observations of cas a @xcite suggest a size between 0.2@xmath14 - 0.6@xmath14 ( physical size of 6000 - 12000 au ) . assuming that the density of co is 5@xmath3210@xmath46 - 10@xmath49 @xmath48 and using the estimated co mass in table 1 the clump size would be 2 - 14 ( 20 - 140 ) au for a filling factor of 10@xmath21 ( 10@xmath50 ) . note that a co density could not be directly estimated because the beam for the spectrum is too large compared to the size of clumps and thus the uncertainty of the filling factor dominates .",
    "we found co knots outside the bright ring and near the jet - like structures , and found that some of the clumps did not have ejecta counterparts .",
    "these dense , molecular ejecta clumps propagate into the ism and will eventually cool down to ism temperatures .",
    "our observations thus provide direct evidence that supernovae eject dense clumps into the ism .    in summary ,",
    "our observations support the idea that sne could be important sites of molecule formation resulting in species such as co , sio , sis , o@xmath37 , so , and co@xmath37 @xcite .",
    "a significant portion of the co molecules has survived at least @xmath51 years after the initial explosion .",
    "@xcite suggest that molecules form very efficiently in the ejecta of supernovae and that 1334% of the progenitor mass of ejecta material could be in molecular form .",
    "for a 25 m@xmath34 progenitor , @xcite estimated a gas ejecta mass of @xmath2015 m@xmath34 after accounting for mass loss ; however , observations of cas a infer an observed ejecta mass of @xmath204 m@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "if co locks up c and o in molecular form , and other molecular species lock up other heavy elements , then some of the missing ejecta mass could be in molecular form as well as in dust form .",
    "recently , a dust mass of 0.4 - 0.7 m@xmath52 was estimated in sn1987a @xcite , emphasizing the importance of dust in supernovae .",
    "we have shown the detection of the fundamental vibrational mode of co at 4.65@xmath0 m  from cas a with akari .",
    "we infer co temperatures of 900 - 2400 k and a total co mass of ( 5.9@xmath350.3)@xmath3210@xmath36 m@xmath34 using an lte model",
    ". co has not been efficiently destroyed , and molecular species could thus be a significant reservoir of heavy elements in the ejecta .",
    "future modeling including supernovae explosion models and co radiative transport calculations in non - lte will allow us to examine the core density profiles and the circumstellar medium profile before the explosion .",
    "the first light test camera ( flitecam ) @xcite on sofia covers 1 - 5@xmath0 m , and it will be easier to detect the first overtone and fundamental co bands when observing in the stratosphere than from the ground .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy in the mid - infrared ( exes ) and low - resolution grism ( forcast ) @xcite on sofia will thus further advance our understanding of molecule and dust evolution .",
