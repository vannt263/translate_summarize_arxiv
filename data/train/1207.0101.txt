    "a circumbinary planet in the _ kepler_-16 system was discovered in 2011 basing on the data from the _ kepler _ spacecraft @xcite .",
    "its orbital parameters were determined in @xcite .",
    "an application of an empirical numerical - experimental criterion @xcite of the stability of planetary circumbinary orbits , as well as long - term numerical integrations of the _ kepler_-16b orbit , identifies this system as stable , though not far ( in about 1020% in the semimajor axis of the planet ) from the inner instability zone @xcite .",
    "however , a fine structure of the stability border in the space of orbital parameters has not yet been studied .    although the planet _",
    "kepler_-16b is the first one that has been discovered to follow a circumbinary orbit around a system of two main - sequence stars , a great amount of theoretical and numerical - experimental work was accomplished in the past three decades on the hypothetical planetary dynamics in double stellar systems . a short but comprehensive review of basic theoretical findings on the relevant stability criteria that can be used to assess the stability of planetary motion in double stellar systems , including both inner and outer orbits , is given in @xcite .    in particular , criteria , that are most widely used now for these purposes ,",
    "were derived in a numerical - experimental way by @xcite .",
    "an important point is that the fractal structure of stability / instability borders ( in the spaces of orbital elements ) , described by these criteria , is averaged out : the borders are approximated by smooth curves . in our paper",
    "we show that the patterns of the border structure are important for understanding the current and former dynamical states of _ kepler_-16b .",
    "note that the `` ragged '' structure of the borders in the case of inner ( circumstellar ) orbits was analytically revealed by @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite explored the stability of inner ( circumstellar ) and outer ( circumbinary ) planetary orbits in the @xmath0  cen a  b system .",
    "our general approach here is analogous to that we used in @xcite .",
    "it is as follows .",
    "we integrate test planetary orbits on a fine grid of the starting values of the orbital pericentric distance and eccentricity , fixing other orbital elements for a particular epoch . to assess the stability of the planetary motion , we use two stability criteria .",
    "the first criterion is the value of the maximum lyapunov exponent .",
    "the second criterion is the `` escape - collision '' one : the orbit is stable if the planet does not escape ( passing to hyperbolic orbit ) from the system , or does not encounter with any of the central stars .",
    "resonances in hamiltonian systems often appear in multiplets ; overlapping of resonances in the multiplets leads to chaos @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show how the _ kepler_-16 dynamics serves as a particular illustration to this general rule . in section  [ sec_sd ] , we construct the stability diagrams in the `` pericentric distance   eccentricity '' plane . the location of the planet _ kepler_-16b , which turns out to be situated just at the edge of chaos domain , in a particular resonance cell , is analyzed in section  [ sec_ecd ] . how these findings relate to modern scenarios of planet formation",
    "is discussed in section  [ sec_rpfs ] . in section  [ sec_rd ] ,",
    "we present a straightforward dynamical explanation for the fact that the resonance cells neighboring to that occupied by _ kepler_-16b do not harbor any planet .",
    "section  [ sec_asrc ] is devoted to a brief stability analysis of the circumbinary systems _ kepler_-34 and _ kepler_-35 ; planets in these systems also turn out to be safe in resonance cells .",
    "our basic conclusions are formulated in section  [ sec_concl ] .",
    "we adopt the values of the orbital parameters of the double star _ kepler_-16 a  b as given in @xcite , and compute the outer planetary orbits in the planar elliptic restricted three - body problem . at the initial moment of time",
    ", the relative location of the three bodies is that determined in @xcite for a particular reference epoch .",
    "we vary the planet orbital eccentricity @xmath1 and pericentric distance @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the semimajor axis of the orbit ) and integrate test planetary orbits on a fine grid of the starting values of @xmath4 and @xmath1 .    to explore the stability of the planetary motion , we use two stability criteria .",
    "the first criterion is the value of the maximum lyapunov exponent .",
    "the second criterion is the `` escape - collision '' one : the orbit is stable if the distance between the planet and one of the stars does not become less than @xmath5  au or does not exceed @xmath6  au .",
    "the lyapunov exponents of a trajectory measure the rate of exponential divergence of nearby trajectories in the phase space of motion @xcite .",
    "let @xmath7 be the initial displacement of a `` shadow '' trajectory from the `` guiding '' one , and @xmath8 be the displacement at time @xmath9 .",
    "then the lyapunov exponent is defined by the formula    @xmath10    depending on the direction of the initial displacement in the phase space , the quantity @xmath11 of a trajectory of a hamiltonian system can attain @xmath12 generally different values , where @xmath13 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "these values form symmetric pairs : for each @xmath14 there exists @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ,  , @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "therefore , in practice it is sufficient to compute solely @xmath13 exponents @xmath17 .",
    "the set of all @xmath12 exponents is called the spectrum of lyapunov exponents , or , the lyapunov spectrum .",
    "a non - zero value of the maximum ( in the spectrum ) lyapunov exponent indicates chaotic character of the motion , whereas zero value indicates that the motion is regular , i.e. , quasiperiodic or periodic @xcite . on an everywhere dense set of starting data for shadow trajectories",
    ", the lyapunov exponent attains a single ( the maximum ) value ,  the maximum lyapunov exponent , which we denote as @xmath11 in what follows .",
    "the inverse of this quantity , @xmath18 , is the so - called lyapunov time .",
    "it represents the characteristic time of predictable dynamics .    for computing the lyapunov spectra we use the algorithms and software developed in @xcite on the basis of the hqrb method by @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the qr decomposition of the tangent map matrix using the householder transformation .",
    "the trajectories are integrated using the integrator by @xcite .",
    "it is an explicit 8th order runge ",
    "kutta method due to dormand and prince , with the step size control .    for separating the regular and chaotic orbits of a dynamical system ,",
    "a statistical method was proposed in @xcite .",
    "it consists of four steps .",
    "( _ i _ ) on a representative set of initial data , two differential distributions ( histograms ) of the orbits in the computed value of @xmath19 are constructed , using two different time intervals for the integration .",
    "if the phase space of motion is divided @xcite , each of these distributions has at least two peaks .",
    "the peak that shifts ( moves in the positive direction of the horizontal axis ) , when the integration time interval is increased , corresponds to the regular orbits .",
    "the fixed peak ( or peaks ) corresponds ( correspond ) to the chaotic orbits .",
    "( _ iii _ ) the value of @xmath20 at the histogram minimum between the peaks is identified , giving a numerical criterion for separating the regular and chaotic orbits .",
    "( _ iv _ ) the obtained criterion can be used in any further computations to separate the regular and chaotic orbits on much finer initial data grids and , rather often , on smaller time intervals of integration .",
    "we consider two representative sets of initial data .",
    "they are formed as fine grids in rectangular areas in the ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath1 ) plane , namely , in the areas ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) and ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the second area , which is smaller , is explored with a higher resolution in @xmath4 and @xmath1 , i.e. , the ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath1 ) grid is finer .    in fig .",
    "[ distr ] , the distributions ( histograms ) @xmath25 of planetary orbits in the computed value of @xmath20 for the first ( large ) area are shown for two choices of the computation time : that computed on the time interval of @xmath6  yr is shown in red , and that computed on the time interval of @xmath26  yr is shown in blue .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 is defined as the number of orbits with @xmath20 in the interval @xmath27 , @xmath28 , normalized by the total number of orbits in the set ; @xmath29 is set equal to @xmath30 . as follows from the histograms in fig .",
    "[ distr ] , the threshold ( separating chaos and order ) value of @xmath19 can be set equal to @xmath31 .",
    "the resulting stability diagrams are shown in figs .",
    "[ st_diag ] and [ st_diag_hr ] .",
    "[ st_diag]@xmath3 is constructed using the lyapunov exponent criterion , and fig .",
    "[ st_diag]@xmath32 using the lyapunov exponent plus escape - collision criteria . in fig .",
    "[ st_diag_hr ] , the stability diagrams are shown in a higher resolution in @xmath4 and @xmath1 .    a direct inspection of figs .  [ st_diag]@xmath32 and",
    "[ st_diag_hr]@xmath32 demonstrates that the lyapunov exponent criterion provides a more clear - cut picture of the chaos - order borders , in comparison with using the escape - collision criterion at the same time interval of integration .",
    "what is more , the escape - collision criterion fails to identify orbits with high values of the pericentric distance and eccentricity , at least at the specified intervals of computation time .",
    "the chaos - order borders , revealed by the lyapunov exponent criterion , apparently possess fractal structure conditioned by the orbital resonances ( discussed below ) .",
    "the location of the planet _ kepler_-16b is shown in figs .  [ st_diag ] and [ st_diag_hr ] by a dot .",
    "as it is clear from the diagrams , the planet turns out to be located almost at the edge of the chaos domain , in a hazardous vicinity to it   just between the instability `` teeth '' .",
    "a direct linear extrapolation of these `` teeth '' to the @xmath33 axis shows that they correspond to integer resonances between the orbital periods of the planet and the central binary .",
    "the two teeth surrounding _",
    "kepler_-16b correspond to the 5/1 and 6/1 resonances : at these resonances , the orbital periods of the planet and the central binary are in the ratios 5/1 and 6/1 .",
    "the smaller teeth centered between the `` integer '' teeth correspond to half - integer resonances .",
    "the tooth almost pointing at _",
    "kepler_-16b corresponds to the 11/2 resonance .    why there is no instability in this resonance , at the location of _",
    "kepler_-16b , whereas the neighboring `` integer '' teeth extend down to the @xmath33 axis ?",
    "chaotic behaviour , which is often present in the dynamics of celestial bodies , is usually due to interaction of resonances ( as in any hamiltonian system , see @xcite ) . how to distinguish between resonant and non - resonant motions ?",
    "in fact , the observable commensurability between the orbital frequencies never happens to be ideally exact , at least due to observational errors . to solve this problem , a `` resonant argument '' ( synonymously , `` resonant phase '' or `` critical argument '' ) is introduced .",
    "it is a linear combination of some angular variables of a system under consideration . in our notations ,",
    "the resonant argument for an outer resonance ( a resonance between a central binary and a circumbinary particle ) is defined by the formula @xcite :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the mean longitudes of a star ( in the central binary ) and a particle , respectively ; @xmath37 is the longitude of pericenter of the particle ; @xmath38 , @xmath4 and @xmath39 are integers ; @xmath4 is the so - called _ resonance order_. ( note that in eq .",
    "( [ res_def1 ] ) the longitude of pericenter of the star is ignored , because it is practically constant . ) in outer resonance , the ratio of orbital periods of a planet and the central binary is equal to @xmath40 .",
    "usually a mean motion resonance splits in a multiplet of subresonances , corresponding to a sequence of values of @xmath39 .",
    "this phenomenon is due to precession of particle s orbit pericenter , often taking place when the motion is perturbed @xcite . here",
    "the perturbation is strong , because the mass parameter @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 are the stellar masses ) is large : it is equal to @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "hence the precession of the planetary orbit is strong .",
    "the theory of resonances splitting in multiplets was developed in @xcite for the high - order inner mean motion resonances in the dynamics of asteroids .",
    "according to this theory , inner mean motion resonance @xmath44 splits in a cluster of @xmath45 subresonances with @xmath46 .",
    "analogously , the outer mean motion resonances also split .",
    "the coefficients of the subresonant terms in the expansion of the perturbing function are proportional to the eccentricities of the particle and perturber in some powers depending on @xmath4 ; in particular , the coefficients of the first and last subresonant terms in the multiplet are proportional , respectively , to the eccentricities of the perturber and particle in the power equal to @xmath4 @xcite . in the pendulum model of subresonance ,",
    "its width ( characterizing the `` subresonance strength '' ) in the phase space is proportional to the square root of this coefficient @xcite .",
    "thus the value of @xmath4 governs this basic property of the resonant motion .",
    "consider two neighboring outer integer resonances @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which have orders @xmath4 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "the half - integer resonance between them is @xmath49 , and its order is @xmath50 .",
    "thus , for a high - order half - integer resonance , the power - law indices in the subresonant term coefficients are much greater than the indices for the neighboring integer resonances ; consequently , the strengths of subresonances are much less and their interaction is much weaker . on increasing @xmath1 , they start to overlap much later than in the neighboring integer cases .",
    "this explains why the 11/2 resonance at the eccentricity of _ kepler_-16b is stable , whereas the neighboring integer resonances 5/1 and 6/1 are unstable .",
    "concluding , _",
    "kepler_-16b survives because it is close to the half - integer 11/2 orbital resonance with the central binary .",
    "the planet is safe inside a resonance cell bounded by the unstable 5/1 and 6/1 resonances .    in the solar system , this phenomenon is analogous to the survival of pluto and plutinos .",
    "they are in the 3/2 outer orbital resonance with neptune ; thus the order of the occupied high - integer resonance is much smaller than in the _ kepler_-16 system .",
    "this is because the mass parameter @xmath51 in the case of neptune and the sun is much smaller and therefore the chaos border radically shifts to smaller values of the semimajor axis ( in units of the `` central binary '' size ) .",
    "the analogy with the case of resonant trans - neptunian objects is striking . according to @xcite ,",
    "the population of tnos in the next half - integer resonance ( 5/2 ) with neptune is estimated to be as large as in the 3/2 resonance , whereas other ( non - half - integer ) resonant populations are radically smaller .",
    "the most distant known resonant tno is in the 27/4 resonance with neptune @xcite ; note that this is farther than the 11/2 resonance .",
    "if an object in the 11/2 resonance with neptune were once discovered , it could be called a `` _ kepler_-16b of the solar system '' .",
    "although from the viewpoint of the discussed above `` trans - neptunian analogy '' the current planetary architecture of _",
    "kepler_-16 does not seem peculiar , it looks so in the light of modern theories of planet formation in circumbinary systems .",
    "indeed , it might seem from the diagram in fig .",
    "[ st_diag_hr ] that no radial migration was possible for _ kepler_-16b since its formation epoch , because otherwise it would cross the instability `` teeth '' and thus would be removed . on the other hand , in situ formation of _",
    "kepler_-16b is a theoretical challenge @xcite .",
    "let us consider this contradiction in more detail .",
    "first of all , the presence of zones of instability on the migration path does not necessarily mean catastrophic consequences .",
    "from another field of celestial mechanics , one may recall that the satellites of planets in the solar system are known to be slowly despun , in the process of tidal evolution , until they reach the well known 1:1 synchronous spin - orbit resonance , and in the course of despinning a number of chaotic layers in the phase space of motion is crossed @xcite ; the broadest layer is at the separatrix of the synchronous resonance .",
    "nevertheless , all tidally - evolved satellites ( with a possible exception of no more than three satellites , see @xcite ) are lucky to reside in the `` final '' stable synchronous resonance , as the moon does .",
    "evidently , most of the satellites were able to cross the chaotic layers without being caught in chaos forever .",
    "the reason is that the timescales for development of gross instability are usually too long in comparison with the timescales for crossing the chaotic zones @xcite . in the considered case of planetary migration",
    "the timescale for development of gross instability might be as well too long in comparison with the timescale for crossing the chaotic zone .",
    "more long - term numerical experiments are needed to verify this possibility .",
    "concerning possible scenarios for formation of circumbinary planets , modern theories and simulations favor , within the planet accretion framework , the following one : the planetary core forms further out ( in an accretion - friendly region ) in the protoplanetary disk and then migrates inward until the migration is stalled at the border of the disk inner cavity formed by the central binary @xcite .",
    "the cavity might be comparable in size to the chaos region ( explored above ) for test particles . @xcite estimate the final locations of _ kepler_-16b , 34b and 35b to be close to the truncation radii of the gas disks .",
    "though in situ formation of _",
    "kepler_-16b is still not ruled out @xcite , it is less likely owing to hostile conditions ( in particular , high encounter velocities of planetesimals and low planetesimal density ) for planetesimal accretion @xcite .",
    "one may speculate that a possible scenario could be that the inward migration of _",
    "kepler_-16b is stopped at its currently observed location due to capture in the 11/2 resonance .",
    "the current location of _ kepler_-16b close to the center of a resonance cell should be taken into account and explained when constructing formation scenarios for the planet . in a general framework of circumbinary planet formation theories , an important role of orbital resonances",
    "was mentioned and considered in @xcite . in particular , @xcite pointed out that the pumped eccentricities of planetesimals , in function of the semimajor axis , show `` interesting behavior such as somewhat resonant features '' ( see fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "such resonances as 5/1 affect the formation and orbital evolution of giant saturn - mass planets embedded in a circumbinary disc , as the results of hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite show .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that at least two astrophysical processes are known that can lead to material occupation of high - order outer resonances in relevant gravitational systems .",
    "as it is well known , in a dynamical ( e.g. , any gravitational or planetary ) system whose parameters are slowly ( adiabatically ) varying , capture in resonances can occur ; in particular , the above mentioned plutinos are believed to have been trapped in the 3/2 resonance with neptune in the kuiper belt due to the outward migration of neptune ; generally , the outward migration of the perturbing body ( planet ) in a planetary system can lead to capture of particles in outer mean motion resonances ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "another well - known astrophysical process , that leads to material occupation of outer resonances , takes place in dusty debris disks around stars with planets : when , due to dissipational forces , dust spirals inward , it can be efficiently captured in resonances ; see @xcite and references therein . @xcite",
    "accomplished simulations of the debris disk evolution in the fomalhaut system using a planet with mass equal to doubled mass of jupiter ; striking examples of dense occupation of high - order outer resonances were demonstrated : see , e.g. , fig .  14 in @xcite , where integer ( such as 4/1 and 5/1 ) and half - integer ( such as 5/2 , 7/2 , and 9/2 ) resonances dominate or are prominent in the `` semimajor axis   resonance occupation '' diagram .",
    "then , another question arises : why is there only one resonance cell that is `` occupied '' ?",
    "why there is not a lot ( or several ) planets in resonance cells like bees in a honeycomb ?",
    "at least for the cells neighboring to _",
    "kepler_-16b the answer is straightforward . again",
    ", it concerns resonances ( and their interaction ) , though different from those considered above .",
    "these are the first - order orbital resonances @xmath52 of test particles with the planet . on increasing @xmath38 , these resonances start to overlap at some critical @xmath38 , because their widths do not decrease fast enough . on such grounds @xcite inferred that in the case of small eccentricity ( @xmath53 ) of the particle orbit the critical @xmath38 is given by    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the mass parameter , and @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the masses of the star and the planet , respectively . using the third kepler law",
    ", one finds that @xmath58 corresponds to the chaotic zone width    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the semimajor axis of the planet @xcite .",
    "the particles with @xmath3 within the interval @xmath61 move chaotically . due to encounters with the planet they escape from this region sooner or later ; in such a way a particle - free zone around the planet orbit is formed .    using eq .",
    "( [ em_27 ] ) and data on @xmath60 and masses from @xcite , and setting @xmath62 , one finds for _ kepler_-16b : @xmath63 and @xmath64  au .",
    "therefore , at least the two neighboring resonance cells , namely those centered at the 9/2 and 13/2 resonances , are purged by the planet residing in the 11/2 resonance cell , because they are within the @xmath65  au distance ( see figs .  [ st_diag ] and [ st_diag_hr ] ) . thus _",
    "kepler_-16b can be called not only a `` resonant survivor '' but a `` resonant destroyer '' as well .",
    "two new circumbinary planetary systems were discovered recently , _ kepler_-34 and _ kepler_-35",
    "@xcite . let us see how the stability diagrams look like for the planets in these systems .",
    "both systems are single - planet .",
    "we take the necessary data on the masses and orbital elements from @xcite and perform computations analogous to those described above in section  [ sec_sd ] for the _ kepler_-16 case .    in comparison with _",
    "kepler_-16 , the histograms of the orbits with respect to the computed lyapunov time value can be computed on smaller time intervals , because the binaries periods in the _ kepler_-34 and _ kepler_-35 systems are much smaller . for speed of computation ,",
    "we have chosen the time intervals equal to @xmath66 and @xmath6  yr , instead of @xmath6 and @xmath26  yr in the case of _ kepler_-16 .",
    "analysis of the constructed histograms leads to the threshold ( separating chaos and order ) value of @xmath19 equal to @xmath67 for both _ kepler_-34 and _ kepler_-35 .",
    "apparently , here the threshold @xmath68 is 10 times less than in the case of _",
    "kepler_-16 , because the time intervals of computation are 10 times less .    in figs .",
    "[ st_diag34 ] and [ st_diag35 ] , the stability diagrams computed for _ kepler_-34b and _ kepler_-35b are shown .",
    "one can see that qualitatively these diagrams are analogous to those computed for _",
    "kepler_-16b ( i.e. , to figs .  [ st_diag]b and [ st_diag_hr]b ) : the planets are inside resonance cells ; these cells are bounded by the `` teeth '' of unstable resonances . though the planets are in a dangerous vicinity to the chaos domain , they are both safe inside the resonance cells . as follows from data in @xcite , the ratios of orbital periods of the planet and the stellar binary in each of the systems are equal to 10.4 and 6.34 , respectively . judging from these values ,",
    "the cells might be centered , respectively , at the half - integer 21/2 and 13/2 resonances with the central binaries ; though in the first case , due to the very high order of the resonance , the situation is not certain .",
    "while this paper was in the reviewing process , two more circumbinary planetary systems have been discovered : _",
    "kepler_-38 @xcite and _",
    "kepler_-47 @xcite . moreover",
    ", the latter one is a multi - planet system , hosting at least two planets , planet @xmath69 moving in a much larger orbit than planet @xmath32",
