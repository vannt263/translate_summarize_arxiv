    "the equilibrium problem ( ep ) for @xmath3 on @xmath0 is to find @xmath4 such that @xmath5 the solution set of ep ( [ ep ] ) is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "mathematically , ep is a generalization of many mathematical models including variational inequality problems ( vip ) , optimization problems and fixed point problems ( fpp ) , nonlinear and linear complemetarity problems , vector minimization problems and nash equilibria problems , see for instance @xcite .",
    "due to this reason , ep has been recieved a lot of attention by many authors .",
    "some notable methods for studying and solving eps are the proximal point method @xcite , the splitting proximal method @xcite , the extragradient method and the armijo linesearch method @xcite , the gradient - like projection method @xcite , the hybrid extragradient method @xcite , the extragradient - viscosity method @xcite .",
    "let @xmath7 be a mapping .",
    "let us denote @xmath8 by the fixed point set of @xmath9 , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "the problem of finding a common element of the fixed point set of a mapping and the solution set of an equilibrium problem is a task arising in various fields of applicable mathematics , sciences , engineering and economy , for example @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors presented a model which comes from nash - cournot model @xcite for finding a point in the solution set @xmath11 .",
    "as a further extension , in this paper we consider the following common solution problem .",
    "[ vipoverepandfpp ] find an element @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are bifunctions and @xmath14 are mappings .",
    "in recent years , the problem of finding a common solution of eps and/or vips and fpps has been widely and intensively studied by many authors , for example @xcite .",
    "problem [ vipoverepandfpp ] includes many previously considered problems .",
    "when @xmath15 for all @xmath16 , problem [ vipoverepandfpp ] becomes the problem of finding a common solution to eps which was introduced and studied by combettes and hirstoaga in @xcite . using the resolvent of a bifunction ,",
    "the authors proposed a general block - iterative algorithm for finding a common solution of eps .",
    "a special case of this problem is the common solutions to variational inequalities problem ( csvip ) mentioned and analyzed intensively in @xcite where the authors proposed an algorithm for csvip which combines the extragradient method @xcite with the hybrid ( outer approximation ) method . in a very recent work @xcite ,",
    "problem [ vipoverepandfpp ] has been studied and analyzed in the case @xmath17 , the authors in @xcite proposed some parallel hybrid extragradient methods which combine the extended extragradient method @xcite , the mann or halpern iterations , the parallel splitting - up technique @xcite and the outer approximation method ( hybrid method ) .",
    "a notable problem in these algorithms is that at each iteration we must construct two closed convex subsets @xmath18 of the feasible set @xmath0 and compute the next approximation being the projection of the starting point @xmath19 on the intersection @xmath20",
    ". these can be costly and affect the efficiency of the used method .    on the other hand , for finding a particular solution of problem [ vipoverepandfpp ] when @xmath21 , maing@xmath22 and moudafi @xcite introduced the variational inequality problem",

    "@xcite have replaced the proximal point method by the extragradient method @xcite for computing @xmath36 in ( [ mm2008 ] ) and proposed the following extragradient - viscosity method for vip ( [ vip1 ] ) : choose @xmath31 and @xmath37 where @xmath33 , @xmath38 , @xmath35 are suitable parameters .",
    "the advantage of using the viscosity method is that it gives us strongly convergent algorithms which have more simple and elegant structures .    in this paper ,",
    "motivated and inspired by the results in @xcite , we propose two parallel algorithms for problem [ vipoverepandfpp ] which do not require constructing two set @xmath39 , @xmath40 and computing the projection onto their intersection per each iteration as in @xcite .",

    "let us denote @xmath43 by the solution set of vip ( [ vip2 ] ) .",
    "note that if @xmath44 with @xmath45 being a suggested point in @xmath1 then vip ( [ vip2 ] ) reduces to the problem of finding an element @xmath46 which is the best approximation of @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "firstly , using the extragradient method , we find semultaneously intermediate approximations for each equilibrium problems in the family .",
    "after that , among obtained approximations , the furthest one from the previous iterate is chosen .",
    "based on this element , we compute in parallel other intermediate iterates for fixed point problems in this family .",
    "similarly , we defined the next iterate and obtain the first algorithm .",
    "next , as an improvement of finding furthest approximations in the first algorithm , we use convex combinations of component intermediate approximations and propose the second parallel algorithm . in our numerical experiments , with the first way , we see that the obtained algorithm seems to be more effective than the second one and hybrid methods proposed in @xcite .",
    "some advantages of this performance in comparing with that of cyclic methods , specially when the numbers of subproblems @xmath48 are large , can be found in @xcite and several references therein .",
