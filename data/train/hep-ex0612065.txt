    "<S> the star experiment uses polarized p+p collisions at rhic to determine the contributions to the spin of the proton from gluon spin and from orbital angular momentum of the quarks and gluons . </S>",
    "<S> selective star measurements of the longitudinal double spin asymmetry for inclusive jet and inclusive hadron production are presented here . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we report measurements of the transverse spin asymmetry for di - jet production at mid - rapidity and the transverse single - spin asymmetry for forward @xmath0 production .    </S>",
    "<S> the quark and anti - quark contributions to the spin of the proton measured with polarized deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) fixed target experiments amount to only @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the rest of the spin of the proton must come from the gluons and the orbital angular momentum of both quarks and gluons . </S>",
    "<S> however , the gluon polarization , @xmath2 , is poorly constrained from scaling violations in the dis data @xcite , and more precise and direct measurements are needed . </S>",
    "<S> polarized p+p collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) provide a very suitable environment , rich with strongly interacting probes , to measure @xmath2 directly and precisely . </S>",
    "<S> there are many processes where the gluon participates directly . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the high c.m . energy , @xmath3 = 200 gev , and high @xmath4 make next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) analysis more reliable . </S>",
    "<S> the spin program of the solenoid tracker at rhic ( star ) experiment @xcite aims , in the short term , to utilize these advantages to measure @xmath2 using inclusive jet and inclusive hadron production measurements in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the star experiment uses transversely polarized p+p collisions to gain insights into the orbital angular momentum of the partons .    </S>",
    "<S> the star collaboration previously observed a sizable analyzing power , @xmath5 , for forward @xmath0 production at large @xmath6 @xcite , similar to previous observations at lower energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the previous star results were in qualitative agreement with several different model predictions @xcite and could not differentiate between them , so higher precision measurements of @xmath5 as a function of both @xmath6 and @xmath4 were needed . </S>",
    "<S> new @xmath5 measurements with higher luminosity and polarization were performed in 2006 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : anvxfnpt ] shows preliminary results for @xmath5 as a function of @xmath6 ( left panel ) and as a function of @xmath4 for different @xmath6 bins ( right panel ) , along with model predictions .            </S>",
    "<S> the results in the left panel are consistent with the previous results @xcite in having large @xmath5 for high @xmath6 , and provide sufficient accuracy to discriminate between different dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the right panel shows that the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath5 is not well described by sivers based calculations @xcite , which predict that @xmath5 should decrease as you go higher in @xmath4 for all @xmath6 bins .    </S>",
    "<S> the star experiment also probed the sivers effect by measuring the di - jet opening angle in transversely polarized p+p collisions @xcite since boer and vogelsang @xcite suggested that @xmath5 for the distribution in relative azimuthal angle , @xmath7 , between the di - jet pairs could provide    r95 mm     access to the sivers effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : dijetsivers ] shows preliminary results from 2006 data for @xmath5 , for both beams , as a function of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the psuedorapidities for the two jets . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement was done over @xmath11 $ ] and for @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is extracted from the cross ratio of the spin - sorted @xmath7 distribution in which `` left '' and `` right '' yields were deduced from @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 , shown in figure  [ fig : dijetsivers ] , are consistent with zero - much smaller than the sivers asymetry that was observed in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) by hermes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> +    the star collaboration uses the measurement of the longitudinal double spin asymmetry , @xmath16 , for inclusive jet and inclusive hadron production to constrain @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is directly sensitive to the polarized gluon distribution function in the proton through gluon - gluon and gluon - quark sub - processes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we reported the unpolarized inclusive jet cross section from data taken in 2003 and 2004 @xcite , and preliminary results for the unpolarized inclusive @xmath17 cross section @xcite , and both show satisfactory agreement with nlo pqcd calculations over many orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement suggests the applicability of pqcd to describe the polarization observables in this kinematic region .    left panel : @xmath16 for inclusive @xmath0 production with statistical errors and the systematic band . </S>",
    "<S> right panel : mean momentum fraction of the @xmath0 in their associated jet as a function of @xmath4 and the corresponding mean jet @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> the data points are not corrected for jet acceptance or reconstruction efficiency . ]    in figure  [ fig : allpi0nz ] , the left panel , we present preliminary results of the first star @xmath16 measurement of inclusive @xmath0 production at mid - rapidity with statistical errors and the systematics band @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the systematics band does not include the normalization uncertainty due to the polarization measurement . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the grsv standard curve , which is based on the best fit to dis data , different @xmath2 scenarios from maximally positive to maximally negative and passing zero @xmath2 are also shown in this and the following figures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this measurement is consistent with previously reported @xmath16 for inclusive jets @xcite in disfavoring the maximum positive @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the right panel shows the mean momentum fraction carried by the @xmath0 in its associated jet . </S>",
    "<S> this plot shows that the @xmath0 carries a very large fraction , 70% , of its associated jet momentum . </S>",
    "<S> corrections for jet acceptance and reconstruction efficiency may reduce this fraction by @xmath18 .            </S>",
    "<S> preliminary results from 2005 of very promising @xmath16 measurements of inclusive @xmath19 and @xmath20 are shown in figure  [ fig : allplusmin ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars are statistical errors , and the associated bands indicate the systematics , which do nt include the scale uncertainty due to the polarization measurement . </S>",
    "<S> several @xmath2 scenarios for these processes are also shown . </S>",
    "<S> the ordering of the measurements of @xmath16 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 is sensitive to the sign of @xmath2 . for now , this measurement is limited by statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we are currently working on 2006 data where we have higher luminosity and polarization .        </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : alljets ] shows @xmath16 for inclusive jet production versus jet @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid points are preliminary results from 2005 data and the open circles are from 2003 + 2004 data analysis @xcite , both with statistical error bars . </S>",
    "<S> the dark and hatched bands show the systematic uncertainties for 2005 and combined 2003 and 2004 data , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these bands do not include scale uncertainties due to the beam polarization . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : alljets ] also shows several grsv nlo pqcd scenarios for inclusive jets . </S>",
    "<S> the data are consistent with zero or small gluon polarization and exclude the maximally positive gluon polarization scenario . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , these 2005 results go further in excluding much of the region in between maximally positive gluon polarization and dis based fit scenarios , and thus put a tighter constraint on @xmath2 .    in addition </S>",
    "<S> , the star collaboration studied longitudinal spin transfer of @xmath21 in polarized p+p collisions@xcite and inclusive @xmath0 production using the star endcap calorimeter as proof of principle measurements in 2005 .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary , we reported on preliminary di - jet sivers @xmath5 measurement from 2006 , and all measured @xmath5 are statistically consistent with zero , several factors smaller than expected from sidis . in addition , we reported on 2006 @xmath5 measurements of forward @xmath0 with higher statistics and polarization , which show inconsistency with twist-3 / sivers calculations ; @xmath5 does not decrease with @xmath4 in all @xmath6 bins .    in the longitudinal spin program , we reported on several preliminary @xmath16 measurements of inclusive hadrons and jets at mid - rapidity from 2005 data . </S>",
    "<S> the results are consistent in the region of kinematic overlap and provide improved constraints on the gluon spin contribution to the proton spin . </S>",
    "<S> they exclude large and positive gluon spin contributions . </S>"
