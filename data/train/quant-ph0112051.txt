    "according to the quantum theory of measurement , it is impossible to unambiguously discriminate between non - orthogonal quantum states with unit success probability . if , however , we settle for less and do nt require that we succeed every time , then unambiguous discrimination becomes possible .",
    "this procedure uses a non - unitary operation that maps the non - orthogonal states onto orthogonal ones , and these can then be discriminated without error using a standard von neuman measurement .",
    "although such an operation will always have a certain probability of failure , we can always tell whether or not the desired transformation has succeeded .",
    "this allows us to achieve unambiguous discrimination .",
    "when the attempt fails , we obtain an inconclusive answer . the optimal strategy for accomplishing",
    "this is the one that minimizes the average probability of failure .    the problem of unambiguously distinguishing between two non - orthogonal states was first considered by ivanovic @xcite , and then subsequently by dieks @xcite and peres @xcite .",
    "these authors found the optimal solution when the two states are being selected from an ensemble in which they are equally likely .",
    "the optimal solution for the situation in which the states have different weights was found by jaeger and shimony @xcite .",
    "we proposed an optical implementation of the optimal procedure along with a more compact rederivation of the general results and also showed that the method is useful in other areas of quantum information processing @xcite such as , for example , entanglement enhancement @xcite .",
    "state discrimination measurements have been performed in laboratory , first by huttner , et .",
    "@xcite and , more recently , by clarke , _ et al .",
    "both used the polarization states of photons to represent qubits .",
    "the case of three states was examined by peres and terno @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently extended to the general problem of discriminating among @xmath3 states .",
    "chefles @xcite found that @xmath3 non - orthogonal states can be probabilistically discriminated without error if and only if they are linearly independent .",
    "chefles and barnett @xcite solved the case in which the probability of the procedure succeeding is the same for each of the states .",
    "duan and guo @xcite considered general unitary transformations and measurements on a hilbert space containing the states to be distinguished and an ancilla , which would allow one to discriminate among @xmath3 states , and derived matrix inequalities which must be satisfied for the desired transformations to exist . in our previous paper @xcite , we presented the necessary conditions for optimal unambiguous discrimination and used them to derive a method for implementing the optimal solution .",
    "for the case of three states , we presented optical networks that accomplish this .",
    "one can also consider what happens if the discrimination is not completely unambiguous , i.  e.  if it is possible for errors to occur , and this was done by chefles and barnett @xcite . for an overview of the state - of - the - art on state discrimination see the excellent recent review article by chefles @xcite .    in these",
    "works discrimination among all of the states was considered . in the present paper",
    ", we consider a variant of that problem . instead of discriminating among all states , we ask what happens if we just want to discriminate between subsets of them . a motivation to consider this variant comes from its application to comparing strings of qubits in order to find out if they are identical or not which is certainly one of the basic tasks in quantum information processing .",
    "in particular , if there are three non - orthogonal states , @xmath4 , we wish to find the optimal strategy to unambiguously distinguish @xmath1 from the set @xmath5 .",
    "we refer to this problem as unambiguous quantum state filtering . in this context",
    "we should note that recently an analytical solution has been found to the following closely related problem . instead of unambiguously distinguishing between two complementary subsets of an arbitary number @xmath3 of non - orthogonal quantum states , occupying a two - dimensional hilbert space ,",
    "errors are allowed but the probability of erroneously assigning the state to one of the substes is minimized @xcite .",
    "the term `` quantum state filtering '' has been introduced there for the case when one of the subsets contains one state and the other contains all of the remaining @xmath6 states . here",
    ", we shall present the analytical solution for the case of the other possible discrimnation strategy , namely that of unambiguous quantum state filtering .",
    "the paper is divided into six sections . in section ii ,",
    "based on simple but rigorous arguments , we present the optimal analytical solution to the problem . in section iii , we compare these optimal failure probabilities for two different procedures : discrimination between @xmath1 and @xmath2 and discrimination among all three states .",
    "we find that the failure probability for the first procedure is smaller than that for the second . in section iv",
    ", we propose a possible experimental implementation using the method proposed in our previous paper @xcite , which uses a single - photon representation of the quantum states and an optical multiport together with photon detection at the output ports to implement the procedure . a brief discussion and conclusions are given in section v. finally , in the appendix",
    ", we present an alternative derivation , based on the method of lagrange multipliers , to obtain the results of section ii .",
    "the method closely parallels the techniques used for unambiguous discrimination between all states .",
    "suppose we are given a quantum system prepared in the state @xmath7 , which is guaranteed to be a member of the set of three non - orthogonal states latexmath:[$\\left\\ {    not know which one . we want to find a procedure which will tell us that @xmath7 was prepared in @xmath9 , or will tell us that @xmath7 was prepared in one of latexmath:[$\\left\\ {    distinguish @xmath9 from latexmath:[$\\left\\ {    procedure to be error - free , i.  e.  the procedure may fail to give us any information about the state , and if it fails , it must let us know that it has , but if it succeeds , it should never give us a wrong answer .",
    "we shall refer to such a procedure as quantum state filtering without error .",
    "we find that , in contrast to the unambiguous state discrimination problem , this will be possible even if @xmath1 is not linearly independent from the set @xmath12 .    if the states are not orthogonal then , according to the quantum theory of measurement , they can not be discriminated perfectly . in other words , if we are given @xmath13 , we will have some probability @xmath14 to determine what it is successfully and , correspondingly , some failure probability , @xmath15 , to obtain an inconclusive answer . if we denote by @xmath16 the _ a priori _ probability that the system was prepared in the state @xmath13 , the average probabilities of success and of failure to distinguish the states @xmath13 are @xmath17 respectively .",
    "our objective is to find the set of @xmath18 that maximizes the probability of success , @xmath19 .",
    "the procedure we shall use is a `` generalized measurement '' , which can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath20 denote a total hilbert space , which is the direct sum of two subspaces , @xmath21 .",
    "the space @xmath22 is a three - dimensional space that contains the vectors @xmath13 , and @xmath23 is an auxiliary space .",
    "the input state of the system is one of the vectors @xmath13 , which is now a vector in the subspace @xmath22 of the total space @xmath20 , so that @xmath24 a unitary transformation , @xmath25 , which acts in the entire space @xmath20 is now applied to the input vector , resulting in the state @xmath26 , which is given by @xmath27 where , in our case , @xmath28 can always be unambiguously distinguished from the set @xmath29 .",
    "then a measurement is performed on @xmath26 that projects @xmath26 either onto @xmath30 or @xmath31 ( by construction , they are in orthogonal subspaces ) .",

    "the probability of this outcome is @xmath36    the nature of the problem we are trying to solve imposes a number of requirements on the output vectors .",
    "the condition that @xmath33 be distinguishable from @xmath37 and @xmath38 requires that @xmath39 these lead to conditions on the failure vectors , @xmath40 . taking the scalar product between @xmath41 and the other two output states and using eq .",
    "( [ orthogonal ] ) and the fact that @xmath25 is unitary leads to the conditions @xmath42 our objective is to find the optimal @xmath32 and @xmath43 which satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ pi])  ( [ phi_1213 ] ) and also give the maximum success probability @xmath19 .",
    "let us now consider the failure vectors . if they were linearly independent , we could apply a state discrimination procedure to them @xcite .",
    "that means that if our original procedure fails , and we end up in the failure space , @xmath23 , then we still have some chance of determining what our input state was .",
    "this clearly implies that our original procedure , which led to the vectors @xmath44 , was not optimal , because that process followed by another on the failure vectors would lead to a higher probability of distinguishing @xmath45 from @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the optimal procedure should lead to failure vectors to which we can not successfully apply a state discrimination procedure , implying that they are linearly dependent .",
    "in fact , we will now prove that for optimal discrimination they must be collinear , by demonstrating that the contrary leads to contradiction . to this end , we assume that we have achieved optimal unambiguous discrimination of @xmath1 from @xmath48 and @xmath49 but the failure vectors are _ not _ collinear .",
    "then at least one of the two failure vectors , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , will have a component in the direction that is perpendicular to @xmath52 .",
    "we can set up a detector projecting onto this direction and a positive outcome of the measurement ( a click of the detector ) will tell us that our input state was not @xmath45 but one of the other two states .",
    "thus , contrary to our assumption that our procedure has been optimal , further distinction is possible .",
    "hence , the failure vectors must be collinear for optimal discrimination",
    ".    we shall now explore the consequences of this conclusion . since @xmath43 ( @xmath53 are collinear , the failure space , @xmath23 , is one dimensional . if @xmath54 is the basis vector spanning this hilbert space we can write the failure vectors as @xmath55 . substituting this representation of the failure vectors into eq .",

    "positivity requires that the diagonal matrix elements of the submatrix be non - negative , so that it must be true that @xmath77 and @xmath78 . without loss of generality",

    "doing so and imposing the condition that @xmath77 guarantees that the condition @xmath81 is also satisfied , and together they imply that the trace is greater than or equal to zero .",
    "the condition that the determinant be non - negative gives us a lower bound on @xmath82 , @xmath83 we want to interpret this inequality , in particular , we want to find what the right - hand side is equal to . in order to do so",

    ", the optimal measurements transform into one another continuously .",
    "furthermore , each of the two von neumann expressions can be written as the arithmetic mean of two terms and the povm result as the geometric mean of the same two terms .",

    "the usual problem considered when trying to unambiguously discriminate among quantum states is to correctly identify which state a given system is in when one knows the set of possible states in which it can be prepared .",
    "here we have considered a different problem .",
    "the set of possible states is divided into two subsets , and we only want to know to which subset the quantum state of our given system belongs . as this is a less ambitious task than actually identifying the state , we expect that our probability to be successful will be greater for attaining this more limited goal .",
    "we considered the simplest instance of this problem , the situation in which we are trying to discriminate between a set containing one quantum state and another containing two . a method for finding the optimal strategy for discriminating between these two sets",
    "was presented , and analytical solutions for particular cases were given .",
    "in addition , we have shown that if the quantum states are single - photon states , where the photon can be split among several modes , the optimal discrimination strategy can be implemented by using a linear optical network .",
    "these ideas can be extended in a number of different ways .",
    "one possibility is to consider the situation in which one is given @xmath3 qubits , each of which is in either the state @xmath45 of @xmath46 , where these states are not orthogonal .",
    "what we would like to know is how many of the qubits are in the state @xmath45 .",
    "in order to phrase this problem in a way that makes its connection to the problems considered in this paper clear , we note that the total set of possible states for this problem consists of @xmath241 states ( the states are strings of @xmath3 qubits ) , and this can be divided up into the subsets @xmath242 , where the members of @xmath242 are sequences of @xmath3 qubits in which @xmath243 are in the state @xmath45 . for a given sequence of qubits ,",
    "our problem is to determine to which of the sets @xmath242 it belongs .",
    "another possibility is to use these methods to compare strings of qubits in order to find out if they are identical or not . again",
    ", suppose that we have strings of @xmath3 qubits in which each qubit is in one of the two non - orthogonal states , @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "we are given two of these strings and want to know if they are the same or not .",
    "in this case , our set of possible states consists of pairs of strings , and hence has @xmath244 members .",
    "this is divided into two subsets , the first , @xmath245 , consisting of pairs of identical @xmath3-qubit strings ( @xmath246 members ) , and its complement , @xmath247 , consisting of everything else .",
    "our task , when given two sequences of @xmath3 qubits , is to decide if they are in @xmath245 or in @xmath247 @xcite .",
    "more detailed consideration of these problems remains for future research .",
    "we want to thank s. barnett , a. chefles , u. herzog and i. jex for helpful discussions of various aspects of this problem .",
    "this research was supported by the office of naval research ( grant number : n00014 - 92j-1233 ) , by the national science foundation ( grant number : phy-9970507 ) , by the hungarian science research fund ( otka , grant number : t 030671 ) and by a grant from psc - cuny as well as by a cuny collaborative grant .",
    "in this section , we shall show that by using the method of lagrange multipliers , we can derive the conclusions contained in eqs .",
    "( [ result1])-([q3 ] ) rigorously , starting from the fact that for optimal discrimination , the vectors @xmath43 must be linearly dependent . to express this statement in a compact form we define the positive semidefinite matrix @xmath248 , where @xmath249 .",
    "then , in general , if @xmath43 ( @xmath53 are linearly dependent , the determinant of matrix @xmath248 must vanish , @xmath250 @xcite . with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ q_i ] ) and  ( [ phi_1213 ] ) , we can eliminate two of the three overlaps from the matrix @xmath248 and obtain explicitly @xmath251 here @xmath252 again denotes @xmath253 , @xmath254 is the remaining overlap where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are to be determined from the conditions for optimum , and @xmath255 .",
    "since @xmath248 is positive semidefinite , all the diagonal subdeterminants of @xmath256 must be non - negative .",
    "we now wish to minimize the average probability of failure @xmath117 , eq .",
    "( [ psf ] ) , subject to the constraint in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "this can be done by minimizing the quantity @xmath257 where @xmath258 is a lagrange multiplier .",
    "the conditions for minimum with respect to @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath259 and @xmath260 , lead immediately to @xmath261 the solutions of these equations , corresponding to the minimum of @xmath117 , are @xmath262 and @xmath263 next , we perform the optimization with respect to the remaining variables . notice that the derivative of @xmath264 with respect to @xmath258 returns eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "therefore , we use the optimal values of @xmath123 and @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) and in the conditions for minimum with respect to the failure probabilities , @xmath265 for @xmath163 . after some algebra we obtain the following set of equations @xmath266 where @xmath267 and @xmath268 are the diagonal subdeterminants of @xmath256 , @xmath269    we now have four variables @xmath270 , and @xmath258 , and four equations , eqs .",
    "( [ delta2])([e6 ] ) , to find them .",
    "( [ delta2 ] ) tells us that at least one of the diagonal subdeterminants vanishes . with no loss of generality we can assume this to be @xmath271 . comparing this to eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) we see that @xmath258 must be singular .",
    "the singularity , however , is tractable since the same equation tells us that the product @xmath272 is finite .",
    "then it follows from the singular behavior of @xmath258 and eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) that the other diagonal subdeterminant also vanishes , @xmath273 , but the product @xmath272 also remains finite . using these finite values from eqs .",
    "( [ e5])([e6 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) , we can summarize our findings as follows @xmath274 which is just equation  ( [ twodeltas ] ) , and @xmath275 multiplying eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) by @xmath267 ( or eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) by @xmath268 ) and taking into account eq .",
    "( [ twodeltas2 ] ) gives that the singularity in @xmath258 is such that @xmath276 .",
    "using this in eq .",
    "( [ delta6 ] ) we finally obtain @xmath277 this is the solution found in section ii , eq .  ( [ q1opt ] ) , and the rest of section ii follows from here and eq .",
    "( [ twodeltas2 ] ) .    for the sake of completeness we also give the expression for @xmath278 , @xmath279 which exhibits no singularity .",
    "in fact , @xmath280 when @xmath281 , as expected . finally , let us note that eq .",
    "( [ twodeltas2 ] ) , which is identical to eq .",
    "( [ twodeltas ] ) , implies that all of the failure vectors , @xmath43 , are parallel to each other , i. e. they lie in a space , @xmath23 , of dimension one .",
