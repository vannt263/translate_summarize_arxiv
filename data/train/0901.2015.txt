    "the study of plasma flows for regulating the turbulence and anomalous transport has in recent years attracted strong interest  @xcite .",
    "the regulation of drift wave turbulence by sheared flows is due to shearing of the turbulent eddies and thereby reducing the spatial scales of the eddies . of particular interest among the plasma flows",
    "are the so called zonal flows  @xcite which are self generated from the background turbulence via reynolds stress .",
    "unlike the sheared mean flows which have equilibrium scale size the zonal flows are random @xmath1 flows mainly in the poloidal direction with low frequency and thus are almost stationary compared to the time scale of the background turbulence .",
    "since the zonal flows are quasistationary compared to the background turbulence they may keep decorrelating turbulent eddies for a relatively long time and thereby effectively suppressing the turbulent transport .",
    "the drift waves that are driven by gradients in the plasma density , temperature , magnetic field etc are responsible for causing turbulence and anomalous transport .",
    "candidates of such drift waves are the ion - temperature - gradient mode ( itg ) and the collisionless trapped electron mode ( tem ) .    in the present paper",
    "the direct effects of a sheared mean flow on the zonal flow instability are investigated analytically , however , the effects on the background turbulence itself is not considered in this work . moreover ,",
    "the effect of the parallel ion motion on the zonal flow growth rate and frequency is studied .",
    "the zonal flow generation from nonlinear interactions among drift waves has been extensively investigated both analytically  @xcite-  @xcite and in computer simulations using gyrokinetic  @xcite-  @xcite and advanced fluid models  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of micro - scale electron temperature gradient ( etg ) driven turbulence driven zonal flow on semi - macro scale itg turbulence was studied by a fluid simulation  @xcite .",
    "however , the direct interaction of zonal flow with a sheared mean flow and the interaction with the gam have mostly been overlooked .",
    "there have been some previous studies on the interaction of zonal flows and mean flows using simple drift wave models  @xcite and using the coherent mode coupling method  @xcite .",
    "the present work extends the drift wave model to an advanced fluid model for the toroidal itg mode turbulence while using the wave kinetic approach .",
    "the purpose of this study is to obtain a qualitative estimate of the zonal flow growth rate and real frequency , and their parametric dependence of the plasma under the influence of a sheared mean flow and parallel ion motion .",
    "the effects of sheared mean flows and parallel ion motion on zonal flows is not well known as well as how it is influencing the turbulence and in the end how this effect may change the overall transport .",
    "however the full non - linear effects of the geodesic acoustic mode ( gam )  @xcite is out of the scope of the present study .",
    "the gam is a perturbation where the electrostatic potential ( @xmath2 mode ) is coupled to the sideband density perturbations ( @xmath3 mode ) by toroidal effects .",
    "the gam interacts with the zonal flow and act as a source or sink for the poloidal flow leading to an oscillatory nature of the zonal flow .",
    "the complete role of gams are still not well understood  @xcite-  @xcite . for these reasons it is of great importance to study",
    "the four component system of drift waves , sheared mean flow , gam and zonal flow .",
    "the methodology of the analytical model is based on the wave kinetic approach  @xcite ,  @xcite-  @xcite .",
    "an algebraic equation which describes the zonal flow growth rate and real frequency including the effects of a sheared mean flow in the presence of maternal itg turbulence including the effects of parallel ion motion is derived and solved numerically .",
    "an advanced fluid model including the ion continuity , ion temperature equations and the ion momentum equation is used for the background itg turbulence  @xcite .",
    "the generation of zonal flows is described by the vorticity equation and the time evolution of the itg turbulence in the presence of the slowly growing zonal flow is described by a wave kinetic equation .",
    "it was found the generation of zonal flows was in general suppressed by a sheared mean flow . by introducing collisional damping a modest suppression of the zonal flow growth rate",
    "in addition , it is found that the interaction with parallel iom momentum may reduce the zf generation significantly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the analytical model for the zonal flows generated from toroidal itg modes including the effects of a sheared mean flow is reviewed .",
    "the analytical model is extended to include parallel ion motion in section iii .",
    "section iv is dedicated to the results and a discussion thereof .",
    "finally there is a summary in section v.",
    "in this section the model excluding parallel ion motion is introduced .",
    "the description used for toroidal itg driven modes consists of the ion continuity and ion temperature equations . for simplicity ,",
    "effects of electron trapping and finite beta are neglected in this work .",
    "magnetic shear can , however , modify the non - linear upshift as found in ref .",
    "@xcite-  @xcite and is accordingly incorporated in the model including parallel ion motion . in this section the model of how to construct the interaction of a sheared flow and the zonal flows generated from itg driven turbulence and the derivation of the dispersion relation for zonal flows are summarized .",

    "in addition , unlike the damping , the sheared mean flow is also responsible for a significant suppression of the zonal flow growth rate for small @xmath111-values to a certain minimum level determined by the background turbulence . if the background is considered to be close to the marginal state a total suppression of the zonal flow growth rate is found .",
    "note that the effect of mean flow is included in the product of @xmath127 and @xmath123 , namely the shearing rate .",

    "<S> the present work investigates the direct interaction of sheared mean flow with zonal flows ( zf ) and the effect of parallel ion motion on zf generation in ion - temperature - gradient ( itg ) background turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical model for the direct interaction of sheared mean flows with zonal flows is constructed . the model used for the toroidal itg driven mode </S>",
    "<S> is based on the equations for ion continuity , ion temperature and parallel ion motion whereas the zf evolution is described by the vorticity equation . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the zf growth rate and real frequency is examined for typical tokamak parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in general the zonal flow growth rate is suppressed by the presence of a sheared mean flow . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , with parallel ion motion effects the zfs become more oscillatory for increasing @xmath0 value .    </S>",
