    "1992,1994 ) , tells us that the universe must have reached a high state of ionization by the redshift of the most distant known quasars , around five .",
    "several mechanisms for reionization , which requires a source of ultra - violet photons , have been discussed , and are extensively reviewed by haiman & knox ( 1999 ) . in the two most popular models ,",
    "the sources are massive stars in the first generation of galaxies , or early generations of quasars , and these models have seen quite extensive investigation ( couchman & rees 1986 ; shapiro & giroux 1987 ; donahue & shull 1991 amongst others ) .",
    "other possibilities are that the reionization is caused by the release of energy from a late - decaying particle , usually thought to be a neutrino @xcite , mechanical heating from supernovae driven winds ( schwartz , ostriker & yahil 1975 ; ikeuchi 1981 ; ostriker & cowie 1981 ) or even by cosmic rays ( ginsburg & ozernoi 1965 ; nath & bierman 1993 ) or by radiation from evaporating primordial black holes @xcite .",
    "one of the most important consequences of reionization is the effect on the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , again reviewed by haiman & knox ( 1999 ) . before reionization ,",
    "the microwave background photons have insufficient energy to interact with the atoms , but after reionization they can scatter from the liberated electrons .",
    "this leads both to a distortion of the blackbody spectrum and to a damping of the observed anisotropies .",
    "typically , the number density of electrons after reionization is low enough that only a fraction of the photons are rescattered , so that some fraction of the original anisotropy is preserved .",
    "there has been continuing rapid progress in observations of microwave background anisotropies , and it is now well established that there is a rise in the spectrum around angular scales of one degree or so , which is where one expects to see the first acoustic ( or doppler ) peak . while the issue of whether or not there is an actual peak , with the spectrum falling off again on yet smaller angular scales , remains somewhat controversial , the existence of significant perturbations on the degree scale already indicates that reionization can not have occurred extremely early , as that would have wiped out the anisotropy signal .",
    "a detailed analysis of the current constraints on reionization is our purpose in this paper .",
    "the earliest analysis of this type was made by de bernardis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and more recently adams et al .",
    "( 1998 ) made a specific application to the decaying neutrino model .",
    "we will work within the class of generalized cold dark matter ( cdm ) models .",
    "we consider a subset , where the dark matter is cold and the spatial geometry flat , and we assume that the initial perturbations are gaussian and adiabatic , with a power - law form , as predicted by the simplest models of inflation .",
    "qualitatively , the cobe dmr detections ( smoot et al .",
    "1992 ; bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) provided evidence supporting this class of models , by showing that large angular scale fluctuations have a spectrum close to a scale - invariant one .",
    "comparison with a range of observations , including the galaxy cluster number density and the galaxy power spectrum , have led to several different recipes aiming at concordance , with the cdm models presently providing the best framework for understanding the evolution of structure in the universe .",

    "we fix the baryon density using nucleosynthesis ( schramm & turner 1998 ) .",
    "the parameters we vary are therefore the matter density @xmath0 , the hubble parameter @xmath1 and the spectral index @xmath2 of the density perturbations . in this paper , we constrain the amount of reionization as a function of these parameters , by carrying out a goodness - of - fit test against a compilation of microwave anisotropy data . we do not consider the related question of finding the overall best - fitting parameters , and in particular of whether the favoured parameter regions are much altered by the inclusion of reionization , leaving that to future work .",
    "first we briefly review the relation between reionization redshift and the optical depth . the effect on the microwave background anisotropies",
    "is mainly determined by the optical depth to scattering , and does nt depend too much on the exact reionization history ; for illustration we will imagine that the universe makes a rapid transition from neutrality to complete ionization .",
    "if the electron number density is @xmath5 , and the thomson scattering cross - section @xmath6 , then the optical depth @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the present time . to obtain it as a function of redshift",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "first we define the ionization fraction @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the proton density . assuming a 24% primordial helium fraction , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the baryon number density , the present value of which is related to the baryon density parameter by @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the proton mass and @xmath16 the hubble parameter in the usual units . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that helium is fully ionized as well as hydrogen ; allowing for helium to be only singly ionized is a small correction ( as indeed is allowing for the neutrons at all ) .",
    "two useful relations are the redshift evolution of the electron number density @xmath17 and the time ",
    "redshift relation @xmath18 they give @xmath19 where the ` 0 ' indicates the present value .",
    "as long as the dominant matter is non - relativistic @xmath20 and we can write @xmath21 where @xmath22 the last equality following simply by substituting in for all the constants , with the usual definition of the hubble constant @xmath1 . a useful equation for the redshift dependence of @xmath23 , again assuming only non - relativistic matter and a flat spatial geometry , is @xmath24     +    for illustration we will assume instantaneous reionization at @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 for @xmath27 and zero otherwise . equation  ( [ e : tauz ] ) can then be integrated to give @xmath28 \\,.\\ ] ] sample curves are shown in figure  [ tau_z ] . inserting the latest permitted reionization redshift , @xmath29 from the gunn  peterson effect , implies only that @xmath7 exceeds a percent or two for typical cosmological parameters . in order to give an optical depth of unity",
    ", the epoch of reionization would be at @xmath30 therefore , we should expect reionization to occur somewhere between @xmath31 .",
    "estimating the reionization redshift theoretically remains an uncertain business .",
    "structure formation in the cdm framework is hierarchical , with the smallest gravitationally - bound systems forming first and the bigger ones appearing later , by merging of the smaller structures .",
    "when the first fluctuations enter the non - linear growth regime sometime after @xmath32 ( peebles 1983 ) , we expect the appearance of the first bound objects and therefore , the possible onset of reionization . in most reionization models ,",
    "the assumed recipe is that baryons fall into the potential wells of the developing structures in the cold dark matter , forming stars and quasars which emit ultraviolet radiation .",
    "when this radiation escapes the galaxies , it will ionize and heat the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and the usual calculations aim to estimate when sufficient radiation is available to complete the reionization .",
    "this is already a complex and uncertain calculation , made more so if one allows for inhomogeneities which can strongly affect the recombination rate ( carr , bond & arnett 1984 ) .",
    "further , we should note that other heating contributions are not currently excluded ( stebbins & silk 1986 ; tegmark , silk & blanchard 1994 ; tegmark & silk 1995 ) and may even be necessary . indeed , it has been claimed from observations of the present uv background that it may have been insufficient to reionize the igm ( giroux & shapiro 1994 ) , suggesting that collisional heating from supernovae - driven winds or cosmic rays could also contribute to early reionization .",
    "density perturbation growth slows down with time , and structures in low - density universes cease growing around @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , given the present observed matter power spectrum , this implies that galaxies formed much earlier in low matter density universes .",
    "consequently , reionization is expected to occur earlier in low - density models and , given the bigger look - back time , the optical depth will be larger .",
    "the most extensive theoretical calculations , based on the press  schechter mass function , tend to show that reionization occurred after @xmath34 , and that a good guess for most models would be @xmath35 ( fukugita & kawasaki 1994 ; tegmark et al .",
    "1994 ; liddle & lyth 1995 ; tegmark & silk 1995 ) .",
    "low - density models are towards the top of this range and critical - density ones towards the lower end ( liddle & lyth 1995 ) .",
    "these results have some corroboration from numerical simulations ( haiman & loeb 1997 ) .",
    "specifically , for @xmath36cdm models , ostriker & gnedin ( 1996 ) and baltz , gnedin & silk ( 1997 ) show that reionization by population iii stars should have sufficed to reionize the igm by @xmath37 , although recently haiman ( 1998 ) suggested a lower reionization redshift of around @xmath38 for a flat low - density model .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then besides the determination of @xmath39 via damping of the cmb anisotropies by cmb satellites map and planck , the reionization redshift can be measured _",
    "directly _ from the spectra of individual sources with the next generation space telescope ( haiman & loeb 1998 ) or with 21 cm `` tomography '' with the giant meterwave radio telescope ( madau , meiksin & rees 1997 ) .    in summary , the theoretical uncertainties in estimating the reionization redshift are large , and the plausible range stretches from just above the gunn",
    " peterson limit of @xmath40 up to perhaps @xmath41 .      in the thomson limit , where the incident photon energy in the electron rest frame is much less than the electron rest mass  energy , the blackbody form",
    "is preserved by scattering . however , the spectrum is measured so accurately that one can hope to detect deviations ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 ) .",
    "the best - known example is the sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect in clusters , which is detectable because of the very high electron temperatures in clusters .",
    "the reionized intergalactic medium is much cooler , but there is much more of it .",
    "the amount of distortion of the cmb spectrum is defined through the compton @xmath42 parameter ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 ; stebbins & silk 1986 ; bartlett & stebbins 1991 ) : @xmath43 at the epochs of interest , the cmb temperature is negligible compared to the electron temperature , which we measure in units of @xmath44 kelvin , denoted @xmath45 . if the electron temperature is taken as constant , this is the same integral as that giving the optical depth , apart from the prefactor .    with the current limits on this distortion coming from the firas experiment , @xmath46 ( fixsen et al .",
    "1996 ) , this implies , for typical parameters , @xmath47 for the expected typical temperature evolution of the intergalactic medium , it is hard to say much solely from the spectral distortions about the reionization epoch , except that the universe must have undergone a neutral phase .",
    "stebbins & silk ( 1986 ) , bartlett & stebbins ( 1991 ) , sethi & nath ( 1997 ) and more recently weller , battye & albrecht ( 1998 ) show that almost no reasonable reionized cosmological model violates current spectral distortion constraints .",
    "therefore , the information coming from the spatial damping of cmb anisotropies , rather than from spectral distortions , is crucial to determine the history of the reionization epoch , and from now we focus on the anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "as stated in the introduction , our aim is to constrain the epoch of reionization for a range of spatially - flat cosmological models .",
    "we fix the baryon density at @xmath48 from nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "this is at the high end of values currently considered , which makes it a conservative choice because decreasing the baryon density lowers the acoustic peak and hence permits less reionization .",
    "we also do not consider tensor perturbations , which contribute predominantly to the low multipoles . as with the baryons , our constraints are conservative in that they would strengthen",
    "if tensors were included , because including them lowers the acoustic peaks relative to the low-@xmath49 plateau .",
    "the three parameters we vary are    * @xmath0 in the range @xmath50 .",
    "* @xmath1 in the range @xmath51 . *",
    "@xmath2 in the range @xmath52 .",
    "our focus is directed towards obtaining upper limits on the amount of reionization , though in some parts of parameter space there are lower limits too .",
    "the quantity to be compared with observation is the radiation angular power spectrum @xmath53 , which needs to be computed for each model .",
    "the spherical harmonic index @xmath49 indicates roughly the angular size probed , @xmath54 .",
    "the power spectrum is readily calculated using the cmbfast program @xcite , which allows the input of all the parameters we need . however , exploring a multi - dimensional parameter space is computationally quite intensive , and rather than run cmbfast for every choice of the optical depth , it is more efficient and flexible to use an analytic approximation to the effect of reionization .",
    "this enables us to quickly and accurately generate @xmath53 spectra for arbitrary amounts of reionization .",
    "the first step is to obtain spectra for the case with no reionization , for each combination of our three parameters .",
    "we take our parameters on a discrete grid of dimensions @xmath55 . from these spectra without reionization , we can generate spectra including reionization using a version of the reionization damping envelope technique of hu & white .",
    "this procedure readily generates accurate enough spectra for comparison with the current observational data , as we will show .",
    "however , we do caution the reader that this approach will not work once data of improved accuracy becomes available .",
    "indeed , as shown by the herculean 8-parameter analysis of tegmark ( 1999 ) , the error bars on the cosmological parameters coming from the cmb do nt seem to change very much with the addition of more parameters ( see also lineweaver 1998 ) and in the near future the advent of better quality data will make them decrease , introducing the necessity for a refined treatment of reionization .",
    "the underlying physics is the following , illustrated in figure  [ f : rescatt ] . given an optical depth @xmath7 , the probability that a photon we see originated at the original last - scattering surface is @xmath56 , the exponential accounting for multiple scatterings .",
    "those photons will still carry the original anisotropy , which we will denote by @xmath57 .",
    "the remaining fraction will have scattered at least once .",
    "their contribution to the anisotropy depends on scale . on large angular scales",
    ", they will have rescattered within the same large region and will continue to share the same temperature contrast ; this is simply a statement that causality prevents large - scale anisotropies being removed . on small scales , however , the rescattered photons come from many different regions with different small - scale temperature contrasts ( the small circle in figure  [ f : rescatt ] ) , and their anisotropy averages to zero . consequently we have two limiting behaviours for the observed anisotropy @xmath58 @xmath59 the factor 2 in the latter is because the power spectrum is the square of the temperature anisotropy .",
    "+    the reionization damping envelope @xcite is a fitting function which interpolates between these two regimes . for a given @xmath7",
    ", we obtain the observed spectrum by @xmath60 where the reionization damping envelope @xmath61 is given in terms of the optical depth and a characteristic scale @xmath62 by @xcite @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the characteristic scale comes from the angular scale subtended by the horizon when the photons rescatter ( i.e.  that subtended by the circle in figure  [ f : rescatt ] ) . in order to obtain a highly accurate result , hu & white compute the characteristic scale @xmath62 via an integral which weights the horizon scale with the optical depth , but for our purposes the simple formula @xmath69 gives sufficient accuracy , where @xmath39 is given by rearranging equation  ( [ e : tauz2 ] )",
    "this formula is a fit to the angular size of the horizon at reionization ( hu & white 1997 , with a sign error in their paper corrected ) .",
    "= 6.15 cm +    we are not quite finished yet , because while the reionization damping envelope accounts for the loss of anisotropy due to scattering , it does not allow for the generation of new anisotropies because of the peculiar velocities of the rescattering electrons .",
    "these create a new , but much less prominent , acoustic peak at smaller @xmath49 than the original one .",
    "because it is a minor feature , it can be modelled simply using a gaussian , the amplitude , width and location of which depend mildly on the cosmology .",
    "the form we choose gives the reionized spectrum as @xmath70 where @xmath71 the various numerical factors were fits from a comparison to cmbfast output in specific cases .",
    "this approach is easily accurate enough given the current data , especially as the data are given in @xmath72 which corresponds to the square root of the @xmath53 curve .",
    "figure  [ f : cl_test ] shows an example compared to an exact curve from cmbfast .",
    "in recent years the detection of cmb anisotropies on different angular scales has become commonplace . at large scales ,",
    "the cobe measurements @xcite constrained the amplitude of the spectrum with high accuracy , and to some extent the slope . since then , a plethora of ground - based and balloon - borne experiments probing medium and small scales have followed , providing increasingly accurate measurements .",
    "although there is still quite a large scatter , there is very strong evidence for the existence of an acoustic peak at @xmath49 of a few hundred , as first claimed by scott & white ( 1994 ) and by hancock & rocha ( 1997 ) , and therefore a limit on the amount of reionization damping which is permitted .",
