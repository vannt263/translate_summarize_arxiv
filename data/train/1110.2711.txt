    "@xcite  the occurrence of cohesive modules of nodes  is of particular interest as it provides an insight into not only structural organization but also functional behavior of various real - world systems  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of communities has thus been the focus of many recent endeavors  @xcite , while community structure analysis is also considered as one of the most prominent areas of network science  @xcite .",
    "however , most of the past work was constrained to communities characterized by higher density of links_link - density communities _",
    "@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig_comms_zkc ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the latter , recent studies reveal that networks comprise even more sophisticated modules than classical cohesive communities  @xcite .",
    "in particular , real - world networks can also be naturally partitioned according to common patterns of connections among nodes  into _ link - pattern communities _",
    "@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig_comms_swc ] ) .",
    "link - pattern communities can in fact be related to relevant functional roles in various complex systems  @xcite , moreover , they also provide a further comprehension of real - world network structure that is obscure under classical frameworks .",
    "note that link - density communities could be seen as a special case of link - pattern communities , although several fundamental differences exist  @xcite .",
    "in particular , link - pattern communities do not correspond to densely connected groups of nodes , while generally do not even feature connectedness .",
    "the latter actually implies low transitivity  clustering coefficient  @xcite  for the nodes in link - pattern communities , which contradicts with small - world phenomena  @xcite .",
    "however , recent work suggests that best link - pattern communities might indeed emerge in parts of networks that exhibit low values of clustering ( e.g. , technological networks ) , where small - world property does not generally hold  @xcite .",
    "recently , ubelj  and  bajec  @xcite have proposed a general propagation algorithm that can reveal arbitrary network modules ranging from link - density to link - pattern communities .",
    "their algorithm does not require any prior knowledge of the true structure , though they introduce a community parameter that models the nature of each community according to the measure of network bottlenecks  conductance  @xcite .",
    "we advance the latter by proposing a more adequate modeling strategy based on node clustering coefficient  @xcite .",
    "the resulting algorithm is evaluated on various synthetic benchmark networks with planted partition , on random graphs and also resolution limit examples .",
    "it is shown to be comparable to current state - of - the - art , whereas , the proposed strategy also greatly improves on the approach of  ubelj  and  bajec  @xcite ( on these networks ) . furthermore , to demonstrate its generality , we also employ the algorithm for community detection in different unipartite and bipartite real - world networks , for generalized community detection and predictive data clustering .    the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in  section  [ sec_rw ]",
    "we briefly review relevant related work , with emphasis on the community detection literature .",
    "section  [ sec_alg ] introduces the proposed algorithm , while the empirical evaluation with formal discussion is done in  section  [ sec_eval ] .",
    "the performance on various real - world examples is presented in  section  [ sec_rwe ] , and conclusions are made in  section  [ sec_conc ] .",
    "despite the wealth of the literature on classical communities in recent years  @xcite , only a small number of authors have considered more general link - pattern communities .",
    "nevertheless , authors have recently proposed different algorithms based on stochastic blockmodels  @xcite , mixture models  @xcite , model selection  @xcite , data clustering  @xcite and other  @xcite . however , in contrast to the propagation algorithm proposed in this paper , and that in  @xcite , all other approaches require some prior knowledge of the true structure ( e.g. , the number of communities ) .",
    "the latter indeed seriously limits their use in practice .",
    "note that authors have also analyzed vertex similarity based on common patterns of connections  @xcite  commonly referred to as _",

    "@xcite in social networks literature .",
    "these have been extensively studied in the past , however , their main focus and employed formulation differs from ours .",
    "let the network be represented by an undirected graph @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of nodes of the graph and @xmath2 is the set of its links ( edges ) .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath3 be the weight of the link between nodes @xmath4",
    ". moreover , let @xmath5 denote the community ( label ) of node @xmath6 , and let @xmath7 be the set of its neighbors .",
    "the proposed model - based propagation algorithm is , as the algorithm in  @xcite , based on the label propagation principle of  raghavan  et  al .",
    "@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we thus first introduce the latter .    [",
    "[ label - propagation . ] ] label propagation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    label propagation algorithm  @xcite ( lpa ) reveals link - density communities by exploiting the following procedure .",
    "first , each node @xmath6 is labeled with a unique label ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) .",
    "then , at each iteration , the node adopts the label shared by most of its neighbors ( with respect to link weights ) .",
    "hence , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the set of neighbors of node @xmath11 that share label @xmath12 ( ties are broken uniformly at random ) .",
    "due to the existence of many intra - community links , relative to the number of inter - community links , cohesive modules of nodes form a consensus on some label after a few iterations . thus ,",
    "when the algorithm converges  a local equilibrium is reached ",
    "disconnected sets of nodes sharing the same label are classified into the same community . due to extremely fast structural inference of label propagation ,",
    "the algorithm exhibits near linear complexity and can easily scale to networks with millions of nodes and links  @xcite .",
    "note that , to address issues with oscillations of labels in some networks ( e.g. , bipartite networks ) , label updates in  eq .",
    "( [ eq_lpa ] ) occur in a random order  @xcite .",
    "[ [ general - propagation . ] ] general propagation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    ubelj  and  bajec  @xcite have argued that label propagation can not be directly applied for the detection of link - pattern communities , as the bare nature of propagation requires connected ( and cohesive ) groups of nodes .",
    "however , when one considers second order neighborhoods , and propagates labels through nodes neighbors , link - pattern communities indeed correspond to cohesive modules of nodes ( see  fig .  [ fig_comms_swc ] ) . based on the above they",
    "have proposed general propagation algorithm  @xcite ( gpa ) that is presented in the following .",
    "let @xmath13 be a community parameter that models the nature of community @xmath14 , @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "assume @xmath13 equals @xmath16 and @xmath17 for link - density and link - pattern communities , respectively ( to be properly defined later ) .",
    "label propagation in  eq .",
    "( [ eq_lpa ] ) is then advanced into a general community detection algorithm as @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the strength of node @xmath6 ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) . in the case of link - density communities ( left - hand side of  eq .",
    "( [ eq_mpa ] ) ) , the labels are propagated among the neighbors as before , whereas , in the case of link - pattern communities ( right - hand side of  eq .",
    "( [ eq_mpa ] ) ) , the labels are propagated through nodes neighbors  between the nodes at distance two .",
    "thus , the algorithm can indeed reveal either link - density or link - pattern communities , or different mixtures of both , when they are clearly depicted in the network s topology .",
    "( note that in  @xcite the algorithm was presented for unweighted networks . )",
    "node balancers @xmath22  @xcite and diffusion values @xmath23 , @xmath24  @xcite in  eq .",
    "( [ eq_mpa ] ) improve the algorithm s stability and accuracy , respectively .",
    "more precisely , random label update orders ( see above ) severely hamper the robustness of the approach , and consequently also the stability of the identified community structure  @xcite .",
    "in particular , nodes that are updated at the beginning exhibit higher propagation preferences than those that are updated towards the end  @xcite .",
    "thus , balancers @xmath22 are utilized to counteract for the randomness introduced by update orders  lower and higher preferences are given to the nodes updated first and last , respectively .",
    "let @xmath25 denote a normalized position of node @xmath6 in some random order , @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "then , node balancers are set according to @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are parameters of the algorithm .",
    "intuitively , we fix @xmath28 to @xmath30 , while @xmath29 is set to @xmath31 based on some preliminary experiments ( see  section  [ sec_eval ] ) .",
    "node balancers can also be modeled with a linear function as @xmath32 , however , introduction of the above parameters allows for a distinct control over the algorithm .",
    "in particular , analysis in  section  [ sec_eval ] reveals that increasing @xmath29 improves the stability of the algorithm , although the computational time thus also increases .",
    "note also that setting @xmath29 to @xmath17 yields a classical label propagation where all @xmath22 are equal .    to further boost the community detection strength of the algorithm , defensive preservation of communities",
    "is employed through diffusion values @xmath23 , @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "here higher diffusion values  propagation preferences  are given to core nodes of each ( current ) community , while lower values are given to their border nodes .",
    "the latter results in an immense ability of detecting communities , even when they are only weakly depicted in the network s topology  @xcite . at each iteration ,",
    "diffusion values are estimated by means of a random walker utilized on each ( current ) community .",
    "hence , @xmath33 and @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the intra - community degree of node @xmath6 ( all @xmath23 , @xmath24 are initialized to @xmath36 ) . besides deriving an estimate of the core and border of each community",
    ", the main rationale here is to formulate propagation  diffusion  within each community , to estimate the current state of label propagation , and then to adequately alter the dynamics of the process .",
    "analysis in  section  [ sec_eval ] reveals that defensive preservation of communities significantly improves the detection strength of the algorithm , while for further discussion and analysis see  @xcite .    despite the discussion above",
    ", the core of the algorithm is in fact represented by a community modeling strategy implemented through parameters @xmath13 .",
    "ubelj  and  bajec  @xcite have proposed to measure the conductance  @xcite of each community , to determine whether it better conforms with link - density or link - pattern regime .",
    "conductance  @xmath37 of community @xmath14 is defined as a relative size of the corresponding network cut  ratio of inter - community links  thus it is a measure of network bottlenecks .",
    "hence , at each iteration , they simply set @xmath38 , while all @xmath13 are initialized to @xmath30 .",
    "the main weakness of their strategy is that each community is considered independently of other .",
    "thus , in the following , we propose a more adequate  community modeling strategy based on the properties of complex real - world networks .",
    "[ [ model - based - propagation . ] ] model - based propagation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    community modeling strategy of  ubelj  and  bajec  @xcite considers merely the nature of each respective community , whereas all other communities are disregarded .",
    "although no proper empirical study exists , in an ideal case , link - pattern communities would link to other link - pattern communities rather than to other link - density communities .",
    "the latter follows from the fact that the concerned links would else obviously decrease the quality of the respective link - density community  make it a link - pattern community .",
    "thus , we propose a community model based on the hypothesis that the neighbors communities should be of the same type  either link - density or link - pattern  as the concerned node s community .",
    "hence , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the degree of node @xmath6 and @xmath41 is the set of nodes in community  @xmath14 .",
    "we also argue that an adequate initialization of community parameters @xmath13 is of vital importance ( exact results are omitted ) .",
    "otherwise , the algorithm can easily get trapped in some local stable  probably suboptimal  fixed point that is hard to escape from .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ eq_delta ] ) can not be directly employed at the beginning , as all nodes still reside in their own communities .",
    "we thus refine the above hypothesis such that the node s neighbors should not only reside in the same type of the community , but in the same respective community .",
    "the latter immediately implies that the neighbors of the nodes in link - density communities should also link to each other , whereas the opposite holds for the nodes in link - pattern communities .",
    "hence , for each node @xmath6 , one could initially set @xmath42 to @xmath43 , where @xmath43 is a node clustering coefficient  @xcite defined as the probability that two neighbors of node @xmath11 also link to each other  network transitivity .",
    "it ought to be mentioned that recent work suggests that transitivity  rather than homophily  gives rise to the modular structure in real - world networks  @xcite .",
    "however , consider a node with very high degree  a hub node .",
    "hubs commonly appear in link - density communities  @xcite , still , due to a large number of links , they would only rarely experience high values of clustering coefficient ( the opposite would in fact imply a large clique ) . also , as most networks are disassortative by degree  @xcite ,",
    "hubs tend to link to low degree nodes that can not provide for high clustering of the hub node  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in many real - world networks node clustering coefficient roughly follows @xmath44  @xcite , where @xmath40 is the degree of node @xmath6 .",
    "hence , we model initial communities as ( assume @xmath45 )    [ eq_init]_c_n = 1 & for @xmath46 , + & otherwise ,    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are estimated from the network using ordinary least squares , and @xmath49 is a parameter .",
    "we set @xmath49 to @xmath50 based on some preliminary experiments .",
    "( [ eq_init ] )  and  eq .  ( [ eq_delta ] ) define the proposed model - based propagation algorithm ( mpa ) , which is else ( almost ) identical to the algorithm in  @xcite ( see  alg .  [ alg_mpa ] )",
    ". however , the evaluation on synthetic and real - world networks in  section  [ sec_eval ]  and  section  [ sec_rwe ] , respectively , reveals that the proposed approach significantly outperforms that  in  @xcite . for a thorough evaluation ,",
    "we also analyze two variations of the basic approach that fix all community parameters @xmath13 to either @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "the approaches thus result in a fully link - density or link - pattern community detection algorithms , and are denoted mpa(d )  and  mpa(p ) , respectively .",

    "in the following we evaluate the proposed algorithm on different synthetic benchmark networks with planted partition , and also on random networks . the results are assessed in terms of three different measures of community significance , borrowed from the field of information theory and community detection literature .",
    "let @xmath61 be a partition extracted by an algorithm and let @xmath62 be the known partition of the network ( corresponding random variables are @xmath51 and @xmath63 , respectively ) . first ",

    "last , for a better comprehension , we also adopt a more intuitive measure  fraction of correctly classified nodes  @xcite ( fcc)that is commonly adopted within community detection literature . the node is considered correctly classified , if it resides in the same community as at least one half of the nodes in its true community .",

    "community detection algorithms introduced in  section  [ sec_alg ] are compared against a greedy agglomerative optimization  @xcite of modularity  @xmath73  @xcite ( denoted mo(g ) ) a classical link - density community detection algorithm  and a mixture model with expectation - maximization  @xcite proposed by  newman  and  leicht  @xcite ( denoted mm(em ) ) .",
    "the latter can detect arbitrary network modules and is currently among state - of - the - art approaches for generalized community detection  @xcite .",
