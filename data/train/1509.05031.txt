    "quantum sheaf cohomology is a deep subject and at the same time a natural extension of the `` classical '' quantum cohomology developed by vafa , witten , kontsevich and others .",
    "however as many subjects that comes from physics , it is defined in general only at a physicist level of rigor .",
    "reecently , donagi and his collaborators achieved to provide a rigourous foundation of this subject in the case of toric varieties and their tangent bundles @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the second section is devoted to an overview on the subject , following @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as we shall see , a basic piece in the construction of a quantum sheaf cohomology is a so - called omalous bundle on the variety we start with .",
    "the last section is devoted to this subject , namely to the construction of stable omalous bundle on same classes of surfaces .",
    "we obtain new examples in rank @xmath1 on surfaces in @xmath2 of high degree .",
    "the main technique we use is the li - qin construction developed in @xcite . in the sequel of this paper @xcite we",
    "will be concerned with computational aspects of the quantum sheaf cohomology for the stable omalous bundles constructed here .",
    "the quantum cohomology is a formal deformation of the cohomology ring @xmath3 for a smooth algebraic variety @xmath4 . from the physical viewpoint it appears if one try to `` observe '' the variety",
    "@xmath4 not by its points , but by its rational curves .",
    "the result is a quantum product on @xmath5 $ ] where @xmath6 is a multi - index whose length is the rank of @xmath7 .",
    "the main ingredient in the construction is kontsevich s moduli space of stable maps @xmath8 which parametrize maps @xmath9 whose image has class @xmath10 .",
    "also , one should mention that the construction depend on a system of marked points , but we shall ignore this aspect here .    having the moduli space of stable maps , the construction of the quantum product on @xmath3 goes as follows : for two classes @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath13 the big deal is to define their quantum product @xmath14.\\ ] ] a first observation is that as consequence of poincare duality , it is enough to define the pairing @xmath15 for any class @xmath16",
    ". the pairing can be expanded as a formal sum @xmath17 where @xmath18 varies in the free part of @xmath19 .",
    "so , we are reduced to the computation of this triple product @xmath20 for each @xmath21 .",
    "this is done by pushing up the three @xmath22 in the cohomology of @xmath23 and by taking here the cup product of the resulting classes : @xmath24 where the push up map @xmath25 is constructed using the marked points .",
    "even in such a oversimplified picture , we must mention three great difficulties in the full story : first of all , the moduli space @xmath23 is not compact at the beginning and its compactification was obtained by kontsevich . secondly",
    ", this compactification is not a variety but a stack .",
    "thirdly , on the compactification one needs a so called virtual fundamental class which is used to give a rigorous meaning for the cup product on @xmath23 .",
    "all these difficulties were resolved for large classes of varieties .",
    "below are two simple examples : @xmath26[[q]]}{(x^{n+1}-q)}\\ ] ] @xmath27[[p , q]]}{(x^{n+1}-p , y^{m+1}-q)}.\\ ] ]      a rigorous foundation for the quantum cohomology for sheaves was introduced by donagi et al . in @xcite and @xcite in connection with the @xmath28 nonlinear sigma model .",
    "its construction is similar with that for varieties but has a sheaf @xmath29 on the variety @xmath4 as supplementary input .",
    "the sheaf @xmath29 has to satisfy certain constraint - the omality condition - @xmath30 which imply the vanishing of the green - schwarz anomaly .",
    "an important point is that the omality is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of a quantum sheaf cohomology for @xmath29 . as definition ,",
    "the quantum sheaf cohomology for @xmath29 is the structure of a quantum product on @xmath31.\\ ] ]    it is a deformation of the usual product on the cohomology of @xmath29 .",
    "for @xmath32 the quantum sheaf cohomology of @xmath29 is the `` classical '' quantum cohomology of @xmath4 as one can guess from the hodge decomposition .",
    "the construction goes along the same lines as in the `` classical '' case : one starts with two elements @xmath11 , @xmath12 @xmath33 and we want to define their quantum product @xmath34.\\ ] ] again by poinare duality it is enough to define the pairing @xmath15 for any class @xmath35 .",
    "finally we arrive at the same problem , namely the definition of @xmath20 for each @xmath21 .",
    "the next step is to push up the @xmath36 from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a certain sheaf over @xmath23 obtained from @xmath29 .",
    "for example , in an ideal situation when the moduli space @xmath23 were fine with classifying map @xmath40 then @xmath39 would be @xmath41 . anyway , even in the real world where @xmath23 is not fine , such an @xmath39 exists and the main point is that the omality of @xmath29 imply @xmath42 as consequence , if one starts with @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 then by pushing up the @xmath36 and taking cup product we arrive in @xmath46 , producing therefore the desired number @xmath20 .",
    "as one could remark , apart the difficulties connected with the `` classical '' quantum cohomology , at least to new problems can be seen : the construction of the bundle @xmath39 and the starting point , namely the construction of the omalous bundle @xmath29 in fact , the construction of a quantum sheaf cohomology is known in very few cases . in this section",
    "we shall review a result in this direction obtained by donagi et al . in @xcite concerning the quadric @xmath47 . as the starting point on the quadric , the above mentioned authors considers de bundle @xmath29 as cokernel in the following sequence : @xmath48 the left arrow above is given by a matrix of the form @xmath49 , where @xmath50 are @xmath51 complex matrices and @xmath52 , @xmath53 are homogenous coordinates on the two projective lines .",
    "note that the bundle @xmath29 is a deformation of @xmath54 which correspond to the special values @xmath55 and @xmath56 . with the previous notations , the result proved by donagi et al .",
    "is :    for the quadric @xmath57 and the sheaf @xmath29 above , the quantum sheaf cohomology is : @xmath58[[p , q]]}{(det(aa+bb)=p , det(ca+db)=q)}\\ ] ] .    for @xmath32 , namely for @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the quantum sheaf cohomology above , recover the `` classical '' quantum cohomology of the quadric , as it is expected .      as one",
    "can see from this section , the first ingredient for the construction of a quantum sheaf cohomology is an omalous bundle .",
    "however , despite their importance , only few examples are known in the literature .",
    "a first class of examples consists of deformations of the tangent bundle @xmath54 which are omalous by trivial reasons . on the other hand , as showed by andreas and garcia - fernandez in 2010 , the stability of an omalous bundle is a very important property , because such a bundle provide a solution of the so - called strominger system in super - string theory . in this direction , a first systematic attempt to construct stable omalous bundles was done in 2011 by henni and jardim in @xcite .",
    "they uses monads to construct : + - stable omalous rank @xmath59 bundles on @xmath59-folds in @xmath60 , + - stable omalous rank @xmath61 bundles on c.i .",
    "cy s in projective spaces , + - omalous of rank @xmath62 bundles on multi - blowup of the plane , + - stable omalous of various ranks on the segre variety .",
    "also , in @xcite , was studied omalous rank @xmath61-bundles on hirzebruch surfaces .",
    "the next section will be devoted to the construction of stable omalous bundles on surfaces , with special emphasis for the case where @xmath4 is a surface of general type .",
    "i shall first describe a general construction for stable bundles due to li and qin @xcite .",
    "after that i shall consider certain concrete cases where this construction can be applied to produces stable omalous bundles .",
    "in what follows @xmath4 is a smooth projective surface and @xmath63 a very ample polarization .",
    "the @xmath63-stability of a sheaf @xmath29 means that it has the greatest fraction @xmath64 among all its sub - sheaves .",
    "the main problem for the moment is the following : fixing the rank @xmath65 and the first chern class @xmath66 , to find a computable bound @xmath67 depending only on @xmath65 , @xmath63 and @xmath66 such that for any @xmath68 there is an @xmath63-stable vector bundle of rank @xmath65 with the given chern classes @xmath66 and @xmath69 . the main result of li and qin asserts that for @xmath67 one can take the following value : @xmath70+\\ ] ] @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the canonical class and @xmath73 the geometric genus of @xmath4 .",
    "the main point in the proof of li - qin theorem is the following generalization of the usual cayley - bacharach property cf .",
    "@xcite :    consider @xmath74 line bundles @xmath75 and @xmath76-cycles + @xmath77 on @xmath4 ; let @xmath78 .",
    "then , there is a locally free extension in @xmath79 iff for any @xmath80 , @xmath81 satisfies the cayley - bacharach property with respect to the linear system @xmath82 .",
    "after that , the desired bundle @xmath29 is constructed as an extension @xmath83 for a convenient choice of @xmath74 reduced @xmath76-cycles @xmath84 that ensures the stability of @xmath29 .",
    "a similar construction in rank @xmath61 appeared in @xcite , @xcite and was used in @xcite to construct large families of bundles in connection with the strong bogomolov inequality .",
    "as a conclusion with respect to the li - qin construction we can state the following :    the value of @xmath67 grows up with the chern number @xmath85 due to the presence of the @xmath86-term and to riemann - roch .",
    "therefore , if their construction can produce omalous bundles , it is better to try on surfaces that satisfy at least @xmath87 the above inequality , combined with bogomolov - miyaoka - yau inequality @xmath88 for surfaces of general type , suggests to look at certain convenient such surfaces .      viewing the above considerations",
    ", we can introduce the following :    a surface of general type is `` good of type @xmath89 '' if for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , there exists @xmath92 and a very ample line bundle @xmath63 , such that @xmath93 where @xmath67 is the li - qin constant introduced before .    in terms of the above definition ,",
    "the li - qin existence theorem has the following obvious consequence :    on a general type surface @xmath4 `` good of type @xmath89 '' , there exists @xmath63-stable omalous vector bundles of rank @xmath65 .",
    "this last part is devoted to the illustration of the above results on a concrete class of examples : @xmath94 a smooth surface of degree @xmath95 in @xmath2 .",
    "well known computations gives for @xmath94 the following values of invariants : @xmath96 also , by noether formula , @xmath97 so , the leading therm in @xmath95 which appear in the li - qin constant @xmath67 is @xmath98 as consequence , for @xmath99 and @xmath100 we have @xmath101 .",
    "so , on can apply the li - qin construction , obtaining the following :    there is an explicitly computable constant @xmath102 , such that for all @xmath103 and all @xmath99 , on any smooth surface @xmath104 of degree @xmath95 there exists a stable omalous bundle of rank @xmath65 .",
    "as further directions , an open question asked by donagi et al . in @xcite concern the computation of the quantum sheaf cohomology for other sheafs than the tangent bundle . of course , the above constructed stable omalous bundles are good candidates for such a computation .",
    "moreover , due to the range of their ranks , less than @xmath105 , this question is very interesting viewing the following conjecture from @xcite :        c. anghel , _ une construction de fibrs vectoriels stables de rang deux avec @xmath108 suffisament grand sur une surface algbrique _ , c. r. acad .",
