    "we have found that the solar mixing angle can only be increased with respect to the hps reference value . under the assumption that all neutrino masses have the same @xmath58-sign ,",

    "in contrast , in the case of opposite cp signs there is no bound on the lightest neutrino mass .",
    "we have also shown that the atmospheric and reactor mixing angles remain essentially stable in all cases .",
    "it should not be surprising that the effect of radiative corrections is more important for the solar angle than for the others .",
    "it simply reflects the fact that the solar is the smallest of the two neutrino mass splittings .",
    "we stress that in our approach we have assumed only that the matrix @xmath1 is diagonalized by the hps matrix at the unification scale and this gets modified only by minimal supergravity radiative corrections , universal and flavor - blind at unification .",

    "their magnitude will be determined by the strength of the yukawa coupling characterizing the dirac neutrino mass entry in the seesaw mass matrix  @xcite .",
    "this will depend strongly on the details of the model , in particular , on whether higgs triplets are present in the seesaw  @xcite or on whether the seesaw is extended  @xcite .",
    "scrutinizing the schemes for which it is possible to decrease the solar mixing angle value predicted by the hps mixing pattern towards its currently preferred best fit point value will be considered elsewhere  @xcite , together with the related issue of the lepton flavor violating processes that would be expected in these schemes .",
