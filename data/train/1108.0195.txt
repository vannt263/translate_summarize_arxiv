    "as a result of symmetry breaking phase transitions during the evolution of the early universe various topological defects could arise @xcite .",
    "in particular , cosmic strings have been of increasing interest due to the importance that they may have in cosmology . though the recent observational data on the cosmic microwave background radiation have ruled out cosmic strings as the primary source for primordial density perturbations , they are still candidates for the generation of a number of interesting physical effects such as the generation of gravitational waves , high - energy cosmic rays , and gamma ray bursts .",
    "more recently it has been shown that cosmic stings form in brane inflation models as a by product of the annihilation of the branes ( for a review see @xcite ) .    in the simplest theoretical model the spacetime of a cosmic string",

    "the distortion of the vacuum fluctuations spectrum by the cosmic string also gives rise to casimir - polder forces acting on a polarizable microparticle .",
    "nowadays , these forces have attracted a great deal of attention because of their important role in many areas of science @xcite . with advances in nanotechnology and successes in the production of ultracold atoms it became possible to measure the both casimir and casimir - polder forces with increased precision ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , related to possible applications for micro and nano electro - mechanical systems , the search for geometries that would lead to repulsive casimir - polder forces is under active research ( see , for instance , discussion in @xcite and references therein ) . in ref .",
