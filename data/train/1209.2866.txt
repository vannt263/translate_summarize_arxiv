    "interplanetary coronal mass ejections ( icmes ) are massive expulsions of plasma and magnetic flux from the solar corona into interplanetary space and are thought to form enormous bent tubes , with radial scale sizes of tenths of an au , when they are observed in situ by spacecraft in the solar wind . with few exceptions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the same is true for shock waves in the solar wind that are often driven by the magnetic structure inside the icme ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where it is in general also unclear how to extrapolate , if possible at all , the global shock shape and structure from parameters obtained only at a single point in space .",

    "* ) , but it is often unclear if the principal direction of the icme at 1 au is east or west of the observer and how the shock surface and the flux rope `` tube '' look on a global scale , which is needed for forecasting the arrival time with geometrical models approximating these shapes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "( _ sdo _ , launched in early 2010 ) , a new era has begun where in situ multi - point observations of icmes have become available in connection with high - resolution imaging of the solar corona and multi - point imaging of the entire sun - earth line .",
    "historically , because of a lack of systematic measurements , there have been very few in situ observations of icmes at large longitudinal or in - ecliptic separations , and those found were serendipitous ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the _ stereo _ mission , consisting of two spacecraft increasingly leading and lagging the earth at a rate of 22@xmath0  per year , has made some observations of magnetic flux ropes ( mfrs ; intervals with smoothly rotating magnetic field ) inside icmes at up to three points in space ( including _ wind _ or _ ace _ near earth ) , and it was found that the observations often differed greatly , even for small longitudinal separation of a few degrees ( see the extensive summary of these recent and historic events by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this might be expected for mfrs that have a high inclination of their axis to the ecliptic plane , because one spacecraft passes through the center of the flux rope and the other one crosses along its edge @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that it is also possible for a high inclination flux rope to have a strongly elongated cross - section .    for flux ropes with a low inclination to the ecliptic",
    ", one can probe the distribution of the magnetic field along the tube , and significant differences of the axial orientations and magnetic fluxes have been found at a spacecraft separation of 20 - 40@xmath0  @xcite , presumably caused by the interaction with a high - speed stream . @xcite",
    "summarized the available multi - point observations of icmes by noting that `` the characteristics of icmes and the structure of the solar wind they are embedded in varied significantly from event to event '' .",
    "thus , the common picture of flux ropes inside icmes as magnetic loops extending from the sun into interplanetary space likely needs to be revised to include distortions of the axis and the cross - section .",
    "in fact , the magnetic field geometry itself is also uncertain ; while it is generally thought to consist of helical field lines , other configurations can lead to similar appearances of the magnetic field in situ @xcite , so this matter is also open to further inquiry .    throughout this paper , we stick to definitions given by @xcite .",
    "we define an `` icme '' as the full interval of solar wind signatures which has changed as compared to the background wind due to the presence of the eruption .",
    "this includes the shock , the sheath region of piled - up and compressed plasma behind the shock and the magnetic ejecta , often driving the shock at 1  au .",
    "subclasses of ejecta are mfrs , which are defined by an interval of smoothly rotating magnetic field in combination with enhanced total field strength .",
    "if the interval additionally fulfills low proton temperature they are called `` magnetic clouds '' .",
    "@xcite also defined `` magnetic cloud like '' ( mcl ) structures which have the general characteristics of mcs , but their field rotation is not clear enough to put them into one of the eight categories for mcs defined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have found a case where the mcl signature was definitely caused by the spacecraft crossing a leg of an icme seen in heliospheric images , as assumed by @xcite .",
    "all the above ideas are made even more complicated by the fact that coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) often tend to erupt in rather quick succession , a feature which was originally observed for flares and thus called `` sympathetic '' flaring ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such a case , one eruption is causally related to the other . in the interplanetary medium ,",
    "given these favorable initial conditions , icmes might run into one another and interact .",
    "especially around solar maximum , with the next one expected for 2013 , this could be a rather common situation ( e.g. , recent periods of strong successive activity include 2011 february and 2012 march ) .",
    "if as a result of the merging process the identification of the individual icmes is impossible , the structure is called a `` complex ejecta '' @xcite .",
    "however , it may also happen that coalescing events retain their individual structure , but the mutual interaction involving energy and momentum transfer between the icmes may alter their field and plasma structure in distinct ways ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in general , solar wind streams which show two speed maxima ( either cme  cir or cme  cme ) are also called `` compound streams '' and they are associated frequently with large geomagnetic storms @xcite .",
    "thus , these streams are of great interest to space weather research in general , simply because the disturbed solar wind interval is both longer and compression may lead to enhanced and more geo - effective southward pointing magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a series of cmes took place on 2010 august 1 , associated with several flares , filament eruptions , and coronal dimmings , and was one of the first periods of strong activity in the rising phase of the current solar cycle 24 . in a very fortunate way",
    ", many spacecraft equipped with suitable instruments and far separated in heliolongitude were positioned at different heliospheric distances to study this event chain from sun to earth with both imaging and in situ observations . to get the most out of this unprecedented dataset , an international team has formed to discuss the events at workshops in abingdon ( uk ) , graz ( austria ) and aberystwyth ( uk ) , all held in the first half of 2011 .",

    "our paper is meant to close the circle , and to analyze all the available in situ observations in detail , as part of the most complete data set on a sequence of solar eruptions we are aware of , observed from the sun end  to  end to 1  au .",

    "venus express ( vex ) _ , in a polar orbit around venus at the time of the event , was situated between _ stereo - behind _ and the earth , and the _ messenger _ probe was located between _ stereo - ahead _ and the earth .",

    "it is tempting to think that the shocks _",
    "s1 _ and _ s2 _ in figure  [ fig : all](b ) are signatures of two different , extended shock fronts . by this",
    "we mean that there actually exist only two large - scale fronts , which the spacecraft sample at different points in space and time .",
    "we can justify this by estimating the arrival times of the shocks if the spacecraft were all positioned at the same heliocentric distance , in our case the heliocentric distance of the _ wind _ spacecraft ( @xmath13=1.006  au ) , which we further use as a reference point .    to this end , we plot the extrapolated arrival times at @xmath13 of both shocks as red vertical dashed lines in figure  [ fig : all](b ) , by using constant speeds of @xmath14  km  s@xmath15 for _ s1 _ , and @xmath16  km  s@xmath15 for _ s2 _ at _ stereo - b _ , which are the shock normal speeds at _ stereo - b _ ( derived in section 3 ) . for _",
    "vex _ there is no high resolution plasma data available , so we assume this speed is @xmath17 km  s@xmath15 , a mean value between the results for _ wind _ and _ stereo - b_. while the initial speed of the most eastward cme2 is @xmath18  km  s@xmath15 , @xcite showed that there was a strong deceleration due to interaction with cme1 around 3050 @xmath19 , and that cme2 attained a constant speed well before the heliocentric distance of venus .",
    "it is also not expected that the icme speed changes much between 0.72  au and 1  au @xcite .",
    "thus , assuming this speed to be constant from the venus distance to about 1  au and beyond is reasonable .",
    "for _ messenger _ we use @xmath20  km  s@xmath15 , similar to the value observed for _",
    "wind_. again , for _ messenger _",
    "there is no high - time resolution plasma data .",
    "if we assume some deceleration up to 1  au , this choice is consistent with the @xmath21  600 km  s@xmath15 initial speeds for both cmes heading to the west of earth ( cme3/4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and similar propagation speeds for these cmes derived from _ stereo / hi _ observations by @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the shock surface moves radially away from the sun .",
    "figure  [ fig : all](b ) shows a clear progression from east to west for the time - shifted arrivals ( see the red dashed lines ) : _ s2 _ arrived first at _ stereo - b _ , then at _ vex _ , followed by _ wind _ ( all three within 12 hr ) , and last at _ messenger _ , and it is undetected by _ stereo - a_. the extrapolated arrival times at _ stereo - b _ ( vertical red dashed lines ) in figure  [ fig : all ] are earlier than the observed ones because _ stereo - b _ is at a larger heliocentric distance than _ wind_. the close timing compels us to believe that we are observing the same shock surface at the different locations , and the late _ messenger _ observations and the lower shock normal speed at _ wind _ are expected because for a convex surface , such as an expanding circular front attached to the sun , the side parts ( or `` flank '' ) will move slower than the front part ( also called  apex  or  nose  of the icme",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we thus deduce qualitatively that the shock surface for _ s2 _ has a convex shape , with a smaller radial distance of the shock front correlated with positive longitude values for a given point in time .",
    "this means that the shock front is in this case not spherical with respect to the sun .",
    "there are two effects which we think contribute to this shape .",
    "first , the previous icme on july 30 , which is associated with shock _ s1 _ @xcite , created a region of depleted density in the solar wind , so the eastern part of the icmes originating on august 1 experienced less drag , which led to less deceleration .",
    "secondly , one has to keep in mind that the initial speed of cme2 , with an initial direction between e25 and e41 , was @xmath18  km  s@xmath15 and thus about double than for the other cmes ( all @xmath22  km  s@xmath15 ) .",
    "the shock _",
    "s1 _ is constrained to the east of earth and is observed first at _ stereo - b _ ,",
    "then at _ vex _ , but neither at _ wind _ nor _ messenger _",
    "so we can not derive an approximate global shape like for _ s2_.      we have also deduced the shape of the shock front in a more quantitative way . in many situations ,",
    "this shape is unknown or accessible only through numerical simulations .",
    "however , this shape is of great interest for predicting the arrival time of icmes as a function of heliospheric longitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and we are especially interested in its appearance for a complex situation involving interacting icmes .    in figure  [",
    "fig : global_shock](a ) we plotted the estimated heliocentric distance of the shock ( e.g. , @xmath23 for the shock _ s2 _ at _ stereo - b _ ) along radials from the sun to each spacecraft for the time the shock is observed at _ wind _ ( @xmath24 = 2010 august 3 17:05 ut ) using @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being the _ s2 _ shock normal speed and its arrival time , respectively at _ stereo - b_. again , we assume radial propagation of the shock .",
    "the result is @xmath28  au , which is considerably larger than @xmath29  au .",
    "both distances would be similar if the shock had the shape of a sphere centered on the sun .",
    "similarly , estimating these distances for _ vex _ and _ messenger _ by using similar speeds as for the time - shifts ( 550 km  s@xmath15 for _ vex _ and 500 km  s@xmath15 for _ messenger _ ) , we get @xmath30  au and @xmath31  au . we may thus plot the shock front _ s2 _ as the red solid line connecting the dots ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the snapshot of the shock arrival time at _ wind _ in figure  [ fig : global_shock](a ) , showing clearly the non - spherical shape . between _ vex _ and _ wind _ as well as _ wind _ and _ messenger",

    "a similar analysis was done for shock _ s1 _ , which seems to have a shape closer to spherical than _ s2 _ , but with only two data points it is difficult to discuss the global structure of _",
    "so we will further concentrate on _",
    "s2_.    as we will discuss in a later section , we note that if _ s2 _ is indeed one large shock surface spanning @xmath32@xmath0  in heliolongitude , it likely is driven by different structures at different locations along the front .      additionally , to fully characterize the observed complex flows in a simple fashion",
    ", we can deduce how the maximum observed magnetic field strength scales with heliospheric longitude , and again , we need to roughly compensate for the different heliospheric distances @xmath33 of the spacecraft . as a proxy",
    ", we use an empirical scaling relation for the inner heliosphere by @xcite , who found that the maximum magnetic field strength @xmath34 inside mcs in the inner heliosphere ( @xmath35  au ) depends on radial distance as @xmath36 with @xmath34 in ( nt ) and @xmath33 in ( au ) .",
    "for example , the peak field strength was observed by _",
    "vex _ at the front of the flux rope _ m2 _ as @xmath37  nt at a radial distance of @xmath38 . to estimate",
    "the maximum @xmath39 scaled to the radial distance of @xmath13 , we simply eliminate the factor @xmath40 to obtain @xmath41 yielding @xmath42  nt . at _ stereo - b _ and _ messenger _ , the peak field ( see table  [ tab : positions ] ) is also detected shortly after _",
    "s2 _ , while it is more delayed to _",
    "s2 _ at _ wind _ , our reference location . taken together ,",
    "the maximum field strengths estimated at @xmath13 compare as : 36.2  nt ( _ stereo - b _ ) , 34.4  nt ( _ vex _ ) , 19.2  nt ( _ wind _ , not scaled ) , and 6.8  nt ( _ messenger _ ) . for comparison ,",
    "the result is 9.4  nt for _ stereo - a _ , which did not observe the structure .",
    "thus , the high peak field at _ messenger _ is scaled down to normal solar wind levels at 1  au .",
    "this also means that the shock , if it had an initial component towards _ stereo - a _ , is likely to have decayed when it reached 1  au at its western edge .    because one gets easily lost in these huge amounts of data",
    ", it is useful to keep the basic picture which emerged from this section in mind as a background for the following , more detailed analysis .",
    "we now move on to calculate parameters of the shocks and flux ropes to obtain an even more detailed global picture using the in situ observations .",

    "we now discuss the individual shock parameters , summarized in table  [ tab : shocks ] , in view of the question : may we extrapolate features of the shock surface from a local to the global scale ?",
    "it was found in previous studies that even on a length scale of only a few @xmath92 , shock normals can be inconsistent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pointing to non - planarity or corrugation of the shock surface on very small scales compared to the global extent .",
    "we can observe the shock _",
    "s2 _ at a longitudinal spacecraft separation of 120@xmath0 , which corresponds to a length of @xmath116  au at the heliocentric distance of 1  au ( neglecting the non - spherical shape of the shock )",
    ". the maximum separation of near - earth spacecraft is of the order of a few hundred @xmath92 , which is roughly a factor 100 less than @xmath117 .",
    "it thus becomes clear that for a corrugated shock surface on scales much less than @xmath117 , it would be impossible to extrapolate the global shape of the shock from a single - spacecraft observation .",
    "however , @xcite also note that fast ejecta impose a more pronounced planarity to the shocks which they are driving as compared to slower ones .",
    "a prime example for such a `` well - behaving '' shock near earth driven by a fast ejecta is discussed by @xcite . it may thus be expected that , for a fast compound stream like the structures following _ s2 _ , with speeds up to 800  km  s@xmath15 at _ stereo - b _ and 600  km  s@xmath15 at _ wind _ , it could indeed be possible to extrapolate the principal direction of the shock front from the single - point shock normals and see if it is consistent with the `` real '' situation as determined by the multi - spacecraft observations .    to this end , we may take a look again at figure  [ fig : global_shock](a ) .",
    "in particular , note the longitude of the shock normals , which flare away from the radial direction , towards the east at _ stereo - b _ , slightly west at _ vex _ and more pronounced to the west at _",
    "wind_. this is intuitively expected for a non - corrugated shock surface which is convex with respect to the sun .",
    "only _ messenger _ does not follow this pattern , which could be a hint that the shock surface at the outer flank is not driven strongly enough .",
    "an observer looking at near - earth spacecraft would thus have correctly deduced , by looking at the longitude of the shock normal , that the apex of this shock is to the east of earth .",
    "this means that the principal direction of the shock can be correctly obtained in this case from single - point ( using co - planarity ) or multi - point ( the four - spacecraft time - of - flight method ) shock analysis of a shock driven by a fast ejecta in near - earth space .    the configuration of the shock _",
    "s2 _ seems to be altered by the presence of the previous icme at the location of _ stereo - b _ , where the shock strength is lower , due to the higher field strength and lower density @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the strength of the shock is moderately strong for the full extent . the shock _",
    "s2 _ is also everywhere oblique except at _ stereo - b _ , where it is quasi - perpendicular , which is consistent with expectations . in general , shocks are more likely to be quasi - perpendicular while propagating inside an icme @xcite . at _ wind _ and _ vex _ , the shock has just reached the back of a previous ejecta and seems not yet strongly altered in its configuration . from both methods we used in near - earth space , the angle @xmath47 is still close to 45@xmath0 , as expected for a spherical shock propagating through a nominal parker spiral field ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : global_shock](a ) ) .",
    "in contrast to the shock normal , the shock configuration is a function of the upstream field , which complicates the situation .",
    "nevertheless , for this event it looks like the configuration of the shock as a function of longitude behaves as it is expected from our general understanding of interplanetary shocks .    in summary , the global shape of the shock _",
    "s2 _ is clearly non - spherical , though convex with respect to the sun as expected , and the longitude of the shock normals @xmath43 , follow a pattern consistent with this shape at three out four locations .",
    "the following relation is valid : if the longitude of @xmath43 points east ( west ) of the radial direction , the shock apex is to the west ( east ) of the spacecraft . only at the most western location at _ messenger _ , which represents its flank , the opposite is seen .",
    "this also places the apex of the shock between _ stereo - b _ and _ vex_. the configuration of the shock as a function of heliospheric longitude is complicated by the presence of previous icmes , but follows a pattern expected for observations at 1 au .",
    "in this section we use different modeling techniques to extract more information on the observed large - scale magnetic flux ropes ( mfrs ) , i.e. , those parts of the icme intervals which exhibit a smoothly rotating field over a large angle , in addition to higher - than - average magnetic field .",
    "these are the structures we have defined as _",
    "m1/2/3 _ at the spacecraft _ stereo - b _ , _ vex _ and _ wind _ , and _ m1 _ at _ messenger_. our intention is to find matches between the model results to find out if the structures observed at a single spacecraft may be connected to each other and how the resulting global structures may look like .",
    "we use the same conventions for coordinate systems and orientation angles as for the shocks in the previous section .",
    "an inspection of figure  [ fig : wind ] , showing the magnetic field components in gse coordinates and proton bulk parameters , indicates that one mfr ( labelled m1 ) may be identified before the arrival of shock _",
    "s2 _ , and two distinct mfrs can identified at _ wind _ after the shock _",
    "s2 _ and its following sheath structure , which is the region of `` shocked '' solar wind with high temperature , density and proton @xmath118 .",
    "m2 _ and _ m3 _ are immersed in a declining flow speed ( @xmath119 ) profile with two maxima which is typical for complex ejecta @xcite , and it also satisfies the definition of a compound stream .",
    "thus , it is immediately clear that this flow is composed of several structures , and , as was shown in @xcite , these structures can still be treated as individual entities , also at the other spacecraft .",
    "thus this stream is not classified as a `` complex ejecta '' in the sense of @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that structure _ m1 _ , whose back part seems to be `` caught '' by the shock just before arrival at 1  au , could be the flank of a cme originating on the sun on july 30 , so all icme signatures except the proton temperature are not well pronounced , and thus we will not discuss this structure further here .",
    "the region _ m2",
    "_ started on august 4 04:34 ut and it extended almost seamlessly until the front boundary of _ m3",
    "_ arrived on august 4 10:07 ut , and _",
    "m3 _ extended further to august 4 23:18 ut . both mfrs were associated with a low variance magnetic field and a smooth rotation of the magnetic field direction , and the proton temperature in _ m3 _ is clearly low enough to classify this structure as a magnetic cloud @xcite .",
    "also , @xmath118 showed a clear depression and the solar wind speed had a declining profile , the latter indicative of ongoing radial expansion when it passed _",
    "wind_. these are typical signatures of mcs at 1  au , though its size of @xmath120  au is not particularly large ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the structure _ m2 _ shows stronger maximum fields ( 19.4  nt compared to 14.1  nt for _ m3 _ ) , higher proton temperatures , an enhancement in density denoted by _ d1 _ , a smaller size ( @xmath121  au ) and no radial expansion , which are all indicators of interaction with _ m3 _ after @xcite .",
    "it could also be that the shock _ s2 _ passed through _",
    "m2 _ before 1  au , and led to additional compression and heating , which is consistent with what is seen in heliospheric images @xcite . at the leading edge of _",
    ", there is another density increase ( _ d2 _ ) , which is stronger and of shorter duration",
    ". we do not think that it is the cause of compression , but rather that it is possible filament material .",
    "we plan to discuss this observation in detail in a subsequent publication .",
    "more specifically , the average speed of the expansion is defined as a half of the difference between the speeds at the leading and trailing edges of the icme . for _ m3 _",
    ", the measured speeds were 585  km  s@xmath15 and 504  km  s@xmath15 , respectively , yielding an expansion speed of 41 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "this is @xmath122  km  s@xmath15 less than typical for events observed at 1  au @xcite . on the contrary , _",
    "m2 _ was associated with a positive speed gradient of 8 km  s@xmath15 from the trailing to leading boundary , thus it was even contracting slightly as it passed 1  au , which could also explain its smaller size .    to estimate the local mc axis orientations and other parameters we used the method of grad - shafranov ( gs ) reconstruction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this method assumes time - independence and invariance along one direction which is equated with the axis of the mc . the first assumption is approximately fulfilled for _",
    "m2 _ as shown above and also for _ m3 _ since the radial expansion is in the order of 10@xmath123 of the average speed for",
    "_ m3_. by numerical integration , a map of the mc magnetic field lines in a plane perpendicular to the axis can be created without assuming a particular shape for the cross - section .",
    "the technique could be successfully applied to both mfr intervals .",
    "the resultant plots are shown in figure  [ fig : wind_gs ] and the calculated values are again summarized in table [ tab : flux ] .    figures  [ fig : wind_gs](a ) and ( b ) show the transverse pressure @xmath124 as a function of the vector potential @xmath125 for each flux rope .",
    "note that the plasma pressure is calculated from the protons only . for the assumed symmetry",
    ", the vector potential may be expressed in the form @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the axis direction and @xmath128 is then expressed as @xmath129 .",
    "the local mc axis orientation is found by constraining @xmath130 to be a single - valued function of @xmath131 , i.e. , having the same values along the in- and outgoing paths . to see how well this function",
    "can be fitted with a polynomial ( of order 2 , black solid line ) with exponential tails ( black dashed lines ) which is used for the numerical integration , a fitting residue @xmath132 is defined @xcite . for _",
    "m2 _ , the value of @xmath133 indicates a very good fit . for _ m3 _ , this function has to be quite strongly extrapolated , and the fitting residue ( @xmath134 ) is relatively high , which indicates that the method is not working well and that the magnetic field map and the results in table  [ tab : flux ] for this structure should be taken with care .",
    "this is also clear from looking at the magnetic field components , where it is not straightforward to discern a clear full rotation of the field .",

    "however , at both spacecraft there is no sheath region , so the rope follows the shock immediately , and thus we think it is much more likely that this is just the shocked part of the _ m1 _ structure and not a separate icme .",
    "the scenario of the shock _",
    "s2 _ reaching the back of the cme on july 30 ( connected to the structures _",
    "s1/m1 _ ) just before 1 au is also consistent with heliospheric imaging @xcite .    at _ messenger _",
    ", we could identify only one short interval where the field is relatively smooth and rotating .",
    "this follows the shock _",
    "s2 _ and is an nws rope , with the axis being close to the ecliptic plane and the axial field pointing in the @xmath147 ( rtn coordinates ) or solar west direction .      in figure",

    "figure  [ fig : global_flux](c ) shows the viewpoint looking from the radial going through earth toward the sun .",
    "the orientations are visualized by cylinders with sizes derived from modeling as taken from table  [ tab : flux ] . however , in a manner similar to the correction we imposed for the shock surface , we tried to reproduce the sizes and positions of the mfr at one `` snapshot '' reference point in time , for which we deliberately choose the _ s2 _ shock arrival time at the _ wind _ spacecraft ( @xmath24 ) . to this end , we moved the flux rope centers according to equation  ( 1 ) , but now using the average speeds of the flux ropes ( see table  [ tab : flux ] , column 5 ) to correct for the different arrival times at different heliocentric distances .",
    "as an example , the flux rope center arrives at _ vex _ on august 3 01:30 ut , which is 15h35min ahead of the shock arrival time at _ wind_. during this time , the _ m3 _",
    "center moves 0.206 au further away from the sun ( assuming a uniform speed of 550 km  s@xmath15 for _ m3 _ ) , and at the time @xmath24 it is positioned at @xmath148=0.933 au , and this is the distance at which we place this mfr in figure  [ fig : global_flux ] . for _ stereo - b _ , the position of _ m3 _ in figure  [ fig : global_flux ] ( @xmath149  au ) is _ less _ than @xmath150 , because the center of the flux rope arrives later ( august 4 02:26 ut ) than the reference time @xmath24 . in summary , at our reference time , the flux rope _ m3 _ had an almost identical heliocentric distance along the radials going from the sun through the positions of _ stereo - b _ and _",
    "vex_.    we also expanded ( or contracted ) the mfr size from the time of the observation of the mfr center at the spacecraft to the reference time , for all spacecraft except _",
    "wind_. similar to the estimate for the maximum magnetic field strength of the icme flows at 1 au as function of heliospheric longitude ( see equation  ( [ mylaw ] ) and table  1 ) , we employ a similar correction for the ongoing expansion of the mfrs .",
    "the average expansion of mcs in the inner heliosphere , which we again use as a rough proxy , was quoted by @xcite as @xmath151 with @xmath141 and @xmath33 in ( au )",
    ". a similar approach as in section 2.3 leads to @xmath152 this formula tells us the size to which an average mc would expand at any heliocentric distance @xmath153 if the diameter @xmath154 of the mc is observed at a heliocentric distance @xmath155 . as an example , for the application to _ vex _ we use for @xmath153 the estimated position of the flux rope center ( @xmath148 ) from above and an estimated flux rope diameter at @xmath38 of @xmath156  au ( again assuming the mfr has a uniform speed of 550 km  s@xmath15 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ mylawsize ] ) then leads to a diameter @xmath157  au , which we use for the size of the pink cylinder at _ vex _ in figure  [ fig : global_flux ] .",
    "the result for _ stereo - b _ is a contraction from 0.120  au to 0.106  au , which again follows from the fact that the center of _ m3 _ hits _ stereo - b _ _ _ later _ _ than @xmath24 .      in summary ,",
    "figure  [ fig : global_flux ] should be seen as the final result of our flux rope analysis .",
    "we note several interesting hints on the global flux rope configuration , following from this figure .",
    "we indicated the mfrs which seem to belong to the same large structure with similar colors : pink for _ m3 _ at _ stereo - b _ and _ vex _ , blue for _ m2 _ at _ wind _ , and red for _ wind _ _ _ m3 _ _ and _ messenger _ _ _ m1__. these associations follow quite naturally by looking at the chirality of the field and the axial field directions .",
    "in particular , _ m3 _ for _ stereo - b _ and _ vex _ can not extend to earth because of the different axial field direction , which is eastward for the eastern ( pink ) structure and westward for the western ( red ) structure . also , the field chirality is the opposite , so we think that these associations are solid .",
    "further , it could be that _",
    "m1 _ at _ messenger",
    "_ belongs to the same structure as _ m3 _ at earth , because the axial field directions and chirality ( left handed ) are similar .",
    "however , these observations are very separated , in both space ( 0.6 au radial distance , 49@xmath0  heliospheric longitude ) and time ( about two days ) .",
    "while the separation in longitude is less than an often quoted limit of 60@xmath0  for the flux rope extent in heliospheric longitude @xcite , @xcite did not find connections between the two structures from smei density reconstructions .",
    "all this makes it difficult to tell if these observations sample the same flux rope or not .    by looking at the longitude of the axes ,",
    "best viewed in figure  [ fig : global_flux](a ) , it seems that imagining the flux rope as a bent tube on a large scale works relatively well for these events .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : global_flux](c ) shows that the latitude of the axes for the pink and red tubes are quite inconsistent with each other  cautioning that the red tube might be a different structure .",
    "this might be a hint that an inclination of a flux rope should rather be viewed as a local parameter .",
    "it is , however , difficult to distinguish true axial distortions or a `` warped '' shape on a large scale from a possible failure of the methods we used for finding the axial orientation in the first place",

    ", 2012 , solar physics , in revision ) .",
    "however , @xcite show fits of non - linear force - free models @xcite to these mfrs and they are quite consistent with the results presented here . because different models give us quite similar answers here , we think that the picture presented in figure  [ fig : global_flux ] is a relatively robust one .      in figure  [",
    "fig : associate ] we try to relate the observed multi - point flux rope structures to the measured cmes in coronagraphs .",
    "similar to figure  [ fig : all](a ) , orange arrows indicate initial directions for the four cmes on 2010 august 1 as given by an elliptical forward modeling technique applied to both",
    "_ stereo_/cor2 coronagraphs @xcite .",
    "we think these results represent well the conclusions of other papers to determine the directions of these cmes .",
    "for example , @xcite found a range for the direction for cme2 from e6 to e41 , and @xcite find e25 for cme2 .",
    "@xcite , discussing the propagation phase in _",
    "stereo_/hi for cme2 ( in their paper called cme l ) , find a direction between e0 and e40 , which is also consistent with e25 . by using green ellipses , we group flux rope observations which likely can be traced back to a similar cme .",
    "first , it is quite straightforward to associate the _ m3 _ structure at _ stereo - b _ and _ vex _ ( pink tubes in figures  [ fig : global_flux ] and  [ fig : associate ] ) with the fast cme2 , mainly because cme2 was the one with the most eastward initial direction .",
    "it also had a significant northward direction of @xmath21  n20 @xcite , which should have contributed to a glancing encounter for these spacecraft , resulting in the rather unpronounced magnetic field rotation at _ stereo - b _ and _ vex_. note that @xcite do not find a connection between these two structures from smei density reconstructions , but it follows from the magnetic field modeling that they should belong to the same large - scale structure .",
    "it is intriguing that _ m3 _ was seen at _ stereo - b _ and _ vex _ located 46@xmath0  and 28@xmath0  to the east of the most likely initial direction for the cme2 , respectively . given the 60@xmath0  limit for widths of mcs @xcite noted earlier , one would expect _ vex _ to encounter the edge of cme2 and that it misses _ stereo - b _ completely .",
    "this flux rope is not observed at earth , though it is 25@xmath0  west of the cme2 initial direction , which is closer than _ vex_. explanations for this could be that cme2 propagated more easily eastward into the depleted density region by the 2010 july 30 cme , or that the interaction with cme1 around 3050  @xmath19 @xcite may have led to a deflection to the east for cme2 and to the west for cme1 ( see also lugaz et al .",
    "2012 , apj , in press , reaching similar conclusions for a different event ) .    indeed , at earth ,",
    "flux rope ( blue ) , which does not have a counterpart elsewhere , might correspond to cme1 , which had an initial direction also slightly to the east , but closer to earth ( see again figure  [ fig : associate ] ) . furthermore , if the strong density peak _ d2 _ at the front boundary of _",
    "m3 _ is indeed filament material , then _",
    "m3 _ ( the red tube ) would correspond to cme3 , which was almost co - temporal with cme2 @xcite and associated with a filament eruption around disk center in the northern hemisphere @xcite . as discussed in the previous section , while it makes sense to associate the only clean flux rope observed at _ messenger _ with _",
    "m3 _ at _ wind _ , the observations are too far separated in space and time to make a definitive connection .",
    "the weak cme4 did not seem to leave any strong trace in the in situ data , or , alternatively , could be responsible for the _ messenger _ _ m1 _ flux rope .    in summary , for three out of four cmes we could find reasonable connections to mfrs",
    "observed in situ . for at least one cme ,",
    "a deflection during heliospheric propagation seems to be needed to explain the connection between the observations in coronagraphs and in situ .",
    "we have avoided associating the shocks with specific cmes , because , for an extended shock surface like _ s2 _ spanning @xmath32@xmath0  in heliolongitude , different cmes may drive it at different frontal locations .",
    "in this last section of the paper , we will take a closer look on this compound stream as observed near earth , to find out which parts of it were responsible for producing geomagnetic activity .",
    "figure [ fig : geoeffects ] plots from top to bottom ( a ) the clock angle of the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) , i.e. , the polar angle in the gsm @xmath158 plane , ( b ) the _ dst _ index at 1 hr temporal resolution , and ( c ) the _ kp _ index at 3 hr resolution , obtained from the world data center for geomagnetism in kyoto . the polar angle is defined as 0@xmath0  for a purely northward pointing imf , 90@xmath0  for an eastward oriented , and 180@xmath0  for a purely southward pointing field .",
    "the 1-hr _ dst _ index is calculated from four low - latitude magnetogram stations and it monitors the strength of the symmetric equatorial ring current . in figure",
    "[ fig : geoeffects](b ) we have also plotted the pressure - corrected _ dst _ index ( _ dst _ * ) where the effect of the magnetopause chapman - ferraro currents is removed according to @xcite .",
    "this correction assumes a chapman - ferraro scaling and is not appropriate when the response of the magnetosphere to external forcing ",
    "i.e. , to the interplanetary motional electric field ( ief )  becomes non - linear and approaches saturation @xcite .",
    "saturation typically sets in at values of the ief @xmath50 68 mv m@xmath15 @xcite . in our case , ief is less than 6  mv  m@xmath15 most of the time ( not shown ) and thus a linear response may be assumed so that this correction should be valid .",
    "_ index is calculated from 13 subauroral stations and is thus more sensitive to high - latitude activity than _",
    "dst_.    figure  [ fig : geoeffects](b ) shows that there are two main decreases in _",
    "dst _ * , with one significant recovery in between .",
    "the first depression was the strongest .",
    "the arrival of the shock and the following brief region of northward imf and increased dynamic pressure were seen as a positive excursion in _ dst _ * , which is known as a sudden impulse ( si ) .",
    "after august 3 19 ut , the imf turned southward and _",
    "dst _ * started a rapid decrease .",
    "imf was primarily negative throughout the sheath region and _ dst _ * remained below -100 nt until august 4 03 ut after which it started to recover .",
    "the leading edge of _ m2 _ arrived at the magnetopause around august 4 04:30 ut , and thus the first _",
    "dst _ * depression was evidently caused by the turbulent sheath region , which , however , lead to a relatively steady southward pointing field , which could be a consequence of the imf draping around the ejecta in the sheath ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dst _ * minimum during this first depression was just below -100  nt at august 4 00 ut , thus it is classified as an intense magnetic storm after @xcite the _ kp _ maximum of 7@xmath159 was reached on august 3 2124 ut . during the second peak the _ kp _",
    "maximum was 6@xmath160 from august 4 1821 ut .    during the passage of _",
    "m2 _ , the gsm @xmath161 component was mainly northward and _ dst _ * recovered . a few hours after the arrival of _ m3 _ at the magnetopause imf turned southward and _",
    "* started its second decrease .",
    "now , the imf maintained steady southward orientation for more than 12 hr , keeping _",
    "dst _ * low .",
    "however , the magnitude of the southward component was only about 5 nt and no severe activity followed .",
    "_ kp _ followed the same pattern as _",
    "dst_*.    as described above , the analyzed compound stream caused _",
    "dst _ * to develop in two distinct steps .",
    "such two - step magnetic storms @xcite are related to the double - structured southward imf , caused typically by a shock - driving south - north ( sn ) cloud , with the shock enhancing previously negative @xmath161 upstream fields .",
    "in such a case , the sheath fields initiate the storm that is further intensified by the following southward fields in the leading part of the cloud @xcite .",
    "shock - driving north - south ( ns)-clouds may also lead to a two - step storm , but with a longer separation between two consecutive _ dst _ * excursions and stronger recovery in between .",
    "if an ns - cloud has sufficiently long duration , the ring current may decay during the first part of the cloud close to the quiet - time levels , and two separate magnetic storms follow ( according to @xcite this happens when the ratio of the magnitudes of the _ dst _ * recovery and the first _",
    "dst _ * depression is larger than 0.9 ) .",
    "however , the two - step storm analyzed in this paper was caused by the complex combination of a sheath region and two interacting mfrs .    as the majority of flux ropes are expected to have ns field rotation during the rising phase of the current solar cycle 24 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is interesting to ask how strong the ring current response would have been if _ m2 _ had ns - polarity instead of sn . to estimate this we used the modified burton s @xmath162 * prediction scheme @xcite for the interval of the compound stream with the sign of @xmath161 reversed during _ m2 _ ( data not shown ) . in this",
    "reversed -@xmath161 case , the compression by _ m3 _ coincided with the southward fields in the end part of _ m2 _ and the following storm had three distinct @xmath162 * excursions , with the strongest depression occurring during the passage of _",
    "m2_. however , the @xmath162 * minimum of the storm was only slightly stronger than when _",
    "m2 _ had original polarity ( -94 and -70 nt for the reversed and real -@xmath161 _ m2 _ cases , respectively ; note that the @xmath162 * model underestimates the strength of the storms ) and the magnitude of the third depression remained about the same ( -64 nt and -58 nt , respectively ) .",
    "although compound streams often cause intense @xmath162 * storms ( see introduction ) it is not clear how much pre - existing ring current affects the storm strength ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the studied event is also a good reminder of the importance of the sheath fields in generating magnetic storms @xcite .",
    "the strongest _",
    "dst _ * depression was caused by the sheath region , and not the magnetic flux ropes .",
    "the magnetic field magnitude in _",
    "m2 _ was high as a result of interaction with _",
    "m3 _ , but the @xmath161 was mainly northward causing the recovery of the _ dst_*. concerning _ m3 _",
    ", we already discussed that it is likely that the earth made only a glancing encounter through this structure .",
    "as a consequence , the magnetic field magnitude was overall low and the following geomagnetic activity was not strong .",
    "the series of events from 2010 july 30 to august 1 gives us a rare opportunity to `` see beyond '' single - spacecraft , in situ observations of icmes .",
    "we are actually unaware of any other series of events which was covered this well by four in situ spacecraft at almost equal longitudinal separations spanning 120@xmath0  in longitude , which is a third of the heliosphere , though of course constrained to the ecliptic plane .",
    "as could be expected for a series of four coronal mass ejections heading clearly towards four out of five spacecraft from which we had the chance to obtain the in situ data , we found a plethora of physical phenomena such as shocks , flux ropes and interactions between various ejecta at these four locations , and attempted to link them into a global picture .      1",
    ".   a shock propagating partly into a previous icme can lead to alterations of the shock structure ; a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite . additionally to this study",
    ", we have derived the approximate shape of the shock , showing it to be clearly non - spherical with respect to the sun , though convex as expected .",
    "this non - spherical shape and a weakening of the shock at the eastern flank is caused ( 1 ) by parts of the shock propagating into a medium carved out by a previous icme , and ( 2 ) a higher initial cme speed of the eruptions on 2010 august 1 on the eastern solar hemisphere .",
    "from the shock normal orientations longitudes , the global shape can be reasonably extrapolated from single - spacecraft observations .",
    "this means that the longitude of the shock normal is pointing east ( west ) of the radial direction to the sun for spacecraft positioned on the eastern ( western ) flank of the shock , in three out of four shock normals ( this was not true for the shock at _ messenger _ ) .",
    "2 .   concerning modeling of the magnetic flux ropes ( mfrs )",
    ", we found a relatively good consistency of the results from applying several methods ( including those of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the mfrs at all in situ locations with the classical picture of icmes as large - scale , bent magnetic tubes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : global_flux](a ) ) .",
    "in particular , we were able to associate _",
    "m3 _ at _ stereo - b _ and _ vex _ as being parts of the same structure by looking at the chirality of the field and the axial field directions , at a longitudinal separation of @xmath163@xmath0 ; in this way , it is also possible to associate _ m3 _ at earth with _",
    "m1 _ at _ messenger _ , though these observations are too separated from each other to make a definitive connection . while the longitudinal picture is consistent with the classical paradigm , looking at the inconsistent inclination of the flux ropes to the ecliptic plane ( figure [ fig : global_flux](c ) ) might point to alterations of the flux rope picture as `` warped '' rather than straight tubes .",
    "one may imagine holding a deformable `` pool noodle '' in one s hands  if deformed from its original circular shape , the inclination to a given plane varies along the axis .",
    "we propose that we found some evidence for this axial `` warping '' in these events and thus , an inclination of a flux rope to the ecliptic plane may be viewed rather as a local quantity than a global one ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "3 .   a shock propagating into a previous eruption can give rise to a rotating magnetic field which can be perfectly modeled with various methods as a small cylindrical flux rope , but could be mistaken for a distinct flux rope originating from a cme ( _ m2 _ at _ stereo - b _ and _ vex _ ) .",
    "this series of events does not qualify as a complex ejecta as defined by @xcite because individual flux rope structures can still be clearly identified and modeled at all spacecraft .",
    "however , some of the parameters have been significantly altered in the interactions that did occur , in accordance with @xcite . at _ wind",
    "_ , in particular , a shock propagated through the preceding mfr , and/or ongoing energy and momentum transfer between the mfrs lead to heating and compression of the plasma ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we think that this series of events , as complex as they are at first glance , may qualify very well as a benchmark test case for space weather prediction models . in numerical simulations for forecasting cmes ,",
    "the outputs of the model runs should be consistent with the arrival times of the shocks and flux ropes , the number of mfrs at each spacecraft and the general profiles of plasma and magnetic field .",
    "first attempts in this direction using cone - shaped ejections were extremely encouraging @xcite , but need to include the flux rope structures in future simulations .",
    "this would make it possible to attempt predictions of the magnetic field components inside the icme , and concerns in particular the ever elusive @xmath161 component ( in gsm coordinates ) which can be directly linked to the strength of the geomagnetic storm ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "situations like the one described in this paper may be expected to be more common during solar maximum .",
    "sympathetic eruptions naturally lead to compound streams composed of several cmes , altering icme properties in distinct ways , sometimes producing more geo - effective flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "new possibilities for serendipitous observations such as these are expected for 2015 , when the _ stereo _ spacecraft will `` cross '' on the other side of the sun as seen from earth . with two additional spacecraft operating in the inner heliosphere at the moment , _ messenger _ at mercury and _ vex _ at venus , and the sun then in its declining phase of the cycle , it might be possible to `` catch '' more icme events on a global scale such as the one presented in this paper . however , these future _ stereo _ directed events might lack the three - dimensional imaging capabilites which can be used for the events in early 2010 august , which is another reason why we think these events are a truly outstanding test case for the space weather community .",
