    "blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) were first identified by @xcite as unusual members of the extragalactic zoo .",
    "a subset of them were later recognized to be nearby low - mass galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the giant  regions in bcgs have low metal - content and blue colours , typical of young ( @xmath410 myr ) stellar populations .",
    "as luck would have it , the first well studied bcgs , viz .",
    ", i  zw  18 and ii  zw  40 turned out to be fairly unrepresentative of the bcg class .",
    "even after 30 years of study of bcgs , i  zw  18 continued to hold the record for the lowest metallicity , while ii  zw  40 is a galaxy pair in an advanced state of merger , which in general is not characteristic of bcgs .",
    "partly because of the extreme properties of these two bcgs , and also because of the other unusual properties of the bcg class as a whole , it was hypothesized that some bcgs , including i  zw  18 , may be undergoing their first burst of star formation .",
    "however , this was quickly recognized as being unlikely , since it was found that the outer parts of many bcgs have red colours , typical of a normal old stellar population .",
    "none the less the idea that a small fraction of bcgs , particularly those with very low metallicity ( i.e. , the extremely metal - deficient ( xmd ) galaxies , with 12  +  log(o / h )  @xmath4  7.65 , or z@xmath4z@xmath5/10 ; see @xcite for a review ) , could be undergoing their first burst of star formation remained popular .",
    "in particular , deep photometry of the unresolved stellar population in outer parts of several xmd bcgs shows no evidence for an old stellar population , e.g. , i  zw  18 ( @xcite ) , sbs  0335052  e , w ( @xcite ; @xcite , but see also @xcite ) , tol  65 ( @xcite ) and ddo  68 ( pustilnik , kniazev & pramskij 2005 ; pustilnik , tepliakova & kniazev 2007 ) . however , resolved cmd are essential to convincingly establish that the current episode of star formation is the first one .",
    "the case of i  zw  18 has been particularly tortuous . from @xmath6 wfpc2 ( @xcite ) and nicmos ( @xcite ) observations of this galaxy , it was argued that i  zw  18 contains agb stars older than 1  gyr and is hence not undergoing its first episode of star formation . however using deeper hst acs observations",
    ", @xcite concluded that i  zw  18 lacked rgb stars and was a bona fide young galaxy .",
    "reanalysis of the same data by other groups indicated that rgb stars were , in fact , present ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite analysed deeper _ hst _ images of i  zw  18 and convincingly established the presence of an rgb population , and hence that i  zw  18 has been forming stars for @xmath7  2  gyr .",
    "one more xmd bcg , sbs  1415 + 437 , which was initially claimed to be a candidate young galaxy ( @xcite ; but see also @xcite , who reached a significantly more limited conclusion : viz .",
    ", its low surface brightness ( lsb ) component luminosity - weighted age is probably not greater than 12  gyr ) , was also found on the basis of _ hst _ based colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) analysis , to have an rgb population with age @xmath71.3  gyr ( @xcite ) .",

    "these three galaxies , a gas column density of @xmath17  atoms  @xmath2does not appear to be either a necessary or sufficient condition for star formation .",
    "note that in all cases , our spatial resolution is comparable or better than the @xmath18  pc linear resolution used to determine the threshold density by skillman ( 1987 ) .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) suggested that star formation is related to the formation of a cold phase of the interstellar medium , and gives fitting formulae for the threshold column density as a function of the gas fraction , pressure , metallicity , ionizing radiation flux , etc .. all other factors being equal , the threshold density increases with increasing gas fraction and decreasing metallicity .",
    "this would imply , on the face of it , that gas rich xmd galaxies should have a higher threshold for star formation than spirals .",
    "however as discussed in detail in @xcite , for determining the star formation threshold in spirals , it is the conditions in the outer portions of the disc that are relevant . in these regions ,",
    "the gas fraction and metallicity are not very different to that in xmd galaxies .",
    "if we assume that that in the outer parts of spiral discs , the gas fraction is 1.0 , the thermal pressure accounts for half the total pressure , the metallicity is 0.1  times the solar metallicity and the @xmath19 radiation intensity is @xmath20@xmath2s@xmath10 , the expected threshold density from equation  ( 23 ) of @xcite is log(n@xmath21 )  @xmath2220.84 . on the other hand , for xmd galaxies , if we take that the gas fraction is @xmath01 , the metallicity is @xmath00.03 solar , but the ratio of thermal pressure to total pressure and the @xmath19 intensity are unchanged , the predicted threshold density is only a factor of @xmath01.4 larger , i.e. , log(n@xmath21 )  @xmath021 . as such",
    ", it appears that a much larger sample will be required to test for the dependence of the threshold density on the gas - phase metallicity .",
    "in table  [ tab : mainpar ] , we summarise the main observed and derived parameters of the studied galaxies .",
    "their @xmath23-band luminosities all fall within a factor of 2.5 , with the average m@xmath2414.3 , while their m ( ) and m()/l@xmath25 ratios differ by less a factor of 1.5 and 1.7 , respectively . in this respect , they form a much more homogeneous sample than the sample of 22 xmd galaxies studied by pustilnik & martin ( 2007 ) .",
    "of course a sample of 3 is too small to draw any meaningful statistical conclusion , this homogeneity is suggestive of similar evolutionary path - ways for all three galaxies",
    ". all of the three galaxies that we have observed also have peculiar  morphology and kinematics .",
    "ugc  772 is located in a loose group , and has easily identifiable neighbours which could be the cause of the observed disturbances .",
    "ddo  68 , on the other hand , is located in a low - density region , in the periphery of the lynx - cancer void ( pustilnik et al .",
    "the hubble flow around ddo  68 is very quiet .",
    "the radial velocities of all six dwarf galaxies within 500  kpc of it differ by less than 40  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the nearest neighbour of ddo  68 , the dwarf galaxy ugc  5427 , is located at a projected distance of @xmath0200  kpc and a radial velocity separation of 5  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "ugc  5427 also has a somewhat disturbed appearance with a chain of bright knots in a spiral - arm like feature , which makes it tempting to suggest that these two galaxies are tidally interacting .",
    "however , given its relatively large projected separation , it seems unlikely that tidal interaction with ugc  5427 is the cause of ddo  68 s disturbed morphology .",
    "for example , if we assume that their true spatial separation and relative velocity are 200  kpc and @xmath050  km  s@xmath10 , respectively , then their close encounter could occur @xmath04  gyr ago .",
    "this is large compared to the ages ( @xmath00.011  gyr ( pustilnik et al . 2005 ; pustilnik et al .",
    "2007 ) ) of the star - formation episodes in ddo  68 .",
    "if interaction with ugc  5427 is not the cause of ddo  68 s disturbed morphology , then a remaining possibility is that ddo  68 represents the late - stage merger of two gas - rich progenitors , in which the gas is now settling down to form a disc . in this context , it is interesting to note that numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) show that a disc galaxy can form in merger of extremely gas - rich progenitors .",
    "mergers are not very rare among bcgs .",
    "e.g. , @xcite also interpret , from the disturbed optical morphology and h@xmath16 kinematics of their sample of bcgs , that they are most likely the results of mergers .",
    "similarly , @xcite assign @xmath015  per  cent of their sample bcgs as having a merger - like morphology .",
    "we use a very approximate calculation below to show that the ages of the oldest stellar populations in ddo  68 ( @xmath01  gyr ) , as derived by pustilnik et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , match with the time of first encounter between its progenitors .",
    "figure  11 of @xcite indicates that ` short ' tails , like those of ddo68 , are seen during later phases of merger ( in comparison to the extended ones produced during the first encounter ) .",
    "their ages are comparable to the rotation period of merging components and one - third of the time since the first encounter . assuming that the velocity of tail relative to the systemic velocity of ddo  68 is @xmath050  km  s@xmath10and its length is @xmath05  kpc , age of tail is @xmath0200  myr , which corresponds to a time since the first encounter of @xmath00.6  gyr .",
    "we note , however , that although the morphology and large - scale kinematics of ddo  68 suggest that it could be an ongoing merger , its large gas - mass fraction , and the lack of evidence for an enhanced velocity dispersion are in conflict with the predictions of numerical models of mergers ( springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and elmegreen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , respectively ) . in the springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) models , the gas - fraction of the merger product is ( f@xmath260.20.3 ) , while ddo  68 is gas - rich ( @xmath272.9 ( table  [ tab : mainpar ] ) ; f@xmath280.95 ( pustilnik et al . 2007 ) ) .",
    "these differences may be , in part , due to the fact that the masses of the putative progenitors of ddo  68 are roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than those of the model galaxies in the elmegreen et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) simulations , and in part , due to limitations in the star formation and feed back recipes used in the simulations . given the importance of gas - rich low - mass mergers in the early universe , a detailed numerical model of ddo  68 would be particularly interesting .",
    "j21040035 is also relatively isolated , and the only other galaxy within 500  kpc and 500  km  s@xmath10  from it is the compact dwarf emission - line galaxy sdss  j210347.23004949.7 ( m@xmath25  =  14.49 ) , which is at a projected distance of 22.3  arcmin ( @xmath0130  kpc for our assumed distance of 20  mpc ) and has , within cited error bars of @xmath05  km  s@xmath10 , the same redshift .",
    "this is the only likely candidate for having caused the observed disturbance in j21040035 .",
    "alternatively we conjecture that j21040035 may be a case of an advanced merger .",
    "it is interesting to note that all three of our sample galaxies have disturbed morphology and kinematics . in this regard",
    ", they closely resemble the three lowest metallicity bcgs , viz .",
    ", i  zw  18 and sbs  0035052  e ,  w. @xcite show that sbs  0035052 consists of an interacting pair of dwarf galaxies with a common  envelope , while @xcite show that i  zw  18 has a complex  distribution , which they describe as a ` fragmenting  cloud in the early stages of galaxy formation ' .",
    "thus , although tidal interaction was not specifically selected for when searching for xmd bcgs , all six of the most metal - deficient galaxies have highly disturbed morphologies and kinematics .",
    "indeed this seems to be a common feature for xmd bcgs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; ekta et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "our , and past , results suggest that interactions / mergers could play an important role in triggering star formation in xmd galaxies .",
    "there are two factors that we can speculatively suggest as being responsible for this .",
    "the first is that intense sf episodes may occur only due to strong tidal disturbances ( particularly , if the gas discs are less susceptible to internal instabilities , see the discussion below ) .",
    "the second is that tidal interaction could lead to a more efficient large - scale mixing of the gas .",
    "this brings lower - metallicity gas from the outer parts of the galaxy to its centre , resulting in a lower metallicity in the central star - forming regions of the gas distribution . in principle",
    ", one could check the validity of this hypothesis by looking for statistical differences in the metallicity of bcgs with and without tidally induced star formation , or by detailed modelling of gas - rich mergers ( e.g. , bekki 2008 ) .",
    "regardless of how the sf is triggered , as far as the relationship between the gas distribution and regions of current sf is concerned , xmd bcgs do not appear to be qualitatively different from other late - type dwarf galaxies with low metallicities . for a sample of dwarf irregular galaxies ( with metallicities mostly in xmd regime ) ,",
    "@xcite find , much as we discuss above , that although sf generally occurs in regions of relatively high  column density , there is no one - to - one relation between gas at high column density and h@xmath16 emission .",
    "this lack of correspondence could be due to several effects , for example , ionization of the gas by @xmath19 radiation from  regions could reduce  column density in regions with strong h@xmath16 flux .",
    "further , since the massive star formation that the h@xmath16 emission traces are short - lived , stochasticity in sf would also reduce the correlation between the instantaneous observed h@xmath16 flux and the  column density .",
    "it is also worth noting that , to the extent that one can determine a threshold density for sf , there does not seem to be any significant difference between xmd galaxies and the more metal - rich dwarfs in the taylor et al .",
    "( 1994 ) sample .    on the other hand , in the model of @xcite a lower limit to the threshold column density can be derived from the largest column densities outside the sites of current sf . in our galaxies",
    "this gas - density ( corrected for inclination and with account of he ) is @xmath02@xmath1110@xmath1  atoms  @xmath2 for ddo  68 and ugc  772 , and @xmath01.22.0@xmath1110@xmath1  atoms  @xmath2 for j21040035 ( as inclination of corresponding region is uncertain , gas - density may lie in the given range ) . for a proper comparison with more metal - rich galaxies ,",
    "however , one would need to compare the column densities at a similar linear resolution .",
    "finally , we note that the baryonic masses of the xmd galaxies in our sample are all sufficiently large ( greater than several 10@xmath13  m@xmath5 ) , such that current star burst is not strong enough to cause a significant loss of metals through escape of metal - enriched gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "the low ism metallicity of these galaxies could be due to a generally subdued star - formation rate in the past ( in case of lsb galaxy progenitor ) .",
    "for those xmds for which no tracers of old stellar population have so far been found in outer parts , the option of this interaction inducing the first sf episode remains a possibility .",
    "1 .   all of the three xmd galaxies observed at the gmrt , viz . ,",
    "ddo  68 , ugc  772 and sdss  j21040035 show disturbed morphology and velocity fields .",
    "2 .   these distortions are suggestive of either an ongoing merging or tidal interaction with companions .",
    "these results , taken together with existing  data for i  zw  18 and sbs  0335052  e and w , suggest that all six of the most metal - poor actively star - forming galaxies in the local universe are either merging or interacting objects .",

    "<S> although there is a debate as to whether these galaxies are undergoing their first episode of star formation or not , they are ` young ' in the sense that their ism is chemically unevolved . in this regard , they are the nearest equivalents of young galaxies in the early universe .    </S>",
    "<S> all three galaxies , that we have observed , have irregular  morphologies and kinematics , which we interpret as either due to tidal interaction with neighbouring galaxies , or the consequences of a recent merger . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining three of the six most metal - deficient galaxies are also known to have highly disturbed  distributions and are interacting . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting because these galaxies were chosen solely on the basis of their metallicity and not for any particular signs of interaction . in this sense ( i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , their gas has not yet had time to settle into a regular disc ) , one could regard these extremely metal deficient ( xmd ) galaxies as ` young ' . </S>",
    "<S> the current star formation episode is likely to have been triggered by interaction / merger . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible that the tidal interaction has lead to enhanced mixing with metal - poor gas in outer disc , and hence to a low gas - phase metallicity in the central star - forming regions .    </S>",
    "<S> we also try to determine the threshold gas - density for star - formation in our sample of galaxies , and find that in general these galaxies do not show a one - to - one correspondence between regions of high  column density and regions with current star formation . </S>",
    "<S> however , to the extent that one can define a threshold density , its value ( @xmath010@xmath1  atoms  @xmath2 ) is similar to that in galaxies with much higher metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> the highest column densities that we detect in regions far outside star - forming regions ( i.e. , a lower limit to the star - formation threshold ) are @xmath310@xmath1  atoms  @xmath2 .    </S>",
