    "a primordial power - law spectrum of density fluctuations in the dark matter ( dm ) ranges from the largest scales above the scales of superclusters of galaxies to the smallest sub - stellar scales according to prediction of inflation models .",
    "this permits to predict the properties of smallest dm structures from the known cmb fluctuations at large scales .",
    "substructures of dm in the galactic haloes with a rather large mass , @xmath1 , were extensively discussed in early works , see for example @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics and mechanism of hierarchical clustering of these large dm clumps were analyzed in both analytical calculations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite . at sub - stellar mass - scales of dm fluctuations ,",
    "a principal new phenomenon arise  the cutoff of mass spectrum due to collisional and collisionless ( free streaming ) damping processes of dm particles in the forming clumps .",
    "the resulting smallest mass of dm clumps is determined by the properties of dm particles , in particular , by their elastic scattering . for detailed calculations of this cutoff",
    "see e.  g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "additionally the cutoff of mass spectrum is influenced by the acoustic absorption @xcite at the time of kinetic decoupling of dm particles @xcite and also by the horizon - scale perturbation modes @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the kinetic equations for dm phase space density were solved in the case of perturbed cosmological background by taking into account the acoustic absorption , horizon - scale modes and gravitational perturbations . a corresponding value of the smallest clump mass for neutralino dm is of the order of the moon or earth mass .",
    "the formation of small - scale dm clumps with a mass larger than the earth mass , @xmath2 , have been explored in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "a resulting differential number density of small - scale clumps , @xmath3 , turns out very close to that obtained in the numerical simulations of large - scale clumps with mass @xmath4 .",
    "the other important result obtained in numerical simulations @xcite is determination of the internal density profile in the isolated clump of minimal mass .",
    "the resulting density profile is approximately a power - law , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , which is in a good agreement with theoretically predicted value @xmath7 according to @xcite .",
    "the number density of small - scale dm clumps existing nowadays in the galactic halo is determined by their tidal destruction during hierarchical structure formation @xcite and also by tidal interactions with stars in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "annihilation of dm particles in small - scale clumps @xcite enhances the total dm annihilation signals in our galaxy and thus boosts a chance for indirect detection of dm .",
    "the usual assumption in calculations of dm annihilation is a spherical symmetry of the galactic halo . in this case",
    "an anisotropy of annihilation gamma - radiation is only due to off - center position of the sun in the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , a principal significance of the halo nonsphericity for the observed annihilation signal was demonstrated in @xcite . according to observations ,",
    "the axes of the galactic halo ellipsoid differ most probably no more than @xmath8% , but even a much more larger difference of axes , up to a factor 2 , can not be excluded @xcite .",
    "this leads to more than an order of magnitude uncertainty in the predicted annihilation flux from the galactic anti - center direction @xcite .",
    "it must be noted also the `` intrinsic '' annihilation anisotropy caused by the small - scale dm clustering itself . a corresponding angular power spectrum of annihilation signal at small scales is connected with a power spectrum of dm clumping @xcite . in principle ,",
    "the dm clumps may be seen as point sources at the gamma - sky @xcite .",
    "another minor source of annihilation anisotropy is a dipole anisotropy due to proper motion of the sun in the galaxy @xcite .    in @xcite the anisotropy with respect to the galactic disk",
    "was discussed basing on the numerical calculations of the destruction of dm clumps by stars in the disk and taking into account the influence of gravitational potential of the disk on the clump orbits .",
    "it was also shown @xcite that ( i ) small - scale dm clumps dominate in the generation of annihilation signal and ( ii ) the galactic stellar disk provides the main contribution to the tidal destruction of clumps at @xmath9  kpc , i.  e. outside the central bulge region .",
    "a process of clump destruction in the halo is anisotropic in general ( e.  g. it depends on the inclination of clump orbit with respect to the disk plane ) . respectively , the dm annihilation in the halo is also anisotropic . in this work",
    "we estimate the value of this anisotropy . it must be stressed that with a present state of art it is impossible to separate this source of anisotropy from that produced by the halo nonsphericity .",
    "more detailed investigation is required to constrain the shape of the halo and to search the distinctive features of annihilation anisotropy due to non - spherical halo clumpinesss .",
    "the detectors at the glast satellite will be sensitive to anisotropy up to @xmath10% level @xcite .",
    "this will provide a hope to discriminate the anisotropic dm annihilation signal from the diffuse gamma - ray backgrounds .",
    "crossing the galactic disk , a dm clump can be tidally destructed by the collective gravitational field of stars in the disk .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to the destruction of globular clusters by the `` tidal shocking '' in the galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the corresponding energy gain per unit mass of a clump at one disk crossing @xcite is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the maximum gravitational acceleration of the clump moving through the disk , @xmath13 is a vertical ( perpendicular to the disk plane ) distance of a dm particle from the clump center , @xmath14 is a vertical component of velocity at disk crossing .",
    "the dependence of @xmath14 on the inclination of orbit relative to the disk plane is the origin of the discussed anisotropy in the clump destruction , and , as a result , the origin of the anisotropy in annihilation signal .",
    "the surface mass of the galactic disk @xcite can be approximated as @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17  kpc , and therefore @xmath18 we use the power - law parametrization @xcite of the internal density of a clump @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mean internal density and a radius of clump , respectively , @xmath22 and @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "the total ( kinetic plus potential ) internal energy of a clump for density profile ( [ rho ] ) is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass of the clump .",
    "integrating ( [ disksh1 ] ) over a clump volume and using the density profile ( [ rho ] ) , one obtains an energy gain for the whole clump as @xmath27 we will use the following criterium for a tidal destruction of clump : a clump is destructed if a total energy gain @xmath28 after several disk crossings exceeds the initial internal energy @xmath29 of a clump .",
    "let us consider now some particular orbit of a clump in the halo with an `` inclination '' angle @xmath30 between the normal vectors of the disk plane and orbit plane .",
    "the orbit angular velocity at a distance @xmath31 from the galactic center is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is an orbital angular momentum of a clump . a vertical velocity of a clump crossing the disk is @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a distance of crossing point from the galaxy center .",
    "there are two crossing points ( with different values of @xmath35 ) during the one orbital period . the momentum approximation used here for calculations of the tidal heating",
    "is violated at small inclination angles , @xmath36 .",
    "nevertheless the resultant anisotropy is a cumulative quantity .",
    "it results from an integration over all clump orbits , and orbits with @xmath36 provide only small input into the anisotropy value .",
    "we use here the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) density profile for the galactic halo : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is normalized in such a way that at position of the sun @xmath39  gev/@xmath40 and @xmath41  kpc .",
    "let us introduce the following set of dimensionless variables : @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is an total orbital energy ( kinetic and potential ) of a clump . in these dimensionless variables the density profile of the halo ( [ nfwhalo ] )",

    "the time of motion from @xmath71 to @xmath52 and back is @xmath72 where @xmath54 depends on @xmath61 , @xmath53 and @xmath62 according to ( [ yexp ] ) .",
    "the trajectory ( the orbit ) of a clump in the potential ( [ pot ] ) is not closed .",
    "a precession angle during the time @xmath73 is @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "therefore the orbital period is greater then @xmath76 and equals to @xmath77 during a life - time of the galaxy , @xmath78  yrs , the relative total energy gain of a clump due to the tidal heating in multiple crossings of the disk is @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are given by ( [ tdisk ] ) for the two disk crossings during an orbital period @xmath82 , and @xmath83 . according to ( [ vzc ] ) the @xmath84-velocity component @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",
    "therefore one has to calculate the sum @xmath87 with summation over all subsequent crossing points ( odd and even ) of a clump orbit with the galactic disk .",
    "an important simplification in calculations follows from the fact that precession velocity is constant . for this reason the points of successive odd crossings are separated by the same angles @xmath88 .",
    "the same is also true for the successive even crossings .",
    "using this simplification one can do the following transformation : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is an equation of clump trajectory in the halo . using the above formulae one finds @xmath91 where @xmath92",
    "a tidal heating and final destruction of clumps by the gravitational field of the galactic disk depends on the inclination angle @xmath30 of a clump orbit to the disk according to ( [ disksh1 ] ) and ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "this is a cause of the anisotropic clump number density decreasing during the lifetime of the galaxy .",
    "a tidally induced anisotropy of clump distribution can be taken into account by inserting into the integral ( [ rhofd ] ) an additional factor @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is an effective time of clump destruction . due to an `` anisotropy '' factor @xmath95 in ( [ a1 ] )",
    "the `` tidal shocking '' by the galactic disk is most effective for clumps with orbit planes which are near coplanar to the disk plane ( that is with an inclination @xmath36 ) .",
    "meanwhile for any intersection points there are many others orbits which pass through the disk plane with @xmath96 .",
    "for this reason the resulting anisotropy in clump distribution is rather small .",

    "this means that a gravitational clustering of small - scale structures proceeds very fast . as a result ,",
    "the formation of small - scale dm clumps and their capturing by the larger ones are nearly simultaneous processes .",
    "the only approach developed to track this clustering is an approximate theoretical model @xcite and restricted numerical simulations @xcite . during the past years the minimum clump mass",
    "is widely discussed .",

    "the crucial problem is a value of the central density of dm clumps . to recover this value a detailed theoretical models and/or high - resolution numerical simulations",
