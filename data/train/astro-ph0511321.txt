    "main sequence b - type stars located far away from the galactic plane are a rare , albeit known phenomenon .",
    "they are believed to be run - away stars ejected from the galactic plane shortly after their formation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . up to recently none of the known run - away b - type stars",
    "were found to have a velocity exceeding the galactic escape velocity .",
    "@xcite discovered a faint late b - type star , sdss  j090745.0@xmath9024507 , with a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath10  @xmath2  ( galactic rest - frame velocity of 709  @xmath2 ) .",
    "this so - called hyper - velocity star ( hvs ) is unbound to the galaxy and @xcite conclude that it was ejected from the galactic center ( gc ) because its radial velocity vector points 173.8  from the latter .",
    "photometric investigations showed it to be a slowly pulsating b - type main sequence star @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicted that velocities as high as 4000  @xmath2  can be gained by the disruption of a binary through interaction with the massive black hole in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "@xcite considered two additional processes that eject hyper - velocity stars in addition to the tidal breakup of binary stars by the central black hole , i.e. close encounters of two single stars and three - body interactions between a star and a binary black hole .",
    "while the ejection rate by close encounters of two single stars is found to be negligible , as much as @xmath11  hvs / yr could be ejected by the tidal breakup scenario and even @xmath12  hvs / yr if the galactic center hosts a binary black hole .",
    "we report the discovery of a second hyper - velocity star , he0437@xmath35439  ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , much brighter ( 162 ) than the hvs sdss  j090745.0 + 024507 .",
    "the star was found during a spectroscopic follow - up campaign of subluminous b ( sdb ) star candidates from the hamburg / eso survey ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "low resolution spectra were obtained on 2001 november @xmath15 at eso , la silla , with the danish 1.5  m telescope and the dfosc spectrograph .",
    "the spectrum of he0437@xmath35439  is very similar to a normal main sequence b - type star .",
    "most remarkable is its very large radial velocity of @xmath16  @xmath2 . to improve this measurement and check for radial velocity variations we observed the star twice again on 2002 november @xmath17 ( 05:00  ut and 08:37  ut ) at the eso paranal observatory using the vlt ut2 8  m telescope ( kueyen ) equipped with the uves high - resolution echelle spectrograph covering the spectral range from 3300 to 6600  at a resolution of 0.2  and a s / n of 5 .",
    "radial velocities were measured with the fitsb2 program @xcite .",
    "the spectra yield the same very high radial velocity of @xmath18  @xmath2  ( 721 and 726  @xmath2 , respectively ) , consistent with that from the low - resolution spectrum . to our knowledge",
    "it is the second largest radial velocity ever measured for a faint blue star at high galactic latitudes .",
    "therefore he0437@xmath35439  qualifies as a hyper - velocity star .    since the star lies at high galactic latitude ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) one has to consider the possibility that it may not be a hot massive star but a low mass evolved star that somehow mimics a main - sequence b - type star @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the high resolution spectra allow us to carry out a detailed quantitative spectroscopic analysis , i.e. to derive temperature and gravity , elemental abundances , and the projected rotational velocity of he0437@xmath35439(section 2 ) in order to prove or disprove its nature as a young massive star .",
    "its mass and distance is then derived from evolutionary tracks ( section 3 ) and the time of flight from the plane is estimated from galactic orbit calculations and compared to its evolutionary life time to search for the likely place of birth ( section [ birth ] ) .",
    "the stellar atmospheric parameters ( effective temperature @xmath4 , surface gravity @xmath21 , and photospheric helium abundance @xmath22 ) were determined by matching synthetic line profiles calculated from model atmospheres to all balmer ( mainly @xmath23 up to @xmath24 ) and hei line profiles present in the observed spectra .",
    "a grid of metal - line blanketed lte model atmospheres @xcite was used .",
    "the models are plane parallel and chemically homogeneous and consist of hydrogen , helium , and metals ( solar abundances ) .",
    "the matching procedure uses a @xmath25 fit technique described by @xcite to determine all three atmospheric parameters simultaneously .",
    "beforehand all spectra were normalized and the model spectra were folded with the instrumental profile ( gaussians with appropriate width ) .",
    "the fit result is shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] .    from the co - added high - resolution spectra we determined the atmospheric parameters to be @xmath26  k , @xmath27  ( cgs ) , and @xmath28 .",
    "the errors are statistical ones . the error budget , however , is dominated by systematic errors . from our previous experiences with the analysis of similar uves spectra @xcite",
    "we adopt @xmath29  k , and @xmath30  ( cgs ) .",
    "taken at face value the helium abundance would be slightly above solar . in order to verify it , we fitted the spectrum again but keeping the he abundance at the solar value .",
    "the quality of the fit is as good as for the simultaneous fit of all three parameters .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the star s helium abundance is solar to within 0.06  dex .",
    "spectra of much better s / n would be needed to narrow down the error range .",
    "the rotational velocity is determined by a @xmath25 fit to the same lines , for which the atmospheric parameters are kept fixed .",
    "synthetic spectra were folded with rotational profiles ( limb darkening coefficient 0.4 ) for various values of @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32  @xmath2  ( @xmath33 error ) results .    because the exposure times were short ( 10  min . )",
    "the spectra are quite noisy",
    ". nevertheless metal lines ( cii , nii , oii , mgii , siii , and sii ) can marginally be measured in the uves spectra . however , due to the rotational line broadening a quantitative abundance analysis is rendered difficult . a rough abundance estimate , however , can be obtained by comparing synthetic spectra to the observation for solar metallicity as well as for twice and half solar values .",
    "the microturbulent velocity was assumed to be zero .",
    "a solar metallicity spectrum appears to be consistent with the data ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) .    in summary",
    ", the results of the quantitative spectral analysis strongly suggest that he0437@xmath35439  is a young massive star since its effective temperature and gravity is typical for main sequence b - type stars .",
    "the normal metallicity supports this interpretation .",
    "while some low mass evolved stars ( hb or post - hb stars ) mimic massive b - type stars to some extent the high rotational velocity and normal helium abundance of he0437@xmath35439  rules out an evolved star , because b - type horizontal branch stars are known to be very slow rotators ( @xmath34 8@xmath2 ) as well as helium deficient @xcite .",
    "hence , there is no doubt that he0437@xmath35439  is a main sequence b - type star .",
    "having shown he0437@xmath35439  to be a main sequence b - type star , we can estimate its mass by comparing its position in the ( @xmath4 , @xmath21 ) diagram to evolutionary tracks ( see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . from solar metallicity models",
    "@xcite we derive @xmath35 , while a slightly lower mass of @xmath36 results from models with @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary time can be interpolated to be about 25  myr for solar composition and about 35  myr for the lower metallicity ( appropriate for the lmc , see sect .",
    "[ birth ] ) . using the mass , effective temperature , gravity and apparent magnitude ( @xmath38 )",
    ", we derive the distance as described by @xcite to @xmath39  kpc .    correcting for the solar reflex motion and to the local standard of rest",
    ", the galactic velocity components can be derived from the radial velocity ( @xmath40  @xmath2 , @xmath41  @xmath2 , and @xmath42  @xmath2 ; u positive towards the gc and v in the direction of galactic rotation ) resulting in a galactic rest - frame velocity of 563  @xmath2 .",
    "this is a lower limit since we assume the proper motion to be zero . using the galactic potential of @xcite",
    "the escape velocity at the position of he0437@xmath35439  is 317  @xmath2  indicating that the star is unbound to the galaxy .",
    "proper motion measurements are needed to reconstruct the full space velocity vector and trace the trajectory of he0437@xmath35439  back to its birth place .",
    "the super - cosmos sky survey @xcite gives @xmath43  @xmath8  and @xmath44  @xmath8 , i.e. consistent with zero and error limits larger than any plausible value .",
    "however , it is possible to compute the flight time for every hypothetical origin in our galaxy .",
    "each starting point corresponds to a unique set of proper motions . however , evaluation is not straightforward , but has to be computed iteratively . since common wisdom has it that the most likely origin for hypervelocity stars is the galactic center , we started by computing the flight time to the center of the milky way .",
    "calculations were performed with the program orbit6 developed by @xcite .",
    "this numerical code calculates the orbit of a test body in the galactic potential .",
    "the complete set of cylindrical coordinates is integrated and positions and velocities are calculated in equidistant time steps .",
    "trial values for the unknown proper motions were varied until the star passed through the gc with an accuracy of better than 10pc .",
    "note , that this is a formal result , which assumes a smooth galactic potential .",
    "however , deviations from the computed path caused by close encounters with e.g. other stars in the central region of the galaxy have only negligible consequences for our considerations .",
    "the result was @xmath45  myrs with a predicted proper motion of @xmath46  @xmath8   and @xmath47  @xmath8 .",
    "such a small proper motion can be measured only by future space missions such as gaia .",
    "the time of flight is much longer than our estimate of the main sequence age of the star ( 25  myrs ) .",
    "this prompted us to investigate whether an origin from another location in the milky way would yield a sufficiently short time of flight .",
    "thus we repeated this procedure for a grid of hypothetical starting points in the galactic plane within a radius of 15  kpc from the galactic center .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] . although the flight times from starting points on the he0437@xmath35439  side of the disk are smaller , they are always larger than 80  myrs , i.e.  more than three times the apparent age of he0437@xmath35439 .",
    "we performed a simple check in order to investigate how much the results depend on the choice of a specific galactic potential : we repeated the procedure described above with the numerical values of the @xcite potential increased by 50% .",
    "this corresponds to an upper limit for the range of escape velocities discussed in literature ( cf .",
    "the resulting flight times were slightly shorter , but never more than 5myrs .",
    "a possible solution of this riddle could be a blue straggler nature of he0437@xmath35439 . in this scenario a close binary consisting of two stars with about @xmath48",
    "was ejected , it came into contact and merged some time after the ejection . since the main - sequence lifetime of a @xmath48 star is 165  myrs @xcite , i.e. larger than the flight time , this could resolve the puzzling age discrepancy . in principle",
    "it would be possible to eject a close binary after the interaction of a hierarchical triple system with the central black hole of the milky way .",
    "however , the necessary kick velocity is so high , that probably a lot of fine tuning would be necessary to allow the binary system to survive .",
    "theoretical calculations testing this scenario are encouraged .",
    "we want to point out here that a lmc origin is a feasible alternative .",
    "the projected distance of he0437@xmath35439  to the kinematic center of the lmc ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ; @xcite ) is @xmath51 .",
    "this corresponds to 14  kpc at the distance of the lmc ( 50  kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "our distance estimate for he0437@xmath35439  was @xmath52  kpc which puts it @xmath53  kpc behind the lmc .",
    "we derive a total distance between he0437@xmath35439  and the center of lmc of @xmath54  kpc .",
    "thus he0437@xmath35439  is much closer to the center of the lmc than to the disk of the milky way .    determined a systematic velocity of the lmc of 262  @xmath2  from a study of a large sample of carbon stars .",
    "thus the relative ( radial ) velocity of he0437@xmath35439  is 461  @xmath2 . if he0437@xmath35439was ejected shortly after its birth about 35  myrs ago from somewhere close to the center of the lmc ( see sect .",
    "[ mass_time_dist ] ) a tangential velocity of 390  @xmath2  would be necessary to explain its current position @xmath55 away from the center .",
    "this corresponds to a proper motion of about 2  @xmath8 , which could be measured by conventional methods from the ground .",
    "the total ejection velocity would amount to 600  @xmath2(neglecting the gravitational potential of the lmc ) close to the value computed for an ejection from the milky way disk .",
    "we conclude that the properties of he0437@xmath35439  could be well explained by the ejection of a single star from the lmc about 35  myrs ago .",
    "it is not necessary to invoke a blue straggler scenario , which requires a fair amount of fine tuning .",
    "we have shown that he0437@xmath35439  is an early b - type hyper - velocity star .",
    "both , chemical abundances and a moderate rotational velocity of he0437@xmath35439  provide strong evidence for a main sequence nature of this object .",
    "it is considerably more massive than the first object of this class , sdss  j090745.0@xmath9024507 , which puts tight constraints on the flight time since he0437@xmath35439 s ejection .",
    "tidal disruption of a close binary by the massive black hole at the gc has been suggested to explain the hvs .",
    "however , an origin from the center or the disk of the milky way is at variance with its age .",
    "although it is possible to reconcile the age constraint via a blue straggler scenario , we showed that an ejection from the lmc is more plausible .",
    "our lmc scenario makes two predictions : firstly , we expect that the abundances of he0437@xmath35439  should correspond to the lmc metallicity , which is about half solar . secondly , we predict a proper motion relative to the lmc of 2  @xmath8  or higher , depending on the precise location and time of the he0437@xmath35439  ejection . unlike the proper motion predicted for ejection from the galactic center , the proper motion is large enough to be possibly measurable from the ground .",
    "if an origin in the lmc can be confirmed , this would allow to proof that either the lmc contains a  so far undetected  very massive black hole , or that other mechanisms are capable of producing hvs as well .",
    "we thank the staff of the eso la silla and paranal observatories for their valuable support .",
    "we made extensive use of nasas astrophysics data system abstract service ( ads ) and the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
