    "_ cgro _ batse and _ beppo - sax _ observations of grbs have renewed interest in relativistic blast - wave models .",
    "the batse observations ( meegan et al .  1992 ; fishman & meegan 1995 ) indicate that grbs originate from cosmological distances and therefore involve impulsive releases of energy exceeding @xmath6 ergs ( assuming isotropic emission ) .",
    "the _ beppo - sax _ observations of x - ray afterglows from grb 970228 ( costa et al .",
    "1997 ) and grb 970508 ( piro et al.1997 ) led to the first optical counterpart identifications of grb sources ( van paradijs et al .  1997 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "1997 ) , culminating in the detection of absorption lines from the optical counterpart to grb 970508 , showing that it lies at redshift @xmath7 ( metzger et al .",
    "the x - ray emission from grb 970228 decays as a power - law @xmath8 between @xmath9 s and one week following the grb ( costa et al.1997 ) , where @xmath10 is the observer time .",
    "the optical counterpart of grb 970228 decays @xmath11 between 0.6 days and 189 days following the burst , though it exhibits apparent fluctuations from a simple power - law ( galama et al .",
    "1997 ; garcia et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the x - ray afterglow of grb 970508 displays a peak at about 2 days following the burst , with an underlying power law decline @xmath12 from the end of the main phase of the burst at about 30 sec to @xmath13 days following the grb ( piro et al .",
    "the optical flux of grb 970508 appears to be roughly constant between @xmath14 hrs and 1 day , whereupon it subsequently rises and likewise peaks at @xmath15 days after the burst ( djorgovski et al.1997 ; sahu et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "the optical emission thereafter declines @xmath16 ( garcia et al.1997 ) . the 4.86 ghz radio emission from grb 970508",
    "was first detected @xmath14 days after the grb , is rapidly variable ( evidently due to interstellar scintillation ; goodman 1997 ) though with an overall flat time profile until @xmath17 days following the burst , after which it begins to monotonically decline ( frail et al.1997 ) .",
    "because of these observations , much interest has been focused on the hydrodynamical study of relativistic blast waves by blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) , which has been applied to grbs by rees , mszros , & coworkers in a series of papers ( e.g. , mszros & rees 1993 , 1997 ; mszros , rees , & papathanassiou 1994 ; wijers , rees , & mszros 1997 ; panaitescu & mszros 1997 ) devoted to understanding the prompt grb emision and the long wavelength afterglows .",
    "vietri ( 1997a , b ) used the results of blandford & mckee in the radiative regime to explain the delayed x - rays , and waxman ( 1997a , b ) applied the blast wave model to the long wavelength afterglows .",
    "mszros , rees , & wijers ( 1997 ) have derived power - law time profiles for delayed emission in different regimes assuming analytic models for the ism density distribution .",
    "here we reframe the hydrodynamical approach by deriving an equation for plasmoid dynamics in terms of the comoving particle distribution functions .",
    "this permits the radiation physics to be treated in the comoving frame , and the plasmoid dynamics to be calculated self - consistently .",
    "this approach can be applied , with appropriate modifications , to temporal studies of blazar emissions which are also thought to result from relativistic plasma outflows .",
    "blazar flares , which vary on time scales as short as hours to days in the 1 mev - 1 tev regime ( e.g. , michelson et al .  1994 ; catanese et al .",
    "1997 ) , are in this picture due to the reconversion of directed kinetic energy of the outflowing plasmoid by interactions with the ism ( see hartman et al .  1997 and shrader & wehrle 1997 for recent reviews of blazar observations ) .",
    "we suggest that the passage of the relativistic plasma outflow through a cloud - like density enhancement could initiate such a flare .    in  2",
    ", we derive an equation for plasmoid dynamics in terms of the evolving comoving particle distribution functions .",
    "reduction to well - known forms in the non - radiative and radiative regimes is performed in  3 .",
    "prescriptions for the energy transfer from nonthermal protons to electrons , which get us past the difficult particle acceleration and plasma physics which can be implemented in later studies , are proposed in  4 . in  5 , we treat the optically thin synchrotron radiation process , and effects of parameter changes are presented in  6 .",
    "the results are examined analytically in  7 , and application to grbs and blazars is made in  8 .",
    "we summarize in  9 .",
    "a detailed numerical treatment is presented in a companion paper ( chiang & dermer 1997b ) .",
    "we consider the system shown in fig .  1 .",
    "a plasmoid , consisting of a volume of magnetized plasma , is located on the @xmath18-axis at location @xmath0 and moves with lorentz factor @xmath19 .",
    "the comoving volume of the plasmoid is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the area of the plasmoid at @xmath0 and @xmath22 is the mean width of the plasmoid as measured in the comoving frame .",
    "the plasmoid travels through an external medium with density @xmath23 which is assumed to be fully ionized electron - proton plasma .",
    "consequently the plasmoid captures an electron - proton pair of the ism gas if the proton larmor radius is much smaller than the characteristic size scales ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) of the plasmoid .",
    "except for chance collisions , neutral particles would pass through the plasmoid unless they are ionized by interactions with the plasmoid .",
    "the plasmoid is assumed to consist initially of thermal lepton - proton plasma which was ejected from the grb event . in our notation , @xmath26 ergs and @xmath27 ergs ,",
    "so that the mass of the thermal particles in the plasmoid is just @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the total number of protons in the plasmoid ejecta .",
    "the factor @xmath30 corrects for the mass of electrons and pairs , the latter of which are assumed to be present in the ratio @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number of thermal positrons .",
    "here we assume that @xmath33 and @xmath34 , so that the thermal kinetic energy is a small fraction of the rest mass energy of the particles .",
    "we furthermore adopt the notation that @xmath35 stands for the proton ( electron ) momentum distribution function @xmath36 $ ] differential in dimensionless momentum @xmath37 ( not to be confused with the subscript @xmath38 which stands for proton ) , and that @xmath39 stands for the spatial gradient @xmath40/\\partial x$ ] of the proton ( electron ) momentum distribution function , where @xmath41 is the time in the comoving frame .",
    "if the nonthermal particles are isotropically distributed in the comoving frame ( see discussion in dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ) , then the relativistic mass @xmath42 of nonthermal particles is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44m_e / m_p$ ] is the additional relativistic mass in the form of nonthermal leptons , and @xmath45 is the momentum - dependent pair ratio in the nonthermal lepton distribution .",
    "the x - component of the relativistic momentum of the plasmoid at location @xmath0 , denoted @xmath46 , is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the speed of the plasmoid . at @xmath50 , the total x - component of the momentum of the plasmoid , including the swept - up particles and radiated photons , is given by @xmath51 @xmath52\\ } -{\\delta x \\over c}\\int_0^\\infty dp\\ ; ( \\dot\\gamma_p n_p + \\dot\\gamma_e n_e).\\eqno(2)\\ ] ] the last integral in this equation refers to the momentum carried by radiated photons , and is related to the internal particle distribution functions through the comoving frame energy - loss rates @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the protons and electrons , respectively .",
    "this formalism allows for particle creation and annihilation , although in this paper we assume for simplicity that @xmath55 .",
    "we furthermore set @xmath56 so that no particles are added to the thermal pool .",
    "this does not impose any loss of generality if the nonthermal particles are followed to nonrelativistic energies .",
    "expanding equation ( 2 ) in powers of @xmath57 , equating to @xmath46 by momentum conservation and retaining terms to first order in @xmath57 , we obtain the equation @xmath58    the proton and electron injection function due to the plasmoid sweeping up particles from the ism is given by @xmath59 equation ( 4 ) says that protons and electrons are injected into the comoving plasma with momenta @xmath60 at a rate determined by the ism density @xmath23 and area @xmath21 of the plasmoid . when radiation is important , the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) contain terms in addition to the sweep - up functions ( 4 ) due to the evolution of the comoving particle distribution functions .",
    "by multiplying the particle continuity equation by @xmath63 and integrating over @xmath64 , using the relation @xmath65 , we find that @xmath66\\over \\partial \\gamma}\\ } = \\int_1^\\infty d\\gamma \\ ; [ \\gamma\\dot n(\\gamma)-\\dot\\gamma n(\\gamma ) ] = b\\gamma c\\int_1^\\infty d\\gamma\\;\\gamma n_{\\rm sw}^\\prime\\ ; , \\eqno(5)\\ ] ] noting that @xmath67|_1^\\infty = 0 $ ] .",
    "consequently the numerator in equation ( 3 ) contains only the contribution from the sweep - up function ( 4 ) , and we arrive at the result @xmath68 note that we have neglected the energy content in magnetic field in equation ( 3 ) by assuming that it is small in comparison with that of the thermal and nonthermal particle energies .",
    "the importance of the magnetic energy term can be checked once the plasmoid volume is specified , and can be important if equipartition is assumed between the magnetic field and nonthermal particle energy densities . for the applications presented here ,",
    "however , we assume that this term is negligible .",
    "the relation between the comoving time @xmath41 and spatial coordinate @xmath0 is given by @xmath69 the terms @xmath70 and @xmath71 in equation ( 7 ) stand for the initial location and comoving time when the parameter values are specified .",
    "the nonthermal power from swept - up protons and leptons is probably dominated by the proton component in the ism environment surrounding a grb source , though a substantial pair content could be found in the vicinity of supermassive black holes which power blazars .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the swept - up matter is pair free , we can therefore write that the power injected in nothermal particles per unit comoving time is given by @xmath72 . using equation ( 4 ) , we therefore see that the kinetic energy injected per unit time is @xmath73 ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) , neglecting the power in swept - up electrons .",
    "vietri ( 1997a , b ) has used this equation to predict grb afterglow behavior assuming that the bulk of the nonthermal particle energy is radiated on a time scale short compared to the time scale for the evolution of @xmath74 , i.e. , that the plasmoid is in the radiative regime .    when particle radiation is negligible , @xmath75 , and the evolution of the particle distribution function is entire due to the sweep - up nonthermal particles .",
    "under these conditions , equation ( 6 ) reduces to @xmath76 equation ( 9 ) describes the dynamics of the plasmoid in the _ non - radiative _ regime . if the particle kinetic energy is promptly radiated away , leaving behind only the rest mass of the initial and swept - up particles  which is dominated by the mass of the protons",
    " then equation ( 6 ) reduces to @xmath77 this equation describes the dynamics of the plasmoid in the _ radiative _ regime .",
    "asymptotic forms for plasmoid dynamics in the non - radiative and radiative regime are simply derived for a relativistic ( @xmath78 ) plasmoid .",
    "we parameterize the plasmoid area by the expression @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a collimation ( or beaming ) factor and @xmath81 is the solid angle into which the plasmoid is directed . equation ( 11 ) reduces to an uncollimated blast wave when @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we parameterize the spatial dependence of the external density distribution by the expression @xmath84 and assume that the plasmoid lorentz factor follows the power - law behavior @xmath85 where @xmath4 is the initial plasmoid lorentz factor .    in the early free - expansion stage ,",
    "the plasmoid is ballistic so that @xmath86 .",
    "transition to power - law behavior in both the non - radiative and radiative regimes occurs when the relativistic mass @xmath87 of the swept - up particles equals the original mass @xmath88 in the burst ejecta .",
    "this occurs when @xmath89 where the equality on the right - hand - side relates the initial energy @xmath90 ergs of the grb explosion or blazar flare to @xmath29 .",
    "one finds that @xmath91^{1/3 } = 3.9\\times 10^{15 } [ { ( j+1-\\eta)e_{50}\\over   f_b n_0\\gamma_{300}^2}]^{1/3}\\;{\\rm cm}\\ ; , \\eqno(15)\\ ] ] where @xmath92 .",
    "this reduces to the result of rees & mszros ( 1992 ) when @xmath82 , @xmath93 , and @xmath83 .    substituting equations ( 11)-(13 ) into equation ( 9 ) ,",
    "one obtains @xmath94 so that equation ( 9 ) has a power - law solution in the non - radiative regime provided @xmath95 note that the index @xmath96 in the non - radiative regime equals 3/2 for the blast - wave case with uniform external density ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the power - law behavior persists until the plasmoid reaches location @xmath97 defined by @xmath98 . for the asymptotic form ( 13 ) , we have @xmath99      the plasmoid lorentz factor in the fully radiative regime follows power - law behavior for @xmath100 , where @xmath97 is the location at which the mass of the swept - up matter equals the initial rest mass of particles in the grb ejecta .",
    "when @xmath101 , we can simply see from equation ( 10 ) that @xmath102 , so that @xmath103 alternately , we can solve equation ( 10 ) directly when the integral in the denominator on the right - hand - side of equation ( 8) can be neglected .",
    "for a blast - wave geometry in a uniform external medium , @xmath104 ( blandford & mckee 1976 ; see also rees & mszros 1992 ; mszros et al .",
    "the power - law behavior in the radiative regime ends at the location @xmath97 determined by the condition @xmath105 if @xmath106 , this implies @xmath107 the power - law behavior ends when @xmath98 . using equations ( 18 ) and ( 19 )",
    ", we therefore find that @xmath70 is also given by equation ( 15 ) in the radiative regime .",
    "figure 2 shows a numerical solution of @xmath19 along with the asymptotic forms in the radiative and non - radiative regimes for our standard parameter values @xmath108",
    ", @xmath109 @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath82 , @xmath93 , and @xmath83 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the bulk of the energy injected into a relativistic plasmoid which sweeps up matter from the ism is carried by nonthermal protons , yet in all likelihood the dominant radiation process in grb afterglows is nonthermal electron synchrotron radiation ( see , e.g. , waxman 1997a ; tavani 1997 ; katz & piran 1997 ; and discussion in chiang & dermer 1997a ) .",
    "it is also generally thought that the bulk of the radio - through - optical blazar emission is nonthermal electron synchrotron radiation .",
    "a mechanism transfers the energy from the proton to the electron population , for example , through shocks or the excitation of plasma wave turbulence by the protons which gets channeled into the electrons through gyroresonant coupling .",
    "we avoid the complicated microphysical details of the energy transfer process by offering two simple prescriptions for the transfer of energy from the protons to the electrons .    in the first prescription , we assume that a fraction @xmath112 of the kinetic energy power of the swept - up nonthermal protons in the comoving frame is instantaneously transformed into a  shock \"- like momentum power - law electron distribution with index @xmath113 .",
    "hence @xmath114 naive shock acceleration theory predicts @xmath115 and @xmath116 for strong shocks in nonrelativistic gases ( e.g. jones & ellison 1991 ) .",
    "consideration of relativistic gases and inclusion of nonlinear effects can produce harder power law injection with @xmath117 ( e.g. ellison , jones , & reynolds 1990 ) , and stochastic gyroresonant acceleration can produce extremely hard power - law and even quasi - monoenergetic spectra ( see schlickeiser , campeanu , & lerche 1993 ) . in equation ( 22 ) , the normalization coefficient @xmath118 , where @xmath119 provided @xmath120 and @xmath121 . if @xmath122 , then @xmath123    a second prescription for the energy transfer from protons to electrons is @xmath124 where @xmath125 note that the energy transfer time scale @xmath126 and the total proton kinetic energy @xmath127 are @xmath0- ( or equivalently @xmath41- ) dependent quantities .",
    "the second prescription is probably a better representation of the actual physics of the situation but affords less analytic development .",
    "the limit of complete , prompt energy transfer from the protons to the electrons corresponds to @xmath128 and @xmath129 in the first and second prescriptions , respectively .",
    "the electron injection function at time @xmath130 in the comoving frame for the first prescription is therefore @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the injection momentum and @xmath133 is the heaviside function defined by @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 otherwise .",
    "the evolution of the electron energy through synchrotron radiation is governed by the well - known equation @xmath137 assuming an isotropic electron pitch - angle distribution .",
    "we also suppose that the magnetic field is randomly oriented with mean field strength @xmath138 in our spectral calculations . in general ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath138 with @xmath0 involves subtleties .",
    "the assignment of an equipartition strength in grb studies depends on knowledge of the local density which can be obtained through the shock jump conditions ( e.g. , waxman 1997a ; mszros et al .",
    "1997 ) . the magnetic field could be generated through turbulent field growth , or evolve from the original field in the plasmoid ( mszros et al .",
    "1994 ) , for example , by flux freezing ( see chiang & dermer 1997a ) .",
    "our major simplification in the present study is to examine the case @xmath140 and @xmath141 , with @xmath142 and @xmath143 independent of @xmath0 .",

    "we treat only the effects of synchrotron losses on the evolution of the electron spectra .",
    "the electron distribution at time @xmath41 resulting from the superposition of nonthermal electron power - law injection functions described by equation ( 27 ) over the time interval @xmath147 is therefore @xmath148}^t dt_i\\;k\\;[p^{-1}-\\nu_0(t - t_i)]^{s-2}\\;,\\eqno(30)\\ ] ] where we assume that @xmath149 and @xmath150 are independent of @xmath41 .",

    "the time profiles in this regime consequently decay more slowly than in the strongly cooled regime .",

    "table 2 shows the derived slopes of the flux time profiles for emission in the fully radiative uncooled and cooled regimes when @xmath246 , which happens when the incoming energy is not fully radiated  and which must be the case in view of the fact that there are still some nonthermal electrons which are radiating energy ",
    "the slopes are less negative than given here , so that the profiles decay more slowly . a numerical calculation ( chiang & dermer 1997b )",
    "is required to determine the slopes of the time profiles in this regime . in the extreme non - radiative regime , where @xmath247 , the amount of radiated energy is negligible , and the slopes of the time profiles are harder by @xmath248 units .",
    "the derived slopes in the fully non - radiative regime are also listed in table 2 , as well as the difference in slopes between the cooled and uncooled regimes .",

    "this also yields the observer time @xmath251 when synchrotron cooling starts to strongly regulate the number of electrons which produce synchrotron emission at some observed energy . for times",
    "@xmath252 or , equivalently , @xmath253 , we can use equation ( 41 ) to write @xmath254 and equation ( 43 ) to write @xmath38 in terms of the observed photon energy @xmath180 . after a tedious derivation ,",
    "one obtains the result @xmath255 the term @xmath256 . when @xmath257 , @xmath258 when @xmath259 , @xmath260 the time at which synchrotron cooling effects begin to play an important role are very weakly dependent upon all parameters except @xmath142 and the observed photon energy @xmath180 .",
    "the accuracy of equation ( 53 ) can be checked against figs .",
    "4 and 5 using @xmath261 . in fig . 6",
    ", the mszros - rees timescale @xmath262 is longer than @xmath263 , so that synchrotron cooling effects are always important by the time the plasmoid lorentz factor enters the power - law asymptote regime described by equation ( 13 ) .",
    "we use our results to make preliminary comparison with observations of delayed afterglow behaviors of grbs noting , however , that a detailed numerical scheme is required to calculate accurately the time profiles of the afterglows .",
    "it seems likely that the x - ray and optical grb afterglow emission is primarily observed in the regime where synchrotron cooling plays an important role in the nonthermal electron content which produces this radiation ( see eqs.[53 ] and [ 54 ] ) . from table 2",
    ", we see that the slopes of the time profiles in this  cooled \" regime , whether in the non - radiative limit or the radiative limit , are fairly narrowly bracketed .",
    "irrespective of the electron injection index @xmath113 in the range @xmath264 , the slopes @xmath265 lie between the values of @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "if the optical and x - ray afterglow indeed occur in the regime where synchrotron cooling is important , then @xmath268 ( see eq.[49 ] ) . for grb 970228 ,",
    "@xmath269 ( e.g. waxman 1997a ) , and for grb 970508 , @xmath270 ( djorgovski et al.1997 ) , implying @xmath271 in both cases .",
    "such a spectrum can be produced by nonlinear effects in a relativistic shock ( ellison et al .",
    "the radiative regime with @xmath244 is suggested on energetic grounds ( vietri 1997b ) . from table 2 , we see that a relativistic blast wave decelerating in a uniform medium yields temporal slopes in the range @xmath272 when @xmath273 .",
    "these values are in striking accordance with the slopes of the measured afterglow behaviors ( see  1 ) , particularly in view of an additional hardening of the temporal slopes expected from the fact that the radiative regime can never fully be achieved .    against the apparent successes of the relativistic blast wave model in explaining the slopes of the afterglow time profiles , several difficulties must be mentioned : ( 1 ) the characteristic grb spectral shape can not be reproduced with the model presented here , which gives a 1/2 power break due to incomplete synchrotron cooling rather than a more typical break of about one unit from the hard x - rays to the soft gamma rays . this problem can be ameliorated by the inclusion of relativistic shock effects which produce time - varying equipartition magnetic fields and shock - heated low - energy cutoffs in the electron momentum distribution , and will be dealt with elsewhere ( chiang & dermer 1997b ) .",
    "( 2 ) the short time - scale variability and the large diversity of grb time profiles are not accounted for here , and probably can not result from variations in the external medium ( fenimore , madras , & nayakshin 1996 ; sari & piran 1995 ) , though internal shocks may suffice ( see kobayashi , piran , & sari 1997 ) . ( 3 ) the tendency of the peak in the @xmath274 spectrum of grbs to be in the range 0.1 - 1 mev  which is probably not due to selection effects ( harris & share 1998 )  remains unexplained by this model .",
    "( 4 ) finally , the peaking of the x - ray and optical time profiles two days after grb 970508 is unexpected .",
    "6 shows extreme parameters which produce a delayed peaking of the x - ray and optical ranges , but implies an accompanying long term gamma - ray production phase . the x - ray and optical feature at 2 days after grb 970508",
    "must therefore originate from another effect , for example by relativistic beaming due to a collimated plasmoid ( chiang & dermer 1997a ) or by a density enhancement which the expanding shell traverses as it decelerates .",
    "the most extreme flaring behavior of blazars occurs in the gamma - ray regime , with luminosities @xmath275 exceeding @xmath276 ergs s@xmath216 and gamma - ray variability taking place on time scales @xmath277 days , with @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "the eddington limit for a @xmath280 black hole is @xmath281 ergs s@xmath216 .",
    "if the jet luminosity represents a significant fraction of the eddington luminosity and is collimated into 0.1 - 1% of the full sky , then @xmath282 black holes could power such flares .",
    "this interpretation is also consistent with a minimum variability time scale defined by the schwarzschild radius of the black hole , which is about 15 minutes when @xmath283 .",
    "interactions of the jet plasma with clouds in the external medium could provide a mechanism for transforming the kinetic energy of the jet power into the emitted radiation .",
    "certain conditions have to be met for this interpretation to be valid .",
    "in particular , the clouds have to be ( i ) small enough to be in accord with the observed variability time scale , ( ii ) dense and massive enough to afford efficient conversion of the plasmoid energy into radiation , ( iii ) close enough to the central black hole so that a cloud can pass through the volume traversed by the jet on a time scale of order days , ( iv ) large enough to occult a large portion of the jet , and ( v ) numerous enough to agree with the blazar flare duty cycle .    neglecting redshift factors in these estimates",
    ", we see that condition ( i ) implies that @xmath284 , so that the cloud radius @xmath285 cm , where @xmath286 . assuming that the plasmoid is highly radiative , equation ( 8) gives @xmath287 , where @xmath288 cm is the distance of the cloud from the supermassive black hole . condition ( ii ) therefore implies that @xmath289 @xmath290 @xmath110 . in the fully radiative limit ,",
    "we see from equation ( 20 ) that a plasmoid will be decelerated to nonrelativistic speeds if the number of swept - up particles roughly equals the number of jet particles .",
    "consequently we find that the cloud mass @xmath291 , so that @xmath292 ergs .",
    "for a spherical cloud , we therefore see that @xmath293 @xmath110 , where we define @xmath294 .    for condition ( iii )",
    ", we find that the cloud takes @xmath295 days to travel one degree if the clouds follow circular orbits , and could therefore traverse the jet opening angle on a time scale of several days for the given parameters .",
    "condition ( iv ) is satisfied if @xmath296 ) , where @xmath297 is the jet opening angle .",
    "the duty cycle of flares is not well known due to the sparse sampling of blazars , but might be in the range of 1 - 10% .",
    "condition ( v ) therefore translates into a covering factor of comparable value as the duty cycle .",
    "the interpretation that blazar flares could result from relativistic plasma outflows interacting with clouds is therefore consistent with observations if marginally thomson thick clouds of radii @xmath298 cm are located some hundreds to thousands of schwarzschild radii from the central supermassive black holes .",
    "a method is presented in this paper to treat the dynamics of a volume of relativistically moving magnetized plasma  a plasmoid  that sweeps up material from the interstellar medium and whose entrained nonthermal particles radiate their internal kinetic energy , thereby changing the relativistic inertia of the plasmoid .",
    "the formalism is cast in terms of particle distribution functions in the comoving plasmoid frame : these functions evolve when particles are swept - up , when energy is transferred between the hadronic and leptonic components in the plasmoid , and when energy is lost to radiation .",
    "such an approach is open - ended in the sense that more complicated scenarios not dealt with here can be treated , such as the inclusion of other radiation processes ( e.g. , compton scattering and bremsstrahlung , and secondary and photo - meson production ) , of diffusive escape of nonthermal particles from the plasmoid , and of pair and compactness effects and the microphysical details of particle acceleration within the plasmoid .",
    "we have studied a highly idealized system consisting of a relativistic blast wave or plasmoid with a constant entrained magnetic field .",
    "only optically - thin synchrotron processes were treated here , and it was assumed that a fixed fraction of the swept - up nonthermal proton energy is instantaneously transformed into a power - law nonthermal electron momentum spectrum .",
    "this model was completely solved in the limit of a relativistic plasmoid whose lorentz factor follows the power - law behavior given by equation ( 13 ) .",
    "this solution can be used to benchmark numerical codes that include additional processes .",
    "application of these results to studies of gamma - ray bursts and blazars was indicated , and will be developed more thoroughly in a numerical examination of the system .",
