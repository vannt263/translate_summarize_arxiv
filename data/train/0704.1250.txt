    "the unified theory of seyfert ( sy ) type active galactic nuclei ( agn ) holds that all types of sy agn are essentially the same object , viewed from different lines of sight ( los ) . surrounding the central engine",
    "is a geometrically and optically thick , dusty , molecular torus , obscuring the broad emission line region from some los . in this scheme ,",
    "the sy classification depends solely on the los and exact torus properties .",
    "such theories received a major boost through the detection of scattered , and hence polarized , broad emission lines in the spectrum of ngc1068 @xcite , revealing an obscured sy 1 central engine in the previously classified sy 2 agn , entirely consistent with unified theories .",
    "whilst fundamental to unified theories , the torus remains difficult to image directly at optical / ir wavelengths , with perhaps the most direct observation of the torus made by speckle interferometry in the near - ir @xcite .",
    "strong evidence for significant amounts of obscuring material in the central 100pc - scale nuclear regions of ngc1068 , possibly in the form of a torus , is provided by observations of co and hcn emission @xcite , and recent chandra x - ray observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy reveals a moderately deep ( @xmath2 ) silicate absorption feature at the nucleus @xcite , whose strength is approximately constant up to @xmath31  south of the brightest mid - ir point @xcite .",
    "applying the @xcite clumpy torus model , @xcite suggested the torus is compact ( @xmath4pc ) , in good agreement with mid - ir interferometric observations @xcite .",
    "further evidence for a compact torus was found through ao fed h@xmath5 1 - 0s(1 ) observations @xcite , finding a 15pc clump of h@xmath5 extending from the nucleus at the same pa as the line of masers .",
    "the observed extent of the torus , or nuclear obscuring material in ngc1068 , is partly dependent on the wavelength and/or observational technique .",
    "@xcite used imaging polarimetry to observe the silhouette of obscuring material against the southern ionization cone , which they attributed to the torus , with a derived diameter of @xmath3200pc in the h - band .    the close proximity",
    "( 1@xmath6 @xmath7 72pc ) and high brightness of ngc1068 makes it an ideal target for polarimetry , a traditionally photon - starved application .",
    "near - ir studies of ngc1068 by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite clearly detected the bi - conical ionization structure in scattered light .",
    "in the nuclear regions , there is a trend to a position angle ( pa ) of polarization being perpendicular to the radio jet with increasing wavelength .",
    "modeling of the nuclear regions requires both an extended area of scattering particles as well as dichroic absorption of nuclear emission , possibly by dust in , or associated with , the torus ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that the pa of polarization rotates by @xmath370@xmath8 between 4 and 5@xmath0 m .",
    "the 10@xmath0 m spectropolarimetry of @xcite showed a similar pa of polarization to that at 5@xmath0 m , and a constant degree of polarization through the silicate absorption feature .",
    "these results are entirely consistent with the predicted 90@xmath8 change from dichroic absorption to dichroic emission from aligned dust grains . that the pa change was only @xmath370@xmath8",
    "is attributable to dilution of the dichroic emission component by polarized flux in the extended scattering cones , most likely from dichroic emission from dust in the narrow emission line region ( nlr ) @xcite .    to investigate the contributions of the various polarizing mechanisms and structures in the nucleus of ngc1068 , @xcite performed imaging polarimetry using a broad - band 8 - 13  @xmath0 m filter .",
    "these data represented the first and only published mid - ir imaging polarimetry of an agn , but their interpretation was complicated by the @xmath30.7   resolution of the data . to take advantage of the improved spatial resolution attainable from an 8 m - class telescope",
    ", we obtained new mid - ir imaging polarimetry of ngc1068 during commissioning of this mode at the gemini north telescope .",
    "we obtained imaging polarimetry of ngc1068 during commissioning of the polarimetry unit of michelle @xcite on ut 2005 december 19 on the gemini north 8.1 m telescope .",
    "these observations were primarily aimed at measuring the degree and position angle ( pa ) of polarization with ngc  1068 as a test object , and hence used a limited on - source time of 148 seconds .",
    "michelle uses a raytheon 320 x 240 pixel si : as ibc array , providing a plate scale of 0.1@xmath6 per pixel in imaging mode .",
    "images were obtained in the 9.7@xmath0 m ( @xmath9@xmath10 = 1.0@xmath0 m , 50@xmath11 cut - on / off ) filter only , using the standard chop - nod technique to remove time - variable sky background , telescope thermal emission and so - called  1/f \" detector noise .",
    "the chop throw was 15@xmath6 and the telescope was nodded every @xmath390 s. the chop throw was fixed at 0@xmath8 ( n - s ) .",
    "conditions were photometric and the observations were diffraction limited ( @xmath30.30fwhm ) .",
    "michelle employs a warm , rotatable half wave retarder ( or half wave plate , hwp ) to modulate the polarization signal , located upstream of the entrance window of the dewar .",
    "a cold wire grid polarizer is used as the polarimetric analyzer , located in a collimated beam .",
    "images were taken at four hwp pas in the following sequence : 0@xmath8 , 45@xmath8 , 45@xmath8 , 0@xmath8 , 22.5@xmath8 , 67.5@xmath8 , 67.5@xmath8 , 22.5@xmath8 in the first nod position , and the sequence repeated in the second nod position . in this manner ,",
    "the stokes parameters can be computed as close in time as possible , reducing the effects of variations in sky transmission and emission .",
    "this sequence , however , requires many motions of the hwp , and is therefore under evaluation with a view to reducing the number of hwp motions to increase observing efficiency .",
    "data were reduced using the gemini iraf package in conjunction with starlink polpack software @xcite . the difference for each chop pair in a given nod position and hwp pa was calculated , and then differenced with the second nod position at the same hwp pa .",
    "images were aligned through shifting by fractional pixel values to account for slight image drift between frames , and then the stokes parameters i , q and u computed using polpack .",
    "a total of 20 nod positions were recorded , and residual array / electronic noise was removed through use of a median - filter noise mask .",
    "the data were reduced through creation of four individual i , q and u maps and also through coadding all frames at their respective hwp pa first and then producing a single i , q and u map .",
    "the s / n in the latter method is slightly higher in the individual q and u maps , presumably due to a smoothing of the q and u during the co - addition ; these are the data used in this paper .",
    "the efficiency and zero angle calibration of the polarimeter were measured through observations of two polarized sources and comparison with measurements published by @xcite .",
    "the instrumental polarization was estimated to be @xmath10.3% through observations of two stars that fulfilled the criteria of ( a ) high proper motion ( hence nearby ) , ( b ) high galactic latitude ( to minimize the presence of galactic dust ) and ( c ) an intermediate spectral type star ( to minimize intrinsic stellar nebulosity ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the total flux image ( color - scale and contours ) with the polarization vectors overlaid .",
    "the polarization vectors are plotted where the s@xmath12n is @xmath1354 in total flux , and contours are linearly spaced in intensity , starting at a s@xmath12n of 27 .",
    "figure 2 shows the polarized intensity map , produced by multiplying the degree of polarization by the total intensity image . as in figure 1 , only where the s / n in the total intensity image is @xmath1354 are data plotted .",
    "the resultant polarization vectors are contained within an approximate n - s oriented ellipse , major / minor axes 1.7@xmath6/1.2@xmath6 respectively .",
    "the integrated degree of polarization within that ellipse is 2.48@xmath140.57% at a pa of 26.7@xmath1415.3@xmath8 .",
    "the errors in the degree and pa of polarization are estimated through independent measurements of the four individual polarization maps and computing the standard deviation .",
    "it should be noted that the exposure time in those four individual maps was very short , where systematic effects could dominate , and hence the quoted errors may be an overestimation .",
    "the degree of polarization is higher than the 1.30% measured by @xcite in a 2  aperture , consistent with an increased observed polarization as often arises with improved spatial resolution .",
    "the pa of polarization is significantly different from lumsden s measurement of 49@xmath8 in a 2@xmath6 aperture .",
    "however , our data shows a pa rotation of 94@xmath8 from the k@xmath15 band data of @xcite and @xcite , entirely as expected if the dominant polarizing mechanism changes from dichroic absorption to emission between the two wavebands , as described in  [ intro ] .",
    "we speculate the @xcite @xmath30.68@xmath6 results suffered significantly greater contamination in their beam , possibly from surrounding extended polarization , as compared to our @xmath30.30@xmath6 results .",
    "additionally , the wider bandwidth of @xcite would have been more affected by the different and competing polarizing components .",
    "the degree and pa of polarization suggests contributions from three components .",
    "the first extends @xmath31@xmath6 north of the mid - ir peak and is coincident with the inner regions of the radio jet , with a pa of polarization approximately n - s .",
    "the second region extends south , east and west of the nucleus , with a pa of polarization of @xmath335@xmath8 .",
    "finally , the degree of polarization drops to a minimum very close to the mid - ir total flux peak , which we believe is most likely to arise from an unresolved polarization contribution with a pa of polarization approximately orthogonal to that of the more extended emission , leading to a reduction in the measured polarization .",
    "the polarized intensity image reveals polarized emission extending north of the mid - ir peak , and two areas of enhanced flux east and west of the mid - ir peak , and a minimum close to the mid - ir total flux peak .",
    "table 1 summarizes the locations and polarization components .",
    "polarization at mid - ir wavelengths most likely arises from either dichroic absorption or emission , both due to dust grains with a preferred alignment .",
    "the integrated pa of polarization in these data confirms and enhances the interpretation of the near-90@xmath8 pa flip from near- to mid - ir wavelengths , with the factor @xmath32.5 increase in spatial resolution providing a more accurate and consistent result .",
    "@xcite suggested , based on spatial coincidence , the [ oiii ] clouds in the ionization cone are the dominant mid - ir sources away from the compact torus .",
    "the polarized flux image shows a similar spatial correspondence with the [ oiii ] , and the pa of polarization north of the nucleus is consistent with the interpretation of @xcite of dichroic emission in the nlr , possibly through dust alignment via jet streaming or a helical magnetic field associated with the jet .",
    "we discount directly observed synchrotron radiation from the radio jet accounting for the polarization , as an extrapolation of the radio emission to the mid - ir provides too little flux .",
    "hence , this data confirms the extended mid - ir polarized emission north of the nucleus is dominantly from dust in the ionization cone .",
    "south , east and west of the nucleus , as the pa of polarization is perpendicular to that in the near - ir where the polarization is thought to be produced by dichroic absorption , we suggest the dominant polarizing mechanism is dichroic emission by grains aligned to the same field direction as the absorbing grains , in agreement with other authors ( i.e. @xcite ) . due to the barnett effect",
    "( @xcite , and references therein ) , grains align with their short axes parallel to the local magnetic field , and the pa of polarization is parallel to the direction of the magnetic field for dichroic absorption and orthogonal for dichroic emission .",
    "the location of the polarized emission areas and pa of polarization is suggestive of warm aligned dust grains being channeled from the host galaxy toward the torus .",
    "indeed , the pa of the polarized flux is coincident with the h@xmath5 material that @xcite associated with molecular material in a compact torus .",
    "dichroic absorption in an unresolved optically thick central region could account for the minimum in polarization close to the peak of mid - ir flux , with a pa of polarization approximately orthogonal to the more extended dichroic emission to the east , west and south .",
    "alternatively the mid - ir flux in the innermost regions could arise from a strong mid - ir , intrinsically unpolarized , source . however , there is tentative evidence of the central regions showing a twist in the pa of polarization , tending toward a similar pa found in the dichroic absorption at near - ir wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite ) , which supports the dichroic absorption interpretation . in both possibilities , a compact ( @xmath10.3@xmath6 ( @xmath122pc )",
    "diameter ) torus could account for this result .",
    "if correct , the polarization minimum indicates the true position of the central engine , which is not coincident with the mid - ir total flux peak , but displaced by @xmath30.2@xmath6 to the west .",
    "co @xcite and optical hst @xcite observations are interpreted as evidence of a warped molecular disk on 100pc scales , partially obscuring the nuclear regions of the host galaxy and ionization cone pointing away from earth . indeed ,",
    "@xcite speculate this material , rather than a compact torus , is responsible for obscuring the agn .",
    "@xcite suggest the 100pc molecular structure is the extension of the pc scale disk of masers ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that our data provide continuity between the geometrically thick torus ( height / radius @xmath31 ) to the flatter , larger galactic disk ( height / radius @xmath30.15 ) .",
    "the western polarized feature is considerably larger than the compact ( @xmath1 few pc ) torus suggested by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the basis of mid - ir imaging and modeling , but much smaller than the suggested torus detected by @xcite .",
    "however , the feature is detected in polarized flux , a technique that increases contrast by removing the dominant , unpolarized , emission .",
    "distinct from total flux , polarimetric observations are therefore potentially much more sensitive to emission from the putative faint , outer regions of the torus where the interaction with the inner regions of the host galaxy must occur .",
    "we suggest that a way to reconcile the evidence for a compact torus with these observations and others , such as extended silicate absorption ( @xcite , @xcite ) and 100 pc - scale co discs , is that the compact , geometrically and optically thick torus is often surrounded by a larger , more diffuse structure , associated with the dusty central regions of the host galaxy . where the torus ends and the host galaxy dust structure starts may be more of a question of semantics rather than a true physical boundary .",
    "these observations examine the interaction between the host galaxy and possible entrainment into the outer torus regions .",
    "further multiple - wavelength polarimetric observations of both ngc1068 and other agn are required to test this hypothesis .",
