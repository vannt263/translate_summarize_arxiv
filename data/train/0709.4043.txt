    "accordingly , collisions with granular media have long been investigated  @xcite , and like many areas of granular research , are being actively explored today in experiment  @xcite , simulation  @xcite , and theory  @xcite . however , because the physics of such events must account for both fluid- and solid - like behavior during impact , understanding remains limited .",

    "the depth is defined as the distance from the lowest point on the sphere to the initial free surface of the grains .",
    "also in ( a ) is a sketch of the instrumented projectile ( not to scale ) showing a single - axis accelerometer embedded in a sphere.,width=288 ]    recent experiments and simulations of low velocity ( below 5  m / sec ) impact with granular media have mainly considered the depth to which an object penetrates before stopping .",
    "these studies have investigated how the penetration depth scales with various system parameters .",
    "durian s group @xcite performed experiments at low collision velocities @xmath2 ( maximum penetration depth was approximately a sphere diameter ) on a variety of spheres of differing radii @xmath3 , sphere density @xmath4 , and granular particle density @xmath5 and found that the penetration depth @xmath6 scaled as @xmath7 .",
    "de  bruyn s group @xcite found a different scaling : @xmath8 .",
    "the latter experiments were conducted at larger impact velocities and with spheres of higher density such that maximum penetration depths were much greater than the sphere diameter @xmath9 . in two - dimensional ( 2d ) disk simulations , tsimring s group found that @xmath10 .",
    "phenomenological models have been proposed to account for experimental results of penetration depth from spheres impacting granular materials in a gravitational field  @xcite . in all models ,",
    "the force on a vertically falling object impacting a horizontal granular medium is written in the general form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass of the impactor , @xmath13 is the displacement of the lowest point on the object below the initial free surface of the grains , @xmath14 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath15 is the drag force due to the presence of the granular medium .",
    "impact models typically represent the drag force as the sum of two terms : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is posited to be a frictional / hydrostatic term with different proposed forms  @xcite depending on the impact regime , and impactor geometry .",
    "for example @xcite , assumes that an impacting sphere experiences hydrostatic - like forces , basing their arguments on experiments of  @xcite in which the force on a flat intruder moving at a low constant velocity increases linearly with depth below the free surface .",
    "they argue that @xmath18 for shallow impact increases as @xmath19 with @xmath20 a parameter dependent on grain properties ( e.g.  angle of repose ) , and @xmath5 . for deep impact",
    ", the free surface is assumed to move along with the sphere such that the bottom of the object is always a fixed distance @xmath21 below the local free surface ; thus @xmath18 approaches a constant with value @xmath22 .",
    "durian s group  @xcite fitted penetration depth scaling data from experiment to derive a functional form for the frictional drag in the shallow penetration regime such that , @xmath23 \\exp ( -2 |z|/d_1),\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the penetration depth for an object impacting the surface with initial collision velocity @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "these two parameters are independent of @xmath27 . similar to the model of tsimring and volfson  @xcite , eq .  [ [ dmodel ] ] also scales like @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and approaches a constant ( @xmath30 ) for sufficiently large impact depth .",
    "recently durian s group @xcite has proposed that a linear @xmath31 ( similar to the model proposed in @xcite ) provides a better fit .    to summarize ,",
    "the granular medium is modeled by a force law with a hydrodynamic drag term proportional to the square of the velocity ( which dominates at high velocity and thus deep penetration ) and a term which accounts for a depth dependent static resistance force which dominates at low speeds and thus shallow penetration depths .",
    "other studies have proposed that the drag force also includes a term linear in velocity  @xcite ; however , the experiments in @xcite are in a much higher velocity regime , 700  m / sec , than the regime examined by us and in the other studies cited here where impact velocities are typically less than 5  m / sec .    since at least 1742  @xcite various force laws for granular impact have been proposed and their associated penetration scalings discussed ; however , there have been no detailed experimental three - dimensional ( 3d ) studies of the _ forces _ that the colliding object experiences during impact .",
    "measuring and understanding the forces exerted during impact is clearly important as demonstrated by the recent and surprising experimental finding that a disk comes to rest in a time @xmath32 independent of the initial impact velocity  @xcite .",
    "fits of position versus time indicated that the acceleration during penetration was constant with magnitude dependent only upon @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , we describe here _ direct _ measurements of the forces exerted on a sphere during penetration of a granular medium .",
    "integrated force measurements show how the penetration depth scales in deep impact experiments ( our data most closely follow de  bruyn s scaling  @xcite ) while a systematic study of collision duration reveals simple scaling with system parameters .",
    "we examine key features of the dynamics using the acceleration data and then use them to guide an examination of the forces at both high and low depths and velocities . constrained by experimental force data",
    "we propose an equation to describe the forces during granular impact .",
    "finally , we show that while our new impact force equation and those referenced above account for some of the features we observe , a wealth of dynamics associated with force fluctuations remains to be understood .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] shows a sketch of the experimental apparatus .",
    "an mems ic accelerometer ( analog devices adxl150 ) with a range of @xmath33 @xmath14 s was mounted on an aluminum plug which was inserted into a hole or glued to a flat on top of the impactor ; a small diameter tube isolating the accelerometer wires from the granular medium .",
    "we note that small tube does not affect the impact dynamics because the collapsing crater does not contact the tube until well after the impactor has stopped ( see top panels of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ]  @xcite . )",
    "we choose acceleration to be positive in the direction opposite gravity .",
    "impactors were dropped into the granular medium from heights of 0.01  m to @xmath34  m with corresponding impact velocities @xmath27 ranging from 0.4 to 7  m / s .",
    "a variety of impactors and granular materials were used , see tables [ materials ] and [ impactors ] .",
    "since holes were drilled in some spheres while flats were made on others and the mass of the accelerometer is included in the indicated sphere mass , the  effective \" sphere density , @xmath4 , calculated using the masses and radii in the tables does not necessarily match the density of the material of which the sphere is composed .",
    "additionally , six 1.3  cm radius brass cylinders with different masses were mounted atop the 1.9  cm radius nylon sphere , which varied @xmath4 from 1.88 to 9.31  grams/@xmath35 .",
    "various containers were also employed ( see table  [ containers ] ) , including a 29  cm diameter by 40  cm high pvc bucket , a 25  cm diameter by 30  cm high aluminum pot , a 50  cm diameter by 75  cm high cardboard barrel , and a 10  cm diameter by 10  cm high glass jar .",
    "two different procedures were used to prepare the granular material : 1 ) the container was vigorously rocked from side to side with decreasing amplitude until the surface was level .",
    "2 ) a sieve with outer diameter approximately equal to the container was placed in the bottom of the container , the material poured in , and the sieve pulled slowly to the surface . both procedures produced reproducible dynamics .",
