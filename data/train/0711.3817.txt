    "precise measurements of absolute hadronic branching fractions for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 meson decays are important as they serve to normalize most @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays as well as many charm decays .    results from the cleo - c experiment at the cornell electron positron storage ring based on 281 pb@xmath5 recorded at the @xmath6 are presented here for studies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays .",
    "in addition , cleo - c has analyzed 298 pb@xmath5 of @xmath7 annihilation data near @xmath8 mev for studies of @xmath9 decays .",
    "these samples provide very clean environments for studying decays of @xmath10 and @xmath9 mesons .",
    "the @xmath6 , produced in the @xmath7 annihilation , decays to pairs of @xmath10 mesons , either @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , the produced @xmath10 mesons can not be accompanied by any additional pions . at @xmath8 mev",
    "@xmath9 mesons are primarily produced as @xmath13 and @xmath14 pairs .",
    "first , i will discuss the determination of the absolute hadronic @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 branching fractions .",
    "then i will present cleo - c measurements of inclusive @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 decays ; the doubly cabibbo suppressed decay @xmath18 ; studies of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ; @xmath9 decays to two pseudoscalars ; and two - body @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays to pairs of kaons .",
    "this analysis  @xcite makes use of a double tag technique initially used by mark iii  @xcite . in this technique the yields of single tags , where one @xmath10 meson is reconstructed , and double tags , where both @xmath10 mesons are reconstructed , are determined .",
    "the number of reconstructed single tags , separately for @xmath10 and @xmath21 decays , are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the efficiency and branching fraction for mode @xmath26 .",
    "similarly , the number of double tags reconstructed are given by @xmath27 where @xmath26 and @xmath28 label the @xmath10 and @xmath21 mode used to reconstruct the event and @xmath29 is the efficiency for reconstructing the final state . combining the equations above and solving for @xmath30 gives the number of produced @xmath31 events as @xmath32 and the branching fractions @xmath33 in this analysis we determine all the single tag and double tag yields in data , determine the efficiencies from monte carlo simulations of the detector response , and extract the branching fractions and @xmath31 yields from a combined fit  @xcite to all measured data yields .",
    "this analysis uses three @xmath0 decay modes ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) and six @xmath1 decay modes ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ) .",
    "the single tag yields are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dhad_st ] .",
    "the combined double tag yields are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dhad_dt ] for charged and neutral @xmath10 modes separately .",
    "the scale of the statistical errors on the branching fractions are set by the number of double tags and precisions of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are obtained for the neutral and charged modes respectively .",
    "the branching fractions obtained are summarized in table  [ tab : dhadresults ] .",
    "for the branching fractions we quote three uncertainties .",
    "the first is the statistical uncertainty , the second is the systematic uncertainties excluding the uncertainty in the modeling of final state radiation ( fsr ) , and the third error is the fsr uncertainty . for the @xmath34 mode the effect of the fsr is a 3.0% correction .",
    "we have taken the uncertainty of the fsr correction to be about 30% of the correction .",
    "this covers the difference between including or excluding the effect of interference in simulating fsr in the decay @xmath34 .            [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "i have presented results based on 281 pb@xmath5 of @xmath7 annihilation data recorded at the @xmath6 resonance for studies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays . among the results presented here",
    "were the final results for the absolute @xmath34 and @xmath37 branching fractions .",
    "cleo - c has also analyzed 298 pb@xmath5 of @xmath7 annihilation data recorded at the center - of - mass energy of 4170 mev .",
    "here we have studied the absolute hadronic branching fractions of @xmath9 mesons .",
    "cleo - c has recorded more than 800 pb@xmath5 of data at the @xmath6 and are planing to double the data sample recorded at @xmath8 mev , so there are still many interesting results to come from the cleo - c data sample .",
