    "when granular material in a rectangular container is imposed to vertical oscillation under certain conditions one observes a variety of effects , such as convection  @xcite , surface fluidization  @xcite , spontaneous heap formation  @xcite , surface patterns  @xcite , oscillons  @xcite and others .",
    "the common feature of all these effects is that particles change their position with respect to each other .",
    "provided the particles do not change their mechanical properties during observation time ( by polishing , comminution etc . ) the condition for this motion is that neighboring particles separate from each other at least for a small part of the oscillation cycle @xmath3 .",
    "there is a controversial discussion in the literature whether there is a critical value of froude number @xmath4 below which the above mentioned effects vanish , with @xmath5 and @xmath2 being the parameters of the sinusoidal motion of the container . in _",
    "many _ experimental observations  ( e.g.  @xcite ) and computer simulations ( e.g.  @xcite ) such a critical number @xmath6 was found .",
    "several authors believe that the value is @xmath1 . in numerical simulations , however , surface fluidization and convection has been found for @xmath7  @xcite . therefore , some authors believe that @xmath8 is not the proper criterion to determine the degree of fluidization of a granular system  @xcite .",
    "in this article we discuss the response of granular material with respect to vertical oscillation in the limit of an one dimensional approach : the lowest bead of a vertical column of @xmath9 identical spherical beads is shaken with @xmath10 and the other beads move due to their interaction force and gravity @xmath11 .",
    "we study the motion of the entire column and can show that particles can lose contact to their neighbors even for the case that @xmath0 is significantly less than 1 .",
    "adjacent spheres @xmath12 and @xmath13 of radius @xmath14 and mass @xmath15 at vertical positions @xmath16 and @xmath17 interact with their next neighbors by @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 being elastic and dissipative material constants , i.e. functions of young modulus , poisson ratio and dissipation rate ( for details of the derivation of eq .",

    "we define the `` response '' @xmath31 as the ratio @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the amplitude of the @xmath9-th particle at frequency @xmath2 and @xmath5 is the amplitude of the driving vibration .",
    "@xmath31 can be calculated by convoluting the motion @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "suppose @xmath36 the @xmath9-th particle separates from the @xmath37-st .",
    "if we would find @xmath38 the critical froude number @xmath39 would be less than 1 .",
    "we will show that there is a range for @xmath2 where this is the case .    in the next section we will formulate the problem in a continuum approach and derive a nonlinear partial differential equation for the motion of the column of particles .",
    "this equation is solved in section [ sec : elastic ] in the limit of elastic material properties , i.e. by dropping the dissipative terms .",
    "once the solution for the elastic case has been discussed in detail , it is easier to study the influence of the dissipative term and to derive the solution of the full equation of motion which is done in section [ sec : full ] .",
    "section [ sec : numeric ] compares the analytic results with a molecular dynamics simulation of the original ( discrete ) problem stated in eq .",
    "( [ diskret ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the results .",
    "to study the system analytically we use an one dimensional continuum approach . to this end",
    "we perform a taylor expansion of the force with respect to the radius @xmath14 and consequently consider the limit @xmath40 , @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",

    "gets @xmath68 the solution of the spatial equation ( [ eq : xxx ] ) can be found using the ansatz @xmath69 which yields @xmath70 eq .",
    "( [ bessel ] ) is the bessel equation of order @xmath71 .",
    "hence the solution of ( [ eq : xxx ] ) is @xmath72 an expression containing @xmath73 would be a solution too , however , it does not satisfy the condition ( [ boundary ] ) .",
    "the prefactor in ( [ bessel.ort ] ) has been chosen to assure @xmath74 .",
    "hence the solution for a single vibrational mode @xmath75 is @xmath76    without prior knowledge the full solution of eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) has to be assumed to be a superposition of vibrational modes for all real ( rescaled ) frequencies @xmath66 : @xmath77 in the steady state of pure sinusoidal excitation of the base , i.e. , when all non - oscillatory perturbations which originate from the initialization have been damped out , eq . ( [ eq:13 ] ) is the full ( steady state- ) solution of eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath78 represents the excitation of the mode at frequency @xmath66 .",
    "the boundary condition at the top of the chain is automatically satisfied , whereas the boundary condition at the bottom reads @xmath79 one can see that the integrand of eq .",
    "( [ eq : enforce_bc1 ] ) can be nonzero only for @xmath80 .",
    "this means that for @xmath80 either @xmath78 or @xmath81 have to be zero , i.e. for all frequencies for which @xmath81 is nonzero the respective amplitude must be zero , whereas for all frequencies which are a root of @xmath82 the amplitude can be nonzero .",
    "therefore , we find that the full solution of eq .",
    "( [ wave ] ) is a superposition of the vibrational mode of the frequency of shaking @xmath83 and of a discrete set of frequencies @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "note that @xmath84 are no rational multiples of each others since the roots of bessel - functions are incommensurable ( see eq .",
    "( [ bessel.ort ] ) ) . therefore , to determine the maximum acceleration of the topmost particle it is sufficient to consider only the mode of the external excitation .",
    "all other vibrational modes can only further increase the maximal acceleration .",
    "the above defined response @xmath86 is the ratio @xmath32 . since the zeroth particle corresponds to @xmath87 and the n - th to @xmath88",
    "we can write @xmath89 the response @xmath86 is an amplification factor , hence , the value @xmath90 is the critical acceleration of the driving vibration @xcite .",
    "@xmath86 is larger than 1 for all driving frequencies @xmath2 .",
    "this means that for _ any _ driving frequency @xmath2 and driving amplitude @xmath5 the amplitude of the top particle of the column @xmath33 at frequency @xmath2 will be larger than @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath91 , i.e. when the @xmath9-th particle separates from the @xmath37-st , we find @xmath92 .",
    "according to the above arguments we have to replace the condition @xmath93 which was supposed to be the precondition for surface fluidization , convection etc .",
    ", by @xmath94    the function @xmath95 over @xmath2 is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : response ] ( dash - dotted line , @xmath96 ) . for the system parameters we used @xmath97 , elastic constant @xmath98 ( rubber with young modulus @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 .",
    "the curve reveals pronounced resonances at eigenfrequencies @xmath101 where @xmath102 becomes minimal ( only the first resonance is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : response ] ) .",
    "all experiments on surface fluidization and convection which can be found in literature have been performed far below the first resonance .",
    "therefore , of particular interest to practical purposes is the limit of small frequency @xmath2 , i.e. below the first eigenfrequency .",
    "the taylor expansion of eq .",
    "( [ response ] ) yields @xmath103 for small @xmath83 @xmath104    given the container vibrates with frequency @xmath2 .",
    "then for the critical amplitude @xmath5 of the vibration when the top particle separates , i.e. when the material starts to fluidize , one finds @xmath105    [ fig : response ]    surprisingly even for very small frequencies where @xmath106 one finds that the critical amplitude is reduced by a constant as compared with @xmath107 .",
    "so although the value of the response function comes arbitrarily close to one , the critical _ amplitude _ differs from the expected one by a constant .",
    "however , this does not mean that the critical froude number becomes a constant .",
    "( [ bessel.ort ] ) describes the behavior of the column of grains for the case of purely elastic contact ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "if the dissipative material properties are taken into consideration the full equation ( [ elastic ] ) has to be solved which will be discussed in the following section .",
    "we will consider , as before , small perturbations @xmath109 about the static deformation of the chain under gravity which propagate from the bottom .",
    "the dissipative term is characterized by the parameter @xmath110 in eq .",
    "( [ elastic ] ) . from this equation , again introducing the static solution given by eq .",

    "( [ eq : xxx ] ) .",
    "hence the same transformations apply in this case and the general solution reads finally @xmath117.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the part of the solution depending on @xmath73 carries a divergence at @xmath88 ( @xmath118 ) , and therefore @xmath119 is required for the solution to be physical .",
    "the condition of the free end at @xmath88 ( @xmath118 ) is satisfied automatically , as in the case @xmath120 .",
    "the solution has exactly the same structure as the solution of the elastic problem , eq .",
    "( [ bessel.ort ] ) , and the only change is that the argument of the bessel function has an imaginary part .",
    "if one considers only the mode @xmath2 , which propagates from the bottom ( @xmath87 ) with amplitude @xmath5 , the solution reads @xmath121    the fluidization condition at the top of the chain @xmath122 can be written in general @xmath123 since the bessel functions of the first class only have zeros on the real axis , @xmath95 can no longer be zero for any frequency if @xmath124 .",
    "this means that the sharp resonances displayed by @xmath31 when @xmath53 disappear and are replaced by more or less pronounced minima in dependence on the damping constant @xmath110 .",
    "this can also be observed in figure [ fig : response ] ( full line ) .",
    "increasing values of @xmath110 make the response smoother , deviating from that of the elastic case earlier , and the local minima translate on the frequency axis appreciably , see figure [ fig : damping ] .",
    "analogue to the elastic case ( eq .  ( [ taylor.elas ] ) ) , for small frequencies @xmath95 can be expanded into a taylor series : @xmath125 the contribution due to the dissipative parameter enters the taylor expansion at the fourth power of the frequency . therefore , the analysis of the elastic case given by eq .",
    "( [ taylor.elas ] ) remains valid for small frequencies .",
    "it is interesting to note that due to eq .",
    "( [ taylor.diss ] ) there _ always _ exists a global minimum below the value @xmath126 , regardless of the value of the dissipative parameter .",
    "we want to study for which range of frequencies the inverse response @xmath102 is smaller than one for varying damping constant @xmath110 : the lower boundary of this interval obviously is @xmath127 . to determine the upper boundary @xmath128 we solved numerically the equation @xmath129 for different values of @xmath110 .",
    "the result of this calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega1 ] .",
    "one can see that for high enough damping this frequency @xmath130 varies only slowly with @xmath110 .",
    "the curve almost saturates at @xmath131 which is close to the first maximum of the undamped inverse response ( see fig . [",
    "fig : steps ] , dash - dotted line ) . although the valley of the inverse response function becomes smaller with increasing damping ( fig .",
    "[ fig : omega1 ] ) , even for larger damping @xmath102 is smaller than one in a finite frequency interval , i.e. the effect of amplitude amplification exists for almost the entire range of frequencies between zero and the first maximum of the undamped inverse response .",
    "for small enough damping the frequency range of amplitude amplification @xmath132 extends beyond the position of the first maximum of the undamped inverse response .",
    "figure [ fig : steps ] shows the response function for different dissipative parameter @xmath110 together with the elastic case ( @xmath53 , dash - dotted ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath2 at which @xmath133 increases with decreasing damping . in this fig .",
    "[ fig : steps ] one can clearly see the extension of the range of amplitude amplification . if we decrease the damping parameter , starting at high values where the amplifying range is limited to the first `` well '' we can not expect a large change since , as long as we remain limited to the first well , there is a upper bound ( the frequency of the first maximum of @xmath102 ) to this range . reducing @xmath110 further we will eventually reach values for which the amplifying range extends to the second well . even for values of @xmath110 which are only slightly below this threshold",
    "the range will now span again almost the entire range of the second well up to the frequency of the second maximum .",
    "so there will be rather sharp steps in the dependence of the upper range limit of the damping instead of only gradual changes .",
    "this behaviour explains the steps in the closeup of fig .",
    "[ fig : omega1 ] .",
    "to check the analytical results and in particular the validity of the continuum approach we calculated @xmath102 for a finite value of damping @xmath110 from the numerical simulation of eq .",

    "[ fig : response ] shows that for small frequency @xmath2 and small damping @xmath20 the undamped theoretical curve ( dash - dotted ) agrees well with numerical data . if one compares the numerical result with the damped solution according to eq .",
    "( [ rofbeta ] ) ( full line in fig .",
    "[ fig : response ] ) the agreement with theory is very well .    to check the validity of our linear theory we also determined directly by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqnofmotion ] ) at which froude number @xmath6 the particles start to jump .",
    "the results of this calculation are shown in the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : response ] and agree well with the linear theory . to obtain the value of @xmath6 for a given frequency @xmath2 we determined an upper bound @xmath136 for the critical amplitude where one observes jumping and a lower bound @xmath137 where no jumping occurs .",
    "then we narrowed the interval @xmath138 by testing an amplitude between @xmath136 and @xmath137 until @xmath139 .",
    "for the case of a vertical column of viscoelastic spheres we derived a linear wave equation in one dimensional approximation .",
    "we have shown that the sphere on top of the column @xmath9 can separate from the @xmath37-st even if the container is oscillated with @xmath140 . as main result",
    "we derived a modified condition for the topmost particle to separate from its neighbor .",
    "we could show that instead of the widely accepted condition @xmath141 one has to satisfy @xmath142 where @xmath102 is a function of @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that independent on the material properties there exists _ always _ a range @xmath143 $ ] for which the amplitude of vibration @xmath5 is amplified , i.e. for which the top particle can separate ( the material fluidizes ) even if @xmath144 .",
    "numerical calculations agree well with the analytic results .    whereas the critical froude number @xmath145 is certainly the proper criterion to predict whether a single rigid particle will jump on a vibrating table",
    ", we suspect that this number is not suited to describe the behavior of a vibrated column of spheres , and the more it is not a criterion for surface fluidization of a three dimensional granular material .",
