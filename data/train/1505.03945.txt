    "high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates , such as la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco ) and yba@xmath9cu@xmath12o@xmath13 ( ybco ) , appears in the characteristic regime between the insulating antiferromagnetic and overdoped metallic regimes .",
    "considering that the magnetic fluctuations play an important role in the superconductivity of these compounds , describing the dynamical magnetic response in the superconducting regime is an important issue .",
    "it is well understood that the magnetic excitations in undoped la@xmath9cuo@xmath3 ( lco ) can be described by the spin - wave theory with nearest - neighbor , next - nearest - neighbor , and cycle - exchange terms .",
    "@xcite in contrast , neutron scattering experiments have revealed a characteristic magnetic excitation in the superconducting regime  @xcite : an incommensurate magnetic signal apparently disperses inward below a certain energy , @xmath14 , and then disperses outward above @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite this excitation , called an `` hour - glass '' excitation , is observed in a wide doping range of lsco from non - superconducting @xmath15 ( ref .  ) to slightly overdoped @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite in the underdoped region , the low - energy incommensurability and @xmath14 increase linearly with doping .",
    "@xcite the low - energy incommensurate spin fluctuation appears up to the overdoped region ; however , its cross section decreases linearly with superconducting transition temperature @xmath17 as the superconductivity decreases with overdoping .",
    "@xcite these facts suggest that the hole doping strongly affects the low - energy magnetic excitations and that they are closely related to the superconductivity .",
    "an alternative to neutron inelastic scattering for the observation of single magnons is provided by the recently developed resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) technique at the cu-@xmath0 edge .",
    "@xcite in contrast to rixs with the cu-@xmath18 edge , which is more sensitive to charge excitations triggered by the core - hole potential in the 1@xmath19 orbital , rixs with the cu-@xmath0 edge can trigger a single magnon excitation by the spin - orbit coupling of 2@xmath20 orbitals .",
    "@xcite a systematic study of paramagnons by this technique using the hole - doped ybco  @xcite and lsco  @xcite family compounds revealed that the dispersion relation along the @xmath10 direction above 150  mev is nearly independent of the hole concentration in a wide doping range from the undoped to the non - superconducting overdoped samples .",
    "this fact is in sharp contrast to the neutron results in the low - energy region .        because of the limited wave vector of incident photons at the cu-@xmath0 edge and relatively relaxed energy resolution of 120  mev , compared with neutron inelastic scattering , rixs at the cu-@xmath0 edge is more appropriate for the measurement of magnon excitations above 100  mev dispersing from the @xmath21 position , where the magnetic structure factor for neutron scattering is small .",
    "in contrast , neutron scattering has a fine energy resolution , typically a few mev , which makes it difficult to observe high - energy magnetic excitation in doped samples , which is broad in energy , and consequently , neutron inelastic scattering is suitable for the observation of magnetic excitations below 150 mev , dispersing from the antiferromagnetic ( af ) zone center @xmath8 for the doped samples .",
    "thus , rixs and neutron inelastic scattering measurements are complementary to each other .    in this paper , we report high - energy magnetic excitations above 100 mev of overdoped lsco studied by both neutron inelastic scattering and cu-@xmath0 edge rixs using identical crystals for the two techniques .",
    "the overdoped sample was selected such that we can also test the doping independence of the paramagnon dispersion relation .",
    "the neutron scattering results of lsco @xmath4 indicate that the magnetic dispersion relation along the @xmath8 direction up to 250 mev reasonably agrees with the spin - wave dispersion relation of lco , which is consistent with the doping - independence of magnetic dispersion reported using rixs .",
    "the cu-@xmath0 edge rixs measurements of the identical sample reveal that the dispersion along the @xmath10 direction is consistent with the lco spin - wave dispersion and previous rixs results by dean _",

    "@xcite using lsco thin films .",
    "in contrast , the paramagnon near @xmath11 appears to be less dispersive and the excitation energy near @xmath11 is lower than the spin - wave energy of lco .",
    "single crystals of lsco with @xmath4 and @xmath22 used for the neutron and cu-@xmath0 rixs measurements were grown using the traveling solvent floating zone method .",
    "the growth and post - annealing conditions are the same as those described in ref .  .",
    "single crystals of @xmath4 were used for the neutron measurements , and both @xmath4 and @xmath22 were used for the neutron inelastic scattering and rixs .",
    "the crystal structures of @xmath4 and @xmath6 are tetragonal with space group @xmath23 . in the present study ,",
    "we use the notation based on this tetragonal structure .",
    "therefore , the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath8 corresponds to @xmath24 .",
    "neutron scattering experiments were performed using the sequoia chopper spectrometer  @xcite at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) at oak ridge national laboratory ( ornl ) .",
    "five single crystals of @xmath4 , with volumes of @xmath25  @xmath26 , were co - aligned using a neutron diffractometer installed at the cg-1b beam port of the high flux isotope reactor ( hfir ) at ornl before the sequoia measurements .",

    "these experimental conditions provides an energy resolution of 5  20  mev , and an momentum resolution of approximately @xmath32  @xmath33 along the @xmath8 direction for the energy transfer between 100  250  mev .",
