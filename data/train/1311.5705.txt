    "denote by @xmath7 an oriented surface of genus @xmath8 with @xmath9 boundary components and @xmath10 punctures and by @xmath11 its mapping class group , that is the group of isotopy classes of orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath7 that are the identity on the boundary and fix the punctures .",
    "also denote by @xmath12 the mod @xmath13 reduction of @xmath14 . in a famous paper @xcite harer computed the second homology group of mapping class group for @xmath15 .",
    "then , using a presentation of @xmath16 given by wajnryb in @xcite we showed in @xcite that harer s computations could be obtained from hopf s formula and extended to @xmath17 , yielding moreover an explicit generator for this group .",
    "later on in @xcite korkmaz and stipsicz pushed this computations to encompass the remaining genus @xmath18 and @xmath19 . notice that for @xmath20 benson and cohen had computed the poincar series of @xmath21 .",
    "unfortunately a small gap remained after korkmaz and stipsicz computations : they showed that @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 .",
    "the purpose of this note is to close this gap and to finally prove :    we have @xmath25 and @xmath26    as observed by korkmaz and stipsicz the computations using hopf s formula show that the homomorphism induced by capping - off the boundary component @xmath27 is surjective and hence , from our computation , an isomorphism .",
    "denote by @xmath28 or @xmath29 accordingly the torelli groups , that is the kernel of the surjective map from the mapping class group onto the symplectic group with integer entries @xmath30 . by computations of stein @xcite",
    "we know that @xmath31 .",
    "since mapping class groups of genus @xmath32 are perfect , the @xmath33 term exact sequence in low dimensional homology gives a small exact sequence : @xmath34 & h_2(\\mathrm{sp}(6;\\mathbf{z});\\mathbf{z } ) \\ar[r ] & ( h_1(\\mathcal{t}_\\ast;\\mathbf{z}))_{\\mathrm{sp}(6;\\mathbf{z } ) } \\ar[r ] & 0   } \\ ] ] where @xmath35 denotes either @xmath8 or @xmath36 and in view of stein s result all we have to do is to show that @xmath37 = 0 $ ] .    by johnson s fundamental result",
    "the torelli group @xmath28 and @xmath29 are generated by twists along bounding pairs of genus @xmath38 , that is by mapping classes of the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are two simple closed curves that are not isotopic , homologous , not homologous to @xmath42 and such that the complement of @xmath43 has a component of genus @xmath38 .",
    "in particular capping - off the boundary component induces a surjective map @xmath44 and since taking coinvariants is a right - exact functor it is enough to prove that @xmath45 = 0.\\ ] ]    the mapping class group acts transitively on bounding pairs of genus @xmath38 , hence the group @xmath46 $ ] is monogenic generated by the class of any bounding pair map .",
    "also , given a bounding pair @xmath43 there exists a mapping class , say @xmath47 , that exchanges @xmath40 and @xmath41 , hence in @xmath46 $ ] : @xmath48 and @xmath49 $ ] is at most @xmath12 .",
    "in @xcite johnson computed the abelianization of the torelli group @xmath50 , it fits into a short exact sequence : @xmath51 & b^2_{3,1 } \\ar[r ] & h_1(\\mathcal{t}_{g,1 } ; \\mathbf{z } ) \\ar[r ] & \\lambda^3 h \\ar[r ] & 0 ,   } \\ ] ] where :    1 .",
    "@xmath52 stands for the homology group @xmath53 , 2 .",
    "@xmath54 is the boolean algebra of polynomials of degree @xmath55 generated by the elements @xmath56 and subject to the relations : * @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the mod @xmath13 intersection number , * @xmath59 .",
    "notice that this is a short exact sequence of @xmath60-modules , where the action on the quotient is simply given by the third exterior power of the action on homology and the action of the kernel is given on generators by @xmath61 extended in the obvious way .",
    "finally , this kernel is a @xmath12-vector space and is the image in @xmath62 of the johnson subgroup @xmath63 , the subgroup generated by twists along bounding simple closed curves .",
    "this image is a quotient of @xmath65 , so it suffices to prove that this group is trivial .",
    "first notice that since the mod @xmath13 symplectic form is non - degenerated any non - zero element in @xmath52 can be completed into a symplectic basis , and in particular @xmath60 acts transitively on the non - zero elements in @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath66 be two elements such that @xmath67 , then if @xmath68 denotes the transvection along @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 , and in @xmath65 this gives that @xmath71 , hence in @xmath65 all monomials of degree @xmath38 or @xmath13 are in fact constants and this group is at most @xmath12 .",
    "finally , let @xmath72 be such that @xmath73 .",
    "in @xmath65 we have : @xmath74        the lantern relation shows that the twist around @xmath75 , a bounding simple closed curve of genus @xmath13 can be written as the product of three twists around bounding pairs of genus @xmath38 : @xmath76 if @xmath77 denotes the generator of @xmath64 , which is of order @xmath13 , then this equation becomes @xmath78 , and this finishes the proof ."
