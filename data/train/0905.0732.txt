    "the two basic steps in bacterial infection are the initial injection of the viral dna into a bacteriophage capsid @xcite and then the ejection of the dna into a host cell @xcite . the processes underlying these two steps are both phenomenologically rich and incompletely understood .",
    "in packaging dna into a capsid , both the strong repulsion from the bending of the dna and the stress caused by the capsid being smaller than the persistence length have to be overcome .",
    "the pressure associated with this capsid packaging can be in the range of tens of atmospheres @xcite .",
    "these forces that repel the polymer during packaging are overcome by a specifically - designed motor protein @xcite .",
    "the complementary ejection of the dna into the host cell through small pores in the capsid is driven by the osmotic pressure exerted by the capsid and the internal stresses that have been built up in the highly - confined dna polymer chain @xcite .",
    "because of its central importance in the life cycle of viruses , dna ejection from a capsid has been intensively studied @xcite .",
    "most theoretical treatments have investigated the role of microscopic mechanisms that arise naturally from the combined effects of osmotic pressure and bending energy .",
    "recent experiments and simulations suggest that viral dna may become knotted ( _ i.e. _ , a closed chain with a knot can not be smoothly deformed into a circle ) as it is being tightly packed in the capsid @xcite .",
    "these knots are apparently large enough to prevent the dna from being completely ejected being from the capsid @xcite .",
    "if this steric hindrance is fully operative , then knots would have to unravel for complete ejection . because the driving forces are pushing the chain out of the capsid ,",
    "the only way for complete ejection to occur is for the knot to reptate along the chain and ultimately unravel when the end of the chain is reached .",
    "this mechanism and its role on polymer ejection has recently been explored by numerical simulation of a bead - spring model of a flexible polymer together with a coupling to a background solvent @xcite .",
    "this study provides detailed , but nevertheless still qualitative results , for the time dependence of the fraction of the chain that remains within the capsid , as well as the dependence of the ejection time on the number and type of knots on the polymer .    in this work",
    ", we propose a coarse - grained model to capture the role of knots on the ejection process ( fig .",
    "[ fig : illust ] ) . in this model ,",
    "the reptation of knots is described by the symmetric exclusion process @xcite , while the point at the interface between in the interior and exterior of the capsid undergoes a biased motion and also satisfies the exclusion constraint .",
    "we may view this biased particle as a `` shepherd '' that pushes the knots ( `` sheep '' ) to the end of the chain where they can unravel .",
    "once all the knots have unraveled , the polymer can be completely ejected .    in the next section",
    ", we present the details of this shepherding model . in sec .",
    "[ discrete ] , we treat the ejection of a polymer chain with a small number of knots . for this discrete system ,",
    "we write and solve the master equations that describe the position of the knots along the chain .",
    "this solution gives the exact result that the velocity of a strongly - biased shepherd equals @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the number of knots .",
    "an unexpected and simplifying feature of the strongly - biased limit is that the velocity and diffusion coefficient of the shepherd do not depend on microscopic rates .",
    "we also establish a mapping to the solvable zero range process @xcite , and we use this mapping to obtain further exact results for the diffusion of the shepherd .",
    "finally , we investigate a semi - infinite system with a finite density of knots ( sec .",
    "[ cont ] ) . here",
    "we apply a continuum approach to solve for the knot density profile , from which the displacement of the shepherd grows as @xmath2 , with a calculable amplitude @xmath3 .",
    "to present our model , it is convenient to employ a reference frame that is fixed along the length of the polymer .",
    "the chain can be divided into a portion that has been ejected from the capsid and the portion that remains in the interior .",
    "the basic feature of our modeling is that ejection may be hindered by the existence of knots along the portion of the polymer that is still inside the capsid .",
    "we assume that these knots are sufficiently large that they can not pass through the pore in the capsid @xcite . because of this restriction",
    ", some other relaxation mechanism is needed to allow for complete ejection of a polymer .    )",
    "is biased to the right , while the knots ( @xmath4 ) are represented as localized particles that hop symmetrically on the integer interval @xmath5 $ ] . upon reaching the end of the chain",
    ", the knot has unraveled ; this event is represented as an absorbing boundary at @xmath6 .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one such mechanism is provided by the possibility that knots are not static but move along the polymer chain by reptation @xcite .",
    "when a knot reptates to the free end of the polymer , it disappears because the entanglement of the knot is released .",
    "if the chain contains multiple knots , then we assume that they can not pass through each other ; instead they must individually reptate to the end of the chain and unravel in sequence .",
    "our main focus is the position of the point that separates the ejected portion of the polymer from the portion inside .",
    "we model the position of this dividing point by an effective particle ( a `` shepherd '' ) that undergoes biased diffusion along the chain , with rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 to the left and right , respectively .",
    "the bias of the shepherd corresponds to the polymer being pushed out of the capsid by osmotic pressure and the release of bending energy .",
    "the shepherd therefore rectifies the diffusive motion of the knots so that the polymer will be ejected .",
    "when the shepherd reaches the right end of the polymer , the ejection is complete . in the spirit of minimalism",
    ", we assume that this bias is constant throughout the ejection process ; in reality the bias will decrease with time as the ejection of the polymer relaxes the stresses that drives the ejection .",
    "we assume that the chain initially contains a specified number of knots that are randomly interspersed along the chain .",
    "the ejected portion is necessarily free of knots , while the complementary portion of the chain remains knotted ( except possibly near the very end of the ejection process ) . in the spirit of a coarse - grained model",
    ", we ignore the topology of the knots and replace them by localized defects .",
    "each defect can move equally likely in both direction along the chain due to thermal noise , and hence the reptation of the knot is modeled as a symmetric random walk .",
    "different type of knots could be described by different diffusion coefficients , however , we restrict our discussion to a single type of knot , where all knots have the same hopping rates .",
    "in addition to the random motion of the knots , there is also an exclusion constraint because knots can not pass through each other or pass by the shepherd ( corresponding to the disallowed event of a knot passing through the capsid pore ) .",
    "the knots can be viewed as a flock of diffusing and mutually repelling excitations that are pushed to the end of the interval by an advancing shepherd . when each knot reaches the right end of the chain it simply disappears , corresponding to an absorbing boundary condition . when the shepherd reaches the end of the chain ( fig .",
    "[ fig : illust ] ) , the polymer has been completely ejected .",
    "because of its bias , the shepherd rectifies the diffusive motion of the knots .",
    "this rectification of thermal noise underlies many microscopic biological processes , such as the motion of motor proteins @xcite , and the chaperon assisted translocation of polymers across a membrane @xcite . in our model of polymer ejection ,",
    "the rectification is mediated by the exclusion constraint of the knots , leading to an exclusion process in which a single particle is subject to a bias that acts indirectly on all other particles .",
    "a two - sided version of this model with a biased particle caged in between unbiased particles has been studied previously @xcite ; this model mimics , _ e.g. _ , the field - driven motion of a charged particle that is immersed in a lattice gas of neutral particles .",
    "it is worth mentioning that various embellishments of idealized exclusion processes have helped to understand a variety of biological processes and have raised new theoretical questions about the exclusion process itself @xcite .",
    "we first study the case of a small number of knots by writing the discrete master equations that describe the probability distribution for their positions .",
    "these master equations turn out to be soluble , from which we can extract the speed of the shepherd in the steady state .      to determine the ejection speed of a polymer that contains a single knot , note that before the shepherd first reaches the knot , its speed is simply @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ xt ] , left ) .",
    "subsequently , the knot and the shepherd stay close to each other because of the bias of the shepherd toward the knot . as a result , the speed of their mutual advance is less than @xmath10 . to obtain this speed ,",
    "we define @xmath11 as the probability that the number of empty sites between the shepherd and the first knot is @xmath12 .",
    "we call this number of vacancies between the two particles as the `` gap '' . for gap size @xmath13 , @xmath12 can increase to @xmath14 with rate @xmath15 , either by the knot hopping one step to the right or the shepherd hopping one step to the left with rate @xmath7 , respectively . similarly , for @xmath16 , the gap size @xmath12 decreases to @xmath17 with rate @xmath18 . when @xmath19 , the gap size can only increase with rate @xmath15 .     and @xmath20 , respectively .",

    "a useful feature of our model is that it can be mapped onto the _ zero range process _",
    "( zrp ) @xcite on a chain of @xmath0 sites with open boundaries . in this mapping",
    ", each knot corresponds to a site in the zrp , and the number @xmath43 of empty sites to the left of each knot corresponds to the number of particles that occupy site @xmath40 in the zrp .",
    "the particles in the zrp multiply occupy each site , and only the top particle can hop at a rate that is independent of the occupancy of the target site .",
    "for example ,",
    "knot @xmath40 hopping to the right corresponds to a particle in the zrp hopping from site @xmath75 to @xmath40 .",
    "the top particle in this corresponding zrp can hop : ( i ) both to the left and to the right at rate 1 from each bulk site ; ( ii ) out of site @xmath76 at rate @xmath77 and into @xmath76 at rate @xmath7 ; ( iii ) either in or out of site @xmath78 at rate 1 .",
    "the relevant feature of this mapping is that the negative of the current entering the zrp from the left exactly corresponds to the speed of the shepherd .",
    "our shepherd model is a special case of the general zrp that was solved by @xcite and eqs .  , , and",

    "in addition to its average speed , we are also interested in the diffusion coefficient of the shepherd . due to the equivalence of the models",

    "for concreteness , consider a polymer of length @xmath6 , with a shepherd at site 0 , and @xmath0 equidistant knots initially at @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "if the knot density @xmath87 is sufficiently low ( roughly if @xmath88 ) , the biased shepherd reaches each knot close to the knot s initial position .",

    "when a real virus is ejected from the capsid , the pressure should decrease during this process @xcite .",
    "this effect can be modeled as a decreasing bias @xmath77 for the shepherd .",
    "since the bias is so enormous in the capsid @xcite , even the decreased bias can be considered as large bias in our model .",
    "this argument is supported by the fairly uniform rate of virus ejection in simulations of @xcite .",
    "the ejection time for large bias becomes @xmath97 , that is independent of the rates @xmath7 and @xmath77 .",
    "knowing this ejection time experimentally would give us an estimate for the hopping rates of the knots , ( which we used to rescale time with ) .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know of such experiments .",
    "when the number of knots is large , it is more convenient to study the knot density profile by a continuum theory .",
    "while a finite knot density is perhaps not of direct relevance to the polymer ejection problem , this limiting situation leads to an appealing exclusion process that can be solved in a simple way by applying a scaling approach to account for the effective moving boundary condition caused by the motion of the shepherd @xcite .",
    "let @xmath98 denote the continuum knot density at position @xmath99 and time @xmath100 , and let @xmath101 denote the position of the shepherd ( fig .",
    "[ continuum ] ) .",
    "initially the shepherd is at @xmath102 and it hops to the right with rate 1 whenever its right neighbor is vacant . in the continuum limit , the knot density @xmath98 satisfies the diffusion equation @xmath103 the diffusion coefficient @xmath104 since the hopping rate of each knot equals 1 and the exclusion plays no role in the overall density when the hopping is symmetric @xcite .",
    "as the shepherd advances , knots accumulate in front of it and the knot density increases monotonically from a value @xmath105 as @xmath106 to the value 1 at @xmath107 .",
    "the shepherd advances only when the adjacent site is empty . in the continuum limit ,",
    "the analog of this advancement rule is @xmath108 that is , the probability that there is a gap in front of the shepherd equals the local knot density gradient .",
    "thus we must solve the diffusion equation in the region @xmath109 subject to the initial condition @xmath110 and the boundary condition @xmath111 .",

    "we modeled the ejection of a knotted flexible polymer from a capsid in terms of a hybrid dynamical model that consists of a single asymmetric exclusion process ( representing the boundary point on the polymer between the interior and exterior of the capsid ) that interacts with a gas of symmetric exclusion processes ( the knots ) . in the absence of any external forces , the knots reptate symmetrically along the chain .",
    "the effect of the osmotic pressure is modeled as the single asymmetric exclusion process that shepherds the knots to the opposite end of the chain where their entanglement is released . once all the knots have unraveled , the polymer can be ejected .",
    "the ejection speed @xmath126 can be solved exactly for the @xmath127-particle system that consists of the shepherd and @xmath0 knots and the result is remarkably simple for a strongly - biased shepherd : @xmath74 .",
    "the underlying exclusion process can also be solved for a finite density of knots by a continuum description . here",
    "the amount of the chain that is ejected at time @xmath100 is not proportional to @xmath100 , but rather to @xmath128 .",
    "this behavior matches that of the discrete solution in the limit of a strongly - biased shepherd . in all of our theoretical modeling ,",
    "we use constant bias throughout the entire ejection process .",
    "we argue that the motion remains in the strong - bias regime throughout the ejection process due to the extremely large initial pressure in the capsid .",
    "as long as the system remains in this strong - bias limit , the motion of the shepherd and the knots are not influenced by the decrease in the ejection force and it is appropriate to treat the bias as constant .",
    "one final point is that we have assumed that all knots are identical",
    ". it may be worthwhile to extend our model to the physical more realistic case where knots are non - identical , so that their diffusivities are random variables .",
