    "dust and stars in the plane of the milky way create a zone of avoidance ( zoa ) in the extra - galactic sky .",
    "as such our galaxy is a natural barrier severely constraining studies of the large scale structures in the universe , the peculiar motion of the local group and other streaming motions which are important for understanding formation processes in the early universe and for cosmological models .    in the southern milky way , the great attractor ( ga ) area is a region of special interest in this respect .",
    "apparent as a large - scale systematic flow of galaxies towards @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ( kolatt et al .",
    "1995 ) , this predicted mass excess is largely obscured from our view . though it is generally believed to be an extended region ( @xmath2 ) of moderately enhanced density ( lynden - bell 1991 , hudson 1994 or kolatt et al .",
    "1995 , cf .",
    "their fig .",
    "3b ) , no counterpart for the centre of its gravitational potential could be identified .    in an effort to reduce the size of the zoa",
    ", we have been engaged for some years now in a deep optical galaxy search in the southern milky way : @xmath3 ( see kraan - korteweg 1989 and kraan - korteweg & woudt 1994a for details on the galaxy search ) .",
    "this recently led to the recognition that the cluster aco 3627 is a very massive , nearby cluster of galaxies at the core of the ga @xmath4 km s@xmath1 ( kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "1996a ) , emphasizing therewith that gravitationally influential constituents of the local universe are indeed hidden by the milky way  their appearance inconspicuous due to the obscuring veil of the galaxy .",
    "we here present an `` all - sky distribution '' of the optically detected galaxies in the southern hemisphere , and a discussion of aco 3627 and its role within the known extra - galactic structures .",
    "one of the prime objectives of our deep optical galaxy search behind the southern milky way , or other galaxy surveys in the zoa , is the derivation of a uniform whole - sky distribution of galaxies , i.e. as would have been seen in the absence of the obscuring layers of the milky way ( lynden - bell 1994 ) .",
    "11.3 cm    as a first step in obtaining an all - sky distribution of galaxies in the southern sky , we have corrected the diameters of our newly found galaxies for the diminishing effects of the extinction using cameron s ( 1990 ) law , the hi - column densities ( kerr et al .  1986 ) as a tracer of the dust distribution and the formalism of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) , assuming a constant gas - to - dust ratio . from the 10276 galaxies found to date with @xmath5@xmath6 , 1949",
    "galaxies would have appeared in the lauberts catalogue ( lauberts 1982 , @xmath7@xmath8 ) were it not for the milky way . of those 1949 galaxies ,",
    "only 258 had been previously catalogued by lauberts .",
    "the combined distribution of all the galaxies with @xmath7@xmath8 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the contours drawn in figure 1 are deduced from the hi - column densities .",
    "the outer contour ( @xmath9@xmath6 ) corresponds to an apparent diameter reduction for spiral galaxies of @xmath10 ( cameron 1990 ) and demarcates our completeness limit : below this line a galaxy with @xmath11@xmath8 would be smaller than our diameter limit and therefore go unnoticed . above this band",
    "distinct concentrations and filaments can be recognized .",
    "the inner contour ( @xmath12@xmath8 ) shows the remaining zoa . below this contour",
    "the milky way remains opaque .",
    "the most prominent concentration of galaxies in the southern sky is centred on aco 3627 @xmath13 ( abell et al .",
    "1989 ) , just below the galactic plane close to the cross - section with the supergalactic plane .",
    "other major concentrations of galaxies in figure 1 are the hydra cluster @xmath14 and the centaurus cluster @xmath15 .",
    "the cluster properties of aco 3627 proof this cluster to be a rich , massive cluster of galaxies comparable to the well known coma cluster , but closer in redshift - space ( @xmath16 km s@xmath17 vs. @xmath18 km s@xmath17 ) ( kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "this view is supported by the recent observations of aco 3627 with the rosat pspc , which finds this cluster to be the 6@xmath19 brightest x - ray cluster in the rosat all sky survey ( bhringer et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in figure 2",
    "we have superimposed the x - ray contours on the central part of aco 3627 , as reproduced from the eso / src iiiaj film copy of field 136 .",
    "the contours of the 843 mhz radio continuum emission from 2 galaxies in aco 3627 ( jones & mcadam 1992 ) are also plotted .",
    "both the x - ray and the radio continuum emission provides substantial additional information on the cluster morphology and the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) of aco 3627 .",
    "like many rich clusters , aco 3627 shows distinct subclustering in the x - ray morphology . in figure 2 ,",
    "the x - ray shows extended emission towards the se corner ( bottom - left ) .",
    "after the subtraction of a spherical symmetric model , a residual component remains , suggestive of a subcluster in the process of merging ( bhringer et al .",
    "1996 , kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "this view is bolstered by the radio - morphology of pks1610 - 608 .",
    "this strong ( one of the 20 strongest extra - galactic radio sources ) wide - angle - tail source embraces the merging system ( cf .",
    "figure 3 of kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "1996b ) , revealing a strong motion of the cluster gas in a subcluster merger ( jones & mcadam 1996 and burns et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "aco 3627 harbours two other interesting galaxies : the head - tail radio - source b1610 - 605 and a seyfert 1.3 galaxy .",
    "the head - tail source shows an alignment with the 3rd contour of the main x - ray component over nearly its full extent .",
    "jones & mcadam ( 1996 ) find a particularly high pressure near the peak of b1610 - 605 , indicative of the ram pressure as the galaxy moves through the icm .",
    "the strong x - ray point source in the top - right corner of figure 2 is a seyfert 1.3 galaxy , first discovered by spectroscopy ( woudt et al .",
    "redshift observations are required to map the newly found galaxies in 3 dimensions . for this",
    "we have used three complimentary approaches :    * multifiber spectroscopy with optopus and mefos at the 3.6-m telescope of eso for galaxies in the densest regions ( cayatte et al .",
    "1994 , kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "1994 and felenbok et al .",
    "1996 ) * individual spectroscopy of the brightest galaxies with the 1.9-m telescope of saao ( kraan - korteweg et al .  1995 ) * 21-cm observations of extended lsb spirals with the 64-m parkes radio telescope ( kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "1996b )    11.3 cm    figure 3 shows an equal area distribution of all the galaxies in the southern hemisphere with @xmath20 km s@xmath17 , i.e.  centred on the approximate redshift - distance of the ga .    in this redshift range aco 3627",
    "is seen to be the central , dominant component of a `` great wall''-like structure , a broad structure including the indus group @xmath21 km s@xmath1 , the pavo cluster @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 km s@xmath1 crossing the central part of the ga region towards @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 km s@xmath1 where it possibly merges with the vela supercluster at @xmath28 @xmath29 , @xmath30 km s@xmath1 ( kraan - korteweg & woudt 1994b ) .",
    "the here emerging picture of the galaxy distribution supports the earlier suggestions that the ga is an extended region of moderately enhanced density with the cluster aco 3627 now marking the previously unidentified core of the great attractor .",
    "due to its proximity , the cluster aco 3627 provides an excellent sample to investigate environmental effects on its galaxies .",
    "our presently ongoing atca observations of four selected regions in aco 3627 , in combination with our other observations , will allow a detailed study of the icm in aco 3627 .",
    "is aco 3627 at rest with respect to the cosmic microwave background ? here , the tully - fisher relation for spirals and the @xmath31 analysis of early type galaxies  although difficult due to the foreground extinction ( mould et al .",
    "1991 )  will give us the answer .",
    "a further reduction of the remaining zoa ( @xmath32 ) will be achieved with the forthcoming multibeam zoa - survey at the parkes 64-m radio telescope .",
    "it will yet be another step towards a true all - sky distribution of galaxies .",
    "only then can we trace the full extent of the norma ( aco 3627 ) supercluster .",
