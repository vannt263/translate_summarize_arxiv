    "s , zwicky , by assuming that the cluster in the coma constellation , containing hundreds of bright galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coma ] ) , is in virial equilibrium , found that the mass required to bind the system gravitationally should be roughly hundred times larger than the sum of the masses of the individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "in fact , if the cluster is an isolated , spherically symmetric system in dynamical equilibrium , the virial theorem yields the total mass @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gravitational constant , @xmath9 is the dispersion of the galaxy velocities along the line of sight , and @xmath10 is the cluster size @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the projected separation between galaxies @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the number of galaxies ; equation ( [ eq : size ] ) assumes that all the galaxies have the same mass .",
    "clusters are not isolated systems and the correct application of the virial theorem requires the inclusion of a surface term @xcite . however , correcting for this factor , and correcting also for departures from spherical symmetry , for galaxies of different masses and for the presence of interlopers , namely galaxies which are not cluster members but appear projected onto the cluster field of view , is not sufficient to fill in the discrepancy between the virial mass and the sum of the galaxy masses .",
    "we can reach the same conclusion with a more sophisticated dynamical analysis based on the jeans equations @xcite .",
    "zwicky s result was the first indication of the existence of dark matter .    with the advent of astrophysics from space in 1960 s , the _ uhuru _ satellite revealed that clusters are the most luminous extended x - ray sources on the sky ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "[ fig : coma ] ) .",
    "the origin of the x - ray luminosity @xmath16 was very early interpreted as thermal bremsstrahlung emission from a hot intracluster plasma ( @xcite ; @xcite - chapter 8 , and @xcite - chapter 9 , this volume ) : @xmath17 { \\rm d}^3{\\bf r } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the electron and ion number densities in the intracluster medium ( icm ) and @xmath20 is a cooling function . for temperatures @xmath21 kev ( @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant ) , when the icm is almost fully ionised , we have @xmath23 .",
    "the existence of a hot diffuse x - ray emitting gas implies the presence of a deep gravitational potential well that keeps the gas confined .",
    "this evidence made untenable the hypothesis that clusters are chance superpositions of galaxies or expanding systems @xcite . by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry , the cumulative mass within radius @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath27 the proton mass and @xmath28 the gas mass density .",
    "this type of analysis confirmed that at least @xmath29 of the cluster mass is dark @xcite , and the rest is almost all in the diffuse icm component : galaxies only contribute a few percent to the total cluster mass , as inferred by zwicky in 1937 .    in this same 1937 paper",
    ", zwicky also realized that one way to avoid the assumption of dynamical equilibrium when estimating the cluster mass is to use the deflection of light of background sources determined by the cluster gravitational potential well ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stronglens ] ) ; for an axially symmetric cluster , the total mass projected along the line of sight within the distance @xmath24 of closest approach of the light rays to the cluster centre is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the speed of light , and @xmath32 is the deflection angle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the first indication of a gravitational lensing effect in a galaxy cluster appeared fifty years later @xcite . to date , both strong gravitational lensing @xcite , which creates multiple images of background sources , and weak gravitational lensing @xcite , which produces small induced ellipticity in the shape of background galaxies , indicate that , if general relativity is correct on the scales of clusters , @xmath33% of the cluster mass is dark .",
    "an alternative method to estimate the cluster mass , both in their virial region and their outskirts , which does not rely on the virial equilibrium assumption , is the caustic technique introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this technique exploits the distribution of galaxies in redshift space to infer the galaxy escape velocity from the gravitational potential",
    "well of the cluster , and hence its mass .",
    "in fact , in the redshift diagram , namely line - of - sight velocity vs. projected distance @xmath24 from the cluster centre , cluster galaxies populate a trumpet - shaped region limited by two curves , named caustics , whose separation @xmath34 at each radius @xmath24 is proportional to the escape velocity . for a spherically symmetric cluster ,",

    "it has become clear that the icm is chemically enriched to @xmath37 solar abundances ( @xcite - chapter 16 , this volume ) : given the relative mass contribution of the cluster components , it follows that the total mass in metals in the icm is larger than the sum of the mass in metals of the individual galaxies .      ) , clj1429.0 + 4241 ( @xmath38 ) and clj1226.9 + 3332 ( @xmath39 ) .",

    "right after the detection of the x - ray emission from clusters , @xcite realised that inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the free electrons of the icm can produce secondary anisotropies in the cmb maps : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a spectral function and @xmath42 is the comptonization parameter ; here , @xmath43 is the electron mass , @xmath44 the thomson cross - section , and the integral is along the line of sight @xmath45 .",

    "the sensitivity of radio telescopes and the control of systematics have been sufficient to measure reliably this sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect and its spectral signature in massive clusters @xcite .",
    "the major advantage of the sz effect is that the amplitude of the cmb fluctuation is independent of the cluster redshift @xmath48 , because the cmb intensity increases as @xmath49 and compensates the @xmath50 decrease of the sz `` surface brightness '' .",
    "this property has recently boosted an entire research field of cluster surveys with the sz effect @xcite .",

    "this morphology - density relation has been known since a publication of shapley in 1926 , and possibly earlier . the first statistical analysis based on a large sample of 55 clusters showed that , in the local universe , the fraction of spirals is 80% , 60% and 0% in the field , outskirts and cores of clusters , respectively @xcite .",
    "subsequent work confirmed the connection between galaxy properties and local density : spirals in clusters are h- and dust - deficient , have larger metallicity and show an excess of radio continuum emission ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .    at higher redshifts ( @xmath90 ) , the fraction of spirals and irregulars in high - density regions increases at the expense of the fraction of lenticulars @xcite .",
    "larger gas reservoirs and galaxy close encounters and collisions , which are more frequent in dense environments and favour the transformation of galaxy morphology , increase the star formation activity , as it occurs in starburst galaxies ; indeed mid - infrared observations of luminous infrared galaxies show a more intense star formation activity in cluster environment at increasing redshift @xcite .",
    "although , on average , the properties of galaxies vary smoothly from the cluster centre to the outskirts , before reaching the average properties of galaxies in the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "moreover , the x - ray morphology is increasingly irregular with increasing redshift @xcite . where the angular resolution is low and detailed maps of the x - ray surface brightness can not be obtained , a clear indication that , in some clusters , the icm might be out of equilibrium comes from the hard , possibly thermal , excess ( @xcite - chapter 5 , this volume ) , which appears when the x - ray spectrum is fitted assuming a plasma with single temperature and metallicity . in these cases ,",

    "a possible solution has been identified in the inhibition of the icm cooling by the energy injection of agn jets , as suggested by the x - ray cavities in correspondence of the radio emission observed around cluster central galaxies @xcite ; the presence of these cavities correlates with the x - ray temperature drops in the centre of some clusters , early interpreted as cooling flows @xcite ; however , the details of the heating mechanism by agn jets remain uncertain @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty when treating most of the dissipative processes resides in the fact that they occur on scales much smaller than the spatial resolution of the simulation and must be approximated by phenomenological recipes : gas cooling , star formation and stellar evolution , which occur at scales @xmath124 pc , have effects on galactic and extragalactic scales @xmath125 mpc ; thus the simulations should model a spatial range of at least six orders of magnitude .",
    "these large dynamic ranges can be covered by neither a single numerical experiment nor experiments which rely on the resimulation technique , where an individual cluster extracted from a large - scale cosmological simulation is resimulated at a much higher resolution with appropriate boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the large number of physical processes and the large computational resources required to run an @xmath15-body / hydrodynamics simulation for a realistic modeling of cluster and galaxy formation have suggested a complementary strategy to explore more efficiently the parameter space : the combination of semi - analytic models with merger trees of dark matter halos extracted from dissipationless n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "this approach has reproduced the evolution and present - day spatial and kinematic distribution of galaxies in the universe and in clusters @xcite .",
    "the major shortcoming of this strategy is that severe uncertainties in the predictions can be introduced by the crude simplification of the physical processes and especially of the thermodynamics of the icm , usually assumed to be isothermal and in hydrostatic equilibrium within each dark matter halo .",
    "some improvements can be introduced by describing the icm thermal properties in terms of entropy generation and distribution @xcite , but much work remains to be done .",

    "<S> clusters of galaxies are self - gravitating systems of mass @xmath0 m@xmath1 and size @xmath2 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> their mass budget consists of dark matter ( @xmath3 , on average ) , hot diffuse intracluster plasma ( @xmath4 ) and a small fraction of stars , dust , and cold gas , mostly locked in galaxies . in most clusters , </S>",
    "<S> scaling relations between their properties , like mass , galaxy velocity dispersion , x - ray luminosity and temperature , testify that the cluster components are in approximate dynamical equilibrium within the cluster gravitational potential well . however , spatially inhomogeneous thermal and non - thermal emission of the intracluster medium ( icm ) , observed in some clusters in the x - ray and radio bands , and the kinematic and morphological segregation of galaxies are a signature of non - gravitational processes , ongoing cluster merging and interactions . both the fraction of clusters with these features , and the correlation between the dynamical and morphological properties of irregular clusters and the surrounding large - scale structure increase with redshift .    in the current bottom - up scenario for the formation of cosmic structure , where tiny fluctuations of the otherwise homogeneous primordial density field are amplified by gravity , </S>",
    "<S> clusters are the most massive nodes of the filamentary large - scale structure of the cosmic web and form by anisotropic and episodic accretion of mass , in agreement with most of the observational evidence . in this model of the universe dominated by cold dark matter , at the present time most baryons are expected to be in a diffuse component rather than in stars and galaxies ; moreover , @xmath5 of this diffuse component has temperature @xmath6 kev and permeates the filamentary distribution of the dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of this warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) increases with the local density and its search in the outer regions of clusters and lower density regions has been the quest of much recent observational effort .    over the last thirty years , an impressive coherent picture of the formation and evolution of cosmic structures has emerged from the intense interplay between observations , theory and numerical experiments . </S>",
    "<S> future efforts will continue to test whether this picture keeps being valid , needs corrections or suffers dramatic failures in its predictive power . </S>"
