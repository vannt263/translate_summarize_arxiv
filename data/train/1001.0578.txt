    "the impact of mobile impurities on transport through a quantum conductor attracted a lot of attention soon after it was realized that the conductance of a dirty coherent sample is sensitive to the position of a single impurity ; this discovery formed the basis for the explanation of flicker noise as it appears due to the presence of bistable mobile impurities.@xcite a detailed characterization of charge transport through a quantum conductor is provided by the full counting statistics ( fcs).@xcite during the past decade , this description has been applied to numerous systems @xcite and a first attempt to describe the influence of a two - level fluctuator on the fcs of quantum transport has been given in ref .  .",
    "in the present paper , we calculate the full counting statistics of charge transport through a ( classical or quantum ) point contact coupled to a classical two - level fluctuator ; we go beyond previous studies by considering the combined effects of the presence of one or many mobile impurities , as well as quantum - partitioning and the fermi statistics on the fcs .",
    "also , we reconsider carefully the case when partitioning is neglected and correct previous findings which are flawed when calculating the fourth or higher cumulants .    the influence of a fluctuating ( uncontrollable ) environment on a ( controllable ) device is a generic problem @xcite and our work is related to other studies , e.g. , the transport statistics through a quantum dot in the coulomb - blockade regime @xcite or the effect of a bistability on the transport through a quantum point contact@xcite .",
    "another example is the dephasing of qubits due to a classical @xcite or quantum @xcite two - level system , or the studies on @xmath0-noise originating from telegraph noise due to classical @xcite or quantum @xcite two - level fluctuators .",
    "the two problems , full counting statistics of charge transport and dephasing of a quantum system ( qubits ) are related through the equivalence of fidelity @xcite and full counting statistics @xcite , as has been pointed out recently.@xcite    in our analysis below , we describe the time evolution of the two - level fluctuator by rate equations which can be solved explicitly .",
    "we then study the full counting statistics of a wire with a conductance depending on the state of the fluctuator .",
    "the fluctuator induces noise in the transport current through the wire which we evaluate using a mapping of correlation functions on matrix products . using this mapping ,",
    "we are able to calculate the full counting statistics of a classical wire coupled to a two - level fluctuator .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the situation of a second ( independent ) fluctuator and show that a nonlinear interaction with the wire can lead to correlations in the noise even though the fluctuators evolve independent of each other . finally , we apply our method to the case of a quantum wire which exhibits intrinsic partitioning ( shot ) noise.@xcite we derive a formula which incorporates both classical- ( due to the two - level fluctuator ) and quantum- ( due to the point contact ) noise .",
    "thereby , we give an explicit expression for the full counting statistics of a quantum point contact whose transmission probabilities change with time . as two - level fluctuators seem to be a major obstacle for achieving solid state implementations of qubits with long coherence times , being able to characterize the influence of a two - level fluctuator on transport through a point contact offers the possibility to learn about the fluctuating environment by measuring the full counting statistics through a nearby quantum point contact . the ( partial ) overlap of our results with previous work@xcite will be discussed below .     with rates @xmath1 and @xmath2",

    "for the case of a quantum point contact , we have shown that the partitioning noise and the noise due the two - level fluctuator add up and the noise crosses over from sub- to super - poissonian depending on the applied voltage bias .",
    "to extend the present formalism to the case of current correlators at finite frequencies , which provides additional insights into the dynamics of the two - level fluctuator , is an interesting problem for future studies .",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with misha suslov and financial support from the pauli center at eth zurich , the swiss national foundation , the russian foundation for basic research ( 11 - 02 - 00744-a ) , the program ` quantum physics of condensed matter ' of the ras , and the computer company nix ( f1025/10 - 04 ) .",
