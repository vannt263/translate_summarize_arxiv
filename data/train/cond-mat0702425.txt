    "the trembling motion ( zitterbewegung , zb ) , first devised by schroedinger for free relativistic electrons in a vacuum @xcite , has become in the last two years subject of great theoretical interest as it has turned out that this phenomenon should occur in many situations in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "whenever one deals with two or more energy branches , an interference of the corresponding upper and lower energy states results in the trembling motion even in the absence of external fields . due to a formal similarity between two interacting bands in a solid and the dirac equation for relativistic electron in a vacuum one can use methods developed in the relativistic quantum mechanics for non - relativistic electrons in solids @xcite .",
    "most of the zb studies for semiconductors took as a starting point plane electron waves ( see , however , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", lock @xcite in his important paper observed : such a wave is not localized and it seems to be of a limited practicality to speak of rapid fluctuations in the average position of a wave of infinite extent. using the dirac equation lock showed that , when an electron is represented by a wave packet , the zb oscillations do not remain undamped but become transient .",
    "in particular , the disappearance of oscillations at sufficiently large times is guaranteed by the riemann - lebesgue theorem as long as the wave packet is a smoothly varying function .",
    "since the zb is by its nature not a stationary state but a dynamical phenomenon , it is natural to study it with the use of wave packets .",
    "these have become a practical instrument when femtosecond pulse technology emerged ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the following we study theoretically the zitterbewegung of mobile charge carriers in three modern materials : bilayer graphene , monolayer graphene and carbon nanotubes .",
    "we have three objectives in mind .",
    "first , we obtain for the first time analytical results for the zb of gaussian wave packets which allows us to study not only the trembling motion itself but also effects that accompany this phenomenon .",
    "second , we describe for the first time the transient character of zb in solids , testing on specific examples the general predictions of ref .",
    "third , we look for observable phenomena and select both systems and parameters which appear most promising for experiments .",
    "we first present our analytical results for bilayer graphene and then quote some predictions for observable quantities in monolayer graphene and carbon nanotubes .",
    "two - dimensional hamiltonian for bilayer graphene is well approximated by @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 .",
    "the form ( [ bg_h ] ) is valid for energies @xmath2mev in the conduction band .",
    "the energy spectrum is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , i.e. there is no energy gap between the conduction and valence bands .",

    "the third term represents the zitterbewegung with the frequency @xmath9 , corresponding to the energy difference between the upper and lower energy branches for a given value of @xmath10 .",
    "we want to calculate the zb of a charge carrier represented by a two - dimensional wave packet @xmath11 the packet is centered at @xmath12 and is characterized by a width @xmath13 .",
    "the unit vector @xmath14 is a convenient choice , selecting the [ 11 ] component of @xmath15 , see eq .",

    "we enumerate the main features of zb following from eqs .",
    "( [ bg_x(t ) ] ) and ( [ bg_xz(t ) ] ) .",
    "first , in order to have the zb in the direction @xmath21 one needs an initial transverse momentum @xmath22 .",
    "second , the zb frequency depends only weakly on the packet width : @xmath23 , while its amplitude is strongly dependent on the width @xmath13 .",
    "third , the zb has a transient character , as it is attenuated by the exponential term . for small @xmath24",
    "the amplitude of @xmath25 diminishes as @xmath26 with @xmath27 fourth , as @xmath24 ( or @xmath28 ) increases the cosine term tends to unity and the first term in eq .",
    "( [ bg_xz(t ) ] ) cancels out with the second term , which illustrates the riemann - lebesgue theorem ( see ref .",
    "after the oscillations disappear , the charge carrier is displaced by the amount @xmath29 , which is a remnant of zb .",
    "fifth , for very narrow packets ( @xmath30 ) the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ bg_xz(t ) ] ) tends to unity , the oscillatory term is @xmath31 and the last term vanishes . in this limit",
    "we recover undamped zb oscillations .",

    "the decay time is @xmath36 fs , see eq .",

    "the zitterbewegung is also accompanied by a time dependence of upper and lower components of the wave function . to characterize this evolution",
    "we define probability densities for the upper and lower components @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and the time - dependent wave function is @xmath41 .",
    "we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 . for @xmath44",

    "clearly , there must be @xmath48 at any time , but it is seen that the probability density flows back and forth between the two components .",
    "it is clear that the oscillating probability is directly related to zb . since in bilayer graphene",
    "the upper and lower components are associated with the first or second layer , respectively @xcite , it follows that , at least for this system , the trembling motion represents oscillations of a charge carrier between the two graphene layers . for sufficiently long times",
    "there is @xmath49 , so that the final probability is equally distributed between the two layers . for a very narrow packet ( @xmath50 )",
    "we have @xmath51 $ ] , which indicates that the probability oscillates without attenuation .",
    "for @xmath52 there is @xmath53 $ ] , i.e. there are no oscillations and the initial probability @xmath14 simply decays into @xmath54 .    the above phenomenon can be considered from the point of view of the entropy : @xmath55@xmath56 . at the beginning",
    "( the carrier is in one layer ) the entropy is zero , at the end ( when the probability is equally distributed in two layers ) the entropy is @xmath57 .",
    "however , the entropy increases in the oscillatory fashion ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the transient character of zb is accompanied by a temporal spreading of the wave packet .",
    "in fact , the question arises whether the damping of zb is not simply _ caused _ by the spreading of the packet . to study this question we calculate an explicit form of the wave function given by integrals ( [ bg_psit ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath58 , \\ \\",
    "\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath59 @xmath60 , \\ \\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is seen that the packet , which was gaussian at @xmath44 ( see eq .",
    "( [ bg_psi ] ) ) , is _ not _ gaussian at later times ( see discussion ) .",
    "the upper and lower components have the same decay time , oscillation period , etc . in order to characterize the spreading ( or dispersion ) of the packet we calculate its width @xmath35 as a function of time",
    "@xmath63 ^ 2 = \\langle \\psi(\\bm r , t)|\\hat{\\bm r}^2 - \\langle \\hat{\\bm r } \\rangle^2 | \\psi(\\bm r , t)\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the above two - component wave function and @xmath65 .",
    "the calculated width @xmath66 is plotted versus time in fig .",
    "it is seen that during the initial 80 femtoseconds the packet s width increases only twice compared to its initial value , while the zb and the accompanying effects disappear almost completely during this time .",
    "we conclude that the spreading of the packet is _ not _ the main cause of the transient character of the zb . in fact , also the spreading oscillates a little , but this effect is too small to be seen in fig . [ fig1]d .",
    "it is well known that the phenomenon of zb is due to an interference of wave functions corresponding to positive and negative eigen - energies of the initial hamiltonian .",
    "looking for physical reasons behind the transient character of zb described above , we decompose the total wave function @xmath64 into the positive ( @xmath67 ) and negative ( @xmath68 ) components @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we have @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the eigen - functions of the hamiltonian ( [ bg_h ] ) in @xmath74 space corresponding to positive and negative energies , respectively .",
    "further @xmath75 after some manipulations we finally obtain @xmath76 the function @xmath70 is given by the identical expression with the changed signs in front of @xmath77 and @xmath78 terms .",
    "there is @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "now we calculate the average values of @xmath81 and @xmath82 using the positive and negative components in the above sense .",
    "we have @xmath83 so that we deal with four integrals .",
    "a direct calculation gives @xmath84 @xmath85 where @xmath29 and @xmath25 have been defined in eq .",
    "( [ bg_x(t ) ] ) .",
    "thus the integrals involving only the positive and only the negative components give the constant shift due to zb , while the mixed terms lead to the zb oscillations .",
    "all terms together reconstruct the result ( [ bg_x(t ) ] ) .",
    "next we calculate the average value @xmath82 .",
    "there is no symmetry between @xmath81 and @xmath82 because the wave packet is centered around @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the average value @xmath82 is again given by four integrals .",
    "however , now the mixed terms vanish since they contain odd integrands of @xmath88 , while the integrals involving the positive and negative components alone give @xmath89 this means that the positive and negative subpackets move in the opposite directions with the same velocity @xmath90 .",
    "the relative velocity is @xmath91 .",
    "each of these packets has the initial width @xmath13 and it ( slowly ) spreads in time . after the time @xmath92 the distance between the two packets equals @xmath13 , so the integrals ( [ bg_x_mix ] ) are small , resulting in the diminishing zitterbewegung amplitude .",
    "this reasoning gives the decay constant @xmath93 , which is exactly what we determined above from the analytical results ( see eq . ( [ bg_gammaz ] ) ) .",
    "thus , _ the transient character of the zb oscillations is due to the increasing spacial separation of the subpackets _ corresponding to the positive and negative energy states .",
    "this confirms our previous conclusion that it is not the packet s slow spreading that is responsible for the attenuation ( see discussion ) .",
    "however , as we show below , also spreading may possibly play this role in some cases .    to conclude our analytical discussion of the zb in bilayer graphene we consider an interesting property of the velocity squared .",
    "if @xmath94 and @xmath95 are calculated directly from the hamiltonian ( [ bg_h ] ) , then it is easy to show that @xmath96 and @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 does not depend on time . in the heisenberg picture we split the velocity components into classical and zb parts @xmath99 and similarly for @xmath100 . noting that @xmath101 we have @xmath102 .",
    "( [ bg_vx(t ) ] ) we show that each of these terms is time independent : @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and similarly for @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , the velocity squared of the zb component @xmath107=@xmath108=@xmath109 is equal to that of the classical component @xmath110=@xmath111=@xmath109 .",
    "now we turn to monolayer graphene . the two - dimensional band hamiltonian describing",
    "its band structure is @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113cm / s .",
    "the resulting energy dispersion is linear in momentum : @xmath114 , where @xmath115 . the quantum velocity in the schroedinger picture is @xmath116 , it does not commute with the hamiltonian ( [ mg_h ] ) . in the heisenberg picture we have @xmath117 . using eq .",

    "we calculate an average velocity ( or current ) taken over the wave packet given by eq .",
    "( [ bg_psi ] ) . the averaging procedure amounts to a double integral .",
    "the latter is not analytical and we compute it numerically .",
    "the results for the current @xmath121 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath122m@xmath123 and different realistic packet widths @xmath13 ( see ref .",
    "it is seen that the zb frequency does not depend on @xmath13 and is nearly equal to @xmath124 given above for the plane wave . on the other hand ,",
    "the amplitude of zb does depend on @xmath13 and we deal with decay times of the order of femtoseconds . for small @xmath13",
    "there are almost no oscillations , for very large @xmath13 the zb oscillations are undamped .",

    "finally , we consider monolayer graphene sheets rolled into single semiconducting carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) .",
    "the band hamiltonian in this case is similar to eq .",
    "( [ mg_h ] ) except that , because of the periodic boundary conditions , the momentum @xmath126 is quantized and takes discrete values @xmath127 , where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 is the length of circumference of cnt @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the free electron motion can occur only in the direction @xmath132 , parallel to the tube axis .",

    "( [ bg_psit_s ] ) ) we can decompose the total wave packet ( [ cnt_psi ] ) into the positive and negative subpackets with the result @xmath160 the function @xmath161 is given by a similar expression with the changed signs in front of @xmath77 and @xmath162 terms .",
    "here we use the notation @xmath163 and @xmath164 . now",

    "( [ cnt_psip2y ] ) gives @xmath171 , as before .",
    "for @xmath52 the second term vanishes which physically means that the relative velocity of the two subpackets is zero , so that they stay together in time .",
    "it is for this reason that the decay of zb is slow ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath172 , the second term in eq . ( [ cnt_psip2y ] ) does not vanish , the two subpackets run away from each other , their overlap diminishes and the zb disappears much more quickly .",
    "the question remains : what is the physical reason for the ( slow ) damping of the zb electron shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , if the subpackets stay together ?",
    "( as we mentioned in the introduction , the mathematical expression for the damping phenomenon is the riemann - lebesgue theorem . ) trying to answer this question we calculated the spreading of the wave subpackets ( [ cnt_psit_pos ] ) in time . for the initial width @xmath173 ",
    "the subpackets reach the width @xmath174   after the time of @xmath175 fs ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "thus , we would be tempted to say that it is the spreading of the packets that is responsible for the attenuation of zb .",
    "however , it should be noted that , while at higher times the packet s dispersion is linear in time ( see ref . @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig3]d ) , the amplitude of zb oscillations decays as @xmath158 .",
    "a similar slow damping of zb occurs for one - dimensional relativistic electrons in a vacuum if the average momentum of the subpackets is zero ( see discussion ) .",
    "it is of interest that the zb phenomena similar to those described above occur also for wave packets representing free relativistic electrons in a vacuum governed by the dirac equation .",
    "this confirms again the strong similarity of the two - band models for non - relativistic electrons in solids to the description of free relativistic electrons in a vacuum , see refs .",
    "in contrast to bilayer graphene , the kinematics of the one - dimensional relativistic wave packets may not be described analytically , so the solutions were computed numerically and visualized graphically by thaller @xcite .",
    "it was shown that : 1 ) an initial relativistic gaussian wave packet after spreading is not gaussian any more .",
    "this is analogous to our eqs .",
    "( [ bg_psi_up ] ) and ( [ bg_psi_low ] ) .",
    "2 ) if an average momentum of the initial positive and negative subpackets is zero , the overlap of the two subpackets remains almost constant in time and the resulting zb decays quite slowly .",
    "this corresponds to our considerations of cnt with @xmath52 , see fig .",
    "( it is to be reminded that the two overlapping subpackets are orthogonal to each other . )",
    "3 ) if the initial average momentum of both subpackets is nonzero , the two subpackets quickly run away from each other and the zb falls quickly since it is sustained only when the subpackets have some overlap in the position space .",
    "this corresponds to our considerations of bilayer graphene , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the transient zb of free relativistic wave packets in a vacuum was also studied numerically by braun _",
    "it was shown that , for example , the decay times of a typical wave packet having the width @xmath176 and the initial wave vector @xmath177 a.u .",
    "is @xmath178 fs .",
    "this should be compared with our predicted decay times of @xmath36 fs for bilayer graphene .",
    "it turns out once again that solids are much more promising media for an observation of zitterbewegung than a vacuum .",
    "the zitterbewegung phenomenon described above should not be confused with the bloch oscillations of charge carriers in superlattices , although the latter occur at picosecond frequencies and have comparable picoseconds decay times ( see e.g. refs .",
    "however , the bloch oscillations are basically a one - band phenomenon , they have been realized in superlattices ( although this is in principle not the condition _ sine qua non _ ) and , most importantly , they require an external electric field driving electrons all the way to the brillouin zone boundary . on the other hand , the zb needs at least two bands and it is a no - field phenomenon . on the other hand , narrow - gap superlattices could provide a suitable medium of its observation .    in view of our results",
    "it is clear that , in order to observe the transient zitterbewegung , it is necessary to prepare simultaneously a sufficient number of charge carriers in the form of wave packets .",
    "if one wants to detect the current , the trembling motion of all carriers must have the same phase . on the other hand ,",
    "if one wants to see only the remnant displacement , the phase coherence is not necessary . as we said above , the zb frequency is to a good accuracy given by the corresponding energy difference between the upper and lower energy branches while the amplitude depends strongly on packet s width .",
    "for the two graphene materials considered above one needs an initial momentum in one direction to have the zb along the transverse direction ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for nanotubes",
    "the initial momentum is automatically there due to the circular boundary conditions .",
    "the oscillatory motion between two graphene layers , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c , appears to be a promising phenomenon for observation .",
    "as far as the detection is concerned , one needs sensitive current meters or scanning probe microscopy , both working at infrared frequencies and femtosecond to picosecond decay times ( see refs .",
    "in summary , using the two - band structure of bilayer graphene , monolayer graphene and carbon nanotubes we show that charge carriers in these materials , localized in the form of gaussian wave packets , exhibit the transient zitterbewegung with the decay times of femtoseconds in graphene and picoseconds in nanotubes .",
    "observable dynamical zb effects , most notably the electric current , are described .",
    "it is demonstrated that , after the trembling motion disappears , there remains its trace in the form of a persistent charge displacement .",
    "it is emphasized that the described zb in solids is in close analogy to that of the relativistic electron in a vacuum .",

    "<S> it is shown that , when the charge carriers are prepared in the form of gaussian wave packets , the zb has a transient character with the decay time of femtoseconds in graphene and picoseconds in nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> analytical results for bilayer graphene allow us to investigate phenomena which accompany the trembling motion . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is shown that the transient character of zb in graphene is due to the fact that wave subpackets related to positive and negative electron energies move in opposite directions , so their overlap diminishes with time . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is analogous to that of the wave packets representing relativistic electrons in a vacuum . </S>"
