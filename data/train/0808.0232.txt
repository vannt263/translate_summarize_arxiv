    "<S> the properties of the b - meson light - cone wave function up to next - to - leading order fock state expansion have been studied through a comparative study of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 transition form factors within the @xmath2 factorization approach and the light - cone sum rule analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the transition form factors @xmath3 and @xmath4 are carefully re - calculated up to @xmath5 within the @xmath2 factorization approach in the large recoil region , in which the main theoretical uncertainties are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd light - cone sum rule is applicable in the large and intermediate energy regions , and the qcd light - cone sum rule results in ref.@xcite are adopted for such a comparative study . </S>",

    "<S> however , the b - meson wf still poses a major source of uncertainty in the study of b meson decays . unless we have known it well and applied it for some precise studies , we can not definitely say that there is really new physics in the b - meson decays , e.g. the so called @xmath10 puzzle @xcite and etc .. hence , theoretically , it is an important issue to study on it .    </S>",
    "<S> an analytic solution for the leading fock - state b - meson wf , which is derived under the wandzura - wilczek ( ww ) approximation @xcite and with the help of the equation of motion of the light spectator quark in the b meson , has been given in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the leading fock - state b - meson wf can be determined uniquely in analytic form in terms of the `` effective mass '' ( @xmath11 ) @xcite of the meson state and its transverse momentum dependence is just determined through a simple delta function . </S>",
    "<S> this simple model has been frequently used for a leading order estimation of the b - meson decays . </S>",
    "<S> it is argued that when including the 3-particle fock states contribution , the transverse momentum distribution may be expanded to a certain degree other than such a simple delta function . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from the higher fock states may not be too small , e.g. in ref.@xcite , the 3-particle contributions are estimated by attaching an extra gluon to the internal off - shell quark line , and then @xmath12 power suppression is readily induced . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a simple model for the b - meson wave function up to next - to - leading fock state has been raised in ref.@xcite , where relations between the 2- and 3- particle wavefunctions derived from the qcd equations of motion and the heavy quark symmetry @xcite , especially two constraints derived from the gauge field equation of motion , are employed . </S>",
