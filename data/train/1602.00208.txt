    "since then , the bound has been a useful tool for studying various algorithmic and number - theoretic problems : in @xcite it was used to study the complexity of recovering a sparse polynomial from a small number of approximate values ( which is relevant to the security of polynomial pseudorandom number generators ) , in @xcite it was used to study the singularity of generalized vandermonde matrices over @xmath18 , in @xcite it was used to study the solutions of exponential congruences @xmath30 , and in @xcite it was used to study the correlation of linear recurring sequences over @xmath31 .",
    "the main result of this paper is a new bound ( theorem [ bound ] of section 2 below ) improving theorem [ d ] by removing the asymptotic term and replacing @xmath32 by a smaller , intrinsic parameter .",
    "more recently in @xcite , bi , cheng , and rojas studied the computational complexity of deciding whether a @xmath0-nomial @xmath2 has a root in @xmath33 .",
    "they gave a sub - linear algorithm for this problem ; we give a rough sketch here .",
    "first , they efficiently replace any instance with a @xmath0-nomial of degree bounded by @xmath34 ( while preserving the answer to the decision problem ) , and then they compute the greatest common divisor of this instance and @xmath35 , which can be done in time proportional to the degree of the instance . as a result of their investigation , they derive the following characterization of the roots of a sparse polynomial in @xmath14}$ ] .",

    "the set of nonzero roots of @xmath2 in @xmath18 is the union of no more than @xmath37 cosets of two subgroups @xmath38 of @xmath33 , where @xmath39    this result does not immediately yield any bound on the number of roots @xmath17 since there is no upper bound given for the size of the @xmath40-cosets .",
    "however , if for some reason we were assured that the set of roots was a union of only @xmath41-cosets , we could conclude @xmath42 which is an improvement on theorem [ d ] since it can be easily checked that @xmath43 always .",

    "the members of this coset are exactly the roots of the binomial @xmath51 .",
    "so , @xmath2 vanishes completely on this coset if and only if @xmath52 , or equivalently if @xmath53 .    to see",
    "when this happens , we view @xmath2 in the ring @xmath14}/ \\langle x^k - \\beta \\rangle$ ] . in this ring",
    ", we have the relation @xmath54 , so if each @xmath8 has remainder @xmath55 , then @xmath56 now @xmath2 might be identically zero ( in this ring ) since the @xmath57 s are not necessarily distinct .",
    "however , there is one obvious barrier to this : if just one @xmath57 is unique , then @xmath2 in particular contains the nonzero monomial @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 requires that each remainder @xmath57 has at least one  partner \" @xmath60 so that monomials can cancel .",
    "therefore @xmath61 implies that , for each @xmath62 , there is some @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",

    "in fact , we can get another easily computable upper bound for @xmath65 that is in general tighter than @xmath80 .",

    "when @xmath7 is odd , this binomial vanishes at every non - square in @xmath87 , and consequently @xmath97 . more generally , when @xmath98 is divisible by @xmath0 , the @xmath0-nomial @xmath99 vanishes on @xmath100 cosets of size @xmath101 , and so @xmath102 .",
    "these examples show that there is no hope to improve the bound in theorem [ bound ] by removing the dependence on @xmath76 .",

    "thus , both examples are able to attain a large number of roots in @xmath87 without vanishing on a large coset , and they show that the @xmath121 bound from theorem [ bound ] is nearly optimal in the general setting .",
    "however , these examples both share a special property - they vanish on entire translations of a subspace of @xmath18 .",
    "we are unaware of any example of a sparse polynomial which has a large number of roots in  general position . \" consequently , we propose that a much better bound is possible for the special case of prime fields @xmath122 , which have no proper subfields .",

    "the general strategy employed here ( and in both @xcite and @xcite ) for obtaining sparsity - dependent bounds on @xmath17 can be loosely sketched as follows .",
    "consider integers @xmath159 prime to @xmath68 , which have the property that the map @xmath160 is a bijection on @xmath33 . since @xmath160 simply permutes the elements of @xmath87",

    "furthermore , @xmath162 is equivalent ( as a mapping on @xmath33 ) to any @xmath163 with @xmath164 .",
    "thus the basic idea is to find some @xmath159 so that the remainders of @xmath165 are all small , yielding a @xmath48 of small degree , and so @xmath166 .",

    "we wish to view these vectors geometrically as points in @xmath175 , but they are only defined up to equivalence in @xmath176 , so define @xmath177 which gives the smallest norm of any representative of the equivalence class @xmath178 viewed as a point in @xmath175 ( equivalently , @xmath179 gives the distance from @xmath180 to the nearest lattice point in @xmath181 ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath182 since the vectors are all at least @xmath183 apart , the sets @xmath184 are disjoint , so each @xmath185 sits in its own personal box of volume @xmath186 .",
    "we may choose to represent these @xmath113 disjoint sets uniquely in the fundamental domain @xmath187 , which has volume @xmath188 .",
    "therefore we have a total volume of @xmath189 sitting in a volume of @xmath188 ; we conclude that @xmath190 .",
    "note that the modular definition of distance is crucial here ; consider instead @xmath113 points in @xmath191^t$ ] that are @xmath183-separated only in the standard @xmath192 metric .",
    "a volume - packing argument becomes more complicated in this case because the box around a point near the boundary may lie partly outside @xmath191^t$ ] ( it does nt  wrap around \" ) , and so some points do not absorb a full @xmath186 worth of volume from @xmath191^t$ ] .",
    "to finish , we find @xmath193 ( with @xmath194 ) so that @xmath195 and set @xmath196 we have @xmath197 and @xmath159 satisfies @xmath198 .",

    "lemma [ packing ] and its proof are extremely similar in spirit to the argument used by canetti et al . in @xcite .",
    "they also viewed the @xmath113 vectors as points in @xmath187 , but to find a pair of nearby points they partitioned the hypercube into @xmath205 equally - sized sub - cubes and appealed to the pigeonhole principle .",
    "here we were able to avoid this discretization of space which lead to the small asymptotic term appearing in theorem [ d ] , which turns out to be unnecessary .",

    "we now prove the first claim .",
