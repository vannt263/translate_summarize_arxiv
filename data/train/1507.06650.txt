    "the inner @xmath9au of protoplanetary disks is thought to be the region in which most exoplanets form @xcite .",
    "initially , the inner disk likely has a smooth radial distribution of gas and dust that is truncated by the stellar magnetic field at the co - rotation radius , within 0.1au .",
    "from this point , disk material accretes onto the central star through magnetospheric accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , over time , inner disks evolve , and gaps and inner holes frequently develop within a few myr @xcite . some of these gaps may be carved by photo - evaporation @xcite , and others by dynamical clearing by planets coupled with pressure - driven dust migration @xcite .",
    "the evolutionary window available for planet formation is therefore limited by , and linked to , the time scale of inner disk dispersal of a few myr @xcite .",
    "when observing the inner regions of protoplanetary disks and the process of planet formation , a central challenge is that the angular size of these regions is small ( @xmath10 ) , even for the closest star - forming clouds .",
    "further , the gas temperatures in the planet - forming region typically spans @xmath11k , pushing the main observational line tracers into the near- to far - infrared wavelength range .",
    "this leads to the common use of infrared molecular spectroscopy to investigate the properties of inner disk gas .",
    "the co molecule is a ubiquitous and sensitive tracer of gas in protoplanetary disks .",
    "while pure rotational co lines observed by millimeter interferometers trace cold gas extending to the outermost disk regions , co lines from rovibrational transitions at infrared wavelengths are typically excited closer to the central star , where the disk is hotter and exposed to strong infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation fields .",
    "surveys of rovibrational co emission from the fundamental ( @xmath12 ) band near 4.7@xmath0 m have demonstrated that the lines probe the properties of inner disks between the magnetospheric accretion radius and the inner 10 au ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "co line profiles , when spatially- and velocity - resolved , have shown a wealth of co isotopologues and complex line profiles , as indicative of a range in excitation conditions and of physically distinct emission components @xcite .",
    "emission from @xmath13co @xmath14=1 - 0 and @xmath14=2 - 1 lines is strong enough to be detected in the majority of gas - rich disks , demonstrating that co is often vibrationally excited . in the innermost disk",
    ", co can be efficiently excited by ir photons from the stellar radiation and the local @xmath0m - size hot dust through ir pumping ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "detection of higher vibrational lines in some disks implies vibrational temperatures that are several times larger than the rotational temperatures , providing evidence for the radiative cascade from pumping of directly uv - irradiated co gas @xcite .",
    "detection of rarer isotopologues , including @xmath15co that is commonly seen in its @xmath14=1 - 0 transitions , has been usually attributed to large column densities of co gas found in young disks .",
    "recent analyses of velocity - resolved co rovibrational emission in one protoplanetary disk found that the @xmath14=1 - 0 lines are a superposition of a broad ( fwhm @xmath16kms@xmath17 ) and a narrow ( fwhm @xmath18kms@xmath17 ) components @xcite .",
    "@xcite found evidence for similarly broad and narrow co components in @xmath19 more embedded disks , and found that , while the two components are blended in @xmath13co @xmath14=1 - 0 lines , only the broad component contributes to the @xmath13co @xmath14=2 - 1 lines , while the @xmath15co lines are dominated by the narrow component . in this paper , we systematically apply a spectral decomposition analysis to high resolution ( @xmath20 ) spectra of a sample of @xmath21 protoplanetary disks , to test the hypothesis that co rovibrational emission in protoplanetary disks may generally be described by two distinct components in velocity and excitation : specifically , a _ narrow component _ , or nc , and a distinctly _ broad component _ , or bc .",
    "the decomposition allows us to estimate both the location and excitation temperature of the emitting co gas .",
    "while most disks in the sample do show two distinct co components that get colder at larger disk radii , some show only narrow emission lines and signatures of having cleared - out inner disk regions .",
    "together , this dataset reveals a sequence of inner disk dispersal across a wide range of stellar masses , from 0.3 to 3@xmath22 .",
    "the disks sample includes 37 disks with 4.7@xmath0 m spectra obtained with the cryogenic infrared echelle spectrometer ( crires , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the very large telescope ( vlt ) of the european southern observatory ( eso ) , as part of the eso large program 179.c-0151 @xcite .",
    "further , one spectrum was added from program 093.c-0432 , providing an additional epoch of data for a disk around the variable star exlup @xcite .",
    "the original survey included disks mostly around young solar - mass stars ( m@xmath23 m@xmath24 , t tauri stars ) as well as some around intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath25 m@xmath26 m@xmath24 , mostly herbig ae / be stars ) .",
    "the disks were also selected to cover a range of evolutionary phases , from the early stages when the disks are still embedded in diffuse envelopes to the clearing stages of transitional disks .",
    "for this paper , we selected those disks with spectra that show co lines in emission , indicative of the presence of warm co gas in the inner part of the disk .",
    "the sample includes 30 t tauri disks and 7 herbig disks ; 2 disks have been observed to have diffuse envelopes , and 7 disks are known to be transitional ( see table [ tab : incl ] ) .",
    "all spectra were reduced using procedures described in @xcite , and were already presented in several papers , providing general overviews as well as more detailed studies of various subsamples @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out between 2007 and 2010 , but consistent instrumental parameters were maintained to ensure homogeneity of the data .",
    "the slit width was @xmath27 , providing a spectral resolution of @xmath28kms@xmath17 , which is generally confirmed by measured widths of narrow atmospheric absorption lines .",
    "early - type telluric standard stars were observed at similar airmasses to the science targets ( typically within 0.1 difference ) to allow an accurate telluric correction .",
    "the observations were generally obtained using the crires adaptive optics correction .",
    "the four crires detectors provide a combined instantaneous spectral coverage of @xmath29@xmath0 m .",
    "the observing strategy targeted the @xmath13co rovibrational p - branch lines in several non - contiguous settings , with at least one centered between 4.65 and 4.77@xmath0 m ( see figure [ fig : 5um spectrum ] ) .",
    "additionally , a spectral setting covering wavelengths up to 5.0@xmath0 m was obtained for most targets .",
    "the crires spectra do not provide continuous coverage due to gaps from detector chips and the telluric absorption from atmospheric co lines doppler - shifted from the targeted lines depending on the month of observation . in some cases ,",
    "the spectra were repeated by applying a small shift to the central wavelength or taken in different months of the year to compensate for those effects and provide a more complete spectral sampling ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this strategy was adopted to obtain complete velocity - resolved co line profiles .",
    "in this section we describe the methodology applied to the analysis of crires spectra , while comparison of our results to previous work and discussion are provided in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "we apply a spectral decomposition algorithm , which essentially consists of the following three basic steps .",
    "_ step 1 _ : :    high signal - to - noise profiles of @xmath13co    @xmath14=1 - 0 and @xmath14=2 - 1 emission are built by    stacking multiple lines from different rotational levels .",
    "_ step 2 _ : :    the stacked line profiles are split into two ( broad ; bc and narrow ;    nc ) components by scaling the @xmath13co    @xmath14=2 - 1 profile to match the wings of the    @xmath13co @xmath14=1 - 0 profile , and then    subtracting it .",
    "this step reveals if the emission is made of a single    ( sc ) rather than of two components ( bc and nc , figure [ fig : multi - comp    analysis ] ) .",
    "_ step 3 _ : :    the line widths and the vibrational @xmath3    ratios are then measured for each detected component .    this procedure is applied to each co spectrum in our sample .",
    "the first two steps are described in sections [ sec : ana1 ] and [ sec : ana2 ] .",
    "the third step provides the data used to find two empirical relations that probe the properties of inner disks ( sections [ sec : ana3 ] and [ sec : ana4 ] ) .",
    "we build high signal - to - noise co line profiles for each science target by stacking several transitions observed in the 4.7@xmath0 m spectra .",
    "nominally , the maximum spectral coverage obtained in this survey includes ro - vibrational co transitions from p(1)p(32 ) for @xmath13co @xmath14=1 - 0 , p(1)p(26 ) and r(0)r(6 ) for @xmath13co @xmath14=2 - 1 , and p(1)p(23 ) and r(0)r(15 ) for @xmath15co @xmath14=1 - 0 . in practice",
    ", the number of transitions available for each disk depends on the spectral coverage obtained for individual targets and on the gaps caused by detector chips and telluric absorption , which in turn depends on the time of year of a given observation . for stacking and averaging line profiles",
    ", we use the lines that are most commonly available , which have similar integrated flux , and which are not significantly blended with other transitions .",
    "these criteria preserve both the line flux and shape in the stacked profiles , and enforce homogeneity in the analysis method for the entire disk sample .",
    "note that , within the relatively narrow spectral range @xmath30 m , lines out of a given vibrational level have very similar fluxes and excitation energies ( within 10 - 30% ) and line profiles depend only very weakly on the rotational quantum number ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for high rotational quantum numbers",
    ", this may no longer be true ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "given these constraints , the @xmath13co @xmath14=1 - 0 lines that are most suitable for stacking are those between p(7 ) and p(12 ) , while the @xmath13co @xmath14=2 - 1 lines are those between p(3 ) and p(6 ) . as for the @xmath15co lines , several",
    "can typically be used over the entire spectrum , where not blended with @xmath13co .",
    "each line is normalized to its local continuum , re - sampled on a common velocity grid , and the stacked line profiles are built by weighted average of the pixel values from the individual transitions . while the stacked @xmath14=2 - 1 line profiles typically have continuous spectral sampling , @xmath14=1 - 0 lines often have spectral gaps on one side due to the counterpart telluric absorption lines at the doppler velocity of the target at the time of observation ( see for instance the gap on the red side of the @xmath14=1 - 0 line in figure [ fig : multi - comp analysis ] ) . in some disks ( cw tau , doar 24e s , ht lup , vssg 1 ) , an absorption component is present on top of @xmath13co emission in the @xmath14=1 - 0 lines .",
    "this is typically due to absorption from unrelated foreground gas @xcite . in these targets , we exclude pixels affected by the absorption component from the stacked profiles and further analysis .",
