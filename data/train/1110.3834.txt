    "the most crucial information to unravel the mechanism of pairing is the structure of the superconducting ( sc ) gap function , a measure of the amplitude and the phase of electron pairs .",
    "although the sc - gap function of conventional phonon - mediated ( attractive pairing interaction ) superconductors has the same sign all over the @xmath2space ( @xmath3wave symmetry ) , that of spin - fluctuation mediated ( repulsive pairing interaction ) superconductors , within the weak to intermediate coupling scenario,@xcite is expected to exhibit a sign reversal between the fermi momenta connected by the characteristic ` hot - spot ' wave vector @xmath4 of spin - fluctuations.@xcite as a consequence of the sign reversal , nodal planes in which the sc gap vanishes should exist in @xmath5 space .",
    "if such nodal planes intersect the fermi surface ( fs ) , as in @xmath1wave cuprate , nodal quasiparticle states emerge in the low - energy spectra . however , if the fs consists of small pockets and do not touch the nodal line , as @xmath6 pairing in iron - pnictide and single layer iron - chalogenides@xcite or @xmath7-wave pairing in double layered iron - selenide ( fe@xmath8se@xmath8),@xcite develop despite a sign reversal of the pairing . therefore , to precisely establish an unconventional pairing symmetry and",
    "separate it from a conventional @xmath3wave , the relative sign of the sc gap on the fs must be established .",
    "the magnetic resonance mode develops in the sc state and was shown theoretically to arise from the sign - flip of the sc gap at the ` hot - spot'.@xcite however , there are other theories which also reproduce the resonance mode without the requirement of sign change of the sc gap.@xcite alternative and important new spectroscopy comes from the quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) pattern , measured by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , which in principle visualizes all possible elastic scattering vectors .",
    "it therefore can distinguish the sign - changing ` hot - spot ' vectors by studying its evolution with varying magnetic field.@xcite magnetic field breaks the time - reversal symmetry of the sc quasiparticles and thus illuminate those scattering vectors which scatter quasiparticles of same pairing phase , thanks to the remarkable properties of the bogolyubov coherence factors.@xcite these observations can be questioned based on at least two arguments : ( 1 ) magnetic field induced vortex states drastically redistribute the spectral weight across the ` bright - spots ' on the constant energy surface , making this procedure complicated ; ( 2 ) a magnetic impurity always carries a scalar potential which allows simultaneous scattering of quasiparticles of opposite pairing phase.@xcite we show in this paper that the ins and qpi maps complement each other and allow determination of the relative phase .",
    "thus , we propose , a comparative study between the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) spectra and the qpi pattern , taken _ together _ , can be a viable tool to quantitatively and unambiguously determine the relative sign of the sc gap .",
    "our approach is based on a very simple observation : both the ins and the qpi patterns arise from the similar scattering of the bogoliubov quasiparticles , forming cooper pairs ( inelastic and elastic scatterings , respectively ) and thus their observed dispersions , @xmath9s , must have an one - to - one relationship in these two spectroscopies . in ins spectra , a scattering @xmath0 vector will be observed if it connects two quasiparticle states at @xmath10 and @xmath11 at which @xmath12\\ne{\\rm sgn}\\bigl[\\delta_{{\\bf k}_f}\\bigr]$ ] and thus its energy scale will be determined by @xmath13 .",
    "the same vector will only appear in the qpi spectra if @xmath14 , because qpi probes elastic scattering .",
    "the comparison between the ins and the qpi maps can therefore emphasize the regions of momentum space with opposite sign of the gap function , connected by scattering momenta .",
    "this emphasis can be further facilitated by studying the magnetic field dependence of the qpi maps .",
    "such a comparative study has proven to give valuable information about the pairing symmetry in cuprates.@xcite    _ iron - pnictide:- _ in the case of iron - pnictide superconductors , however , the presence of multiple bands at the fermi level ( @xmath15 ) and multiple sc gap amplitudes at each bands make the aforementioned analysis much more complicated and exotic . in these compounds ,",
    "the fs consists of disconnected two concentric hole pockets ( namely , @xmath16 and @xmath17 pockets ) and one electron pocket ( @xmath18 pocket ) centered at @xmath19 and m points , respectively .",
    "prominent nesting between the hole pockets and the electron pocket has been shown theoretically to lead to a @xmath20pairing in this family of superconductors.@xcite within this pairing , all the fs pockets possess nodeless and isotropic sc gap , but the sign of the gaps is reversed between the hole pockets and the electron pocket . to complicate the story ,",
    "the two hole pockets acquire very different magnitude of the sc gaps.@xcite therefore , macroscopic geometrical separation of the two phases , as in the cuprate corner - junction experiment , can not be performed in these systems to test the pairing symmetry.@xcite    in our earlier study , we have theoretically shown that because of the two values of the sc gap in two hole - pockets , the ins spectra is split into two energy scales.@xcite furthermore , as the two hole pockets have very different area as a function of doping , the corresponding @xmath0 vectors are also different at these two resonances . here , we show that these ins scattering vectors also appear in two different energy scales of the qpi patterns .",
    "additional scattering vectors between the states of same sign of sc gaps , which were prohibited in ins , appear in qpi .",
    "these results are consistent with stm data on electron doped ba(fe@xmath21co@xmath22)@xmath8as@xmath8 as a function of doping.@xcite furthermore , the evolution of the qpi pattern as a function of magnetic field is also consistent with stm studies in single layer fe(se , te ) superconductors.@xcite    _ fe@xmath8se@xmath8 superconductors:- _ the recent discovery of high-@xmath23 superconductivity in double layered fe@xmath8se@xmath8 based superconductors makes the above story even more interesting and exotic.@xcite the fs in this family of superconductors only hosts electron pockets at m point ( no hole - pocket is present here as in iron - pnictide discussed above ) .",
    "therefore , the leading nesting vector occurs between the two electron pockets which lead to a @xmath7-wave pairing ( @xmath24 in 1 fe unit cell and @xmath25 in 2 fe unit cell notation).@xcite unlike the @xmath7-wave pairing in cuprates , here it gives rise to nodeless and isotropic sc gap on the fs , in consistent with experiments@xcite , but gap function changes sign between the two electron pockets .",
    "we and others @xcite have shown earlier that such a @xmath7-wave pairing leads to a magnetic resonance mode at @xmath4 which is observed later by ins measurements.@xcite    here we show that this ins scattering vector @xmath4 will also show up in the qpi vector at the bias energy equals to the sc gap magnitude .",
    "furthermore , we phenomenologically demonstrate that with the application of the magnetic field , other qpi scattering vectors at which the sc gap do not change sign can be illuminated",
    ". the relative evolution of the qpi maps as a function of magnetic field will provide a valuable test for the relative phase of the sc state on the fs in this family of superconductors .",

    "we extract out very simple equations for these two spectroscopies which can be used with experimental inputs to reconcile them . in sec .",

    "the magnetic field dependence of the qpi map is computed for layered iron - selenide system in sec .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec . v.",
    "a direct correlation between the ins and the qpi spectra can only be made within the bare level in which the same green s functions are involved .",
    "this correspondence therefore would at least qualitatively be correct for dressed greens functions .",
    "in fact , one can again evaluate the green s functions for the filled state from arpes spectral weight @xmath26 , as @xmath27 , which is exact for a single band case , but averaged over orbital indices in a multiband system . in a multiband superconductor ,",

    "the matrix - element can be important for shaping the spectral weight distributions for multiband case .",
    "nevertheless , the relative intensity of the scattering vectors is determined by the nesting conditions and the sc gap amplitude for elastic scattering .",
    "in addition , a scattering matrix - element , @xmath45 , appears due to the coherence factors , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , of the bogolyubov quasiparticles which is sensitive to the momentum - dependent phase of the sc order parameter and the symmetry of the scattering potential , @xmath48.@xcite the green s function is expressed in terms of the spectral weight as @xmath49 .",

    "<S> we present a phenomenological calculation of the quasiparticle - interference ( qpi ) pattern and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) spectra in iron - pnictide and layered iron - selenide compounds by using materials specific band - structure and superconducting ( sc ) gap properties . as both the qpi and </S>",
    "<S> the ins spectra arise due to scattering of the bogolyubov quasiaprticles , they exhibit an one - to - one correspondence of the scattering vectors and the energy scales . we show that these two spectroscopies complement each other in such a way that a comparative study allows one to extract the quantitative and unambiguous information about the underlying pairing structure and the phase of the sc gap . due to the nodeless and isotropic nature of the sc gaps , both the qpi and ins maps </S>",

    "<S> the results presented , particularly for newly iron - selenide compounds , can be used to test the nodeless @xmath1wave pairing in this class of high temperature superconductors . </S>"
