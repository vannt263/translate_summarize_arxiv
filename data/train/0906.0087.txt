    "since the discovery of quasicrystals ( qcs ) ( shechtman _ et al .",
    "_ , 1984 ) , there has been an up - surge of interest in quasiperiodic tilings with non - crystallographic point symmetries .",
    "archetypes of such tilings in the plane are the ammann - beenker tiling ( grnbaum & shephard , 1987 ; beenker , 1982 ) , the penrose tilings ( grnbaum & shephard , 1987 ; penrose , 1974,1978,1979 ) , and the stampfli square - triangle tilings ( stampfli , 1986 ; baake _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ) , which belong to the octagonal , decagonal , and dodecagonal bravais classes , respectively .",
    "their vertices form a quasiperiodic point set called a quasilattice ( ql ) , which mimics the spatial arrangement of clusters in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) qc . in real qcs , still a far wider variety of cluster arrangements are possible under different compositions and temperatures ( edagawa _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ; edagawa _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "in order to advance our understanding of the real structures , it is therefore necessary to extend our scope for tiling models of qcs and to describe the structures in a more systematic fashion . in the present report ,",
    "we mean by a 2d tiling _ a disjoint covering of the plane by edge sharing copies of a finite number of polygonal prototiles_.    in general , a 2d ql is constructed as a section of a 4d hypercrystal along the plane ( physical space ) , where the hypercrystal is constructed from ` atomic surfaces ' arranged periodically according to the relevant bravais hyperlattice ; each atomic surface extends only along the perpendicular space , which is an orthogonal complement to the physical space .",
    "the global characteristics or , more precisely , the local - isomorphism class of the ql is coded as the size and the shape of the atomic surface(s ) ( de bruijn , 1981 ; mackay , 1982 ; kramer & neri , 1984 ; duneau & katz , 1985 ) .    in constructing 2d qls by the section method , we would practically be restrained to polygonal atomic surfaces . however , certain important structures can not be obtained in this way ; the dodecagonal square - triangle tilings are typical examples which have rather complicated ` fractal ' atomic surfaces ( stampfli , 1986 ; baake _ et al .",
    "_ , 1992 ; smith , 1993 ; cockayne , 1994 ) .",
    "further examples with fractal atomic surfaces can also be found in the literature ( zobetz , 1992 ; godrche _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ; niizeki , 2007a ) .",
    "these structures have been discovered by inflation methods , in which the shapes of atomic surfaces are not given _",
    "a priori_. it is important to note that even for a known atomic surface with a fractal boundary , the computation of the structure by the section method is impractical because minute numerical errors can not be avoided in judging which side of the boundary lies a given point near the boundary .",
    "therefore , the section method does not suit the generation of such a ql , whereas an inflation method can work fine .",
    "so far , a systematic attempt has been made for generating 1d binary tilings by inflation rules ( luck _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ) , revealing that the structures tend to have fractal ( cantor - set like ) atomic surfaces . in more than two dimensions , however , inflation rules for quasiperiodic tilings have been rarely known except for those described above .",
    "this situation is simply caused by a hurdle in finding an inflation rule that does not produce any inconsistency throughout the entire structure .",
    "there is nevertheless some hope at present ; a systematic inflation method for generating qls , i.e. quasiperiodic point sets , in general dimensions has been developed recently ( niizeki , 2008 ) .",
    "let us call the latter method the _ point inflation scheme _",
    "( pis ) and each of its inflation algorithms a _",
    "point inflation rule _ ( pir ) . at this point , however , it should be remembered that a ql does not necessarily provide the vertices of a tiling .    an advantage of employing tiling models for qcs lies in that they enable the entire structure to be decomposed into a finite number of _ prototiles _ , or fundamental structural units .",
    "another possible advantage may lie in their stronger geometrical constraints , which are based on physical reasonings like the avoidance of unrealistic short distances .",
    "the present aim is therefore to develop a new inflation scheme for generating quasiperiodic tilings . as in the case of archetypal tilings in the plane",
    ", inflation rules should proceed in the following steps : 1 ) an expansion of a tiling and 2 ) a division of the expanded tiles into tiles of the original size .",
    "bear in mind that the expanded tiles can be divided in an arbitrarily way as far as the set of prototiles is maintained .    in the present report , it is proposed that the division of the tiles is generalized with the help of a point decoration process . the point decoration might simply be defined by a pir , but this can not prevent excess points from being generated in general .",
    "one needs to remove a part of the resulting point set so that the remaining points would be the vertex set of a tiling .",
    "wherefore , the point decoration can be defined instead by taking an appropriate subset of the set generated by a pir . in other words ,",
    "the pir is used to obtain the candidate positions for the decoration , where only a part of it is adopted .",
    "the present scheme turns out to be useful for discovering unknown tilings . for the sake of a self - contained presentation ,",
    "the following arguments are confined to the decagonal case .",
    "furthermore , the edges of any tiling to be considered are all given by one of the basic unit vectors , @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , which will be defined in sec.[sec2 ] .",
    "sec.[sec2 ] is devoted to mathematical preliminaries , in which the decagonal bravais module @xmath2 is introduced ; it is a projection of the 4d decagonal lattice onto the 2d physical space .",
    "the new scheme for generating decagonal tilings is presented in sec.[sec3 ] . in sec.[sec4 ] , the present scheme is exercised and two new families of decagonal tilings are obtained ; one is quarternary and the other ternary .",
    "the atomic surfaces of the new tilings are presented in sec.[sec5 ] .",
    "in particular , for the ternary tilings , the atomic surfaces with fractal boundaries are derived geometrically as the fixed sets of the dual maps associated with the relevant inflation rules .",
    "a statistical analysis is performed for the ternary tilings in sec.[sec6 ] . after presenting further remarks in sec.[sec7 ]",
    ", conclusions are given in the final section .",
    "let us define the quasicrystallographic axes for a decagonal ql by the ten unit vectors @xmath3 , @xmath4 with @xmath5 and @xmath6 , pointing at the vertices of a regular decagon centered on the origin .",
    "among the ten vectors , only four are linearly independent with respect to integral coefficients .",
    "a conventional set of basis vectors is introduced as @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , pointing at four vertices of a pentagon from the origin , where the fifth vertex @xmath9 is left unused because it can be represented by the four bases ; @xmath10 .",
    "the basis set generates a z - module of rank four called the decagonal bravais module , denoted by the symbol @xmath2 .",
    "remember that the point group of @xmath2 is the dihedral group @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2 has an important property of scaling invariance @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the golden mean ( niizeki , 1989a ) .",
    "is called the pisot unit in the algebraic theory of bravais modules . for the octagonal or the dodecagonal cases , it takes @xmath14 or @xmath15 , respectively . ]    the decagonal bravais hyperlattice @xmath16 is defined in a 4d euclidean hyperspace @xmath17 , and it is generated by the primitive basis vectors @xmath18 ( @xmath19 0,1,2 , and 3 ) , where @xmath20 ( niizeki , 1989a ; yamamoto , 1996 ) and @xmath21 is an arbitrary scale factor satisfying @xmath22 .",
    "the point group @xmath23 of @xmath16 is isomorphic to the dihedral group @xmath11 .",
    "the 2d physical space @xmath24 is an irreducible subspace of @xmath17 with respect to @xmath23 , and it is inclined against @xmath16 in an incommensurate fashion .",
    "the orthogonal projection of @xmath16 onto @xmath24 gives nothing but the decagonal bravais module @xmath2 .",
    "the 2d perpendicular space @xmath25 is defined as the orthogonal complement to @xmath26 in @xmath17 ; that is , @xmath27 .",
    "then the hyperlattice @xmath16 can be projected onto @xmath28 as well , generating another z - module , @xmath29 .",
    "since the orthogonal projections from @xmath16 to both @xmath2 and @xmath30 are bijections , one can introduce a natural bijection @xmath31 between the z - modules ; @xmath32 .",
    "we confine ourselves to the case when the vertex set @xmath33 of a tiling @xmath34 is a subset of the bravais module @xmath2 . in the ordinary cut - and - projection method ( de bruijn , 1981 ; mackay , 1982 ; kramer & neri , 1984 ; duneau & katz , 1985 ) , @xmath33 is generated as the orthogonal projection of @xmath35 , a cut of @xmath16 within a strip along e@xmath36 , onto e@xmath36 .",
    "the cross section of the strip , @xmath37 , is equivalent to the atomic surface in the section method .",
    "the image of @xmath33 in @xmath25 is denoted as @xmath38 . in general",
    ", @xmath39 is a dense subset of the atomic surface @xmath40 , which on the other hand should be included in the closure of @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath41 . is a compact ( i.e. , closed and bounded ) set in e@xmath42 , hence , @xmath43 . in this paper , however , more general language is sought so that a part of the boundary @xmath44 can be absent from @xmath40 while fulfilling the glueing condition as explained in the text for the case of the rph tilings , see fig.[fig8 ] . ]",
    "in the pis ( niizeki , 2008 ) , a pir is formulated as a set map @xmath45 that acts on an arbitrary subset @xmath46 of @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath45 proceeds by expanding @xmath46 by a certain ratio @xmath47 and subsequently placing a copy of a certain motif @xmath48 centered on every vertex .",
    "the ratio @xmath49 can take any natural power of the pisot unit @xmath50 ( the golden mean ) associated with @xmath2 , so that @xmath51 remains to be a subset of @xmath2 .",
    "the motif @xmath52 is a bounded set with a finite number of points comprised of one or more shells , each of which is an orbit of a point with respect to the point group @xmath11 .",
    "one can put the procedure in a simple form as @xmath53 , in which the @xmath54 symbol implies @xmath55 .",
    "note that the resultant ql would have the point group @xmath11 .",
    "the atomic surface of a ql generated by the pis is identified as the unique attractor ( hutchinson , 1981 ) of the dual set map @xmath56 that acts in the perpendicular space ; @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the algebraic conjugate of @xmath49 and @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath56 is nothing but an iterated function system ( ifs ) , which is a common technique to generate fractal objects ( falconer , 1990 ) .",
    "indeed , the atomic surfaces of many qls generated by the pis have fractal boundaries .",
    "various planar qls have been found by the pis ( niizeki , 2008 ) , which has also been applied to the case of icosahedral qls ( fujita & niizeki , 2008 ) .",
    "certain qls can derive a tiling if the points are connected by uncrossed edges of a unit length , where the tiles are the regions bounded by these edges .",
    "let us call this property the _ unit connectivity _ ( uc ) of the point sets .",
    "if a point set obtained by successively applying a pir has the uc property , the pir can be translated into an inflation rule for the tiling ; an expansion of the tiles followed by their division into the original tiles .",
    "the division rules of the tiles are determined by the generated points in the tiles . in general , however , undesirable short distances prevent the generated point sets to be translated into tilings .",
    "such redundancies can be discarded only by introducing an elimination step at each iteration to take an appropriate subset which fulfills the uc property",
    ". then the expanded tiles are divided properly .",
    "we call the new inflation process a generalized point process ( gpp ) . in the gpp ,",
    "the role of the pir is to generate the _ candidate positions for the vertices of a tiling_.    for now , the uc property is required by the point set at every iteration of a gpp .",
    "a gpp for decagonal tilings is formally given by the following steps : step ( i ) an expansion of the tiling by the ratio @xmath49 , where @xmath49 is a natural power of @xmath50 ( the golden mean ) , and step ( ii ) the decoration of every expanded tile by points , where the positions of the points should originate from @xmath2 and are assumed to be determined uniquely by the shape of the expanded tile as well as those of its adjacent neighbours . in practice , candidate positions for the points of decoration are generated by a pir , then an appropriate subset is taken to determine the division of the tiles .",
    "note that there are degrees of freedom for the choice of the point decoration provided that it is determined uniquely within the first adjacent neighbors and that the set of prototiles is maintained .",
    "it is this generality that allows us to produce a broad class of new quasiperiodic tilings .",
    "the degrees of freedom can be promoted further by allowing the decoration to depend on farther neighbors .",
    "however , this would complicate the algorithm and will not be considered .",
    "several decagonal tilings are generated by the gpp scheme .",
    "all the tilings presented below obey the uc property , in which the vertices are connected through the ten basic unit vectors @xmath0 ( @xmath60 ) forming the edges of the tiles .",
    "any vertex can therefore be written as @xmath61 , or alternatively it can be indexed as @xmath62 $ ] .      the present tiling has been already reported ( niizeki , 2008 ) as one of the simplest decagonal tilings that can be generated by the pis .",
    "the scaling ratio of the relevant pir is @xmath63 , while the motif @xmath52 consists of two shells @xmath64\\rangle$ ] and @xmath65\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath66 is the orbit of the point @xmath67 with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "in addition to the four prototiles , i.e. , the 36@xmath68 rhombus ( r ) , the regular pentagon ( p ) , the crown ( c ) , and the pentacle star ( s ) , of the pentagonal penrose tiling ( p1 ) ( penrose , 1974 ; grnbaum & shephard , 1987 ) , it has an additional prototile , namely the barrel shaped hexagon ( h ) .",
    "this tiling is called the _ para - penrose tiling _ by niizeki ( 2008 ) . in a single iteration ,",
    "these tiles are expanded by the ratio @xmath69 and then a copy of @xmath52 is placed on every vertex ; see fig.[fig1](a ) .",
    "one finds that each expanded tile is uniquely decorated with the points of @xmath52 s within its border .",
    "as the new points are connected with unit edges , the expanded tile is divided into tiles of the original size , whereas in the vicinity of the boundary the tiles can be shared with the neighboring expanded tiles . in particular , when dividing an expanded p- or h - tile , segments near the boundary can be attributed to different kinds of tiles .",
    "this means that the division rule is not unique within the expanded tile itself .",
    "still , it turns out to be unique within the first adjacent neighbors as one can readily check in fig.[fig1](b ) .",
    "therefore , the present pir satisfies the requisites for a gpp .",
    "the pir for the para - penrose tiling can be slightly altered by removing a generated vertex inside every expanded c - tile at the symmetrical position .",
    "obviously this does not affect the uniqueness of the decoration within every expanded prototile , and the resulting point set is shown to satisfy the uc property . as a consequence ,",
    "the combination of an s - tile and a p - tile ( s - p complex ) lying in the center of every expanded c - tile turns into one of a c - tile and an h - tile ( c - h complex ) .",
    "since the s - prototile may no longer appear except in the center of an expanded s - tile , it is a marginal one in the present case ; that is , an iteration of the above gpp will generate a quaternary tiling with r- , p- , h- , and c - prototiles as shown in fig.[fig2](a ) .",
    "the division rule of every expanded tile depends on its first adjacent neighbors as in the case of the para - penrose tiling .",
    "there are yet different ways to remove a vertex in an expanded c - tile without affecting the set of prototiles .",
    "let us consider a gear - shaped complex ( or a g - complex ) , including an s - tile in the center and five adjacent p - tiles ( see fig.[fig3](a ) ) , lying on the bottom of the expanded c - tile .",
    "one or two of its five internal vertices can be removed so that the g - complex is to be divided in different manners . by removing one vertex , the g - complex",
    "is divided into one h- , one c- , and four p - tiles ( fig.[fig3](b ) , left ) .",
    "there are five possible orientations , one of which has been taken in the preceding paragraph .",
    "two other orientations are used in fig.[fig2](b ) and ( c ) , while the remaining two are their mirror images .",
    "removing two internal vertices offers yet different ways to divide the g - complex .",
    "of the five possible orientations , the only one without breaking the mirror symmetry is used in fig.[fig2](d ) .",
    "two other choices are shown in fig.[fig2](e ) and ( f ) , while the remaining two are their mirror images . by removing two vertices ,",
    "the g - complex is divided into one r- , two h- , and three p - tiles ( fig.[fig3](b ) , right ) .",
    "we have constructed in total ten gpps for tilings with the identical set of four prototiles .",
    "recall that the eight gpps without mirror symmetry would generate chiral tilings .",
    "if the ten gpps are applied in a mixed and arbitrary order , infinitely many tilings can be generated .",
    "furthermore , if different gpps are allowed to be applied at different locations at the same time , the possibilities become illimitable .",
    "let us argue how the c - prototile can be excluded from the prototiles of rphc tilings .",
    "consider a turban - shaped complex ( or a t - complex ) composed of a c - tile and two adjacent p - tiles in an rphc tiling .",
    "a t - complex is associated to every 36@xmath68 angle of the expanded r- and c - tiles .",
    "the t - complex can be decomposed into three tiles , r- , p- , and h - tiles , by removing one of the two inner vertices , thereby breaking the mirror symmetry ; see fig.[fig3](c ) .",
    "if all the t - complexes are ( re-)divided in such a way , an rphc - tiling turns into a tiling which does not include any c - tile .",
    "the two different ways to divide the t - complex are mirror images of one another , where _ left_- and _ right_-handed chiralities are associated with them .",
    "it is tempting to apply either one of the chiral rules for dividing all the t - complexes ; then the two gpps for both chiralities are obtained .",
    "these gpps maintain the set of the prototiles , r , p , and h. the left - handed gpp is shown in fig.[fig4 ] , the repetition of which generates a tiling shown in fig.[fig5](a ) .",
    "the mirror images of these figures corresponds to the right - handed counterparts .",
    "note that the point decorations within the expanded prototiles are not uniquely determined in this case , but they are unique within the first adjacent shell .",
    "the decoration uniquely determines the division of the expanded prototiles .",
    "the two gpps may be applied in an arbitrary order , resulting in an infinite number of rph tilings .",
    "a tiling shown in fig.[fig5](b ) is an outcome of an alternate repetition of the right- and the left - handed gpps , where the final gpp is the left - handed one . in both of the tilings shown in fig.[fig5 ] , a spiral pattern associated with the left - handed chirality",
    "can be easily recognized .",
    "again , much greater possibilities exist if the two gpps are allowed to be applied at different locations at the same time .",
    "the atomic surface of a quasiperiodic tiling @xmath34 is closely connected with the global characteristics of the structure .",
    "it can be inferred by projecting the vertices of a patch of @xmath34 containing sufficient number of vertices onto the perpendicular space , e@xmath42 .",
    "this is done in fig.[fig6 ] for the six rphc tilings and in fig.[fig7 ] for the two rph tilings , respectively .",
    "the convex hulls of all these atomic surfaces are the regular decagon whose vertices are given by @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) , corresponding to the atomic surface of the penrose p1 tiling . however , different types of erosion are observed near the boundaries even for tilings with the same set of prototiles .",
    "the symmetry of an atomic surface reflects that of the relevant tiling ; all the atomic surfaces except the two with the mirror symmetric gpps ( fig.[fig6](a ) and ( d ) ) have the lower point symmetry with the cyclic group @xmath72 . for each case",
    ", the erosion reveals a complicated fractal patterns . in particular , the three atomic surfaces that are shown in fig.[fig6](a),(c ) , and ( e ) exhibit hierarchical holes in the boundary regions .",
    "the rest of the atomic surfaces maintain the disc - like topology .",
    "recall that , for a ql generated by the pis , the atomic surface is simply identified as the unique attractor of the dual set map @xmath73 in e@xmath42 , where @xmath58 denotes the algebraic conjugate of @xmath49 and @xmath74 any subset of e@xmath42 ( niizeki , 2008 ) . for a tiling generated by the gpp scheme ,",
    "on the other hand , the dual set map is associated with the determination of the candidate positions , from which a certain subset should be eliminated .",
    "the elimination is represented in e@xmath42 as a subtraction of unnecessary parts from @xmath75 . in the following",
    ", the latter process is presented for the rph tilings , in which case geometrical rules to determine the atomic surfaces are identified . however , since such geometrical rules are not easy to generalize , the case of the rphc tilings will be left open .",
    "the pir for the para - penrose tiling given in subsec.[subsecpp ] gives @xmath76\\rangle,\\langle[1010]\\rangle\\}$ ] and @xmath77 for the dual set map @xmath78 .",
    "the fixed set of @xmath78 , which is a moth - eaten version of the regular decagon ( niizeki , 2008 ) , is the corresponding atomic surface .",
    "the small part that is left out from the decagonal atomic surface corresponds to a portion of concave vertices of c - tiles and s - tiles , resulting in the emergence of h - tiles in the para - penrose tiling .    in order to obtain the atomic surfaces for the rph tilings",
    ", a subtraction process needs to be combined with the dual set map at each iteration . in fig.[fig8 ] , the initial polygon @xmath79 is defined as a decagonal star , which is known to be the atomic surface of a non - chiral rph tiling ( papadopolos & kasner , 2003 ) .",
    "it is transformed by the dual set map to @xmath80 .",
    "the subtraction process for the chiral gpps ( subsec.[subsecrph ] ) can be understood as a carving process near the boundary of @xmath81 .",
    "note that five strips are superposed on the next figure , while five more strips can be superposed up - side - down but are suppressed .",
    "these strips are cut by the boundary of @xmath81 , while the two ends of each strip do not coincide through a translation .",
    "accordingly , within each cut of the strips , two points can lie on a line parallel to the strip with the distance @xmath82 .",
    "this leads to an excessive appearance of short distance @xmath83 in e@xmath84 and hence to the existence of c - tiles .",
    "it turns out that for an rph - tiling no such pair of points is allowed to exist within a single strip .",
    "therefore , either or both ends of each cut must be carved so that they coincide through @xmath82-translations .    the carving process for the left- or right - handed gpp is simply to carve a single end only . as shown in fig.[fig8 ] , five strips are arranged to form a pentacle star , which can be traced either clock - wise or anti - clock - wise .",
    "let us fix that the pentacle should be traced clock - wise .",
    "then for the left - handed gpp , the first end of each strip encountered while tracing the pentacle should be carved so that it coincides with the translate of the second end .",
    "these two ends fulfill the gluing condition ; namely , if a point on one end is taken into account , the corresponding point on the other end should be discarded .",
    "the carving process for all the ten strips results in a new polygon @xmath85 , which is the atomic surface of another rph - tiling ( chiral in this case ) .",
    "the carving process is denoted as @xmath86 , while the right - handed counterpart is denoted as @xmath87 in which case the opposite end of each strip is to be carved .",
    "the atomic surface of an rph - tiling generated by the gpp scheme can be obtained by repeatedly applying @xmath88 and/or @xmath89 . in the example shown in fig.[fig8 ] , only the left - handed process @xmath88 is used . in general , the subtraction process @xmath90 associated with the removal of unnecessary points from the candidate positions can be rather complicated . at present , the author has been able to identify @xmath90 only for the chiral rph - tilings .",
    "the inflation matrices are introduced in the following to analyze the statistics of the rph tilings . for each chirality",
    ", there are six types of tiles that are divided differently , as can be seen in fig.[fig4 ] . in order to define the inflation matrix ,",
    "the generated tiles need to be classified further into six types , so that their numbers can be counted in each expanded tile .",
    "note , however , that the latter task depends on which chirality is to be used in the next iteration . in fig.[fig4 ] , some of the small tiles are assigned different letters according to the chirality of the next gpp .",
    "there are four pairs of chiralities for the two successive iterations , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "it is sufficient to consider two particular cases , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , since the other cases are mere mirror images of the former two ; the latters have the same inflation matrices as the formers .    in the case",
    "@xmath91 , the division rules shown in fig.[fig4 ] reveals that the six expanded tiles are divided as @xmath95 where @xmath96 represents the volume of the tile labeled ` @xmath97 ' . in the case",
    "@xmath93 , the corresponding formulae are @xmath98 it follows that the inflation matrices for all the four cases are given by @xmath99 and @xmath100 one can check that the maximal eigenvalues of both @xmath101 and @xmath102 are @xmath103 , corresponding to the rate of volume increase under a single gpp iteration .",
    "the relevant right - eigenvectors are common to the two matrices , reading @xmath104 where the superscript @xmath105 indicates the transposition .",
    "these six components provide the relative area ( volume ) of the tiles labeled ` @xmath106 ' to ` @xmath107 ' .    on the other hand , the left - eigenvectors for the common maximal eigenvalue @xmath103",
    "give the number ratio of the tiles .",
    "for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the relevant left - eigenvectors are @xmath108 respectively .",
    "that the eigenvectors are different might seem troublesome if the two gpps are applied in an arbitrary order .",
    "it turns out , however , that no problem is caused by the difference , since the inflation matrices multiplied by the wrong eigenvectors will just give the right ones , i.e. , @xmath109 it follows that the number ratios of the tiles depend only on the chiralities of the final two iterations .",
    "the above two distributions for the six types of tiles do not cause a difference in the number ratios of the three prototiles , since the sum over components for p - tile or h - tile are common to the two left - eigenvectors .",
    "it follows that the number ratios of the three prototiles in the present rph - tilings are @xmath110 , while the mean volume of the tiles is @xmath83 times that of an h - tile .",
    "the differences in the left - eigenvectors manifest themselves in the statistics of local arrangements of tiles in the relevant tilings .",
    "for instance , the second components of @xmath111 and @xmath112 representing the relative frequencies of p - tiles labeled ` @xmath113 ' are different .",
    "this is manifested in the frequencies of the local centers of five - fold symmetry in the two tilings shown in fig.[fig5 ] ; the difference can be rather significant from the viewpoint of the structural stability as well as the physical properties if these tilings are to be used for modeling physical qcs .",
    "importantly , the difference should also be connected to the boundary shapes of the atomic surfaces , which point will be left for a future investigation though .",
    "there are on the other hand three types of local centers of two - fold symmetry ( niizeki , 1989b ) located ( i ) at the centers of r - tiles labeled ` @xmath106 ' or ` @xmath114 ' , ( ii ) at the centers of h - tiles labeled ` @xmath115 ' , ` @xmath116 ' , or ` @xmath107 ' , and ( iii ) at the mid - edge positions between two adjacent p - tiles both labeled ` @xmath113 ' . the frequencies of these two - fold centers are common to the two cases .",
    "the generality of the gpp scheme is capable of generating a number of unknown quasiperiodic tilings , many of which has a chirality .",
    "let us briefly consider how the structure factor of a chiral tiling looks like . in our examples ,",
    "the breaking of the mirror symmetry is carried by a small part of the atomic surface near the boundary , while the main body of the atomic surface maintains the mirror symmetry .",
    "since the latter part provides the main contribution to the structure factor , the chirality is only manifested in relatively weak bragg peaks .",
    "a structure factor is shown in fig.[fig9 ] for the tiling shown in fig.[fig5](a ) , assuming a point scatterer on every vertex .    in the gpp scheme",
    ", the removal of unnecessary points from the given candidates for the point decoration forms a critical step .",
    "this makes the gpp the most general and robust technique for generating decagonal tilings .",
    "furthermore , the application of the basic idea to the octagonal as well as the dodecagonal cases is straightforward .",
    "indeed , for most of the known tilings , whether the atomic surfaces are polygonal or fractal , inflation rules can be re - phrased as gpps , i.e. the combination of an expansion step and a point decoration step .",
    "let us consider the particular case of the dodecagonal square - triangle tilings . in this case ,",
    "each of the vertices in the expanded tiling is decorated by a three shell motif @xmath52 , comprising the origin , an inner hexagon , and an outer dodecagon .",
    "the hexagon can take two different orientations , which can be chosen at random ( smith , 1993 ; ghler , 1988 ) or according to a deterministic rule ; for instance , the local coordination can be used to fix the orientation ( hermisson _ et al . _ ,",
    "one can see a similarity of the situation to the case of decagonal tilings that are presented in this paper .",
    "different tilings that are generated by applying different gpps in different orders are all members of the random tiling ensemble with the same set of prototiles .",
    "they are likely to have energies very close to each other , so do they have similar statistical weights .",
    "since they form a deterministic subset of the relevant random tiling ensemble , the relevant contribution to the entropy is called the ` deterministic entropy ' , a term coined by a. p. smith ( smith , 1993 ) .",
    "either of the left - handed and the right - handed gpps for the rph tilings is defined by exclusively applying one of the two division rules for the t - complex ; see fig.[fig3](c ) .",
    "one readily recognizes that these two division rules are mutually connected through a phason flip involving three tiles .",
    "accordingly , the rph tilings embrace an abundance of flipping sites .",
    "this has a significant implication when a physical realization of a similar structure is to be considered , since the phason degrees of freedom must play an important role in the structural stabilization .",
    "one should also bear in mind that the same kind of phason flips has been observed _ in situ _ in a @xmath117-al - cu - co qc at 1123 k with a transmission electron microscope ( edagawa _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "a general inflation scheme for generating decagonal quasiperiodic tilings has been proposed . in the new scheme , inflation rules",
    "are practically comprised of three steps : an expansion with the ratio @xmath49 , a decoration of every vertex by a finite motif @xmath52 , and an elimination of unnecessary points by local rules . at every iteration",
    ", the resulting point set should be unit - connective and form the vertex set of a tiling .",
    "since the point decoration process can be readily generalized , various new tilings are expected to be found .",
    "the usefulness of the present scheme has been demonstrated by generating several new decagonal tilings , among which the family of ternary tilings has been analyzed in detail .",
    "the concept can be exported not only to the octagonal and dodecagonal cases , but also to the icosahedral cases ( including p- , f- , and i - type bravais classes ) , for which only a few tilings have been known .                    ) .",
    "for instance , a p - tile labeled ` ( @xmath113 , @xmath118 ) ' implies that it is classified into the @xmath113-subclass if the next gpp is left - handed while into the @xmath118-subclass if the next gpp is right - handed , where the bar indicates the mirror inversion .",
    "a mutually inverted pair is denoted by a starred label ; that is , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "the label ` @xmath121 ' ( i.e. ` @xmath122 ' ) for each r - tile is suppressed merely for the reason of space .",
    "tiles with the label ` @xmath107 ' only appear if the two successive gpps have opposite chiralities , while tiles with the label ` @xmath115 ' ( or ` @xmath116 ' ) only appear if the same gpp is applied successively.,width=302 ]      ( f ) : the atomic surfaces for the rphc tilings in fig.[fig2](a)@xmath123(f ) , respectively .",
