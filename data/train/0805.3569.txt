    "understanding the feasibility of multi - hop wireless networks has been the subject of a great deal of research . in this",
    "regard , much mathematical and practical consideration has been devoted to studying the capacity of such networks . in the seminal work of gupta and kumar @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that under the assumption of point - to - point communication , the per - node asymptotic capacity decays at least as fast @xmath10 for a _ dense network _ with @xmath11 nodes , where the number of nodes approaches infinity within a unit disk or unit sphere .",
    "subsequent studies have shown similar decay for upper - bound on capacity in an _ extended network _",
    ", where the deployment area increases linearly with the number of nodes while the node density remains constant @xcite@xcite@xcite . in such networks ,",
    "besides interference , the radio power decay over large communication distances is another determining factor affecting the communication rate .",
    "the results of @xcite are based on the assumption that the communication between a specific source - destination pair is always deteriorated by the concurrent transmission of the other nodes .",
    "in contrast , cooperative communication can result in considerable capacity gains by discarding this constraint . under this setting ,",
    "the notion of a link is considered as a set of users , encoding and transmitting messages in coordination .",
    "such a communication setting mimics a multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) antenna system @xcite in a distributed fashion , where users act as _ virtual _ antenna arrays cooperating to transmit a message towards the destination .",
    "exploiting the spatial multiplexing gain of mimo is appealing , since mimo communication can result in linear capacity increase as a function of the number of antennas in the high snr regime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ozgur _ et al _ has recently extended this result to _ distributed _ mimo communication @xcite to achieve linear capacity scaling with @xmath11 in a _",
    "dense _ network with constant transmission power , by utilizing a hierarchical communication scheme with single - hop distributed mimo transmission between the source and destination clusters .",
    "however , multi - hop forwarding is essential to the efficiency of large - scale _ extended _ networks .",
    "it remains an open problem to quantify the capacity of multi - hop cooperative communication .",
    "this work represents a step toward this direction .",
    "we extend our results in  @xcite and study the benefit of cooperation in an extended network , by combining peer - node cooperation with multi - hop forwarding to mitigate the path - loss power decay and harness spatial multiplexing gain .",
    "we propose a multi - phase communication scheme based on _ multi - hop _ distributed mimo forwarding among clusters of nodes , where a cluster is a hierarchically organized set of nodes that cooperate simultaneously to transmit a single message vector .",
    "we then derive the network throughput of this communication scheme by considering the optimal cluster size .",
    "we first show that , for a _ regular network _ , where one node is randomly placed within each square of unit area , the network throughput scales as @xmath12 with transmission power requirement of @xmath13 , where @xmath3 is the signal path loss exponent .",
    "we further extend this result to a _ random network _",
    ", where the nodes are uniformly distributed with unit node density , and show that throughput scaling is lower - bounded by @xmath14 with transmission power requirement of @xmath5 .",
    "we finally study a random network with increasing node density and show that if the density @xmath15 follows @xmath7 the throughput scaling is lower - bounded by @xmath16 with power scaling @xmath9 .",
    "the existence of the proposed communication scheme provides a constructive lower bound on the capacity of extended networks with node cooperation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ related ] , we summarize the related work .",
    "section [ model ] details the network model . in section [ outline ]",
    "we explain the three phases of the communication scheme .",
    "section [ cresult ] analytically evaluates each communication phase and presents the overall network capacity .",
    "we extend our results to random networks in section [ numsim ] .",
    "finally , the concluding remarks are given in section [ conc ] .",
    "existing research on the scaling behavior of multi - hop wireless networks can be categorized mainly into two groups .",
    "the first category is concentrated on information - theoretic upper - bounds on the network capacity by using cut - set bounds , and the second category deals with constructive communication schemes which achieve a lower - bound on the capacity .",
    "different topologies such as dense and extended networks have been considered in each category .    _ information theoretic upper - bounds _ : the seminal work @xcite provides both upper - bounds and constructive communication schemes to show that the point - to - point capacity of a dense wireless network is @xmath0 . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the authors derive information theoretic upper - bounds on the network capacity .",
    "these works study the capacity scaling of extended networks and obtain upper - bounds on the capacity by using cut - set bounds .",
    "in particular , xie _ et al _ prove that for environments with path - loss exponent @xmath17 and constant per node power , the expected transport capacity grows at most linearly in the number of nodes , so that for an extended network with uniformly distributed source - destination pairs , the network capacity is @xmath18@xcite .",
    "while in simple multi - hopping , increasing the transmission power does not improve the capacity scaling , jovicic _ et al _ in @xcite show that the upper - bound on the network transport capacity scales linearly with node power .",
    "similar results are shown in @xcite .",
    "their results motivates using the extra degree of freedom provided by the choice of transmission power .",
    "we exploit this in the proposed collaborative scheme to increase the network capacity .",
    "_ constructive communication schemes : _ toumpis _ et al _ in @xcite have proposed a gridding of a unit area network and the use of 9-tdma scheduling to derive the same lower - bound on capacity as @xcite in a more straightforward manner .",
    "they further extend their model to consider the effect of node mobility and fading on the capacity .",
    "et al _ in @xcite have closed the previous gap between the capacity in _ arbitrary _ and _ random _ networks .",
    "they use percolation theory to show that the sum capacity of their proposed communication scheme scales as @xmath0 .",
    "none of the above utilizes cooperative transmission .",
    "there has been much research into node cooperation in the context of single - source , single - destination , and @xmath11 relays .",
    "for example , gastpar _ et al _ in @xcite show an achievable rate scaling of @xmath19 .",
    "however , ozgur _ et al _ in @xcite are the first to exploit the linear - scaling result of mimo communication in a multiple - source network using a distributed mimo paradigm . for",
    "a _ dense _ network , they propose a hierarchical cooperative communication scheme with single - hop distributed mimo transmission to achieve a network throughput scaling of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and single - hop distributed mimo transmission .",
    "they further show that when the same scheme is applied to the more realistic extended network model , it results in a throughput @xmath22 , implying that for @xmath23 , the scheme outperforms simple multi - hopping .",
    "our work is motivated by @xcite .",
    "however , we propose a multi - hop distributed mimo scheme specifically designed for extended networks .",
    "furthermore , we show that with a small increase in the transmission power , our scheme performs uniformly better than simple multi - hopping for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "as far as we are aware , there is no existing work on analyzing the achievable rate of combining cooperative communication and multi - hop forwarding .",
    "finally , aeron and saligrama in @xcite have studied the effect of node cooperation on the capacity of wireless networks with a fixed receiver snr at all nodes and obtained @xmath24 network throughput , through spatially separated mimo relays which collaborate in their transmissions .",
    "however , the assumption of constant receiver snr at all nodes implies that the transmission power needs to scale as @xmath25 .",
    "in contrast , in this work we show that with much lower power scaling , the same communication rate can be achieved by using multi - hop distributed mimo transmissions .",
    "we consider an extended network with @xmath11 nodes distributed within the area @xmath26\\times[0,\\sqrt{n}]$ ] .",
    "we first evaluate the capacity results for nodes following a special topology that we call a _",
    "regular network_. in a regular network , we divide @xmath27 to @xmath11 squares of unit area and assume there is exactly one node in each such square .",
    "we then generalize our results to a _ random network _ , where nodes are distributed independently and uniformly over the area @xmath27 .",
    "a matching of the source - destination pairs is picked at random , so that each node is the destination of exactly one source .",
    "it is assumed that the sources are all sending their messages with a common source - to - destination rate @xmath28 bits / sec , and the total network throughput is @xmath29 bits / sec .",
    "each node divides its messages into sub - blocks of length @xmath30 bits and sends packets with length equal to a multiple of @xmath30 during the communication with its intended receiver .",
    "it will be clear later that the proper sub - block size @xmath30 depends only on the mimo transmission details and does not affect the throughput scaling analysis .",
    "in contrast , the multiplier to @xmath30 is an optimization parameter dependent on the optimal size of a cluster which will be explained in detail in section  [ cresult ] .",
    "similar to the model of @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , we consider a line - of - sight environment without fading or shadowing . the channel gain between two nodes @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the network is assumed to follow a standard baseband model and",
    "can be written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the euclidean distance between the two nodes , @xmath35 is the unit imaginary number , @xmath36 is the phase change distributed uniformly and independently in @xmath37 $ ] @xcite , and @xmath38 is the path loss exponent , such that the power of the received signal at node @xmath32 from node @xmath31 equals @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the transmission power of node @xmath31 .",
    "then , the received message at node @xmath32 at time @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath42=\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{t}[m]}h_{ij}[m]x_{i}[m]+z_j[m]+i_j[m ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ] represents the set of active senders at time @xmath41 transmitting signals @xmath44 $ ] to node @xmath32 , which can be added constructively @xcite , @xmath45 $ ] is the received message at node @xmath32 at time @xmath41 , @xmath46 $ ] is the additive white gaussian noise at node @xmath32 with variance @xmath47 , and @xmath48 $ ] is the interference from the nodes which are destructive to the reception of node @xmath32 .",
    "we do not consider sophisticated multi - user detection techniques at the receiver nodes and simply treat interference as noise to obtain a lower - bound on the network capacity .",
    "furthermore , since we are proposing a constructive lower - bound on the capacity , during each communication phase , a network topology which results in the lowest communication rate is considered .",
    "therefore , the dependency of the channel gains on time can be removed in our analysis .",
    "we consider a communication scheme whose rate provides a constructive lower - bound on the network capacity .",
    "we arrange the nodes into a hierarchical @xmath49 level clustering structure , each level consisting of 9 non - overlapping lower - level clusters in a 3-by-3 formation , such that the @xmath50__th - level cluster _",
    "_ refers to the set of nodes that lie in a square of area @xmath51 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ intra1](a ) .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we use the term _ cluster _ synonymously with the term _ @xmath49th - level cluster_.    the proposed scheme is comprised of three _ phases _ , intra - cluster message dissemination from the source to all nodes in its cluster , inter - cluster message forwarding toward the destination node s cluster , and message decoding at the destination . in the following we explain the transmission scheme in each phase for the regular network .",
    "the generalization to the case of a random network follows the same structure and the difference is explained in section  [ numsim ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use the notation @xmath52 , for the transmission power during the @xmath31th phase .",
    "* phase 1 : intra - cluster communication*. the goal of this phase is to distribute each source node s message to the set of @xmath53 nodes in the source s cluster ( which will serve as relays for the source in the next phase ) .",
    "we utilize a hierarchical cooperation strategy carried out in @xmath49 iterations as shown in fig .",
    "[ intra1](a ) .",
    "each source node divides its message to packets of length @xmath54 bits , ( i.e. , g(k ) sub - blocks and @xmath30 bits per sub - block ) .",
    "the packet s transmission is carried out in a @xmath49-level progression as shown in fig .",
    "[ intra1](b ) , such that after the @xmath50th iteration , the source @xmath55 will have forwarded @xmath56 bits of its packet .",
    "we assume that the nodes transmit with a common constant power @xmath57 during this phase .",
    "the details of this iterative communication scheme are given in the following .",
    "two @xmath50th - level clusters are said to be _ neighbors _ if their boundaries touch .",
    "therefore , each @xmath50th - level cluster has 8 neighbors . to avoid interference from neighboring clusters ,",
    "tdma is used to schedule transmission among the 9 partitioning @xmath58th - level clusters within a @xmath50th - level cluster .",
    "this is called a 9-tdma scheme . as shown in fig .",
    "[ sched](a ) , 9-tdma implies that , during the @xmath50th iteration , only one among the nine @xmath58th level clusters acts as the _ transmit - cluster _ , and its eight neighbor clusters are potential _ receive - clusters_. the @xmath58th level transmit- and receive - clusters communicate using distributed mimo transmission .",
    "we call each such communication a _ @xmath50th - level cast_. at the receive - cluster side , during the @xmath50th - level cast , each of the @xmath58th - level receive - clusters is set to active receive mode in a round - robbin manner , based on a specific order as depicted in fig .",
    "[ sched](a ) .    during the first iteration",
    ", an active source performs 8 consecutive @xmath59st - level casts to transmit a different sub - block of @xmath30 bits to each of its 8 neighbor nodes and keeps @xmath30 bits in its own buffer .",
    "hence , at the end of the first iteration , the 1st - level cluster contains @xmath60 bits . during the second iteration , as depicted in the 2nd - level in fig .",
    "[ intra1](a ) , the @xmath61 nodes inside the first level transmit - clusters act as distributed antennas , sending their messages at the same time . thus , during each @xmath62nd - level cast , @xmath60 bits are sent simultaneously using distributed mimo to one of the 8 neighbor receive - clusters of size @xmath63 .",
    "note that concurrently with this , the source can distribute another set of @xmath60 bits to its 1st - level cluster in preparation for the next 2nd - level cast .",
    "hence , through 8 consecutive 2nd - level casts , @xmath64 bits of the source are transmitted in this iteration to the 2nd - level cluster .",
    "this pattern repeats , so that in the @xmath49th iteration , @xmath54 bits of the source are transmitted to the @xmath49th - level cluster . the number of iterations , @xmath49 , and therefore the required time , @xmath65 , to finish this step are design parameters to be found in section  [ cresult ] .",
    "later , to determine the effect of interference on the network throughput , we note that the set of interferer clusters imposed by 9-tdma follows the pattern depicted in fig .",
    "[ intra1](a ) , where r represents the @xmath50th - level receive - cluster . the shaded transmit - clusters , with corresponding receive - clusters labeled ` r1 ' , act as interferers ( 1st _ tier _ interferers ) , since they are transmitting synchronously during r s reception .",
    "it is clear that in the @xmath31th tier there are @xmath66 interferers .",
    "( some of the 2nd tier interferers are depicted in the figure ) .",
    "as the clusters increase in size , we still have the same pattern for the interferers locations .",
    "this can be better seen in fig .",
    "[ intra1](a ) by considering the 2nd - level cast , where the spatial separation of interferers is multiplied by 3 from that of the 1st - level cast .    *",
    "phase 2 : inter - cluster communication*. the goal of this phase is to deliver the message vector of length @xmath54 bits from the source - clusters towards the destination - clusters in a multi - hop fashion . by a destination - cluster , we mean a cluster of size @xmath53 that includes the corresponding final destination for a specific source node .",
    "we consider a cluster - based routing scheme in which hop - by - hop communication between neighboring clusters is performed either horizontally or vertically as shown in fig .",
    "[ routingg ] .",
    "each intermediate cluster along the path is called a _ relay - cluster _ , which acts as a distributed multi - antenna system to forward its received message vector .    in the first hop , the nodes of the transmitting relay - cluster _ independently",

    ", we will show that within each hop @xmath69 symbols are transmitted in one shot and we benefit from @xmath53 spatial degrees of freedom in mimo communication .",
    "these symbols are sent synchronously to the receiving relay - cluster .",
    "the nodes in the receiving relay - cluster then amplify their receive observation to meet the power requirement @xmath70 , and forward it to the next cluster along the horizontal path .",
    "such message propagation continues until the message vector reaches the cluster with the same vertical boundaries as the destination cluster , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ routingg ] .",
    "then , the hop - by - hop distributed mimo communication among the clusters is performed vertically until the message vector reaches the destination cluster .",
    "we denote the required time to complete the routing of a node s message by @xmath71 .",
    "* phase 3 : message decoding at the destination*. in this phase , each node in the destination cluster has an observation of the message transmitted by the source @xmath55 .",
    "the nodes each quantize their observation into @xmath72 bits and synchronously transmit the quantized observations towards the destination using a common constant power @xmath73 .",
    "this communication setting can be considered as a simple distributed multiple - input single - output ( miso ) system in the destination cluster .",
    "we again use a 9-tdma scheduling in this phase to determine the active clusters for transmission , which results in interference mitigation .",
    "we denote the required time to complete message transmission from the destination cluster to the destination node by @xmath74 .",
    "in this section , we derive the asymptotic achievable network throughput @xmath75 using the proposed communication scheme .",
    "it is clear that the efficiency of this scheme hinges on the optimization of the cluster ( @xmath49th - level cluster ) size .",
    "while larger clusters result in higher mimo gain , better interferer separation , and lower cluster - hop count , the nodes inside large clusters need to distribute their messages to a large number of nodes and compete with many nodes for medium access . by considering such tradeoffs",
    ", we derive the optimal cluster size to minimize the total transmission time of the three communication phases .",
    "note that the communication overheads , such as node scheduling and hierarchy formation , are negligible in the long run and are ignored in our analysis @xcite@xcite@xcite .      during the @xmath76th iteration of intra - cluster message dissemination ,",
    "a @xmath50th - level cluster transmits a message vector to each of its 8 neighboring @xmath50th - level clusters in 8 consecutive @xmath76th - level casts .",
    "we now derive a lower - bound on the achievable rate , denoted @xmath77 , during each such transmission .",
    "consider two adjacent squares of side length @xmath78 which share an edge .",
    "the achievable communication rate between the corresponding two @xmath50th - level clusters can be expressed using mimo capacity results @xcite . using a notation similar to the one we adopted in ,",
    "the vector of the received messages at the @xmath50th - level receive - cluster can be expressed as @xmath79 where @xmath80 represents the @xmath81 channel matrix . treating the interference simply as another source of noise",
    ", the interference plus noise power at a node @xmath32 in the receive - cluster is given as @xmath82 , where @xmath83 represents the interference power at @xmath32 during the @xmath76th - level cast . in order to derive a capacity",
    "lower - bound , we can replace the interference power at all of the nodes inside a _ specific _ @xmath50th - level cluster by @xmath84 .",
    "assuming that the transmitted signals , @xmath85 , are iid and chosen from an gaussian distribution @xmath86 and perfect channel state information is available at the receive cluster , the mutual information between the transmit- and receive - clusters is lower - bounded by the special case of gaussian noise plus interference .",
    "hence , we have @xmath87    we now derive a more useful expression to replace the above general form .",
    "an example of intra - cluster mimo communication is depicted in fig .",
    "[ sched](a ) for 1st - level clusters of size @xmath61 .",
    "the worst case topology happens when the transmitters are located at the furthest possible distance from the receivers .",
    "figure  [ sched](b ) demonstrates such a topology in the 3rd - level cast for two horizontally adjacent 2nd - level clusters of size @xmath88 . without loss of generality , we label the border ( e.g. , center red line in figure  [ sched](b ) ) between the two adjacent @xmath50th - level clusters as the reference @xmath89-coordinate . then , given the constraint that there is one node inside each square , setting the transmit nodes @xmath89-coordinates to @xmath90 , and the receive nodes @xmath89-coordinates to @xmath91 results in maximum separation between them .",
    "we next find the @xmath92-coordinates for the worst case topology .",
    "we focus on the transmit and receive nodes which lie in squares adjacent to the border .",
    "the @xmath92-coordinate for other nodes follows the same structure by symmetry .",
    "we index the @xmath92-coordinates of the horizontal edges from 1 to @xmath93 as shown in fig .",
    "[ sched](b ) . in general",
    "it is not easy to find the indices along the transmit and receive edges that minimize @xmath77 .",

    "lemma [ lemma2 ] then provides the explicit @xmath92-coordinates .",
    "the proofs are given in the appendix .",
