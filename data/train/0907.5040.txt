    "over the last decade , there have been a growing number of high - angular - resolution studies using observations from submm / mm and cm interferometers , aimed at understanding morphological and kinematical features associated with the massive star formation process , such as molecular outflows , possible rotating disks or envelopes , and inward accretion flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more recently , studies based on observations from the submillimeter array ( sma ) , a combined power of high - angular - resolution and broad frequency coverage , have begun to shed light on the physical and chemical diversities in high - mass star - forming cores at different evolutionary stages ( e.g. , rathborne et al . 2008 ; beuther et al . 2009 ; zhang et al .",
    "these efforts provided a wealth of information that greatly advanced our knowledge of massive star formation .    in this paper",
    "we present a high - angular - resolution study of the high - mass star - forming region hh 8081 , which has a bolometric luminosity of @xmath1 @xmath2 at an adopted distance of 1.7 kpc @xcite .",
    "this region is distinguished by a 5.3 pc radio jet that has an opening angle of @xmath31@xmath4 , known as the best collimated radio jet driven from a high - mass protostar @xcite .",
    "recent _ spitzer _",
    "8 @xmath5 m imaging reveals a bi - conical outflow cavity surrounding the radio jet @xcite .",
    "the jet powering source has been detected from mid - infrared to cm wavelengths @xcite , yet some basic properties of the source , such as physical and chemical conditions of the circumstellar matter , remain unclear . here",
    "we present a detailed study of the dust continuum and molecular line emission of the radio jet powering source , and the discovery of an exceptional co outflow containing fast moving molecular bullets .",
    "the sma observations toward the phase center ( r.a .",
    ", decl.)@xmath6 were undertaken with eight antennas on 2008 june 30 in the compact configuration and on 2008 september 9 in the sub - compact configuration , both under good weather conditions . particularly the sub - compact data were taken with @xmath7@xmath30.020.03 . the 4 ghz correlator was configured to cover rest frequencies of 219.2 to 221.2 ghz in the lower sideband and 229.2 to 231.2 ghz in the upper sideband . in the compact configuration , we observed uranus , 3c454.3 , and 3c273 for bandpass calibration , callisto for flux calibration , and j1911 - 201 to monitor the time dependent gain . in the sub - compact configuration , observations of 3c454.3 , uranus , and j1733 - 130 and j1911 - 201",
    "were used for the bandpass , flux , and gain calibrations , respectively .",
    "the data were calibrated using the idl mir package and then exported to miriad for further processing .",
    "self - calibration was performed on continuum and the solutions were applied to lines as well .",
    "the two data sets were jointly imaged with the robust parameter set to 0.5 , resulting in a synthesized beam of @xmath3@xmath8@xmath9@xmath10 at fwhm .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the 1.3 mm continuum map and the integrated intensity maps of lines detected from a variety of molecular species .",
    "the mm continuum reveals two dominant peaks mm1 and mm2 ; mm1 coincides well with the radio source that powers the hh 8081 radio jet and mm2 is spatially associated with h@xmath11o masers and a very weak radio source @xcite . in addition ,",
    "emission lines from high - density tracers , such as ch@xmath12oh , ch@xmath12cn , h@xmath13co , ocs , and hnco , clearly reveals another dense core mc ( figures [ fig1]b[fig1]f ) , although the mm continuum map only shows a weak enhancement toward this core . in figure [ fig1]b the ch@xmath12oh ( 8@xmath14@xmath15 emission toward mc is eminently bright with a peak flux of 6.4 jybeam@xmath0",
    "this narrow spectral component at a lsr velocity of @xmath16 kms@xmath0 appears to be a maser emission .",
    "@xcite detected a 44 ghz methanol maser in the vicinity of mc , which is consistent with our 229.8 ghz detection as both masers are class i transitions @xcite .",
    "apart from the maser emission , most thermal line emission in figure [ fig1 ] appears brighter toward mm1 . in particular lines of ch@xmath12oh ( 15@xmath17@xmath18 and hnco @xmath19@xmath20 and those from so@xmath11 isotopologues",
    "are only seen in mm1 .",
    "we will discuss these diversities in section [ divers ] .",
    "mm1 has an integrated flux of 1.2 jy at 1.3 mm continuum , in agreement with the bima measurement of 0.97 jy at 1.4 mm and is completely dominated by the dust emission @xcite . the mm continuum emission from mc",
    "does not appear to be very centrally peaked and is blended with the mm2 emission .",
    "therefore we can not obtain a reliable estimate of the continuum flux for mc alone .",
    "the measured flux toward mm2 and mc amounts to 0.8 jy and is apparently dominated by mm2 . from the continuum fluxes and assuming thermal equilibrium between the gas and dust hence adopting the temperatures derived from the ch@xmath12cn emission ( section [ divers ] ) , we obtain a gas mass of 634 @xmath21 for mm1 and a total mass of 1265 @xmath21 for mm2 and mc , for a dust opacity @xmath22@xmath31.90.35 @xmath23 g@xmath0 or an emissivity index @xmath24@xmath312 @xcite .",
    "figure [ co ] shows the high velocity co ( 21 ) emission integrated over every 20.4 kms@xmath0 from @xmath25 to @xmath26 kms@xmath0 in the blueshifted lobe and from 28.2 to 109.2 kms@xmath0 in the redshifted lobe .",
    "the emission at lower velocities ( @xmath27@xmath2815 kms@xmath0 with respect to the systemic velocity of 12 kms@xmath0 for mm2 ) suffers from side lobes and missing flux due to inadequate @xmath29 coverage , hampering the interpretation of the morphology and kinematics , hence we focus on the high velocity co emission in this work .",
    "the most remarkable feature in figure [ co ] is a jet - like outflow emanating from mm2 to the southeast ( se ) , which exhibits extremely high velocity ( ehv ) emission up to @xmath25 kms@xmath0 for the blueshifted lobe and @xmath30 kms@xmath0 for the redshifted lobe above a 3@xmath31 level of @xmath360 mjybeam@xmath0 per 1.2 kms@xmath0 .",
    "this outflow shows a knotty appearance with multiple clumps aligned along the flow axis . in addition , two more collimated flows , the northwest and northeast flows , are seen in figure [ co]e ; the former apparently originates from mc , whereas it is difficult with the existing data to unambiguously assign a driving source to the latter .",
    "these two flows both extend well beyond the sma primary beam of @xmath354@xmath32 at 230 ghz , thus are not further discussed in this work .",
    "figure [ so ] shows the so ( @xmath33@xmath34 ) emission integrated over five velocity intervals .",
    "the blueshifted emission arising from the se outflow is detected as an ehv clump in figure [ so]a and a low to high velocity clump in figure [ so]b . in figure",
    "[ so]c the blueshifted low velocity emission mostly traces a wide - angle outflow surrounding the radio jet axis . in figure",
    "[ so]d the redshifted low velocity emission reveals two compact clumps coincident with mm1 and mc , as well as extended structures probably attributed to outflows from mm1 and/or mc . in figure",
    "[ so]e , a redshifted clump is detected at very high velocities ; this structure can also be identified in co in figures [ co]e and [ co]f , and is apparently associated with mc .",
    "the ch@xmath12cn ( 12@xmath3511@xmath35 ) emission is a good thermometer of dense gas surrounding high - mass protostars . assuming that all the @xmath36 components are in local thermodynamical equilibrium and tracing the same gas",
    ", we perform a simultaneous fitting , taking into account the optical depth effect , to all the detected components by means of grid search @xmath37 minimization . from figure [ ch3cn ]",
    ", the best fitting models agree well with the observations , and yield gas temperatures of 110@xmath38 k for mm1 , 35@xmath39 k for mm2 , and 45@xmath40 k for mc .",
    "in addition to the ch@xmath12oh ( 8@xmath147@xmath41)@xmath42 line shown in figure [ fig1]b , thermal emission in ch@xmath12oh ( 8@xmath437@xmath44)@xmath42 and ( 3@xmath454@xmath46)@xmath42 is detected in all the three cores but appears much brighter in mm1 .",
    "the ch@xmath12oh ( 15@xmath1716@xmath47)@xmath42 emission , however , is seen in mm1 alone ( figure [ fig1]g ) .",
    "this is not surprising since this transition has an upper energy level ( @xmath48 ) of 374 k , dramatically higher than 3996 k for the other three transitions .",
    "as indicated by the higher temperature inferred from the ch@xmath12cn emission , only the mm1 core possesses sufficient hot gas to populate the high - excitation ch@xmath12oh .",
    "hnco shows a diversity similar to ch@xmath12oh ; the hnco ( 10@xmath499@xmath50 ) emission is seen in both mm1 and mc , and probably mm2 as well , but the hnco ( 10@xmath519@xmath52 ) emission is detected in mm1 alone .",
    "lines of hnco ( @xmath53 ) are suggested as a good probe of the far - infrared field since its @xmath54@xmath550 ladders are populated primarily by far - infrared radiation rather than collisions with h@xmath11 @xcite . the warm / hot dust in mm1",
    "is expected to produce far - infrared photons responsible for the population of the @xmath54=1 hnco , giving rise to the hnco ( 10@xmath519@xmath52 ) emission , however , the cooler dust in mm2 and mc would not provide sufficient far - infrared radiation to populate appreciable hnco at @xmath54@xmath550 .",
    "the emission from so@xmath11 and its isotopologues exhibits a significant diversity among the three cores . besides the so@xmath11 ( 11@xmath5612@xmath57 )",
    "emission shown in figure [ fig1]i , the lines of so@xmath11 ( 22@xmath5823@xmath59 ) , @xmath60so@xmath11 ( 11@xmath6110@xmath49 ) , @xmath60so@xmath11 ( 4@xmath623@xmath63 ) , @xmath60so@xmath11 ( 22@xmath6422@xmath65 ) , and @xmath66so@xmath11 ( 11@xmath6110@xmath49 ) , are clearly detected in mm1 . however",
    ", none of them is seen in mc or mm2 .",
    "the detected transitions have @xmath48 ranging from 19 to 353 k , hence the temperature variation among the cores can not solely account for the non - detection of any transition in mc or mm2 . in addition",
    ", the so@xmath11 chemistry does not seem to be much dependent on luminosity or mass of the central forming star , as bright so@xmath11 emission was detected in low - mass star - forming regions as well ( e.g. , iras 16293 - 2422 , * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore the chemical effect that plays a central role in shaping the appearance of so@xmath11 in these cores . if so@xmath11 forms via the reaction of so@xmath67oh@xmath68so@xmath11 , as adopted by @xcite and @xcite , the non - detection of so@xmath11 points to the deficiency of oh in mc and mm2 , since bright so emission is detected toward all the three cores",
    "this is plausible considering that the uv induced photodissociation of h@xmath11o may be the primary source of oh in mm1 @xcite and the formation of other molecules detected in mc and mm2 does not necessarily involve the oh radical .",
    "the rich emission lines from so@xmath11 and its isotopologues seem to probe a more evolved stage of mm1 , in agreement with recent sulphur chemistry models @xcite .    with a gas temperature of 110 k and moderately rich molecular line emission , mm1 seems to be at an early hot core phase @xcite .",
    "of the two younger cores mm2 and mc , the latter is likely more evolved with its more active molecular line emission .",
    "one issue to be addressed toward mc is that the core appears relatively faint in the dust continuum , which may be caused by the deficiency of dust or by a flattened density profile hence a large fraction of the emission being filtered out by the interferometer . with the existing data we can not shed more light on this issue .",
    "however , its hot - core - like line emission is very likely excited by a high - mass protostar .",
    "although nearby low - mass protostars my excite emission in complex organic molecules such as ch@xmath12oh and ch@xmath12cn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the emission may not be detectable at much larger distances .",
    "quantitatively , if the dust and gas reach thermal equilibrium , the luminosity of the central source can be estimated based on the heating of the dust @xcite . for dust temperatures of 35110 k at scales of @xmath69 and a typical dust emissivity index of 1.5 , the luminosity of the central star ranges from 2@xmath70@xmath71 to 4@xmath70@xmath72 @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the central protostars in the three cores are likely to be massive .",
    "to obtain a more reasonable assessment of the mass and energetics of the se outflow , we calculate the gas mass down to @xmath27@xmath36 kms@xmath0 ; but to alleviate contamination from ambient gas and unrelated features we only take into account an area closely encompassing the jet - like structure . following the procedure of @xcite , we derive the outflow mass , momentum , dynamical timescale , mass rate , and momentum rate of 0.22 @xmath21 , 4.9 @xmath21 kms@xmath0 , 2.2@xmath70@xmath71 yr , @xmath73 @xmath21yr@xmath0 , and 2.2@xmath74 @xmath21kms@xmath0yr@xmath0 , respectively . considering the missing flux and optical depth effect at low velocities ,",
    "the derived mass and energetics may represent lower limits .",
    "the overlapping blue- and redshifted emission along the jet - like structure suggests that the flow axis is strongly inclined to the plane of sky . in projection the flow axis appears to wiggle over a small angle of @xmath2820@xmath4 .",
    "if the flow axis wiggles along the line of sight as it does in the plane of sky , the inclination angle is likely about 10@xmath4 , half of the wiggle angle .",
    "the outflow mass and momentum rates corrected for the inclination angle would amount to 6@xmath70@xmath73 @xmath21yr@xmath0 and 7@xmath75 @xmath21kms@xmath0yr@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the one - sided appearance of the outflow is probably ascribed to the peculiar environment . in projection",
    "the central source mm2 is close ( @xmath3@xmath76 ) to the hh 8081 radio jet , which is surrounded by a biconical cavity .",
    "the northwestern side of mm2 is likely deficient in dense gas and the outflow is expanding into the radio jet cavity , thus can not create appreciable co emission .",
    "figures [ pmv]a and [ pmv]b show , respectively , the mass - velocity ( mv ) and position  velocity ( pv , cut along the major axis ) diagrams of the se outflow .",
    "the most interesting characteristics in the two diagrams are the distinct ehv features that appear as abrupt bumps in the mv diagram ( denoted by arrows ) and as enhanced condensations in the pv diagram ( denoted by dashed circles ) . this kind of compact and fast moving features are recognized as `` molecular bullets '' in low - mass class 0 protostellar outflows @xcite .",
    "the bullets in the se outflow are , to our knowledge , the first discovery of molecular bullets originating from a high - mass star - forming core .",
    "the bright b1 and b2 bullets have sizes of @xmath30.040.05 pc and masses of 10@xmath77 @xmath21 .",
    "however , recent multi - transition sio and co observations yield hot gas ( @xmath55100 k ) in low - mass molecular bullets @xcite ; if this is the case for the b1 and b2 bullets , their masses would reach @xmath7810@xmath79 @xmath21 .",
    "it is also worth noting that the b1 bullet is clearly detected in so ( @xmath33@xmath34 ) , suggesting shock activity in this bullet ( figure [ so]a ) .    from its velocity profile shown in figure [ pmv]c , the b2 bullet has the bulk material moving at highest velocities , with a gradual decrease toward the systemic velocity .",
    "the b1 bullet exhibits a similar but less prominent profile .",
    "the velocity structure of the two bullets is in direct contrast to what is expected if the bullets were created in situ from entrained or swept - up ambient medium , in which case the profile would have a steep decrease toward the systemic velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is more likely that the majority of the bullet material is ejected from the close vicinity of the central protostar . in this scenario",
    "the presence of multiple molecular bullets directly manifests an episodic nature of the outflow .",
    "@xcite resolved h@xmath11o maser spots toward mm2 into two groups , with one group aligned in a linear distribution and the other located to the ne .",
    "although the h@xmath11o maser spots are seen very close to mm2 ( @xmath3500 au in projection ) , we find that in both velocity and orientation the ne and linear maser groups agree well with the b1 and b2 bullets , respectively .",
    "this further supports the scenario that the bullets are ejected from the close vicinity of the central protostar .",
    "a sketchy and tempting interpretation is that the episodic ejections from the central protostar or star - disk system collides with the existing flow , re - accelerating the flow material to form the fast moving bullets ; the maser emission , which is pumped under critical conditions , signifies the collision sites . future proper motion measurements of the h@xmath11o maser spots and multi - transition observations of the bullets may place more stringent constraints on the excitation mechanisms of the two extreme phenomena .",
    "high velocity , jet - like molecular outflows are often seen in low - mass class 0 protostars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in theoretical models they are physically linked to the earliest - phase disk accretion within a dense envelope @xcite .",
    "however , jet - like outflows with high velocity emission are still rarely identified toward high - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on single - dish co observations , @xcite report high velocity bullets and jets toward the well - known orion - kl outflow , but recent interferometric observations show a fan - shaped or explosive morphology of the outflow @xcite .",
    "the se outflow has a well - defined jet - like morphology , reaching an order of 100 kms@xmath0 in both blue- and redshifted lobes , thus apparently favors a disk - mediated accretion onto the central protostar .",
    "the ehv emission may trace part of the outer layer of an underlying wind .",
    "moreover , the outflow contains multiple molecular bullets , indicating an episodic mass - loss process and further pointing to an episodic nature of the central accretion process .",
    "we report the discovery of jet - like co outflows in the hh 8081 star - forming region . in particular , the outflow arising from core mm2 exhibits blue- and redshifted line wings close to 100 kms@xmath0 from the cloud velocity , and molecular bullets , which points to an episodic , disk - mediated accretion for massive star formation .",
    "three dense cores identified in continuum and molecular line emission demonstrate physical and chemical diversities which suggest an evolutionary sequence that mm2 is younger than mc , which is in turn younger than the hot molecular core mm1 .",
