    "experimentally , the accmor collaboration in 1981 observed a @xmath5 , @xmath6 structure at 1850 mev in the @xmath7 @xmath8-wave with a width of about 240 mev@xcite .",
    "subsequently , the ves collaboration reported a @xmath6 threshold enhancement in the @xmath9 channel with a mass of about 1840 mev and width of about 210 mev in their @xmath10 data@xcite and also in @xmath11 data where @xmath12 ; they also observed a strong peak at the same mass in the @xmath7 @xmath8-wave in their @xmath13 data@xcite . in 2001 , anisovich et al .",
    "reported a @xmath5 , @xmath6 resonance with a mass of about 1880 mev and a width of about 255 mev in the @xmath9 and @xmath7 @xmath8-wave@xcite .",
    "more recently , a similar @xmath3 resonance was observed by the e852 collaboration in the @xmath14@xcite , @xmath15@xcite , and @xmath9@xcite channels , respectively .",
    "it has been established that these observations in different channels refer to a single state @xmath0@xcite . in the meson summary table of the pdg2008 , the mass and width of the @xmath0",
    "are quoted to be @xmath16 mev and @xmath17 mev , respectively@xcite .    as for the @xmath0 nature , after a @xmath3 hybrid conjecture [ @xmath18 was first proposed by anisovich et al.@xcite , several groups also claimed the @xmath0 being a viable non - exotic hybrid candidate@xcite . with the @xmath19 as the well - established @xmath20 @xmath4 state@xcite , the @xmath0 looks like the @xmath21 rather than the @xmath1 isovector @xmath4 state [ @xmath22 $ ] based on its mass , because the observed mass of the @xmath0 just overlaps the flux - tube model prediction of about @xmath23 gev for the light @xmath3",
    "hybrid@xcite , but is about 200 mev lower than the godfrey - isgur ( gi ) quark model prediction of about 2.1 gev for the @xmath1 nonstrange @xmath4 state@xcite .",
    "however , comparing the experimental evidence for the @xmath0 with the strong decay properties of the @xmath21 expected by the model of hybrid meson decay developed by page , swanson , and szczepaniak(pss ) based on the heavy quark expansion of qcd and the strong coupling flux tube picture of nonperturbative glue@xcite(see the table ii of ref.@xcite ) , one can find the following features of the @xmath0 casting doubt over the hybrid interpretation for the @xmath0 :    \\i ) the observation in the @xmath15 channel of the @xmath0 is inconsistent with the hybrid interpretation where the coupling of the @xmath21 to @xmath15 is expected to vanish .",
    "\\ii ) the observation in the @xmath7 @xmath8-wave of the @xmath24 is also inconsistent with the hybrid interpretation where the @xmath7 @xmath8-wave is strongly suppressed and the @xmath25-wave is dominant .",
    "\\iii ) the measured width of the @xmath0 , @xmath17 mev , is again inconsistent with the hybrid interpretation where the @xmath21 width is less than 100 mev .",
    "therefore , the claims for the @xmath0 can be accepted as a resonance state of exotic nature may be premature .",
    "in fact , it is important to exhaust possible conventional @xmath4 description of the @xmath0 before resorting to more exotic interpretation such as a hybrid . in this work",
    ", we shall discuss the possibility of the @xmath0 being the @xmath26 . as mentioned above",
    ", a problem with identifying the @xmath0 with the @xmath26 is that its mass is about 200 mev lower than the expectation from the gi quark model .",
    "notice that the @xmath27 and @xmath28 , both about 100 - 200 mev lower in mass than the gi quark model anticipated@xcite , turn out the excellent candidates for radial excitations@xcite , which indicates that gi quark model maybe overestimate the masses of the higher-@xmath29 radially excited mesons by about 100 - 200 mev , and therefore the @xmath26 with a mass about 1.9 gev is not implausible .",
    "also , the mass of the @xmath26 in the spectrum integral equation@xcite is expected to be about 1.937 gev , very close to the @xmath0 mass .",
    "therefore , the assignment of the @xmath0 as the @xmath26 seems also possible based on its mass .",
    "however , only the @xmath0 mass information is insufficient to identify its nature , further studies of its decay dynamics are needed . the main purpose of this work is to discuss whether the @xmath26 interpretation for the @xmath0 is reasonable or not by investigating its strong decay properties in two models , the @xmath2 model and the flux - tube model .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the decay properties of the @xmath0 as the @xmath26 within the @xmath2 model and the flux - tube model are presented .",
    "the discussions are presented in sec .",
    "iii , and the summary and conclusion are given in secs .",
    "the @xmath2 model and the flux - tube model which are the standard models for strong decays at least for mesons in the initial state , have been widely used to evaluate the strong decays of hadrons@xcite , since they give a good description of many of the observed decay amplitudes and partial widths of the hadrons . in this work",
    ", we shall employ the @xmath2 model and the flux - tube model with simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) wave functions to evaluate the two - body open - flavor strong decay widths of the initial state .",
    "since there exists exhaustive literature on these two models , we just list the numerical values of the partial decay widths of the @xmath0 as the @xmath26 in table 1 . in our calculation , the sho wave function scale parameter @xmath30 , the pair production strength parameter @xmath31 in the @xmath2 model , the pair - creation constant @xmath32 and the string tension @xmath33 in the flux - tube model , and the constituent quark mass @xmath34 are is higher than that used by ref.@xcite ( 0.505 ) by a factor of @xmath35 due to different field conventions , constant factor in @xmath36 , etc .",

    "the initial state mass is set to @xmath57 mev . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is clear from table 1 that the numerical results in the @xmath2 model are similar to those in the flux - tube model .",
    "very characteristic differences between the @xmath26 and @xmath21 assignments for the @xmath0 are evident when we compare our results with the expectations from the pss model for the @xmath21@xcite .",
    "the total width of the @xmath26 is expected to be about 223 mev in the @xmath2 model or about 233 mev in the flux - tube model , both in good agreement with the @xmath0 width ; however , the total width of the @xmath21 is expected to be less than 100 mev , at least 100 mev lower than the experiment . the partial width of the @xmath58 is significantly large , consistent with the observation in the @xmath15 channel of the @xmath0 ; whereas the @xmath59 is expected to vanish .",
    "the @xmath60 is dominant in the @xmath8-wave and the @xmath8-wave width is significantly large , and therefore the @xmath26 should be readily observable in the @xmath7 @xmath8-wave , consistent with the observation of the @xmath0 in the @xmath7 @xmath8-wave ; while the @xmath61 is strongly suppressed in the @xmath8-wave and dominant in the @xmath25-wave .",
    "also , for the @xmath26 , the partial width of the @xmath62 mode , the @xmath63-wave widths of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 modes , and the @xmath66-wave width of the @xmath7 mode are not zero , especially the @xmath67 @xmath63-wave width is significantly large ; whereas for the @xmath21 , all these widths vanish exactly .",
    "the further experimental study on these decay modes are also important to examine whether the @xmath0 is the @xmath26 or the @xmath21 .    from these remarkable discriminants between the @xmath26 and the @xmath21 ,",
    "it is clear that the available experimental evidence for the @xmath0 is consistent with it being the @xmath26 rather than the @xmath21 for the @xmath26 is about 4 , inconsistent with the measured value of @xmath68@xcite which agrees with the pss model prediction of about 23 for the @xmath69@xcite .",
    "notice that the systematic error is not estimated in this measured datum , and this datum is not used for averages , fits , limits , etc . by pdg2008@xcite .",

    "the dependence of the predicted results on the initial state mass @xmath70 and the sho function scale parameter @xmath30 is studied .",
    "we show the variation of the total width of the @xmath26 with @xmath70 and @xmath30 in fig .",
    "1 . in both the @xmath2 model and the flux - tube model ,",
    "the total width of the @xmath26 becomes large with the increase of the @xmath70 , and it always lies in the width range of the @xmath0 . when the @xmath30 varies from 300 to 500 mev , in the flux - tube model the @xmath26 width varies from about 230 to 260 mev , depending weakly on the @xmath30 , while in the @xmath2 model it varies dramatically with the @xmath30 . in order to reproduce the @xmath0 width in the @xmath2 model",
    ", it requires @xmath71 mev , overlapping the typical value of about @xmath72 mev used in the computation of the light meson decays for the sho wave functions with a common @xmath30@xcite .",
    "the partial widths of the @xmath26 versus the @xmath70 are shown in fig .",
    "2 , where the variations of the partial widths of the @xmath26 with the @xmath70 in the @xmath2 model are similar to those in the flux - tube model . the partial widths increase when the @xmath70 increases and the dominant decay modes are @xmath67 , @xmath15 , @xmath7 , @xmath73 , @xmath65 and @xmath9 .",
    "the partial widths of the @xmath26 versus the @xmath30 are shown in fig .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "3 that in two models , @xmath67 , @xmath15 , @xmath7 , @xmath73 , @xmath65 and @xmath9 are still the dominant decay modes when the @xmath30 varies . for small @xmath30 ( @xmath74 mev )",
    ", @xmath73 dominates @xmath9 , however for large @xmath30 ( @xmath75 mev ) , @xmath9 dominates @xmath73 . in the vicinity of @xmath76 mev , @xmath77 .",
    "the similar behavior also exists for the modes @xmath14 and @xmath78 .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath79 and @xmath80 for the @xmath0 would be useful for the reasonable choice for the @xmath30 .",
    "we note that for the @xmath26 , the @xmath7 @xmath8-wave dominates the @xmath25-wave and the @xmath67 @xmath63-wave dominates the @xmath81-wave , which is unusual because in most cases the lower partial waves are dominant . as mentioned above , these results are remarkably different with the expectations from the pss model@xcite for the @xmath21 .",
    "we find that in both the @xmath2 model and the flux - tube model , the @xmath63-wave always dominates the @xmath81-wave for the @xmath82 and the @xmath8-wave always dominates the @xmath25-wave for the @xmath60 when the @xmath70 varies in the mass range of the @xmath0 and @xmath30 varies in the range 370 - 420 mev , the required range for reproducing the @xmath0 width in the @xmath2 model mentioned above . determining these partial widths ratios experimentally is very important to distinguish the @xmath26 interpretation from the @xmath21 assignment for the @xmath0 .",
    "generally speaking , the pure @xmath26 can mix with the pure @xmath21 to produce the physical state @xmath0 .",
    "the available experimental evidence for the @xmath0 is in favor of the @xmath26 interpretation for the @xmath0 based on the remarkably different decay patterns of the @xmath26 and @xmath21 , but it is insufficient to quantitatively determine the @xmath4-hybrid content of the @xmath0 being the mixture of the @xmath26 and @xmath21 , the measured partial widths of the @xmath0 are needed to determine the hybrid - quarkonium content of the @xmath0 quantitatively . ] , which is essential to confirm or refute that the possibility of the hybrid admixture in the @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the possibility of the @xmath0 being in fact a mixture of the @xmath26 and @xmath21 might exist at present time .",
    "we can qualitatively estimate the hybrid component of the @xmath0 would be small based on its available experimental information .",
    "the @xmath83 is expected to vanish from the pss model@xcite , therefore , the observation of the @xmath0 in the @xmath15 channel@xcite makes that the substantial hybrid admixture in the @xmath0 seems impossible .",
    "however , it should be noted that the @xmath0 signal in the @xmath15 channel was observed only by the e852 collaboration@xcite , and even it is not clear whether the unitarity conserving fit to the @xmath15 mass distributions would need to have the @xmath0 decaying to @xmath15 or not .",
    "therefore , further evidence is needed to confirm whether the hybrid component of the @xmath0 is small or not . fortunately , as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , the @xmath0 has been observed by three different groups in the @xmath7 @xmath8-wave , which implies that the @xmath21 component of the @xmath0 would be small because the @xmath61 is strongly suppressed in the @xmath8-wave .",
    "similarly , the further experimental information of the @xmath0 in the @xmath78 and @xmath84_{l=3}$ ] channels would be useful to shed light on this issue .    finally , our predicted @xmath85 for the @xmath26 inconsistent with the measurement of the e852 collaboration@xcite may be a hint for the @xmath0 being in fact a mixture of the @xmath26 and @xmath21 , and the small hybrid admixture in the @xmath0 might make this measured ratio shift from the predicted value for the pure @xmath26 .",
    "the strong decays of the @xmath0 as the @xmath26 are investigated in both the @xmath2 model and the flux - tube model .",
    "the overall behaviors of the decay modes in the @xmath2 model are similar to those in the flux - tube model .",
    "the decay properties of the @xmath26 and the @xmath21 are remarkably different .",
    "the decay modes @xmath67 , @xmath15 , @xmath7 , @xmath86 , @xmath62 and @xmath65 are crucial for distinguishing the conventional quarkonium interpretation from the hybrid assignment of the @xmath0 .",
    "the available experimental evidence for the @xmath0 is consistent with it being the conventional @xmath1 @xmath4 meson rather than the light @xmath3 hybrid .",
    "the possibility of the small hybrid admixture in the @xmath0 might exist .",
    "further experimental study on the partial widths of the @xmath0 is desirable .",
    "we tend to conclude that the @xmath0 is the convincing @xmath1 @xmath4 state or the @xmath1 @xmath4 with small hybrid admixture .",
