    "in general , close binaries , and especially the eclipsing ones , are stellar objects whose absolute parameters and evolutionary status can be easily derived from observations .",
    "single @xmath0  scuti stars show discrepancy from binary - members regarding their evolutionary status .",
    "the single ones are situated on the main sequence ( hereafter ms ) or moving from it to the giant branch . on the other hand , the @xmath0  scuti components in binaries",
    "show slow evolution through the ms , thus they are very useful tools to diagnose this extraordinary part of a stellar lifetime .",
    "this difference in evolution is connected with the mass transfer process and tidal distortions occurring in binary systems during their ms life @xcite .",
    "therefore , single and binary - contained @xmath0  scuti stars , although they present similar pulsational properties , should not be considered of the same type due to a likely different evolutionary past .",
    "especially the ones in classical algols show variable pulsational characteristics due to mass gain @xcite , a process that is responsible for differences in the excitation mechanism , i.e. @xmath2-driven oscillations compared to tidally induced or mass - accretion induced oscillations .",
    "additionally , calculation of the absolute parameters and the identification of the oscillating characteristics of a binary s pulsational component provide the means to obtain a detailed picture of the star .",
    "obviously , the larger the sample of such stars the more information and conclusions can be derived .    during the last decade interest for pulsating stars in close binaries",
    "has increased significantly and a lot of discoveries announced .",
    "@xcite introduced the oea ( oscillating ea ) stars as the ( b)a - f spectral type mass - accreting ms pulsators in semi - detached algol - type eclipsing binary ( hereafter ebs ) systems .",
    "@xcite made a first attempt to find a connection between pulsation and orbital periods of systems with @xmath0  scuti component and resulted into a linear relation .",
    "@xcite published a catalogue containing 89 systems and distinguished them according to their pulsational properties .",
    "@xcite also published a similar list including 43 cases of systems including a @xmath0  sct component .",
    "space missions such as _ corot _ and _ kepler _ have been discovering many pulsating stars in binaries ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "their measurements provide the means to derive many pulsation frequencies and identify the oscillating modes with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the present work is a continuation of the survey for @xmath0  scuti components in ebs of @xcite .",
    "eight new such systems are presented herein for the first time , while the results of some cases that were recently discovered by other investigators are confirmed .",
    "the majority of the observed systems were selected from the lists of @xcite .",
    "the results of both surveys , which enriched significantly ( @xmath3 ) the sample of such binaries , can therefore be used for future space and/or ground based observing campaigns .",
    "the study of the ` _ _ o__bserved@xmath1__c__alculated ' times of minima variation(s ) ( hereafter o@xmath1c analysis ) of an eb provides valuable information for the mechanisms which form its orbital period ( e.g. mass transfer , third body , magnetic influences etc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ` snapshot ' of the binary , i.e. its light curve ( hereafter lc ) , leads us to understand directly which physical processes are occurring ( e.g. third light existence , roche lobe filling ) .",
    "the combined information from these two independent methods of analysis provides a more comprehensive view of a binary system .",
    "eleven systems exhibiting oscillating behaviour were selected for further observations and eight of them are studied using efficient modern techniques for lc and photometric frequency analyses .",
    "the remaining three cases qy  aql , bo  her , and io  uma , will be presented in a future work .",
    "four of these eleven were found to have orbital period changes from o@xmath1c analysis .",
    "the photometric observations were carried out during september 2008 - september 2011 at the gerostathopoulion observatory of the university of athens ( uoa ) located in athens , hellas , and at the kryonerion ( kry ) astronomical station of the astronomical institute of the national observatory of athens located at mt .",

    "the instrumentation used for the observations is described in detail in table  1 .",
    "aperture photometry was applied to the data and differential magnitudes for all systems were obtained using the software _ muniwin _",
    "v.1.1.26 @xcite .",
    "the adopted observational strategy in this survey was the same as that described in detail in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "briefly , the observational guidelines were : i ) the time span should be greater than 3  hr , ii ) the filter @xmath4 or @xmath5 should be used , iii ) the comparison star should be of similar magnitude and spectral type to the variable , iv ) appropriate exposure times and binning modes must be used for the best possible photometric @xmath6 ( signal - to - noise ratio ) .",

    "the observations were obtained outside the primary eclipse , since the primary component ( hotter one ) was the candidate @xmath0  sct star .",
    "the eight systems found to exhibit pulsational behaviour and whose complete lcs were obtained are listed in table  3 along with the corresponding comparison and check stars .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were obtained with the 1.3  m ritchey - chrtien telescope at skinakas observatory , mt .",

    "we used 900-s and 2000-s exposure times for wy  cet and uw  cyg , respectively .",
    "both spectra were observed well inside the secondary eclipses ( at the phase 0.506 for wy  cet and 0.509 for uw  cyg ) when the light contribution from the secondary component is minimal , therefore the spectra practically correspond to the primaries .",
    "all spectra were calibrated and normalized to enable direct comparisons .",
    "then , we shifted the spectra , using h@xmath13 as reference , to compensate for the relative doppler shifts of each standard .",
    "the variables spectra were subtracted from those of each standard , deriving sums of squared residuals in each case .",

    "ep  mon , ey  ori , ft  ori and v536  ori were re - observed in this way , but the results were negative ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "lcs of eight systems including an oscillating component were analyzed in order to derive their physical , geometrical and pulsational characteristics .",
    "a semi - detached configuration turned out for all systems , except for hz  dra that was found to be detached .",
    "their primaries were identified as ms @xmath0  scuti - like pulsators , therefore , according to the definition suggested by @xcite , all systems , except for hz  dra , can be considered as oea stars .    for cz",
    "aqr evidence supporting mass transfer was not detected in the o@xmath1c analysis , neither was any third light indicated in the lc fittings .",
    "the mass transfer might be at a starting / ending phase , so that the rate could be too small to be detected .",
    "the third body , according to its minimal mass and assuming its ms nature , should contribute less than 1% to the total light , therefore its non - detection is reasonable .. on the other hand , the quadrupole moment of the secondary component ( 1.4@xmath22  g  @xmath23 ) can also account for cyclic orbital period changes .",
    "one pulsation frequency with relatively small amplitude was found for the primary component .",
    "mass transfer from the secondary to the primary component of ty  cap is supported by both lc and o@xmath1c analyses .",
    "the detected third light had a value of @xmath123% , while the minimal mass found for the tertiary component ( 0.64  @xmath24 ) suggests @xmath121% light contribution to the total light , as can be derived from the mass - luminosity relation ( @xmath25 ) for the ms stars .",
    "therefore , we conclude that these results are mutually supportive for the triplicity of the system",
    ". alternatively , the 4.4@xmath22 g  @xmath23 value of @xmath26 could be consistent with a possible applegate - type mechanism .",
    "for the ms component of the system two oscillation frequencies were detected .    for wy  cet the o@xmath1c and lc analyses are consistent with mass flow from the less to the more massive component , while the detected third light was found to be @xmath121% .",
    "the light contribution of a ms star having the derived minimal mass is expected to be @xmath124% .",
    "this disagreement questions the existence of the third body or its possible ms nature .",
    "plausibly , observed cyclic changes of the eb s period can be explained as magnetic influences of the secondary component ( @xmath27  g  @xmath23 ) .",
    "the frequency analysis resulted in one oscillating mode for the system s primary component .",
    "the o@xmath1c analysis of uw  cyg yielded two cyclic orbital period variations , while the detected additional light was found @xmath121% .",
    "the values of quadrupole moment s variation of the secondary component were found to support both orbital period s cyclic changes . on the other hand ,",
    "the hypothetical fourth body was found to have a minimal mass of @xmath120.6  @xmath24 , which can explain the observed additional light contribution , assuming its ms nature . to sum up",
    ", the most possible explanation for the double periodic behaviour of the system s orbital period seems to be the secondary component s magnetic quadrupole moment variation with a period of about 82  yr and the existence of a tertiary companion with a period of @xmath1230  yr .",
    "no parabolic term in the o@xmath1c solution was found , showing that the mass transfer rate is too weak to be detected in the current data set .",
    "for the primary component two low amplitude frequencies were traced .",
    "for hz  dra we found one , for hl  dra and cl  lyn three and for au  lac two pulsationfrequencies .    taking into account only the reliable cases of binaries containing a @xmath0  sct star ,",
    "three new empirical relations connecting pulsation and orbital periods are proposed .",
    "these relations are certainly not the final ones due to the rather small sample . in coming years",
    "it is expected that the sample will be enriched significantly and more detailed relationships between pulsation and orbital periods will be tested .",
    "the pulsating members of oea systems , as distinct from the ones in detached , are mass accreting and the mass flow on their surface should affect the pulsations @xcite .",
    "our results showed that the @xmath0  sct stars in near contact systems present slightly slower pulsations than the ones in detached binaries for a given orbital period .",
    "the majority of the binary members-@xmath0  sct stars lie inside the ms band and closer to the zams limit , indicating that their instability starts at early stages of their evolution in comparison with the singles .",
    "another significant conclusion is the relation connecting the evolutionary stage of a @xmath0  sct star member of a close binary with its dominant pulsation frequency .",
    "a closer examination of this , reveals that the older the star the slower the pulsations .",
    "although this is already known for single pulsators , a new correlation between evolutionary stage and dominant pulsation frequency for binary - members @xmath0  sct stars is introduced in the present study , which was found to differ significantly from that for the respective singles .",
    "80% of @xmath0  sct in binaries pulsate with periods shorter than 2  hr @xcite , while the majority of single @xmath0  sct stars ( 68% ) have periods in the range of 1.2 - 3.6  hr @xcite .",
    "clearly , pulsating members of binaries follow a different evolutionary track than classical ones as it was firstly pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the current sample includes mostly mass gaining @xmath0  sct stars and it seems that the mass accretion plays an essential role in the star s pulsation frequency decrease rate , in a way that the star pulsates faster than if it was single for a given evolutionary stage .",
    "future discoveries of binaries containing @xmath0  sct components will increase the current sample to better test possible dependence of the pulsational behaviour on the mass exchange .",
    "moreover , a physical interpretation of the empirical relations correlating the pulsation and orbital periods , and the pulsation period with the evolutionary stage of the @xmath0  sct components in close binaries is certainly needed .",
    "future theoretical modelling for mass gaining @xmath0  sct stars should take into account quantities such as mass , radius , mass transfer rate , radius expansion rate and dominant pulsation period .",
    "hence , the combination of theoretical models and current observational results is expected to answer a lot of open questions , enriching our knowledge about stellar evolution near the end of the main sequence phase .",
