    "as soon as kuhn understood the flexibility of polymer chains , and the origin of rubber elasticity , his student a.  katchalsky thought about the possibility of transforming chemical energy into mechanical energy , using gels swollen by water .",
    "his first idea is explained on fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "starting from chains which carry acid groups @xmath0 and adding @xmath1 ions , one obtains a charged network @xmath2 where the chains stretch by electrostatic repulsions .",
    "if one then adds @xmath3 , the system returns to neutral , and the gel contracts .",
    "[ h ]    pgg1nov.eps    this system , however , does not allow for many cycles .",
    "adding @xmath1 really means adding soda @xmath4 and adding @xmath3 means adding hydrochloric acid @xmath5 .  at each cycle ,",
    "one thus adds one mole of @xmath6 , and this ionic solute screens  out the electrostatic interactions : the system dies out fast .",
    "katchalsky solved this problem by an intelligent trick : he used ion exchange @xmath7 against @xmath8 where @xmath9 binds  two @xmath2 groups and contracts the gel .",
    "his group produced active fibers of this type@xcite @xmath10 however , the process did not gave rise to useful applications , for a number of reasons :    \\1 ) time constants : what is implied here is diffusion of ions  from a bath to a fiber , and diffusion is always very slow . and",
    "even if the ions were injected locally ( by highly divided electrodes , or , by conducting polymers ) the diffusion of water remains necessary to swell or deswell .",
    "\\2 ) fatigue : if we swell a gel by water , the swelling process starts at the outer surface , and creates huge mechanical tensions in a thin region : buckling instabilities occur@xmath11 and fractures show up .  there is little hope for an artificial muscle which breaks locally at each cycle .    in the following section",
    ", we present two attempts where these difficulties are taken into account",
    ".  it may well be that none of them gives a durable answer , but the trends are interesting .",
    "the starting point here is a nematic network schematized on fig.[fig2 ] . at low temperatures ,",
    "the system is elongated .  at higher temperatures , above the nematic isotropic transition point @xmath12 , the network contracts .",
    "networks of this type have been synthetised by a very intelligent technique @xcite .",
    "[ h ]    pgg2nov.eps    of course , thermal effects have their difficulties : the diffusion of heat is faster than the diffusion of solvents , but is still slow .",
    "this led us to think about a _ semi - fast _ system@xcite@xmath13 here we heat up rapidly the system by a light pulse ( having some adsorbing dyes inside ) and induce  the nematic isotropic transition .",
    "the contraction time of rubber in a sling -is related to the velocity of shear waves in the rubber , and is typically of order 1 millisecond .",
    "when we want to close the cycle , we have to cool down the sample ( by a few degrees ) and this takes a long time ( seconds ) .  but this semi fast actuator might be of some use .",
    "to avoid fatigue , we conceived a system based on block copolymers ( fig.[fig3 ] ) which is hopefully well protected .",
    "the fabrication of these sophisticated copolymers requires artistic chemistry , and is under way@xcite@xmath10    [ h ]    pgg3nov.eps",
    "a completely different approach has been used by m.  shahinpoor and coworkers @xcite@xmath10 here , the basic material is commercially available , cheap , and robust .",
    "it is a  nafion  : a fluoropolymer containing some fixed @xmath14 groups plus @xmath15 counterions and small water pockets which are inter connected ( fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "shahinpoor was able to set up electrodes , with large contact areas , on both sides of a thin nafion sheet , by formation of platinum nanoparticles .",
    "when such a sheet is put under a mild voltage ( @xmath161 volt ) it deforms as shown on fig[fig5 ] .",
    "the basic process appears to be simple .  when a @xmath15 ion moves , it drags some water with it towards the cathode : thus the cathode swells , while the anode contracts .",
    "the features can be described rather simply (",
    "like all electro osmosis effects ) in terms of two coupled fluxes ( normal to the plate ) : the electric current @xmath17 and the water flux @xmath18 the corresponding forces are the electric field @xmath19 and the pressure gradient @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22            one can construct order of magnitude estimates for the various coefficients .  for the very small pores of interest here ,",
    "the standard ( smoluchow ski ) description of electro osmosis is not very adequate .",
