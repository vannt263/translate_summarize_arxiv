    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) have been widely regarded as the most attractive candidate for dark matter ( dm ) in the universe .",
    "they are weakly coupled to the standard model ( sm ) particles so that they are thermalized in the early universe .",
    "their relic abundance is determined by their annihilation cross sections , and it turns out that wimps may have a correct value of the cross sections to give the observed dm density @xmath6  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "such particles are often predicted in new physics beyond the sm .",
    "for instance , the lightest neutralino in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is a well - know candidate for wimp dm .    since wimps are interacting with the ordinary matters , it is possible to use these interactions to detect them directly .",
    "experiments based on such a strategy are called the dm direct detection experiments .",
    "these experiments search for the scattering signals of wimps kicking off target nuclei on the earth by detecting the recoil energy transferred to the nuclei . at present , the lux experiment has the best sensitivity , and provides a limit on the spin - independent wimp ",
    "nucleon scattering cross section as @xmath7 at a mass of 33  gev @xcite .",
    "further , there exist several proposals with ton - scale detectors , which will offer extremely improved sensitivities .    to study the properties of wimps based on the direct detection experiments , it is necessary to evaluate the wimp - nucleus scattering cross sections accurately .",
    "the interactions of a wimp with a nucleon , as well as a nucleus , are generated through the couplings of the wimp with quarks and gluons .",
    "these couplings are described in terms of the parton - level interactions , and contribute to the interactions with a nucleon through non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "an appropriate way to compute the contribution is to take an effective theoretical approach . here , the parton - level interactions are expressed by the higher - dimensional operators , and their contribution to the wimp - nucleon couplings is computed by means of their nucleon matrix elements .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for the treatments .",
    "usually , the parton - level interactions are mediated by heavy particles .",
    "since the wimps are singlet with respect to the su(3)@xmath8u(1)@xmath9 symmetry , the particles mediating the wimp - quark interactions should be also electrically neutral and color singlet when they are exchanged in the @xmath10-channel , while they should be charged and colored when they are exchanged in the @xmath11- or @xmath12-channel .",
    "the extent of the significance of these contributions highly depends on models .",
    "for example , in the case of the neutralino dm in the mssm , the @xmath13 boson and the higgs boson mediating processes are classified into the former type , while the squark exchange is the latter one . when squarks are extremely heavy , only the former contribution is sizable . in the limit of pure gaugino or higgsino case ,",
    "on the other hand , the former contribution vanishes and thus the latter may be dominant .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to construct a formalism to evaluate all of the contributions precisely enough on an equal footing .",
    "recently , the lhc experiments give stringent limits on the masses of new colored particles .",
    "the results may suggest that the colored mediators which induce the couplings of wimps with quarks and gluon , if they exist , should have masses much heavier than @xmath14  gev . in this case",
    ", the contribution of such a particle to the wimp - nucleon interaction receives sizable qcd corrections because of the mass hierarchy and the large value of the strong coupling constant .",
    "this motivates us to reformulate the calculation in the following way ; first , we obtain the effective theory which consists of the higher dimensional operators of dm and quarks / gluons at the energy scale of the mediator mass . at this point , we need to match the effective theory to the full theory so that only the short - distance contribution is to be included in the wilson coefficients of the higher - dimensional operators . then , we evolve the operators by using the renormalization group equations ( rges ) down to the scale at which the nucleon matrix elements of the operators are evaluated .",
    "it is the prescription that we will discuss in this paper .",
    "we will formulate a complete framework to carry out the calculation to the leading order in the strong coupling constant . in this formulation , all of the model dependence",
    "is included into the wilson coefficients of the effective operators , and the rest part of the steps is independent of models .",
    "therefore , the method is quite suitable for generic computational codes such as micromegas @xcite or darksusy @xcite .",
    "in addition , we will discuss in detail the treatment for the twist-2 operators and show that we do not have to evolve the operators down to the hadronic scale ( @xmath15  gev ) ; we may evaluate their nucleon matrix elements around the electroweak scale . this point is often misunderstood , and we believe that our analysis clarifies the confusion . furthermore , we will show the significance of the renormalization effects on the operators when the masses of the colored mediators are much heavier than the electroweak scale .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : majoranadm ] , we discuss our formulation in the case where dm is a majorana fermion .",
    "we present the effective operators for the majorana fermion and evaluate the matching conditions on their wilson coefficients .",

    "the results for the real scalar and vector boson dm cases are also given in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion . in appendix",
    ", we present the formulae for the one - loop contribution to the scalar - type gluon operators in the case of scalar dm , which as far as we know have not been given in the literature so far .",
    "the result is useful when the colored mediators have masses around the electroweak scale .",
    "in this section , we give a formalism to evaluate the scattering cross sections of a wimp with a nucleon .",
    "the procedure described here consists of the following steps .",
    "first , we construct the effective theory for the wimp , quarks , and gluons , by integrating out the mediator particles .",
    "the effective interactions obtained here are expressed in terms of the higher - dimensional operators .",
    "then , we evolve the wilson coefficients of the effective operators according to the rges down to the scale at which the nucleon matrix elements of the operators are evaluated . finally , we express the effective coupling of the wimp with a nucleon in terms of the wilson coefficients and the nucleon matrix elements .",
    "the scattering cross sections are readily obtained from the effective coupling .",
    "we will evaluate them to the leading order in the strong coupling constant throughout this work .    in this section , we assume that the wimp dm to be a majorana fermion .",
    "the real scalar boson dm and the real vector boson dm cases are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : realscalardm ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : realvectordm ] , respectively .",
    "it should be noted that dirac fermion and complex scalar dm candidates are severely constrained by the dm direct detection experiments because they in general couple to the vector current of quark fields .",
    "furthermore , this vector interaction is not renormalized , and thus the conventional way of calculation is sufficient for this contribution @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , we do not consider these cases in this paper .      to begin with ,",
    "let us write down the effective interactions of a majorana fermion , which is assumed to be a wimp , with quarks and gluon .",
    "the interactions are expressed in terms of the following higher - dimensional operators @xcite : @xmath16 with @xmath17 here , we only keep the operators that remain sizable in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "in addition , we have used the classical equations of motion and the integration by parts to drop the redundant operators @xcite .",

    "we follow the convention used in ref .  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath28 with @xmath29 the covariant derivatives .",
    "the effective operators are defined at the mass scale of mediators , which is assumed to be well above the mass of top quark .",
    "generalization to other cases is straightforward ; for instance , if such heavy particles have masses similar to or lighter than the top mass , one should integrate top quark as well so that the effective theoretical approach is appropriate .- quark mass . in this case , of course , @xmath30-quark ( also top quark ) should be simultaneously integrated out when the effective theory is formulated.[gondolo ] ]    note that we include @xmath31 to the definition of the gluon scalar - type operator @xmath32 .",
    "we discuss the meaning in the next subsection .      as discussed in introduction , we need the nucleon matrix elements of the effective operators to evaluate the wimp - nucleon effective coupling .",
    "these operators are classified into three types in terms of the lorentz transformation properties of the quark bilinear parts in the operators ; the scalar - type operators ( @xmath33 , @xmath32 ) , the axial - vector operator ( @xmath34 ) , and the twist-2-type operators ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",

    "the results indicate that it is important to include the rge effects , especially when the colored mediators are much heavier than the electroweak scale .",
    "so far we have discussed a way of evaluating the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section at the leading order in @xmath49 based on the effective theoretical approach .",
    "we have considered a majorana fermion , real scalar and vector bosons , and presented formulation for each case .",
    "further , using a particular example with a majorana fermion , we have shown that the renormalization effects may change the twist-2 contribution by more than 50% when the colored mediators are much heavier than the electroweak scale , which results in modification to the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section by @xmath165% .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twist2mz2gev ] , the calculation of the twist-2 contribution suffers from @xmath165% uncertainty due to the perturbation in @xmath49 .",
    "it is possible to reduce the uncertainty by going beyond the leading - order calculation .",
    "in fact , we have already had the higher - order results for the rges and the matching conditions at each quark threshold , as commented in sec .",
    "[ sec : rges ] . to complete the next - to - leading order computation , however , we further need the higher - order matching conditions between the full and effective theories at the input scale .",
    "we defer the calculation as future work .",
    "in addition , we expect that future lattice qcd simulations will much improve the determination of the quark content in nucleon .",
    "these two developments will enable us to evaluate the wimp - nucleon scattering cross sections with great accuracy .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that the prescription for the computation of the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section discussed in this paper is quite systematic , and the formulation itself is almost model - independent .",
    "the model - dependence is included in the wilson coefficients at the factorization scale , and the subsequent procedure is similar in every case .",
    "therefore , this method is suitable to be used in general computational codes for the direct detection rate of dm , such as micromegas @xcite and darksusy @xcite .",
