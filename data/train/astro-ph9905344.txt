    "the star ls  5039 is the most likely optical counterpart to the x - ray source rx  j1826.2@xmath01450 .",
    "such an association was originally proposed by motch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , hereafter m97 , as a result of a systematic cross - correlation between the rosat all sky survey ( voges et al . 1996 ) and several ob star catalogues in the simbad database .",
    "the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity , at an estimated distance of 3.1 kpc , amounts to @xmath1(0.12.4  kev )  @xmath2  8.1@xmath310@xmath4  erg  s@xmath5 , and the hardness of the source is well consistent with a neutron star or a black hole , accreting directly from the companion s wind ( m97 ) . in the optical , ls  5039",
    "appears as a bright @xmath6  11.2 star with an o7 v((f ) ) spectral type . based on this evidence ,",
    "m97 proposed the system to be a high mass x - ray binary ( hmxrb ) .",
    "in addition , this system has been found to be active at radio wavelengths .",
    "its radio counterpart ( nvss  j182614@xmath0145054 ) is a bright , compact and moderately variable radio source in excellent sub - arcsecond agreement with the optical star ( mart et al .",
    "all these facts point to the peculiar nature of rx  j1826.2@xmath01450/ls  5039 , and suggest a classification among the selected group of radio emitting hmxrb .    in order to explore how this source behaves compared to other members of its class ( e.g. , and ) ,",
    "we have analyzed the corresponding x - ray data from the all sky monitor ( asm ) and the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the satellite rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) . in sect .",
    "[ timing ] we present an x - ray timing analysis based on both the asm and the pca instruments .",
    "the asm data are suitable to study the long - term ( days to months ) temporal behavior of the source , whereas x - ray variability on shorter time scales ( seconds to hours ) is better investigated with the pca . in sect .",
    "[ spectral ] a pca spectroscopic analysis is presented , with the different spectral models that fit the data being examined and discussed .    in the radio domain ,",
    "rx  j1826.2@xmath01450/ls  5039 was included at our request in the list of radio sources routinely monitored at the green bank interferometer ( gbi ) . at the time of writing , the radio light curves cover @xmath2  4 months of observations . in sect .",
    "[ radio ] we present the gbi radio data so far acquired with some discussion on the source variability and spectral index properties .",
    "finally , we conclude in sect .",
    "[ comparison ] with a brief comparative discussion of rx  j1826.2@xmath01450/ls  5039 versus other radio loud hmxrb .",
    "hereafter , we will refer to the source as rx  j1826.2@xmath01450 when discussing the x - rays . in the optical / radio context",
    "the ls  5039 designation will be preferred .",
    "the asm database analyzed in this paper spans for more than two and a half years ( 1996 february1998 november ) and contains nearly 800 daily flux measurements in the energy range 1.512 kev .",
    "each data point represents the one - day average of the fitted source fluxes from a number ( typically 5 - 10 ) of individual asm dwells , of @xmath2 90 s each ( see levine et al .",
    "1996 for more details ) .",
    "the one - day average light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ asm_lc ] . the big gap between modified julian date ( mjd ) @xmath2  50400 and @xmath2  50500 corresponds to the passage of the sun close to the source during the first year of observations .",
    "this gap repeats the following two years ( near mjd 50800 and 51150 ) , but it happens to be less severe and a few flux measurements were then possible .",
    "most of time , the source is at the threshold of asm detectability .",
    "nevertheless , we have searched for possible periodicities in the range from 2 to 200 d. the methods employed were the phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ) ( stellingwerf 1978 ) and the clean algorithm ( roberts et al .",
    "our approach here is essentially the same as in paredes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) when analyzing the periodic behavior in the x - ray light curve of ls  i+61@xmath7303 .    after applying both the pdm and clean methods to the asm data , a period of @xmath2  52.7",
    "d stands prominently .",
    "this periodicity corresponds to the detection of some kind of active events that appear rather evident at first glance in fig .",
    "[ asm_lc ] .",
    "nevertheless , a careful inspection of the data reveals a suspicious detail .",
    "all those active events take place when the data by dwell coverage is rather poor ( less than 5 dwells per day ) , thus reducing the statistical significance of the corresponding one - day average . for some instrumental reason ,",
    "the asm coverage becomes poorer than normal every @xmath2  53 d or so and , in the case of a weak x - ray source like rx  j1826.2@xmath01450 , this can affect somehow the period analysis .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2  52.7 d period is very likely to be an instrumental artifact . indeed , after removing all daily points resulting from less than 5 dwells ( @xmath2  20% of total ) , the timing analysis reveals no significant period in the range from 2 to 200 d.      additional observations were made with the pca instrument on 1998 february 8 and 16 .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 20 ks .",
    "the pca is sensitive to x - rays in the energy range 260 kev and comprises five identical co - aligned gas - filled proportional counter units ( pcus ) , providing a total collecting area of @xmath2  6500 @xmath8 , an energy resolution of @xmath9 18 % at 6 kev and a maximum time resolution of 1@xmath10s . our analysis was carried out in the interval 330 kev since the pcu windows prevent the detection of photons below @xmath2  2.5 kev , whereas above 30 kev the spectrum becomes background dominated .",
    "good time intervals were defined by removing data taken at low earth elevation angle ( @xmath9 8@xmath7 ) and during times of high particle background .",
    "an offset of only 0.02@xmath7 between the source position and the pointing of the satellite was allowed , to ensure that any possible short stretch of slew data at the beginning and/or end of the observation was removed .",
    "table  [ tabx ] shows the journal of the pca observations , while the light curve of the entire observation is presented in fig .",
    "[ pca_lc ] .",
    ".[tabx ] log of the pca observation of rx  j1826.2@xmath01450 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ( * ) only data during quiescence has been considered + @xmath11 motch et al .",
    "1997 + @xmath12 penninx 1989 + @xmath13 frail & hjellming 1991 + @xmath14 vermeulen et al .",
    "ss  433 , ls  i+61@xmath7303 and the bhc cygnus  x-1 are classical examples of hmxrb with detectable radio emission ( penninx 1989 ) , and all of them are also under gbi monitoring . in order to facilitate the comparison of ls  5039 to these sources , we have summarized some relevant parameters in table  [ hmxrb ] .",
    "they include : the quiescent x - ray luminosity , as derived from asm / rxte data ( extrapolated from pca / rxte in the case of ls  5039 because the signal to noise ratio is much higher ) ; the weighted average radio luminosity and spectral index in quiescence , both based on gbi data ; the nature of the compact object ; the spectral type of the companion ; the orbital period of the binary system and the distance to the source .    as it can be seen in table  [ hmxrb ] , the radio luminosity of ls  5039 is very similar to that of cygnus  x-1 .",
    "this is , of course , provided that the distance adopted is correct .",
    "their respective spectral indices seem to be intrinsically different , both sources being persistent at radio wavelengths .",
    "cygnus  x-1 also experiences strong x - ray variability due to changes in its state , that we are not aware of in our source .",
    "the ls  i+61@xmath7303 radio properties during quiescence are also very comparable to those of ls  5039 , as well as their respective x - ray luminosities . in contrast , ls  i+61@xmath7303 undergoes radio outbursts every @xmath2  26.5  d , the orbital period of the system , while ls  5039 never had strong outbursts during the gbi observations .",
    "the x - ray and radio luminosities of ss  433 in quiescence are much higher than those of ls  5039 .",
    "however , we notice that their @xmath15 ratios are practically the same .    in general terms",
    ", the average properties of ls  5039 do not deviate extraordinarily from those of other radio loud hmxrb .",
    "since even the well accepted members of this class are not an homogeneous group , the belonging of ls  5039 to this category appears as very plausible to us .",
    "we have presented a general overview of the x - ray and radio emission properties of the massive x - ray binary rx  j1826.2@xmath01450/ls  5039 .",
    "our x - ray and radio results are mostly based on long term ( few months ) monitorings of the source , with our main conclusions being :    1 .   in the x - rays",
    ", a timing analysis has been performed showing neither pulsed nor periodic emission on time scales of 0.022000 s and 2200 d , respectively .",
    "the x - ray spectrum has been found to be significantly hard ( up to 30 kev ) , with no cut - off required .",
    "it can be fitted satisfactorily with a power - law plus a strong gaussian iron line .",
    "2 .   at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the gbi monitoring confirms the long - term persistence of the rx  j1826.2@xmath01450/ls  5039 radio emission in time scales of months , always with a non - thermal synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the day - to - day variability continues to be moderate most of the time ( @xmath16  % ) , and no strong radio outbursts have been observed .",
    "3 .   the classification of rx  j1826.2@xmath01450/ls  5039 among the radio loud hmxrb group is reinforced .",
