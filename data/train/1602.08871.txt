    "@xmath0-decay is a quantum tunneling through coulomb barrier , which is forbidden by the classical mechanics .",

    "the theory of the fission process was given by meitner in 1939  @xcite . in this process",
    "a parent nucleus goes from the ground state to scission point through a deformation and then split into two daughter nuclei .",
    "this decay process can be described as an interplay between the nuclear surface energy  @xcite coming from the strong interaction and the coulomb repulsion .",
    "recently , uranium and thorium isotopes have attracted a great attention in nuclear physics due to the thermally fissile nature of some of their isotopes .",
    "these thermally fissile materials have tremendous importance in energy production . till date ,",
    "the known thermally fissile nuclei are @xmath6u , @xmath7u and @xmath8pu . out",
    "of which only @xmath7u has a long life time and the only thermally fissile isotope available in nature @xcite .",
    "thus , presently it is an important area of research to look for any other thermally fissile nuclei apart from @xmath6u , @xmath7u and @xmath8pu .",
    "interestingly , satpathy , patra and choudhury @xcite showed that uranium and thorium isotopes with neutron number n=154 - 172 have thermally fissile property .",
    "they show that these nuclei have low fission barrier with a significantly large barrier width , which makes stable against the spontaneous fission",
    ". as these nuclei are stable against spontaneous fission , thus the prominent decay modes may be the emission of @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-particles from the neutron - rich thermally fissile ( uranium and thorium ) isotopes .",

    "in this manuscript , we will discuss about various modes of decay encountered by superheavy nuclei both in the @xmath1-stability line as well as away from it .",

    "it is clear that the neutron and proton densities increase monotonically with increase of mass number a. the shell structure of the nucleus is clearly visible from the humps appeared in the central region of the density plot . in general",
    ", the density has an uniform spread for a large area , about 6 - 7 fm , which appears like a big drop of liquid .",
    "similar density distributions for uranium isotopes is also observed , which is not shown .",
    "the detailed internal structure can be more clear from the two - dimensional contour plot of the density , which are depicted in the subsequent subsections .",
    "the clusterization of nucleons inside the nucleus in the framework of rmf formalism is a bridge between microscopic and macroscopic(liquid drop ) picture . in liquid drop model , the nucleon moves inside the nucleus similar to the phenomenon of brownion motion . as a result ,",
    "one estimates the mean free path @xmath66 to be @xmath671.6 fm , i.e. the nucleon travels a distance of @xmath66 before it collides with another nucleon .",
    "although , the rmf formalism is based on the single - particle motion of nucleon , ( nucleons can be identified with the four quantum number ( nljm ) ) it behaves also as a liquid drop to some extent .",
    "because of this nature ( the liquid drop model ) , the nucleons form cluster in certain region of the nucleus , which we have estimated through the densities and given a rough estimation in table  [ tab1 ]",
    ". the densities are obtained from rmf(nl3 ) in the positive quadrant of the plane parallel to the symmetry z - axis .",

    "the spreading area of the depression is minimum , but this spreading goes on increasing with mass number . on the peripheral region of the nuclei , we observe few thin layers and finally a very diffuse layer of nucleons distribution is observed . in general , we did not see any uneven distribution of matter in some certain area of the nucleus .",
    "we only observe uniform distribution of nucleons in an area ruling out the possibility of formation of cluster inside the heavy nucleus , unlike to the situation of light nuclei @xcite .",
    "the only possibility is the existence of @xmath0-like matter inside the nucleus .",
