    "it is becoming widely recognized that universes with a nontrivial spatial topology may be more natural models for our universe than the traditional simply connected ones .",
    "this naturalness can be invoked from the mathematical point of view by arguing that there is an infinity of locally homogeneous and isotropic multiply connected 3spaces , while there are only three simply connected ones ; or with physical arguments coming from incursions into the nobody s territories of quantum gravity and quantum cosmology . on the other hand , from a more pragmatic point of view",
    ", we can argue that cosmological models with a nontrivial spatial topology offer a very rich field of research , and are particularly well suited to explain certain reported `` anomalous '' features in cmb temperature maps , such as the alignments of their low @xmath2modes @xcite .",
    "conversely , the full sky cmb temperature maps produced by the space missions cobe and wmap provide us with an amazingly rich and high quality amount of data with which we can look for the topology of space .",
    "this is very compelling for those who wish to unmask our universe and see its shape , since cosmic topology is at present an almost exclusively observational and phenomenological issue , due to the lack of an accepted fundamental physical theory which can predict the global topology of space",
    ".    theory demands topology of space to leave several different kinds of marks in cmb temperature maps .",
    "two of them have been largely studied and exploited to try to unveil the shape of our universe , the distorsion of the angular power spectrum with respect to that of a simply connected universe @xcite@xcite , and the existence of `` circles in the sky '' @xcite .",
    "two other closely related signatures , a non  null bipolar power spectrum @xcite , and alignments of the low @xmath2modes @xcite , have been only marginally used .",
    "our main motivation for deciding to adventure into cosmic topology with the cmb was the desire to get a deeper understanding of the nature and properties of these alignments as a topological signature .    one indispensable tool for a project like this is a software facility to produce simulated cmb temperature maps in multiply connected universes , so that we could systematically study the effects of different sizes and topologies on these alignments .",
    "these simulation procedures exist and have been used in several studies in cosmic topology @xcite , @xcite@xcite , so we could expect that this issue of the project would not present any problem .",
    "however , almost all known methods for computing cmb temperature anisotropies in multiply connected universes need to solve the helmholtz equation in the manifold modelling our 3dimensional space , the only exception to our knowledge being the work of bond et al .",
    "@xcite . to solve",
    "the helmholtz equation is a relatively easy problem in euclidean manifolds @xcite , but a very difficult task in spherical @xcite and hyperbolic 3spaces @xcite .",
    "indeed , the spherical case has been completely solved analitically only recently by lachize ",
    "rey @xcite , while for compact hyperbolic manifolds the only possible approach is numerical @xcite .    among other results , in this paper we present a new approach to the computation of the correlation matrix @xmath3 of the coefficients of the spherical harmonic decomposition of cmb temperature anisotropies in a universe with nontrivial spatial topology .",
    "the main feature of this approach is that it avoids the explicit computation of the solutions of the helmholtz equation in the spatial sections of spacetime .",
    "instead , we express the correlation matrix in terms of the covering group alone . incidentally , the idea of generating a cmb map exploiting the symmetries of the quotient space was already suggested time ago by janna levin and collaborators @xcite .",
    "in particular we wish to quote a citation of a nontrivial claim in @xcite ( p.2695 ) which we have , in our opinion , succeeded in achieving : `` by understanding the symmetries of the fundamental polyhedron and the identification rules , a cbr pattern can be deduced without the need to explicitly obtain the spectrum mode by mode . ''",
    "our main formal result is a generic decomposition of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 may be any covariance function which can be related to the two  point correlation function of the newtonian potential ( see sec .",
    "[ s : cycdec ] ) , @xmath6 is the covering group of ( the multiply connected ) space , @xmath7 stands for `` simply connected '' , and @xmath8 means `` topological signature '' .",
    "thus , in eq .",
    "( [ gendecomp ] ) , @xmath9 is the covariance function computed in the manifold @xmath10 , and @xmath11 the same covariance function but computed in the universal covering space @xmath12 .",
    "it means that all the topological information is encoded in the `` perturbative '' term @xmath13 , and that is why we refer to it , generically , as the topological signature of @xmath9 .",
    "this decomposition is always possible whenever one can express @xmath9 in terms of @xmath6 , as for example in the psh method for detecting multiple copies of standard candles @xcite . in the present case we succeeded in writing the correlation matrix of the @xmath14 s in this way by formally manipulating the two  point correlation function of the newtonian potential derived by bond , pogosyan and souradeep @xcite .",
    "our approach to compute the correlation matrix @xmath15 has some methodological advantages in the simulation of cmb temperature maps . indeed , by means of a suitable decomposition of the covering group @xmath6 in cyclic subgroups , we are able to write down a formula for the correlation matrix of a complicated topology in terms of the correlation matrices of the cyclic topologies ( topologies with a cyclic covering group ) that cover it maximally .",
    "since correlation matrices for cyclic manifolds are relatively easy to compute ( we obtain a closed quadrature formula for the cylinder ) , we expect to obtain in the near future more efficient ways to simulate maps for complicated manifolds .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath6 in cyclic subgroups describes in a transparent way the symmetries of the manifold , and this fact gives rise to another advantage of our approach , in this case from the observational side . universes with a cyclic topology",
    "present an alignment along the `` direction of the generator isometry '' .",
    "it follows that a cmb map in a universe with a nontrivial topology might present `` patterns of alignment '' ( one for each @xmath2mode ) characteristic of its shape and size . indeed , and this shall become `` obvious '' , symmetries of the quotient manifolds translate into symmetries of their patterns of alignment .",
    "we propose a method to search for these patterns by constructing maps of the dispersion of the squares @xmath16 around the power spectrum .",
    "this opens the door to the development of methods to look for topology by searching these patterns , instead of limiting ourselves to considerations concerning only the special directions defined by the alignments .",
    "for the sake of brevity , other advantages of our approach to compute the matrix @xmath17 are discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : discuss ] only .",
    "we prefer now to make a few remarks on some limitations of our work .",
    "we have considered here a few simplifications to develop the formalism , and worked out the details for the very simplest nontrivial topologies .",
    "in fact , we ( i ) have considered the sachs ",
    "wolfe effect as the only source of temperature anisotropies in cmb maps , ( ii ) have written the correlation matrix @xmath17 formally only for euclidean 3-spaces , ( iii ) have worked out the details for homogeneous flat manifolds , ( iv ) have made a detailed analysis and some simulations only for cylinders ( @xmath1 topology ) , and ( v ) these simulations were done using the einstein  de sitter model .",
    "we wish to close this introduction by justifying each one of these simplifications .",
    "the shape of space is a global property , thus we expect the topological signatures in cmb to show themselves on very large scales only .",
    "although a proof is missing , we believe that the main features of these signals would observationally appear if we restrict the searches to the low @xmath2modes in the temperature maps , i.e. , we do not need high resolution cmb maps in cosmic topology ! since the sachs ",
    "wolfe effect is the main source of temperature anisotropies at these scales @xcite , we expect that theoretical explorations considering only this effect will put in evidence the main features of the topological signals that we would observe in a real map .",
    "the addition of the missing part of the anisotropies will only modify quantitatively the predictions made with our approximation , and thus , will only be important when adjusting theoretical models with data .",
    "we consider this paper technically hard , so much care has been taken to write it in a clear and pedagogical way .",
    "the main features of our formalism and of the topological signatures we predict in cmb can be understood by restricting the presentation to euclidean topologies .",
    "the inclusion of nonzero spatial curvature will only introduce additional technical considerations ( and nothing qualitatively new ) , thus we decided to leave the spherical and hyperbolic cosmological models for a future paper .",
    "the same applies to the lack in the paper of detailed explicit correlation matrices for nonhomogeneous flat manifolds .",
    "indeed , the price we pay for simplicity and transparency in the presentation of the results for each specific cyclic topology is the need for very hard calculations in the middle steps , as can be seen in the appendices .",
    "explicit calculations for nonhomogeneous flat manifolds will only add one page to the main body of the paper , and one or two more appendices to the already large list of them ( see the end of the introduction ) .",
    "an exhaustive presentation for all the euclidean manifolds is left for a future work .    the last but not the least , we performed the simulations with the einstein  de sitter model for simplicity .",
    "nothing is lost from the theoretical point of view with this simplification since , as discussed in the paper , the structure of the topological signatures in cmb is captured in this oversimplified and old fashioned model of our universe .",
    "however , more realistic @xmath0cdm models will be required to confront theory with observations quantitatively .",
    "we close this introduction by giving a detailed description of the structure of the paper . in sec .",

    "[ s : cycdec ] ) , led to the discovery of a new topological signature in cmb temperature maps , i.e. , the `` patterns of alignment '' ( sec . [",

    "we compute a function that is the key part for computing efficiently the topological signature of the correlation matrix for the cylinder .",
    "finally , in appendix [ s : oldres ] we briefly reproduce known results for the correlation matrix of five out of the six compact orientable euclidean 3spaces .",
    "these formulae have been obtained previously in the literature by considering explicitly the solutions of the helmholtz equation in these manifolds , and are written in terms of the @xmath20modes @xcite .",
    "our derivation avoids the need for considering these solutions .",
    "in this section we briefly describe two methods currently available for simulating cmb temperature maps in universes with non  trivial spatial topology , and proceed to develop our own formulation .",
    "we consider @xmath0cdm universes , where the background metric of spacetime is of the robertson  walker type , and include scalar and adiabatic perturbations as the seeds for the temperature anisotropies of the cmb . in the newtonian gauge",

    "the matter content consists of radiation ( @xmath28 ) , baryonic and cold dark matter ( @xmath29 ) , and dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "since we are interested on fluctuations on large angular scales , we make the assumption of instantaneous recombination and do not consider finite thickness effects . the main contribution to",

    "the spatial part consists of solutions of the helmholtz equation @xmath41 where the index @xmath42 has been put as a variable in @xmath43 for simplicity of notation .",
    "the integral in eq .",
    "( [ sepvar ] ) has to be understood in a measure theoretic sense .",
    "indeed , for multiply connected spaces the measure @xmath44 is not the usual one but a combination of a discrete and an absolutely continuous measures , reducing the integral in ( [ sepvar ] ) to a sum and an integral in the usual sense . in particular ,",
    "if the space is compact , the measure reduces to a discrete one .",
    "this comes from the well  known fact that not every eigenmode of the laplacian operator in the universal covering space @xmath12 is also an eigenmode in a quotient space @xmath45 . in fact , only eigenmodes in @xmath12 satisfying the invariance conditions @xmath46 for any @xmath47 project to eigenmodes in @xmath48 .",
    "the most straightforward way of simulating cmb temperature maps is by solving ( [ temp ] ) and ( [ helmholtz ] ) , performing the sum in ( [ sepvar ] ) , and then evaluating the sw effect ( [ sw ] ) .",
    "however , one has to consider that a temperature anisotropy map is a realization of a random field on the 2sphere , and this randomness is inherited from that of the newtonian potential ( [ sepvar ] ) .",
    "there are currently two ways to implement this random character in the simulations , and one goal of this paper is to propose a third one .",
    "the first and most direct method is to consider the randomness in the temporal part of the decomposition ( [ sepvar ] ) of the newtonian potential .",
    "the two  point correlation function of the newtonian potential at fixed time @xmath22 can then be written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the two  point correlation function for the amplitudes of the scalar perturbation modes and @xmath51 are normalized solutions of the helmholtz equation .    assuming that the newtonian potential is a homogeneous and isotropic random field , the two point correlation function ( [ twopointaur ] ) reduces to a function of time @xmath22 and the distance @xmath52 , and thus we get @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the gravitational power spectrum .",
    "if , in addition , the newtonian potential is assumed to be gaussian , its random character is completely encoded in the variance of the temporal part @xmath55    specifying this function , one then takes as an initial condition , @xmath56 , a realization of a normal distribution with zero mean and variance given by eq .",
    "( [ variancetemp ] ) , and some suitable condition for the initial first derivative . with these initial conditions",
    "one solves for ( [ temp ] ) , so one can now compute the potential ( [ sepvar ] ) .",
    "topology is considered by restricting in ( [ sepvar ] ) to normalized solutions of the helmholtz equation satisfying the invariance conditions ( [ automorph ] ) .",
    "this method has been extensively used in @xcite , although in the former the authors do not consider the randomness of the function @xmath57 .",
    "instead the random character of the cmb maps is attributed exclusively to the random character of the eigenmodes of the laplacian in compact hyperbolic spaces .    the second method to produce simulated maps of cmb temperature anisotropies in universes with nontrivial spatial topology",
    "was first described in @xcite , and used in @xcite .",
    "it is based in considering the randomness of the newtonian potential in the eigenmodes of the laplacian operator .",
    "we begin by decomposing the general solution of the helmholtz equation , in the universal covering space , as a sum of fundamental solutions @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the normalized solution of the helmholtz equation after separating it in radial and angular variables . here",
    "we have put @xmath60 , @xmath31 is the unit vector in the direction of @xmath61 , and the @xmath62 are the spherical harmonic functions ( see appendix [ ap : sphharm ] ) .",
    "since the solutions ( [ helmradang ] ) are normalized , the randomness of the eigenmodes amplitudes relies on the coefficients @xmath63 .    introducing ( [ sepvar ] ) in ( [ sw ] ) , and using ( [ helmgen ] ) and ( [ helmradang ] )",
    ", we arrive at the decomposition of the temperature anisotropy map in spherical harmonics @xmath64 with multipole coefficients @xmath65 and the effects of physical cosmology given by @xmath66    at this point it is convenient to recall how does topology enter in the story .",
    "note that , due to the invariance conditions ( [ automorph ] ) , not every solution of the form ( [ helmgen ] ) is a solution in a quotient space .",
    "however , one would expect that any solution in a quotient space could be written in this form , the only problem being to find the correct coefficients @xmath63 .",
    "these coefficients are not independent one from the other , since the invariance conditions ( [ automorph ] ) establish certain relations among them .",
    "in what follows we will assume that these relations can always be found , so that we will always represent an eigenmode in a quotient space by eq .",
    "( [ helmgen ] ) , with suitable coefficients .",
    "a crucial point in @xcite is the decomposition of these coefficients as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the gravitational initial power spectrum , and the @xmath69 form a multivariate gaussian random variable , with a non  diagonal covariance matrix due to the relations among the coefficients @xmath63 coming from the invariance conditions .",
    "the simulation procedure can now be described .",
    "first we solve eq .",
    "( [ temp ] ) using the initial condition @xmath70 , and a suitable condition for the first derivative , and use this in ( [ gl(q ) ] ) to compute @xmath71 . then generate a realization of the random variable @xmath69 and use ( [ xi_decomp ] ) to compute @xmath63 .",
    "the map is now simulated by computing the coefficients @xmath14 using ( [ harmcoeff ] ) , and performing the sum in ( [ tempsphharm ] ) .    an alternative method of simulation , also proposed in @xcite , is to construct the covariance matrix of the @xmath14 s as @xmath72 the substitution of ( [ xi_decomp ] ) into ( [ covalmgen ] ) , and the evaluation of the resulting integral give rise to expressions for the covariance matrix in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the laplacian operator .",
    "the multipolar coefficients are then obtained directly as a realization of a gaussian distribution with zero mean and covariance given by ( [ covalmgen ] ) .",
    "the method we propose in this paper lies along these lines , but we are able to manipulate the correlation function for the @xmath63 in a way that avoids the need for an explicit determination of the eigenmodes of the laplacian . instead",
    ", the final expression after the integration of ( [ covalmgen ] ) is given in terms of the isometries of the corresponding covering group .",
    "our starting point is an expression , obtained by bond et al . in @xcite ,",
    "that relates the two  point correlation function of the newtonian potential in a simply connected universe , and that in a multiply connected universe , when both potentials have the same initial power spectrum . for a homogeneous and isotropic random field",
    "the expression is @xmath73 where @xmath74 if @xmath75 is orientation preserving , and @xmath76 otherwise .",
    "we now show how to use eq .",

    "especifically , we define the topological signature of any covariance function that can be decomposed as @xmath100 as for example , the two  point correlation function of the newtonian potential and the correlation matrix @xmath101",
    ". then we work out a suitable decomposition of a covering group in their cyclic subgroups , and write down the topological signature in terms of this decomposition .",

    "it is now obvious that this decomposition will be particularly useful for calculating the correlation matrix of the @xmath14 s for any compact manifold once we know how to calculate it for cyclic flat ( twisted cylinders ) , spherical ( lens spaces ) , and hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "let us now show that the decomposition ( [ deccyclic ] ) describes transparently the symmetries of the quotient manifold @xmath157 .",
    "actually , this decomposition contains the symmetries of the dirichlet fundamental polyhedron of @xmath48 centered at the observer s position @xmath158 , which is what one expects to reconstruct with cosmological observations .",
    "recall that the dirichlet fundamental polyhedron centered at @xmath158 is the set @xmath159 defined by ( see @xcite ) @xmath160 the first thing to be noted is that , although the whole covering group enters in this definition , it turns out that , in order to effectively construct the dirichlet polyhedron , we only need the minimal distance generators ( and maybe the first few positive powers ) of the first few cyclic groups @xmath148 and their inverses .",
    "in fact , for each @xmath47 consider the semi ",
    "space @xmath161 then it is obvious that the dirichlet polyhedron is the intersection of all of these semi  spaces .",

    "above , for a sufficiently large @xmath168 , it may be the case that the semi ",

    "the faces of the dirichlet polyhedron are subsets of the boundary planes of the semi  spaces effectively contributing to it .",
    "in fact , for each @xmath166 effectively contributing , the corresponding face is orthogonal to the geodesic joining @xmath123 and @xmath170 , and cuts it at its middle point .",

    "we have seen in the previous section that , to compute the topological signature of cmb temperature anisotropies in a given manifold , we just need to know how to compute it for the cyclic manifolds that cover it maximally . in the flat orientable case",
    "the cyclic manifolds are twisted cylinders , i.e. , manifolds with covering group generated by a screw motion .",
    "we will now focus on the simplest case , the flat homogeneous manifolds , which are generated by translations only .",

    "it is convenient to recall here that our cylinder has injectivity radius equal to @xmath180 , thus cylinders with @xmath181 are `` small '' and might present topological copies of discrete sources and/or circles in the sky . on the other hand , `` large '' cylinders , i.e. , those with @xmath182 , have undetectable topology with the methods currently available @xcite .",
    "the covering group of the cylinder is labeled by the integers as @xmath183 , with @xmath184 .",
    "we then have from ( [ deftopsign ] ) that all the topological information is encoded in @xmath185 and thus the correlation matrix of the @xmath14 s for the cylinder is simply    @xmath186    to reduce this integral we may use any of the following two identities , either @xmath187 or @xmath188 the first identity is obvious since the left hand side is the fourier expansion of the right hand side .",

    "[ ss : cylinder ] , these `` perturbations '' are small , the efficiency of the calculation follows .",
    "the second decomposition given by ( [ dectscyclic ] ) allows us to write the topological signature of any manifold in terms of the topological signatures of its maximal covering manifolds with cyclic covering groups .",
    "the example of the tori illustrates the power of this approach , since we can write down explicit formulae for a general torus whether its generating translations are orthogonal and/or equal . trying to do this with the explicit use of eigenfunctions of the laplacian ( or with the method used in appendix [ s : oldres ] ) turns out to be tedious if not difficult .",
    "moreover , by construction , this decomposition is invariant under the symmetries of the manifold , thus it carries information on how shall these symmetries manifest in individual cmb temperature anisotropy maps , as will be discussed in sec .",

    "it makes explicit that the multipole alignments observed in cobe and wmap full sky cmb temperature maps may be a manifestation of its global shape , provides details of the nature and features of these alignments , and gives at least one methodology to test this hypothesis . as a consequence ,",
    "further work is much needed .",
    "one line of further research is the implementation of our formalism in the spherical and hyperbolic cases .",
    "one way to do this requires first to identify the radial part of the fundamental solution ( [ helmradang ] ) of the helmholtz equation in the universal covering , as well as the analog of the `` plane wave expansion '' solution ( [ solhelmeuc ] ) in these geometries , and to write the expansion of the corresponding `` plane waves '' in spherical harmonics as in ( [ planew ] ) .",
    "the difficult part seems to be expressing the `` plane wave expansion '' in a suitable form to reproduce the formal steps used in the euclidean case .",

    "in fact , this is the source of the statistical anisotropy of the cmb in these universes .",

    "a natural question raises up : at what typical scales does the correlation matrix `` becomes diagonal '' ? in terms of our formalism this problem can be stated as finding the scales at where the topological signature becomes observationally negligible compared to the simply connected part .",

    "we first observe ( see appendix [ ap : sphharm ] ) that the function @xmath298 , given by ( [ pllmdef ] ) , is an even polynomial of @xmath380degree . thus , we begin by considering the integral @xmath381 where @xmath382 is an even analytical function . integrating succesively by parts we get @xmath383 \\ ; , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath384 is the @xmath20th derivative of @xmath385 .",

    "in this section we briefly show how we can obtain the formulae for the correlation matrix of the @xmath14 s and the angular power spectrum , currently available in the literature , for some closed flat manifolds , as well as a simple generalization , i.e. , considering the observer out of the axis of rotations of the screw motions of the covering group .",
    "we present explicit derivations and formulae for the correlation matrix @xmath395 , as well as for the power spectrum , in order to allow the interested reader to perform their own simulations confidently .",
    "we first give a brief description of flat orientable closed 3manifolds and their covering groups .",

    "there are six diffeomorphic classes of compact orientable euclidean 3manifolds .",
    "the generators for the covering groups of the first five classes , @xmath396 , are @xmath397 , @xmath398 and @xmath399 , where @xmath400 is the identity and @xmath401 for the classes @xmath396 respectively .",
    "it is important to remark that these matrices for the rotations are written in the basis formed by the set @xmath402 of linearly independent vectors .",
    "thus , the torus @xmath403 is generated by three independent translations , while for the other manifolds the generators are two independent translations and a screw motion along a linearly independent direction .",
    "the manifold @xmath404 is the most involved since their generators are all screw motions . in the following",
    "we present some general considerations concerning the classes @xmath396 only",
    ".      1 .",
    "the vector @xmath406 is orthogonal to both @xmath407 and @xmath408 .",
    "[ angle ] the angle between @xmath407 and @xmath408 is a free parameter for the class @xmath409 , while its value is fixed to be @xmath410 , @xmath254 and @xmath411 for the classes @xmath412 , @xmath413 and @xmath414 respectively .",
    "3 .   denoting by @xmath415 the length of the vector @xmath406 , and similarly for any other vector",
    ", one has that @xmath416 for the classes @xmath417 , while both lengths are independent free parameters in the class @xmath409 .",
    "moreover , in all classes @xmath405 , @xmath415 is an independent free parameter .",
    "4 .   denoting the canonical unitary basis vectors in euclidean space by @xmath418 , one can always write @xmath419 , and @xmath420 , for the basis @xmath402 , where @xmath19 is the angle between @xmath407 and @xmath408 , as established in the item [ angle ] .    thus in dealing with manifolds of classes @xmath405 , the axis of rotation of the generator screw motion",
    "can be taken to be the @xmath173axis , and the orthogonal part of this generator , in the basis @xmath421 , is @xmath422 with @xmath423 , @xmath410 , @xmath254 and @xmath411 respectively .",
    "since the axis of rotation passes through the origin , the translational part of the generator @xmath424 is @xmath425 , where we have put @xmath426 as is usual in cosmic topology .",
    "however , in cosmological applications we need to consider the arbitrariness of the position of the observer inside space . thus if the axis of rotation is at a distance @xmath427 from the origin ( the observer ) , and its intersection with the horizontal plane makes an angle @xmath428 with the positive @xmath368axis , the translational part of the screw motion @xmath429 is @xmath430 \\ , { \\widehat{{\\mathbf{e}}}_{x } } + \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{0.3 cm } \\rho",

    "the problem is trivial , since the covering group is generated by three independent translations , and thus any two isometries commute ( see sec.[ss : g1 ] below ) , while the covering groups for the other closed flat manifolds are noncommutative since they contain screw motions .",
    "the generators of the covering groups for the classes @xmath405 satisfy certain relations of the form @xmath431 where @xmath432 , and they hold whether the axis of rotation passes through the origin or not .",
    "it follows that a generic isometry can always be put in the form @xmath433 with @xmath434 , @xmath435 , and @xmath436 where @xmath437 is given by ( [ rot ] ) , @xmath438 , @xmath439 , with @xmath42 and @xmath440 integers such that @xmath441 , the parameter @xmath324 being @xmath442 and 6 corresponding to @xmath409 , @xmath412 , @xmath413 and @xmath414 respectively , @xmath443 @xmath444 , and @xmath445 \\ , { \\widehat{{\\mathbf{e}}}_{x } } + \\rho [ \\sin \\phi - \\sin(\\phi + \\alpha ) ] \\ , { \\widehat{{\\mathbf{e}}}_{y}}$ ] .",

    "<S> we propose an alternative formalism to simulate cmb temperature maps in @xmath0cdm universes with nontrivial spatial topologies . </S>",
    "<S> this formalism avoids the need to explicitly compute the eigenmodes of the laplacian operator in the spatial sections . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the covariance matrix of the coefficients of the spherical harmonic decomposition of the temperature anisotropies is expressed in terms of the elements of the covering group of the space . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a decomposition of the correlation matrix that isolates the topological contribution to the cmb temperature anisotropies out of the simply connected contribution . </S>",
    "<S> a further decomposition of the topological signature of the correlation matrix for an arbitrary topology allows us to compute it in terms of correlation matrices corresponding to simpler topologies , for which closed quadrature formulae might be derived . </S>",
    "<S> we also use this decomposition to show that cmb temperature maps of ( not too large ) multiply connected universes must show `` patterns of alignment '' , and propose a method to look for these patterns , thus opening the door to the development of new methods for detecting the topology of our universe even when the injectivity radius of space is slightly larger than the radius of the last scattering surface . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate all these features with the simplest examples , those of flat homogeneous manifolds , i.e. , tori , with special attention given to the cylinder , i.e. , @xmath1 topology . </S>"
