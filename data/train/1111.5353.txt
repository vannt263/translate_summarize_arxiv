    "semiconductor spintronics , which aims at incorporating the spin degree of freedom in electronics , has attracted much attention in the past decades.@xcite one of the main challenges in realizing spintronic devices lies in the control of spin lifetime .",

    "clear hot - electron effect is shown and the different field dependence of the srt compared to that in quantum wells is addressed . nevertheless , since most current electronic devices are performed in the high - field conditions , new features of the srt",
    "are expected when electrons are drifted to high valleys.@xcite the different spin - orbit couplings ( socs ) , momentum relaxations and effective masses in different valleys should have pronounced effects on spin dynamics . in fact , investigations on how the spin relaxation is affected by high electric field have been carried out in quantum well systems .",
    "the hot - electron effect@xcite and the multi - subband effect@xcite on spin dephasing in @xmath0-type gaas quantum wells have been studied .",

    "how the temperature and electron density dependences of the srt are affected by the high electric field is still unclear and the feasibility of the spin gunn effect predicted in bulk@xcite needs to be checked . because of the cubic form of the dresselhauss soc in the @xmath1 valley as well as the absence of quantum confinement in bulk , different behaviors in spin relaxation are expected .    in this work ,",

    "the electric field dependence of the srt is calculated and found to be monotonic , in contrast with the results in quantum wells.@xcite we attribute this to the strong enhancement of inhomogeneous broadening@xcite resulting from the cubic form of the @xmath1-valley dresselhaus soc in bulk .",
    "the electric field is also shown to effectively change the density and the temperature dependences of the srt .",
    "remarkably , a peak is predicted in the temperature dependence of the srt for relative low electron density under a moderate electric field .",

    "as for the @xmath2 valleys , we show that in contrast to the two - dimensional system where the @xmath2 valleys play the role of a `` drain '' of the total spin polarization , unexpectedly in bulk their effect on the total spin dynamics is weak and the total spin relaxation is mainly determined by the @xmath1 valley .",

    "however , in quantum wells with a small well width , the enhancement of scattering is more effective than that of the inhomogeneous broadening thanks to the linear form of the dresselhaus soc.@xcite besides , the effective magnetic field in the energy range of the @xmath1 valley overlapping with the @xmath2 valleys is still much smaller than that in the @xmath2 valleys .",

    "[ fig : t - t](a ) is also in the same trend as the high field cases .",
    "it is noted that in the discussion above , we focus on @xmath74 instead of @xmath107 .",
    "this is because , as discussed in the previous subsection , the total spin relaxation is mainly determined by the @xmath1 valley while most @xmath1-valley electrons stay in the lower - energy regime .",
    "meanwhile , according to the the discussions in sec .",
    "iiia , in the variation of the hot - electron temperature , the variation of inhomogeneous broadening is more profound than that of the momentum relaxation , thanks to the cubic @xmath108 dependence of the @xmath1-valley dresselhauss soc.@xcite therefore the variation of the inhomogeneous broadening mainly determines the variation of the srt .",
    "we point out that the different behaviors of hot - electron temperature with the lattice temperature at different electron densities and electric fields are originated from the temperature dependence of the energy - gain and loss rates of the electron system.@xcite with the increase of lattice temperature , the mobility is reduced resulting from the enhancement of scattering , so does the the energy - gain rate ; meanwhile the energy - loss rate decreases due to increase of phonon number.@xcite these two effects compete with each other and lead to the complex behavior of the hot - electron temperature in different conditions .",
    "a more detailed discussion is given in appendix  c.",
    "in summary , we have investigated the multivalley spin relaxation in @xmath0-type bulk gaas in the presence of high electric field by applying the fully microscopic ksbe approach .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 valleys , which are relevant in determining the properties of spin dynamics for the high electric field applied in this work , are taken into account .",
    "the effect of the @xmath2 valleys on spin relaxation is discussed and is shown to be very different from the quantum well system .",
    "we find that apart from the effect of directly manipulating the srt , the high electric field can also effectively modulate the density and temperature dependences of the srt .",
    "first , the srt is found to decrease monotonically with the electric field for electron densities from the nondegenerate to degenerate limit .",
    "this monotonic field dependence of the srt is very different from the previous works in @xmath0-type gaas quantum wells@xcite and is assigned to the pronounced enhancement of inhomogeneous broadening from the field - induced drift and hot - electron effects thanks to the cubic form of the @xmath1-valley dresselhauss soc in bulk .",
    "we show that , in despite of the very different strength of the soc in different valleys , the evolutions of spin polarizations in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 valleys share the _ same _ damping rate .",
    "this is demonstrated to come from the strong intervalley electron - phonon scattering and indicates the feasibility of exploring the properties of the hot electrons in the @xmath2 valleys through the phenomena detected in the @xmath1 valley .",
    "moreover , differing from the role of a `` spin drain '' of the total spin polarization in the two - dimensional system , we find that in bulk the @xmath2 valleys serve as a `` momentum damping area '' where electrons are blocked from drifting to higher momentum states due to the large effective mass .",
    "this tends to suppress the inhomogeneous broadening and in turn leads to a longer rather than shorter srt compared to the case without the @xmath2 valleys .    as for the density dependence of the srt , the formerly predicted@xcite and experimentally observed@xcite density peak in the field - free condition",
    "is recovered and is found to be shifted to higher density regime with higher electric field .",
    "we attribute this to the electric - field  induced hot - electron effect .",
    "we also investigate the temperature dependence of the srt in conditions with different electron densities and electric fields .",
    "the monotonic decrease of the srt with increasing lattice temperature in the field - free condition coincides with the previous works .",
    "nevertheless , the srt is found to decrease more slowly with higher electric field , and even turn to increase monotonically with increasing lattice temperature in the condition with low electron density and high electric field .",
    "more interestingly , a peak is predicted in the temperature dependence with low electron density and moderate electric field , which is vastly different from the formerly discussed one in high mobility samples in the field - free condition .",
    "we point out that this peculiar behavior of the srt originates from the temperature dependence of the energy - gain and loss rates of the electron system .",
    "finally , we remark on the feasibility of the spin gunn effect in @xmath0-type bulk gaas . for the preferred electron density in ref .",
    "( @xmath70  @xmath57 ) , we note that the srt is suppressed down to the value shorter than what required for the spontaneous spin amplification to appear under the electric fields where the charge gunn effect appears .",
    "this fast damping of spin polarization overtakes the spontaneously generation process and makes the spin gunn effect hardly to be realized in @xmath0-type bulk gaas system .",
