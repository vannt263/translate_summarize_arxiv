    "microfluidics and related nano / micro - technology have been active research fields for several years .",
    "numerous microflow devices such as microchannels @xcite , flow sensors @xcite , microvalves @xcite , micropumps @xcite,@xcite-@xcite , electrowetting @xcite , electro - hydrodynamics ( ehd ) @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite and magnetic - hydrodynamic @xcite have been reported . a droplet dispenser using the microfluidic chip format @xcite has recently found increasing popularity due to its potential for massively parallel array ability and scalability of its size @xcite .",
    "especially , the latter characteristic reduces the dead volume of the device , which is essential when dealing with an extremely small sample volume .",
    "the pulsed and discontinuous drug delivery systems are more advantageous in the academic and clinic applications , which can be used in therapeutics as concentrations of solutions vary with time , or matches body s release of peptides and hormones @xcite",
    ". the device would deliver drugs according to various stimuli such as chemical ph , electric fields , and temperature . by judging the degree of external signal , and",
    "the device would release appropriate amounts of drug @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the ehd based drug delivery system is applied mainly for three reasons .",
    "firstly , it does nt require complex fabrication because there is no moving part in the whole device .",
    "secondly , it can produce mono - disperse droplets in a wide range of sizes using either electrospray or single - droplet generation .",
    "thirdly , instability , poor directionality , and diversity in droplet size can be reduced by coating teflon on surface of pdms chip and reducing surface tension of liquid in fabrication process @xcite .",
    "our work shows that a stable , repeatable and controllable generation of volume at a constant rate has been achieved by the ehd method .",
    "many types of solutions can be delivered through the device such as di water , acetic acid , methanol , and so on .",
    "a typical ehd based micro drug delivery device is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] . an electric field would be formed after when we apply voltage on two electrodes .",
    "drug solutions would be under the electric pressure as soon as they arrive at the tip of the red nozzle . under the pressure ,",
    "the liquid is elongated and breaks up into single micro - droplets from the tip .",
    "taylor cone , which is very common in hydrodynamic spray processes , is suppressed by controlling the surface wetting property of the pdms device and the surface tension of the sample liquids .",
    "the core of the device made of pdms consists of a spherical drug reservoir and a cylindrical tube extruded from the reservoir , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "a metal tube / needle , as an anode , is inserted into the pdms core .",
    "electrode : silicon - based electrode coated with polyimide over an adhesion promoter .",
    "+ insulating material : diamond - like carbon ( dlc ) film adheres strongly to some plastics providing dlc is biocompatible .",
    "the big chunk of pdms in the middle is supposed to be made up by two half parts . for the reservoir",
    ", it is a half sphere , and for the micro - channel , it is a half cylinder .",
    "overall , the fabrication will be complicated .",
    "so we choose to use grey scale method on su-8 of e - beam lithography .",
    "teflon coated on the inner and outer surface of tip of the metal nozzle , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](d ) , can improve the stability and directionality of the droplet formation , and further reduce the droplet size by reducing surface tension of liquid .    fabrication process , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , consists of four steps as follows .",
    "( 1 ) put su-8 e - beam resist on top of silicon wafer . ( 2 )",
    "grey scale to overexpose the middle , and by manipulating the gradient density to get a perfect half cylinder and a half sphere . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3](b ) , 1 and 0.5 @xmath4 , is just a trial number .",
    "( 3 ) after overexposure , one half core is done",
    ". then cast pdms on top of it .",
    "( 4 ) coat metal nozzle with teflon .",
    "droplets generated by ehd method would carry a slight amount of charges . since nobody has really taken the droplet neutralization effect into account for a matured drug delivery system ,",
    "this part is hard to accomplish . here , we give out three possible solutions for this neutralization problem .",
    "a neutralization system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "when the charged droplet comes out of ce1 , by changing hv3 , we can actually change the negative electrons released from tip n , which are used to neutralize the positive charges carried on droplet @xcite .      by replacing the n part with a capillary of spraying volatile liquid out , which will bring negative electrons in the liquid ,",
    "when the evaporation is finished , electrons remain to neutralize the positive charges .",
    "electrons generated at the wall by proton losses are accelerated and decelerated by the beam potential and hit the opposite wall with a net energy gain , producing secondary electrons and forming a charged cloud .",
    "droplets are formed at the tip of nozzle , that is , the metal tube inserted into pdms channel .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] below shows the formation process of a droplet .",
    "now , assume the geometry of a liquid drop as a spherical cap .",
    "it is well known that the volume of a liquid droplet formed at the tip is given by @xmath5 where , @xmath6 is height of a droplet in the larger semisphere , @xmath7 , and a is radius of nozzle .",
    "then , define the spatial charge density , @xmath8 , in @xmath9 .",
    "the total charge of a liquid drop is @xmath10 in mems device , the gravitational effect on a droplet can be neglected . therefore , there are two groups of forces exerted on a forming droplet , electric force ( @xmath11 ) and surface force ( @xmath12 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .    electric force caused by the external electric field , due to coulomb s law ,",
    "is given by @xmath13 where , @xmath14 , and , @xmath15 is applied external voltage and @xmath16 is gap between tip of nozzle and ground eletrode",
    ".    surface force due to the surface tension between liquid , gas and nozzle , is given by @xmath17 where , contact angle , @xmath18 .",
    "a drug droplet is formed at the tip of nozzle , only when the electric force caused by ehd effect is larger than the surface force on the meniscus of droplet , @xmath19 .",
    "the droplet is elongated and breaks up from the nozzle at force equilibrium .",
    "the effective radius of a droplet can be calculated as follows . in equilibrium , @xmath20 , equating eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , volume of a droplet is @xmath21 and effective radius is @xmath22    so far , we have calculated the effective radius of a formed droplet in equilibrium at static state . based on our results , the drop size is dependent on nozzle size , drug solution properties ( surface tension ) , teflon coating ( contact angle ) , spatial charge density , distance between nozzle and ground electrode , and supplied voltage .",
    "two different time constants are of our interests .",

    "@xmath26,the required time to form a single droplet from the tip of nozzle , @xmath27 where , @xmath28 is fluid velocity profile created at the tip of nozzle .",
    "we will show how to calculate the velocity profile in the next section .      in order to estimate the flow rate inside the electrode induced by an external voltage , we use a well established model called electro - osmatic flow ( eof ) , which is the motion of liquid induced by an applied electric field across a charged micro - channel , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "several assumptions are made for the calculation of velocity profile at tip .",
    "( 1 ) two - dimensional fully developed flow . ( 2 )",
    "zero pressure gradient .",
    "( 3 ) slip velocity at channel wall is @xmath29 , where , @xmath30 is drug fluid permittivity , @xmath31 is drug fluid viscosity , and @xmath32 is surface electric potential @xcite .",
    "the governing equations used in our calculation are shown below ,    @xmath33    write the continuity and momentum equations in cartesian form ,    @xmath34    simplify the equations , we have @xmath35    using the assumption of zero pressure gradient , eq .",
    "( 10c ) vanishes and eq .",
    "( 10b ) can be simplified as : @xmath36    a general solution for eq .",
    "( 13 ) is in a form of @xmath37 here , @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be calculated , due to the boundary conditions , from    @xmath40    therefore , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the fluid velocity is given by @xmath43 it is a constant profile , independent of position along y - direction in the nozzle , as the yellow arrows shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7](b )",
    ".    it would be much easier to calculate the formation time as velocity is constant , since no integration is needed .",
    "now , substituting eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 15 ) into eq .",
    "( 8) , we can get the formation time of a droplet as @xmath44 eq .",
    "( 16 ) suggests the formation time of a droplet is a function of surface tension , viscosity , gap between electrodes , contact angle , nozzle size , applied voltage , permittivity , etc .",
    "here , nozzle size @xmath45 , applied voltage @xmath46 , gap @xmath47 .",
    "so , @xmath48",
    ". the liquid used in the simulation is water , the common solution to most drug solutions .",
    "its surface tension @xmath49 , and after teflon coating , the contact angle increases , @xmath50 .",

    "[ fig:10 ] .",
    "the ratio ranges from 4000:1 to 1:2 .",
    "neutralization works well when the ratio is around 200:1 , at which a formed droplet is neutralized completely .",
    "otherwise , the charges generated by ehd on droplet are either incompletely neutralized or changed to the opposite because of the higher charge density in neutralization region .",

    "properties of various solutions can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "formation time of a droplet , in eq .",

    "its properties are fixed .",
    "therefore , the factors to change the formation time are dimensions of the system .",
