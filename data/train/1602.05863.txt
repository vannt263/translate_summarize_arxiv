    "quantum correlations are at the heart of quantum information theory , constituting one of the key features that distinguishes quantum from classical composite systems .",
    "they are recognized as the essential resource that enables several quantum information processing schemes @xcite , such as quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum algorithms exhibiting an exponential speed - up over their classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "although quantum entanglement @xcite is the strongest type of quantum correlations , it does not encompass all non - classical correlations that can be exhibited by mixed states of composite systems .",
    "for such states , other measures of quantum - like correlations have been proposed @xcite , starting with quantum discord @xcite , which was then followed by other related measures @xcite .",
    "the presence of discord - like correlations has been shown to be important in various quantum information processes @xcite , including quantum state merging @xcite , quantum state discrimination @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite and quantum protocols @xcite . accordingly",
    ", several studies and verifications of these correlations in distinct contexts have been made @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a quantum resource theory based on quantum coherence has recently been developed @xcite and some quantifiers of this resource have been directly related to measures of quantum discord @xcite .",
    "quantum discord for a bipartite system can be defined @xcite as the minimum difference between two distinct quantum generalizations of the classical conditional von neumann entropy , one being the standard formal extension of the classical expression while the other one , introduced in @xcite , involves a local measurement on one of the constituents .",
    "the latter generalization measures the average conditional mixedness of the unmeasured component ( @xmath0 ) after the local measurement on the other component ( @xmath1 ) and is always a positive quantity , which is smaller or at least never larger than the original marginal entropy @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , its minimum over all local measurements at @xmath1 is exactly the entanglement of formation between @xmath0 and a third system @xmath3 purifying the whole system @xcite .",
    "this fundamental relation has enabled , in particular , the connection with quantum state merging , a quantum information task where in a pure tripartite system @xmath4 , @xmath0 transfers her state to @xmath3 through classical communication and shared entanglement . the minimal entanglement consumed in such process",
    "is given by the quantum discord between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( with measurements at @xmath1 ) .",
    "the measurement dependent conditional entropy has been recently extended to more general entropic forms @xcite , where a similar relation with the corresponding generalized entanglement of formation holds .",
    "in particular , this generalization allows the use of simple forms like the linear entropy , which can be more easily evaluated and enables a clean analytical solution of the associated optimization problem ( i.e. , that of selecting the local measurement which minimizes the conditional entropy ) in general qudit - qubit states @xcite .",
    "moreover , such entropy is directly related to the purity , an experimentally accessible quantity whose determination does not require a full state tomography @xcite , and which in the case of a qubit is formally related to the classical degree of polarization @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze and experimentally obtain the conditional purity , the quantum discord and other related measures of discord - like correlations @xcite in a particular class of mixed states which can be faithfully simulated through photonic quantum systems and linear optics @xcite .",
    "these states , which are mixtures of non - orthogonal aligned states , arise naturally in different contexts , in particular as reduced pair states in the exact ground state of spin @xmath5 chains with anisotropic @xmath6 or @xmath7 couplings , in the immediate vicinity of the factorizing magnetic field @xcite . in these chains",
    "they can also provide a basic description of reduced pair states in mean - field symmetry - breaking phases ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .    for such states , described in section [ iia ] , we first derive in [ iib][iic ] simple analytical expressions for the conditional reduced state and its purity after a local measurement on one of the qubits , including the average conditional purity and its maximum among all possible local projective measurements .",
    "we then derive in sec .",
    "[ iid ] a simple closed analytical expression for the quantum discord of these states in terms of the maximum conditional purity . note that the computation of the quantum discord for general states is difficult due the associated minimization",
    ", having recently been shown to be an np - complete problem @xcite .",
    "additionally , in [ iie ] we present expressions for the global post - measurement purity and its minimizing measurement , which allows to evaluate the associated information deficit and the geometric discord .",
    "these quantities are also analyzed and compared .",
    "we have then experimentally tested these theoretical results using polarization - encoded photonic qubits that arise from a source emitting a pair of photons in the same polarization state , which enables to reproduce the mixed two qubit states .",
    "a description of the experimental setup used to prepare the desired state and perform the local measurements is given at the beginning of section [ iiia ] , with [ iiib ] devoted to present the experimental results and their comparison with the theoretical predictions .",
    "conclusions are finally given in [ iv ] .",

    "any rank @xmath18 mixture of the form @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a general qubit state , can be rewritten at once in the form ( [ state ] ) by choosing a new @xmath13 axis in the bloch sphere halfway between the directions @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( and the @xmath23 axis in the plane determined by them ) . moreover , _ any _ mixture @xmath24 , where the angle between @xmath25 and @xmath26 is identical with that between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , can be also brought to the form ( [ state ] ) by applying local rotations on one of the qubits that shift @xmath26 to @xmath28 and @xmath25 to @xmath27 .",
    "these rotations will not affect correlation measures .",
    "mixed states of the form ( [ state ] ) can arise in different contexts .",
    "for instance , they emerge naturally as reduced two - spin states in the ground state of ferromagnetic - type spin @xmath5 arrays with anisotropic @xmath6 or @xmath7 couplings in the immediate vicinity of the transverse factorizing magnetic field @xcite , where the exact ground state becomes two - fold degenerate , being an arbitrary linear combination of uniform completely separable states , i.e. , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is determined by the coupling anisotropy @xcite ( assumed constant for all coupled pairs ) . the state ( [ gs ] ) leads to the reduced two - spin state ( [ state ] ) with @xmath31 , @xmath32 for _ any _ pair @xmath33 , after tracing out the remaining qubits and neglecting the complementary overlap @xmath34 , which decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath35 if @xmath36 . and in the mean field approximation , a reduced state of the form ( [ state ] ) with @xmath37 naturally arises in the whole parity breaking phase after parity symmetry restoration @xcite , becoming exact at the factorizing point .    the states ( [ state ] )",
    "can also be generated using a source emitting a pair of photons in the same polarization state , e.g.  by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) produced in nonlinear crystal cut for type i phase matching @xcite and linear optics , such that @xmath38 are linearly polarized states at angles @xmath39 with the vertical direction . here",

    "we have derived simple exact analytical expressions for the conditional purity of one of the qubits after a local measurement on the other qubit , including its maximum average .",
    "these quantities allow one to also determine quantum correlation measures .",
    "in particular , we have derived a simple exact analytical expression for the quantum discord of the state , which unveils its direct connection with the previous maximum average conditional purity , valid for the present states .",
    "this result enables a straightforward experimental evaluation of the quantum discord of the state through a conditional single photon purity measurement .",
    "such determination can assess , for instance , its potential for quantum protocols such as quantum state merging .",
    "the global post - measurement purity and the associated information deficit @xmath193 were as well analytically evaluated and compared with the previous measures .",
    "the experimental results showed a remarkable agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the analysis indicates that the form of the reduced state of the unmeasured photon @xmath0 remains unchanged after a remote measurement on photon @xmath1 , although selection of the measurement angle allows full control of the probabilities characterizing this reduced state , including pure and maximally mixed limits . at the same time , due to the non - orthogonality of the states involved these probabilities do affect the eigenstates of the conditional reduced states , and any local measurement does affect the average post - measurement global state .",
    "possible applications to cryptography and metrology are currently under investigation .",
