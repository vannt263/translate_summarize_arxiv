    "an adiabatic process , also referred to as an adiabatic passage , offers a simple and robust way to control a quantum system  @xcite .",
    "an adiabatic passage connects a stationary state of the initial system with another stationary state of the final system through a slow variation of an external field , for example .",
    "this has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically to a variety of microscopic systems , e.g. , atoms and molecules  @xcite .",
    "we here focus on the adiabatic passage along a closed cycle in the adiabatic parameter space .",
    "this corresponds to the case , for example , where the external field is applied only during a cycle , and is off before and after the cycle .",
    "one may expect that the adiabatic cycle induces no change , since there is no external field to keep the final state away from the initial one .",
    "this argument , however , has counterexamples .",
    "a famous one is the appearance of the geometric phase factor  @xcite , which is also referred to as the quantum holonomy  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an adiabatic cycle may deliver a stationary state into another stationary state .",
    "this can be regarded as an permutation of eigenspaces . since this is analogous with the quantum holonomy ,",
    "we call such an excitation due to adiabatic cycles an exotic quantum holonomy ( eqh ) . examples of eqh are reported through theoretical studies  @xcite .    in atomic and molecular systems , there are many studies of population transfers with the oscillating classical electromagnetic field both in theory and experiments . among them , stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( stirap )  @xcite employs an adiabatic cycle made of quasienergies , which is the counterpart of eigenenergy in periodically driven systems  @xcite .",
    "its adiabatic cycle passes through a crossing point of quasienergies to realize the adiabatic excitation ( or its inverse )  @xcite .",
    "hence , stirap can be considered as an example of eqh . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that , even in the absence of level crossings , periodically driven systems may exhibit eqh  @xcite .    in this manuscript , we offer another example of eqh .",
    "this example consists of a particle confined in one - dimensional region , where a slowly varying wall is applied to make cycles .",
    "we assume that the time - dependent wall is described by a potential , which is propotional to the @xmath0-function .",
    "we call it a @xmath0-wall .",
    "since our model is described by a slowly time - dependent hamiltonian , eqh is governed by the parametric dependence of eigenenergies , instead of quasienergies .",
    "this is in contrast with the examples with oscillating external field mentioned above .",
    "also , our model is far simpler than the known examples of eqh in hamiltonian systems , for example , a particle under the generalized pointlike potential  @xcite and a quantum graph with a @xmath1-vertex  @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations of our model may be feasible within the current state of art , as is suggested by the realization of optical box trap made of two thin walls  @xcite ,    we show that the adiabatic cycles of the present model may have qualitatively distinct result .",
    "namely , by adjusting the parameters of the adiabatic cycle ( i.e. , the initial and final positions of the @xmath0-wall ) , we may vary the final stationary state .",
    "also , by combining these cycles , we can connect an arbitrary adiabatic state . in this sense , these cycles form the basis of adiabatic excitations .",
    "in particular , we will examine two kinds of adiabatic cycles , which induces different permutations of eigenspaces .",
    "one is denoted as @xmath2 , which involves an insertion , a move , and a removal of the @xmath0-wall .",
    "although this resembles a simple thermodynamic process  @xcite , its consequence would have no similarity in thermodynamics .",
    "namely , we will show that the final state of the adiabatic cycle @xmath2 is different from the initial one , depending on the positions of the wall .",
    "in other words , @xmath2 may induce an excitation of the system .",
    "another example @xmath3 involves an insertion , a flip , and a removal of the wall .",
    "the eigenspace permutation induced by @xmath3 resembles the one found in the lieb - liniger model  @xcite , where all eigenspaces are excited at a time  @xcite .",
    "the plan of this manuscript is the following .",
    "we introduce our model in section  [ sec : model ] and provide an exact analysis of the application of the @xmath0-wall in section  [ sec : apply ] .",
    "the adiabatic cycles @xmath2 and @xmath3 are examined in sections  [ sec : cx ] and [ sec : cy ] , respectively .",
    "also in sections  [ sec : cx ] , we show that a combination of @xmath2 s adiabatically connects an arbitrary pair of eigenstates . section  [ sec : conclusion ] is dedicated to conclusion .",
    "in this section , we introduce a confined 1-d particle with a @xmath0-wall .",
    "suppose that a particle is confined within a one - dimensional region , whose position is denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "the particle is described by a hamiltonian @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the kinetic term and the confinement potential , respectively , and the particle mass is chosen to be unity .",
    "although the following argument is applicable to a wide class of confinement potentials @xmath7 as long as @xmath8 has several bound states and has no spectral degeneracy , it is convenient to employ an infinite square well to explain the concept .",
    "we assume @xmath9 for @xmath10 , and @xmath11 otherwise .",
    "as for the infinite square well , the eigenenergies of @xmath8 are @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the corresponding normalized stationary state .",
    "we introduce an additional @xmath0-wall , where the whole system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath15 we assume that we may vary the strength @xmath16 and position @xmath17 of the wall .",
    "let @xmath18 be an eigenenergy of @xmath19 for @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 where we impose @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we refer that an infinite square well with a @xmath0-wall was examined in refs .",
    "we examine the adiabatic insertion or removal of the @xmath0-wall , where the strength @xmath16 is varied while the position @xmath17 is fixed .",
    "the following analysis tells us how the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the unperturbed system ( i.e , @xmath24 ) are connected to the ones in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "first , we examine the `` exceptional '' case .",
    "suppose that the node of the eigenfunction @xmath26 coincides with the position of the @xmath0-wall , i.e. , @xmath27 which implies @xmath28 and @xmath29 for an arbitrary @xmath16 , as is shown in the following . since @xmath19 satisfies @xmath30 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : def_h ] ) , we obtain @xmath31 . for an arbitrary normalized state @xmath32",
    ", we find @xmath33 because of eq .  .",
    "hence we conclude @xmath34 , which implies @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we note that the condition eq .",
    "is equivalent to @xmath35 .",
    "since the analysis of exceptional levels are completed , we exclude them in the following .",
    "namely , we focus on the levels whose unperturbed eigenstates satisfy @xmath36 , which ensures that @xmath37 holds for an arbitrary @xmath16 .",
    "we show that there is no level crossing among these levels .",
    "let us examine a pair of the levels @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is assumed .",
    "we find from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eigen ] ) and  ( [ eq : hsplit ] ) , @xmath41 when @xmath42 holds , we obtain @xmath43 because of @xmath44 .",
    "namely , we find @xmath45 since @xmath46 monotonically increases with @xmath16 strictly , we conclude @xmath47 for an arbitrary @xmath20 .",
    "thus there is no level crossing between @xmath38-th and @xmath39-th levels .    a simple condition that ensures the absence of level crossing among the levels @xmath48 , where @xmath49 defines a cutoff , is @xmath36 holds for all @xmath48 . for the infinite square well",
    ", all unperturbed eigenstates satisfy this condition as long as @xmath50 is an irrational number .",
    "we examine an adiabatic cycle @xmath51 , which consists of an insertion , a move , and a removal of the @xmath0-wall . in particular , we impose that , during the second process , the @xmath0-wall is impermeable , i.e. , @xmath52 , to completely divide the confinement well into two regions .    the key to realize the adiabatic excitation through @xmath2 is to utilize the level crossing during the second process .",
    "the same concept has been utilized in refs .",
    "@xcite to realize the adiabatic excitations along cycles .",
    "although the level crossings are generally fragile against perturbations according to wigner and von neumann s theorem  @xcite , this theorem is inapplicable to our case since the system is completely divided into two parts . in reality , if we take into account the imperfection of the impermeable wall , e.g. the effect of tunneling , the spectral degeneracy may be lifted .",
    "there we need to resort to the diabatic evolution to go across the avoided crossing in order to approximately realize the adiabatic excitation  @xcite .",
    "we assume that the system is initially in a stationary state @xmath14 , i.e. , the @xmath38-th excited state of the initial system @xmath53 .",
    "we will show that the final state is the @xmath54-th excited state , if we appropriately choose @xmath55 and @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath51 delivers the initial stationary state to its higher neighboring state . for simplicity , we assume in this section that the confinement potential is the infinite square well , and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is irrational .    a precise definition of @xmath51 is shown .",
    "first , the wall is adiabatically inserted at @xmath55 .",
    "namely , the strength @xmath16 is adiabatically increased from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , while the position is kept fixed at @xmath61 .",
    "after the completion of this process , the @xmath0-wall is impermeable , i.e. , the confinement is divided into two regions .",
    "second , the impermeable wall is moved adiabatically from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) holds , we say that the left ( right ) well is expanded while the other well is compressed .",
    "third , the wall is adiabatically removed , where the strength @xmath16 is adiabatically decreased from @xmath60 to @xmath59 while the position is kept fixed at @xmath64 . after the completion of this process , the system is described by the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath8 again .    during the first process",
    ", the state vector of the system is @xmath65 , up to a phase factor .",
    "there is no level crossing @xmath66 , since we choose @xmath67 is irrational ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : apply ] ) .",
    "hence the system is always in @xmath38-th excited state .",
    "this implies that the system is also in the @xmath38-th state right before the second process .",
    "similarly , the system is in the @xmath54-th excited state right after the second process .",
    "we explain how the @xmath38-th and @xmath54-th states are connected by the second process , i.e. , the moving the impermeable wall from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , through a level crossing .",
    "we examine this process by introducing another quantum numbers @xmath68 and @xmath69 of the separated systems .",
    "since we assume that @xmath7 is the infinite square well , the system is divided into two infinite square wells during the second process .",
    "the left and right wells are placed at @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "we introduce two quantum numbers @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which describes the particle confined in the left and right wells , respectively , under the presence of the impermeable wall .",
    "the eigenenergies are @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we examine the level crossing consists of @xmath72-th and @xmath73-th states . by solving @xmath76",
    ", we find the degeneracy point @xmath77 since @xmath78 and @xmath79 monotonically depend on @xmath17 , @xmath80 holds if @xmath81 .    in the following ,",
    "we assume that there is no other level crossing that involves the eigenstates @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the second process @xmath82 .",
    "this condition is @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "now we determine the quantum number @xmath38 for @xmath72-th and @xmath73-th states at the initial point of the first process , where @xmath61 holds .",
    "let @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the values of @xmath38 for @xmath72-th and @xmath73-th states , respectively . from the condition for @xmath55 examined above",
    ", we find @xmath87 . in the left ( right )",
    "well , there are @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) stationary states below the @xmath72(@xmath73)-th stationary state .",
    "hence , we obtain @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "on the other hand , at the final point of the process ( 3 ) , i.e. , at @xmath64 , the order of the @xmath72-th and @xmath73-th states is reversed , i.e. , @xmath92 , which implies @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the conditions for @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be simplified if we specify the crossing point @xmath95 by its initial lower quantum number @xmath38 as @xmath96 and @xmath97 , for example , where @xmath98 is the maximum integer less than @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath38 is odd , we find @xmath99 on the other hand , when @xmath38 is even , we find @xmath100    we summarize the argument above to describe the adiabatic evolution along the cycle @xmath101 .",
    "the system is prepared to be @xmath14 initially .",
    "we utilize the crossing point @xmath95 at the second process , where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is assumed . during the first process ,",
    "the system is in @xmath104 up to the phase factor .",
    "hence the system is in @xmath38-th excited state . at the end of the first process",
    ", the state @xmath104 is @xmath73-th state in the right well .",
    "also , during the second process , the state keeps to stay in @xmath73-th state in the right well . at the same time , the systems is in @xmath54-th state of the whole system . during the third process ,",
    "the system is in @xmath105 up to the phase factor .",
    "hence , the final state of the cycle is @xmath106 . in this sense , the adiabatic excitation from @xmath14 to @xmath106 is completed .",
    "we depict the examples that adiabatically connects the ground and first excited states in figs .",
    "[ fig : n=1 ] and  [ fig : eigenfunction ] .",
    "we note that , from the construction , the repetition of the cycle @xmath101 two times , @xmath14 is delivered to the initial state @xmath14 , so is @xmath106 .",
    "hence the inverse of @xmath101 delivers @xmath106 to @xmath14 .",
    "we also note that an arbitrary pair of the eigenstates of @xmath8 can be adiabatically connected , if we appropriately combine adiabatic cycles @xmath51 with various values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "for example , the cycle shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n=1 ] connects two pairs @xmath107 and @xmath108 , whereas the cycle in fig .",
    "[ fig : other ] connects the pair @xmath109 .",
    "hence , the ground state @xmath110 can be connected to the stationary state @xmath111 by a combination of these two cycles . in this sense , these cycles can be regarded as basis of the adiabatic excitations .",
    "we proceed to examine the cycle @xmath112 that involves an insertion , a flip , and a removal of the @xmath0-wall placed at @xmath55 .",
    "we will show that @xmath112 delivers an arbitrary stationary state @xmath14 to higher neighboring state @xmath106 , if @xmath55 is chosen appropriately .",
    "hence the resultant permutation of eigenspaces is different from the one induced by @xmath113 .",
    "our definition of @xmath112 is the following .",
    "first , the strength of the @xmath0-wall @xmath16 is adiabatically increased from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , i.e. , the first process is the same with @xmath113 .",
    "second , @xmath16 is suddenly changed from @xmath60 to @xmath114 to flip the wall .",
    "third , @xmath16 is adiabatically increased from @xmath114 to @xmath59 to remove the wall .",
    "we note that @xmath112 resembles a cycle that passes tonks - girardeau and super - tonks - girardeau regimes of the lieb - liniger model  @xcite . in this cycle ,",
    "the strength of the two - body contact interaction of bose particles is varied from zero to @xmath60 , then is changed from @xmath60 to @xmath114 suddenly , and is finally increased from @xmath114 to zero .",
    "the adiabatic cycle excites the system consists of the bose particles  @xcite .",
    "we examine the parametric evolution of @xmath18 along @xmath112 ( see , fig .",
    "[ fig : cy ] ) .",
    "as is done in the previous section , we assume that the confinement potential is the infinite square well and @xmath67 is irrational .    the parametric evolution along the first process is examined in the previous section : @xmath18 monotonically increases with @xmath16 , and has no crossing with other levels .",
    "to examine the second process , i.e. the @xmath0-wall flip , we utilize the fact that an eigenenergy @xmath115 satisfies a transcendental equation , which is determined by the connection problem of the eigenfunction at @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "we may examine the transcendental equation with a small parameter @xmath116  @xcite , which concludes that the @xmath38-th eigenenergy is connected to the @xmath49-th eigenenergy at @xmath117 , i.e , @xmath118 where @xmath49 is an integer .",
    "the following proof of @xmath119 is divided into two parts .",
    "first , we show @xmath48 . since @xmath120 monotonically increases with @xmath16 ( see , sec .",
    "[ sec : apply ] ) , we obtain @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we find , from eq .  , @xmath123 , which implies @xmath124 .",
    "second , we show @xmath125 by contradiction . assuming @xmath126",
    ", we find @xmath127 holds from eq .  .",
    "using eq .  , we obtain @xmath128 , which contradicts with eq .",
    ". namely @xmath125 holds .",
    "thus we conclude @xmath119 .",
    "the analysis of the third process can be carried out as in the case for the first process .",
    "hence , we conclude that the eigenenergy monotonically increases from @xmath129 to @xmath130 during the third process .    in summary ,",
    "the adiabatic time evolution along @xmath112 is the following . during the first process",
    ", the state is @xmath65 up to a phase factor .",
    "the flip of the @xmath0-wall do not change the state . during the third process",
    ", the state is @xmath131 up to a phase factor , and finally arrives at the @xmath54-th stationary state of the unperturbed system .",
    "we remark on the inverse of @xmath112 . in general",
    ", @xmath132 adiabatically delivers an arbitrary stationary state , except the ground state , to the neighboring lower stationary state . on the other hand ,",
    "if the system is initially in the ground state , the corresponding eigenenergy diverges to @xmath114 as a result of the inverse cycle @xmath132 . the corresponding final state is strongly attracted to the @xmath0-wall with @xmath117 .",
    "we have shown that a confined one - dimensional particle are excited by the adiabatic cycles @xmath101 and @xmath112 , where the strength and the position of a @xmath0-wall is varied .",
    "hence we have obtained another simple example of exotic quantum holonomy  @xcite .",
    "we have shown a detailed analysis of the case that @xmath7 is the infinite square well .",
    "in particular , an appropriate combination of @xmath101 adiabatically connects an arbitrary pairs of the stationary states of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath8 . in this sense , the adiabatic cycles @xmath101 and @xmath112 can be regarded as basis of the permutations of eigenstates . as an extension of the present work , it may be interesting to find a combination of the cycles to realize an arbitrary permutation of eigenspaces  @xcite .    at the same time",
    ", we have shown the basis to extend the present result to the cases with an arbitrary confinement potential @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , an exact analysis of the adiabatic application of the @xmath0-wall is shown , where the condition for the absence of the level crossing during the insert / removal of the @xmath0-wall under an arbitrary confinement potential @xmath7 is clarified . hence , it is straightforward to show that the adiabatic excitation is possible for an arbitrary confinement potential , as long as the unperturbed hamiltonian has multiple bound states .",
    "the changes required to the present argument depends on the position of the nodes of the eigenfunctions of @xmath8 .",
    "the present scheme should be experimentally realized within the current state of art , e.g. , an optical box trap made of a one - dimensional confinement and two gaussian walls  @xcite .",
    "if an additional gaussian wall approximates a @xmath0-wall well , the adiabatic excitation by cycles can be realized .",
    "finally , we briefly explain a possible application of the present work to produce dark solitons with multiple nodes in a cold atom bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "this is based on the correspondence exploited in refs .",
    "@xcite , between higher excited states of a single particle system and dark solitons of the bec .",
    "more precisely , it is shown that a diabatic process , i.e. an adiabatic process with a diabatic jump through very narrow level crossing , delivers the ground state of a single particle system to its first excited state , and that we may produce a dark soliton with a single node using a straightforward extension of the diabatic process to the bec . because of the resemblance with diabatic process studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , the adiabatic cycles in the present paper may produce dark solitons from its many - body ground states , when applied to the dilute bose system .",
    "moreover , an appropriate combination of the adiabatic cycles will produce the dark solitons with multiple nodes , which correspond to a higher excited state in the single particle system .",
