    "recent observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies have confirmed several of the predictions of the simplest inflationary models @xcite .",
    "they have ( in combination with other datasets ) shown that the universe is close to spatially flat , with @xmath6 @xcite ; that the perturbations in the cmb are close to gaussian @xcite ; that the temperature and @xmath0-polarization power spectra match those expected from adiabatic initial conditions @xcite ; and that the perturbations are close to scale - invariant with @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thus there is now interest in testing the last of the major predictions of inflation : the existence of a roughly scale - invariant background of tensor ( gravitational wave ) perturbations .",
    "the amplitude of the tensor perturbations is typically described with the ratio of the temperature quadrupoles in the cmb @xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath10 depends on the specific inflationary model through the relation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the energy density at the time during inflation when observable scales in the cmb ( @xmath13mpc@xmath14 ) exited the horizon .",
    "a detection of the tensor perturbations would bolster confidence in inflation , as well as providing a measurement of @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath10 is large , then the tensor perturbations add to the @xmath15 temperature power spectrum of the cmb , and the nondetection of this feature in the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",
    "( _ wmap _ ) data sets an upper limit of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however the use of the temperature power spectrum to constrain @xmath10 suffers from the large cosmic variance error bars on the low cmb multipoles , which impose a fundamental limit on measurements of @xmath10 from @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , these measurements are model - dependent in the sense that modifications to the scalar power spectrum can produce excess power at @xmath15 without invoking tensors ( for example , @xmath10 is partially degenerate with the running of the spectral index @xmath18 in the current data @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative is to use the cmb polarization , which can be decomposed into @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes @xcite .",
    "since the scalar density fluctuations of multipole @xmath4 have parity @xmath19 , whereas the @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarization modes have parity @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively , it follows that the scalars can produce only @xmath0 polarization in linear perturbation theory .",
    "however tensor perturbations consist of both positive and negative parity modes for every value of @xmath21 , so the tensors can contribute to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath10 through @xmath1-mode polarization thus is not limited by the cosmic variance associated with the scalars , and is not degenerate with any features in the scalar power spectrum ; instead it is limited by the observations , foregrounds , and nonlinear processes that can create @xmath1-mode polarization from scalar initial conditions .",
    "the dominant nonlinear process that generates @xmath1-mode polarization in the cmb is gravitational lensing of the @xmath0 polarization generated during recombination .",
    "on the large angular scales relevant for tensor @xmath1-mode searches , the lensing @xmath1-mode appears as white noise with @xmath22 ; this would set a detectability limit of @xmath23 for a full - sky experiment if @xmath24 and @xmath25 if @xmath26 .",
    "( the optical depth to reionization @xmath27 is relevant since this determines the amplitude of large - scale polarization . )",
    "however , lensing results in higher - order correlations between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarization modes that allow one to `` clean '' out the lensing @xmath1-mode @xcite . the amount by which one can clean the @xmath1-mode using the iterative technique of ref .",
    "@xcite was computed by ref .",
    "@xcite as a function of the detector noise and beam size ; for the most sensitive experiment considered ( 0.25  @xmath28k  arcmin noise and 2  arcmin beam ) , the @xmath1-mode polarization can be cleaned down to @xmath29 , which reduces @xmath30 by a factor of 40 .",
    "the polarized foregrounds contain both galactic and extragalactic components .",
    "the extragalactic foregrounds such as point sources are approximately white noise and hence are largest on small angular scales , whereas the galactic synchrotron and dust emission are expected to have a significant polarization at low @xmath4",
    ". these can be at least partially cleaned using their frequency dependence , which differs from the blackbody signature expected from tensors .",
    "however it is also possible to generate polarization via thomson scattering of the cmb quadrupole by free electrons in the galaxy or other nearby structures .",
    "while this polarization signal is extremely small and is well below the predicted level of the synchrotron and/or dust foregrounds at all frequencies , it can not be cleaned using frequency information since it is a blackbody signal .",
    "it can contain both @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarization if the distribution of scattering electrons is anisotropic , hence it is a potential foreground for tensor @xmath1-mode searches .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to investigate this thomson polarization from the local universe .",
    "the polarization stokes parameters @xmath31 produced by thomson scattering are most easily determined in the line - of - sight formalism @xcite as @xmath32 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times { \\bf y}_{2m}^e({\\hat{\\bf n } } ) dr,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the temperature and polarization quadrupole moments of the cmb at position @xmath35 relative to the observer , and @xmath36 is the thomson visibility function , which depends on the optical depth @xmath37 to distance @xmath38 ; we have trivially generalized from ref .",

    "if @xmath47 were independent of @xmath39 , i.e. if the galactic optical depth were the same in all directions , then the only effect of the thomson scattering would be to ( i ) suppress the cmb power spectrum because of the factor of @xmath57 , and ( ii ) generate a small amount of @xmath58 @xmath0-mode through @xmath59 .",
    "however if @xmath47 is anisotropic with fluctuations @xmath60 , which is the case in the real galaxy we inhabit , then @xmath59 becomes a mixture of @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes that is generically of order @xmath27 times the cosmic temperature+polarization quadrupole . in the rest of this paper",

    "@xcite is @xmath64 .",
    "since this temperature quadrupole has already been measured , we can compute the induced polarization if we have a map of the galactic electron distribution . in this paper",
    "we compute the polarization @xmath59 using the model of cordes & lazio @xcite for the galactic distribution of free electrons .",
    "this model is based on pulsar dispersion ( dm ) and scattering ( sm ) measures as well as sms of other galactic and extragalactic radio sources , and is appropriate for the electron content of the galactic disk ; the predicted optical depth in the direction of the galactic poles is @xmath65 ( north ) or @xmath66 ( south ) .",
    "this is somewhat larger than the optical depth of @xmath67 predicted by the older taylor & cordes model @xcite .",
    "the input data to the cordes & lazio model is sparsely sampled , with a typical density of pulsars at high galactic latitude ( @xmath68  deg ) of @xmath69 , and small - scale structure in the electron density map is thus expected to be lost @xcite . as a crude estimate , we note that the number of modes per steradian is @xmath70 ; setting this equal to @xmath71 implies that structures smaller than @xmath72 should be lost .",
    "( the 14 non - pulsar sms at high galactic latitude do not significantly alter this conclusion . ) the effective @xmath73 at high galactic latitude may be even less than this because some of the pulsars lie within the thick disk and their lines of sight do not probe structure behind them .",
    "fortunately , this loss of resolution will not have a large influence on the results of this paper because we will find that the extragalactic contribution dominates the galactic thick disk for @xmath74 .",
    "the cordes & lazio model does not include the galactic corona component . indeed , very few constraints on the electron density in the corona are available , which is unfortunate because the corona may contain a significant fraction of the milky way s baryons @xcite .",
    "models of the milky way suggest a baryonic mass in the bulge and disk components of @xmath75 , whereas the virial mass is estimated at @xmath76 @xcite . for the currently favored baryon fraction",
    "@xmath77 @xcite , this suggests that an additional @xmath78 of `` missing '' baryons should either be present inside the milky way s virial radius or else must have been ejected .",
    "( indeed , ref .",
    "@xcite argued that at least half of the baryons are missing even though they assumed @xmath79 .",
    "increasing @xmath80 to 0.17 only makes the problem worse . ) assuming that a mass @xmath81 of baryons were ionized and are present in a shell at radius @xmath82 , they present a mean optical depth @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the helium abundance , @xmath85 is the proton mass , and we have neglected the distance from the earth to the center of the galaxy in comparison with @xmath82 . the virial radius for the milky way is estimated as @xmath86 @xcite , so that if a large fraction of the missing baryons are significantly inside the virial radius then the corona contribution to the optical depth could be comparable to the disk contribution .",
    "if instead the baryons are uniformly distributed in a ball , the radius and optical depth are related to the number density by @xmath87    one of the available constraints on the optical depth through the corona comes from the dispersion measures ( dms ) of pulsars observed in the large ( lmc ) and small ( smc ) magellanic clouds .",
    "the thomson optical depth and the dm along a line of sight are both proportional to @xmath88 , hence they are related by the equation @xmath89 dm where the dm is in units of @xmath90  pc . the observed dm in the magellanic cloud pulsars is greater than that predicted by the galactic thick disk model @xcite by 1691@xmath91  pc depending on the pulsar @xcite .",
    "however much of this excess dm may be internal to the magellanic clouds and not part of the galactic corona .",
    "cordes & lazio @xcite argue for this interpretation since the dms of pulsars not in the magellanic clouds are only fit if the electron density falls off beyond @xmath92 from the plane of the galaxy ( see their sec .",
    "this is also consistent with the factor of @xmath93 disparity among dm excesses in the lmc along lines of sight separated by only a few degrees . in any case",
    "the contribution of the galactic corona along the line of sight to the lmc at a distance of @xmath94 is limited to dm@xmath95  pc or @xmath96 . if this upper limit is typical of lines of sight to @xmath94 and we use eq .",
    "( [ eq : taubar ] ) with @xmath97 and @xmath98 as an upper limit on the optical depth beyond @xmath94 , we find that the optical depth through the milky way corona is at most @xmath99 .",

    "[ eq : rtnh ] ) for the corona and assigns a baryonic mass @xmath97 , the dm to the lmc provides an upper limit of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "this upper limit is significantly strengthened if the corona density is assumed to decrease outwards as a power - law more gradual than @xmath102 since this places the bulk of the baryons even farther away ( if the power law is steeper than @xmath103 the optical depth diverges at small @xmath38 , and would be cut off by either some core radius or our finite distance from the center of the galaxy ) .",
    "there are other constraints on the density of the galactic corona .",
    "if the infall velocities of high - velocity clouds are assumed to be less than their terminal velocity due to drag in the galactic corona , the density of the corona is limited to @xmath104 at @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "models of the kinematics @xcite and h@xmath106 emission @xcite from the magellanic stream argue for @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively at radius @xmath109@xmath110 ( but see criticism of these models arguing that survival of the stream then requires @xmath111 @xcite ) .",
    "interaction of high - velocity clouds with a galactic corona is also suggested in order to produce some of the o  vi detected in absorption @xcite .",
    "if the higher values of @xmath112 @xcite are correct , and the corona remains this dense out to radii @xmath113 , then it is possible that the optical depth through the halo may be @xmath114 .    in order to assess the @xmath1-modes produced in the corona , we must remember that it is the _ fluctuations _ in optical depth @xmath115 , rather than the mean optical depth @xmath116 , that produces @xmath1-modes .",
    "we will return to this point in the discussion , and for now we focus on the smooth cordes & lazio model @xcite for the known population of galactic electrons .",

    "this indicates that the nearby universe is more inhomogeneous than average , which is not entirely surprising since we live in an overdense region of the universe and it is these regions that contribute most of the small - scale power .    since the mathis _",

    "@xcite simulations provide an actual optical depth map , it is possible to construct an actual realization for the combined thomson scattering signal from the milky way s disk and from nearby extragalactic structures .",
    "we have computed the power spectrum @xmath146 of this realization with the quadratic estimator , and added to it the `` missing '' power from @xmath225  mpc ; the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : extra](b ) .",
    "this is our final result for the frequency - independent , thomson - induced @xmath1-mode power spectrum from the galactic disk and nearby extragalactic structures ( but excluding the corona ) .",
    "the contribution is roughly @xmath226@xmath3k per logarithmic interval in @xmath4 , which is well below the cleaned lensing signal even for an optimistic experiment",
    ".    we can be more quantitative about the effect on the estimation of the tensor signal @xmath10 by using the tensor signal @xmath227 as a template in the quadratic estimator instead of the band powers . in this case",
    "we can get the spurious contribution to @xmath10 from the equation @xmath228 , where @xmath229 and @xmath230 are computed using eq .",
    "( [ eq : quadest ] ) with @xmath231 .",
    "the map @xmath136 to be inserted into the equation for @xmath229 is the sum of the known galactic disk and extragalactic ( @xmath232mpc ) signals and the unknown extragalactic signal from @xmath225mpc , which we denote @xmath233 and @xmath234 respectively .",
    "we can put into the estimator the actual value of @xmath233 , whereas we must account for @xmath234 statistically using its covariance matrix @xmath235 : @xmath236.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation yields @xmath237 for the template with optical depth @xmath24 , and @xmath238 for @xmath26 .",
    "this is negligible , since even for the optimistic ( 0.25@xmath239arcmin noise , 2  arcmin beam ) experiment , the fisher matrix uncertainties in @xmath10 are @xmath240 and @xmath241 for @xmath24 and @xmath242 respectively .",
    "we have considered the contribution to the cmb @xmath1-mode polarization from thomson scattering in the local universe , which is a potential contaminant to the gravitational wave signal .",
    "our findings are that :      the thomson scattering signal from the galactic disk and from nearby extragalactic structures is well below the weak lensing @xmath1-modes even after the lensing signal is `` cleaned '' out using a lensing reconstruction from a very optimistic experiment .",
    "this signal is believed to be negligible .    the galactic disk also thomson - scatters the foreground radiation emitted by the milky way .",
    "at the low multipoles , this radiation can exceed the cleaned lensing signal ; in the k band it is roughly equal to the uncleaned lensing signal at @xmath58@xmath243 .",
    "however this signal is strongly frequency - dependent , and in principle can be removed by the same techniques used to clean other galactic foregrounds .",
    "thomson scattering within the hot galactic corona makes an unknown contribution to the @xmath1-modes , depending on the flucutations in the optical depth through the corona .",
    "the contribution can be roughly estimated based on eq .",
    "( [ eq : bb ] ) : @xmath244 this can exceed the cleaned lensing signal if the large angular scale fluctuations in the optical depth through the corona are @xmath245 . since a mean optical depth through the corona of up to @xmath246 appears to be reasonable , and there are only very limited constraints on the angular distribution of free electrons in the corona , fluctuations of @xmath245 can not yet be ruled out .    of these , the scattering from the galactic corona is of the most interest . in principle ,",
    "detection of this signal would provide evidence that the corona contains some of the missing baryons ; non - detection of the @xmath1-mode signal would provide an upper limit on the anisotropy of the corona .",
    "however the practical difficulties should not be understated : reaching the `` cleaned lensing '' limit of @xmath247 requires a detector sensitivity of @xmath248arcmin , two orders of magnitude better than the upcoming _ planck _ satellite .",
    "it is also possible that the frequency structure of the polarized foregrounds is sufficiently complicated that extraction of small large - angle @xmath1-mode signals becomes impractical .",
    "finally it is possible that tensor perturbations , or some other source of frequency - independent @xmath1-modes such as cosmic strings , are present and swamp the galactic thomson scattering signal .    from the perspective of cmb gravitational wave searches , the galactic thomson scattering signal appears to be negligible for all except the most futuristic experiments .",
    "part of the reason for this is the low value of the local quadrupole @xmath249 , which is only @xmath250 of the @xmath153cdm expected value ; if @xmath153cdm is indeed correct , we are in this respect simply lucky . for the very futuristic experiments , however , if a frequency - independent @xmath1-mode signal were observed close to the detectability threshold , then the interpretation as a gravitational wave source would require that thomson scattering in the local universe be robustly ruled out as the source .",
    "this would require significant improvement in our understanding of the galactic corona .",
