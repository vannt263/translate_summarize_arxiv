    "nakamura number _ plays a critical role in the study of preference aggregation rules with _",
    "acyclic _ social preferences .",
    "consider a _ simple game _ ( voting game ) @xmath14 , a collection of `` winning '' coalitions in a set  @xmath15 of players .",

    "@xmath17 , for which one can define the social preference  @xmath18 ( dominance relation ) and the _ core _",
    "@xmath19 ( the set of maximal alternatives with respect to @xmath18 ) .",
    "nakamura s theorem ( @xcite ) gives a restriction on the number of alternatives that the set of players can deal with rationally ( theorem  [ nakamura - thm ] ) : the core of a simple game with preferences is always ( i.e. , for all profiles of acyclic preferences ) nonempty if and only if the number of alternatives is finite and below a certain number , called the _ nakamura number _ of the simple game .",
    "the theorem thus gives a condition ( corollary  [ nakamura - cor ] ) for the social preferences to inherit acyclicity from individual preferences .    to deal with an empty core ( or cycles in social preferences )",
    ", several authors have investigated solutions different from the core .",
    "we pick two examples for which there have been recent developments .",
    "first , @xcite proposes a procedure in which one deletes particular instances of preferences until the resulting subrelation is acyclic ( alternatively , transitive or negatively transitive ) , and collects the maximal elements of all such ( maximal acyclic ) subrelations .",
    "second , taking voters foresight into consideration , @xcite proposes the _ stability set _ , a superset of the core .",
    "all these investigations focus on treating cyclic _ social _ preferences , assuming that _ individual _ preferences satisfy a rationality property at least as strong as acyclicity .      in this paper , we propose a _ preference aggregation theory without acyclicity_. in contrast to the authors cited in the preceding paragraph , we do not attempt to remove cycles in ( social and even individual ) preferences .    we retain the usual framework ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* section ii.2 ) in which a set @xmath1 of underlying alternatives is distinguished from an _ agenda _ ( opportunity set ) @xmath20 with which a group  @xmath15 of players are confronted .",
    "in particular , fixing a simple game  @xmath14 and a set @xmath1 , we focus on the aggregation methods that assign the core @xmath21 or the _ core without majority dissatisfaction _ @xmath22 ( introduced later ) . ] to each @xmath23 satisfying a certain assumption .",
    "the assumption , which is actually a condition concerning a pair @xmath24 , is that _ every player s preference @xmath25 has a maximal element in  @xmath26 _ : the _ maximal set _ @xmath27 ( the set of maximal elements of the preference ) is nonempty for each  @xmath28 .. when @xmath1 is infinite , there is an acyclic preference that has no maximal element on  @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , the property of having a maximal element on  @xmath26 is independent of the property of having a maximal element on  @xmath1 . ] this is a rather direct assumption at the individual level , which is to be inherited to the requirement at the social level that there is a chosen alternative for the given pair .",
    "the assumption is distinctive in that it involves an agenda  @xmath26 as well as a profile  @xmath29 .",
    "for this reason , it does not fit the following _ standard scenario _ in social choice theory @xcite very well : before knowing an agenda , the players discover and report their own preferences ( on  @xmath1 ) to the planner ; having obtained a choice rule that assigns a nonempty subset to every agenda , the planner applies the rule to a particular agenda  @xmath26 . since the planner does not generally know whether a pair @xmath24 satisfies the assumption until she faces the agenda  @xmath26 , what she obtains immediately after learning the profile  @xmath29 of preferences is only a _ partial _ choice rule , which might assign an empty set to some agenda .",
    "an _ alternative scenario _ that the assumption fits well is the following : the planner first presents an agenda  @xmath26 to the players , who then discover and report their own preferences ( for alternatives in  @xmath26 at least ) to the planner ; the planner then makes a choice .",
    "this is perhaps a closer description of actual collective decisions .",
    "while failing to produce a choice rule at an intermediate stage , the scenario has some advantages over the standard scenario .",
    "first , the alternative scenario can deal with context - dependent choices based on multiple _ rationales _ ( preferences belonging to the same individual ) more easily , where the context is given by an agenda @xcite .",
    "the problem with the standard scenario is that a player is supposed to report a single preference for the whole set  @xmath1 , when she might actually have an irreducible set of multiple rationales .",
    "second , as @xcite writes , `` ideally , one could observe all preferences among the available alternatives , but there would be no way to observe preferences among alternatives not feasible for society , '' even if each player has a single preference .",
    "this argument justifies the alternative scenario either directly or via _ arrow s iia _ ( independence of irrelevant alternatives ) , which requires that social choice from an agenda depends only on the individual preferences restricted to the agenda .",
    "both the core and the core without majority dissatisfaction satisfy arrow s iia . for all @xmath28 , we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the assertion for @xmath32 is a corollary of lemma  [ c+maximal ] .",
    "the reader should not confuse arrow s iia with the iia ( sometimes called _ property  @xmath33 _ ) for choice rules , discussed by @xcite , for example . ] or on  @xmath26 .",
    "if a preference were defined on an agenda , however , a more straightforward formulation would be to remove the symbol  @xmath26 from the framework and call that agenda  @xmath1 .",
    "doing so , however , would make the connection between the alternative scenario and the framework much less clear .",
    "for this reason , we _ formally _ define preferences on  @xmath1 instead of on  @xmath26 . ]",
    "the _ core without majority dissatisfaction _",
    "( definition  [ c+ ] ) is obtained by deleting from an agenda all the alternatives that are non - maximal for all _ individual _ players in a large ( winning ) coalition .",
    "it is ( lemma  [ c+in_c ] ) a strengthening or subset of the _ core _ , obtained by deleting from the agenda all the alternatives that are non - maximal for a large ( winning ) coalition of players _",
    "collectively_. consequently , it only chooses pareto efficient alternatives from an agenda , unlike other solutions such as the stability set @xcite .",
    "the core without majority dissatisfaction is a simple solution concept that treats the maximal sets @xmath34 of the players in a better - behaved way than the core does .",
    "( it is reasonable to pay attention to such sets , since they are the very objects that we assume to be nonempty . ) first , unlike the core , the core without majority dissatisfaction depends only on the players maximal sets ( lemma  [ c+maximal ] ) .",
    "second , each alternative in the core without majority dissatisfaction belongs to someone s maximal set ( lemma  [ c+in_maximals ] ) .",
    "the same is not true for the core ( examples  [ ex : core1 ] and [ ex : core2 ] ) .",
    "the main results of the paper are similar to nakamura s theorem ( @xcite ) , except that they consider _",
    "profiles for _ an agenda  @xmath26profiles of ( not necessarily acyclic ) preferences that have maximal elements on the agenda .",
    "_ the first main result _ , theorem  [ nakamura - max ] , is about the original nakamura number for simple games @xmath14 defined on an algebra of coalitions .",
    "it asserts that the following statements are equivalent : ( i )  the number of alternatives in the agenda  @xmath26 is less than the nakamura number  @xmath35 ; ( ii )  the core @xmath22 without majority dissatisfaction is nonempty for all profiles @xmath29 for the agenda ; ( iii )  the core @xmath21 is nonempty for all profiles @xmath29 for the agenda .",
    "regardless of which choice rule is used , the nakamura number therefore measures the extent ( the size of an agenda ) to which simple games will assuredly choose some alternative from the agenda , whether individual preferences are assumed to be acyclic or to have maximal elements .",
    "theorem  [ nakamura - max ] is remarkable for the following reasons : first , it demonstrates that one can obtain a significant result without assuming acyclic preferences .",
    "though neglected in the literature , a preference aggregation theory without acyclicity has potential .",
    "second , the _ general _ nonemptyness of the core implies the _ general _ nonemptyness of the _ strengthening _ of the core .",
    "the core without majority dissatisfaction is as satisfactory as the core according to this criterion .",
    "third , restricting preferences to those with maximal elements allows us to drop the awkward condition that the agenda is finite .",
    "unlike theorem  [ nakamura - thm ] , theorem  [ nakamura - max ] gives a condition for the general nonemptyness of the core for _ infinite _ , as well as finite , agenda .",
    "fourth , it fits the alternative scenario .",
    "it gives a condition for the planner to be assured of the existence of a chosen alternative as soon as she presents an agenda to the players ( i.e. , before she learns their preferences , supposing that they have maximal elements ) .",
    "fifth , our framework is very general .",
    "like @xcite , we impose no conditions such as monotonicity or properness on simple games .",
    "unlike @xcite , we consider arbitrary sets of players and _ arbitrary algebras _ of coalitions .    _",
    "the second main result _",
    ", theorem  [ nakamura - max - extended ] , is about the _ kappa number _ ( definition  [ kappa ] ) , an extension of the nakamura number to the even more general framework that distinguishes the collection  @xmath36 of the sets of players for which one can assign winning / losing status from the algebra @xmath37 of ( identifiable ) coalitions . the kappa number @xmath38 is defined for a collection @xmath39 of winning sets .",
    "the result asserts that the following two statements are equivalent : ( i )  the number of alternatives in the agenda  @xmath26 is less than the kappa number  @xmath38 ; ( ii )  the core @xmath40 without majority dissatisfaction is nonempty for all profiles @xmath29 for the agenda .",
    "it also asserts that the above two statements imply , but are not implied by : ( iii )  the core @xmath41 is nonempty for all profiles @xmath29 for the agenda .",
    "theorem  [ nakamura - max - extended ] gives another sense in which the core without majority dissatisfaction behaves better than the core .",
    "computing the kappa number is not an easy task in general .",
    "so , in applying the theorem , lemma  [ nu - kappa - nu ] is useful ; it estimates the kappa number from above and below in terms of the nakamura numbers .",
