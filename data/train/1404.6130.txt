    "the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation raised a number of deep questions regarding the phase of the condensate and its operational meaning , its interference properties and other quantum concepts @xcite .",
    "interference fringes are observed when two _ independently _ prepared bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are released and overlap @xcite . at first sight , this phenomenon seems to be in contrast with commonly accepted wisdom on the young - type double - slit interference ( first - order interference ) experiments from independent sources : since the relative phase between the two wave functions is not constant ( this is what is meant by  independent \" sources ) , no interference can be observed .",
    "notice however that the second - order ( two - particle ) interference can be observed in a hanbury - brown and twiss type experiment @xcite , where the quantum interference between the amplitudes corresponding to the two paths from the independent sources to the detectors is observed @xcite .",
    "questions on the interference and the phase of the condensate have attracted the attention of many researchers .",
    "this motivated a very interesting debate on the most fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics and the features of many - body quantum systems .",
    "javanainen and yoo @xcite proposed that the phase of the condensate is established by measurement : an interference pattern is certainly observed in each _ single _ experimental run , but the patterns shift from run to run , so that no interference persists if all the observed interference patterns are superimposed , with no contradiction with the common wisdom on the first - order interference .",
    "the conclusion that the phenomenon can be ascribed to  measurement - induced interference \" was also corroborated by related studies by cirac _",

    "@xcite , and by castin and dalibard @xcite .",
    "the main ideas are also explained in review papers @xcite and even in textbooks @xcite , to signify the fundamental importance of the problem and its correct interpretation .",
    "these results are also interesting for the outlook they yield on symmetry breaking phenomena @xcite , and it is proposed that the fluctuations in the interference patterns can be exploited to probe interesting characteristics of many - body systems @xcite .    in this article , we would like to contribute to these issues .",
    "we will show that two - particle interference is _ typical _ , in the sense that most wave functions , randomly sampled out of a suitable subspace in the hilbert space that describes the bose - einstein condensate , display interference .",
    "no matter how the two gases are prepared , or no matter how the splitting process of the atomic gas into two parts takes place , one will typically observe an interference pattern in each experimental run .",
    "in quantum mechanics one computes expectation values of observables .",
    "the textbook interpretation is statistical : an observable is represented by a self - adjoint operator and its expectation value over a state yields the average that one obtains by repeating the same experiment many times ( with the system prepared in the same state ) .    in the case to be examined here , one faces a difficulty : we are required to discuss a `` single - shot '' experiment . when two independently prepared condensates are released and overlap , the two clouds will always interfere , in each experimental run , but the offset of the interference pattern will change randomly from run to run . on average ( over many experimental runs ) interference is smeared out .",
    "the salient feature of each individual run is the very presence of a clear interference pattern , with its characteristics ( e.g. , the distance between adjacent maxima ) .",
    "can one extract this single - run behavior from the quantum mechanical formalism ?    in this article",
    "we will argue that interference is robust with respect to the state preparation .",
    "the main idea is the following .",
    "each time two condensates are experimentally prepared ( out of a single condensate , e.g.  by inserting a `` wall '' between them @xcite ) , their wave function is sampled out of a given set .",
    "this set is a portion of the total hilbert space and presumably depends on experimental procedures and details ( state preparation ) .",
    "we have no access to this information .",
    "we will therefore analyze the _ typical _ features of such a wave function , namely those features that characterize its behavior and properties in the overwhelming majority of cases .",
    "we will see that interference is one of these distinctive features . even though the offset ( positions of the maxima and minima ) of the interference pattern is random , so that interference will vanish on average over many repetitions of the experimental run , the very _ presence _ of an interference pattern will emerge as a typical feature of the wave function .    clearly , no prediction is possible , in the quantum mechanical formalism , if an expectation value is not computed .",
    "one must always sandwich an operator between a bra and a ket at the end of one s calculation .",
    "the only exception to this very general rule is for a nonfluctuating observable , that is when the system is in an eigenstate of the observable .",
    "in such a case the results of single - shot experiments do not change from run to run .",
    "we will show that asymptotically , i.e.  for large number of particles , the constitutive features of the interference pattern ( period , intensity of the peaks , and so on ) do not depend on the fact that a quantum expectation value is computed , nor on the details of the preparation of the state .",
    "before we embark in the technical details of the calculation , we anticipate that no hypothesis of decoherence between the two independent condensates will prove necessary .",
    "the two condensates will always be described by a randomly sampled pure state .",
    "in a typical experiment of bec interferometry , a condensate made up of @xmath0 bosons is distributed among two orthogonal modes , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "if the modes are spatially separated at the initial time , they are eventually let expand , overlap , and ( possibly ) interfere .",
    "we assume that the total number of bosons @xmath0 is fixed in the experiment .",
    "a useful basis for a system of @xmath0 bosons is given by two - mode fock states @xmath3 in which the two modes , labelled with @xmath4 and @xmath5 , have well - defined occupation numbers .",
    "( we assume that @xmath0 is even for simplicity . ) in the second - quantization formalism , fock states are obtained by applying a sequence of creation operators to the vacuum state @xmath6 : @xmath7 due to the orthonormality of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the mode operators @xmath8 satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath9",
    "=   [ \\hat{b } , \\hat{b}^{\\dagger } ] = 1,\\ ] ] and all the operators of mode @xmath4 commute with those of mode @xmath5 . here",

    "we assume that , in each experimental run , the initial state of the two - mode system is randomly picked from the subspace spanned by the fock states @xmath14 with @xmath15 , assuming that @xmath16 is odd .",
    "the case @xmath17 represents the setup studied previously @xcite , while we are interested here in the large @xmath16 case .",
    "we will have in mind the case @xmath18 , but we will work in full generality , with arbitrary @xmath16 , and show that the following results are robust against larger scalings of @xmath16 .",
    "( the case @xmath19 coincides with uniform sampling over the full hilbert space . )",
    "the assumption of _ uniform _ sampling is a simplifying one : the number of states that are actually involved in the description and their amplitude will depend on the experimental procedure and the way the two bec clouds are created @xcite .",
    "if the pure state @xmath20 of the system is expanded in the fock basis ( [ fock ] ) , @xmath21 the only states with nonvanishing probability will be the ones with @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath23 the coefficients @xmath24 are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution on the surface of the @xmath25-dimensional unit sphere @xmath26 . due to this assumption of uniform sampling ,",
    "the average square modulus of the coefficients , @xmath27 , is the inverse of the subspace dimension , while the average of the coefficients themselves , as well as all the quantities that depend on relative phases in the superposition vanish : @xmath28 where we shall denote with a bar the statistical average over the distribution of the coefficients of the state .",
    "notice that this quantity yields the density matrix associated with the uniform ensemble of @xmath20 : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the projection onto the subspace @xmath31 .",
    "the statistical average of the expectation value @xmath32 of observable @xmath33 over the ensemble of states @xmath20 is @xmath34 its statistical variance , which measures the fluctuations of the expectation value @xmath35 among the states @xmath20 of the ensemble , reads @xmath36 and involves a quartic average [ see @xcite , eq .",
    "( 53 ) ] @xmath37 the quartic average is relevant also in the statistical average of the variance of observable @xmath33 in state @xmath20 , @xmath38 which measures the average quantum fluctuations .",
    "indeed , @xmath39 is the expectation value of the observable @xmath40 .",
    "notice that by adding the two uncertainties @xmath41 and @xmath42 one gets @xmath43 which is nothing but the quantum variance of observable @xmath33 at the mixed state @xmath44 .",
    "if one samples the initial state from a degenerate distribution with @xmath17 , in which only the fock state with equal number of particles in the two modes has nonvanishing probability , the contribution to such a variance will come only from the quantum fluctuations @xmath45 at @xmath46 , while , obviously , @xmath47 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the ensemble is made up of eigenstates of the observable @xmath33 , then the quantum fluctuations vanish , @xmath48 , and the only contribution comes from the statistical fluctuations @xmath41",
    ".    in general , there will be an interplay in ( [ fluctgen ] ) , which will depend on @xmath16 , between the two sources of fluctuations .",
    "an observed property is typical if @xmath49 , and is run - independent if @xmath50 .",
    "our goal is to show that the period of the interference pattern can be viewed and analyzed in a similar fashion .",
    "since we are interested in the quantities that are related to interference , we will focus on those observables associated with the spatial distribution of particles and their fourier transforms @xcite . in this section",
    "we will introduce the relevant averages in the general case , postponing quantitative considerations on interference to the following section . in the second - quantization formalism , the spatial density observable",
    "is given by the operator @xmath51 while its fourier transform reads @xmath52(\\bm{k } ) = \\int d\\bm{r } \\ , e^{-i \\bm{k } \\cdot \\bm{r } } \\hat{\\rho}(\\bm{r}).\\ ] ] expanding the field operators and taking the expectation value ( [ expgen ] ) , one finds that the average density @xmath53 is merely the sum of the particle densities in the two modes , with no interference between them .",
    "clearly , this property holds also for the fourier transform .",
    "this result apparently contrasts with experiment , as interference is observed even if no phase coherence between the particles in the two modes is present .",
    "however , as we will show in the following , the average ( [ exprho ] ) can not give sufficient information on the result of a _ single _ experimental run , since its fluctuations can be very large .",
    "on the other hand , we will show that the outcome of a single run can be inferred , within a controlled degree of approximation , from the study of a different operator , namely @xcite @xmath54 the normal ordering of the field operators in the first integral incorporates the symmetry @xmath55 .",
    "notice that the expectation value of the number of particles @xmath56 is a constant for all states @xmath20 and is thus immaterial in our study . under specific assumptions on the values of @xmath0 and @xmath16 in ( [ 6 ] )",

    "let us also observe that , due to the form ( [ oprk ] ) of @xmath58 , all the off - diagonal contributions involve products of the type @xmath79(-\\bm{k})\\mathcal{f}[\\psi_a^*\\psi_b](\\bm{k})$ ] or @xmath79(-\\bm{k})\\tilde{\\rho}_{a , b}(\\bm{k})$ ] . in the cases we will study below these terms will vanish due to the symmetric structure of the modes , and thus @xmath80 will be the only relevant contribution to the covariance .",
    "moreover , the structure of the higher order contributions in  ( [ covoff ] ) is the same and therefore the last term will also vanish .",
    "this feature relaxes the condition for the vanishing relative covariance of @xmath77 : it vanishes in the limit @xmath81 , irrespectively of @xmath16 .",
    "another important quantity in the analysis of interference patterns is the statistical average of the quantum covariance of the observable @xmath82 around its expectation value @xmath83 after normal - ordering the field operators , the operator appearing in the first term of ( [ deltar2 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath84 the result for its averaged expectation value reads @xmath85 where the sums @xmath86 read @xmath87 while @xmath88 are symmetric functions of their arguments , whose form is given in the appendix .",
    "in the following section , we will analyze the two cases in which the distribution of @xmath77 displays the sharp peaks that provide the information on the interference pattern in each experimental run , with fluctuations being negligible in proper ranges of @xmath0 and @xmath16 .",
    "in this section , we will discuss a paradigmatic example of interference in bose systems @xcite , to show how and under which physical conditions interference becomes typical . let us assume that the system be confined in a unit volume , with periodic boundary conditions , and let us choose as orthogonal modes two counterpropagating plane waves @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "the building blocks of the average value of @xmath77 in ( [ rho2kfinal ] ) and its covariance ( [ rho4k ] ) are the fourier series of the densities and the products @xmath91 . in this case , the form ( [ planewaves ] ) of the wave functions yields the fourier coefficients @xmath92(\\bm{k } ) = \\delta_{\\bm{k},-2\\bm{k}_0 } , \\quad \\mathcal{f } [ \\psi_b^*\\psi_a](\\bm{k } ) = \\delta_{\\bm{k},+2\\bm{k}_0},\\ ] ] which make all terms of the form @xmath93(\\pm\\bm{k})$ ] and @xmath94(-\\bm{k})\\mathcal{f } [ \\psi_a^*\\psi_b](\\bm{k})$ ] in the covariances identically vanish ( see the appendix ) .",
    "the average value ( [ rho2kfinal ] ) of the squared fourier component of the density reads @xmath95 as we shall see , this quantity is essential to characterize the interference pattern appearing in a single experimental run .",
    "however , it is first necessary to compute its covariance in order to estimate its fluctuations .",
    "both @xmath96 and the terms of @xmath97 in @xmath80 identically vanish .",
    "thus , for large @xmath16 , the dominant contribution to @xmath98 comes from the @xmath99 terms in the diagonal part , otherwise the covariance is @xmath100 : @xmath101    the use of ( [ planewavesft ] ) largely simplifies the functions @xmath102 that appear in the statistical average of the quantum covariance [ see ( [ deltarho ] ) ] , that finally reads @xmath103 important comments must be made on the results ( [ rho2kpw])([rho4kpw ] ) .",
    "first , the order of magnitude of the covariance is smaller than the order @xmath104 of the squared average value @xmath105 , unless @xmath106 .",
    "this implies that if @xmath107 ( i.e. , @xmath108 for @xmath81 ) fluctuations around the average of @xmath109 in ( [ rho2kpw ] ) are negligible , and the distribution of its values is peaked around its most probable value .",
    "therefore , we can identify two different regimes : for @xmath110 , the relative fluctuations @xmath111 scale as @xmath112 and are of the same order as the quantum fluctuations of the central fock state ; for larger values of @xmath16 , say @xmath113 with @xmath114 , but still @xmath115 ( i.e.  @xmath116 ) , the fluctuations scale as @xmath117 .",
    "notice also that in the latter regime the order of magnitude of fluctuations is the same as the subleading terms in ( [ rho2kpw ] ) , and that terms @xmath118 and @xmath119 are subdominant in all regimes .",
    "if fluctuations on the peaks appearing in the average value @xmath57 are small , we expect that in each run , for any initial state sampled from our distribution , as long as @xmath120 , the outcome of the measurement of this quantity , which is obtained by fourier - transforming the experimental density , will read , with overwhelming probability , @xmath121.\\ ] ] this result , together with the normalization and condition of reality of the density , determines the form of the fourier transform of the density @xmath122,\\ ] ] which finally yields the single - run interference pattern @xmath123 note that this perfect visibility is guaranteed by the condition @xmath120 in ( [ eqn : averplane ] ) .",
    "the phase offset @xmath124 is fixed in each experimental run , but must fluctuate from run to run : the density is indeed uniform on average @xmath125 the randomness of the phase offset accounts for the fact that , unlike @xmath126 , fluctuations around the average value of @xmath127 are very large .      in this subsection we will analyze a more realistic model , describing a physical situation that is closer to experimental implementation .",
    "the cold atoms are initially trapped in two gaussian clouds by an external potential .",
    "the distance between the centers of the distributions is larger than their widths , so that the initial wave packets do not appreciably overlap .",
    "the trap is then released and the clouds expand in free space until they overlap and interfere .",
    "we will explicitly consider the time evolution of the system in one spatial dimension , for simplicity : if the scattering between the particles in the condensates is neglected , the time dependence can be evaluated by observing that the correlation functions at time @xmath128 can be obtained by replacing the initial modes @xmath129 with their time - evolved ones @xmath130 to simplify notation , lengths will be expressed in units of the gaussian mode width @xmath131 and times in units @xmath132 .",

    "the search for a quantum mechanical explanation of statistical mechanics dates back to the founding fathers of quantum theory  @xcite . in the last few years",
    "this subject has been revived and several successful new results have been obtained . for a review , see @xcite . in refs.@xcite a justification for the applicability of the canonical ensemble was given that does not rely on subjective additional randomness added by hand , or on ensemble averages .",
    "the statistical behavior is shown to be a direct consequence of a genuine quantum approach .",
    "in particular , in refs .  @xcite it was shown that , under general assumptions on the hamiltonian , typically random pure states of large quantum systems locally look as the microcanonical state .",
    "these works are based on typicality arguments and on the mathematical phenomenon of measure concentration @xcite .",
    "typicality has also been shown to be important in many emerging phenomena in physics and other sciences .",
    "an interesting application is e.g.   on the structure of entanglement and of local entropies in large quantum systems  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we have shown that typicality arguments also apply to one of the most basic quantum phenomena : interference .",
    "two parts of a bose - einstein condensate , that are first separated and then let overlap , will ( almost ) always interfere , no matter what their wave function looks like , even if the splitting process divides the condensate in two unbalanced parts .",
    "no decoherence mechanism has been invoked .",
    "different regimes have been identified , as a function of the scaling of @xmath16 with @xmath0 .",
    "the threshold is at number fluctuations as large as @xmath161 with @xmath162 , which for @xmath163 atoms yields @xmath164 atoms .",
    "interference remains observable even for such an uneven splitting process .",
    "one of the objectives of our future research will be to analyze some recent experiments performed in vienna @xcite that bring to light other interesting aspects of the interference of becs , and in particular the onset to decoherence , viewed as the randomization of the relative phase as a function of the time elapsed after the splitting process .      in this appendix",
