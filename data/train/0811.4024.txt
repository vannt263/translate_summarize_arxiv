    "a seismic event launches at least two types of _ surface waves _ , one causing vertical ( elliptic ) movements , the other causing rather destructive lateral ( shear horizontal ) movements . in the essay which won him the adams prize in 1911 ,",
    "love @xcite proposed a simple earth model which supports the latter kind of waves , by considering a crust made of an isotropic , linear , elastic solid , rigidly bonded onto a substrate ( a semi - infinite solid ) made of another isotropic , linear , elastic solid . in this heterogeneous structure ,",
    "a shear horizontal wave may propagate , leaving the upper face of the layer free of traction , and having an amplitude which decays rapidly with depth in the substrate .",
    "this localisation of the amplitude variation is what makes love waves ( and surface waves in general ) a subject of great interest in seismology , because it means that the energy spreads essentially in two dimensions , and thus the wave travels further from the epicentre than bulk waves , for which the energy spreads in three dimensions .    over the years",
    ", love s results were extended in several directions and turned out to be also useful in other contexts .",
    "for instance anisotropy ( e.g. @xcite ) , inhomogeneity ( e.g. @xcite ) , piezoelectric coupling ( e.g. @xcite ) , and many other effects were considered see the review by maugin @xcite for an exhaustive account .",
    "two possibilities are of special interest to seismology science : the possibility of including _ strain - induced anisotropy _ , because it provides a simple and revealing modelling of the consequence of slow tectonic movements , and the possibility of including _ non - linear effects _ , because large amplitude seismic movements have indeed been observed .",
    "the first possibility can be dealt with within the framework of small - amplitude waves superimposed upon a large static homogeneous pre - strain , see hayes and rivlin @xcite , willson @xcite , kar and pal @xcite , or dowaikh @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is usually treated in the framework of the so - called weakly non - linear elasticity theory ( see maugin @xcite or norris @xcite for instance ) , where the equations of motion are developed one order further than the linear regime ( note that according to zabolotskaya @xcite , non - linear shear horizontal waves require fourth - order elasticity . )    here we propose to combine both effects , by considering finite - amplitude love waves in a finitely deformed layer / substrate structure .",
    "our only restriction is in our choice of a constitutive law for the solids , as we focus on the so - called _ compressible neo - hookean materials_. these enjoy a peculiar property once deformed @xcite : they allow the propagation of a finite - amplitude , inhomogeneous , linearly polarized , transverse plane wave in any direction .",
    "moreover , this wave is obtained by solving a linear ordinary differential equation even though the theory is completely non - linear ( in passing we note that the eventuality of a solitary wave is thereby precluded here ) .",
    "we use this wave as an ingredient in the construction of the love wave solution to the corresponding boundary value problem . a great deal of generality",
    "is nonetheless achieved , in particular because _ non - principal _ wave propagation is possible , and because the solution is _ exact _ , without any limitations to be imposed on its magnitude .",
    "corresponding general results are obtained on energy propagation in the layer and the substrate .    a special case of the ` compressible neo - hookean ' model was first introduced to describe a class of solid polyurethane rubbers studied in the blatz - ko experiments @xcite .",
    "of course we remain aware that solids playing a role in the applications of love waves are not always adequately described by the ` compressible neo - hookean ' strain energy density . however exact and expilicit results like those of this paper are always useful , either as a basis for perturbation methods or for testing numerical schemes .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ section2 ]",
    ", we present the constitutive equations of the compressible neo - hookean model .",
    "next ( section [ section3 ] ) , we retrieve results for transverse inhomogeneous time - harmonic waves superimposed on a pre - stressed state @xcite but also present similar results for transverse unattenuated time - harmonic motion . in section [ section4 ] ,",
    "the set - up consisting of a semi - infinite substrate covered with a layer of finite thickness is described and the effect of pre - strain is investigated , assuming that the two solids are rigidly bonded . a large amplitude love wave solution is then obtained provided the propagation direction in the interface and the normal to the interface are along conjugate directions of the pre - strain tensors .",
    "a dispersion equation is also obtained , similar to that of linear isotropic elasticity .",
    "here however this equation involves the bulk wave speeds along the propagation direction and along the normal to the layer , which are both affected by the pre - deformations . in section [ section6 ] ,",
    "we derive the energy densities and energy fluxes corresponding to the motions in the layer and in the substrate .",
    "mean energy densities and fluxes are obtained by averaging over a period in time , and their properties are investigated .",
    "total energy densities and fluxes are also introduced , showing that the repartition of energy between the layer and the substrate depends on the ratio of layer thickness to the wavelength .",
    "finally ( section [ section7 ] ) , we consider the special case when the interface is in a principal plane of the pre - strain tensors in the layer and the substrate . in this case",
    "the propagation direction may be any direction in the interface and , owing to the anisotropy induced by the pre - stress , the love wave speed varies with the propagation direction .",
    "in order to deal with possibly large deformations of solids , we invoke the finite elasticity theory .",
    "to model the non - linear elasticity of solids , we use one of the simplest constitutive models on offer for compressible isotropic solids , which may be called the ` compressible neo - hookean material ' .",
    "we here present this model .",
    "let @xmath0 be the _ deformation gradient _ , defined as usual ( see , for instance , @xcite ) by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the position of a particle in the reference ( lagrangian ) configuration and @xmath3 the corresponding position in the current ( eulerian ) configuration .",
    "associated with @xmath0 is the the left cauchy - green strain tensor @xmath4 where the superscript @xmath5 denotes the transpose .",
    "the determinant of @xmath0 is @xmath6 it is the ratio between the volume of a material element of the solid in the reference and current states .",
    "_ compressible neo - hookean materials _ are characterized by a strain - energy density @xmath7 , measured per unit volume in the undeformed state , given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant ( the _ shear modulus _ ) and @xmath10 is an _ arbitrary _ function of @xmath11 ( a material function , which can be adjusted to model the compressibility properties of the solid ) .",
    "the corresponding constitutive equation for the symmetric cauchy stress tensor @xmath12 is @xmath13 such a ` compressible neo - hookean ' material is sometimes called ` special blatz - ko ' material , or ` restricted hadamard ' material @xcite .",
    "hayes @xcite shows that the resulting equations of motion are strongly elliptic when @xmath14 and we assume as much henceforth .",
    "we also assume that the undeformed state is stress free , so that @xmath15 .",
    "note that comparison with linearised isotropic elasticity yields @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath9 are the lam coefficients .",
    "here however , no restriction is placed on the amplitude of the displacement @xmath18 , so that due to , and the arbitrariness of @xmath10 , the relation between @xmath12 and @xmath19 is clearly non - linear .",
    "several examples of specific volumetric functions @xmath10 have been presented over the years ( see , for instance , baar and weichert @xcite ) . among these",
    ", we recall the particularly simple choice of levinson and burgess @xcite , leading to a model called ` simplified blatz - ko ' in @xcite , that is @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 in order to satisfy .",
    "here we consider transverse wave solutions in unbounded pre - strained materials .",
    "suppose that a compressible neo - hookean material is first subjected to a static finite homogeneous deformation defined by @xmath23 where the @xmath24 are constants .",
    "the corresponding constant left cauchy - green strain tensor is @xmath25 and the determinant @xmath26 is a constant . on this state of deformation , we superpose a time - dependent displacement taking a particle from position @xmath3 to position @xmath27 where @xmath19 is the mechanical displacement . in the absence of body forces , the equations of motion for this time - dependent deformation may be written in the form @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the constant mass density in the intermediate state of static deformation , and @xmath30 is the piola - kirchhoff stress tensor at time @xmath31 with respect to the intermediate state of static deformation , @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the cauchy stress tensor at time @xmath31 , and @xmath34 is the deformation gradient with respect to the intermediate state of static deformation . we note that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the deformation gradient with respect to the undeformed configuration .    as in @xcite , we are now looking for solutions with a displacement field @xmath37 of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are functions to be determined , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are unit vectors .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not parallel and that @xmath43 is orthogonal to both @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath44 so that ( [ eq:3.3 ] ) represents a linearly polarized transverse wave with propagation speed @xmath45 .",
    "for such a wave motion , recall that @xmath46 and its inverse are @xcite @xmath47 so that the special blatz - ko constitutive equation ( [ eq : blatzko ] ) yields @xmath48 and , because @xmath49 , the piola - kirchhoff stress tensor reduces here to @xmath50    it follows @xcite that the displacement field ( [ eq:3.3 ] ) is a solution of the equations of motion if and only if @xmath39 and @xmath40 satisfy the equation @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 denote the derivatives of @xmath39 and @xmath40 with respect to their argument .",
    "we then choose @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that @xcite @xmath54 which means that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are along the principal axes fo the elliptical section of the ellipsoid @xmath55 by the plane @xmath56 .",
    "then , ( [ eq:3.19 ] ) yields two uncoupled equations for @xmath39 and @xmath40  : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an arbitrary constant , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the wave speeds of homogeneous bulk waves propagating along @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , @xmath61    if @xmath58 is assumed to be _ positive _ , @xmath62 ( say ) for some real @xmath63 , then ( [ eqfg ] ) yields an _ unattenuated time - harmonic wave motion _ provided @xmath64 .",
    "the displacement field of this wave is @xmath65\\\\ \\times \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{\\sqrt{v^2-v^{2}_{{\\boldsymbol{n } } } } } ( { \\boldsymbol{n } } \\cdot { \\boldsymbol{x}}-vt)\\right){\\boldsymbol{a}},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 are arbitrary constants .",
    "if @xmath58 is assumed to be _ negative _ , @xmath68 ( say ) for some real @xmath69 , then ( [ eqfg ] ) yields an _ inhomogeneous time - harmonic wave motion _ provided @xmath70 .",
    "the displacement field of this inhomogeneous plane wave is @xmath71 where @xmath69 , @xmath72 are arbitrary constants .",
    "here we retrieve a solution obtained in @xcite .",
    "however the solution was not mentionned in these papers because the emphasis there was on inhomogeneous plane waves . here , both and are needed for the construction of a love wave solution .",
    "we remark that when the condition ( [ nbm ] ) is not satisfied , solutions may nevertheless be obtained @xcite ; however either @xmath39 or @xmath40 is then of real exponential type and hence no time - harmonic wave motion is possible . in this paper",
    "we focus on time - harmonic waves because they are the building blocks for love waves .    for future reference",
    ", we conclude this section with the evaluation of the traction vector @xmath73 on a plane @xmath74 .",
    "because the displacement @xmath19 is along @xmath43 and hence orthogonal to @xmath41 , such a plane is globally preserved in the motion .",
    "moreover , @xmath49 and @xmath75 by ( [ fhat ] ) . hence ,",
    "using nanson s formula , @xmath76 , linking an areal element @xmath77 in the current configuration with the same areal element @xmath78 in the intermediate state , we conclude that when @xmath78 is along @xmath41 , then the areal element is the same in both configurations : @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the traction vector @xmath73 on a plane @xmath80 is the same whether it is measured per unit area of the intermediate state or per unit area of the current state . recalling ( [ nbm ] ) , we obtain @xmath81 where @xmath12 denotes the constant cauchy stress tensor of the intermediate state .",
    "we wish to extend the classical results of love @xcite in the linear elasticity theory in two directions : by taking account of initial stresses ( and the accompanying strain - induced anisotropy ) , and by allowing the wave s amplitude to be arbitrarily large .",
    "we start with love s original set - up , which consists of a semi - infinite substrate , covered with a layer of finite thickness . the two solids are bonded rigidly . here",
    "we assume that both the substrate and the layer are made of different ` compressible neo - hookean materials ' , with a shear modulus @xmath9 and a function @xmath82 for the substrate and a shear modulus @xmath83 and a function @xmath84 for the layer .",
    "also , @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the mass densities of the substrate and the layer , respectively , measured in the undeformed reference configuration .    in order to model geological formations ,",
    "it is common to consider that the solids have been subjected to initial stresses , giving rise to strain - induced anisotropy ( see for instance the works of biot @xcite or tolstoy @xcite ) . to simplify matters here , we focus on static _ homogeneous initial strains_. thus , if @xmath2 denotes the position of a material particle in the undeformed solids , with origin @xmath87 in the interface between the substrate and the layer , then the initial deformations are @xmath88 here , the components of the deformation gradients @xmath0 in the substrate , and @xmath89 in the layer , are constants .",
    "the associated constant left cauchy - green strain tensors are @xmath25 in the substrate and @xmath90 in the layer . also , we let @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "we call @xmath41 the unit vector normal to the faces of the layer , in the static pre - strained state ( [ eq : xfx ] ) , oriented from the layer toward the substrate , see fig.[fig_sketch ] . hence , in this pre - strained state",
    ", the layer / substrate _ interface _ is the plane @xmath93 , or equivalently , @xmath94 , and the substrate occupies the @xmath95 half - space . also , in the static pre - strained state",
    ", the _ upper face _ of the layer , in contact with vacuum , is the plane @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the thickness of the layer in this state , so that the layer occupies the @xmath98 region .    as in the classical linear case",
    ", we focus on the possible existence of a linearly - polarized transverse wave , propagating in a direction @xmath42 and polarized in a transverse direction @xmath43 , both parallel to the interface .",
    "thus , ( @xmath99 ) forms an orthonormal triad .    to ensure rigid bonding the displacement must be continuous at the interface .",
    "the displacements @xmath19 in the substrate and @xmath100 in the layer are given respectively by @xmath101 at any point in the interface @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 for some @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "then the displacement continuity @xmath106 at the interface is equivalent to @xmath107 . because this must hold for all @xmath104 , @xmath105",
    ", we conclude that the requirement of _ displacement continuity _ is @xmath108",
    "it then follows that @xmath109 .",
    "hence , using the identity @xcite : @xmath110 , and similarly for @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath111 from which it follows that @xmath112 we note in passing that the unit vector @xmath113 normal to the faces of the layer in the undeformed state is given by @xmath114 and that the thickness @xmath115 of the layer in the undeformed state is @xmath116    next , we consider the corresponding constant cauchy stress tensors @xmath12 and @xmath117 , in the substrate and the layer , respectively .",
    "the equilibrium of the pre - strained state requires that the upper face of the layer be subjected to the traction ( deadload ) @xmath118 , and that the traction vector be continuous at the interface , @xmath119 . using the constitutive equations of the layer and of the substrate , this yields @xmath120    using the requirements of continuity of the displacement and of the traction at the interface ,",
    "we now show how a given initial strain @xmath121 in the layer ( resulting from a prescribed stress @xmath117 ) determines the initial strain @xmath122 in the substrate .",
    "first , we note that ( [ bcstress])@xmath123 may alternatively be written as follows , using ( [ eq : mbm ] ) , @xmath124 because @xmath121 is given , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are known and so , this is an equation for a single unknown , @xmath11 .",
    "it is shown in the appendix how the strong ellipticity assumption implies that this equation has at most one positive solution for @xmath11 , and one and only one solution if , in addition , it is assumed that @xmath127 . once @xmath11 is known , then ( [ eq : mbm ] ) determines @xmath128 , and ( [ bcstress])@xmath129 determine @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath132    in order to obtain all the components of @xmath122 in the orthonormal triad ( @xmath99 ) , we still need to determine @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 . for this purpose , we note that the displacement continuity requirement ( [ bcdispl ] ) implies that @xmath136 using @xmath137 in ( [ eq : nb-1n])@xmath138 , and the identity @xmath139 ,        \\label{eq : id2}\\ ] ] valid also with @xmath121 instead of @xmath122 , we obtain @xmath140 recalling ( [ eq : expl1])@xmath141 , we obtain @xmath142 a similar procedure , using @xmath143 in ( [ eq : nb-1n])@xmath144 , yields @xmath145 finally , ( [ eq : nb-1n])@xmath123 with @xmath137 and @xmath143 yields @xmath146    to summarize : when the ( constant ) left cauchy - green strain tensor @xmath121 in the layer is prescribed , then the ( constant ) left cauchy - green strain tensor @xmath122 in the substrate is uniquely determined .",
    "first , @xmath11 is uniquely determined from equation ( [ eq : detj ] ) .",
    "then , all the components of @xmath122 in the orthonormal triad ( @xmath147 ) are explicitly given by equations ( [ eq : expl1])@xmath148 , ( [ eq : aba ] ) , ( [ eq : nbn ] ) , ( [ eq : nba ] ) .    in order to use the exact wave solutions described in section [ section3 ] , we shall assume from now on that the condition ( [ nbm ] ) is fulfilled in the layer , which , by ( [ eq : expl1])@xmath149 implies that it is also fulfilled in the substrate  : @xmath150 then , the equations for the other components of @xmath122 reduce to @xmath151 in tensorial form , the expression of @xmath122 in terms of @xmath121 is given by @xmath152 \\\\",

    "now we look at wave propagation in the initially deformed structure . in the substrate",
    ", we require that amplitude of the wave decays in the direction of @xmath41 , and hence the displacement field @xmath19 is assumed to be of the form ( [ att ] ) . in the layer",
    ", we consider an unattenuated time - harmonic displacement field @xmath100 of the form ( [ unatt ] ) . as in the classical case",
    ", we wish to combine these exact wave solutions in order to obtain a global time - harmonic wave motion with propagation speed @xmath45 .",
    "note that both displacement fields need to be of the same angular frequency , and hence the same wavenumber , in order to satisfy boundary conditions at the interface .",
    "thus , using ( [ att ] ) for the substrate and ( [ unatt ] ) for the layer , we write @xmath154 and @xmath155          \\cos k({\\boldsymbol{n } } \\cdot { \\boldsymbol{x } } -v t ) { \\boldsymbol{a}},\\ ] ] where @xmath156 is the _ wavenumber_. here , in accordance with ( [ homogv ] ) , the body waves speeds @xmath60 , @xmath59 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 are given by @xmath159 and the love wave speed @xmath45 has to satisfy @xmath160 notice that this is possible only when @xmath161 , or equivalently , recalling @xmath162 , when @xmath163 .",
    "thus , love waves require the combination of a ` slow ' ( or ` soft ' ) layer over a ` fast ' ( or ` hard ' ) substrate , independently of the initial pre - strain .",
    "we now show that the boundary conditions may be satisfied .",
    "this leads to the dispersion equation ( a relation between @xmath164 and @xmath45 ) and the determination of the constants @xmath72 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 in terms of a single parameter characterizing the amplitude of the wave .",
    "the first boundary condition to enforce is that the displacement is continuous at the layer / substrate interface @xmath93 . using and",
    ", this gives @xmath165    the second boundary condition is the continuity of the traction vector at the layer / substrate interface @xmath166 . using ( [ eq : traction ] ) , and applying it to the wave motion , we obtain , for the traction @xmath73 on a plane @xmath74 in the substrate , @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the mass density of the substrate in the intermediate configuration . similarly for the traction @xmath169 on a plane @xmath74 in the layer ,",

    "we take both the layer and the substrate to be of the levinson and burgess type - , with @xmath257 and @xmath258 , an assumption often encountered in the geophysics literature ( it leads to an infinitesimal poisson ratio of @xmath259 , which is common for rocks ) . hence , @xmath260 and @xmath261 and equation yields @xmath262 for the ratios @xmath263 and @xmath264 , we take the values , @xmath265    for the principal stretches in the layer we take @xmath266 so that @xmath267 , which means a change in volume of 14% .",
    "the corresponding stress tensor in the layer is @xmath268 so that the deformation can be maintained with the constant normal pressure @xmath269 ( deadload ) applied at the upper face of the layer .",
    "it then follows from and that @xmath270 and @xmath271    as explained in section [ section5 ] , the dispersion curves can be deduced from dispersion curves in the linear isotropic case , and are shown in fig.[dispersioncurves ] .",
    "clearly , because @xmath157 varies with the chosen direction @xmath42 , this figure shows that the number of possible modes for a given value of the dispersion parameter @xmath272 is not necessarily the same for all @xmath42 .",
    "we here focus on the influence of pre - strain and choose , for instance , @xmath273 ( wavelength equal to twice the thickness layer ) , a value of this parameter such that two modes of propagation are possible in all directions @xmath42  : a _ fundamental mode _ with speed @xmath274 , and a _ second mode _ with speed @xmath275 . in fig.[polargraph ] , we plot the polar graphs of @xmath60 , @xmath157 , and of the love wave speeds @xmath274 and @xmath275 of the two modes as a function of the angle @xmath276 between the propagation direction @xmath42 and the principal direction @xmath277 , corresponding to the greatest stretch @xmath278 . we note that the greatest and least values of @xmath274 and @xmath275 correspond to propagation along the directions of greatest and least stretch in the interface , indicating an experimental way of determining these directions .",
    "in this paper , we have obtained an exact finite - amplitude love wave solution for a layer and a subtrate consisting of pre - strained compressible neo - hookean materials .",
    "the dispersion relation is similar to that of linear isotropic elasticity , but an explicit dependence on the pre - strain is exhibited . in particular , the number of wave modes for different values of the dispersion parameter @xmath272 ( @xmath164 : wave number , @xmath97 : thickness of the deformed layer ) is influenced by the pre - strain .",
    "it should be emphasized that the existence of this love wave solution is subjected to the condition that the propagation direction @xmath42 and the normal @xmath41 to the interface are such that @xmath279 , where @xmath122 and @xmath121 are the left cauchy - green strain tensors characterizing the pre - strain of the subtrate and of the layer , respectively .",
    "note that it follows from the continuity of the traction at the interface that the conditions @xmath280 and @xmath281 are equivalent .",
    "thus , the interface may be arbitrarily chosen .",
    "however , when it is not a principal plane of @xmath122 and @xmath121 , there is only one propagation direction satisfying these conditions .",
    "in contrast , when the interface is a principal plane of @xmath122 and @xmath121 , all propagation directions @xmath42 in this interface are possible . in this case , for a given value of @xmath272 , the number of possible modes is not necessarily the same for all propagation directions .    the energy flux and energy density of the solution in the layer and in the substrate have been studied in detail . in particular , it has been shown that the mean energy fluxes in the layer and in the substrate are both along @xmath282 , thus along the same direction , parallel to the interface .",
    "the fact that this direction is not along the propagation direction ( except when @xmath42 is a principal direction ) is due to the anisotropy induced by the pre - strain .",
