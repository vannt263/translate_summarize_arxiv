    "newton  puiseux theorem states that , for an algebraically closed field @xmath0 of zero characteristic , given a polynomial @xmath1[y]$ ] there exist a positive integer @xmath2 and a factorization @xmath3 where each @xmath4[y]$ ] .",
    "these roots @xmath5 are called the _ puiseux expansions _ of @xmath6 .",
    "the theorem was first proved by newton @xcite with the use of newton polygon .",
    "later , puiseux @xcite gave an analytic proof .",
    "it is usually stated as : _ the field of fractional power series , i.e. the field @xmath7 , is algebraically closed _",
    "abhyankar @xcite presents another proof of this result , the `` shreedharacharya s proof of newton s theorem '' .",
    "this proof is not constructive as it stands .",
    "indeed it assumes decidable equality on the ring @xmath8 $ ] of power series over a field , but given two arbitrary power series we can not decide whether they are equal in _ finite _ number of steps .",
    "we explain in this paper how to modify his argument by adding a separability assumption to provide a constructive proof of the result : the field of fractional power series is _ separably _ algebraically closed .",
    "in particular , the termination of newton  puiseux algorithm is justified constructively in this case .",
    "this termination is justified by a non constructive reasoning in most references @xcite , with the exception of @xcite ( for an introduction to constructive algebra , see @xcite ) . following that",
    ", we show that the field of fractional power series algebraic over @xmath9 is algebraically closed .    another contribution of this paper is to analyze in a constructive framework what happens if the field @xmath0 is not supposed to be algebraically closed .",
    "the difference with @xcite , which provides also such an analysis , is that we do not assume the irreducibility of polynomials to be decidable .",
    "this is achieved through the method of _ dynamic evaluation _",
    "@xcite , which replaces factorization by gcd computations . the reference @xcite provides a proof theoretic analysis of this method . + with dynamic evaluation we obtain algebras , _ triangular separable algebras _ , as separable extensions of the base field and the puiseux expansions are given over these algebras .",
    "theorem [ dynamicnewton - extended ] shows that the extensions produced by the algorithm are minimal in the sense that if @xmath10 is one such extension and @xmath11 is any other algebra over the base field such that @xmath12 factors linearly over @xmath13 $ ] for some positive integer @xmath14 , then @xmath11 splits @xmath10 which in case @xmath11 and @xmath10 were fields would be equivalent to saying that @xmath11 contains the normal closure of @xmath10 . but this then shows that @xmath10 splits itself , which in case @xmath10 is a field is equivalent to saying that @xmath10 is a normal extension ( corollary [ spliteachother ] ) .",
    "theorem [ dynamicnormal2 ] will then show that any two triangular separable algebras @xmath11 and @xmath15 that split each other are in fact powers of a some triangular separable algebra , i.e. @xmath16 and @xmath17 for some triangular separable algebra @xmath10 and positive integers @xmath18 .",
    "this algorithm gives less information than duval s rational puiseux expansion algorithm @xcite since we can easily obtain the classical puiseux expansions of a polynomial from the rational ones ( rational puiseux expansions describe the roots of the polynomial by pairs of power series , i.e. a parametrization , with rational coefficients ) . in @xcite the rational expansions of a polynomial @xmath19 $ ] are given as long as @xmath12 is absolutely irreducible , i.e. irreducible in @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 is the algebraic closure of @xmath0 .",
    "it would be interesting to also justify duval s algorithm in a constructive framework .",
