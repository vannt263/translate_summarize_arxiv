    "a large fraction of the rr lyrae stars shows a periodic amplitude and/or phase modulation with a period of typically ten to hundreds of times the pulsation period .",
    "this phenomenon is referred to as the blazhko effect , after the russian astronomer who first reported it ( blazhko 1907 ) .",
    "the origin of the blazhko effect is still a matter of controversy .",
    "the most widely discussed models attribute the effect to either the consequences of the interaction of a magnetic field with the main radial pulsation ( shibahashi & takata 1995 ) , or a resonance between the main mode and a non - radial mode of low degree ( van hoolst , dziembowski & kawaler 1998 ; nowakowski & dziembowski 2001 ; dziembowski & mizerski 2004 ) .",
    "however , also models that do not require nonradial modes have been proposed , e.g. by stothers ( 2006 ) .",
    "this scenario attributes the blazhko variation to a variable turbulent convection due to transient magnetic fields in the star .",
    "all models presently proposed for the blazhko effect have shortcomings in explaining the variety of features shown by blazhko stars .",
    "therefore , theoretical efforts to revise or expand the models would be worthwhile , and even the exploration of alternative explanations .    since its discovery almost a century ago",
    ", most studies of the blazhko effect were carried out from the northern hemisphere ( e.g. , szeidl 1988 , and references therein ; smith 1995 , and references therein ) . for a long time",
    "there were fewer well - established _",
    "blazhko stars at southern declinations . the available data for southern field blazhko stars ( e.g. , hoffmeister 1956 ; kinman 1961 ; clube et al .",
    "1969 ; lub 1977 ) are often insufficient to determine the blazhko periods with the required accuracy .",
    "accurate and complete photometric data sets of southern field blazhko stars are still lacking .",
    "extensive multi - target surveys such as macho ( alcock et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ) and ogle ( moskalik & poretti 2003 ) , and asas ( all sky automated survey , pojmanski 2000 ) have significantly contributed to our knowledge of the blazhko effect , and expanded the list of known blazhko stars .",
    "wils & sodor ( 2005 ) published a list of new and confirmed blazhko targets , and szczygiel & fabrycky ( 2007 ) obtained interesting new results , among which is a star with multiple blazhko periods .",
    "nevertheless , long - term campaigns dedicated to particular blazhko stars and yielding complete light curves at different phases in the blazhko cycle remain of great scientific value .",
    "only these can reveal changes in the light curve shape , as well as long - term changes in the characteristics of the blazhko effect such as amplitudes , phases , and periods . in this way they can give crucial information for deciding among the different hypotheses for the blazhko effect .",
    "photometry with a good spread over both the pulsation and blazhko cycles allows us to perform the first rigorous frequency analysis of a southern field blazhko star .",
    "the first accurate photometric data set covering both the pulsation and the blazhko cycle was published by jurcsik et al .",
    "( 2005a ) for the northern short - period blazhko star rr gem .",
    "ss for ( sao 167572 ; @xmath2 : 02@xmath3 07@xmath4 52@xmath5 , @xmath6 : -26@xmath7 51 54  ) is a relatively bright southern blazhko star . according to the general catalogue of variable stars ( kukarkin 2003 ) its @xmath1 brightness changes within the range 9.45 - 10.60 .",
    "the general catalogue of variable stars ( gcvs ) lists a period of @xmath8 = 0.495432 d ( kholopov et al .",
    "1998 ) or about 11 h 53 min , corresponding to a frequency of @xmath9 cd@xmath10 .",
    "we selected this target on the basis of references to its variable light curve in the literature ( lub 1977 ) .",
    "our analysis of both the hipparcos and the asas-3 photometry demonstrated the existence of a blazhko effect with strong variations around minimum .",
    "the deduced blazhko period of ss for ( about 35 d ) turned out to be short enough to cover several modulation cycles during one observing season .",
    "all our data of ss for are available online at http://www.univie.ac.at / tops / blazhko / data/.    in section2 we present the new observations as well as the asas-3 data used for comparison .",
    "the different steps in the data analysis and its results are described in section3 .",
    "section4 is dedicated to a discussion of the results obtained .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in section5 .",
    "our photometric observations were carried out with 3 different telescopes in the southern hemisphere .",
    "all were equipped with photomultipliers to obtain comparative photometry in the johnson @xmath0 and @xmath1 passbands .",
    "the photometric observations of ss for started from the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) in sutherland , south africa , in october 2004 , and were carried out from the 0.5-m and 0.75-m telescopes until november 2005 .",
    "the 0.5-m telescope was equipped with the modular photometer . at the 0.75-m telescope we used the uct photometer . from july until september 2005 , the 0.6-m telescope at siding spring observatory ( sso ) near coonabarabran , australia , joined in the observing campaign .",
    "its photometer is equipped with a gaas photomultiplier tube .",
    "given the nearly 12-h period of ss for , the complementary longitudes of the two observatories allowed for observations of a larger part of the light curve .",
    "additionally , the height of 1-day aliases introduced by the spectral window ( see also fig.1 ) was decreased by the use of more than one observing site .",
    "this enables an easier and more accurate determination of the frequencies of the stellar light variations .",
    "the total time span of the data set is 345 days , almost 10 blazhko cycles .",
    "the observations were carried out using the 3-star technique , as described by breger ( 1993 ) .",
    "the comparison and check stars were hd13334 ( @xmath2 : 02@xmath3 09@xmath4 45@xmath5 , @xmath6 : -27@xmath7 06 13  , @xmath1 = 9.7 , @xmath11 = 0.57 ) and hd13181 ( @xmath2 : 02@xmath3 08@xmath4 13@xmath5 , @xmath6 : -27@xmath7 01 29  , @xmath1 = 9.8 , @xmath11 = 0.51 ) .",
    "table1 shows a journal of the measurements .",
    "depending on the weather conditions , the accuracy of the individual differential measurements varied between 3 and 10 mmag . in the reduction procedure",
    ", variable atmospheric extinction was taken into account .",
    "the night - to - night shifts of the differential magnitudes of the two comparison stars laid within the scatter of a few millimags .    in order to combine the data sets from the different telescopes and instruments we carried out transformations to the standard system .",
    "this is crucial , since for variables with changing light curve shapes zero point offsets can often not be correctly determined .",
    "moreover , the large variations in the b - v colour ( more than 0.3 mag - see figure3 ) throughout the pulsation cycle result in a considerable distortion of the light curves ( as large as 0.02 - 0.03 mag ) if the colour systems are not the same . for the saao data we used transformation coefficients determined by d. kilkenny ( private communication ) , and from our own standard star measurements . for the sso data we took coefficients determined from standard star measurements by r. shobbrook ( private communication ) , close to the ones given by berndnikov & turner ( 2001 ) .",
    "the light curves of the new data in johnson @xmath0 and johnson @xmath1 , folded with the main pulsation period , are shown in figure2 .",
    "the differential magnitudes are shown with respect to hd13181 .",

    "the triplet structures typical for rr lyrae blazhko stars clearly emerged .    for blazhko stars very often the _ a priori _ choice is made to describe the light curve variations by means of _ equidistant triplets _ at the main frequency and its harmonics according to the formula ( see also kovcs 1995 ) : @xmath13\\\\ + b_0 \\sin ( 2 \\pi ( f_b t + \\phi_b ) ) .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ] the amplitudes and phases are calculated up to order @xmath14 , for which the amplitudes of the higher - order harmonics are still above the significance level . in this formula , @xmath15 is the main pulsation frequency and @xmath16 is the blazhko frequency .    in order not to presume equidistantly spaced triplets we also fitted the data with triplet structures without the condition of equidistance , i.e. the side peak frequencies are `` let free '' .",
    "the resulting departure from equidistance ( see also breger & kolenberg 2006 ) was smaller than the uncertainties on the frequencies , so we can resort to equation ( 1 ) for the triplet fits .",
    "we calculated optimum values for the frequencies , their amplitudes and phases by minimizing the residuals of the fit given by equation(1 ) .",

    "wils & sdor ( 2005 ) published the results of a period analysis of a set of southern rr lyrae stars exhibiting the blazhko effect and published new elements for previously known as well as new and suspected blazhko rrab stars of the asas database .",
    "they determined the blazhko periods of the variables with a fit containing the first four trial modulation frequencies , i.e. , a fit including the triplet components around the main frequency @xmath15 and its harmonic @xmath19 .",
    "on the basis of the earlier asas-3 photometry for ss for , they list a blazhko period of 34.8 d , which corresponds well with the value we find .",

    "when including the asas-3 @xmath1 data in the analysis , we obtain @xmath22 cd@xmath10 for the radial pulsation frequency and @xmath23 cd@xmath10 for the right side peak frequency .",
    "given the longer time span of the data set , we use the frequencies found from the combined asas-3+saao+sso data as _ start values _ for optimization to fit the new data gathered at saao and sso . note that we do not use the asas data to determine the final fit given in table2 .    * the @xmath0 data *    rr lyrae stars have higher amplitudes in the blue region of the spectrum .",

    "since they were based upon a larger and more extended set of data , we used the optimized frequencies of the fit to the @xmath1 data to fit our data obtained in the @xmath0 filter .",
    "given the higher amplitudes in the @xmath0 filter , the harmonics of @xmath15 are significant up to a higher order , @xmath24 . also both triplet components have amplitudes above the @xmath21 noise level ( the adopted threshold for combination frequencies ) up to the 10th order .    * the final fit *    table2 list the results of a multifrequency fit to the combined set of saao+sso data , according to equation ( 1 ) and based on the magnitude differences relative to hd13181 , the comparison star with coordinates closer to ss for and a smaller colour difference to the target .",
    "the results based on the magnitude differences relative to hd13334 differ from the ones published in table2 within the given uncertainties .",
    "note that for independent frequencies ( in this case only @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) to be significant we required a signal - to - noise level exceeding 4 . for combination frequencies we required the signal - to - noise level to be higher than 3.5 .",

    "however , such a simple model seems inadequate to explain the variety of observations related to the blazhko effect , and hence we give table3 rather as light curve diagnostics ( see also smith et al .",
    "1999 and jurcsik et al .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our observed fourier parameters for ss for clearly fall within the ranges of fourier parameters derived from the @xmath1 light curves of 257 rrab stars published by kovcs & kanbur ( 1998 ) .",

    "the blazhko character of ss for was recognized by lub ( 1977 ) , who noticed strong variations around minimum light of the star . at that time , its blazhko period was not known .",
    "wils & sodor ( 2005 ) published a study on blazhko variability from the asas database .",
    "ss for appears in their table with elements of new and suspected blazhko rrab stars .",
    "they determined a blazhko period of 34.8 d. from our new data set we find a value for the blazhko period @xmath111 d , as the difference between @xmath18 and @xmath15 .",
    "the observed asymmetry of the modulation components in the * triplets * , also observed in ss for ( see section3.3.1 ) , remains unexplained by both the resonance model and the magnetic model , at least in the degree it is observed .    in our data",
    "we find clear evidence for * quintuplet components * in the vicinity of the harmonics of the main frequency in our data . a quintuplet structure",
    "is generally predicted by the magnetic model ( shibahashi & takata 1995 ) , where the magnetic field causes the main radial mode to deform and have additional quadrupole ( @xmath112 ) components . for more than",
    "a decade after the magnetic model was first presented , no evidence for quintuplet components was found from any data set .",
    "the argument given by proponents of the magnetic model was that a quintuplet structure may manifest itself as only a triplet depending on the geometrical configuration ( angles of pulsation axis , magnetic axis and aspect angle ) . also , the quintuplet components might have such a low amplitude that they are hidden in the noise of the frequency spectrum .",
    "this is supported by recent findings by hurta et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in rv uma , jurcsik et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in mw lyr , and this work , but it does not imply the magnetic model is the one to be preferred over the resonance model .    a magnetic field of about 1 kg is needed in the magnetic model for the amplitude modulation to be observable ( shibahashi & takata 1995 ) . the only blazhko star for which a dedicated spectropolarimetric campaign has been carried out so far is rr lyr , the prototype of the class , and the results are rather contradictory .",
    "babcock ( 1958 ) and romanov et al . (",
    "1994 ) reported a variable magnetic field in rr lyr with a strength up to 1.5 kg , whereas preston ( 1967 ) and chadid et al .",
    "( 2004 ) contradict these measurements .",
    "the detection of magnetic fields in rr lyrae stars has been hampered by the fact that these stars are quite faint ; rr lyr is by far the brightest with v = 7.2 - 8.2 . with the new generation of powerful spectrographs attached to big telescopes ,",
    "however , many more rr lyrae stars have now come within reach for spectropolarimetry .",
    "interestingly , in this data set we only find clear evidence for quintuplet components around the harmonics of the main frequency and not around the main frequency itself .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the observed amplitude spectrum is also influenced by the coverage of our measurements ( see jurcsik et al .",
    "satellite data with quasi - uninterruped coverage over several blazhko cycles will give an answer to many questions concerning the frequency spectrum of blazhko stars , the modulation components and the occurrence of quintuplet components .",
    "jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 ) , herafter jk96 , determined a @xmath113[fe / h ] relation for fundamental mode rr lyrae stars .",
    "their calibration was based on a sample of 81 rrab field blazhko stars , and its application to rr lyrae stars with independent spectroscopic metallicities has proven that it has an overall prediction accuracy of 0.12 dex ( kovcs 2005 ) .",
    "the question , however , is whether this empirical formula is also applicable to amplitude- and phase - modulated fundamental mode rr lyrae stars .    according to layden ( 1994 ) ,",
    "ss for has a spectroscopic iron abundance [ fe / h]@xmath114= -1.35 , which is -1.09 on the scale of the jk96 relation .",
    "based on asas data , kovcs ( 2005 ) calculated the iron abundance [ fe / h]@xmath115 according to the jk96 formula , and found a @xmath116[fe / h]=[fe / h]@xmath114-[fe / h]@xmath115 of 0.44 .",
    "kovcs ( 2005 ) attributed the large deviation both to an inaccurate spectroscopic iron abundance determination , as well as the light curve shape and therefore fourier parameter variations due to the blazhko effect .",
    "we support the latter explanation , since from our determination of the fourier parameters at different phases in the blazhko cycle , we obtain values for @xmath117 between 4.58 and 5.13 rad ( in the sinus frame , as required for the jk96 formula ) .",
    "this leads to metallicities [ fe / h]@xmath115 between -1.55 and -0.81 , a rather large range but with an average ( -1.18 ) rather close to the spectroscopic value .",
    "based on the result of alcock et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , it is possible that the average light curves of blazhko stars can be employed equally well in the empirical formula calibrated on strictly periodic stars . however , long - term monitoring - from months to years - is needed to achieve sufficient coverage for blazhko variables .",
    "the test can be done for ss for , for which we obtained average light curve parameters with a high accuracy . for the mean light curve , this yields the value @xmath118 ( this corresponds to 0.785 @xmath17 0.009 in fractions of @xmath119 , as can be derived from table2 ) .",
    "application of the jk96 calibration then yields [ fe / h]=-1.07 @xmath17 0.08 , agreeing very well with the value -1.09 by layden ( 1994 ) on the jk96 scale .",
    "while in most blazhko stars the variations of the pulsation maximum are most pronounced , in ss for also the minimum shows strong variations during the blazhko cycle .",
    "these variations have already been reported by lub ( 1977 ) and have been investigated in more detail by guggenberger & kolenberg ( 2006 ) on the basis of the data presented in this paper .",
    "they found a periodic behaviour of the so - called bump in the light curve that appears just before minimum light .",
    "the bump occurs at an earlier phase around blazhko minimum and later around blazhko maximum .",
    "also the strength of the bump shows a dependence on the blazhko phase : the bump is most distinct during minimum and almost vanishes during blazhko maximum .",
    "the bump has been explained by a collision between the free - falling high atmospheric layers and the deep atmosphere , which has a smaller infall velocity ( gillet & crowe 1988 ) . from spectroscopic data of rr lyr ,",
    "preston , smak , & paczynski ( 1965 ) concluded that a displacement of the shock forming region occurs over the blazhko cycle .",
    "this may induce an earlier or later occurence of the bump in the light curves . also the u - b excess observed on the rising branch , as well as the strength of the h emission ( hardie 1955 ) , both linked to the shocks in rr lyrae stars , are variable over the blazhko cycle ( preston , smak , & paczynski1965 ) .",
    "high - precision photometric observations in the johnson @xmath0 and @xmath1 filter were obtained from the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) and siding spring observatory ( sso ) , australia , between october 2004 and september 2005 .",
    "the time span of the data covers almost 10 complete blazhko cycles .",
    "a detailed analysis of the combined standardized photometric measurements led to the following conclusions :    * from a fourier analysis of the combined saao+sso data set we obtain @xmath120 cd@xmath10 for the radial pulsation frequency and @xmath121 cd@xmath10 for the right - side peak frequency . * _ from our data _ we find a value for the blazhko period @xmath111 d. * the amplitudes in the @xmath0 data are a factor of about 1.2 larger than in the @xmath1 data .",
    "the harmonics of the main frequency as well as the triplet structure around the main frequency and its harmonics are detectable up to high order , especially in the @xmath0 data ( 15th order ) .",
    "also the blazhko modulation is a factor of 1.2 larger in the @xmath0 than in the @xmath1 data . * after subtracting the fit including triplet components , we find clear evidence of quintuplet frequencies in the data .",
    "we found several clearly significant peaks located at @xmath122 frequency values .",
    "these frequencies emerged most clearly from the @xmath0 data set in which the modulation components have higher amplitudes , but were also retrieved from the @xmath1 data .",
    "our data thus clearly show the existence of quintuplet components in ss for , as were also found by hurta et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in rv uma and by jurcsik et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in mw lyr .",
    "quintuplet components are predicted by the magnetic model for explaining the blazhko effect ( shibahashi & takata 1995 ) , but so far there has been no convincing , unambiguous positive detection of a magnetic field in rr lyrae stars .",
    "* we also find evidence for a so - called septuplet component in our data ( at @xmath80 ) .",
    "multiplet components of order @xmath85 in @xmath84 have also been found by jurcsik et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in their extensive data set of mw lyr .",
    "they have yet to be explained by the models for the blazhko effect .",
    "uninterrupted satellite data of blazhko stars , covering several blazhko cycles , such as delivered by the corot satellite ( baglin 2007 ) , will undoubtedly shed new light upon the existence of higher - order multiplet structures in blazhko stars .",
    "we may expect to find many more in high - quality data sets .",
    "* a subdivision of the data into 10 blazhko phase intervals shows the variations of the light curve over the blazhko cycle .",
    "as all the blazhko phase intervals in @xmath1 have sufficient coverage , we calculated the fourier parameters and plotted their variations . observed values at different phases of the blazhko cycle may be useful for confrontation with non - linear convective models such as those developed by feuchtinger ( 1999 ) .",
    "it would be worthwhile to find out whether the observed variations in the fourier parameters can be reproduced theoretically for a star with constant mass and metallicity .",
    "* application of the empirical @xmath113[fe / h ] relation developed by jurcsik & kovcs yields a good result for the average light curve derived from all our data .",
    "this strengthens the assumption that the average light curve of blazhko stars can be employed in the empirical formula calibrated by jurcsik & kovcs on stricly periodic stars .",
    "however , the average light curve of a blazhko star can only be determined accurately if the blazhko cycle is sufficiently covered by the available data . * from a study of the light curve shape at different blazhko phases we clearly see that the strong variations around minimum light in ss for are related to the position and strength of the bump .",
    "a detailed study of the bump behaviour over the blazhko cycle , in photometric as well as spectroscopic data , may shed new light upon the understanding of the blazhko effect .",
