    "the large hierarchy between neutrino masses ( @xmath0 ) and the electroweak ( ew ) scale may be regarded a symptom of an hierarchy between the latter and a new mass scale ( @xmath10 ) that holds lepton number ( @xmath11-number ) breaking .",
    "the simplest extensions to the standard model ( sm ) that implement this hypothesis ( type - i seesaws  @xcite ) generate @xmath7  @xcite with the naively expected dimensionful suppression factor of @xmath12 . both direct  @xcite and indirect  @xcite bounds on @xmath0 suggest @xmath10 as heavy as @xmath13 if the underlying parameters are of order one and obey no special relations , as discussed for e.g. in  @xcite and references therein . ] .",
    "one can also conceive that additional mass scales are involved in the making of @xmath7 . if this is the case ,",
    "a broader class of possibilities emerge that may turn out to yield @xmath10 within foreseeable experimental reach :    * the additional scale is the ew scale ( @xmath14 ) . in this case",
    "@xmath7 is not generated in perturbation theory , but higher dimensional operators are .",
    "this replaces the @xmath12 dimensionful suppression by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the dimension of the leading order ( lo ) operator .",
    "see for example  @xcite for a model in which the lo contribution to @xmath0 comes from the dimension-7 operator @xmath17 .",
    "see also  @xcite and references therein . *",
    "the additional scale ( @xmath18 ) is an intermediate scale between @xmath0 and @xmath10 . in this case",
    "@xmath7 is suppressed by some power of @xmath19 .",
    "for example , in the inverse seesaw  @xcite @xmath18 is connected to some small ( @xmath20 ) @xmath11-number breaking scale that is transmitted to the actual leptons by dynamics at the scale @xmath10 . in the type - ii seesaw  @xcite @xmath18",
    "could be the coupling scale of the scalar triplet to the higgses .",
    "both examples lead to a @xmath21 dimensionful suppression .",
    "in addition , if @xmath7 is radiatively generated  @xcite , loop factors and many coupling dependence may help bringing @xmath10 close to the tev scale .",
    "this possibility arises naturally in models in which the sector holding @xmath11-number breaking is charged under a symmetry with respect to ( w.r.t . ) which @xmath11 and @xmath22 are neutral .",
    "such a symmetry may find its motivation connected to the stability of dark matter , as discussed in  @xcite",
    ". for studies in the space of one - loop seesaw models see  @xcite .",
    "two new scales are introduced by supersymmetric ( susy ) extensions to the sm : the soft susy breaking ( @xmath1 ) scale , @xmath23 ; and the scale at which @xmath1 takes place , @xmath24 .",
    "naive dimensional analysis gives us grounds to speculate that @xmath24 is much heavier than @xmath23 , since the strengths of hard- and soft-@xmath1 are related by powers of @xmath25 ( see for e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) introduces yet another scale : the higgs bilinear , @xmath26 .",
    "though , in general , correct ew symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) requires @xmath27 .",
    "do any of these scales play any role in neutrino mass generation ?",
    "it has been contemplated in  @xcite that hard-@xmath1 is the source of @xmath11-number violation , so that @xmath28 might be the reason for @xmath29 .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 generates @xmath30 , then @xmath31 arises at one - loop level via a ewino - slepton loop and is suppressed by @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "another possible connection to @xmath1 is in identifying the seesaw mediators with the mediators of @xmath1 to the visible sector  @xcite .",
    "holomorphy dictates that tree - level type - i and -iii  @xcite seesaws are superpotential operators that yield @xmath31 , whereas the tree - level type - ii  @xcite gives , in addition to @xmath31 from the superpotential , @xmath32 from the khler potential l l f_h_d^h^_d d^4 l l h^_d h^_d d^4 ^. hence , the khler contribution to neutrino masses is proportional to @xmath1 , since it requires @xmath33 .",
    "if the low energy higgs sector coincides with that of the mssm , then @xmath34 which leads to a @xmath32 operator with a dimensionful suppression factor of @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the khler operator is usually disregarded in favour of the superpotential operator which has a @xmath36 dependence . however , as they involve two different couplings , it is conceivable that the coupling enabling the superpotential operator is sufficiently suppressed so that the khler operator is the leading one .",
    "khler operators as leading contributions to @xmath0 have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the susy non - renormalisation theorem , which asserts that radiative corrections are @xmath37-terms , we study how radiative seesaw models are sensitive to different sources of @xmath1 ( ) . although @xmath11-number breaking can possibly arise from @xmath1 , i.e.  from the vev of an auxiliary rather than scalar field ( see for e.g.  @xcite ) , in here we assume that they are broken separately - number are very different symmetries , that the two are broken separately seems to be a plausible assumption . ]",
    "so that the non - renormalisation theorem is the only bridge between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we thus assume that the radiative seesaw models are realised in the superpotential at a @xmath11-number breaking scale @xmath10 that is higher than the scale of soft-@xmath1 effects involving the seesaw mediators .",
    "we classify the @xmath1 contributions to neutrino mass operators w.r.t .  their involvement in ewsb as follows : @xmath2 contributions are those which involve @xmath1 vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the form f^ = _ h _ h h + _ h _ h h h 0   d = g _ h h^_h h 0 , where @xmath22 s are fields whose vevs break the ew symmetry ( ews ) ; while @xmath5 contributions correspond to those in which at least one @xmath1 vev is unrelated to ewsb .",
    "we apply the prefix `` pure '' to refer to a contribution in which all @xmath1 vevs have the same origin in the classification above .",
    "for example , the tree - level type - ii seesaw khler operator is a pure-@xmath2 contribution to neutrino masses .    in this context",
    ", it is interesting to note that if ewsb is _ almost _ susy , in the sense that there is a susy vacuum with ewsb  @xcite , and so that only small @xmath1 effects are responsible for lifting its degeneracy with ews vacua , then @xmath2 contributions can be quite small due to @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( i.e.  vanish up to possibly small @xmath1 effects ) .",
    "however , in this work we focus on models with the low energy higgs sector of the mssm , and thus , in which @xmath2 contributions have the form & f^_h_u , d = h_d , u , + & d_u(1)_y = ( |h_u |^2 - |h_d |^2 ) ,   d^3_su(2)_l = ( -|h_u |^2 +     as we will see in  sec .",
    "[ sec : radiative_seesaw ] , contributions to neutrino mass operators whose dependence on @xmath1 arises entirely by means of @xmath1 sources involved in ewsb are expected to be suppressed by some power of @xmath40 or be of dimension higher than @xmath41 and involve gauge couplings . exploiting the power of the susy non - renormalisation in the space of radiative seesaw models , we then investigate if models exist in which the pure-@xmath2 contribution to neutrino masses either vanishes or is subleading w.r.t .",
    "the contribution from @xmath5 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : sopbreak ] ) .",
    "we catalogue one - loop model - topologies in which the leading contribution comes from soft-@xmath5 in  sec .  [ sec : looking ] .",
    "an explicit model example is presented in  sec .",
    "[ sec : model_example ] and consists of a one - loop type - ii seesaw in which the leading pure-@xmath2 contribution is of dimension-7  comprising contributions @xmath6 and @xmath42  , whereas the leading contribution from @xmath5 is of dimension-5 and has the dimensionful dependence @xmath8 or @xmath9 , the latter corresponding to pure-@xmath5 contributions .    our analysis will be carried out using perturbation theory in superspace ( supergraph techniques ) , as it renders the susy non - renormalisation theorem a very simple statement and its implications in terms of component fields easier to identify .",
    "points of contact with results in terms of component fields will be established throughout .",
    "another advantage is that perturbation theory in superspace is much simpler than the ordinary qft treatment .",
    "for instance , aside from the algebra of the susy covariant derivatives ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , supergraph calculations in a renormalisable susy model made of chiral scalar superfields resemble the feynman diagrammatic approach to an ordinary qft made of scalars with trilinear interactions .",
    "@xmath1 can be parameterised in a manifestly supersymmetric manner by introducing superfields with constant @xmath45-dependent values ( @xmath1 spurions ) .",
    "thus , @xmath1 effects will be conveniently taken into account in supergraph calculations by means of considering couplings to external @xmath1 spurions  @xcite .",
    "this allows one to see the @xmath5 contributions to neutrino masses as small @xmath1 effects upon a fundamentally susy topology .",
    "let @xmath46 be the set of operators that contribute to neutrino masses once the ew symmetry is broken and @xmath47 be the set of superfield operators ( superoperators ) that yield at least an @xmath48 .",
    "if neutrino masses are radiatively generated the susy non - renormalisation theorem asserts that for every @xmath48 there exists an @xmath49 such that d^4 .",
    "hence , as any @xmath48 is of the form @xmath50 , every @xmath49 belongs to one of two classes : d^2 ( l l h^n ) a   l l b , with d^4a ,   d^2|b , and where @xmath51 stands for conceivable insertions of superfields that yield higgses at @xmath52 ( a limit hereafter denoted by @xmath53 ) .",
    "class a superoperators are naturally generated in radiative type - ii seesaws in which the one - particle reducible ( 1pr ) propagator does not undergo a chirality flip ( i.e.  is of the form @xmath54 ) , whereas class b arise in radiative type - i and -iii seesaws , radiative type - ii seesaws with a chirality flip and one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) seesaws .",
    "see  fig .",
    "[ fig : sgraph_general_llhiggses ] .",
    "we note that type - i and -iii without a chirality flip do not yield an @xmath48 ( even in the presence of @xmath1 ) because d^4 d^2 ( l h _ x )   l l ... , [ eq : typeiandiii_withoutchiralityflip ] where @xmath55 is any superoperator containing one @xmath56 and @xmath57 accounts for conceivable insertions of @xmath1 spurions . in terms of component fields",
    "this can be seen to follow from the fact that , without a chirality flip in the 1pr spinor line , the result is always proportional to external momenta ( @xmath58 ) . to illustrate this ,",
    "consider a model in which @xmath59 and @xmath60 are superpotential terms and @xmath61 is radiatively generated .",
    "( the coupling @xmath62 can be forbidden by @xmath11-number conservation , which is spontaneously broken by @xmath63 . ) in such a model , the type - i ( or -iii ) diagram without a chirality flip arises from the @xmath64 propagator in conjunction with the terms l h_u n d^2 l h_u n   n^p l h_u d^4 n^l h_u , and leads to @xmath31 with an overall dependence on @xmath65 or , more precisely , @xmath66 . in terms of supergraphs this result follows from - ( l h_u ) l h_u d^4 d^2 ( l h_u ) l h_u , which should be compared with  eq.([eq : typeiandiii_withoutchiralityflip ] ) .",

    "in this appendix we show that , by relying just on the renormalisability of the superpotential , some four - scalar couplings can be genuinely radiative .",
    "let @xmath76 be a chiral scalar superfield of components @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "in each statement we increase @xmath80 whenever a field / superfield is introduced that does not need to have the identity of a previously introduced field / superfield .",

    "in this way no _ a priori _ assumption is made regarding the form of the superpotential .",
    "the only radiative possibility for renormalisable spinor - scalar interactions is ( schematically ) d^4 x^_1 x_2 x_3 f^_1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4 _ 2 _ 3 .",

    "<S> in addition to contributions from sources of @xmath1 that are involved in electroweak symmetry breaking ( @xmath2 contributions ) , and which are manifest from @xmath3 and @xmath4 , radiatively generated @xmath0 can also receive contributions from @xmath1 sources that are unrelated to ewsb ( @xmath5 contributions ) . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that recent literature overlooks pure-@xmath2 contributions ( @xmath6 ) that can arise at the same order of perturbation theory as the leading order contribution from @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that there exist realistic radiative seesaw models in which the leading order contribution to @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath5 . to our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> no model with such a feature exists in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we give a complete description of the simplest model - topologies and their leading dependence on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in one - loop realisations @xmath7 operators are suppressed by at least @xmath8 or @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we construct a model example based on a one - loop type - ii seesaw . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting aspect of these models lies in the fact that the scale of soft-@xmath1 effects generating the leading order @xmath0 can be quite small without conflicting with lower limits on the mass of new particles .    </S>",
