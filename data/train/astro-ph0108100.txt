    "the dwarf spheroidal galaxy in draco ( hereafter called draco dsph or simply draco ) , located at a distance of about 71  kpc ( see   5.1 ) , is one of the two least luminous of these companions",
    ". estimates of the dynamical masses of the milky way dwarf satellites based on their spatial extent and internal velocity dispersion lead to the conclusion that most of them have high mass - to - light ratios ( 30 - 100 ) and hence must contain large amounts of dark matter ( see mateo 1998 and references therein ) .",

    "+ however , even with a large fraction of dark matter the total masses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies like draco are at most a few @xmath16 @xmath17 while their spatial extent is several hundred parsecs . therefore these systems are susceptible to perturbations by the tidal forces of the galactic potential if their orbits are sufficiently eccentric to bring them to galactocentric distances of about 20 kpc or closer . as the result of such perturbations , a dwarf galaxy may lose significant amounts of mass and eventually be disrupted .",

    "traces of the orbits of the dwarf galaxies would also provide constraints on the gravitational potential of the galactic halo ( e.g. , kuhn 1993 , johnston et al .",
    "if a dwarf galaxy is tidally perturbed it may be incorrect to estimate its mass via the assumption of dynamical equilibrium .",
    "kuhn & miller ( 1989 ) have argued that tidal heating can inflate the velocity dispersion of a dwarf galaxy and hence lead to overestimated masses and mass - to - light ratios .",
    "numerical simulations by klessen & kroupa ( 1998 ) have shown that in the extreme case of complete disruption the observed properties of local dwarf galaxies may under certain conditions be explicable without any dark matter .",
    "this point however is controversial ( see olszewski 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) found that even when tides affect the structure and the kinematics of a dwarf spheroidal , they fail to inflate the central mass - to - light ratio .",

    "in @xmath0 we imposed a limit of @xmath78  mag , because the data from different observing runs have somewhat different limiting magnitudes and completeness limits that begin to show up by spatial inhomogeneities beyond @xmath79  mag .",

    "our samples thus reveal the spatial distribution of draco with 15 to 20 times higher contrast than the previous map of ih95 which has a central density contrast of about 4 .",
    "+ we note that a few small areas ( diameter @xmath87 ) in the central part of draco show a pronounced lack of stars because the source detection and photometry has been hampered by the presence of a very bright foreground star .",
    "these regions have either been omitted from the analysis ( e.g.  in the fitting procedures ) or else recovered by interpolation of the stellar density in the surroundings .      the spatial distribution of the stars in s1 and s2 is shown in fig .",

    "overlayed are contour lines of constant surface density . the surface density has been derived through counts on @xmath88 by @xmath88 grid and subsequent weighted averaging within a radius of two grid steps in the outer part and one grid step in the inner part of the field .",

    "both samples show that the overall distribution of draco stars is approximately ellipsoidal . with respect to the inner part",

    "also , the contour lines for s2 are in general less smooth than those for s1 .",
    "nevertheless , there are no clear deviations from an elliptic shape down to the 2@xmath89 contour .",
    "this contour reaches out to @xmath68 angular distance from the center of draco .",
    "+ strong departures from an elliptic shape are visible only at the 1@xmath89 level . here",

    "there appear to be weak extensions in four directions out to radii of about @xmath92 .",

    "distance from the center of draco the field is sprinkled with numerous patches of 1@xmath89 overdensities .",
    "about one third of them are visible also on the 2@xmath89 level .",
    "these patches are distributed rather uniformly , and do not form large connected structures .",
    "altogether they cover an area of no more than 30% of the total field .",
    "this suggests that these patches simply reflect random fluctuations of the residual field star population .",
    "a closer look at the statistics of the outer fields supports this view . in fig .",
    "5 we show histograms and cumulative distributions of the local s2 field star densities measured in non - overlapping grid cells of @xmath93 and @xmath94 beyond @xmath92 distance from the center of draco .",
    "the open circles show poisson distributions for the observed mean values .",
    "the measured fluctuations are in close agreement and indeed statistically consistent with the corresponding poisson models .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnow test shows that the opposite hypothesis , namely that the empirical distribution is different from the poisson model , has in both cases a probability of not more than 2% .",
    "thus we conclude that the number of grid cells with surface densities of e.g.  1@xmath89 or 2@xmath89 above the mean does not significantly exceed the number expected from poisson noise of a random distribution .",
    "( cf .  fig .",
    "hence there is no evidence , and indeed little room , for overdensities that can be ascribed to draco .",
    "another way to show that the density enhancements around draco in the maps of fig .",
    "4 are random fluctuations is by comparing the observations with a random number generated star field of equal mean density .",
    "6 shows such a simulated field corresponding to sample s2 .",
    "the surface density has been derived using the same pixel grid and smoothing and the density contours are drawn on the same levels as for s2 in fig .",
    "the @xmath95 and @xmath96 contours in the simulated map show structures that are very similar in size and number to those in the maps drawn from the observational data .",
    "+ density fluctuations of the field star population must of course also occur in the region where the draco galaxy is seen .",
    "the superposition of these fluctuations with the low density of draco stars in the outermost parts of the galaxy is likely to create distortions in the 1@xmath89 contour around draco .",
    "this is also nicely revealed by the simulated example of fig .  6 .",
    "since the four weak extensions which are visible in fig .",
    "4b and which have been described above are not substantially larger than the sizes of the 1@xmath89 patches in the outer field it is very likely that these extensions are also due to fluctuations in the density of residual field stars . at least , these structures are no significant indication of the presence of draco stars .    in summary , we find that down to the level of 2@xmath89 above the background density of our maps the draco dsph has a fairly regular shape , and that there are no detectable traces of tail - like extensions down to @xmath90 of the central density .",
    "+      the stringent non - detection of tidal tail features on our new draco maps contradicts the previous conclusions of skh97 , who derived mean surface densities in fields of @xmath97 along the principal axes of draco . for a direct comparison with the skh97 results",

    "the mean density in each field is normalized to the mean density in the central field , and an estimate of the foreground density is subtracted .",
    "our estimate of the mean foreground density , however , relies not only on one remote field as in skh97 , but on all stars with more than @xmath99 distance from the center of draco .",
    "the fields at @xmath100 mean angular distance from the center of draco have scaled densities of about 0.15 with respect to the mean density of the central field , compared to 0.12 reported by skh97 .",
    "in contrast to skh97 , we do not observe significant overdensities along the major axis far from the center of draco in either of our two samples . in the more distant fields",
    ", the mean density agrees with the density level of foreground stars within the statistical errors .",
    "there is no general difference between the mean densities measured along the major axis and those measured along the minor axis beyond a distance of @xmath101 from the center .",
    "however , there are of course statistical fluctuations in the mean densities of the individual fields along both axes",
    "7 shows that the reference foreground field for skh97 ( i.e. , at @xmath102 north of draco ) is the one with the lowest mean density in our series of fields . we would obtain significant overdensities in most of the other fields if we chose this particular field as a reference .",
    "this suggests that the overdensities reported by skh97 reflect to a large extent an underestimated foreground density .",
    "the resolution of this apparent discrepancy shows once more the power of wide area data .",
    "to quantify the size , shape and orientation of the draco dsph we fit two - dimensional models to the observed surface densities .",
    "herein we use the empirical king profile ( king 1962 , hererafter k62 ; eq.3a ) , the theoretical king profile ( king 1966 , hereafter k66 ) , and a generalized exponential ( sersic 1968 ; eq.3b ) :    @xmath103    @xmath104    in all cases @xmath105 is the elliptical radius and @xmath106 the coordinate aligned with the major axis .",

    "+ the assumption that `` mass follows light '' might be wrong in the sense that the dark matter component which is likely to exist and to dominate the matter content of draco ( see  5.2 and  6.2 ) could have a less concentrated distribution than the luminous matter , as is often found to be the case in stellar systems that contain dark matter .",

    "this example demonstrates that the mass estimate derived by eq.5 , assuming that all matter in draco follows the distribution of the stars , should be regarded as a lower limit because a more shallow distribution of the dark matter component would result in a considerably higher total mass .",
    "we determined the total luminosity of the draco dsph by ( 1 ) summing up the @xmath10 band fluxes of all possible draco members in the magnitude interval @xmath187 , ( 2 ) subtracting the expected contribution of flux from foreground stars , and ( 3 ) adding an estimate of the missing flux from draco stars at @xmath188 .",

    "as a further check we mention that an erroneous inclusion or omission of up to three stars at the bright end of draco s giant branch ( @xmath195 ) would change @xmath194 by not more than 0.04  mag , which is only half of the quoted error bar .",
    "+ the missing flux from faint stars beyond our magnitude cut - off was estimated by analysing deep hst observations of a small field near the center of draco ( grillmair et al .  1998 ) .",

    "we integrated the @xmath199 band counts from hst between @xmath200 and @xmath201 and extrapolated the integral to @xmath202 , i.e.  @xmath202 for draco . ] assuming a constant slope of the luminosity function .",
    "we then scaled the result with the ratio between the number of draco stars in the ( global ) sdss sample and the number in the ( local ) hst sample , both counted in the overlap interval .",

    "the uncertainty of the absolute magnitude is dominated by the uncertainty of the distance modulus of 0.2  mag .    for conversion to solar units we used basic photometric data for the sun given in landolt - brnstein ( 1981 ) and an empirical transformation relation between standard photometry and sdss photometry ( grebel et al .",

    "this is in good agreement with earlier determinations of @xmath215 ) made in a different wavelength range , e.g. by ih95 who give the luminosity of draco as @xmath216 .",

    "as for the values for the total mass , the mass - to - light ratios are valid only on the proviso that the assumptions mentioned in ",
    "note however , that the true mass of the system would need to be smaller by a factor of 30 or more in order to achieve a normal mass - to - light ratio of 1  3 in solar units . on the other hand",
    "it has been shown that a distribution of dark matter that is less concentrated than the distribution of the stars would result in an increase of the total mass by up to a factor of 45 and thus lead to a further increase of the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "+ an additional argument for a high mass - to - light ratio comes from the size limit that is imposed by the galactic tidal forces .",
    "this argument is independent from the above direct estimate of draco s total mass since it relies only on the observed maximum spatial extent and the luminosity . for a satellite of mass @xmath147 orbiting in a spherically symmetric potential at (",
    "constant ) galactocentric distance @xmath221 there exists a well - defined theoretical size limit that is given by the lagrange radius @xmath222 characterizing the force balance between internal gravity , differential centrifugal forces and the galactic tidal field .",
    "taking a logarithmic potential with circular velocity @xmath223  as a standard model for the gravitational potential in the galactic halo , the lagrange radius is given by the relation :    @xmath224    fig .",
    "11 shows @xmath222 as a function of galactocentric distance @xmath221 for different satellite masses @xmath147 ( dashed lines ) and different mass - to - light ratios ( solid lines ) , adopting the observed luminosity @xmath225 of draco .",
    "the fact that no signs of tidal perturbation have been detected suggests that at least the currently observed part of draco s stellar distribution does not reach beyond the lagrange radius .",
    "therefore we have the condition @xmath226 .",
    "the measured limiting radius @xmath7 is drawn as the hatched bar in fig .",
    "the galactocentric radial velocity of draco , which is near @xmath27100  , indicates that draco is not on a circular orbit .",
    "nevertheless , one can use @xmath222 for obtaining an approximate size limit .",
    "the appropriate distance @xmath221 at which to take @xmath222 is in this case however not evident ; it might be the pericentric distance @xmath227 rather than the current distance @xmath228 .",
    "since @xmath227 can not be estimated without reliable information on the tangential velocity , one has to consider a wide range of distances @xmath229 .",
    "11 reveals that for any such choice of @xmath221 a normal mass - to - light ratio of @xmath230 yields lagrange radii that are substantially smaller than the observed limiting radius @xmath7 for which we here take the conservative value of @xmath101 or 820pc .",
    "hence a normal value of @xmath231 is ruled out within the context of our assumptions .",
    "possible values of @xmath231 in the sense that @xmath232 holds for distances well below @xmath228 lie near or above @xmath233 . with @xmath234 , i.e. a satellite mass of about @xmath235 as derived by direct mass estimation with eq .  5",
    ", the observed size of draco remains below the theoretical limit of @xmath222 down to galactocentric distances of 20 to 25  kpc .",
    "this means that a mass - to - light ratio of about 100 or higher can prevent tidal stripping of stars from the outermost part of draco even in relatively close approaches to the milky way .",
    "it must however be noted that this is a stationary picture . in reality",
    "a passage of the galactic center on an elongated orbit could have the additional effect of heating the stellar population of the satellite due to the non - stationarity of the tidal forces .",
    "this kind of influence on the internal kinematics of the satellite system is not accounted for by the simple lagrange radius criterion .",
    "from the results of previous studies , in particular those of ih95 and skh97 , one might have expected that a high contrast map of the draco galaxy down to magnitude 22 would show clear signs of tidal features .",
    "our analysis of the sdss data shows that this is not the case .",
    "structures which could be interpreted as indicating tail - like extensions appear only on the 1@xmath89 level of our most sensitive map , i.e. , at @xmath236 of the galaxy s central density . since these structures go into four different directions their interpretation in terms of tidal tails is problematic .",
    "the more bar - like structures seen towards the south - east and the north - west would appear as the preferred candidates for such tails .",
    "however , by statistical analysis of the density variations in the surrounding field we find that the observed amount of structure at 1@xmath89 above background density is easily explicable by normal poisson noise . therefore ,",
    "none of the extensions in the vicinity of the main body of draco nor any of the overdense patches seen at larger angular distance are likely to be an external part of its stellar population .",
    "on the other hand , the radial profile of the surface density shows that the ordinary spatial extent of the draco galaxy is substantially larger than was revealed by previous measurements with lower contrast .",
    "going down to about @xmath6 of the central density , the observed radial density profiles directly reveal that draco extends to about @xmath101 . the same is found by fitting ellipsoidal models to the observed surface density distribution .",
    "a k62 profile yields a best - fit @xmath7 of @xmath237 ( s1 ) and @xmath238 ( s2 ) , which is 1.4 times the previous determination ( all radii referring to the major axis ) . using the profile of the k66 theoretical models",
    "one obtains an even larger estimate of @xmath239 .",
    "the observations do however not provide particular support for a truncated radial profile .",
    "we find that a model with generalized exponential profile and exponent @xmath240 fits the surface density distribution equally well or even slightly better .",
    "thus it is possible that the density profile of the galaxy continues further outwards and that its true limit lies at densities that are below the current observational noise level . + in the light of these results , piatek et al.s recent evidence for draco stars immediately beyond the border of the standard ellipse of semi - major axis 283 ( fields e1 , w1 , se1 of piatek et al .",
    "2001 ) has to be understood as a detection of the ordinary draco population and is not an indication of an extratidal component .",
    "piatek et al .",
    "claim that there is also weak evidence for draco stars in their fields e2 and w2 , i.e.  at angular distances of about @xmath241 from the center .",
    "however they say that one may disagree with this view because their data are such that they can neither prove nor disprove the presence of draco stars at these larger radii .",

    "yet , the color - magnitude filter provides us with the advantage of a much higher contrast .",
    "our counts of specifically `` draco - like '' stars thus prove that surface densities as high as those reported by ih95 , which are ten times higher than in our samples , can not be due to draco members .",
    "an extratidal draco component with a surface density as given by ih95 is clearly ruled out .",
    "instead , we attribute the counts of ih95 beyond @xmath101 to residual foreground field stars .",
    "+ the results of the study by skh97 , which also favored an extratidal draco component , have turned out to be at least doubtful .",
    "a detailed comparison , for which mean densities were determined in the same fields as observed by skh97 , revealed that their detection of overdensities may be due to an accidental underestimation of the density of foreground stars and thus spurious .",
    "we find that the field that was used to set the foreground reference in skh97 has an extraordinarily low surface density of `` draco - like '' stars which is not representative of other and more distant fields .",
    "with respect to the mean density of stars at more than @xmath99 distance from draco we do not find significant overdensities in the skh97 fields .",
    "+ in total , there remains no convincing evidence for an extratidal draco component .",
    "this however does not necessarily mean that such a component is completely absent .",
    "for the magnitude range down to @xmath79 , i.e.   the giant branch , horizontal branch and subgiant branch , our study yields upper density limits of @xmath90 times the central density ( from the two - dimensional distributions ) and of @xmath6 times the central density ( from the radial profiles ) .",
    "the latter limit corresponds to a surface brightness of about 33.5  magarcsec@xmath86 . in a recent numerical study of the dynamical evolution of dwarf galaxies in a milky way halo potential mayer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found tidal streams with a maximum surface brightness of 30  magarcsec@xmath86 .",
    "an extratidal draco component on this level of surface brightness would have shown up in our data and can therefore be ruled out .",
    "extratidal extensions with surface brightness below the above given limits may however exist .",
    "n - body simulations of the tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies by oh , lin & aarseth ( 1995 ) have indeed produced tidal tails with surface densities between @xmath248 and @xmath6 of the central density of the dwarf .",
    "thus it may be that despite the significant improvement in surface density contrast our maps of draco are not yet sensitive enough to reach the level at which tidally induced extensions turn up . at magnitudes beyond our cut - off",
    ", nothing is known about signs of tidal perturbation because no observations are available so far except for the very center of draco . since one does not expect mass segregation to be present in such a low - density system like draco tidal effects should in this case not depend on the brightness of the tracer population .",
    "therefore the above given limit in relative surface density should hold also for fainter stars . however , fainter stars , i.e.  in the region of the main - sequence turn - off and below , have the advantage of being much more numerous than those on the giant and subgiant branch ( see the luminosity function fig .  10b ) . on the other hand",
    "the number of field stars with colors in the range of the draco turn - off will not increase accordingly , because the contaminating stars in this part of the cmd will be halo turn - off and main sequence stars at about the same distance as draco .",
    "thus , from the point of number statistics and contrast , draco stars at and beyond @xmath249 mag appear to be much better suited for an eventual detection of an extratidal component .",
    "the goal of future wide - field studies of draco must therefore be to push the magnitude limit down to below the main sequence turn - off .",
    "+ since there is no evidence for an extratidal component around draco ( down to the above limit of surface density ) the question arises why other milky way dsph s such as sagittarius , ursa major and carina do show tidal effects ( see  1 ) while draco does not .",
    "the clearest evidence of tidal perturbation undoubtedly exists for the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "the case of sagittarius is however not comparable to any of the other known milky way companions since it is much closer to the galactic center ( @xmath250  kpc for sagittarius , @xmath251  kpc for other mw dsph s ) .",
    "thus for sagittarius one can directly infer from its current position that it must be subject to strong tidal forces whereas this is not certain for other more distant dwarf spheroidals as long as their orbits are unknown .",
    "in other words , it is by no means clear whether draco or any of the other dsph s has penetrated as deeply into the galactic potential during its history as we presently observe it for the sagittarius .",
    "the ursa major dsph is comparable to draco in that its present galactocentric distance ( @xmath252  kpc , mateo 1998 ) is similar to that of draco , that it has a very low luminosity , and that a very high mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath253 , mateo 1998 ) is obtained via conventional mass estimation based on the central velocity dispersion . on the other hand ,",
    "the morphology of the ursa major dsph is quite different from that of draco because it is much more flattened ( @xmath254 , ih95 ) and reveals a clumpy internal structure ( ih95 ; kleyna et al .",
    "these peculiarities suggest that the ursa major dsph has undergone much stronger tidal interactions with the galaxy than draco .",
    "it is then not so surprising that ursa major ( in contrast to draco ) has a supposedly extratidal halo with a surface density of about @xmath245 of the central surface density as found by martinez - delgado et al .",
    "the reason might be that ursa major is on a galactic orbit that has smaller pericentric distance than the orbit of draco .",
    "in this case it would however be unlikely that draco and ursa major belong to the same great circle stream as proposed by lynden - bell & lynden - bell ( 1995 ) .",
    "the key to answering these questions lies in precise measurements of the tangential velocities ( see end of ",
    "the case of the carina dwarf spheroidal is difficult to understand as long as no information on its orbit is available . with a galactocentric distance of about 100  kpc ( mateo 1998 ) it is presently much more distant than draco",
    ", so strong tidal perturbations seem a priori less likely . on the other hand , majewski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have identified an extended distribution of carina - like giants with a surface density on the level of about @xmath245 times the central surface density and a shallow radial profile which is thought to be rather typical of an extratidal component .",
    "the fact that carina s total mass as estimated in the usual way from its velocity dispersion and its surface density profile ( @xmath255 , mateo 1998 ) is a factor of two to three lower than the likewise estimated total mass of draco is not sufficient to explain the apparently very different amounts of tidal mass loss from these objects .",
    "one may wonder whether the remarkably different star formation histories of carina and draco perhaps indicates fundamental differences in the evolution of the two galaxies that could have an impact also on the existence of an extratidal component .",
    "apart from setting a new and stringent upper limit on the surface density of extratidal stars around draco , the sdss data provide us with improved knowledge of the structure and the basic parameters of draco s main body .",
    "we find that its spatial extent and projected shape is essentially that of an ellipsoid with a core radius of about 160  pc ( referring to a decline to about 26% of the central surface density ) , an outer radius of at least 820  pc ( both along major axis ) , and a radius - independent ellipticity of 0.29 .",
    "there is possibly a 10% deviation from this simple symmetric structure in the outer part .",
    "the simplicity of the spatial structure of the draco dsph is a very important fact , as is the lack of evidence for an extratidal component around it , because both findings lend support to the fundamental assumption that the system is in dynamical equilibrium or at least close to it .",
    "this is one of the key assumptions generally made in order to estimate the dynamical masses of systems like the dwarf spheroidals .",
    "the shape of draco s radial density profile further suggests that a king model should indeed be an acceptable approximation of the system . under these assumptions and in combination with kinematic data the spatial characteristics of the system",
    "imply that it has a total mass of 2.2 - 3.5@xmath256 .",
    "if the distribution of mass in draco is less spatially concentrated than is indicated by its luminous matter , the total mass out to @xmath7 could be by up to a factor of 45 higher . to check",
    "whether the equilibrium hypothesis and the dynamical model is really adequate one would need detailed information on the velocity profile of draco , which is currently not known .",
    "a more definitive answer on the question of the total mass of draco must therefore still await future detailed kinematic measurements .",
    "+ the luminosity of draco has been determined in a straightforward and model - independent way by integrating the observed flux on draco s giant branch , horizontal branch , and subgiant branch over the complete volume of the galaxy . for the residual luminosity from draco stars beyond the magnitude limit of the sdss sample",
    "we also obtained a direct and almost assumption - free estimate using supplementary draco data from hst .",
    "the resulting total magnitude of @xmath257 covers the complete range from the brightest giants at @xmath258 down to the presumed maximum of the luminosity function at @xmath259 .",
    "thus there remains little room for significant deficits due to still unaccounted contributions of light .",
    "the total @xmath10 band luminosity is @xmath260 , clearly demonstrating that the draco dsph is substantially less luminous than the brightest globular clusters in our galaxy although it is at least a factor of 10 more spatially extended ( in the sense of its linear diameter ) than those clusters .",
    "+ the low luminosity is in obvious contrast with the estimated total mass of draco .",
    "a total mass of 2.2 - 3.5@xmath261 yields a global mass - to - light ratio of 92 - 146  @xmath262 with respect to the @xmath10 band , which lies at least 1.5 orders of magnitude above the normal values of the mass - to - light in systems with similar content of luminous matter , namely globular clusters ( 1 - 3 @xmath263 ) . in the compilation of mateo ( 1998 , table 4 )",
    "the only other local group dwarf galaxy with a similarly high @xmath231 is ursa minor , while most other dsphs have estimated @xmath231 ratios @xmath264 .",
    "taken at face value , the above mass - to - light ratio necessarily implies that draco must be dominated by some sort of dark matter component .",
    "even if our mass estimate were wrong by a factor of 2 - 5 , the conclusion that a large fraction of the mass in draco must come from a dark component is inescapable .",
    "a deviation from the assumption that `` mass follows light '' , in the sense that the dark matter component in draco could  as in other galaxies  be less concentrated than the visible matter , would further increase the mass - to - light ratio .    hence there exist essentially two possibilities : ( a ) the conventional mass estimates must deviate strongly from the true mass so that the real mass - to - light ratio is normal",
    ". this could be the case if the system is very far from equilibrium or unbound .",
    "( b ) the draco dwarf must contain a large fraction of its mass as dark matter , whatever the exact quantity of this component may be .",
    "the fact that the spatial structure of the draco population does not reveal any sign of a perturbation of its internal dynamics makes the first possibility unlikely and points towards the second one .",
    "+ using a simple logarithmic halo potential we showed that constraints from the galactic tidal field strongly support this conclusion . with a normal mass - to - light ratio , which means a total mass of not more than @xmath265 , the observed size of draco",
    "would clearly exceed the lagrange limit for any reasonable value of the galactocentric distance .",
    "hence the outer part of draco should be heavily affected by tidal stripping , which is not observed .",
    "how much higher the mass - to - light ratio has to be depends on how closely draco s orbit approaches the milky way .",
    "taking twice the value of the radial velocity as a guess for the unknown tangential velocity yields a hypothetical pericentric distance of 48  kpc . to reach consistency between the measured radius @xmath7 and the lagrange limit down to this pericentric distance",
    "a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath266 is required .",
    "values near @xmath267 would enable draco to maintain its current size even at pericentric distances of 25  kpc . whether draco is likely to come that close to the galaxy",
    "can only be found out with very precise measurements of draco s absolute proper motion . the tangential velocity would in this case be about 120  and the ( galactocentric ) proper motion about 0.4  mas / a .",
    "the future astrometric satellite missions sim and gaia are expected to measure this motion with high accuracy so that firm constraints on draco s orbit and hence on the theoretical tidal boundary can then be obtained .",
    "this paper has focussed on analysing the properties of the draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy as a whole .",
    "apart from this the sdss data also enable us to investigate the stellar populations of draco ( i.e. , red giants , agb stars , subgiants , red and blue horizontal branch stars , and rr lyrae variables ) individually and to compare their distribution .",
