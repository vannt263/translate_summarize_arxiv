    "many important physical processes and chemical reactions involve nonadiabatic transitions between adiabatic electronic states , often mediated by conical intersections @xcite .",
    "an interesting example is the photoionization of ammonia ( nh@xmath0 ) and the nonadiabatic nuclear dynamics of the ammonia cation ( nh@xmath1 ) which for decades have been of great interest from the experimental as well the theoretical point of view , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "nonadiabatic electronic transitions are quantum phenomena and , in principle , should be studied by means of quantum mechanical methods .",
    "nonadiabatic effects can be investigated in detail for small systems with quantum mechanical methods . however , quantum calculations are costly or may be even impossible for the nonadiabatic nuclear dynamics of somewhat larger molecules . for these cases ,",
    "more approximate classical or semiclassical methods offer an important alternative because of their lower computational cost and the physical insight they provide into the dynamics of a reaction ; see the special issue dedicated to the nonadiabatic nuclear dynamics headed by the perspective @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are mixed quantum  classical approaches which treat the electronic motion quantum mechanically and the nuclear motion classically .    among the many quasi - classical methods for treating the nonadiabatic nuclear dynamics , e.g. , the semiclassical initial - value representation ( ivr ) @xcite , the ehrenfest dynamics method @xcite , the frozen gaussian wave - packet method @xcite , the multiple - spawning wave - packet method @xcite , to mention a few , the classical trajectory surface - hopping method with its many variants @xcite is one of the most widely used mixed quantum - classical computational methods .",
    "the key feature distinguishing different surface - hopping methods is the way of calculating nonadiabatic transition probabilities .",
    "the original fewest - switches approach @xcite solves the time - dependent schrdinger equation along classical trajectories in combination with the probabilistic fewest - switches algorithm at each integration time step to make a decision whether to switch the electronic state or not .",
    "this allows one to treat the nonadiabatic nuclear dynamics without determining nonadiabatic regions beforehand , but specify them along each treated classical trajectory .",
    "a widely used alternative is to use a nonadiabatic model , typically , the landau - zener ( lz ) model , for the calculation of nonadiabatic transition probabilities , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . in practical applications ,",
    "the challenge of using the landau - zener model is two - fold : ( i ) to find nonadiabatic regions where a hopping should take place , and ( ii ) to calculate a lz parameter and a lz nonadiabatic transition probability in each particular nonadiabatic region and for each particular classical trajectory .",
    "usually , the former requires beforehand analysis , while the latter needs a diabatization procedure , which is not uniquely defined , especially if the nonadiabatic coupling element is unknown .",
    "these problems can often make the practical application of the lz model difficult in multi - dimensional applications .",
    "both problems can be solved by means of the recently derived adiabatic - potential - based formula @xcite within the lz model .",
    "the center of a nonadiabatic region is determined by a local minimum of the separation of adiabatic potential energies along a classical trajectory , and the lz nonadiabatic transition probability in this region is calculated based on the time - dependent adiabatic energy gap , see below .",
    "no diabatization procedure is required .",
    "the adiabatic - potential - based formula @xcite derived within the lz model is somehow similar , but not identical , to a nonadiabatic transition probability formula obtained by an analytic continuation by @xcite .",
    "this lz surface hopping algorithm has very recently been tested for the two - dimensional two - mode model of a conical intersection @xcite and compared with other numerical algorithms and quantum dynamics calculations . in the present paper , this algorithm is applied to the nonadiabatic nuclear dynamics of the ammonia cation based on an accurate six - dimensional three - sheeted adiabatic potential energy surface ( pes ) @xcite which involves conical intersections of both jahn - teller and pseudo - jahn - teller types .",
    "photoelectron spectra of ammonia corresponding to the electronic ground state , as well as the two - fold degenerate excited state of the ammonia cation have been measured , see @xcite and references therein for experimental results .",
    "one of the interesting experimental findings is that nh@xmath2 fluorescence was not observed @xcite , supporting the idea of fast nonradiative decay processes due to a conical intersection @xcite .",
    "a pes based linear vibronic coupling model for the @xmath3 state and the first excited @xmath4 state @xcite was used to perform the first quantum wave packet calculation . in 2006 ,",
    "an analytical diabatic six - dimensional three - sheeted pes for the ground and two lowest - lying excited states of the ammonia cation was developed based on accurate ab initio multireference configuration interaction calculations .",
    "this model includes higher - order coupling terms both for the jahn - teller and pseudo - jahn - teller matrix elements .",
    "ultimately , six - dimensional wave packet dynamics calculations were performed employing the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree ( mctdh ) method were performed up to 100  fs @xcite .",
    "these dynamics calculations explained most experimental evidences , in particular the complex vibronic structure of the photoelectron spectra .",
    "nevertheless , there still exists an open question .",
    "it was found that about 30% of the @xmath5 state population did not decay to the @xmath6 state of the cation within 100  fs after photoionization .",
    "more accurate quantum dynamics calculations based on the same pess did not lower this fraction . on the contrary",
    ", the @xmath5-state population was found to be of 40% after 100  fs @xcite .",
    "therefore , a first principles theoretical study of the nonadiabatic nuclear dynamics of the ammonia cation is still of great interest .",
    "the surface hopping algorithm based on the adiabatic - potential - based formula @xcite is attractive for this purpose , since is well suited for a nonadiabatic dynamics study of a multi - dimensional system which exhibits conical intersections between several electronic states .",
    "the given diabatic representation of the six - dimensional three - sheeted ammonia - cation pes @xcite allows one to calculate three corresponding adiabatic pess , which are needed for the classical trajectory propagation and the adiabatic - potential - based formula for nonadiabatic transition probabilities , with minimal computational cost .",
    "moreover the classical trajectory surface hopping results can be compared with converged quantum dynamics calculations @xcite on the same pess .",
    "this provides a stringent test of the accuracy of the classical trajectory surface hopping approach for a nontrivial polyatomic system . due to the lower computational cost ,",
    "the surface hopping calculations can cover a longer time scale and provide physical insight into the nonadiabatic dynamics beyond the first hundred femtoseconds .",
