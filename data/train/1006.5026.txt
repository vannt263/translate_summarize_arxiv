    "recently , as unified field theories , super string , m , and f theories are proposed and are powerfully studied .",
    "@xcite those unified field theories are hoped to clear the mysteries of the particle physics , in which it begins to be discussed with extra dimensions .",
    "@xcite the unified field theories need additional dimensions except four dimensions of space and time .",
    "although those extra dimensions are not well known yet , those are expected to be clear experimentally .",
    "there are also some proposals that extra dimensions have a possibility to include time - like dimensions .",
    "@xcite actually , in that assumption , some problems in theoretical physics disappear , but it also brings us a possibility of violating causality . on the other hand , in electromagnetic dynamics , complex space , time , and fields are also proposed , and which are not only useful to avoid numerical difficulties but also helpful to predict unknown physics .",
    "@xcite moreover , a possibility of the existence of scalar fields caused by broken lorentz condition begins to be discussed in both the electromagnetic dynamics and quantum gravity .",
    "@xcite    as above listed proposals , there are many possibilities of existences of incredible phenomena .",
    "the experiments , to know if those are correct or not , begin to be done in recently .",
    "therefore , it is important to know what will be happen and to prepare many those predictions .",
    "so , we propose a theory having a potential to help discussing about those phenomena .",
    "we first prepare two scalar fields ( v / m ) , @xmath0 which have electric and magnetic properties , respectively .",
    "so , we call those  electroscalar \" and  magnetoscalar \" fields . here",
    ", we note that , for the convenience , the unit of time @xmath1 ( s ) is changed to ( m ) by multiplying light speed @xmath2 ( m / s ) as following formula , @xmath3 then , we consider those scalar fields waves and local coordinates which move along those waves with constant speeds .",
    "hereafter , we call those waves and systems having the local coordinates the basic waves and local systems , respectively .",
    "we define those local time ( m ) , @xmath4 at certain positions in the local systems . at the positions ,",
    "the basic waves are described by @xmath5 as those local time increase , corresponding time coordinates in an observing system ( m ) , @xmath6 also change . on the other hand",
    ", the basic waves also advance in space coordinates in the observing system as following formulas ( m ) , @xmath7 here , we assume that the time in the observing system , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , have @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 components as same as space , @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    ". moreover , we allow those coordinates to have complex values . about definitions of operations in complex - vector space , see appendix [ sec_csdef ] .",
    "so , we assume the time and space have totally twelve dimensions ( six for time and six for space ) .    about these assumptions",
    ", we have to explain the process how we reached at there .",
    "in many try and errors including some references,@xcite real values bring us problems , which are divergence due to zero division , and so on .",
    "the divergence and discontinuity in basic equations defined in following paragraphs make no solutions for us .",
    "we believe that the nature is smooth and has no divergences and discontinuities .",
    "so , we tried to use complex values for only the scalar fields and it seemed to go well .",
    "however , we found that velocity vectors in space defined in following paragraphs can not avoid to have complex values in those components . therefore , we treat complex space , which is defined by the space including imaginary values in its coordinates .",
    "moreover , time also need complex value , because the basic equations have complex values . however , complex time in one dimension having complex value easily advances along circle orbits on complex plane .",
    "this is unphysical , because we are existing in the world with time advancing straight .",
    "therefore , we also treat complex time in three dimensions by the same way with complex space .    since we expect that those basic waves interact with each other like electromagnetic waves having both electric and magnetic characters , we assume that those waves keep the distance from each other . by considering those and to solve simple problems , we assume that the basic waves advance with the same velocities in both the space and time coordinates in observing system .",
    "this make it possible that those local systems have the same local time at the most nearest points to each other .",
    "therefore , those assumptions lead to following equations , @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 we call @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) velocity vectors in time ( space ) .",
    "we also call @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) unit - velocity vectors in time ( space ) .",
    "those directions are along the directions of the basic waves .",
    "the relation among local and observing systems becomes @xmath26 by substituting this relation for ( [ eq_bw ] ) , we find formulas of the basic waves in the observing system .",
    "moreover , if the local system move with the same velocity with the wave , then the wave does not move in the local system .",
    "this phenomena is equivalent with that the local time in ( [ eq_lo ] ) does not change",
    ". therefore , time advance by different speeds for different inertial systems , and which is described by special relativity .",
    "we define components of local - time derivatives of coordinates in the observing system , @xmath27 @xmath28 and those products with the scalar fields ( v / m ) , @xmath29 @xmath30    now , we assume two energy tensors ,    @xmath31    and @xmath32 and two stress tensors , @xmath33 and @xmath34    for also these assumptions , we have to explain the process how we got them .",
    "in many try and errors including some references,@xcite we easily lost solutions in the basic equations .",
    "that is mainly because of cancellations between left and right hand sides of the basic equations .",
    "we believe that the nature does not need what it does not need .",
    "therefore , we put complex terms into above matrices not to occur any cancellations .",
    "moreover , we also put terms to make matrices have high symmetry between space and time , because we believe that the nature prefers high symmetry .",
    "furthermore , we also put terms to make the basic equations satisfy maxwell equations in some conditions as explained in following sections .",
    "we note that there are still ambiguities in determining terms in these matrices .",
    "for example , changing all rotation parts as shown in following paragraphs has a possible to be assumed , but which does not make any differences in qualitative discussions .",
    "then , we construct the basic equations as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 means a gradation operator for time coordinate in the observing system . for @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    ", we only have to exchange ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) for ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) and change signs of rotation parts . to find solutions of the basic equations easily , we consider steady states . therefore , we assume @xmath44 which means that the basic waves have constant speeds in both local and observing systems . by using this relation ,",
    "the basic equations become simple as following equations , @xmath45    where @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 and , about detail operations in complex - vector space , see appendix [ sec_csapp ] . about corresponding equations for ( [ eq_be1b ] )",
    ", we only have to exchange ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) for ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) and change signs of rotation parts .",
    "we call @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) acceleration vectors in time ( space ) .",
    "we also call @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) acceleration - unit vectors in time ( space ) .",
    "we note that the acceleration - unit vector does not promise unit length , although the unit - velocity vector has always unit length .",
    "we also note that time and space are equivalent with each other in these basic equations , because exchanging ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) for ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) derives the same equations . since time and space are equivalent in this theory , there is a possibility of existing another world , where our time ( space ) works as their space ( time ) .      on the two basic waves , the most nearest points to each other",
    "are expected to exist in the same time in observing system , because those need to interact with each other .",
    "moreover , the waves are expected to advance with an constant speed in time coordinates like many waves in steady states in our world .",
    "therefore , we assume that the two local - time derivatives of time in observing system are equal to each other and those local - time derivatives are zero as following relations , @xmath60 then , we define charges ( v / m@xmath61 ) , currents ( v / m@xmath61 ) , and fields ( v / m ) as following formulas , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a gradation operator in the local systems , @xmath64 this is because that space coordinates in the local system , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , are scaled by the factor @xmath67 , and which explain that the wave velocity , @xmath68 , is the same between the local and observing systems , @xmath69 this phenomena is also shown in special relativity . to reduce difficulties of finding solutions , as the basic waves ,",
    "we assume @xmath70 since electromagnetic waves advance straight in real space , which is defined by the space having non - imaginary values in its coordinates , we consider that the basic waves advance in real space .",
    "so , both @xmath24 and @xmath25 have real values in those components as explained in the following formula , @xmath71 we also choose zero or @xmath72 for the phase difference between the two basic waves , and which is shown as the following relation , @xmath73 where @xmath74 therefore , in this case , we find following relations , @xmath75 which also lead to following relations , @xmath76 by using above definitions and relations , from the right hand sides of ( [ eq_be5a ] ) , ( [ eq_be5b ] ) , and the corresponding equations for ( [ eq_be1b ] ) , we get following formulas ,    @xmath77         -\\beta   \\xi^*\\left [ \\dot{e }   -\\nabla'\\times b^*+\\frac{1}{\\beta^2}j_\\mathrm{e }   \\right],\\label{eq_force1}\\\\    \\partial_\\nu \\sm^{1\\sim3,\\nu }      & = & -\\eta\\vec{u}\\left(\\rho_\\mathrm{m}^*-\\beta^2 \\nabla'\\cdot",

    "the relation , ( [ eq_uureal ] ) , means that the wave advance in real time , which is defined by the time having non - imaginary values in its coordinates . those relations leading to the terms in lorentz force and maxwell equations , ( [ eq_ceep ] ) , ( [ eq_phase ] ) , ( [ eq_beta1 ] ) , and ( [ eq_uureal ] ) , do not lose solutions , and which are expected to have electromagnetic waves near themselves as explained in following sections",
    "moreover , the equations @xmath81 mean the conditions giving solutions without forces in real space .",
    "on the other hand , in complex space , the waves are affected by other forces and can not advance straight as explained in following sections .",
    "let us go back ( [ eq_be5a ] ) and ( [ eq_be5b ] ) , and we consider that the basic waves advance in both real time and real space , which leads to the following relation , @xmath82 and ( [ eq_ceep ] ) .",
    "those relations mean that the unit - velocity vectors in both time and space , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , give real values in those components .",
    "we assume those conditions to find an solution of electromagnetic waves , because the electromagnetic waves advance straight in real space .",
    "moreover , we assume ( [ eq_sconst1 ] ) and ( [ eq_sconst2 ] ) again to reduce the difficulties of finding solutions .",

    "furthermore , we realistically assume again that the waves advance in real time straight with a constant speed as explained in ( [ eq_uconst1 ] ) and ( [ eq_uconst2 ] ) . to satisfy ( [ eq_beaa ] ) and the corresponding equation for ( [ eq_be1b ] ) , those assumptions lead to @xmath85 therefore ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) give real ( zero ) values on @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , respectively .     and",

    "the complex coordinates are strongly studied in both mathematics and physics.@xcite some of remarkable works successfully show the spectrum of excitated states in atoms by using the ccm.@xcite in the ccm , radial wave functions of solutions of the schrdinger equation are solved along the axis deviating from real axis and hamiltonian matrix and eigenvalues become non hermitian and complex values , respectively . from the deviations of the eigenvalues from real values ,",
