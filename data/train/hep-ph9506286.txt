    "more than 15 years ago , the pioneer studies on vector - boson pair production @xcite revealed a surprise : the angular distribution for @xmath0 develops a pronounced zero @xcite at @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the @xmath3 scattering angle with respect to the incident fermion ( @xmath4 ) direction in the center of mass ( c.m . ) frame , and @xmath5 the electric charge of fermion @xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ wgzero ] demonstrates this unusual angular distribution for @xmath7 processes , in which the zero occurs at @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite stated in the abstract that `` ... we can offer no explanation for this behavior '' .",
    "in fact , it is not difficult to see what is happening for some simple cases .",
    "take @xmath9 as an example .",
    "there are three feynman diagrams to contribute at the born level : a @xmath10-channel diagram with an amplitude proportional to @xmath11 , a @xmath12-channel diagram proportional to @xmath13 , and an @xmath14-channel diagram proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "notice the charge relation in the standard model @xmath17 , and the kinematical relation @xmath18 , one can easily cast the amplitude into the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes a reduced matrix element as a function of the fermion helicity @xmath21 , vector - boson polarization @xmath22 and the external momenta @xmath23 .",
    "we see immediately that this amplitude develops a zero at a special angle determined by eq .",
    "[ eq : zero ] .",
    "not long after this discovery , several groups @xcite further examined this interesting feature .",
    "it was found that in gauge theories , any tree - level 4-particle ( spin @xmath24 ) feynman amplitudes with one or more massless gauge particles can be factorized into two factors , one of which contains the dependence of internal quantum numbers ( such as charges ) and the other contains the dependence of spin and polarization indices @xcite .",
    "this factorization is a special case for a more general theorem @xcite , which states that _ for a tree - level @xmath25-particle ( spin @xmath24 ) amplitude with one photon , the amplitude develops a zero when the factor @xmath26 are equal for @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the charge and momentum for the @xmath30 particle , respectively , and @xmath31 the photon momentum .",
    "_ there is certainly a deeper explanation for this phenomena , having something to do with the relationship between the internal gauge symmetry and the space - time symmetry .",
    "one can find a very nice discussion in bob brown s talk at this conference @xcite , or from the classical papers on this subject @xcite . following the literature",
    ", we will call those zeros radiation amplitude zeros ( raz ) @xcite .    it should be noted , however , that    * not all of the raz occur in physical region  in fact , most of them do not .",
    "the above theorem can be translated into an intuitive necessary condition for raz to occur in physical region : _ along with a massless gauge boson , the other particles involved in the process must have the same sign of electric charges_. we will call this condition the `` same - sign rule '' . *",
    "although loop diagrams ( and bubbles ) do not significantly alter the nature of raz @xcite , higher order real emissions spoil the raz @xcite .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that one can regain the born - level kinematics by vetoing additional final state particles , thus recovering an `` approximate '' zero in practice .",
    "it is natural to ask what may happen in a theory with a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry , such as the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "it is conceivable that the radiation of a @xmath32-boson may have some similarity to that of a photon . for the case of @xmath33 ,",
    "the amplitude can be written as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are combinations of coupling factors @xmath37 with the left - handed neutral current couplings @xmath38 , and @xmath39 contain the spin dependent part and is roughly proportional to the product of the vector - boson wave functions @xmath40 .",
    "it is obvious that without the @xmath36-term , the helicity amplitudes would factorize . in this case",
    ", all amplitudes would simultaneously vanish for @xmath41 , analogous to the @xmath42 case in eq .",
    "[ factorwg ] .",
    "since @xmath36 is directly proportional to @xmath43 , one may naively expect full factorization when @xmath44 .",

    "this can be traced to the special energy - dependence of the polarization vectors for longitudinal vector bosons , @xmath48 . since the @xmath36-term in eq .",

    "this important observation implies that if we study the 0-jet exclusive process @xmath115",
    "+ 0-jet @xmath116 + 0-jet , namely , if we veto the extra jet(s ) from higher order qcd processes , we recover most of the feature in the born level and thus regain the sensitivity to study the anomalous couplings .",
    "it is noted that the raz for @xmath117 occur in the central region @xmath118 ( and @xmath119 averagely ) .",
    "therefore , deviations from the sm will largely happen in high transverse momentum @xmath120 ) region .",
    "this feature has been carefully examined in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "it is shown that , as a function of a cutoff on the photon transverse momenta @xmath121 , the ratio of integrated cross sections @xmath122 for @xmath123 process ( which has no raz ) and for @xmath42 process ( which has a raz ) is a clear indication of a zero behavior , as shown in fig .",
    "we see that in high @xmath124 region , the rate for @xmath42 process is significantly smaller than that of @xmath123 process .",
    "in contrast , the ratio versus a cutoff on a jet transverse momentum @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 production is flat over a large @xmath128 range . the advantage of looking at the cross section ratio versus @xmath121 is to have avoided the c.m .",
    "frame and @xmath81-axis ambiguities , while the price to pay is to lose the information about the exact raz location .",
    "some more interesting observation has been made recently in ref .",
    "recall the rapidity in the lab frame ( @xmath129 ) is a sum of that in c.m .",
    "frame @xmath130 and a term reflecting the c.m .",
    "frame motion @xmath131 where @xmath132 are the parton momentum fractions .",
    "if we take the rapidity difference between the photon and the @xmath56 , then the difference is invariant under the longitudinal boost .",
    "therefore , the rapidity correlation between @xmath56-@xmath99 in the c.m .",
    "frame is preserved in the lab frame @xmath133 we thus have a chance to avoid the frame ambiguity if we choose the variable in such a clever way .",
    "[ 2dcorrl ] demonstrates the rapidity correlation in the lab frame @xcite .",
    "we see an impressive `` valley '' for the rapidity correlation , given by @xmath134 . in order to implement this idea more realistically",
    ", we must use the final state momentum of @xmath135 , rather than that of @xmath56 .",
    "fortunately , based on helicity arguments , the charged lepton in @xmath42 process goes dominantly along the @xmath56 moving direction , so that @xmath56-@xmath99 rapidity correlation is largely preserved , @xmath136 one could directly study the rapidity difference , which would have the advantage for higher statistics than the double differential cross section .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ 1dcorrl ] .",
    "the curve for the pseudorapidity difference in the sm ( solid ) presents a clear dip at -0.3 .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite have also estimated the error bars for expected statistical uncertainties with an integrated luminosity of 22  pb@xmath137 .",
    "since the cdf / d0 collaborations have accumulated about 100 pb@xmath137 each ( at the time of writing ) , one can anticipate that an experimental study along this line may first observe the clear dip reflecting the raz .",
    "the effects from anomalous couplings are also demonstrated in the figure .",
    "finally , two remarks are in order .",
    "first , we have thus far concentrated on tevatron energies . at the lhc , due to the more severe problems regarding the @xmath81-axis definition and much larger qcd corrections to the born amplitudes , the conclusions in studying the raz seem rather pessimistic .",
    "secondly , we have not discussed much about the background issue .",
    "it turns out that if we could achieve a @xmath138 misidentification factor at a level of 10@xmath139 , the background may not be too severe @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the @xmath56-radiative decay , @xmath142 , also presents a raz .",
    "@xcite studied the process @xmath143 at the tevatron .",
    "this process develops a zero at the kinematical boundary @xmath144 in @xmath56-rest frame .",
    "it can be effectively separated from the @xmath42 associated production by imposing a transverse mass cut , @xmath145 gev ; and it also has larger statistics .",
    "however , the raz is less pronounced due to the single - zero behavior @xcite and the difficulty for @xmath56-rest frame reconstruction .",
    "it is therefore less sensitive to anomalous couplings .",
    "@xcite discussed the zero in the hadronic decay process @xmath146 . in this case , it is a double - zero as usual and the @xmath56-rest frame reconstruction may be relatively easier",
    ". however , the event identification may be difficult in hadron collider experiments ; and it will suffer from low statistics for @xmath147 with a radiative @xmath56 decay .",
    "as discussed earlier , the born amplitude for @xmath149 develops a zero at high energies @xcite at @xmath150 . following the proposal of studying the rapidity correlation analogous to @xmath151 for @xmath152 process in fig .",
    "[ 1dcorrl ] , one can examine the rapidity correlation @xcite via @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the charged lepton from @xmath56 decay .",
    "figure [ wzcorrl ] shows the differential cross section @xmath155 . there is a dip near 0.1 as predicted in the sm ( solid curve ) , although it will not be easy to convincingly establish the effect due to the less pronounced dip for this channel and limited number of @xmath156 events expected ( see the estimated statistical error bars in the figure for 10 fb@xmath137 luminosity ) . at the lhc energies ,",
    "the zero is further washed out due to larger qcd radiative corrections and the @xmath81-axis ambiguity .",
    "it is amusing to note @xcite that @xmath157 or @xmath158 collisions above the @xmath63 threshold would in principle provide a clean environment for event reconstruction .",
    "the location of the zero at @xmath159 is ideal for experimental studies of the @xmath160 final state , unlike the case for @xmath161 where the zero is located at the kinematical boundary ( @xmath162 ) resulting a single - zero .      certain single photon radiation processes in quark scattering , such as @xmath165 present a raz @xcite at @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the electric charges for initial state quarks and @xmath169 the photon scattering angle with respect to the incident quark .",
    "but some other processes such as @xmath170 do not .",
    "the cause for the difference is the `` same - sign rule '' , as stated earlier .",
    "the locations of the zeros are clearly sensitive to the fractional charges of the quarks @xcite , although there are no triple vector - boson self - interactions involved . however , after convoluting with the hadron structure functions , the raz becomes a dip . at low energies where the valence quarks dominate ,",
    "there is a good chance one could find the raz in these processes .",
    "our experimental colleagues may consider to re - examine the low energy data , such as that at cern isr @xmath89 collider ( @xmath171 30 - 60 gev ) , for this purpose . at higher energies , such as at the fermilab tevatron @xcite",
    ", the qcd multiple - jet processes would completely swamp the raz signal .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the processes @xmath172 @xcite by simply replacing one of the quarks by @xmath173 in processes [ qqqq1],[qqqq2 ] . once again , at low energies where the valence quarks dominate , it is possible to examine the dip resulted from the raz . at hera energies ,",
    "however , the raz effects in @xmath174 collisions seem to be largely washed out , while it is claimed to be more promising in @xmath175 collisions @xcite , again due to the argument of the `` same - sign rule '' .",
    "inclusion of more realistic experimental simulation may further worsen this situation .",
    "the raz is a general feature in gauge theories .",
    "there are in fact many more processes beyond the sm in which the raz occur .",
    "the raz theorem has been generalized to supersymmetric theories with massless gaugino emission @xcite and raz have been found in the exact supersymmetric limit for processes @xcite such as @xmath176 in this limit , the raz locate at the same places as those for the sm partners .",
    "the raz is also found in charged higgs boson production @xmath177 @xcite , although the small yukawa coupling of @xmath178 to light fermions would make this process unobservable .",
    "a more promising process is for the decay @xmath179",
    "@xcite if kinematically accessible .",
    "similarly , the raz effects in radiative decays of other charged scalar particles such as lepto - quarks are also studied @xcite .",
    "certain tree - level processes involving massless gauge bosons and charged particles present radiation amplitude zeros ( raz ) . with",
    "higher order radiative corrections and in a more realistic experimental environment , those zeros are always approximate or become dips . in the sm with a spontaneously broken gauge symmetry , @xmath63 final state develops approximate zeros at high energies .",
    "in general , the nature of those zeros is sensitive to the gauge couplings of vector bosons and that of fermions as well . studying these raz",
    "experimentally may thus provide probes to physics beyond the sm .",
    "progress has been made in studying the raz both theoretically and experimentally , _ e. g. _ @xmath180 and @xmath181 at fermilab tevatron energies .",
    "other processes such as @xmath163 at low energies , and @xmath182 at hera should be examined at a level with realistic experimental acceptance to draw further conclusion .",
    "it is clearly challenging to experimentally observe those `` approximate '' zeros .",
    "hopefully one day , we would be able not only to observe the raz , but also in so doing to find some hints on new physics in the vector - boson sector .",
