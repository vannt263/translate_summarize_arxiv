    "the ikkt matrix model , called also iib matrix model , was proposed @xcite as a candidate for a non - perturbative formulation of superstring theory .",

    "this means that the scaling of physical observables within the ten - dimensional model of graphs is expected to be given by that of the four - dimensional theory @xcite .",
