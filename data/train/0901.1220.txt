    "in a pioneering experiment @xcite b.l .  baron and r.  hofstadter measured mechanical oscillations in piezoelectric disks when penetrating high energy electron beams impinged on the disks .",
    "the authors outlined the possibility that cosmic ray events could excite mechanical vibrations in a metallic cylinder at its resonant frequency and that they could represent a background for experiments aimed at the detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "the gw resonant detector nautilus , a massive ( 2.3 t ) suspended cylinder made of an aluminum alloy ( al5056 ) that can be cooled down to the thermodynamic temperature of 0.1 k , has been equipped with a cosmic ray detector to study the interactions due to cosmic rays and to provide a veto against the induced events in the antenna .",
    "the results on the cosmic ray observations made by nautilus can be summarized as follows : 1 ) when the antenna was operated at a temperature @xmath1 , well below the transition temperature from normal - conducting ( @xmath2 ) to superconducting ( @xmath3 ) states of the material , the rate of high energy signals due to cosmic ray showers was larger than the expectations based on the model describing the underlying physical processes @xcite ; 2 ) there was no evidence of this feature when the antenna was operated at @xmath4 , well above the transition temperature @xcite . from one side",
    "the hypothesis that this behavior was linked to the conducting state of the antenna and on the other side the incomplete knowledge at very low temperature of the thermophysical and thermodynamic parameters needed by the model have motivated an experiment ( rap ) to measure the longitudinal oscillations of suspended cylindrical bars exposed to electron beam pulses of controlled energy and intensity .",
    "the experiment , performed at the beam test facility ( btf ) @xcite of the dafne @xmath5-factory complex in the infn frascati laboratory , has already obtained the following results : 1 ) the measurements over a wide temperature interval @xmath6 on a bar made of the same aluminum alloy as nautilus have confirmed with good precision the validity of the model @xcite ; 2 ) the measurements on a pure niobium bar operated in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 state have demonstrated that the oscillation amplitude of the bar induced by the interaction with the beam depends on the state of conduction of the material @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we report on the measurements made on the aluminum alloy bar above and below the temperature of transition between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 state .",
    "in particular , we present a description of the model ( section [ tam ] ) , a summary of the experimental setup ( section [ exset ] ) , the collected data and analysis ( section [ meas ] ) and the comparison between the data and the model ( section [ comp ] ) .",
    "a pressure pulse is generated in a suspended cylindrical bar in the @xmath2 state following the interactions of an elementary particle with the bulk .",
    "this sonic pulse , due to the local thermal expansion caused by the warming up , related to the energy lost by the particle crossing the material , determines the excitation of the vibrational modes of the bar . in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite an aluminum bar was exposed to a proton beam and the theoretical expectations were based on a model in which the `` amplitude of the fundamental longitudinal mode of oscillation '' , hereafter referred to as amplitude , is given by : @xmath7 for a beam hitting the center of the cylinder generatrix . in the previous relation @xmath8 , @xmath9 are respectively length , mass of the cylinder , @xmath10 is the total energy loss of the beam in the bar , @xmath11 is the linear thermal expansion coefficient and @xmath12 is the isochoric specific heat .",

    "the value of @xmath30 for the aluminum alloy bar used in the experiment is estimated by mc to be -0.04 .",
    "when the material is in the @xmath3 state , an additional sonic source could be due to the local @xmath3-@xmath2 transitions in zones centered around the interacting particle path @xcite .",

    "the application of the model for the expected value @xmath118 computation of the amplitude in the @xmath3 state requires the knowledge of 1 ) the thermophysical parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 of the material in order to evaluate @xmath121 for the @xmath2 state below @xmath50 and 2 ) the dependence of @xmath38 on @xmath103 and @xmath122 for calculating @xmath123 via @xmath38 and its derivatives @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",

    "the insertion of these values in relation ( [ xth ] ) gives @xmath151 in the same temperature interval as in the first scenario .",
    "as previousy , the error is determined only by propagating the errors on the quantities in the right side of relation ( [ xth ] ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainties introduced in the calculations of the expected values in both scenarios do not allow us to individuate the one that better agrees with the experimental data .",

    "@xcite : @xmath153 at @xmath154 in the first scenario and @xmath155 in the alternative scenario , where for the latter the large error is due to the uncertainty on @xmath156 at this temperature .",
    "finally , dissipative effects , which can be inherent in this alloy and due to the flux line motion with consequent entropy transport , could play a role in the amplitude observed values .",
    "a clue in this direction lies in the fact that amplitude is not linearly dependent on @xmath10 in the @xmath3 state at fixed @xmath103 .",
    "the measurements performed on an al5056 suspended bar , hit by an electron beam and operated at temperatures above and below @xmath50 , have shown that in the @xmath3 state , the amplitude of the fundamental mode of the bar is enhanced with respect to the @xmath2 state by a factor @xmath157 3.5 at @xmath63 .",
    "this factor is consistent with the observations made by nautilus on cosmic rays at @xmath1 .",
    "the amplitude change in the @xmath3 state , following an energetic particle interaction , is due to the superconducting properties of the material .",
    "the absolute value of the normalized amplitude is enhanced in the al alloy and reduced in nb .",
    "incomplete knowledge of the involved thermophysical and thermodynamic parameters does not allow a full assessment of the model describing the underlying physical process in the @xmath3 state .",
    "the effects due to cosmic ray interactions could be an important source of noise in future gw acoustic and interferometric detectors of improved sensitivities and a complete characterization of the thermo - acoustic effects in the test masses operated in the @xmath3 state should be performed by direct measurements of the type shown in this letter .",
