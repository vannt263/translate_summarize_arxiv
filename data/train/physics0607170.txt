    "electron - positron plasmas are believed to be an important ingredient of the early universe and in astrophysical objects such as pulsars , supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei , and in gamma - ray bursts @xcite . in such extreme environments ,",
    "the electron - positron pairs may be created by collisions between particles that are accelerated by electromagnetic and electrostatic waves and/or by gravitational forces . in pulsar environments , there is also a possibility of pair creation via high - energy curvature radiation photons that are triggered by charged particles streaming along the curved magnetic field @xcite , with a resulting collection of positrons at the polar caps of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "high - energy laser - plasma interactions and fusion devices on earth also constitute a source of electron - positron plasmas .",
    "experiments with petawatt lasers ( with intensities exceeding @xmath0 ) have demonstrated the production of mev electrons and evidence of positron production via electron collisions @xcite .",
    "positrons are also believed to be created in post - disruption plasmas in large tokamaks through collisions between mev electrons and thermal particles @xcite .",
    "various collective phenomena in electron - positron plasmas have been demonstrated in the laboratory , such as the creation of wake fields by ultra - relativistic positron beams @xcite and two - stream instabilities in streaming electron - positron plasmas @xcite .",
    "the natural saturation mechanism for a two - stream instability is particle trapping in which electrons and positrons are trapped in the electrostatic potential of the large - amplitude wave .",
    "theoretical and numerical studies have shown that solitary electron / positron holes can exist both in a non - relativistic pair plasma @xcite and in a relativistically hot electron - positron - ion plasma @xcite .",
    "intense electromagnetic radiation introduces a new nonlinearity in the electron - positron plasma via the relativistic mass increase of the plasma particles in the quivering electric field of the electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated theoretically that relativistic electromagnetic solitary waves can exist in a cold electron - positron plasma , if there is an inclusion of massive ions @xcite .",
    "several authors @xcite have also considered the nonlinear propagation of small amplitude electromagnetic waves and alfvn vortices in a strongly magnetized electron - positron plasma .    over recent years , the laser pulse intensity has been strongly increasing , and over the next five to ten years it is expected to reach focal intensities of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , the interaction between plasmas and intense laser pulses is currently of great interest @xcite .",
    "as laser intensities keep increasing , laboratory plasma experiments will experience the effects of the nonlinear quantum vacuum @xcite , such as pair creation and photon splitting .",
    "theoretical studies of nonlinear laser - plasma interactions mostly make the simplified assumption of a coherent , monochromatic wave propagation in plasmas .",
    "it is then relatively easy to derive analytic expressions for various instabilities ( e.g. relativistic raman forward and backward scattering instabilities and the modulational instability in an electron - ion plasma @xcite ) and the formation of envelope electromagnetic solitons @xcite .",
    "however , the assumption about a monochromatic wave is not always true , e.g. if the electromagnetic waves are excited via turbulent processes .",
    "then , we would have a distribution of waves with different wavelengths and frequencies that are only partially coherent .",
    "theories for photon acceleration of partially coherent waves have been developed in the framework of nonlinear optics @xcite and are based on the wigner s kinetic description @xcite .",
    "the latter has been used to investigate the nonlinear instability of random phased small amplitude electromagnetic waves in a nonlinear dispersive medium @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the nonlinear propagation of relativistically intense broadband laser pulses in an electron  positron plasma . in order to analyze the properties of such partially coherent laser pulses ,",
    "we perform a wigner analysis of the modified nonlinear schrdinger equation , and obtain a wave kinetic equation for the photon quasi - particles .",
    "the resulting kinetic equation is investigated both analytically and numerically .",
    "specifically , we present the modulational instability and the dynamics of partially coherent intense laser pulses .",
    "it is found that the partial coherence of the laser pulse yields a reduced growth rate for the modulational instability .",
    "the fully nonlinear evolution of the wave kinetic equation is investigated by means of numerical simulations .",
    "the latter show a complex dynamics of broadband laser pulses in that the laser envelope contracts and disperses in a quasi - periodic manner , somewhat similar to the fermi - pasta - ulam recurrence phenomenon encountered for the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "the present results should be useful for understanding the nonlinear propagation of broadband intense electromagnetic pulses through pair plasmas such as those in laser - plasma systems and in astrophysical settings .",
    "let us consider the nonlinear propagation of intense circularly polarized electromagnetic waves in pair plasmas without ions .",
    "accounting for the relativistic mass increase of the pairs and quasi - stationary density fluctuations driven by the relativistic ponderomotive force , shukla _ et al . _",

    "even though eq .",
    "( [ eq : nlse ] ) contains a saturation nonlinearity , halting of collapse could be obtained by spectral broadening techniques , well - known in inertial confinement fusion .",
    "moreover , in many applications of such an equation , for example astrophysical systems , the pulses can be partially coherent .",
    "thus , understanding the dynamics and stability of electromagnetic pulses taking incoherence effects into account may be important for practical purposes .",
    "a canonical way for analyzing effects of partial coherence is to use the so called wigner function , defined as the fourier transform of the two - point correlation function of the vector potential @xmath18 according to @xcite @xmath19 where the angular bracket denotes the ensemble average .",
    "the wigner function represents a generalized distribution function for quasi - particles , in this case photons . from the definition ( [ eq : wigner ] ) , one finds the relation @xmath20 where @xmath21 . applying the time derivative to the definition ( [ eq : wigner ] ) and using eq .",

    "the @xmath23-operator is defined in terms of its taylor expansion . keeping only the first term in the latter , which corresponds to the long wavelength limit",

    "we see that the effect of the spectral broadening is to reduce the growth rate according to @xmath44^{1/2 } .\\ ] ] we note that as @xmath43 , we retrieve the expression ( [ eq : coherent2 ] ) .",
    "a comparison between the coherent and incoherent modulational instability growth rates is presented in fig .  1 .",

    "( [ eq:1dfintensity ] ) . as an initial condition for the simulation , we take the fourier transformed lorentz distribution ( [ eq : lorentz ] ) @xmath74 and the same parameters as in fig .  1 . in figs .  2 and 3",
    ", we use @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 as initial conditions . a small amplitude noise ( random numbers of order @xmath78 ) is added to the initial condition to give a seed for the modulational instability .",

    "the snap shots of the wigner distribution function , depicted in fig .  5 , shows the initial instability and merging of nonlinear structures corresponding to merging wave envelopes in fig .",
    "thus , a larger spectral width @xmath41 leads to a slower and less violent dynamics of the wave envelopes that also have larger scale sizes than for the smaller values of @xmath41 .",
    "we recall that the theoretical treatment predicts that there is a largest @xmath41 above which the modulational instability vanishes , and we would instead have damping of waves similar as landau damping for the vlasov equation .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the modulational instability and the nonlinear dynamics of partially coherent intense electromagnetic ( em ) waves in an electron - positron plasma , taking into account the relativistic mass increase of the pairs as well as large scale density fluctuations that are created by the relativistic ponderomotive force of em waves .",
    "the dynamics of broadband intense em waves is governed by a photon kinetic ( or the liouville ) equation .",
