    "the study of diboson physics at the tevatron allows us to probe gauge boson self - interactions that are a consequence of the non - abelian nature of the su(2)@xmath4 @xmath5 u(1)@xmath6 symmetry group .",
    "this is one of the least tested areas of the standard model .",
    "studies in this area provide a natural series of goals for detector sensitivity , probe fundamental details of the standard model electroweak sector directory and measurements at the tevatron explore higher energies than lep while providing access to some channels ( _ e.g. _ @xmath7 ) not available there . new physics",
    "would be reflected in increased cross sections beyond standard model expectations .",
    "diboson physics also form backgrounds to many other interesting physics channels like higgs , susy and ttbar , so understanding of the diboson physics can help studies at the lhc and tevatron .    in this proceedings , we present the results from four analyses .",
    "d is a multipurpose , hermetic detector .",
    "the interaction region is surrounded by a silicon microstrip detector and a fiber tracker within a 2  t superconducting solenoid magnet .",
    "there is a liquid argon - uranium calorimeter behind the magnet to measure the energy of most particles .",
    "the calorimeter is surrounded by three layers of muon detector , with a 1.8  t toroidal magnet after the first layer .",
    "it has pseudo - rapidity coverage of up to 3.2 for electrons and up to 2.0 for muons .",
    "the detector is completely described in the corresponding d nim article .",
    "the sm prediction for the total @xmath8 production cross section in @xmath9 collisions at the fermilab tevatron collider at @xmath10  tev is @xmath11  pb  @xcite .",
    "the requirement of leptonic @xmath12 boson decays ",
    "each @xmath12 boson decay to either electron or muon pairs , resulting in final states consisting of four electrons ( @xmath13 ) , four muons ( @xmath14 ) or two muons and two electrons ( @xmath15 )  reduces the observable cross section , making its measurement rather challenging .",
    "the accumulation of integrated luminosities in excess of 3 fb@xmath16 at the fermilab tevatron collider and the development of highly optimized event selection criteria has now made possible the direct observation of @xmath8 production using a data set of 1.7 fb@xmath16 .    for the @xmath13 channel , we require the measurement of four electrons with ordered transverse energies @xmath17 30 , 25 , 15 , and 15  gev , respectively , sorted by the number of electrons in the central detector in order to exploit differences in the qcd background , requiring at least two electrons in the central detector . for the @xmath14 channel , each measured muon must satisfy quality criteria based on scintillator and wire chamber information from the muon system , and have a matched track in the central tracker .",
    "we require that the four most energetic muons have ordered transverse momenta @xmath18 30 , 25 , 15 , and 15  gev , respectively .",
    "at least three muons in the event must be isolated . for the @xmath15 channel , the two most energetic electrons and muons in an event must have @xmath19 gev sorted by the number of electrons in the central detector . in all cases ,",
    "the leptons have to be consistent with coming from a pair of @xmath12 bosons with one having a dilepton mass greater than 70 gev and the other greater than 50 gev , with opposite - charge , like flavor lepton pairing .",
    "this selection provides for a clean signature with no other standard model background with four leptons .",
    "the small number of expected events means understanding of the background is important , the majority of which comes from @xmath20 + jets , where the jets are misreconstructed as leptons .",
    "this background is sensitive to the number of electrons in the central calorimeter .",
    "the predicted background is @xmath21 and the predicted signal is @xmath22 with 3 events observed in the data as shown in fig .",
    "[ zzfig ] .",
    "the likelihood of the background fluctuating to give the observed yield ( @xmath23-value ) is @xmath24 corresponding to a significance of @xmath25 .",
    "when this result is combined with an earlier @xmath8 analysis in the same channel and a @xmath26 , we get a significance of @xmath27 and measure a cross section of @xmath28  pb .",
    "@xcite this is in agreement with the theoretical expectation .",
    "the sm prediction for the @xmath1 production cross section in @xmath9 collisions with a tight transverse energy cut on the photon of 90 gev is @xmath29  pb @xcite .",
    "the measurement in this channel is performed with a data set of 3.6 fb@xmath16 .",
    "as stated , a single high @xmath30 photon is required in the central calorimeter and a large missing transverse energy of greater than 70 gev is also required to suppress multijet background .",
    "backgrounds are further reduced by rejecting events with jets having @xmath31 gev which contribute to mismeasured missing @xmath30 and the background from @xmath32 and @xmath33 is reduced by vetoing on muons , isolated tracks and additional electromagnetic objects with a transverse momentum greater than 15 gev .",
    "non - collision backround ( _ e.g. _ muon from halo or cosmics undergoing bremsstrahlung ) is handled using a pointing algorithm making use of the energy deposited in the calorimeter as well as measured tracks , where we assume the electromagnetic shower is initiated by photons , and require that the vertex pointed to by the energy is within 10 cm of the actual vertex , and that the distance of closest approach for the track is within 4 cm of the actual vertex .",
    "the predicted background is @xmath34 and the predicted signal is @xmath35 with 51 events observed in the data .",
    "the likelihood of the background fluctuating to give the observed yield ( @xmath23-value ) is @xmath36 corresponding to a significance of @xmath37 .",
    "we measure a cross section of @xmath38  fb .",
    "@xcite this is in agreement with the theoretical expectation .",
    "the sm prediction for the @xmath2 production cross section in @xmath9 collisions is @xmath39  pb @xcite .",
    "the measurement in this channel is performed with a data set of 1 fb@xmath16 .",
    "signal selection requires two leptons from the same vertex consisting of @xmath40 , @xmath41 or @xmath42 of opposite charge with at least one electron in the central calorimeter if appropriate and the leading lepton is required to have a transverse momentum of 25 gev while the other has 15 gev .",
    "backgrounds are reduced using various additional cuts .",
    "the background from @xmath33 is reduced via optimized missing @xmath30 for each channel , where the value is required to be greater than 44 gev for @xmath40 , 20 gev for @xmath41 or 35 gev for @xmath42 .",
    "this is further refined by an invarient mass requirement in the @xmath40 channel and azimuthal angle requirements in the other two channels . to reduce top and @xmath43+jets backgrounds , we require a balanceed event where @xmath44 ( the vector sum of the transverse momenta with the transverse missing energy ) is reqired to be less than 20 gev for @xmath40 , 25 gev for @xmath41 or 16 gev for @xmath42 .",
