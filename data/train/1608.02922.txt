    "the current investigation is motivated by the work of wegner @xcite and its continuation by schfer and wegner @xcite and oppermann and wegner @xcite on the motion of a quantum particle with many ( @xmath0 ) internal degrees of freedom in a disordered medium .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath1 of the quantum particle acts on a dense subset of @xmath2 , the space of square - integrable functions from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , via @xmath5 where the potential entries @xmath6 are @xmath7 hermitian matrices , and the hopping terms @xmath8 are @xmath7 matrices with the hermitian constraint @xmath9 .",
    "following @xcite , we take the potential entries and hopping terms random and assume them to be independent up to the hermitian constraint , meaning that @xmath10 are jointly independent .",
    "we assume that either the distribution of each @xmath6 is given by the goe , and that the matrices @xmath8 are real ( orthogonal case ) , or that the distribution of each @xmath6 is given by the gue ( unitary case ) . here , the probability density of the goe ( gaussian orthogonal ensemble ) with respect to the lebesgue measure on real symmetric matrices is proportional to @xmath11 , and the probability density of the gue ( gaussian unitary ensemble ) with respect to the lebesgue measure on hermitian matrices is proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "special cases of the model include the block anderson model and the wegner orbital model in their orthogonal and unitary versions , given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 has independent real gaussian @xmath15 entries , @xmath16 has independent complex gaussian @xmath17 entries , @xmath18 is a coupling constant , and superscripts indicate the symmetry class of the potential matrices .",
    "the block anderson model is a generalisation of the anderson model @xcite with gaussian disorder ( which is recovered when @xmath19 ) , whereas the wegner orbital model is invariant in distribution under local gauge transformations , i.e.  conjugation by @xmath20 of the form @xmath21    our results pertain to three topics : localisation at strong disorder in arbitrary dimension ( theorem  [ thm : loc ] ) , estimates on the density of states ( wegner estimates , theorem  [ thm : weg ] ) , and on the probabilities of multiple eigenvalues in a short interval ( minami estimates , theorem  [ thm : min ] ) .",
    "the latter two results are proved in greater generality , for deformed block - gaussian matrices , and are also applicable to gaussian band matrices .",
    "the common theme is the strive for the sharp dependence on the number @xmath22 of orbitals ( internal degrees of freedom ) . as an additional application",

    "so far only the localisation side of the transition has been established mathematically .",
    "two methods of proof are now available : the multi - scale analysis of frhlich and spencer @xcite and the fractional moment method of aizenman and molchanov @xcite .    a phase transition similar to that of the anderson model is conjectured to occur , in dimension @xmath27 , for the orbital models , with the threshold @xmath28 depending on the dimension and the number of orbitals .",
    "the first subject of the current paper is the dependence of the threshold @xmath28 on the number of orbitals @xmath22 . on the physical level of rigour",
    ", this question was settled already in the original papers @xcite .",
    "the arguments provided there indicate that , for @xmath27 , @xmath29 two heuristic arguments are discussed in section  [ s : rmks ] .",

    ", it asserts that , for @xmath30 below the threshold ( [ eq : conj ] ) , the matrix elements of the resolvent decay exponentially in the distance from the diagonal .",
    "the formal statement is in terms of finite - volume restrictions : denote by @xmath31 the coordinate projection to a finite volume @xmath32 and , for an operator @xmath1 of the form , let @xmath33 be the restriction of @xmath1 to @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the graph distance between @xmath36 , let @xmath37 be the @xmath38 norm of a vector @xmath39 and let @xmath40 be the operator norm of a matrix @xmath41 .",

    "is implied by @xmath54 ( where the constant may differ from that of ( [ eq : belthr ] ) ) .",
    "methods have been developed to pass from decay estimates for the resolvent in finite volume to other signatures of anderson localisation , in particular , pure point spectrum and dynamical localisation in infinite volume .",

    "localisation for @xmath56 follows from the general theorems pertaining to variants of the anderson model ( proved either by the method of @xcite , or of @xcite ) and does not require the additional arguments of the current paper .",
    "the asymptotics for growing @xmath57 in ( [ eq : thr ] ) is the same as in the corresponding result for the usual anderson model ; moreover , a heuristic analysis of resonances suggests that @xmath58 is the true order of growth of the threshold ( cf .",

    "the original estimate ( [ eq : fweg ] ) can be applied to the finite - volume restrictions of the models ( [ eq : def ] ) , where it provides the sharp dependence on the volume and on the size of the interval , but not on the number of orbitals .",
    "we prove a form of ( [ eq : fweg ] ) tailored to the models ( [ eq : def ] ) , with the sharp dependence on @xmath22 .",
    "we formulate the result in a more general form , which applies also to gaussian band matrices .    for positive integers @xmath64 , we consider a random square matrix of dimension @xmath65 which has the form @xmath66 in which @xmath67 is deterministic and the matrices @xmath68 are random and independent , with @xmath69 of size @xmath70 .",
