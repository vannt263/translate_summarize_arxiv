    "even though the presence of dark matter has been firmly established in recent years , the nature of the dark matter particle remains an outstanding problem in particle physics .",
    "the idea that the dark matter particle may perhaps be detected indirectly via the detection of potential annihilation products is promising .",
    "one particularly interesting aspect of indirect demodulation is the detection of @xmath0-rays from dark matter annihilations because it will be readily tested with the _ gamma - ray large area telescope _ ( glast ) in the next few years .",
    "the presence of sub  solar mass subhalos ( microhalos ) in the milky way can be probed by searching for the proper motion of @xmath0-rays emitted from dark matter annihilations @xcite .",
    "such a detection is of profound importance .",
    "first and foremost , it will be a detection of dark matter .",
    "in addition , it will provide information on the survival rate of microhalos in the solar neighborhood , and will place bounds on the mass of the dark matter particle , its annihilation cross section and its kinetic decoupling temperature @xcite .",
    "in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , the first bound structures form at high redshifts .",
    "the minimum mass is set by the rms dark matter particle velocities dictated at kinetic decoupling at a temperature @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for the particular case of supersymmetric ( susy ) dark matter , this scale is @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the abundance of microhalos in the solar neighborhood is still under debate @xcite . as such",
    ", it can be paremetrized by assuming that a certain fraction of the local dark matter density ( @xmath3 ) is in microhalos in a logarithmic mass interval @xcite , @xmath4 in this parameterization , @xmath5 takes the maximum value of @xmath6 when all of the local dark matter density is in objects in the logarithmic interval @xmath7 .",
    "we can get an estimate on the range of values it may take by considering the subhalo mass function of dark matter halos .",
    "the subhalo mass function has been studied in numerical simulations and found to be described by @xmath8 , normalized in a way such that for a milky way size halo , 10% of the mass of the halo is in subhalos of mass greater than @xmath9 .",
    "preliminary results from n - body simulations @xcite , as well as approximate analytical arguments find that this mass function is preserved down to microhalo scales , with the exception that on sub  solar mass scales the survival probability is reduced to only @xmath10$]% due to early rapid merging processes as well as potential interactions with stars @xcite . in this case",

    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in order to detect the proper motion of microhalos that may be present in the solar neighborhood , it is necessary to survey the whole sky in the @xmath0-ray part of the spectrum .",
    "this is where glast is ideal in performing a search for the proper motion of nearby microhalos .",
    "glast will survey the whole sky with an integral sensitivity of @xmath26 for photons with energy above a few gev .",
    "assuming an effective area of @xmath27 , and an exposure time of 10 years ( assuming the sky will be exposed uniformly for @xmath28 seconds per year based on the orbit configuration of the spacecraft @xcite ) , the sensitivity threshold for glast is @xmath29 photons .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the number of photons expected from microhalos as a function of distance for the same effective area and exposure time as mentioned above . for this particular example",
    ", the mass of the dark matter particle was assumed to be @xmath30 , with an annihilation cross - section of @xmath31 .",
    "this particular choice of parameters represents an optimistic scenario for supersymmetric dark matter . the shaded area in fig .",
    "1 shows the radius of the volume needed in order to enclose at least 1 microhalo for different values of the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the lower limit comes from assuming that @xmath32 , while the upper bound corresponds to @xmath33 . as can be gleaned from fig .",
    "1 , within reasonable distance ( e.g. within the shaded area ) , the number of photons on earth in a 10 year exposure is between 100 - 1000 for microhalos with masses @xmath34 .",
    "this number is well above the sensitivity threshold for glast , suggesting that glast will be able to perform a search for microhalos in the solar neighborhood .",
    "if the fraction of the local dark matter density in microhalos of mass less than @xmath35 is more than 0.2% , then there should be at least one microhalo potentially detectable with glast at a high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the dot - dashed lines show the distance where the maximum proper motion is greater or equal to 1 & 9 arcminutes .",
    "the single photon angular resolution of glast is better than @xmath36 arcminutes for photons of energy above few gev .",
    "however , the localization of a source which emits @xmath37 photons is improved by a factor of @xmath38 , thus placing a proper motion threshold of detection of @xmath39 .",
    "the solid line shows the threshold at which microhalos will be resolved as extended objects in glast ( assuming a psf of 9 arcminutes ) . in this case , the prospects for proper motion detection are much better because the excess photon flux from adjacent resolution bins in extended objects could be used to better localize the position of the source @xcite .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the number of microhalos per logarithmic mass interval that will be detectable based on the integral sensitivity of glast as a function of microhalo mass and the particle physics properties of the dark matter particle . here , @xmath40 , and the quantity @xmath41 is left as a free parameter ( where @xmath42 de $ ] ) .",
    "the particular case of an optimistic choice of parameters for supersymmetric dark matter is shown with the dashed line .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the quantity @xmath43 can attain higher values than the optimistic case of supersymmetry , e.g. kaluza  klein dark matter @xcite .",
    "the solid lines represent iso - number contours of the number of microhalos detected that will also exhibit proper motion greater than @xmath17 .",
    "such a detection can place constraints on the properties of the dark matter particle .",
    "more specifically , the detection of at least 1 microhalo with proper motion places a bound on the mass of the lightest supersymmetric particle to be less than 600 gev , and its kinetic decoupling temperature to be @xmath44 { \\rm mev}$ ] ( see @xcite for more details on the range of values of @xmath1 for supersymmetric dark matter ) .",
    "the potential detection of microhalos in the solar neighborhood has profound consequences in our understanding of the nature of the dark matter particle .",
    "it is therefore essential that glast includes a search for proper motion of @xmath0-rays in the data analysis .",
    "such an analysis can benefit significantly if the lifetime of glast is maximized , thus increasing the baseline for proper motion detection ."
