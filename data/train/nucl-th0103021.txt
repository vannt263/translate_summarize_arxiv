    "the microscopic study of atomic nuclei has gained in the recent years a noticeable level of reliability , following the improved knowledge of the interaction between the nucleons and the development of new and more sophisticated many  body theories .",
    "it is now possible to exactly solve the schrdinger equation for nuclei containing up to @xmath2 nucleons@xcite , while the structure of medium and heavy nuclei can be to a large extent understood by means either of variational techniques@xcite or of highly refined perturbative expansions@xcite .",
    "these relatively recent developments have clearly stressed several inadequacies of the independent particle model ( ipm ) , on which the time honoured shell model is based .",
    "for instance , the ipm completely fails in describing the large energy behaviour of the one nucleon momentum distribution and the quenching of the spectroscopic factors@xcite .",
    "the scenario is not equally bright for hypernuclei , or bound systems of nucleons and one or more strange baryons , as the @xmath3 or @xmath4 hyperons .",
    "body techniques developed for the nuclei can be , in most of the cases , straightforwardly extended to the hypernuclei , at least from a formal point of view .",
    "however , the weak point of a consistent microscopic approach now lies in the poorer understanding of the hyperon ",
    "nucleon ( yn ) and hyperon  hyperon ( yy ) interactions with respect to the nuclear case .",
    "the limited amount of information on the yn scattering data is a consequence of the experimental difficulties due to the short lifetime of the hyperons and to the low intensity of the beam fluxes .",
    "for this reason phenomenological models and effective yn interactions have been often used in the study of hypernuclei .",
    "approaches based upon skyrme interactions @xcite and woods ",
    "saxon @xcite potentials as well as relativistic mean field theories @xcite have been used . however ,",
    "also microscopic yn potentials have been recently produced @xcite and adopted to study the structure of hypernuclei from @xmath5o to @xmath6pb @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 single  particle properties have been investigated in details in ref .",
    "@xcite , making use of the nuclear matter fermi hypernetted chain results in a local density approximation .    in this paper",
    "we present a microscopic study of the structure of various hypernuclei containing a single @xmath3 hyperon .",
    "this study has been done by extending the correlated basis functions theory and the fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) equations technique @xcite to describe nucleonic systems containing one hyperonic impurity .",
    "the nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) interaction we have chosen is the semi - realistic two ",
    "nucleon s3 potential of afnan and tang @xcite , as modified in ref.@xcite . in the present work we neglect the three ",
    "nucleon potential . for the @xmath0nucleon ( @xmath0n )",
    "potential we have chosen that proposed by bodmer and usmani @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the effects of many - body forces involving the @xmath0 by explicitly considering a @xmath7 interaction or , alternatively , by including a density dependence in the bare @xmath8 force .",
    "the interactions generate strong nn and @xmath0n correlations , beyond those described by a mean field approach . in our work",
    "the correlation effects are accounted for by a jastrow correlated wave function , where the two  body correlations depend on the interparticle distances only .",
    "more realistic hamiltonians demand for a strong spin and isospin dependence in the correlation factor .",
    "however , we consider the simple jastrow ansatz as a first step towards a more complete description of the hypernuclei . the same strategy has been followed for doubly closed shell nuclei , where the accuracy of the variational method has now reached the same level as in nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "the fhnc equations for a @xmath0 embedded in infinite nuclear matter were developed in ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "doubly closed shell nuclei in @xmath9coupling were studied by fhnc and jastrow  type correlations , while the @xmath1coupling was introduced in such a scheme in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was so possible to study nuclei ranging from @xmath10c to @xmath11pb within the correlated basis function theory , using cluster expansion at all orders and avoiding such shortcuts as low order cluster truncations and local density approximations .",
    "the results obtained in those papers are the basis of the present fhnc study of @xmath3hypernuclei .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : section [ hami ] is devoted to a brief description of the hamiltonian and of the correlated wave function ; section [ dens ] gives an outline of the fhnc theory for the hypernucleus ; in section [ vari ] the expressions for the variational energy are presented and discussed ; the results are given in section [ resu ] and the conclusions are drawn in section [ conc ] .",
    "the system under study is a hypernucleus composed by @xmath12 nucleons and one @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "the formalism we have developed is however general enough to describe any nuclear systems containing a non - nucleonic particle , treated as an impurity in the nucleonic fluid .",
    "we write the hamiltonian of the system as : @xmath13 where we have considered two and three  body interactions between the hyperon and the nucleons and only two  body ones between the nucleons . in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] )",
    "the purely nucleonic part , @xmath14 , has been separated from that involving the @xmath0 , @xmath15 .",
    "the separation will be useful in the remainder of the paper .    as already stated in the introduction , we use the modified nn s3 potential , which is fixed to reproduce",
    "the @xmath16 wave scattering nucleon - nucleon phase shifts at low energies , gives reasonable results both for light nuclei and nuclear matter and allows for utilizing only central two  body correlations between the nucleons .",
    "the operatorial structure of s3 is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "modern nucleon - nucleon potentials are more complicated and contain the essential tensor terms , absent in s3 .",
    "on the other hand , we are mainly interested in presenting and testing the formalism .",
    "adopting the s3 potential is sufficient for this purpose and has the advantage of avoiding the technical complications deriving from the use of more realistic potentials .    within the same philosophy",
    ", we have chosen the @xmath0nucleon potential proposed by bodmer and usmani @xcite .",
    "this potential has central , spin and space ",

    "the tensor contribution , however , results to be zero if simple central correlations are adopted . as a consequence , such a semi - microscopic @xmath35 interaction is too repulsive in a jastrow correlated model , as we shall discuss later .",
    "for this reason , we simulate the effects of three and more ",

    "the binding energy of the @xmath0 particle is defined as minus the difference between the energies of the nuclear systems with and without the @xmath0 : @xmath41 where we have used the notation : @xmath42 with @xmath43 or @xmath12 . in the previous equations we have averaged on the third component of the @xmath0 total angular momentum and we have explicitly singled out the difference between the center of mass energies of the two systems .    our approach is based upon the variational principle ,",
    "therefore the energy functionals given in eq.([blambda ] ) , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , should be independently minimized with respect to variations of the many - body wavefunctions , @xmath46 .",
    "the hypernucleus wavefunction is chosen as : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the mean - field single particle wavefunction of the @xmath0 in @xmath1coupling , @xmath49 is a two - body scalar ( jastrow ) correlation between the hyperon and a single nucleon and @xmath50 is the correlated wave function describing the remaining @xmath12 nucleons . in our calculation",
    "this function is defined as : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the slater determinant of a set of single particle wave functions of @xmath53 neutrons and @xmath54 protons .",
    "obviously , @xmath55 .",
    "the energy expectation values are evaluated by means of the fermi hypernetted chain@xcite cluster diagrams resummation technique .",
    "as already mentioned , our approach consists in considering the @xmath0 as an impurity in the nucleonic fluid .",

    ", we extend the fhnc equations developed in ref.@xcite for doubly closed shell nuclei in the @xmath1coupling scheme with a jastrow correlated wave functions .",
    "the basic quantities to be analyzed are the one- and two - body densities ( obd and tbd ) .",
    "it is convenient to define densities for each type of particle , protons @xmath58 , neutrons @xmath59 and @xmath0 : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the projector operator over the particle of @xmath63 type .",
    "an averaged sum on the third components of the @xmath0 particle angular momentum is understood . as in refs.@xcite the densities",
    "are evaluated by using cluster expansion techniques .",
    "the nucleonic obd are divided in two parts : @xmath64 the first part is given by the sum of the cluster diagrams containing only nucleons , and represents the nuclear bulk contribution to the obd .",
    "one of the diagrams contributing to this part is the @xmath12 diagram of fig.[fig : diag ] .",
    "the second part of eq .",
    "[ ro1l ] , called rearrangement term , is obtained by summing all the diagrams containing the @xmath0 as an internal particle , like the diagram @xmath65 of fig.[fig : diag ] , and provides the modification of the nucleon obd due to the presence of the @xmath3 impurity .",
    "a mean - field description of the hypernucleus does not provide any rearrangement term .",
    "finally , the diagrams where the @xmath0 is an external particle , like the @xmath66 diagram of fig.[fig : diag ] , are summed in the -obd , @xmath67 .",
    "the separation of the one - body densities in bulk , rearrangement and @xmath0 terms will be very useful for the calculation of the @xmath0 binding energy in the nucleus and it will be exploited also for the calculation of other quantities occurring in the fhnc scheme .    in analogy with",
    "the one  body densities , we define the two  body densities as : @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is one of the operators defined in eq.([vn ] ) . the @xmath0n two  body densities are defined as : @xmath71 where @xmath72 are the operators of the @xmath0n interaction ( [ vl ] ) , and @xmath24 is the space exchange operator between the @xmath0 and the k - nucleon .    in the fhnc approach the tbd are described in terms of two - body correlation functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and of uncorrelated densities .",

    "@xcite , and they are obtained with the substitution @xmath92 . in extending the expressions given in the reference , we should remember that there is no sum on @xmath0 , since it is just a single external impurity , and that we consider the same correlation function between @xmath0 and any type of nucleon : @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "eq.([r=0 ] ) shows that , in our case , the spin component of the two - body density , @xmath95 , is zero .",
    "the reason lies in the fact that only diagrams corresponding to exchanges between identical particles contribute to the spin component of the two  body density for jastrow correlated wave functions . as a consequence",
    "they do not affect the @xmath0n  tbd .",
    "direct diagrams , where the particles are not exchanged , may contribute to @xmath95 only if the correlation contains spin dependent components ( which is not our case ) .",
    "moreover , this type of contribution has been found to be generally small @xcite .",

    "in this section we discuss the evaluation of the variational energy of a @xmath0 hypernucleus in the framework of the fhnc approach .",
    "the potential energy is separated into its nucleonic and @xmath0 pieces : @xmath103 the expectation values can be expressed in terms of the two  body distribution functions as : @xmath104 where @xmath105 indicates the average on the third components of the @xmath0 angular momentum and @xmath106 is the bulk nucleonic potential energy .    because the minimizations of @xmath44 and @xmath107 must be , in principle , carried on independently , the nucleon  nucleon jastrow correlation , @xmath108 , might be different in the two cases , as well as the nucleon single particle wave functions , @xmath109 .",
    "however , we found that in our cases @xmath108 and @xmath109 do not practically change in going from the @xmath12 to the @xmath110 system .",
    "as a consequence , in our approach the nucleonic part of the hypernucleus wave function has been kept the same as in nucleus .",
    "this fact allows for obtaining the potential energy contribution to the binding energy of the @xmath3 by subtracting the pure nucleus @xmath111 from @xmath112 .",

    "the introduction of a ddp , fitted to the @xmath3 binding in nuclear matter , brings @xmath34 reasonably close to the empirical estimate , even with a relatively simple correlation .",

    "we explicitly show the overall interaction and rearrangement contributions .",
    "the difference of the center of mass kinetic energies has been included in the rearrangement part .",
    "the increase of the @xmath0 binding energy along a is mostly produced by the interaction energy and , specifically , by its potential energy part .",
    "in contrast , the dependence of the rearrangement energy on @xmath12 is much weaker .",

    "the figure gives the @xmath0 energies in the @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 states .",
    "the quality of the agreement with the experiment is rather good , in spite of the simplicity of the model . by inspecting the figure in more details",
    ", we find that all the calculations underbind the @xmath0 in carbon by @xmath171 , and provide a steeper variation of @xmath34 with respect to the experiments .",
    "this behavior resembles that already described in carbon nucleus .",
    "it is also worth noticing that , as expected , the heavier nuclei , zr and pb , are better described by the woods - saxon well than by the ho one .",
    "the effects of the @xmath0n correlations on the one  body densities are shown in fig.[fig : dnuc ] , where the proton densities in four nuclei are compared .",
    "the dotted lines are the ipm densities , the dashed lines are the densities obtained in a purely nucleonic fhnc calculations , and , finally , the full curves represent the proton densities obtained when a @xmath0 hyperon is added in the @xmath16 wave to the doubly magic nucleonic core . in general , correlation effects are more important in oxygen and calcium than in the other two nuclei .",
    "moreover , the presence of the @xmath0 does not heavily modify the nucleonic densities .",
    "this is better shown in fig.[fig : core ] , where the differences between proton ( panel @xmath172 ) and neutron ( panel @xmath173 ) densities with and without the @xmath0 are given .",
    "the differences shown in the figure have been amplified by a factor 1000 .",
    "the heavier nuclei seem to be much more stable against deformations produced by the presence of the @xmath0 .",
    "this picture might change when the @xmath0 is inserted in the nucleonic core by substituting the last bound neutron .",
    "the differences , multiplied by 1000 , between the nucleonic densities of the isotopic hypernuclei with a+1 and a hadrons are given in fig.[fig : iso ] .",
    "the panels show the differences between the protons ( upper ) and neutron ( lower ) densities .",
    "the conservation of the charge and mass numbers for each hypernucleus implies that the curves in the upper panel are normalized to zero , while those in the lower panel are normalized to one .",
    "the analysis of this figure indicates that the nucleonic part is more perturbed if the @xmath0 substitutes a neutron having a low angular momentum , like in o , ca , and pb . in zr",
    "the neutron modified into a @xmath0 is lying on the @xmath174 level ( @xmath86=5 ) , and its wave function is peaked at the surface of the nucleus , as shown in panel @xmath175 of fig.[fig : iso ] . in any case ,",
    "heavy nuclei have again densities more rigid against deformations induced by the hyperon .",
    "the @xmath0 densities in @xmath5o , @xmath128ca , @xmath130zr and @xmath131pb for @xmath16 and @xmath58 waves are shown in fig.[fig : dlam ] .",

    "results very similar have been obtained for the @xmath133o , @xmath134ca , @xmath136zr and @xmath6pb hypernuclei .",

    "in this work we have studied some properties of hypernuclei containing one @xmath3 hyperon in the framework of the correlated basis functions theory . the @xmath3 binding energies in the @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath176 states , its density and the rearrangement part of the one  nucleon densities have been computed for hypernuclei whose nucleonic core has a doubly closed shell structure in @xmath1 coupling .",
    "the hyperon has been either added to the core ( @xmath127c , @xmath5o , @xmath128ca , @xmath129ca , @xmath130zr and @xmath131pb ) or substituted to a neutron in its highest shell ( @xmath132c , @xmath133o , @xmath134ca , @xmath135ca , @xmath136zr and @xmath6pb ) .",
    "the correlated wave function contains gaussian , jastrow correlations for the nn and @xmath0n pairs .",
    "the correlations act on a hypernuclear shell model wave function generated @xmath177 by a harmonic oscillator or woods  saxon mean field for the nucleonic part and @xmath178 by a harmonic oscillator well for the @xmath3 single particle potential .",
    "cluster expansion and fermi hypernetted chain resummation technique have been used .",
    "the energy of the system has been minimized with respect to variations on the parameters of the wave function .",
    "we have employed semirealistic hamiltonians with the s3 two  nucleon potential of afnan and tang , the bodmer and usmani @xmath3n potential and either a model of @xmath3nn three  particle interaction , still proposed by bodmer and usmani , or a density dependent modification of the @xmath3n force , in order to take into account many  hadron interactions .    using the @xmath0nn potential with jastrow correlations",
    "severely underestimates the @xmath0 binding energy , since the important , attractive tensor component of the two  pion exchange potential does not contribute in this model .",
    "in contrast , the density dependent modification of the @xmath0n potential , fitted to the @xmath0 binding in nuclear matter , provides results for the @xmath0 binding energy in nuclei in encouraging agreement with the experimental data .",
    "in fact , the disagreement is less than 10@xmath179 in all hypernuclei , for both @xmath16 and @xmath58 @xmath0 states .",
    "the only exception is provided by the carbon hypernuclei , showing a discrepancy with the experiments of @xmath18030@xmath179 that could be ascribed to the inefficiency of a spherically symmetric description of these systems .",
    "moreover , our analysis stresses the importance of adopting a good independent particle wave function as a starting point .",
    "in fact , the woods  saxon nucleonic mean field , fitted to the experimental one  nucleon densities , gives a better description of the @xmath0 binding than the harmonic oscillator model , especially in the heavy hypernuclei .",
    "the nucleonic core polarization effects due to the presence of the hyperon are more important in the lighter hypernuclei than in the heavier ones , both for the energy and for the one  nucleon densities .",
    "the rearrangement contributions to the @xmath0 binding energy go from @xmath181 in c to @xmath182 in pb and nuclear matter .",
    "as far as the @xmath0density is concerned , the influence of the correlations is much more visible in o and ca than in the heavier zr and pb .",
    "the results shown in this paper have been obtained by means of relatively simple hamiltonians , which entitle to use equally simple wave functions .",
    "however , hyperon  nucleon interactions may now be built on more microscopic grounds .",
    "it is to be expected that an effective use of these hamiltonians will ask for a more sophisticated correlation , with a strong dependence on the relative state of the correlated pair .",
    "the situation closely resembles that in doubly closed shell nuclei and in nuclear matter , where the introduction of modern potentials has prompted the extension of the correlated basis functions and fhnc theories in that direction .",
    "another interesting field of application of this technology is the study of hypernuclei with two or more hyperons , especially in view of a better determination of the hyperon  hyperon interaction .",
    "this work has been partially supported by murst through the _ progetto di ricerca di interesse nazionale : fisica teorica del nucleo atomico e dei sistemi a molticorpi _ and by the spanish direccin general de ciencia y tecnologa under project pb98 - 1318 .",
    "in this appendix we collect the different contributions to the rearrangement part of the one and two  body densities , where one of the internal particles must be a @xmath3 hyperon . following this rule ,",
