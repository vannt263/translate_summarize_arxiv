    "since its inception , the relational model of data introduced by e. codd @xcite has been extensively studied by both computer scientists and database systems developers .",
    "the model has become the standard theoretical model of relational data and the formal foundation for relational database management systems .",
    "various reasons for the success and strong position of codd s model are analyzed in  @xcite , where the author emphasizes that the main virtues of the model like logical and physical data independence , declarative style of data retrieval ( database querying ) , access flexibility and data integrity are consequences of a close connection between the model and the first - order predicate logic .",
    "this paper is a continuation of our previous work  @xcite where we have introduced an extension of codd s model in which tuples are assigned ordinal ranks .",
    "the motivation for the model is that in many situations , it is natural to consider not only the exact matches of queries in which a tuple of values either _ does _ or _ does not _ match a query @xmath0 but also approximate matches where tuples match queries to degrees .",
    "the degrees of approximate matches can usually be described verbally using linguistic modifiers like `` not at all ( matches ) '' `` almost ( matches ) '' , `` more or less ( matches ) '' , `` fully ( matches ) '' , etc . from the user s point of view , each data table in our extended relational model consists of ( i ) an ordinary data table whose meaning is the same as in the codd s model and ( ii ) ranks assigned to all tuples in the original data table .",
    "this way , we come up with a notion of a ranked data table ( shortly , an rdt ) .",
    "the ranks in rdts are interpreted as `` goodness of match '' and the interpretation of rdts is the same as in the codd s model ",
    "they represent answers to queries which are , in addition , equipped with priorities expressed by the ranks . a user who looks at an answer to a query in our model is typically looking for the best match possible represented by a tuple or tuples in the resulting rdt with the highest ranks ( i.e. , highest priorities ) .    in order to have a suitable formalization of ranks and to perform operations with ranked data tables , we have to choose a suitable structure for ranks .",
    "since ranks are meant to be compared by users , the set @xmath1 of all considered ranks should be equipped with a partial order @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath3 should be a poset .",
    "moreover , it is convenient to postulate that @xmath3 is a complete lattice  @xcite , i.e. , for each subset @xmath4 , its least upper bound ( a supremum ) and greatest lower bound ( an infimum ) exist .",
    "this way , for any @xmath4 , one can take the least rank in @xmath1 which represents a higher priority ( a better match ) than all ranks from @xmath5 .",
    "such a rank is then the supremum of @xmath5 ( dually for the infimum ) .",
    "since @xmath3 is a complete lattice , it contains the least element denoted @xmath6 ( no match at all ) and the greatest element denoted @xmath7 ( full match ) .",
    "the set @xmath1 of all ranks should also be equipped with additional operations for aggregation of ranks .",
    "indeed , if tuple @xmath8 with rank @xmath9 is obtained as one of the results of subquery @xmath10 and the same @xmath8 with another rank @xmath11 is obtained from answers to subquery @xmath12 then we might want to express the rank to which @xmath8 matches a compound conjunctive query `` @xmath10 _ and _ @xmath12 '' .",
    "a natural way to do so is to take a suitable binary operation @xmath13 which acts as a conjunctor and take @xmath14 for the resulting rank .",
    "obviously , not every binary operation on @xmath1 represents a ( reasonable ) conjunctor , i.e. we may restrict the choices only to particular binary operations that make `` good conjunctors '' .",
    "there are various ways to impose such restrictions . in our model , we follow the approach of using residuated conjunctions that has proved to be useful in logics based on residuated lattices  @xcite .",
    "namely , we assume that @xmath15 is a commutative monoid ( i.e. , @xmath16 is associative , commutative , and neutral with respect to @xmath7 ) and there is a binary operation @xmath17 on @xmath1 such that for all @xmath18 : @xmath19 operations @xmath16 ( a multiplication ) and @xmath17 ( a residuum ) satisfying are called _ adjoint operations .",
    "_ altogether , the structure for ranks we use is a _",
    "complete residuated lattice _",
    "@xmath20 , i.e. , a complete lattice in which @xmath16 and @xmath17 are adjoint operations , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the operations of infimum and supremum , respectively . considering @xmath23 as a basic structure of ranks brings several benefits .",
    "first , in multiple - valued logics and in particular fuzzy logics  @xcite , residuated lattices are interpreted as structures of truth degrees and the relationship between @xmath16 ( a fuzzy conjunction ) and @xmath17 ( a fuzzy implication ) is derived from requirements on graded counterpart of the _ modus ponens _ deduction rule ( currently , there are many strong - complete logics based on residuated lattices ) .",
    "the graded counterpart of _ modus ponens _",
    "@xcite can be seen as a generalized deduction rule saying `` from @xmath24 valid ( at least ) to degree @xmath25 and @xmath26 valid ( at least ) to degre @xmath27 , infer @xmath28 valid ( at least ) to degree @xmath14 '' .",
    "if if - part of ensures that the rule is sound while the only - if part ensures that it is as powerful as possible , i.e. , @xmath14 is the highest degree to which we infer @xmath28 valid provided that @xmath24 valid at least to degree @xmath9 and @xmath26 valid at least to degre @xmath27 .",
    "this relationship between @xmath17 ( a truth function for logical connective imlication @xmath29 ) and @xmath16 has been discovered in  @xcite and later used , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , together with the lattice ordering ensure enough properties of @xmath17 and @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , @xmath17 is antitone in the first argument and is monotone in the second one , condition @xmath30 iff @xmath31 holds for all @xmath32 , @xmath33 equals @xmath34 for all @xmath18 , etc . since complete residuated lattices are in general weaker structures than boolean algebras , not all laws satisfied by truth functions of the classic conjunction and implication are preserved by all complete residuated lattices . for instance , neither @xmath35 ( idempotency of @xmath16 ) nor @xmath36 ( the law of double negation ) nor @xmath37 ( the law of the excluded middle ) hold in general .",
    "nevertheless , complete residuated lattices are strong enough to provide a formal framework for relational analysis and similarity - based reasoning as it has been shown by previous results .",
    "second , our extension of the codd s model results from the model by replacing the two - element boolean algebra , which is the classic structure of truth values , by a more general structure of truth values represented by a residuated lattice , i.e. we make the following shift in ( the semantics of ) the underlying logic :    _ two - element boolean algebra _",
    "@xmath38 _ a complete residuated lattice .",
    "_    third , the original codd s model is a special case of our model for @xmath23 being the two - element boolean algebra ( only two borderline ranks @xmath7 and @xmath6 are available ) . as a practical consequence ,",
    "data tables in the codd s model can be seen as rdts where all ranks are either equal to @xmath7 ( full match ) or @xmath6 ( no match ; tuples with @xmath6 rank are considered as not present in the result of a query ) .",
    "using residuated lattices as structures of truth degrees , we obtain a generalization of codd s model which is based on solid logical foundations and has desirable properties .",
    "in addition , its relationship to residuated first - order logics is the same as the relationship of the original codd s model to the classic first - order logic .",
    "the formalization we offer can further be used to provide insight into several isolated approaches that have been provided in the past , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and a comparison paper  @xcite .        ' '' ''    @xmath39 & & & & & & + @xmath40 & & & & & & + @xmath41 & & & & & & + @xmath42 & & & & & & + @xmath43 & & & & & & + @xmath43 & & & & & & + @xmath44 & & & & & & + @xmath45 & & & & & & +    a typical choice of @xmath23 is a structure with @xmath46 $ ] ( ranks are taken from the real unit interval ) , @xmath21 and @xmath22 being minimum and maximum , @xmath16 being a left - continuous ( or a continuous ) t - norm with the corresponding @xmath17 , see  @xcite .",
    "for example , an rdt with ranks coming from such @xmath23 is in table  [ tab : sales_a ] .",
    "it can be seen as a result of similarity - based query `` show all houses which are sold for ( approximately ) and have ( approximately ) square feet '' .",
    "the left - most column contains ranks .",
    "the remaining part of the table is a data table in the usual sense containing tuples of values . at this point",
    ", we do not explain in detail how the particular ranks in table  [ tab : sales_a ] have been obtained ( this will be outlined in further sections ) .",
    "one way is by executing a similarity - based query that uses additional information about similarity ( proximity ) of domain values which is also described using degrees from @xmath23 .",
    "note that the concept of a similarity - based query appears when human perception is involved in rating or comparing close values from domains where not only the exact equalities ( matches ) are interesting .",
    "for instance , a person searching in a database of houses is usually not interested in houses sold for a particular exact price .",
    "instead , the person wishes to look at houses sold approximately at that price , including those which are sold for other prices that are sufficiently close .",
    "while the ranks constitute a `` visible '' part of any rdt , the similarities are not a direct part of rdt and have to be specified for each domain independently .",
    "they can be seen as an additional ( background ) information about domains which is supplied by users of the database system .",
    "let us stress the meaning of ranks as priorities . as it is usual in fuzzy logics in narrow sense , their meaning is primarily _ comparative _ , cf .",
    "@xcite and the comments on comparative meaning of truth degrees therein . in our example , it means that tuple @xmath47 with rank @xmath40 is a better match than tuple @xmath48 whose rank @xmath41 is strictly smaller .",
    "thus , for end - users , the numerical values of ranks ( if @xmath1 is a unit interval ) are not so important , the important thing is the relative ordering of tuples given by the ranks .",
    "note that our model which provides theoretical foundations for similarity - based databases  @xcite should not be confused with models for probabilistic databases  @xcite which have recently been studied , e.g. in @xcite , see also  @xcite for a survey .",
    "in particular , numerical ranks used in our model ( if @xmath46 $ ] ) can not be interpreted as probabilities , confidence degrees of belief degrees as in case of probabilistic databases where ranks play such roles . in probabilistic databases , the tuples ( i.e. , the data itself ) are uncertain and the ranks express probabilities that tuples appear in data tables .",
    "consequently , a probabilistic database is formalized by a discrete probability space over the possible contents of the database  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the underlying logic of the models is the classical two - valued first - order logic  only yes / no matches are allowed ( with uncertain outcome ) . in our case , the situation is quite different . the data ( represented by tuples ) is absolutely certain but the tuples are allowed to match queries to degrees .",
    "this , translated in terms of logic , means that formulas ( encoding queries ) are allowed to be evaluated to truth degrees other than @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the underlying logic in our model is not the classic two - element boolean logic as we have argued hereinbefore .    in  @xcite , a report written by leading authorities in database systems",
    ", the authors say that the current database management systems have no facilities for either approximate data or imprecise queries . according to this report",
    ", the management of uncertainty and imprecision is one of the six currently most important research directions in database systems . nowadays , probabilistic databases ( dealing with approximate data )",
    "are extensively studied . on the contrary",
    ", it seems that similarity - based databases ( dealing with imprecise queries ) have not yet been paid full attention .",
    "this paper is a contribution to theoretical foundations of similarity - based databases .",
    "the issue we address in this paper is the following . in our model",
    ", we can get two or more rdts ( as results of queries ) which are not exactly the same but which are perceived ( by users ) as being similar . for instance",
    ", one can obtain two rdts containing the same tuples with numerical values of ranks that are almost the same .",
    "a question is whether such similar rdts , when used in subsequent queries , yield similar results . in this paper",
    ", we present a preliminary study of the phenomenon of similarity of rdts and its relationship to the similarity of query results obtained by applying queries to similar input data tables .",
    "we present basic notions and results providing formulas for computing estimations of similarity degrees .",
    "the observations we present provide a formal justification for the phenomenon discussed in the previous section ",
    "slight changes in ranks do not have a large impact on the results of ( complex ) queries .",
    "the results are obtained for any complete residuated lattice taken as the structure of ranks ( truth degrees ) .",
    "note that the basic query systems in our model are ( extensions of ) domain relational calculus  @xcite and relational algebra  @xcite .",
    "we formulate the results in terms of operations of the relational algebra but due to its equivalence with the domain relational calculus  @xcite , the results pertain to both the query systems .",
    "thus , based on the domain relational calculus , one may design a declarative query language preserving similarity in which execution of queries is based on transformations to expressions of relational algebra in a similar way as in the classic case  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : prelim ] presents a short survey of notions .",
    "section  [ sec : simil ] contains results on sensitivity analysis , an illustrative example , and a short outline of future research . because of the limited scope of the paper , proofs are sketched or omitted",
    "in this section , we recall basic notions of rdts and relational operations we need to provide insight into the sensitivity issues of rdts in section  [ sec : simil ] .",
    "details can be found in  @xcite . in the rest of the paper",
    ", @xmath23 always refers to a complete residuated lattice @xmath20 , see section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "given @xmath23 , we make use of the following notions : an @xmath23-set @xmath5 in universe @xmath49 is a map @xmath50 , @xmath51 being interpreted as `` the degree to which @xmath52 belongs to @xmath5 '' . if @xmath23 is the two - element boolean algebra , then @xmath50 is an indicator function of a classic subset of @xmath49 , @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) meaning that @xmath52 belongs ( does not belong ) to that subset . in our approach ,",
    "we tacitly identify sets with their indicator functions . in a similar way ,",
    "a binary @xmath23-relation @xmath55 on @xmath49 is a map @xmath56 , @xmath57 interpreted as `` the degree to which @xmath58 and @xmath59 are related according to @xmath55 '' .",
    "hence , @xmath55 is an @xmath23-set in universe @xmath60 .",
    "we denote by @xmath61 a set of _ attributes _ , any subset @xmath62 is called a _ relation scheme .",
    "_ for each attribute @xmath63 we consider its _",
    "domain @xmath64_. in addition , each @xmath64 is equipped with a binary @xmath23-relation @xmath65 on @xmath64 satisfying reflexivity ( @xmath66 ) and symmetry @xmath67 ( for all @xmath68 ) .",
    "each binary @xmath23-relation @xmath65 on @xmath64 satisfying ( i ) and ( ii ) shall be called a _ similarity . _",
    "pair @xmath69 is called a _",
    "domain with similarity .",
    "_    tuples contained in data tables will be considered as usual , i.e. , as elements of cartesian products of domains .",
    "recall that a cartesian product @xmath70 of an @xmath71-indexed system @xmath72 of sets @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is a set of all maps @xmath75 such that @xmath76 holds for each @xmath74 . under this notation ,",
    "a  _ tuple _ over @xmath62 is any element from @xmath77 .",
    "for brevity , @xmath77 is denoted by @xmath78 .",
    "following the example in table  [ tab : sales_a ] , tuple @xmath48 is a map @xmath79 for @xmath80 such that @xmath81 , @xmath82 , etc .    a _ ranked data table _ on @xmath62 over @xmath83 ( shortly , an rdt ) is any ( finite ) @xmath23-set @xmath84 in @xmath78 .",
    "the degree @xmath85 to which @xmath86 belongs to @xmath84 is called a _",

    "note that @xmath84 is an @xmath89-ary @xmath23-relation between domains @xmath64 ( @xmath63 ) since @xmath84 is a map from @xmath90 to @xmath1 . in our example , @xmath91 for @xmath86 being the tuple with @xmath82 .",
    "relational operations we consider in this paper are the following : for rdts @xmath92 and @xmath93 on @xmath94 , we put @xmath95 and @xmath96 for each @xmath97 ; @xmath98 and @xmath99 are called the _ union _ and the _ @xmath21-intersection _ of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "analogously , one can define an _ @xmath16-intersection _",
    "hence , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath16 are defined componentwise based on the operations of the complete residuated lattice @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , our model admits new operations that are trivial in the classic model .",
    "for instance , for @xmath25 , we introduce an _ @xmath9-shift @xmath103 _ of @xmath84 by @xmath104 for all @xmath97 .",
    "note that if @xmath23 is the two - element boolean algebra then @xmath9-shift is a trivial operation since @xmath105 and @xmath106 produces a possibly infinite table containing all tuples from @xmath107 . in our model",
    ", an @xmath9-shift has the following meaning : if @xmath84 is a result of query @xmath0 then @xmath108 is a `` degree to which @xmath8 matches query @xmath0 at least to degree @xmath9 '' .",
    "this follows from properties of residuum , see  @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath9-shifts allow us to emphasize results that match queries at least to a prescribed degree @xmath9 .",
    "the remaining relational operations we consider represent counterparts of projection , selection , and join in our model .",
    "if @xmath84 is an rdt on @xmath94 , the _ projection @xmath109 _ of @xmath84 onto @xmath110 is defined by @xmath111 for each @xmath79 . in our example , the result of @xmath112 is a ranked data table with single column such that @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 .",
    "a similarity - based selection is a counterpart to ordinary selection which selects from a data table all tuples which approximately match a given condition : let @xmath84 be an rdt on @xmath94 and let @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "then , a _ similarity - based selection @xmath118 _ of tuples in @xmath84 matching @xmath119 is defined by @xmath120 considering @xmath84 as a result of query @xmath0 , the rank of @xmath8 in @xmath118 can be interpreted as a degree to which `` @xmath8 matches the query @xmath0 and the @xmath121-value of @xmath8 is similar to @xmath122 '' . in particular ,",
    "an interesting case is @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are both attributes with a common domain with similarity .",
    "similarity - based joins are considered as derived operations based on cartrsian products and similarity - based selections . for @xmath79 and @xmath126 such that @xmath127 , we define a concatenation @xmath128 of tuples @xmath86 and @xmath129 so that @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132 for @xmath133 . for rdts @xmath92 and @xmath93 on disjoint relation schemes @xmath134 and @xmath94 we define a rdt @xmath135 on @xmath136 , called a _ cartesian product _ of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , by @xmath137 . using cartesian products and similarity - based selections , we can introduce _ similarity - based @xmath138-joins _ such as @xmath139 .",
    "various other types of similarity - based joins can be introduced in our model , see  @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the notion of similarity of rdts which is based on the idea that rdts @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( on the same relation scheme ) are similar iff for each tuple @xmath8 , ranks @xmath140 and @xmath141 are similar ( degrees from @xmath23 ) .",
    "similarity of ranks can be expressed by biresiduum @xmath142 ( a fuzzy equivalence  @xcite ) which is a derived operation of @xmath23 such that @xmath143 .",
    "since we are interested in similarity of @xmath140 and @xmath141 for all possible tuples @xmath8 , it is straightforward to define the similarity @xmath144 of @xmath92 and @xmath93 by an infimum which goes over all tuples : @xmath145 an alternative ( but equivalent ) way is the following : we first formalize a degree @xmath146 to which @xmath92 is included in @xmath93 .",

    "obviously , there may be various reasonable similarity relations defined for the above - mentioned domains and their careful choice is an important task . in this paper , we neither explain nor recommend particular ways to do so because ( i ) we try to keep a general view of the problem and ( ii ) similarities on domains are purpose and user dependent .    consider now the rdt in table  [ tab : sales_b ] defined over the same relation scheme as the rdt in table  [ tab : sales_a ] .",
    "these two rdts can be seen as two ( slightly different ) answers to the same query ( when e.g. , the domain similarities have been slightly changed ) or answers to a modified query ( e.g. , `` show all houses which are sold for ( approximately ) and  '' ) .",
    "the similarity of both the rdts given by is @xmath191 ( very high ) .",
    "the results in the previous section say that if we perform any ( arbitrarily complex ) query ( using the relational operations we consider in this paper ) with table  [ tab : sales_b ] instead of table  [ tab : sales_a ] , the results will be similar at least to degree @xmath191 .

    "intuitively , one would expect to have a high degree of similarity of the rdts because they differ only by a slight change in price .",
    "this issue can be solved by considering the following tuple - based degree of inclusion : @xmath208 where @xmath209 is a similarity of tuples @xmath8 and @xmath210 over @xmath94 , cf .",

    ", @xmath217 on the other hand , similarity - based selection @xmath218 ( and , as a consequence , similarity - based join @xmath219 ) does not preserve @xmath212 in general which can be seen as a technical complication .",
    "this issue can be overcome by introducing a new type of selection @xmath220 which is _ compatible _ with @xmath212 .",
    "namely , we can define @xmath221 for this notion , we can prove that @xmath222 .",
    "similar extension can be done for any relational operation which does not preserve @xmath212 directly .",
    "detailed description of the extension is postponed to a full version of the paper because of the limited scope .      in this section",
    ", we outline a general approach to similarity of rdts that includes both the approaches from the previous sections .",
    "interestingly , both and have a common generalization using truth - stressing hedges  @xcite .",
    "truth - stressing hedges represent unary operations on complete residuated lattices ( denoted by @xmath223 ) that serve as interpretations of logical connectives like `` very true '' , see  @xcite .",
    "two boundary cases of hedges are ( i ) identity , i.e. @xmath224 ( @xmath25 ) ; ( ii ) globalization : @xmath225 , and @xmath226 if @xmath227 .",
    "the globalization  @xcite is a hedge which can be interpreted as `` fully true '' .",
    "let @xmath228 be truth - stressing hedge on @xmath23 . for rdts @xmath229 on @xmath94",
    ", we define the degree @xmath230 of inclusion of @xmath92 in @xmath93 ( with respect to @xmath228 ) by @xmath231 now , it is easily seen that for @xmath232 being the identity , coincides with ; if @xmath233 is separating ( i.e. , @xmath234 iff @xmath235 is identical to @xmath236 ) and @xmath232 is the globalization , coincides with .",
    "thus , both and are particular instances of resulting by a choice of the hedge . note that identity and globalization are two borderline cases of hedges .",
    "in general , complete residuated lattices admit other nontrivial hedges that can be used in .",
    "therefore , the hedge in   serves as a parameter that has an influence on how much emphasis we put on the fact that two tuples are similar . in case of globalization",
    ", we put full emphasis , i.e. , the tuples are required to be equal to degree @xmath7 ( exactly the same if @xmath233 is separating ) .",
    "if we consider properties needed to prove analogous estimation formulas for general @xmath237 as we did in case of @xmath134 and @xmath212 , we come up with the following important property : @xmath238 for every @xmath239 which can be seen as transitivity of @xmath233 with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath228 .",
    "consider the following two cases in which is satisfied :    * @xmath232 is globalization and @xmath233 is separating . if the left hand side of is nonzero , then @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",

    "* @xmath233 is transitive . in this case , since @xmath244 ( follows from properties of hedges by standard arguments ) , transitivity of @xmath233 and monotony of @xmath228 yield @xmath245 .",
    "the following lemma shows that @xmath246 and consequently @xmath247 have properties that are considered natural for ( degrees of ) inclusion and similarity :    if @xmath233 satisfies with respect to @xmath228 then    the assertion follows from results in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.2 ) by taking into account that @xmath248 is reflexive , symmetric , and transitive with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "we have shown that an important fragment of relational operation in similarity - based databases preserves various types of similarity . as a result ,",
    "similarity of query results based on these relational operations can be estimated based on similarity of input data tables before the queries are executed .",
