    "for our scheme , using a large enough sample size is important when tracking the polarization state , because the statistical fluctuation of the samples will weaken the reference tracking ability .",

    "<S> calibration of the polarization basis between the transmitter and receiver is an important task in quantum key distribution ( qkd ) . </S>",

    "<S> photons are natural resources to carry quantum information , which can be transferred through fiber or free space channels . </S>",
    "<S> fiber is the most widely used quantum channel profiting from its extensibility , while its birefringence has disturbed experimental researchers for many years . </S>",
    "<S> the birefringence of the fiber makes qkd systems vulnerable to environmental disturbance and significantly affects the performance of qkd systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the polarization reference frames of a transmitter alice and a receiver bob will be misaligned in polarization encoding qkd systems , which will directly increase the quantum bit error rate ( qber ) of the system@xcite . in phase encoding qkd systems </S>",
    "<S> , polarization fluctuation will reduce the fringe visibility and consequentially increase the qber of the systems.@xcite . due to its adverse effects </S>",
    "<S> , effective polarization compensation schemes should be performed in qkd systems .    </S>",
    "<S> some passive self - compensation methods have been developed for phase encoding qkd systems , such as the `` plug - and - play '' @xcite and `` faraday - michelson '' @xcite structures , while active feedback tracking is still a major methods used in polarization encoding qkd systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> depending on whether it halts the quantum photon transmitting procedure , most of these strategies can be divided into two types , the interrupting scheme @xcite and the real - time scheme @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the former will apparently sacrifice the efficiency of the system . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is primarily based on the time - division multiplexing ( tdm ) and the wavelength - division multiplexing ( wdm ) methods . </S>",
    "<S> the tdm methods send the reference signals in the time intervals between quantum photons , which may not be compatible with up - to - date high - speed qkd systems . </S>",
    "<S> the wdm methods send reference signals with the wavelength distinct from the quantum signals , thus may limit the security transmission distance of qkd due to the polarization decorrelation between the two signals @xcite . because most of these schemes need extra components such as photodetectors or laserdiodes , the qkd system will be more complicated and will need to be carefully designed to protect the quantum photons from the `` pollution '' of the relatively strong reference light .    in this paper , we propose a real - time continuous polarization - basis tracking scheme for qkd based on single photon detection signals . </S>",
    "<S> we use the sifted key bits unveiled and discarded during the post processing procedure of qkd , which are usually @xmath1 to @xmath2 of the total sifted key bits @xcite , to calculate the feedback control signals of a gradient algorithm that are applied to the polarization control ( pc ) components accordingly . because the scheme can be implemented without extra photon sources , detectors and time expenditures , the method can be used in some single photon level quantum optical experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we applied the scheme to the off - the - shelf electronic polarization controllers ( epcs ) in a typical polarization encoding qkd system to compensate for the polarization disturbance of a 50 km fiber channel . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization - basis tracking can be performed during the post - processing of qkd without interrupting the transmission of quantum signals . </S>",
    "<S> the average qber of the qkd system is 2.32@xmath0 and the standard derivation is 0.87@xmath0 during 24 hours of continuous operation , which effectively verified the validity of using this method in qkd .    </S>",
    "<S> the polarization - basis tracking method should be used in conjunction with specific polarization control components in qkd systems . </S>",
    "<S> the epcs based on fiber - squeezers @xcite are fundamental devices used in qkd system profiting from their low insertion loss . </S>",
    "<S> major drawbacks of this type of epcs are low modulating rates and inconsistency even when the same driving voltages are applied . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an optimizing algorithm should be developed to make them work efficiently . </S>",
    "<S> we selected the four - stage epcs ( polarite , general photonics , 5228 edison avenue chino , ca 91710 ) as the polarization control unit , which has an insertion loss as low as 0.05 db . </S>",
    "<S> the epc consists of four electronic fiber squeezers ( fss ) @xmath3,@xmath4,@xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the same as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage applied on one fs will rotate the state of polarization ( sop ) with an angle of @xmath7 around the axis @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) on the @xmath10 sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the rotation @xmath11 can be described by the hamilton s @xmath12@xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath7 is determined by the voltage @xmath14 on the fs@xmath15 , and @xmath8 represents the rotation axis on the @xmath10 sphere . </S>",
    "<S> the sop @xmath16 after rotating an input state @xmath17 with one squeezer can be represented by their normalized stokes vectors @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath20    in principle , any sop changing in the fiber channels can be compensated by driving the epc with proper voltages . </S>",
    "<S> three fss are sufficient to track all polarization states and the algorithm can be made more flexible with extra fss @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the driving voltages are adjusted according to the feedback signal @xmath21 , which is a function of the current values of the driving voltages @xmath14 and @xmath8 ( i=1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the directions of the fs s rotation axes change over time due to their mechanical structures and environmental disturbances . as a result , there are two challenges to implementing a real - time polarization tracking algorithm with this type of epcs : @xmath22 it is difficult to build a look - up table for each squeezer and @xmath8 must be measured each time before adjustment and , @xmath23 the algorithm works during quantum key transmission , which means it is unavailable to traverse all combinations of epc driving voltages . to overcome these disadvantages , we modified the widely used gradien algorithm according to the traits of epc and qkd systems . </S>",
    "<S> the flow chart of the algorithm can be described as in algorithm 1 .     </S>",

    "<S> the arrows @xmath26 represents the assignment operation , @xmath14 is the immediate driving voltage on the epc squeezer s axis @xmath8 ( @xmath27=1,2,3 and 4 ) , @xmath21 is the feedback value and @xmath28 is the threshold value of the deviation from the ideal situation in the qkd system . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath29 is a small dither value and @xmath30 is an amplification factor of the voltage adjustment . at the beginning of the algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , the four @xmath31 were initialized as the center value of the dynamic range of the driving voltage . </S>",
    "<S> because the rotation of @xmath8 is slowly varying , it can be regarded as a constant from step 6 to step 11 within a cycle of the algorithm . to estimate the reference value of @xmath8 , </S>",
    "<S> a tiny dither voltage @xmath29 is applied to the fs to lightly change @xmath32 in step 7 . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation values @xmath21 before and after fine - tuning are calculated and used to obtain the partial derivative @xmath33@xcite , which shows the relationship between @xmath34 and @xmath14 , in other words , the direction of @xmath8 at this moment . in step 9 , we modify @xmath14 according to the partial derivation @xmath33 , and @xmath29 is subtracted so that @xmath8 can return back to its original position . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath30 is used to tune the step size and is negative to minimize @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the four @xmath14 ( i=1,2,3 and 4 ) are adjusted one by one as described in step 10 until @xmath21 is lower than the threshold @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the four driving voltages of the fss are kept until @xmath21 exceeds @xmath28 again .    </S>",
    "<S> the crux of this algorithm is how to accurately calculate the feedback signal @xmath21 with single photon signals . in the polarization </S>",
    "<S> encoding bb84 protocol , alice randomly modulates the polarization of photons to horizontal states @xmath35 , vertical states @xmath36 , @xmath37 states @xmath38 , and @xmath39 states @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the four states are combined to make two conjugate bases , which are usually named the @xmath41 basis ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 basis ( @xmath38 and @xmath40 ) . </S>",
    "<S> bob randomly selects one of the two bases to measure the photons . </S>",
    "<S> the tracking scheme for the two basis is identical , so that we use the @xmath41 basis to illustrate the estimation method of @xmath21 . comparing the states </S>",
    "<S> sent by alice and detected by bob , we can obtain an mm @xmath45 , which can be depicted as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) denote the probabilities that bob gets @xmath35 and @xmath36 when alice sends @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , respectively.nomalization requires that , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for matrix @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , when alice sends a @xmath42 state photon , bob will obtain a deterministic result of @xmath42 when he measures the photon with the @xmath41 basis . </S>",
    "<S> it is similar for the other three states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a reference matrix ( rm ) in the ideal situation should be an identity matrix @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a practical qkd system will suffers from the environmental disturbance and its intrinsic noise . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the measurement matrix ( mm ) of single photon detection results will deviate from the rm . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the distance of @xmath45 and @xmath53 during quantum key transmission will be highly related to the rotation degree of alice and bob s polarization reference frame and can be used to calculate the feedback signal @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the method we used to calculate the distance between rm and mm is described in the following equation .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54    the sample size required to perform the algorithm is an important parameter , because more samples means a longer acquisition time , which will weaken the tracking capability . </S>",
    "<S> the final purpose of polarization - basis tracking is to minimize the qber , which is defined as the ratio between the wrong and the total detection results when alice and bob select the same basis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the qber into three parts as follows : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is caused by the reference frame mismatch between alice and bob , which we need to compensate during the qkd procedure , @xmath57 is caused by the intrinsic imperfections of the qkd system , such as the modulating errors and the dark counts of the single photon detectors ( spd ) which is approximately 1@xmath0 to 1.5@xmath0 in an typical system below . </S>",
