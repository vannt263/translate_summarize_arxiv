    "the non axis - symmetric logarithmic potential plays an important role in galaxy dynamics . in the three - dimensional space ,",
    "the potential :    @xmath3    ( where @xmath4 are the usual cylindrical coordinates @xmath5 @xmath6 ) models an elliptical galaxy with a dense core of radius @xmath7 and with the additional property of having a flat rotation curve at large radii @xcite . in the 2d space ,",
    "the logarithmic potential can describe other non axis - symmetric components of galaxies , such as bars in the centers of galaxy disks .",
    "the study of the orbital structure of the logarithmic potential was initially motivated by the need to construct self - consistent models of galaxies@xcite .",
    "numerical experiments have proven to be very useful in revealing the rich orbital structure of this potential , including the major orbit families , the resonances and the stochastic orbits .",
    "for example , in the axis - symmetric case ( @xmath8 ) , the logarithmic potential has been shown to admit only loop orbits , which are regular and avoid the origin .",
    "the non axis - symmetric ( @xmath9 ) potential admits two major families of orbits : box ( for @xmath10 and loop orbits ( for @xmath11 ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "note that this behavior can be also be retrieved from the two simple analytical approximations of the potential , one as a sum of two oscillators very close to the origin and the other one as @xmath12 at large distances @xcite .",
    "an interesting change in the orbital behavior has been discovered when the potential becomes singular . in their numerical study , miralda - escud @xmath13 schwarzschild @xcite have found that as @xmath14 , a larger fraction of regular box orbits becomes irregular or `` box - like '' ( i.e. they will admit fewer integrals of motion than the number of spatial dimensions ) , with the end result that , in the limit @xmath15 all box orbits are irregular .",
    "the general interpretation of this result is that the scattering by the singularity renders the box orbits unstable , a similar behavior to that observed in systems which contain a central black hole @xcite .",
    "in addition , the singular logarithmic potential admits several families of minor orbits , _",
    "i.e. , _ resonances in terms of the @xmath16:@xmath17 frequency ratio : the banana ( 2:1 ) , fish ( 3:2 ) and pretzel ( 4:3 ) orbits @xcite .",
    "numerical studies have also revealed the existence of some stochastic orbits in a narrow region near the singularity ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this has led some to suggest a link between the scattering by the singularity and the transition to chaos @xcite , although no rigorous proof has been given to date in support of this hypothesis .",
    "the present investigation is an analytical approach to the study of the orbital dynamics ( including the behavior near the singularity ) in the case of the singular logarithmic potential :    @xmath18    in both the axis - symmetric and non axis - symmetric cases .",
    "the aim of our work is not only to complement the previous numerical studies performed on this subject , but also to offer a theoretical basis for interpreting their results .",
    "the main difficulty in investigating the system analytically is due to the presence of the singularity in the origin , which creates a discontinuity in the equations of motion .",
    "this problem motivates the introduction of a change of coordinates that regularizes the equations of motion . for this , we resort to mcgehee - type transformations @xcite , a technique that is frequently used in celestial mechanics for the study of singularities in the n - body problem @xmath19 the underlying idea behind this technique is to transform the equations of motions and the time , such that the singularity is `` blown - up '' into a non - trivial manifold ( in our case a torus ) . by studying the characteristics of the flow on this manifold",
    ", one can extrapolate the information ( by continuity with respect to the initial data ) about the orbital dynamics around the singularity @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sections 2 and 3 provide a brief description of our system , in terms of the equations of motion and the conservation of energy . in section 4 , we remove the singularity by regularizing the equations of motion . in section 5 , we provide a description of the collision manifold and the zero velocity manifold , two abstract surfaces on which we can visualize the properties of the flow close to the singularity and at the maximum distance from the source allowed for a given energy , respectively .",
    "section 6 presents the complete global dynamics in the axis - symmetric case ( @xmath20 ) . in section 7",
    ", we extend the analysis for the case of the non axis - symmetric potential ( @xmath21 ) , in the restricted limit in which the anysotropy is small . in this case , we prove theoretically that the majority of orbits in this case are centrophobic ( that is , they avoid the origin ) @xmath22 a result that has been originally discovered in the numerical study of miralda - escud @xmath13 schwarzschild @xcite @xmath22 and we discuss the orbital structure in terms of orbits which preserve or change the sign of their angular momentum .",
    "finally , in section 8 , we show how several families of resonances can be retrieved through the numerical integration of the new system of equations .",
    "the non axis - symmetric logarithmic problem is a one - parameter hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom .",
    "the anisotropic logarithmic singular potential ( [ log1 ] ) determines a conservative system with a preserved hamiltonian given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 are the generalized coordinates and @xmath25 are the momenta .",
    "we start by writing the equations of motion in a form that contains the anisotropy in the kinetic term rather than in the potential .",
    "thus , we substitute @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 introducing the ( standard ) notations for the generalized vector coordinate @xmath30 the generalized momenta @xmath31 , the anisotropy parameter @xmath32 and the mass matrix @xmath33 the hamiltonian writes :    @xmath34    and the anisotropic logarithmic problem is given as the first order system of ordinary differential equations :    @xmath35    when @xmath36 the above system describes the motion in the axis - symmetric logarithmic potential .",
    "from the point of view of hamiltonian mechanics this case is completely integrable , as we have the two integrals of motion given by the conservation of the total energy and the total angular momentum .",
    "however , we point out that for @xmath37 the dynamical behavior becomes unknown since the vector field @xmath38 ceases to exist .",
    "let k be the kinetic energy ,    @xmath39    and v the potential , @xmath40 the total energy @xmath41 is then :    @xmath42    since the system ( [ log4 ] ) is hamiltonian the total energy is conserved .",
    "that is @xmath43 is constant along the solution curves of ( [ log4 ] ) and consequently the level sets of @xmath43 are invariant under the flow .",
    "if @xmath44 is a certain energy constant ( i.e. @xmath45constant ) then the level set @xmath46 is a three - dimensional surface usually called an _ energy surface , _ which we denote @xmath47",
    "we want to consider in more detail the topology of various surfaces @xmath48 including the orbits near the singularity .",
    "let us fix @xmath49 using a technique similar to mcgehee s @xcite we introduce the change of variables :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is a point on the unit circle @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "our transformation is a diffeomorphism from @xmath55 to @xmath56 ( where @xmath53 is the unit circle ) and can be understood as a passing to some unorthodox kind of polar coordinates .",

    "more precisely , since the kinetic term in ( [ log6 ] ) is positive , we have that for a fixed level of energy @xmath44 :    @xmath60    solving the above relation , it follows that @xmath61 with @xmath62 in other words the motion is always bounded for any fixed level of energy @xmath63 also , we can say that the energy surface @xmath64 projects onto a disc of radius @xmath65 in @xmath66 since    @xmath67    it follows that along the @xmath68 boundary we have @xmath69 that is the kinetic term cancels .",
    "for this reason the curve @xmath70 is called the _ oval of zero velocity _ in @xmath47 in physical space , this curve represents the outmost boundary of the orbital structure allowed for a given energy .",
    "we will denote this curve by @xmath71    proposition 3.1 for any fixed level of energy @xmath44 the energy surface @xmath64 is diffeomorphic to an open solid torus ( i.e. a solid torus minus its boundary ) .",

    "we implement a change of the time variable through @xmath87 .",
    "this will have the effect of decreasing the rate of the time intervals near the singularity .",

    "however , the behavior of the orbits near the singularity can be extrapolated from similar properties of the flow on the collision manifold . in this sense , we regard the differential system of equations as a vector field on the manifold , its solutions representing the flow .    note that @xmath93 is independent of the total energy and therefore we can say that the time transformations we have applied have the effect of pasting an invariant boundary onto each @xmath47 over this boundary the vector field is given by @xmath94    the solid and now compact torus @xmath64 bounds all the orbits and by investigating its properties , one can obtain a global picture of the motion , including the motion near the singularity . we emphasize that the orbits of system  ( [ log4 ] ) are the same as the orbits of system  ( [ presystem ] ) , only the parametrization is different . therefore , any results concerning the solutions of the first system can be seen as results for the solutions of the second , as long as one is aware of the fact that the rate at which solutions move along the orbits is different .    using the energy integral we can further reduce the dimension of the system . for this",

    "these orbits , for which @xmath107 displays a sinusoidal - type behavior and admits four critical points , represent the family of loop orbits ( see also a similar result in the study of touma @xmath13 tremaine @xcite ) .    on the other hand ,",

    "more and more orbits will break away from the curves of equilibria @xmath285 and @xmath289 and become boxlet , a result which was also pointed out in @xcite .",

    "we do not present here a rigorous proof for the existence of the boxlet obits or the resonances , leaving it for a future study .",

    "the orbital structure can also be retrieved numerically , by integrating the general form of the system ( [ system ] ) . the return to the initial",
    "coordinates in the physical space , @xmath354 can then be made through the relations :    @xmath355    and recalling that the time scale was modified such that both the singularity and the zero velocity manifold are now reached in an infinite time .    by appropriately choosing the initial conditions and recalling that @xmath356 one can retrieve the resonance families .",
    "for example , we know that the family of loop orbits ( 1:1 ) develops around the two periodic orbits @xmath223 ( see figure 4 ) , _ i.e. _ near : @xmath357    and @xmath358    the two periodic orbits correspond to the two parent orbits of the loop family , one evolving clockwise ( @xmath359 ) , the other counter - clockwise ( @xmath195 ) . integrating the system ( [ system ] ) for the case @xmath360 , around either @xmath361 or @xmath362 one",
    "retrieves a circle of radius @xmath363 , as indicated with thick line in figure 9 .",
    "the same figure shows , with dotted line , the orbital structure in the vicinity of the parent orbit for the case when @xmath364 ( corresponding to @xmath365 ) .    besides the loop resonance",
    ", several other resonances can be recovered from the new system of differential equations .",
    "we remark that under large perturbations ( _ i.e. _ large deviations from axis - symmetry ) , the families of minor orbits will occupy more and more of the phase - space .",
    "we do not attempt here to cover the entire phase - space , but rather give a few examples of families of minor orbits found with our new system of equations .",
    "for example , figure 10 shows an example of an orbit around the fish ( 3:2 ) resonance , in the case @xmath366 ( corresponding to @xmath367 ) and the initial conditions @xmath368 @xmath369 and @xmath370 figure 11 shows an orbit around the pretzel ( 4:3 ) resonance , when @xmath364 and @xmath371 @xmath372 @xmath373 figure 12 shows an orbit near the ( 5:3 ) resonance , obtained for @xmath374 @xmath375 @xmath376 @xmath377 we note however , that these parameters should be taken only as a guidance for the location of the resonances .",
    "previous numerical studies have revealed several important aspects of the orbital structure of the logarithmic potential : the division between loop and box orbits , the presence of resonances , the scattering effect of the singularity ( which renders the box orbits unstable ) , and the transition to chaos .",
    "we have performed an analytical study of the singular logarithmic potential and proved several of these results .",
    "- in the axis - symmetric case , we retrieve the complete global dynamics of the orbits and describe it on a solid torus bounded by the two surfaces @xmath378 and @xmath379 .",
    "we find analytically the two periodic orbits @xmath223 , which correspond in physical space to the two parent families of the loop orbits ( in clockwise and respectively , in counter - clockwise motion ) .    -",
    "in the non axis - symmetric case , we prove that all orbits , except a negligible set , are centrophobic a result that has been originally discovered in the numerical study of miralda - escud @xmath13 schwarzschild @xcite .    - in the same non axis - symmetric case",
    ", we show that there exist orbits which preserve the sign of the angular momentum and retrieve the loop resonance .",
    "finally , we also show how several other minor family orbits can be obtained from the our new system of equations .",
    "the analytical description in general non axis - symmetric case remains still open , several problems requiring further investigation .",
    "one of them is the retrieval of the family of boxlet orbits , which are known to dominate the dynamics near the singularity @xcite .",
    "we conclude , however , that under large perturbations ( large deviations from axis - symmetry ) , most of the phase space is occupied by orbits that slip in between the stable manifold of @xmath285 and the unstable manifold of @xmath250 and wind around indefinitely .",
    "most of these orbits pertain to the family of the boxlet orbits . some of these winding orbits may be closed and would lie at the origin of the resonant families observed experimentally .",
    "further work in this direction will have to include an in - depth analysis of resonances in the @xmath380 variables and a fourier expansion of the periodic solutions for @xmath381    another aspect that remains to be clarified is the existence of the stochastic orbits near the singularity and the transition to chaos .",
    "the analytical study in this case is hindered by the fact that the system given by the hamiltonian ( [ log2 ] ) does not admit any hyperbolic equilibrium points , and therefore , the perturbative methods which are usually employed in proving the existence of chaos ( including the melnikov method @xcite ) become unapplicable .",
    "we note that the melnikov method has been used in the past in the case of the logarithmic potential @xcite , however not on the exact hamiltonian , but on the integrable stckel hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "understanding the onset of chaos in the singular logarithmic potential is a very important problem for the construction of galaxy models based on libraries of orbits ( see for example , @xcite ) - in which generally , it is a priori assumed that the stochastic orbits play a negligible role .",
