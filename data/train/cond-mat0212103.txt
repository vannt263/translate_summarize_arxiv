    "in low - dimensional uniform bose gases , the single - particle correlations are fundamentally different from a three - dimensional gas , dramatically affecting the nature of the bose condensation phase transition @xcite .",

    "@xcite have created one- and two - dimensional _ trapped _ bose gases by making the level spacing of the confining potential ( along one or two directions ) larger than the mean - field interaction energy .",
    "recently , several experimental and theoretical studies have highlighted the manner in which the unique correlations of a uniform low - dimensional bose gas are modified in a trapped bose gas . with the increasing interest in bec matter wave interferometry and atom lasers ,",
    "it is clearly important to have a greater understanding of one - dimensional ( 1d ) trapped bose gases .    in uniform systems",
    ", it is well known that the behavior of bose gases is quite different in one- or two - dimensions compared to three - dimensions . in 3d , below a critical temperature @xmath0",

    "long wavelength fluctuations of the phase of the bose order parameter lead to a new state intermediate between a bose - condensed and non - bose - condensed system .",
    "the system forms a quasi - condensate , in which the phase of the order parameter is only coherent over a finite length scale .",
    "the system may be thought of as bose condensate sub - systems which are well defined locally but are not correlated with each other @xcite .",
    "the presence of a quasi - condensate causes the equal - time single - particle correlation function to spatially decay with a characteristic power law , @xmath2 , where the power law parameter @xmath3 is characteristic of the system . in a uniform two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose gas",
    ", a bose condensate can be shown to only occur at @xmath4 . at low but finite temperatures , however ,",
    "a 2d bose gas can form a quasi - condensate . in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) uniform bose gas ,",
    "true bose condensation never occurs , but at @xmath4 a quasi - condensate is possible .",
    "the central point is that the characteristic features of 1d and 2d quasi - condensates are associated with long wavelength , low frequency ( i.e. , long distances and times ) phase fluctuations of the bose order parameter .    in a _ trapped _",
    "bose gas , the effect of the long wavelength phase fluctuations is complicated by the finite size of the system . while a quasi - condensate is still locally coherent , the size of the system will play a crucial role .",
    "recent theoretical work on trapped bose gases has focussed on the static correlation properties of trapped 1d and 2d bose gases as a measure of the long - range phase coherence of the bose gas",
    ". early work by ho and ma @xcite considered primarily the zero - temperature ( vacuum ) phase fluctuations .",
    "they showed that the strong phase fluctuations were restricted by the finite size of the system and as a result the system could form a bose condensate even at @xmath4 . since the low lying collective modes have finite energy in a trapped bose gas , at sufficiently low temperatures the thermal fluctuations are frozen and the @xmath4 analysis still applies .",
    "the role of thermal fluctuations in determining the phase coherence of the trapped bose gas has been recently discussed in considerable detail by shlyapnikov and coworkers @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated @xcite that below a certain temperature @xmath5 , the long wavelength phase fluctuations in a trapped 1d bose gas are effectively frozen . as a result",
    ", the quasi - condensate of the uniform gas becomes a true bose condensate in the trapped gas for @xmath6 .",
    "this work was later extended to deal with the effect of phase fluctuations in a highly elongated ( cigar - shaped ) 3d bose gas @xcite , which was shown to behave as a quasi-1d bose gas .",
    "it was found that the long wavelength phase fluctuations above a certain temperature @xmath7 would still destroy long - range order , leading to a quasi - condensate .",
    "the role of phase fluctuations in an elongated 3d bose gas has been recently explored by dettmer et .",
    "@xcite , where evidence was found for a phase - fluctuating quasi - condensate by observation of characteristic interference effects in the freely expanding gas .",
    "this kind of real space interferometry experiment is a measure of the equal - time single - particle correlations of a bose gas .",
    "however , the theoretical analysis required to evaluate the effect of phase fluctuations is quite involved and somewhat indirect @xcite .",
    "the doppler - sensitive bragg scattering experiments recently performed in orsay @xcite give an alternative and perhaps a more direct probe of the single - particle correlations , albeit in momentum space .",
    "such bragg scattering techniques have been used to measure the excitations in a trapped 3d bose gas @xcite .",
    "out - coupling ( or tunneling ) experiments discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite also show how one can obtain information about the dynamic single - particle correlation functions of a trapped bose gas .",
    "there has been some related theoretical work on the absorption line shape of a uniform 1d bose gas @xcite .",
    "this type of experiment is also similar to tunneling between quantum wires used to probe the single - particle correlations in 1d electron systems @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the trapped 1d mean - field bose gas , as defined in refs .  @xcite . in section [ sec : correlation - functions ] , we summarize the calculation of low energy collective modes responsible for the long wavelength phase fluctuations using a quantized hydrodynamic theory @xcite . in section [ sec : static - correlation - function ] , we use these results to calculate the static correlation function for a quasi - condensate , following the work of shlyapnikov and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "the results for the static correlation function of a quasi - condensate are compared with that of a true bose condensate in the 1d trap at @xmath4 .",
    "we then calculate the momentum distribution of atoms both in quasi - condensates and true bose condensates , since this is the key quantity measured in doppler - sensitive bragg spectroscopy .",
    "this discussion of results for the static correlation function sets the stage for our generalization to 1d dynamic correlation functions in section [ sec : dynamic - correlation - function ] . in section [ sec : out - coupling - experiment ] , we show how this dynamic correlation function could be measured using a two - photon raman scattering ( out - coupling ) experiment .",
