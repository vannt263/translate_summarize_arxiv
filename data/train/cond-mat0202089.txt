    "recently layered cobalt oxides have been extensively investigated as a promising candidate for a thermoelectric material .",
    "the thermoelectric material is a material that shows large thermopower ( @xmath4 ) , low resistivity ( @xmath5 ) and low thermal conductivity ( @xmath6 ) @xcite , and a quantity of @xmath7 called the figure of merit characterizes the thermoelectric conversion efficiency .",
    "thermoelectric device can generate electric power from heat through the seebeck effect , and can pump heat through the peltier effect .",
    "thus far oxides have been regarded as unsuitable for thermoelectric application because of their poor mobility , but some years ago terasaki _ et al . _",

    "@xcite measured @xmath11 at 1000 k even in the polycrystalline samples of naco@xmath8o@xmath2 . thus this compound is quite promising for thermoelectric power generation at high temperature .    following naco@xmath8o@xmath2 , other layered cobalt oxides , ca - co - o @xcite , bi - sr - co - o @xcite , tl - sr - co - o @xcite",
    "have been found to show good thermoelectric performance . in particular ,",
    "et al_. @xcite showed @xmath12 at 1000 k for ca - co - o .",
    "the most important feature is that the cdi@xmath8 type triangular coo@xmath8 block is common to the layered cobalt oxides .",
    "we have proposed that the high thermoelectric performance of the layered cobalt oxides can not be explained by a conventional band picture based on the one - electron approximation , but is understood in terms of the strong electron - electron correlation effects , similarly to the case of heavy - fermion compounds .",
    "in fact the material dependence of the thermopower quite resembles that of ce@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a prime example for the difficulties of the one - electron picture is observed in the cu substitution effects in naco@xmath8o@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the thermopower of naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is significantly enhanced , while the resistivity is nearly independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this is quite surprising in comparison with normal impurity effects in a metal .",
    "the doped impurity acts as a scattering center in usual cases , and does not make a significant change in thermopower , because it is a quantity of the zero - th order of scattering time .",
    "indeed this is what was observed in high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "importantly , correlation effects can explain the large impurity effect on the thermopower , similarly to the case of dilute magnetic alloys @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "we report on measurement of specific heat , susceptibility , hall coefficient , and transverse magnetoresistance for naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 polycrystalline samples , and discuss the cu substitution effects quantitatively .",
    "polycrystalline samples of na@xmath14co@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath3=0 , 0.1 , 0.2 and 0.3 ) were prepared through a solid - state reaction .",
    "a stoichiometric amount of na@xmath8co@xmath15 , co@xmath15o@xmath2 and cuo was mixed and calcined at 860@xmath16c for 12 h in air .",
    "the product was finely ground , pressed into a pellet , and sintered at 920@xmath16c for 12 h in air .",
    "since na tends to evaporate during calcination , we added 20 % excess na .",
    "namely we expected samples of the nominal composition of na@xmath14co@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 to be naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was measured using a standard diffractometer with fe k@xmath17 radiation as an x - ray source in the @xmath18 scan mode .",
    "the resistivity was measured through a four - terminal method , and the thermopower was measured using a steady - state technique with a typical temperature gradient of 0.5 k / cm .",
    "the hall coefficient ( @xmath19 ) and the transverse magnetoresistance were measured from 15 to 100 k in a closed refrigerator inserted into a room temperature bore of a liquid - he free superconducting magnet . to eliminate the unwanted voltage arising from the misalignment of the voltage pads ,",
    "the magnetic field was swept from -7 to 7 t with a typical period of 20 min at constant temperatures with a stability of 10 mk .",
    "the specific heat was measured using a standard relaxation method with a mechanical heat switch .",
    "the mass of the samples used for the measurement is typically 1000 mg and the heat capacity of the samples is always more than two orders of magnitude larger than the addenda heat capacity . the susceptibility was measured with a squid susceptometer in a magnetic field of 1 t.    cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the fe k@xmath17 is used a an x - ray source.,width=302 ]",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the x - ray diffraction patterns of the prepared samples of naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "almost all the peaks are indexed as the @xmath20 phase @xcite , though a small amount ( approximately less than 5% ) of unreacted co@xmath15o@xmath2 is observed . with increasing cu content @xmath3 , no additional peak appears , with the patterns unchanged , which shows that cu is substituted for co. however , the sample of @xmath3=0.3 shows a higher background noise , indicating that the crystal quality becomes worse , possibly owing to the limit of solid solution with cu .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity for naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "all the samples are metallic down to 4.2 k without any indication of localization .",
    "it should be noted that the increased resistance due to the substituted cu is of the order of 10@xmath21 cm for 1 at.% cu , which is anomalously small in the layered transition - metal oxides @xcite .",
    "another important feature is that the resistivity for the cu substituted samples show a kink near 22 k as indicated by the dotted line .",
    "since the temperature dependence is steeper below 22 k , the density of states ( or the carrier concentration ) decreases below 22 k.    cu@xmath1o@xmath2.,width=302 ]    figure 2(b ) shows the temperature dependence of the thermopower for naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "thermopower increases with increasing @xmath3 with a dip near 22 k and a peak near 10 - 15 k. as we previously shown in the analysis for bi - sr - co - o @xcite , a low - temperature thermopower ( @xmath4 ) of the layered co oxides is determined by the diffusive term that is proportional to temperature ( @xmath22 ) . accordingly @xmath23 is an essential parameter similarly to the electron specific - heat coefficient .",
    "thus , the dip , rather than the peak , is a meaningful temperature , which corresponds to the onset of the enhancement in @xmath23 at low temperatures .",
    "it should be emphasized that the dip temperature is nearly the same as the kink temperature for the resistivity , which strongly suggests that this temperature is related to a kind of phase transition .     and ( b ) the susceptibility @xmath24 of polycrystalline samples of naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath25 is plotted in order to emphasize the electron specific heat coefficient @xmath20 .",
    "the samples include 5% of unreacted co@xmath15o@xmath2 , and the data for 5% co@xmath15o@xmath2 taken from refs , @xcite are plotted by the solid curves.,width=302 ]    figure 3(a ) shows the specific heat @xmath26 for naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 . in order to emphasize the @xmath22-linear electron specific heat , we plot @xmath25 as a function of temperature . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the @xmath25 value at 2 k decreases with increasing the cu content from 0 to 0.2 , which means the decrease of the electron specific heat coefficient @xmath20 with @xmath3 .",
    "( for the sample of @xmath3=0.3 , the @xmath25 value increases again , which might be due to an extrinsic origin such as the solid - solution limit of cu . ) since @xmath20 is proportional to the density of states and the mass - enhancement factor , the present results indicate that the either or both decrease with the cu substitution . as for high temperatures ,",
    "all the data show a peak near 30 k which is the antiferromagnetic transition of the unreacted co@xmath15o@xmath2 , as shown by the solid curve @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the x - ray diffraction patterns reveal less than 5 at.% of unreacted co@xmath15o@xmath2 , which is consistent with the peak height of the specific heat at 30 k. we should emphasize here that the existence of co@xmath15o@xmath2 does not seriously affect the estimation of @xmath20 , because the @xmath25 value for co@xmath15o@xmath2 is negligibly small at low temperatures . for @xmath270.2 and 0.3 , another peak appears in the specific heat near 22 k , which is close to the kink temperature in @xmath5 , and the dip temperature in @xmath4 .",
    "we thus conclude that the 22-k anomaly comes from a ( 2nd order ) phase transition .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the susceptibility ( @xmath24 ) of naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the substituted cu also decreases the susceptibility , indicating the decrease of the density of states and/or the mass - enhancement factor .",
    "a broad hump near 30 k is due to the antiferromagnetic transition of the unreacted co@xmath15o@xmath2 , as shown by the solid curve @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there is no anomaly near 22 k in the susceptibility , suggesting that the transition at 22 k is not the magnetic transition of impurity phases .",
    "we further note that the curie - like contribution is absent in the susceptibility at low temperatures , which shows that magnetic impurities are unlikely to exist other than co@xmath15o@xmath2 .",
    "quantitatively , the decrease of @xmath24 by cu is more moderate than that of @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath25 decreases by a factor of ten from @xmath28 to 0.2 , whereas @xmath24 decreases only by a factor of two .",
    "this implies that the 22-k transition causes a dramatic reduction of the electron entropy possibly owing to a ( pseudo)gap formation , while it does not alter the magnetic excitation at @xmath29 .",
    "the nature of the 22-k transition will be discussed in the next section .     and ( b ) the magnetoresistance @xmath30 of polycrystalline samples of naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2.,width=302 ]    figure 4(a )",
    "shows the hall coefficient ( @xmath19 ) of naco@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the sign is negative below 100 k , and the magnitude is as small as 4 - 6@xmath3110@xmath32 @xmath33/c . the cu substitution does not change the magnitude so much , indicating that the carrier concentration is nearly unchanged . by contrast",
    ", it changes the temperature dependence in a complicated way , which implies that plural kinds of carriers are responsible for the electric conduction .",
    "the band calculation by singh @xcite reveals that the two bands of different symmetries cross the fermi level for naco@xmath8o@xmath2 .",
    "( see the next section )    contrary to the hall effect , the magnetoresistance is weakly dependent on the cu substitution , as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) . by taking a closer look at the @xmath3 dependence",
    ", one can see that the negative magnetoresistance is gradually suppressed by the substituted cu .",
    "this implies that the kink of the resistivity is more or less smeared against magnetic field , which suggests that the magnetic field suppresses the 22-k transition .",
    "before going into details , we will begin with a brief review on the electronic states of naco@xmath8o@xmath2 .",
    "as is well known , the five - fold degenerate @xmath34 orbitals split into two - fold ( @xmath35 ) and three - fold ( @xmath36 ) degenerate levels in an oxygen octahedron . in the real triangular coo@xmath8 block ,",
    "the octahedron is compressed along the @xmath37 direction , and the degeneracy is further quenched , where the lower @xmath36 levels split into @xmath35 and @xmath38 levels .",
    "the lower @xmath35 levels correspond to the orbital spread along the coo@xmath8 block to make a relatively broad band , whilst the @xmath38 orbital is spread along the @xmath37 direction to make a nearly localized narrow band .",
    "since each co ion is 3.5 + with @xmath39 , the highest occupied orbital is @xmath38 in the atomic limit , and the main part of the fermi surface consists of the narrow @xmath38 band . in the real band calculation , however , there is significant hybridization between the @xmath38 and @xmath35 levels , and the broader @xmath40 band touches the fermi level to make small fermi surfaces @xcite .",
    "we have proposed that the electronic structure of naco@xmath8o@xmath2 is similar to that of the ce - based intermetallics , a prime example of valence - fluctuation / heavy - fermion compounds @xcite . @xmath20 and @xmath24 of naco@xmath8o@xmath2 are as large as those of cepd@xmath15 . in this context , the large thermopower of naco@xmath8o@xmath2 is explained in terms of a diffusive contribution of a metal with a heavily enhanced effective mass , and is roughly proportional to @xmath20 . in the heavy fermion compounds , the broad conduction band crosses the fermi energy , and the narrow ( localized ) f band is located below the fermi energy . for naco@xmath8o@xmath2 ,",
    "the broad @xmath40 band and the narrow @xmath38 band do exist , but both of which cross the fermi energy to form two kinds of the fermi surfaces . thus it is not trivial whether or not the two fermi surfaces behave heavy - fermion - like in the charge transport .",
    "at least we can say that the two fermi surfaces play different roles , where the cu substitution induces different effects : @xmath5 is weakly dependent on the cu content @xmath3 , whereas @xmath4 , @xmath24 and @xmath20 are strongly dependent on @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 , @xmath24 and @xmath20 are basically proportional to the density of states in the lowest order , which are determined by the large fermi surface of the @xmath38 symmetry . in contrast , the carriers on the @xmath40 band can be highly mobile , because it is spread along the in - plane direction .",
    "in short , the @xmath38 and @xmath40 bands are responsible for the large thermopower and a good electric conduction , respectively .",
    "existence of the @xmath38 and @xmath40 bands was suggested from the angular dependence of the x - ray absorption spectroscopy experiment @xcite , where the valence bands of naco@xmath8o@xmath2 consist of the @xmath38 and @xmath40 bands .",
    "the valence band of the less conductive bi - sr - co - o is mainly composed only of the @xmath38 band , which is consistent with our speculation that the @xmath40 band is responsible for the metallic nature of naco@xmath8o@xmath2 . the large fermi surface suggested by the band calculation was not seen in the angle photoemission spectra for bi - sr - co - o , which indicates that the band calculation should be modified by additional effects such as the electron - electron or electron - phonon effects .",

    "the inset shows the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat.,width=302 ]      as shown in the previous section , the cu substitution causes the phase transition at 22 k , which is probed by the jump of the specific heat , the dip in the thermopower , and the kink in the resistivity .",
    "figure [ fig5](a ) shows the specific heat for the @xmath43 sample ( the same data in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) as a function of temperature in linear scale in order to see the 22-k anomaly clearly .",
    "one thing to point out is that the entropy change of this transition is surprisingly small . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , we estimated the entropy change by the area surrounded with @xmath25 and the dotted line , which is approximately 77 mj / kmol , corresponding to 0.01@xmath44 per co. actually only 5% of co@xmath15o@xmath2 impurity exhibits a specific heat jump of the same order at 30 k.    there are two possibilities for the origin of the small entropy change .",
    "one is that the 22-k transition is something related to the impurity phase of the order of 1% .",
    "although we can not exclude this possibility completely , we will take the other possibility that the small entropy change is an intrinsic nature in bulk , because ( i ) the field dependence of @xmath25 is different between the 22-k transition and the magnetic transition in co@xmath15o@xmath2 at 30 k as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , ( ii ) a possible impurity phase is a cu - based magnetic material , which is inconsistent with no anomaly in @xmath24 at 22 k , and ( iii ) the thermopower and the resistivity systematically change at the same temperature .",
    "the most familiar phase transition accompanied by a small entropy change is perhaps superconducting transition .",
    "more generally , off - diagonal long range order induces a small entropy change of the order of @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ fig5](c ) shows the @xmath22-linear term of the thermopower ( @xmath23 ) and the temperature derivative of the resistivity @xmath46 , both of which are inversely proportional to the drude weight @xcite .",
    "their temperature dependences are quite similar to each other , where the magnitude increases up to almost twice below 22 k. this indicates that the drude weight decreases by 50% at low temperatures , implying the existence of a ( pseudo)gap . as an off - diagonal long - range order with a gapped state , one would think of charge density wave ( cdw ) or spin density wave ( sdw ) .",
    "the calculated fermi surface @xcite of the @xmath38 band is hexagon - like , which is unstable against cdw or sdw formation with the nesting vector along the @xmath47-k direction .",
    "we think that the 22-k transition is sdw - like , because cdw is insensitive to magnetic field @xcite .",
    "actually we can find many similarities between the 22-k transition and sdw transition : the entropy change is observed to be quite small in cr @xcite , ybbipt @xcite and ( tmtsf)@xmath8pf@xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the resistivity shows a hump @xcite , and the thermopower shows a dip at the transition@xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that the 22-k transition has little effects on the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "since an sdw state is an antiferromagnetically ordered state , the magnetic excitation is gapless in principle .",
    "in fact , the sdw state of cr exhibits a very tiny ( 1 - 2% ) change in the susceptibility at the transition temperature @xcite , while it causes a clear hump in the resistivity @xcite .",
    "the metallic conduction below 22 k , implies that a part ( approximately 50% ) of the fermi surface remains , which could smears the sdw transition . to clarify the nature of the transition , a local magnetic probe such as nmr or @xmath49sr",

    "when the kondo temperature is sufficiently low as in the case of cepb@xmath15 , the rkky interaction survives at low temperatures , and often causes a magnetic transition .",

    "the cu substitution enhances the instability , and eventually causes the sdw - like transition at 22 k. this type of transition is called `` order from disorder '' @xcite , which has been extensively investigated experimentally as well as theoretically .",

    "the substituted cu induces a phase transition at 22 k , which is characterized by the kink in the resistivity , the hump in the thermopower , and the jump in the specific heat .",
    "we have analysed the nature of the transition , and finally proposed a spin - density - wave - like state as a possible origin , because ( i ) it accompanies a small entropy change of the order of 10@xmath92 per co , ( ii ) the transition is sensitive to the magnetic field , ( iii ) the large fermi surface of the @xmath38 character is gapped . the impurity induced transition",
    "is often called `` order from disorder '' , which implies that phase transitions are somehow suppressed in the unsubstituted naco@xmath8o@xmath2 .    above the transition temperature ,",
    "the thermoelectric properties are at least qualitatively compared with those of heavy - fermions valence - fluctuation compounds , where mobile holes on the @xmath40 band and the nearly localized holes of the @xmath38 band correspond to the carrier and the @xmath93 electrons . in this analogy ,",
    "the substituted cu increase the interaction between the @xmath40 and @xmath38 bands to decrease the effective - mass enhancement .    in this article",
    "we have reviewed the phenomenology of the cu substitution effects , but failed to address the microscopic origin and/or the electronic states of the substituted cu .",
    "this is because our experiments were concerned only with the thermodynamic and transport properties of bulk materials .",
    "nonetheless we can say that the scattering cross section will be small for the @xmath94 and @xmath95 levels of the impurity in naco@xmath8o@xmath2 , because the valence bands of naco@xmath8o@xmath2 consist of @xmath36 .",
    "thus the substituted cu ( possibly divalent @xcite ) will not increase @xmath5 seriously , because cu@xmath96 has the highest occupied orbital of @xmath94 that is orthogonal to @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , strong jahn - teller effects of cu@xmath96 may cause local distortion of the coo@xmath8 block , which serves as a kind of chemical pressure to increase @xmath4 @xcite . to proceed further , site - selective probes such as nmr , photoemission , and stm / sts should be employed .",
