    "the incomplete plasma dispersion function , defined as @xmath0 for @xmath1 and as its analytic continuation for @xmath2 , was introduced by franklin.@xcite it is a generalization of the plasma dispersion function,@xcite which corresponds to the limit @xmath3 : @xmath4 . like the plasma dispersion function",
    ", it arises in the linear plasma dielectric function and corresponding wave dispersion relations .",
    "however , the plasma dispersion function describes maxwellian distributions , whereas eq .",
    "( [ eq : ipdf ] ) describes non - maxwellian distributions so long as they can be approximated as maxwellian in finite , or semi - infinite , intervals of velocity phase - space .",
    "each interval may have different characteristic densities , flow speeds and temperatures associated with them .",
    "situations where a plasma is far from equilibrium , but model distribution functions can be formulated in terms of piecewise maxwellians are prevalent.@xcite an early application was in the study of waves near the boundaries of q - machine plasmas.@xcite there ions were modeled with a distribution consisting of only the high - energy tail of a maxwellian .",
    "electrons trapped by the confining ion sheaths were considered maxwellian , whereas the passing interval was depleted in density .",
    "these distributions are depicted by the dashed and sold lines , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fg : ex_f]a .",
    "this type of depleted electron distribution is commonly found in the presence of potential barriers , such as sheaths near material walls,@xcite or probes,@xcite as well as double layers which provide an electrostatic barrier between plasmas with differing properties ( density , temperature , etc.).@xcite potential barriers create a trapped - passing boundary for one or more species . at the edge of an absorbing wall sheath ,",
    "for example , the passing interval of the electron distribution will be empty .",
    "this depleted region can significantly alter the plasma dielectric response .",
    "for example , it has been shown to reduce the threshold for temperature - anisotropy - driven whistler instabilities near the boundary of magnetized plasmas.@xcite scattering can fill in the depleted region such that the density of the passing interval increases away from the potential barrier .",
    "also , in some applications , secondary electron emission can generate an additional population of tail electrons,@xcite see fig .",
    "[ fg : ex_f]b , which may also be modeled using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ipdf ] ) .",
    "other examples include electron sheaths , double sheaths and double layers that arise when a boundary is biased more positive than the plasma potential.@xcite in these situations the electron distribution can often be modeled as a depleted half - maxwellian with a flow shift ; see fig .",
    "[ fg : ex_f]a .",
    "phelps and allen studied waves in the presence of a double sheath with electron emitting boundaries.@xcite they modeled the electron distribution as a background maxwellian with an additional flowing half - maxwellian component generated by wall emission . by modeling the electrons in this manner , they were able to accurately predict measured wave dispersion relations for high frequency waves .",
    "they noted that ions in these configurations can resemble maxwellian distributions with a hole at low energies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : ex_f]c",
    ".    the incomplete plasma dispersion function may also be useful for studying waves after non - linear process have modified a velocity distribution function , such as flattening of a region of velocity - space due to a driven wave or instability,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : ex_f]e .",
    "another common example is the plateau distribution following the quasilinear evolution of a bump - on - tail distribution , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fg : ex_f]d .",
    "these have been measured for ions downstream of current - free double layers.@xcite piecewise maxwellian distributions have also been used to model electrons upstream of current - free double layers,@xcite as well as double layers that form in electronegative plasmas.@xcite    the incomplete plasma dispersion function may also find use in magnetic reconnection research .",
    "a recent theory proposes that large scale parallel electric fields can both accelerate electrons and create a trapped - passing barrier that affects the electron distribution.@xcite in this model , the parallel electron distribution is maxwellian in the tails and constant in the intermediate region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : ex_f]f .",
    "notably , eq .  ( [ eq : ipdf ] ) will arise in the dispersion relation of collisionless tearing modes , which can be a trigger for fast reconnection in magnetospheric plasmas .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide several properties of the incomplete plasma dispersion function that are useful for applying it to the linear dielectric response and wave dispersion relations in piecewise maxwellian plasmas .",

    "[ sec : pvsd ] the depleted region is modeled as a colder maxwellian ( returning the results of sec .",
    "[ sec : vsd ] in the limit of zero tail temperature ) .",
    "waves in plasmas with gently depleted tails,@xcite as well as lorentzian ( or kappa ) distributions@xcite have also been studied previously .",
    "ion - acoustic and langmuir wave dispersion relations are shown to be significantly modified when the trapped - passing boundary affects the bulk distribution ( i.e. , it is near the thermal speed ) , and the temperature characterizing the passing population is low enough .",
    "for instance , one significant modification to langmuir waves is the absence of landau damping for modes with phase velocity beyond the trapped - passing boundary because of the lack of resonant electrons . similar undamped ( or weakly damped ) waves have previously been studied in the high frequency limit near a floating probe using a total depletion model .",
    "the modeled wave properties were also confirmed using a probe and spectrum analyzer.@xcite similarly , the dispersion relations developed in secs .  [ sec : vsd ] and [ sec : pvsd ] should be accessible to experimental measurement with the classical probe techniques .",
