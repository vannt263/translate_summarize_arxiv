    "the propagation of colloidal particles through polymer solutions presents us with mathematical problems of considerable complexity , both at low and high velocities . a major simplification results if we focus on a particle of nanometer dimensions for the following reasons :    1)if the size is much smaller than the correlation length of , say , a semidilute polymer solution , the equilibrium depletion theory simplifies considerably ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "\\2 ) if the solvent is intermediate rather than excellent as is often the case in practice ( @xcite ) , it suffices to use a self - consistent field description based on chain entropy alone ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the polymer may be viewed as quasi - ideal .",
    "\\3 ) it can be argued that the motion may be split up into two types of dynamics : dynamic depletion as a result of the rearrangement of the local polymer density about the particle , and the translation of the dressed particle ( i.e. the particle together with its depletion layer ) through the strongly fluctuating polymeric suspension ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is valid because the two respective time scales are well separated .",
    "\\4 ) the polymer stress is highest close to the moving nanoparticle ( @xcite ) so it is reasonable to suppose the dynamics of a chain section nearby is rouselike or freely draining ( @xcite,@xcite ) . in effect , the polymer density is low in the depletion layer , for the density must be zero at the particle surface .",
    "\\5 ) in general , at very high velocities , the elasticity of the polymer must come into play which could lead to complex phenomena like shock waves ( @xcite ) .",
    "an important dimensionless variable is then the ratio of the particle velocity to that of the elastic waves .",
    "but it is probably safe to neglect these when the size of the nanoparticle is much smaller than the distance between entanglements in the polymer solution .    besides being of intrinsic interest from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the fast translation of small particles through semidilute polymer does occur in practice , namely during capillary gel electrophoresis of biomacromolecules at high electric fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "i focus on the fast propagation of a nanoparticle , a problem reminiscent of others in condensed matter physics ( e.g. convective diffusion ( @xcite ) , runaway electrons in a plasma ( @xcite ) , the increase of dissociation of weak electrolytes ( @xcite ) and the complex electrokinetics of charged colloidal spheres ( @xcite ) under high electric fields ) .",
    "it turns out that the motion of a nanoparticle through a semidilute polymer is quite similar , though not identical , to that of convective diffusion occurring near a particle translating through a solution of some molecular species , which is continuously absorbed at the surface of the particle .",
    "hence , levich s analysis proves to be useful ( @xcite ) .",
    "the peclet number @xmath0 is important in the theory of convective diffusion .",
    "a sphere of radius @xmath1 is surrounded by a zone of size @xmath1 , partly depleted of absorbing , diffusing molecules .",
    "the time scale @xmath2 of diffusion where @xmath3 is the diffusion coefficient of the molecules , has to be balanced against the time scale @xmath4 of convection if the sphere has a speed @xmath5 . at high peclet numbers",
    "@xmath6 , convection has a dramatic impact on the shape of the diffusional layer ( @xcite ) . in the polymer case",
    ", the analogous phenomenon may be termed convective depletion but it is determined by a different dimensionless number defined by@xmath7 in the case at hand ( @xcite ) , the depletion layer of size @xmath1 pertains to a section of polymer chain consisting of @xmath8 depleted segments of kuhn length @xmath9 and diffusion coefficient @xmath10 .",
    "i thus introduce eq ( 1 ) in the rouse approximation . accordingly",
    ", one expects the depletion layer to be deformed strongly by convection at high @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamics of a nanosphere in a semidilute solution of flexible polymer of concentration @xmath12 has been discussed previously ( @xcite ) .",
    "the free energy of depletion @xmath13 is solely of entropic origin and is a functional of @xmath14 , the density of polymer segments at position @xmath15 and time @xmath16@xmath17   = \\frac{1}{6}a^{2}% k_{b}t\\int d\\overrightarrow{r}\\left (   \\overrightarrow{\\nabla}c^{\\frac{1}{2}% } \\right )   ^{2 } \\label{vgl2}%\\ ] ] here , @xmath18 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath19 is the temperature . for convenience ,",
    "the sphere is held fixed and its centre is the origin of our cartesian coordinate system . at great distances from the sphere ,",
    "the polymer solution flows uniformly with velocity @xmath20 in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "the flow is perturbed by two effects : the solvent is assumed to stick to the sphere , and the polymer segments can not penetrate its surface ; the stick boundary condition seems reasonable since the polymer density tends to zero at the surface ( i.e. we have depletion ) and we may argue that the segments within the depletion layer are essentially rouselike , exerting little backflow on the solvent itself ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the radius @xmath1 of the sphere is much smaller than both the polymer correlation and hydrodynamic screening lengths .",
    "hence , the velocity @xmath22 of a test segment is given by a balance of forces@xmath23 where @xmath24 is the background velocity of the incompressible solvent , @xmath25 is the force on the test segment by virtue of its connection to some chain section and @xmath26 is the mobility of the segment .",
    "the gradient of the chemical potential @xmath27 now drives the reorganization of the segment distribution via the equation of continuity and eqs ( [ vgl2 ] ) and ( [ vgl3 ] ) ; the chemical potential of a segment is @xmath28.@xmath29 i have here introduced @xmath30 and a dimensionless wavefunction  @xmath31 .",
    "this equation has been solved for a sphere translating slowly under stationary conditions in the absence of convection ( @xcite ) .",
    "here , i wish to investigate convective depletion for fast uniform propagation of the sphere in the steady state .",
    "it turns out to be expedient to let the stokes stream function @xmath32  become the independent variable in problems involving convection ( @xcite ) @xmath33@xmath34@xmath35 the stokes stream function and velocity of the solvent , here given in terms of spherical coordinates @xmath36 ( @xcite ) , are assumed to be unperturbed by the polymer within the zone of depletion .",
    "i next switch from the variables @xmath37 to the new independent variables @xmath38 assuming axisymmetry . it is readily shown that the convective term in eq ( 4 ) reduces to@xmath39 with the help of eqs ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .    at this juncture",
    ", i introduce an approximation at high @xmath40 levich has treated the convective diffusion of a fast moving sphere at high peclet number ( @xcite ) and it is expedient to follow closely the spirit of his analysis of the thin boundary layer in front of such a particle .",
    "there is a stagnation point at @xmath41 and @xmath42 , so at high velocities one may picture the region of polymer depletion as in fig .",
    "it is compressed by convection into a layer thinner than the radius of the sphere .",
    "hence , i introduce the coordinate @xmath43  with @xmath44  in the regime of interest and approximate eqs ( 5 - 7 ) to the leading order as follows @xmath45@xmath46@xmath47 these equations describe the unperturbed flow of the incompressible solvent in the boundary layer",
    ". eq ( 4 ) is now rewritten as @xmath48   \\right\\vert _ { \\theta } \\label{vgl12}%\\ ] ] with the help of eqs ( 8 - 11 ) .",
    "hence , we attain an expression for the convective depletion within the boundary layer at the front of the sphere as a function of two new independent variables : the stokes stream function @xmath32 by first eliminating @xmath49  using eqs ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) , and the variable @xmath50 for convenience.@xmath51   \\label{vgl13}%\\]]@xmath52@xmath53 here , @xmath54  is a constant .",
    "it is now useful to introduce the boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath55@xmath56@xmath57@xmath58 the first equation expresses the usual depletion of the polymer at the surface which i suppose to be independent of the velocity of the particle . far away from it ,",
    "the polymer density must tend to the bulk value ( eq ( 17 ) .",
    "however , eq ( 16 ) does not hold at @xmath41 for there is a point of stagnation at @xmath59 @xmath60  so we require the boundary condition given by eq ( 18 ) .",
    "finally , polymer segments can not penetrate the sphere so the radial flux @xmath61  of polymer to the surface must be zero .",
    "this leads to the condition given by eq ( 19 ) upon temporarily reverting to the variable @xmath49 .  in view of the boundary conditions and the form of eq ( 13 )",
    ", it is now possible to posit a similarity solution @xmath62  in terms of the variable @xmath63 .",
    "the resulting equation is then further simplified with the help of the new independent variable @xmath64.@xmath65 this nonlinear equation looks rather awkward but a local analysis turns out to be useful .",
    "usually one would substitute @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68  and @xmath69  into eq ( 20 ) to decrease the order of the equation by one but this does not appear to be useful here .",
    "i have not attempted to derive a uniformly valid approximation to eq ( 20 ) because the term @xmath70 appears to play a significant role at @xmath71 .",
    "nevertheless , a local analysis within three regimes is fruitful for this term happens to be negligible close to and far away from the sphere .      at the surface of the sphere , the polymer density vanishes ( eq ( 16 ) ) so that a series expansion of the form@xmath72 may be assumed with @xmath73  and @xmath74  and where @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77  are constants . upon substituting this into eq ( 20 )",
    ", one discerns that there are only two viable solutions , if @xmath78  and @xmath79 .",
    "next if the radial polymer flux to the sphere is required to vanish ( eq ( 19 ) ) , @xmath80  must either be equal to unity or be greater than @xmath81 .",
    "hence , the only feasible solution for @xmath82 is if @xmath78 . again inserting eq ( 21 ) into eq ( 20 ) establishes the value of @xmath83  and the constants @xmath84  and @xmath77@xmath85 the term in eq ( 20 ) containing the second derivative contributes only at order @xmath86 in eq ( 22 ) .",
    "next , the boundary condition at the point of stagnation ( eq 18 ) determines the value of the constant @xmath87 ; at @xmath41 , @xmath88 must be nonzero for @xmath89 .",
    "next , i attempt a wkb approximation in the region far away from the sphere by writing @xmath90  with @xmath91.the term containing the second derivative is then subdominant and the order of the resulting linear equation is reduced by unity with the aid of the substitution @xmath92@xmath93 there seems to be a turning point at @xmath94  but i focus on the outer region @xmath95  only , since there is at least one intermediate regime centered around @xmath71  where @xmath96  competes with @xmath97 .",
    "there are three wkb solutions to eq ( 23 ) ( @xcite)@xmath98@xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101  are the three roots of the equation @xmath102.the outer solution obeying eq ( 17 ) is then@xmath103@xmath104      according to eqs ( 22 ) and ( 26 ) , the ( square root of ) the polymer density exhibits the oscillatory profile depicted in fig ( 2 ) with an as yet unknown intermediate regime at around @xmath71  with at least one maximum , the first , centered at @xmath105 say .",
    "we taylor expand @xmath106  around @xmath105@xmath107 upon substituting this in eq ( 20 ) , we see that the coefficient @xmath108 is positive as it should be .",
    "one expects @xmath109  and @xmath110  so that @xmath111  and @xmath108 are also@xmath112 for consistency .",
    "it is difficult to ascertain the stability of the solution determined by eq ( 20 ) with regard to eq ( 4 ) under general circumstances in view of the inhomogeneity of the fluid velocity coupled to the nonlinear depletion ( even though it is quasilinear ) .",
    "nevertheless , it can be shown that the solution is hadamard stable .",
    "let us first rewrite the similarity variable @xmath88  in terms of the original coordinates @xmath113 and @xmath49  pertaining to the boundary layer@xmath114 accordingly , i introduce an angular - dependent thickness of the layer defined by@xmath115 both @xmath88 and @xmath116 are well behaved as @xmath117  tends to zero and valid right up to @xmath118 , to a good approximation .",
    "i note that they are independent of the bulk density @xmath12 because eq ( 4 ) is quasilinear .",
    "next , the force on the sphere is defined by@xmath119 the integration applies only to the region definable as the boundary layer . since @xmath120 , i introduce a derjaguin approximation where the distance of a point with coordinates @xmath121 to  the surface of the sphere is given by @xmath122.the radial coordinate @xmath123  is perpendicular to the @xmath21 axis .",
    "the integral in eq ( 30 ) is thus rewritten as@xmath124@xmath125    to the leading order , @xmath126 may be simplified after several integrations by parts and the substitution @xmath127@xmath128   ^{2}\\simeq\\frac{a}{\\delta\\left ( 0\\right )   } \\label{vgl32}%\\ ] ] we conclude that the force on the sphere is inversely proportional to the thickness of the boundary layer @xmath129.@xmath130 this is consistent with the force of depletion @xmath131  at low velocities derived previously ( @xcite ) ; the crossover is at @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the force on a sphere arising from convective depletion is illustrated for a globular protein propagating fast through a semidilute polymer under the influence of a constant uniform electric field @xmath134 .",
    "if the protein bears @xmath135 positive elementary charges of charge @xmath136 , the force @xmath137  on the protein ultimately causes it to translate uniformly with a velocity @xmath138 given by eqs ( 29 ) and ( 33),@xmath139 here it is convenient to introduce @xmath140 , a dimensionless electric field scaled by the bjerrum length @xmath141(@xmath142 @xmath143 for water at room temperature ; @xmath144  if @xmath145is given in units of @xmath146 ) .",
    "eq ( 34 ) is only valid at high enough fields : @xmath147 with @xmath148 because the crossover must occur when the dimensionless quantity given by eq ( 1 ) is of order unity ; @xmath149 is about @xmath150 for a protein bearing 10 positive charges translating through a  polymer solution of volume fraction @xmath151 .",
    "the electrophoretic velocity is thus a sensitive function of the protein charge and its dimensions .",
    "electrophoresis in polymer gels at high electric fields could well be a useful technique for the separation of a mixture of proteins .",
    "very high fields are currently employed in microchip electrophoresis because joule heating may be kept to a minimum ( @xcite ) .",
