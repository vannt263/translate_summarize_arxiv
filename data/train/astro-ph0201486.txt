    "it has recently been recognized that the star formation activity in galaxies is very irregular in time , and many examples of major burst episodes exhibit an extremely high star formation rate concentrated in well localized space regions ( terlevich 1996 ) .",
    "it is also now well known that starbursts ( sbs ) cause an emission that dominates the entire host galaxy luminosity and their mechanical energy input rate is expected to cause major structural changes in the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) . in this respect",
    "it has become of great interest to study the properties of the resultant large - scale expanding superbubbles which , powered by the violently injected newly processed matter , establish the time scale for mixing with the ism ( tenorio - tagle 1996 , silich et al .",
    "2001 ) . in extreme cases ,",
    "the superbubbles are thought to break out of the galactic discs leading to an effective mass and energy transport into the low density halos or even into the intergalactic medium via a superwind ( heckman 1990 ) .",
    "starbursts in the local universe are also assumed to be good representatives of the star - forming activity at high redshifts .",
    "this concept defines their cosmological interest as key laboratories for studying the ism , the transport of supernovae processed metals , as well as the chemical evolution of galaxies and of the intergalactic medium .",
    "the resulting structure in the ism due to mechanical energy injected by sbs is very similar to the interstellar wind - blown bubbles around single massive stars ( see weaver 1977 for their four zone model ) , although the much larger energy input rate in sbs leads rapidly to much larger scales .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations ( see tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 , bisnovatyi - kogan & silich 1995 and references therein ; suchkov 1994 ; silich & tenorio - tagle 1998 ; dercole & brighenti 1999 ; strickland & stevens 2000 ) currently include differential galactic rotation , radiative cooling , strong density gradients between the disk and the halo and thus are able to follow the moment of breakout , as well as the fragmentation of the expanding outer shell via rayleigh - taylor instabilities and the venting of the superbubble hot interior gas , either into the intergalactic space , or into the host galaxy halo ( the blowout phenomenon ) .",
    "most of the up to - date simulations have been performed under the assumption of a constant energy deposition rate , as expected from an instantaneous burst model .",
    "however , studies of the stellar population in ob associations related to young ( @xmath9 myr ) large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) bubbles ( see oey & smedley , 1998 and references therein ) have demonstrated that `` realistic '' energy input rates are very different from the assumed constant energy input rates used in numerical simulations .",
    "thus the instantaneous burst assumptions may not be applicable to all cases .",
    "here we attempt to establish a method of comparison between the theory of superbubbles and the observations of remnants produced by massive star formation in galaxies .",
    "two possible modes of star formation , instantaneous and extended bursts , are taken into consideration .",
    "for both cases the mechanical luminosity , ultraviolet photon output , mass returned to the ism , and the fraction of each in metals , all as a function of time , are estimated .",
    "on the other hand we have the observed parameters : the h@xmath0 or h@xmath10 luminosity which can be directly related to the sfr under the assumption that all photons are used up in the ionized region .",
    "one can also estimate the size and luminosity of the x - ray remnant . in some cases",
    "the remnants may have slowed down sufficiently to display their outer expanding shells , either in the optical or in hi observations , or both , giving further information about the size , expansion speed , and mass behind the outer shock .",
    "a comparison with the theory also requires some preconception of the galaxy s ism , which can as a first approximation be derived from hi observations and the inferred dynamical mass .",
    "however , one also needs to make an assumption about the fraction of this gas locked up in dense clouds and immersed into a less dense ism background .    with the aim of establishing a method to confront theory with observations that may lead us to infer the recent star formation history of galaxies , the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) vii zw403",

    "section 3 summarizes the main observational properties of our target .",
    "section 4 presents a summary of the hydrodynamical calculations aimed at matching the observed properties .",
    "the results of the calculations and our main findings are discussed in section 5 .",
    "following the observational evidence in support of the concept of a continuous star formation spread over 10 - 20 myr or more ( herbst & miller 1982 , stahler 1985 , coziol et al .",
    "2001 ) , shull & saken ( 1995 ) have discussed five possible tracks of the star formation rate ( sfr ) time evolution , including both the time span of star formation , and possible time variations in the initial mass function ( imf ) . here",
    "we examine one of their cases : a constant sfr spread over a finite time interval @xmath11 . we compare its intrinsic properties with the standard instantaneous model .",
    "the simple model discussed below can be generalized to more sophisticated cases with a time dependent sfr and a variable imf .",
    "let us assume an instantaneous burst characterized by an imf with an exponent @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total mass of the sb cluster , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the lower and upper cut - off masses , respectively .",
    "from this one can calculate the expected energy and mass input rates .",
    "the mechanical energy deposition from a starburst should include both the energy injection via stellar winds and from supernova explosions . here",
    "the early mechanical energy injection ( before the first supernova explosion at @xmath17 = @xmath18 ) has been approximated by a constant value @xmath19 , which adds the contribution of all individual massive stars in the cluster .",

    "the maximum energy deposition is delayed in time , and converges with the 1 myr values after approximately 25 myr .",
    "the energy deposition rate for @xmath64 = 50 myr star forming episode suffers an even longer delay , to reach values similar to the maximum input from the previous two models , and then slowly decays without reaching a uniform value throughout the 100 myr of its evolution .",
    "the production rate of @xmath46 photons ( see figure 1b ) is highly dependent on the star formation time considered .",

    "it then falls very steeply , reaching before 10 myr of evolution , values more than two orders of magnitude smaller than its maximum value .",

    "vii zw403 is a bcd galaxy considered in recent years in many discussions related to star formation histories and possible impact of dwarf systems on the surrounding intergalactic medium . although tully et al .",
    "( 1981 ) proposed that the galaxy might be a member of m81 group , more recent distance determinations ( lynds et al .",
    "1998 ) locate it about 1.5 mpc further away at 4.5 mpc distance .",
    "therefore it can be considered an isolated galaxy ( schulte - ladbeck et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the x - ray observations ( papaderos et al . 1994 ; fourniol 1997 ) added more interest to the system , as they revealed an extended kpc - scale region of diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "these observations account for approximately 85% of the total x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath67 erg s@xmath3 ) from the central unresolved core , while the remaining 15% is spread over the central kpc - scale region .",

    "this is most probably a powerful ( l@xmath68 erg s@xmath3 ) binary system .",
    "however , the kpc - scale diffuse component was not confirmed by these observations , possibly due to the low sensitivity of the hri .",

    "the extension of the neutral hydrogen halo r@xmath72 is not well known , but if the average ratio of the hi size to the optical size is accepted to be f = 2.4 ( thuan & martin , 1981 ) , the hi halo radius r@xmath73 is about 1.9 kpc .",
    "a similar result is obtained if one assumes that the galaxy boundary occurs at the location where the escape velocity drops below the ism random velocity @xmath74 .",
    "lynds et al .",
    "( 1998 ) showed that the stellar population of vii zw403 contains not only young blue main - sequence stars , but also a much older evolved population that can be traced up to 1 - 2 gyrs back in time .",
    "they also studied the five centrally concentrated associations of young stars , with ages smaller than 10 myr , and that in h@xmath0 emission appear to be surrounded by local small shells with radii @xmath75 pc .",
    "schulte - ladbeck et al . ( 1999 ) provided a near infrared single star photometry of the galaxy and confirmed that compact , young star - forming regions are embedded into a much older , low surface brightness halo .",
    "we present here new narrow - band images of vii zw403 centered on the @xmath76 line and on the adjacent continuum ( figure 2 ) which were taken in august 1997 at the 2.2-m telescope of the german  spanish astronomical observatory at calar alto ( almera , spain ) .",
    "the instrumentation consisted of the _ calar alto faint object spectrograph _ ( cafos ) and a @xmath77 site ccd chip , with a pixel size of 0.53 arcsec , and an un - vignetted circular field of view of about 11 arcmin in diameter ( 14.4 kpc at the accepted distance to the galaxy of 4.5 mpc ) .",
    "the averaged seeing was 1.5 arcsec .",
    "the image reduction was conducted using standard procedures available in iraf .",
    "each image was corrected for bias using an average bias frame , and was flattened by dividing by a mean twilight flat field image .",
    "after , they were registered ( for each filter we took a set of dithered exposures ) and combined to obtain the final frame , with cosmic rays removed and bad pixels cleaned .",
    "the average sky level was estimated by computing the mean value within various boxes surrounding the object , and subtracted out as a constant .",
    "flux calibration was done through the observation of spectrophotometric stars from oke ( 1990 ) . for more details about data reduction and calibration",
    "refer to cairs ( 2001 ) .",
    "we calculated the integrated h@xmath0 flux out to the limiting isophote with a level equal to @xmath78 of the background . in our case",
    "this threshold is @xmath1 erg s@xmath3 @xmath2 .",
    "the h@xmath0 flux was corrected for galactic extinction following burstein & heiles ( 1984 ) .",
    "no correction for internal extinction was performed .",
    "our h@xmath0 image shown in figure 2 displays a variety of shapes and structures which deserve discussion . besides the starburts knots , labeled 1 - 5 after lynds ( 1998 )",
    ", we detect a much fainter and extended well structured diffuse emission .",
    "the largest obvious feature is a broken to the sw shell - like structure , 250 pc in radius , which we associate with knot 4 .",
    "knot 2 is almost overlapping in projection along its eastern rim .    on top of features and structures which appear to build a network of connecting knots , there is down to our limiting flux a diffuse - smooth emission which engulfs them all and most certainly results from photons leaking out of the main emitting knots .    the total h@xmath0 luminosity is higher than reported previously .",
    "clearly our limiting flux is much lower than that of lynds ( their figure 2 ) .",
    "our data recovers the low intensity h@xmath0 emission and thus provides a more precise estimate of the total h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "the spatial resolution of the hst image ( lynds , 1998 ) also allows for the detection of a much smaller h@xmath0 mini - bubble ( cocoon ) , associated with knot 1 .",
    "this bubble has similar energy to that inferred for the large superbubble reported above , however it seems much less evolved .",
    "the energy dumped by the cluster energizing knot 1 has not been able to sweep and displace so efficiently the surrounding ism out of which it formed .",
    "the above result has a profound impact on the modeling of starbursts . clearly during the first few myr of evolution",
    "every center of star formation disperses its high density parental cloud .",
    "it is only after this task has been completed that the various star forming centers that compose a starburst would be able to jointly build up a large - scale superbubble .",
    "the main observational properties of vii zw403 from the above mentioned literature and our own observations are summarized in the table 1 .",
    "a successful model has to be able to match simultaneously all observed parameters .",
    "in the case of vii zw403 these are : the size ( @xmath79 1 kpc ) of the diffuse x - ray emitting region , the h@xmath12 and the x - ray ( l@xmath80 erg s@xmath3 ) luminosities .",
    "note that lynds ( 1998 ) give a total value l@xmath81 erg s@xmath3 which is smaller than the total flux detected by our observations ( l@xmath82 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "we have used both of these values in our search of a successful model of vii zw403 .",
    "note also that the values derived from x - ray observations are doubtful and require confirmation ( bomans , 2001 ) .",
    "vii zw403 presents various nuclear centers of star formation , each of which have managed to locally structure the ism , and thus present a number of loops or broken shells with radii @xmath75 pc .",
    "another important fact is that available observations display neither an hi nor an hii or x - ray large - scale shell surrounding the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "this fact can be ascribed to a remnant evolving along its quasi - adiabatic phase , or to a neutral hydrogen shell brightness that falls below the detection limit .",
    "all considered models assume that the observed hi mass occupies a smooth low density disc - halo distribution , although an important fraction of it ( @xmath83 ) is in a dense cloud component .",
    "this has a major impact on the evolution of remnants as it affects both the time required to reach a given size , as well as the resultant x - ray luminosity produced within the superbubble .",
    "our models also assume that the ism is supported in hydrostatic equilibrium in the galaxy gravitational field by the turbulent gas pressure produced by the random gas motions with an effective velocity dispersion @xmath74 ( see tomisaka & bregman , 1993 ; silich & tenorio - tagle , 1998 ) .",
    "an example of the resultant initial ism smooth component density distribution is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the calculations were carried out with our 3d lagrangian code , which accounts for the enrichment of the hot superbubble interior by the metals ejected via supernova explosions ( silich et al .",
    "using oxygen as tracer , we derived the time dependent superbubble interior gas metalicity , which was then used in our calculations of the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "as there are no firm observational restrictions on the vii zw403 star formation timescale , we have examined different scenarios of the recent star formation activity in this galaxy .",
    "two sets of models have been considered : an instantaneous burst , and an extended star formation episode .",
    "we have associated an instantaneous burst with the 1 myr event and calculated the sb parameters following the prescriptions of section 2 . in all coeval models considered ,",
    "the energy input rate has been derived from the assumed mass of the star forming cluster . in the extended star formation scenarios we used instead the observed h@xmath0 luminosity to derived the star formation rate from our continuous star formation model ( see section 2 ) .",
    "this sfr was then transformed into a total star cluster mass and energy input rate , for the various assumed values of @xmath11 , as it was considered in section 2 .",
    "a salpeter initial mass function , with upper and lower cutoff masses 1 and 100 m@xmath5 respectively , was assumed for all models .",
    "we then calculated the time @xmath84 that superbubbles need to reach the observed 1 kpc diffuse x - ray radius .",
    "a value of @xmath84 implies an age from which one can calculate the central h@xmath0 luminosity and the integrated superbubble diffuse x - ray emission for every model .",
    "the results of the calculations for instantaneous burst models are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the various models are labeled with two separate indices that represent the logarithm of the sb mass ( also indicated in column 2 ) and the fraction of the ism assumed to be in the smooth component respectively .",
    "the preceding letter `` i '' indicates that all of these are instantaneous burst models .",
    "four different star cluster masses have been considered : @xmath85 , @xmath4 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "column 3 indicates the fraction of the ism mass assumed to be stored in clouds .",
    "the calculated dynamical time @xmath84 is presented in column 4 . after this time",
    "the shock wave has expanded to 1kpc radius , and the relevant parameters from the model can be compared with the observed values . the calculated number of @xmath46 photons , the h@xmath0 luminosity ( under assumption that all @xmath46 photons are trapped within a sb region ) , and the resultant superbubble diffuse x - ray luminosity , are presented in columns 5 , 6 and 7 respectively .",
    "column 8 indicates whether the superbubbles evolve along a quasi - adiabatic track ( a ) , or have made a transition to a radiative phase ( r ) before reaching the 1 kpc radius .",
    "the two possible modes of expansion imply different properties for the swept - up matter : either material is still too hot to radiate effectively and thus occupies the outer 20% of the remnant volume , or it has collapsed into a thin and cold outer shell , while being exposed to the ionizing radiation .",
    "the second set of models assumes an extended phase of star formation .",
    "the results of the calculations for these models are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the various models are labeled again with two separate indices that now represent the star formation time @xmath11 ( in myr ) and the fraction of the ism in the smooth component .",
    "the letter `` c '' indicates the continuous star forming mode , for which episodes lasting 5 , 10 , 20 and 40 myr have been assumed . in all these models we assumed the same sfr ( @xmath6 yr@xmath3 ) .",
    "column 2 indicates the total stellar mass , and columns 3 to 8 list the same variables considered in table 2 . in all of these models we assumed that the photons currently produced by the stellar clusters are all used up in reestablishing the ionization of the central hii region",
    "this fact is supported by the large hi mass present in vii zw403 .",
    "the resulting h@xmath0 luminosity , and the time dependent mechanical energy input rate , are shown in figures 4a and b respectively .",
    "table 2 shows that both low ( 10@xmath88 ) and high ( @xmath87 ) mass sb models are completely inconsistent with the vii zw403 parameters derived from lynds et al .",
    "( 1998 ) data .",
    "indeed , the low mass models lead to a very slow expansion speed , which makes them reach the 1kpc size only after 10 myr , even in the lowest density case with a cloud mass filling factor f@xmath89 = 90% of the observed hi mass . after this time",
    "the most massive stars have left the main sequence and exploded as supernovae , causing a fast drop in the number of emitted @xmath46 photons and consequently in the h@xmath0 luminosity of the associated hii region .",
    "this luminosity in all low sb mass cases is several orders of magnitude below the currently observed value .",
    "the high mass models on the other hand , are too energetic , produce an exceedingly high x - ray emission , and an overwhelming @xmath46 photons flux when the superbubble radius reaches 1kpc .    the intermediate mass sbs ( @xmath90 )",
    "are in better agreement with observations . however , for the emitted number of @xmath46 photons to be consistent with the value derived from the observed h@xmath0 luminosity , the smooth component of the ism has to contain only a small ( @xmath91 ) fraction of the observed hi mass .",
    "the shock wave blown by coherent sn explosions into this low density medium remains adiabatic when it reaches a 1 kpc radius ( see table 2 ) .",
    "therefore , in these models ( i5.7_5 , i6.0_5 ) an essential fraction of the x - ray emission ( @xmath92 in the model i5.7_5 and @xmath93 in the model i6.0_5 ) arises from the outer adiabatic shell of swept - up matter that should occupy the outer @xmath94 of the remnant volume .",
    "however , this is not resolved in the available x - ray maps .    from the results in table 3 ,",
    "it is clear that for a reasonable agreement between the observed parameters of vii zw403 and a continuous star formation scenario , the episode of star formation should last no less than the dynamical time required for the superbubble to reach the 1 kpc radius .",
    "the best continuous star - forming model ( c40_70 ) , with a sfr = @xmath6 yr@xmath3 , @xmath95 myr , and 30% of the total ism mass in the dense cloud component , requires about 35 myr for the outer shock to reach a radius @xmath62 1 kpc . in this model",
    "an extended gaseous halo can not completely prevent gas loss from the galaxy and allows a final shell speed slightly in excess of the escape velocity .",
    "the h@xmath0 luminosity is not an issue in this case as it is exactly the amount used to derive the constant sfr .",
    "the time evolution of the superbubble diffuse x - ray emission is shown in figure 5 for different ism models .",
    "initially the x - ray luminosity grows rapidly with time , following the energy input rate and mean hot gas metalicity time evolution .",
    "it reaches a maximum value after 10 - 20 myrs , and then remains almost constant up to the end of the star forming activity .",
    "the maximum x - ray luminosity is larger in models with a larger smooth ism component , and matches the value observed in vii zw403 when the smooth component of the ism amounts to 70% of the observed hi mass .",
    "note that we stopped our calculations when the shock fronts reached the assumed galactic ism cut - off position ( 1.9 kpc ) .",
    "this causes the breaks in the x - ray curves around 30 myr and 50 myr , for the f@xmath96 and f@xmath97 models respectively .",
    "note that for these moderate ism densities and the relevant mechanical luminosities ( see figure 4b ) , the shell of swept - up matter becomes radiative after a short time @xmath98 yr ( mac low & mccray , 1988 ) .",
    "however , this is not detected in the available hi maps .",
    "one can then claim that the large - scale shell is photo - ionized by radiation escaping the central hii region , and thus it should be most easily observed in h@xmath0 light .",
    "however , note that if @xmath92 of the @xmath46 photon flux is being used to ionize gas around the central star clusters , as it is assumed to be for the totality of clusters 1 and 2 in vii zw403 ( lynds et al . , 1998 ) , then the rest of the photons ( n@xmath99 s@xmath100 s@xmath3 ) would be free to ionize the outer ism .",
    "if the number of @xmath46 photons trapped within the neutral smooth component is negligible , they will ionize the neutral outer shell .",
    "such a shell would appear as a 1 kpc diffuse h@xmath0 emitting feature with brightness @xmath101 where @xmath102 arcsec is the averaged seeing .",
    "however , this is below our detection limit ( @xmath103 ) , and thus the h@xmath0 emission excess expected at the bubble outer shell is unlikely to be detected .",
    "approximately an order of magnitude better sensitivity has to be reached to confirm this possible model .",
    "so far it appears that the remnants caused by the two completely different recent star - forming histories considered here are able to explain the observables in vii zw403 . in all of our models however , we have also calculated the time dependent mixing of the metals freshly ejected by supernovae with the matter thermally evaporated from the outer shell .",
    "figure 6 shows the time evolution of the mean inner gas metalicity ( using oxygen as a tracer , see silich et al .",
    "2001 ) predicted for the superbubbles in the two extreme cases able to match the observations of vii zw403 .",
    "both cases show a superbubble interior metalicity largely different to that of the ism detected in the optical regime ( z@xmath104 , see table 1 ) .",
    "enormous differences are found in the coeval case which rapidly acquires several times z@xmath5 . on the other hand , the continuous star formation , although presenting high metalicity values , never surpasses z@xmath5 .",
    "this result could be used as a discriminator able to discard various possible recent histories of star formation in vii zw403 . however , as it is likely that the swept - up matter in the shell preserves the same metalicity as the unperturbed ism ( see tenorio - tagle , 1996 ) , it will be difficult to distinguish between the metalicities of two overlaid x - ray components in the instantaneous burst case .",
    "a close comparison of the hst observations and our data however has led us to realize that , although @xmath46 photons may escape their production centers and hii regions causing the extended diffuse ionized gas , the mechanical energy from the various star - forming centers has not had sufficient time to drive a large - scale remnant .",
    "this has not happened , despite the 5 - 10 myr of evolution of the various subgroups in the galactic nucleus .",
    "it seems that the five star - forming centers are sufficiently distant from each other , that their mechanical energy is still currently being used to build up individual local shells .",
    "the largest h@xmath0 shell around star cluster 4 with a radius @xmath62 250 pc is not yet enclosing , and not even in contact with the hii regions and smaller shells produced by the other star forming centers present in the galaxy .",
    "this structure thus invalidates the assumption often made , that a given mechanical luminosity derived from the h@xmath0 luminosity of a galaxy can be directly used in theoretical models as acting upon a smooth medium from the start of the calculation .",
    "vii zw403 is clearly indicating that there may be an important leakage of @xmath46 photons out from the centers of star formation , causing an extended diffuse ionized region around a starburst .",
    "however , for the mechanical energy of the various well separated centers of star formation to start working together in the production of a large - scale remnant , a longer time scale is required .",
    "a sufficient period needs to allow for the multiple shock waves to merge and overlap with each other , clearly implying a longer time the larger the separation between subgroups and the denser the ism may be around the various star - forming centers .",
    "this time scale is particularly relevant when one tries to match the remnants produced by the stellar activity in a badly ( spatially ) resolved or distant galaxy , for which one can nevertheless derive a good estimate of its h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "if for example one will ignore the detailed structure of the ionized gas in the vii zw403 and use the mechanical energy input rate derived directly from the total h@xmath0 luminosity , then little difference will be found between the coeval and the continuous star formation models . to fit simultaneously the larger h@xmath0 luminosity ( @xmath105 erg s@xmath3 ) and the x - ray luminosity derived from the pspc data",
    ", both models would require very similar star cluster masses @xmath106 m@xmath5 , a similar ism structure with a large cloud mass filling factor ( @xmath107 ) , and a similar superbubble dynamical age ( 5 - 8 myr ) .",
    "in both cases the expanding shell would remain adiabatic when the remnant reaches the 1 kpc radius .",
    "that is , if one takes the total h@xmath0 luminosity to derive the mechanical energy input rate and the bubble time evolution without knowing the ionized gas spatial distribution , one would predict a very powerful and young remnant .",
    "the delay caused by depositing the derived total mechanical luminosity locally into the different knots , clearly changes the outcome .",
    "nevertheless , the high level of energy deposition ( l@xmath108 erg s@xmath3 ) predicts ( see silich & tenorio - tagle , 2001 ) that the ism of vii zw403 will be blown away after a few tens of myrs .",
    "this leads to another possible interpretation of the observed x - ray emission , that is coming from the local bubbles generated by the various stellar subgroups .",
    "take for example the ob associations 1 and 4 for which we know the total stellar mass , the ionizing flux , the age , and the local bubble radius . from these we have derived both analytic ( chu & mac low , 1990 ) , and numerical ( silich et al . , 2001 )",
    "estimates of the present bubble x - ray luminosity .",
    "note that local bubble kinematic ages estimated from the h@xmath0 radii and expansion velocities ( @xmath109 myr ) are much smaller than the stellar cluster ages derived from the massive star isochrones , which are 4 - 6 myrs ( lynds et al .",
    "this discrepancy is often observed in the lmc bubbles ( oey & smedley , 1998 ) , and most probably is related to the recent bubble blowout from the host molecular cloud ( silich & franco , 1999 ) . we have assumed a mean stellar cluster age ( 5 myrs ) as a better indicator of the bubble time evolution .",
    "one can then estimate the x - ray emission from the local bubbles if the energy input rate and the surrounding gas density n@xmath89 are known : @xmath110 where z is the hot x - ray emitting gas metalicity , i@xmath111 is a dimensionless integral whose value is close to unity , the energy input rate l@xmath112 , and the evolutionary time t@xmath113 , measured in @xmath114 erg s@xmath3 and @xmath87 yr units respectively .",
    "we derive the appropriate star cluster mass , and its mechanical luminosity from our sb model , and use them to estimate the surrounding gas density from the standard ( weaver et al . 1977 ) bubble model : @xmath115 these results were compared ( see table 4 ) with the numerical calculations assuming a time - dependent mechanical energy input rate and time - dependent hot gas metalicity .",
    "note that the inferred x - ray luminosities show a good agreement with the observations .",
    "the large differences between the numerical and analytical estimations of the surrounding gas density results from the different mechanical energy input rates ( a constant value for analytical models and increasing with time rate for numerical calculations ) .",
    "here we have discussed the recent history of star formation and a possible nature of the diffuse x - ray emission in the nearby bcd galaxy vii zw403 .",
    "two possible scenarios of star formation have been considered : an instantaneous burst , and an extended episode of star formation .    to construct the numerical model we have provided new narrow - band observations of vii zw403 centered on the h@xmath0 line with a long exposure time corresponding to the threshold h@xmath0 flux @xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "these observations reveal a variety of ionized filaments and incomplete shells superimposed on the diffuse h@xmath0 emission that most certainly result from the photons leaking out of the main star - forming centers .",
    "the largest feature is the 250 pc broken shell associated with stellar association 4 .",
    "the total h@xmath0 luminosity derived from our observations , l@xmath116 erg s@xmath3 , is much larger than reported before .",
    "this has a profound impact on the predicted properties of the starburst blown superbubble .",
    "the numerical models based on the hst h@xmath0 data require either an instantaneous burst of star formation with a total mass of @xmath4 m@xmath5 , or a star formation episode with a constant sfr = @xmath6 m@xmath5 yr@xmath3 lasting 35 myr .",
    "the models however require radically different structures of the galactic ism and imply very different properties of the resulting remnant .",
    "the best coeval model assumes most of the ism to be locked up within high density clouds , and only @xmath91 of the observed neutral hydrogen mass is in the smooth component .",
    "the hydrodynamical calculations also predict the outer shell to be adiabatic after reaching a 1 kpc radius , and to contribute 50 - 80% of the observed diffuse x - ray emission . the bubble evolutionary time is estimated to be @xmath117 myr when its expansion speed is @xmath118 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the best continuous star formation model requires of much higher density in the smooth ism component , with only @xmath119 of the hi mass concentrated in dense clouds .",
    "this leads to a much smaller bubble expansion velocity ( v@xmath120 km s@xmath3 ) , larger evolutionary time ( @xmath121 myr ) , and a rapid cooling within the outer shell .",
    "that is , this model predicts a low brightness hi shell surrounding the diffuse 1 kpc x - ray region .",
    "this shell may also show up in @xmath122 if exposed to the @xmath46 flux from the central cluster .",
    "the inner gas metalicities are also predicted to be very different in these two cases .",
    "the numerical calculations based on the high energy input rate derived from our observations require an instantaneous burst or a short episode of star formation with sfr @xmath123 m@xmath5 yr@xmath3 lasting less than 10 myr with similar total stellar cluster masses @xmath106 m@xmath5 and most of the ism ( @xmath107 ) locked up within high density clouds .",
    "the comparison of the energy input rate derived from our @xmath122 data with the theoretical limits , implies that the entire ism and metals produced by the current episode of star formation are going to be ejected from the galaxy after the coherent superbubble is formed .",
    "it appears that the five main star - forming knots are sufficiently distant to form a coherent shell in a short time scale , while keeping their energies blocked within local , spatially separated bubbles .",
    "this provides a time delay that must be considered when developing a numerical model for the coherent superbubble driven by a number of young stellar clusters .",
    "numerical calculations show that the x - ray luminosities from young local bubbles are in a good agreement with the rosat pspc data .",
    "this agreement indicates that the observed diffuse component of the x - ray emission may be related to the small centrally concentrated bubbles , rather than to the coherent 1 kpc structure .",
    "further observations with the xmm - newton observatory is expected to be able to recover the real nature of the diffuse x - ray emission and the recent history of star formation in this galaxy .",
    "we thank d. bomans for his comments and suggestions regarding the x - ray data .",
