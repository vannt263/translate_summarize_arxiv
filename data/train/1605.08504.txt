    "topological string - like vortex solutions have been the subject of intense studies in field theory and cosmology since the discovery of the nielsen - olesen ( no ) string in the abelian higgs model @xcite .",
    "their existence is closely connected to the spontaneous breaking of the u(1 ) gauge symmetry by higgs mechanism . the string - like solutions",
    "have been shown to exist when the theory is generalized to have a global su(2 ) symmetry with a scalar doublet @xcite .",
    "this is interesting because this model represents the bosonic sector of the electroweak theory in the limit that the weinberg angle , @xmath2 , becomes one .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of this solution is that its stability is guaranteed without being supported by the standard topological argument related to the homotopy of the vacuum manifold . in the bogomolny - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit where the mass ratio of gauge field and the higgs become equal",
    ", there is a continuous family of solutions which are degenerate in energy @xcite .",
    "the solution space consists of either the embedded no vortices or the baby skyrmion solutions .    in recent years",
    ", new type of solutions were found in this model .",
    "these twisted  semilocal \" vortex were constructed allowing the two scalar components to have different phase factors which depend on time as well as on the coordinate corresponding to their axis of symmetry @xcite . a notable fact about the twisted vortex",
    "is that the energy away from the bps limit can be lower than the energy of the corresponding embedded no vortex .    clearly",
    "this type of vortex solutions is very interesting from the mathematical point of view .",
    "moreover , from the physical point of view they also become interesting because they have potentially important applications in various areas of physics .",
    "obviously they could play important roles in condensed matter physics , in particular in multi - gap superconductors and multi - component bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "this is because they are a natural generalization of the abrikosov vortex in ginzburg - landau model of superconductor .",
    "moreover , they may have a natural application to the skyrme theory , because the skyrme theory also has the global su(2 ) and local u(1 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "and they could play important roles in high energy physics because they could be embedded in the standard weinberg - salam model .",
    "finally , they could describe cosmic strings and become important in cosmology .",
    "so they have interesting applications in almost all areas of physics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the multiply phased vortex solutions exist when we generalize the global su(2 ) to su(n+1 ) .",
    "especially we find the multiply phased vortex solutions in the bps limit .",
    "the solutions can be obtained by dressing the traveling wave which moves along the axis of symmetry .",
    "what is remarkable in our vortex solutions is that the frequencies of traveling waves in each component of the su(n+1 ) scalar multiplet can be different , so that they are multiply phased .",
    "the energy of the static bps vortex is proportional to the topological charge of the @xmath1 model , and the multiple phase ( or the  twisting \" ) of vortex supplies additional energy contribution which is proportional to the noether charge associated to the remaining symmetry .",
    "we have analyzed this additional energy contributions in terms of known static bps solutions and electromagnetic charge density in details .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we investigate the static bps semilocal vortex solutions when the scalar field has @xmath3 components .",
    "we express all relevant equations in a gauge invariant way . in section",
    "iii we construct the multiply phased vortex solutions which have traveling waves along their axis of symmetry .",
    "we show the energy of multiply phased bps vortex can be written in terms of topological charge of @xmath1 model and noether charge . in the final section",
    "we discuss the physical implications of our results . in this paper",
    "we use the metric where @xmath4 .",
    "the so - called  semi - local \" string appears naturally in models involving multiply charged complex scalar fields coupled to electromagnetism which has a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "they were introduced as a minimal extension of the abelian higgs model with the familiar topologically stable nielsen - olesen vortex .    in this extended model , the abelian gauge field couples to a complex higgs doublet so that in addition to local u(1 ) symmetry , there is an extra su(2 ) global symmetry , which is spontaneously broken to a global u(1 ) . according to the popular wisdom the trivial first homotopy of vacuum manifold (",
    "i.e. , @xmath5 ) rejects the existence of topological vortex , but when the scalar field at the spatial infinity lies on a gauge orbit or a circle lying in the vacuum manifold , the gradient energy of scalar field could have a finite value and thus the theory could support finite energy solitons .",
    "this leads to u(1 ) vortex solutions even though the vacuum manifold is simply connected .",
    "they have important applications in cosmology , multi - component superconductor in condensed matter physics @xcite , and in two - component plasma physics @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that the semilocal vortex can carry persistent longitudinal currents associated with the global symmetry subgroup @xcite .",
    "our primary interest in the model is these properties of bps semilocal vortex solutions .",
    "we found that it is possible to have a vortex with traveling wave whose frequencies are all different when the scalar field has more than two components .",
    "consider the extended abelian higgs model in which an su(n+1 ) multiplet scalar field @xmath6 is coupled to the abelian gauge field @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the abelian field strength .",
    "the lagrangian possesses the local u(1 ) gauge symmetry , being invariant under the transformations , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an an infinitesimal parameter .",
    "moreover , it has the global su(n+1 ) symmetry @xmath13 , where @xmath14 are the generators of su(n+1 ) in the fundamental representation , and @xmath15 are constant infinitesimal parameters .",
    "when the scalar get a vacuum expectation values @xmath16 the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken . in the symmetry broken phase ,",
    "the particle spectrum consists of a massive vector field with mass @xmath17 , and of scalar higgs with mass @xmath18 .",
    "the remainings of the particle spectrum are @xmath19-massless goldstone bosons . for convenience we will rescale the fields so that all variables become dimensionless , @xmath20 in the following .",
    "introducing @xmath21 field @xmath22 , @xmath23 the lagrangian ( [ lag1 ] ) can be written as @xmath24 where now the covariant derivative becomes @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in terms of @xmath27 and",

    "which is gauge invariant we can express our equations in a gauge independent way .",
    "since @xmath33 we can rewrite the lagrangian in terms of gauge invariant quantities @xcite , @xmath34 the equations of motion are then given as @xmath35 the energy momentum tensor can be obtained varying the lagrangian with respect to the metric tensor @xmath36 , @xmath37    it is well - known that this model with scalar doublet can have finite energy ( per unit length ) vortex solutions called the semilocal vortices .",
    "some of the solutions in this model are just those obtained from the nielsen - olesen solutions identifying , say , the upper component of @xmath38 with the scalar field in the nielsen - olesen model .",
    "but there are different kinds of solutions . especially , at the critical coupling there exist a solution which appears to describe a hybrid of a no vortex and @xmath39 lump in addition to the embedded no solution @xcite .",

    "this defines the bogomolny limit in the abelian higgs model @xcite .    in order to show the bogomolny limit in the current model",

    "the energy of vortex can be written as @xmath50 from the last expression , we secure the bogomolny bound @xmath51 since the we can choose upper sign or lower sign in ( [ eng2 ] ) , depending on the sign of the flux @xmath52 . for a given value of @xmath52 , this bound is saturated if and only if the fields satisfy the self - duality equations @xmath53 any solution to the first order self - duality equations automatically satisfy the original static field equations . in what follows",
    "we shall focus on vortex solutions ( the upper sign ) without loss of the generality .",
    "let us now discuss about the nature of these self - dual soliton solutions .",
    "the last two equations ( [ currenteq ] ) and ( [ mageq ] ) can be combined to give a single second order differential equation @xmath54 note that the topological charge of @xmath1 model is defined by @xmath55 for an embedded no vortex solution the scalar field @xmath27 should vanish at the location of vortex in order to have well defined phase . in this case",

    "if the wave were traveling down along the @xmath95-axis , then we should have @xmath109 .",
    "both the cases satisfy the relation @xmath110 .",
    "this implies that there is a longitudinal electric current @xmath111 carried by traveling waves and the region with nonvanishing current is electrically charged .    from ( [ aeq ] )",
    "we can see that the charge density @xmath103 is governed by the following equation , @xmath112 the second term can be expressed in terms of @xmath76 explicitly : @xmath113 thus with the solution of ( [ heq2 ] ) we can solve eq .",
    "( [ j0eq ] ) in principle .",
    "if all traveling waves have the same frequency , it will give a much simpler vortex solution .",
    "for generality , we will discuss solutions in which each traveling wave in the @xmath69-th @xmath1 component has a distinct frequency .",
    "note , the left hand side of ( [ j0eq ] ) can be written @xmath114 integrating both sides of this over the transverse plane gives vanishing net charge per unit vortex length , @xmath115 this also implies the vanishment of net longitudinal current because of the relation @xmath116 .",

    "this shows that the energy of a twisted bps vortex of the type ( [ twistsol1 ] ) depends on the global noether charges in addition to the topological charge , @xmath135 this is unlike the case of untwisted semilocal vortex where the bogomolny bound is given in terms of the topological charge only .",
    "let us now discuss the topological properties of the @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath136 can be into three parts as have done in ref .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the second contribution is given by @xmath149 which can be evaluated if a explicit form of @xmath76 were given .",
    "this integral is also proportional to @xmath145 if all frequencies of waves are equal to @xmath150 .",
    "remaining contribution to energy can be written as @xmath151 where we used the relation ( [ emcurrent ] ) . again",
    "if all traveling waves has the same frequency @xmath150 , then one can notice from eq .",
    "( [ j0eq ] ) that @xmath152 is proportional to @xmath150 .",
    "this implies that @xmath153 is proportional to @xmath150 and the last integral is proportional to @xmath145 . thus twisting the bps semilocal vortex gives additional energy contributions which depend on the frequencies @xmath154 as well as topological charge @xmath155 : @xmath156    since the ansatz ( [ twistsol1 ] ) moves along the gauge orbit of the unbroken global @xmath157 as one moves along the @xmath95 axis , @xmath158",
    ", we expect the translational symmetry along @xmath95 axis .",
    "consequently a twisted vortex should carry the conserved longitudinal momentum @xmath159 indeed , it can be written in terms of the noether charges as the corresponding conserved longitudinal momentum ( per unit length ) @xmath160 carried by a twisted vortex also can be expressed in terms of noether charges , @xmath161 imposing the rotational symmetry to the twisting vortex solutions the conserved angular momentum of the vortex will be also conserved .    since the gauge field of our ansatz",
    "has has no @xmath95 axis and the @xmath95 dependent phases in scalar field are compensated by a gauge transformation , the solution has a translation invariance along @xmath95 axis .",
    "the associated conserved momentum ( per unit length ) is given by @xmath162    our twisting solution has the nontrivial longitudinal current density flowing through any transverse plane of the vortex . integrating the eq .",
    "( [ j0eq ] ) over the @xmath40 plane shows that total current , and total charge density per unit vortex length are both zero , @xmath163",
    "in this paper we have presented twisted bps vortex solutions in the extended abelian higgs model where the scalar field is in the fundamental representation of su(n+1 ) group .",
