    "the present paper addresses some aspects of theoretical treatment of collective excitations of a hot nucleus within the thermo field dynamics ( tfd ) .",
    "the tfd@xcite is known as a powerful tool in studying many - body problems at finite temperatures . there",
    "exist numerous tfd applications in condensed matter and high energy physics ( see e.g.@xcite ) . in spite of several attractive properties the tfd formalism seems to be less popular in the nuclear theorist community . during the last 20 years only a dozen works dealing with the tfd application to nuclear structure problems",
    "were published.@xcite    an important step in application of the tfd formalism for extending the standard nuclear theory methods ( the hfb approximation , rpa , a boson expansion technique ) to finite temperatures was made by t.  hatsuda.@xcite in,@xcite different approximations going beyond the thermal rpa were formulated .",
    "o.  civitarese and coauthors@xcite applied the tfd to problems of treating nuclear pairing in the bcs and the random phase approximations as well as quasi - continuum ( or resonant ) single - particle states at finite temperatures .",
    "moreover , the tfd was used to prove the bloch - messiah theorem at finite temperatures@xcite and construct number - projection methods for the bcs pairing in hot nuclei.@xcite    the methods and approximations developed in the papers cited above were not applied to numerical calculations of any nuclear properties .",
    "only simple solvable models were used to demonstrate the new achievements . at the same time , in@xcite the tfd was combined with the quasiparticle - phonon nuclear model ( qpm)@xcite to formulate an approach allowing one to treat microscopically a coupling of different excitation modes in hot nuclei .",
    "this coupling is known to be responsible for the spreading width of giant resonances in cold spherical nuclei , and the tfd - qpm approach was used to analyze a thermal behavior of a giant dipole resonance width.@xcite    it appeared that in contrast with earlier studies of the problem@xcite ( see also@xcite ) based on the matsubara green function technique and the nuclear field theory,@xcite the quasiparticle - phonon interaction at finite temperature in the tfd - qpm approach did not depend on the thermal occupation numbers of phonons .",
    "only the fermi - dirac thermal occupation numbers of noninteracting bcs quasiparticles appeared in corresponding formulae of refs.@xcite some aspects of this difference were discussed in@xcite ( see also@xcite ) .",
    "recently , studying weak transitions of the gamow - teller type in hot nuclei@xcite within the tfd we found some inconsistencies in the tfd - qpm approach of@xcite related to structures of thermal vibrational phonons .",
    "moreover , new points in the tfd - qpm approach appear if one adopts changes in the tfd formulation proposed by izumi ojima@xcite that concern the alternative formulation of the double tilde conjugation rule .",
    "the reasons given above compel us to reexamine the tfd - qpm approach of@xcite to a quasiparticle - phonon coupling at finite temperatures .",
    "this is the main aim of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "a brief summary of the tfd formalism is given in sec .",
    "[ tfd_formalism ] .",
    "this seems to be necessary because we use here a variant of the theory which somewhat differs from the standard one.@xcite in sec .  [ main ] ,",
    "the tfd formalism is applied to the nuclear hamiltonian consisting of a mean field , the bcs pairing interaction and separable particle - hole forces , i.e. , to the qpm hamiltonian.@xcite in subsec .",
    "[ qp_approx ] , the thermal bcs pairing is considered .",
    "this part of the paper is close to that of,@xcite a discussion of @xmath0-transitions between a thermal vacuum state and thermal quasiparticle excitations is the only addition . in subsec .",
    "[ rpa_approx ] , the equations of the thermal random phase approximation ( trpa ) are derived .",
    "it is shown why and how the thermal bose - einstein occupation factors should appear in the expressions for thermal quasiparticle amplitudes of a thermal phonon wave function .",
    "the points missed in@xcite are analyzed and discussed .",
    "the new formulae of the quasiparticle - phonon coupling term at finite temperature are evaluated in subsec .",
    "[ high_approx ] .",
    "the summary and conclusions are given in sec.[concl ] .",
    "we consider a system of fermi particles at finite temperature and treat its statistical properties within the grand canonical ensemble . in the standard statistical mechanics",
    "a heated system is described by a mixed state density matrix @xmath1 which is the solution to the liouville - von  neumann equation @xmath2.\\ ] ] here @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of the system under consideration with eigenstates @xmath4 and eigenvalues @xmath5 ( the chemical potential is included in @xmath3 ) .",
    "the thermal average of an arbitrary operator @xmath6 is given by @xmath7/{\\rm tr}[\\rho]= \\sum_n { \\rm e}^{-e_n / t}\\langle n|a|n\\rangle \\bigl/ \\sum_n { \\rm e}^{-e_n / t},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the temperature in units of energy .",
    "the main idea behind tfd is to define a special state which is named a thermal vacuum @xmath9 , such that the thermal average of @xmath6 equals the expectation value of @xmath6 with respect to this state @xmath10    to construct @xmath9 , one should double the hilbert space of the system by adding the so - called tilde states @xmath11.@xcite these tilde - states are the eigenstates of the tilde hamiltonian @xmath12 with the same eigenvalues as @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the hilbert space of a heated system is twice as large as of the corresponding initial ( cold ) one .    in the enlarged space covered by the states @xmath14 two types of operators are acting  the ordinary ,",
    "say , @xmath15 and the tilde ones @xmath16 .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between these two sets @xmath17 .",
    "however , ordinary operators can change only ordinary states @xmath4 whereas tilde operators change only tilde - states @xmath18 .",
    "there exist the following rules of tilde conjugation operation:@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 are @xmath22-numbers .",
    "the asterisk denotes the complex conjugation .",
    "the tilde operation is supposed to commute with the hermitian conjugation @xmath23 moreover , it is required that ordinary- and tilde - operators should commute or anticommute with each other @xmath24_{\\mp}=0\\ ] ] depending on their bosonic or fermionic nature .",
    "introduction of the doubled hilbert space of a heated system enables one to construct the above thermal vacuum @xmath9 in the following way : @xmath25 hereafter , the thermal vacuum ( [ t_vac ] ) will be referred to as the exact thermal vacuum .",
    "the thermal vacuum is invariant under the tilde operation .",
    "till now our discussion follows the line of.@xcite the new point appears in the definition of the so - called double tilde conjugation rule ( dtcr ) .",
    "originally,@xcite dtcr was introduced in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 if @xmath6 is a bosonic operator and @xmath28 if @xmath6 is a fermionic one .",
    "this dtcr form was used in all of the tfd applications to nuclear structure problems , i.e. , in .",
    "@xcite however , quite long ago the other form of dtcr was proposed by i.  ojima,@xcite namely , @xmath29 that is , the ojima s version of dtcr does not distinguish between bosonic and fermionic operators .",
    "this form is based on the equivalence between the algebraic structure of tfd and that of the axiomatic statistical mechanics ( @xmath30-algebra approach ) established by i.  ojima . in the present paper",
    ", we will compare consequences of using the two dtcr versions .",
    "for that we define dtcr for a fermionic @xmath6 in the following way : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is equal to either 1 ( @xmath33 ) or @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "thus , the dtcr definition ( [ dtc_rule ] ) includes both the above dtcr variants .",
    "the schrdinger equation for a hot system in the doubled hilbert space reads @xmath36 since @xmath37 is the time - translation operator and , therefore , the hamiltonian of a hot system .",
    "the operator @xmath38 is named the thermal hamiltonian.@xcite the exact thermal vacuum ( [ t_vac ] ) is the eigenstate of @xmath39 corresponding to the zero eigenvalue .",
    "equation  ( [ shr ] ) describes the time evolution of a system at finite temperature and , thus , is the analog of the liouville - von  neumann equation  ( [ liouville ] ) .",
    "the properties of elementary excitations of the system at @xmath40 are determined by @xmath41 .",
    "excitation energies of various modes at @xmath42 are the eigenvalues of @xmath41 but not of the original hamiltonian @xmath3 and in general they depend on @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , any eigenstate of @xmath43 with positive energy has its counterpart  the tilde - conjugate eigenstate with negative energy .",
    "following h.  umezawa we consider creation of a tilde - state with negative energy as annihilation of a thermally excited state .",
    "this is a way to treat excitation and de - excitation processes in a heated quantum system within tfd .",
    "whereas the dynamical development of the system is carried by the thermal hamiltonian , its thermal behaviour is controlled by the thermal vacuum .",
    "the grand canonical value of an observable corresponding to operator @xmath6 should be calculated as @xmath44 , i.e. , after diagonalizing @xmath38 .",
    "obviously , in most cases one can not diagonalize @xmath38 exactly and , thus , find the exact thermal vacuum and other eigenstates .",
    "usually , one resorts to some approximations and then finds an approximate thermal vacuum state , e.g. , the thermal vacua corresponding to the hfb or the random phase approximations . in the case",
    "that there appear several solutions in the given approximation , one should find the minimum of thermodynamical potential @xmath45 to see which of them is realized . in tfd , @xmath45 is given as@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the approximate thermal vacuum and @xmath48 is the entropy operator of the system .",
    "in what follows we will use the microscopic hamiltonian of the quasiparticle - phonon nuclear model@xcite @xmath49 the hamiltonian ( [ qpm_zero ] ) includes average fields of protons and neutrons @xmath50 pairing interactions of the bcs type @xmath51 and effective multipole - multipole isoscalar and isovector forces @xmath52 the single - particle operator @xmath53 reads @xmath54 here , an operator @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of nucleon in a single - particle subshell with quantum numbers @xmath57 and energy @xmath58 ; index @xmath59 is the isotopic one , changing the sign of @xmath60 means the interchange @xmath61 , the notation @xmath62 implies a summation over neutron ( @xmath63 ) or proton ( @xmath64 ) single - particle states only . the parameter @xmath65 is the proton - proton or neutron - neutron pairing interaction constant ; @xmath66 is the radial form factor of the @xmath67-pole separable interaction , @xmath68 is the corresponding spherical harmonic , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the coupling constants of isoscalar and isovector multipole - multipole interactions of @xmath67 multipolarity .",
    "the value @xmath71 is the neutron or proton chemical potential ( the fermi level ) .    to find an excitation spectrum of a hot nucleus governed by the qpm hamiltonian ( [ qpm_zero ] ) , at the beginning we should construct the thermal qpm hamiltonian @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the tilde counterpart of @xmath75 created by the tilde conjugation rules  ( [ tc_rule ] ) .",
    "then we should diagonalize @xmath76 .",
    "this procedure is quite similar to that used in the standard qpm,@xcite i.e. , at @xmath77 .",
    "the main difference lies in the doubled hilbert space of a heated nucleus .",
    "the first step is diagonalization of part of the full thermal hamiltonian , namely the sum of the two first terms @xmath78 which in the following will be referred to as the thermal bcs hamiltonian @xmath79 . to this aim",
    ", we make the bogoliubov @xmath80- transformation from nucleon operators @xmath81 to quasiparticle operators @xmath82 @xmath83 the same transformation with the same @xmath80 coefficients has to be applied to nucleonic tilde operators @xmath84 , thus producing the tilde quasiparticle operators @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "thermal effects appear after the second ( or thermal ) bogoliubov transformation which mixes ordinary and tilde quasiparticle operators and , thus , produces the operators of so - called thermal quasiparticles @xmath87 and their tilde counterparts @xmath88 note that in contrast with refs.@xcite and many others we include the factor @xmath32 from the definition of dtcr ( [ dtc_rule ] ) to the thermal bogoliubov transformation ( [ t_tr ] ) .    to find the coefficients @xmath89 , we express the thermal hamiltonian in terms of thermal quasiparticle operators ( [ t_tr ] ) and then require that the one - body part of the thermal bcs hamiltonian has to be diagonal in terms of thermal quasiparticles .",
    "this leads to the following equations for the @xmath90 coefficients : @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "the gap parameter @xmath93 and the chemical potential @xmath71 are the solutions of the equations @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of neutrons or protons in a nucleus . actually , the equation for @xmath95 is not a consequence of the procedure described above but rather an additional demand that a number of particles of any kind in the heated system is conserved in average .",
    "with @xmath96 from ( [ uv ] ) the one - body part of the thermal bcs hamiltonian reads @xmath97 thus , @xmath79 describes a system of noninteracting thermal quasiparticles and tilde - quasiparticles with energies @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "the vacuum for thermal quasiparticles is given by@xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the vacua for ordinary and tilde bogoliubov quasiparticles , respectively .",
    "the operator @xmath103 is the entropy operator .",
    "it reads @xmath104    we should stress that although the vacuum ( [ tqp_vacuum ] ) is the eigenstate of the thermal bcs hamiltonian ( [ ht_sp ] ) with zero eigenvalue it is not yet a thermal vacuum state in the sense of ( [ exp_val ] ) . to determine the thermal vacuum state corresponding to @xmath79 we need to fix appropriately the coefficients @xmath105 .",
    "they can be found by minimizing the thermodynamic potential @xmath106 note that @xmath107 contains the ordinary operators @xmath108 and @xmath109 but not the thermal ones @xmath110 and @xmath111 . as a result of variational procedure , we obtain @xmath112^{-1/2}~ ,    \\quad x_j=\\bigl(1-y^2_j\\bigr)^{1/2}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , the coefficients @xmath113 are nothing else than the thermal occupation factors of the fermi - dirac statistics .    the thermal quasiparticle vacuum ( [ tqp_vacuum ] ) with the coefficients @xmath114 ( [ occup ] ) is the thermal vacuum in the thermal bcs approximation",
    "hereafter , it will be denoted by @xmath115 .",
    "the average number of thermally excited bogoliubov quasiparticles with quantum numbers @xmath116 in the bcs thermal vacuum @xmath117 is @xmath118 whereas the average number of nucleons in the same state is @xmath119 the function @xmath120 determines smearing of the fermi surface due to thermal and pairing effects",
    ".    equations ( [ bcs ] ) with @xmath114 ( [ occup ] ) are the well - known bcs - equations at finite temperature ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "since the thermal vacuum @xmath115 contains a certain number of bogoliubov quasiparticles , the excited states at finite temperature can be built on the top of @xmath117 by either adding or eliminating a bogoliubov quasiparticle . due to the relations",

    ". they also can be obtained from ( [ system2 ] ) and ( [ det ] ) by changing the sign of @xmath291 .",
    "that is if @xmath291 is the energy of a given state @xmath294 , then @xmath295 is the energy of the tilde - conjugated state @xmath296 .",
    "certainly , the above results deviate from those of.@xcite due to the changes of thermal rpa - phonon amplitudes and , in particular , their dependence on the thermal phonon occupation numbers , the quasiparticle - phonon interaction ( [ th_ham3 ] ) couples one - phonon states with three types of thermal two - phonon states whereas in@xcite only one type was taken into account ( namely , the first term in ( [ trial ] ) .",
    "the terms @xmath297 in the trial wave function describe the processes which were not considered in@xcite and later in.@xcite the processes of thermal phonon scattering and absorption became possible due to the presence of thermal r - phonons in the thermal phonon vacuum . since in@xcite the thermal quasiparticle - phonon interaction was treated on the basis of thermal vacuum for r - phonons , the above effects were missed .",
    "the inclusion of the terms @xmath297 in the trial wave function produces the new poles in the secular equation ( [ det ] ) in comparison with the previous study,@xcite namely , @xmath298 and @xmath299 .",
    "the new equations of the tfd - qpm approach ( [ system2 ] ) and ( [ det ] ) are in qualitative agreement with those in@xcite and , in some respects , in.@xcite    as it was mentioned in the introduction , the consideration in@xcite was based on the matsubara green function technique and nuclear field theory .",
    "the approach of@xcite is especially close to our approach since it treats a hot nucleus as a system of interacting trpa phonons .",
    "although the equations of both the approaches seem to be hardly compared `` term - to - term '' because of quite different formalisms explored , in both the cases the negative trpa roots are in the game , the poles in the equations are of the same types , phonon interaction matrix elements are similar etc .",
    "that is why we can establish their `` qualitative '' agreement .",
    "the formulae for the matrix elements of @xmath129 transitions from the thermal vacuum state to the state ( [ trial ] ) and its tilde - counterpart are quite obvious . in the leading approximation the operator @xmath300 induces a transition from the thermal vacuum to one - phonon components of the thermal state @xmath287 ( or @xmath293 ) only .",
    "matrix elements of direct transitions from @xmath301 to two - phonon components are very weak although do not vanish .",
    "thus , one gets @xmath302 where @xmath303 and @xmath304 are given by ( [ ampl1 ] ) .",
    "the present study was motivated by the necessity to reexamine the tfd - qpm approach@xcite in theory of hot nuclei . in this respect ,",
    "a couple of new facets of the trpa formulated within the tfd were found and their influence on the coupling of thermal phonons was established .",
    "we showed that for the hamiltonian consisting of a mean field , the bcs pairing interaction and separable particle - hole effective interactions , amplitudes of a thermal phonon wave function ( [ phonon ] ) were not determined unambiguously by diagonalization of the rpa - part of the thermal hamiltonian .",
    "to fix the coefficients of a linear transformation from the set of thermal two - quasiparticle operators to phonon operators , one should impose an additional demand  to minimize the thermodynamic potential of the system of free thermal phonons .",
    "this was achieved by using one more unitary transformation  a thermal rotation of `` reference '' phonons ( r - phonons ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the bose - einstein thermal occupation numbers ( thermal occupation numbers of phonons ) come to play .",
    "it should be stressed that the new ingredient does not affect the main trpa equation , i.e. , the equation for thermal phonon energies .",
    "as far as we know , the thermal rotation of phonons in the trpa framework was discussed only in@xcite when treating the pairing bcs hamiltonian .",
    "the thermal rotation of phonons was missed not only in the preceding tfd - qpm studies@xcite but it was not also mentioned in.@xcite moreover , the bose - einstein thermal occupation numbers do not appear when the trpa equations are derived by exploring the phonon operator with scattering terms.@xcite    thus , according to the present results amplitudes in the thermal phonon wave function depend not only on thermal occupation numbers of bogoliubov quasiparticles making up the phonon but also on the thermal occupation numbers of the phonon .",
    "moreover , presently the corresponding thermal phonon vacuum contains some amount of r - phonons with probabilities determined by their energies in accordance with the bose statistics . due to this",
    ", the processes of excitation and deexcitation of a hot nucleus can be regarded on equal footing .",
    "the above results have weighty consequences .",
    "the first one is the appearance of the factor @xmath305 in the @xmath129 transition strength .",
    "its role was discussed in@xcite where it was derived using the green function technique ( see also@xcite ) .",
    "this factor somewhat enhances the low energy part of the @xmath129 transition strength .",
    "it is also essential when @xmath127 can take negative values , i.e. when considering a decay of a hot nucleus .",
    "the second consequence concerns the thermal quasiparticle - phonon interaction @xmath306 .",
    "this consequence is two - fold : a ) renormalization of phonon - phonon interaction vertices ( cf .",
    "matrix element @xmath281 ( [ u12 ] ) with that in@xcite ) ; b ) essential extension of the thermal two - phonon configuration space and the corresponding complication of trial wave function ( [ trial ] ) .    with the above new ingredients the tfd - qpm approach well conform ( at least qualitatively ) with a more traditional one exploring the matsubara green function method.@xcite now in both the approaches one has two kinds of thermal occupation numbers ( fermionic and bosonic ) and the identical sets of processes giving rise to the phonon - phonon coupling .",
    "in view of the above discussion , we conclude that the results of calculations in@xcite should be revised . at the same time",
    ", it should be stressed that the thermal rotation of phonons can not be regarded as a mandatory ingredient of a microscopic treatment of boson - like excitations in many fermion systems .",
    "its necessity seems to be intimately related with a two - body interaction character .",
    "for example , in refs.@xcite , some approximations going beyond the trpa were constructed by using the tfd formalism and their validity was examined by the example of the lipkin model . in those studies the transformation from thermal bifermion operators to thermal phonon operators was unambiguously determined by diagonalization of the thermal model hamiltonian . no additional demands or assumptions",
    "were needed to be involved .",
    "one more new feature of the present study is exploring the double tilde - conjugation rule in the form proposed by i.  ojima.@xcite more precisely , we found that just the ojima s formulation of dtcr guarantees the correct behaviour of the thermal phonon wave function in the limit of vanishing particle - hole interaction .",
    "furthermore , the ojima form of dtcr implies the complex thermal rotation for fermions .",
    "an interesting point is that the effect of the dtcr choice was revealed only at the trpa stage while constructing a thermal phonon operator , whereas at the pure fermionic stage when , e.g. , pairing correlations were considered , the role of dtcr did not show up in and both the versions gave the same results .",
    "the valuable discussions with dr . a. storozhenko and prof .",
    "d. kosov are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "here we display the matrix elements of the quasiparticle - phonon interaction @xmath268 between thermal one - phonon and different two - phonon configurations .",
