    "can a solid exhibit superfluidity in lattice systems ?",
    "this question was first investigated theoretically by matsuda and tsuneto  @xcite in the context of the quantum lattice - gas model for @xmath2he , which assumes that atoms move only on fixed lattice points even in the liquid phase .  @xcite using the lattice representation , they discussed the possibility of supersolidity , which is characterized by the coexistence of solid ( diagonal ) and superfluid ( off - diagonal ) long - range orders , in bulk and thin film of @xmath2he . in the lattice system ,",
    "the continuous translational invariance of the system is broken by the presence of the background discrete structure , and the `` solid '' means a state in which a discrete translational invariance is broken spontaneously .",
    "recently , this issue has attracted renewed interest in connection with ultracold bose gases in optical lattices .",
    "the creation of gases with strong dipole - dipole interactions  @xcite has provided an ingredient essential for the emergence of supersolid phases , namely long - range interactions . moreover , the precise controllability of optical - lattice systems has inspired theoretical explorations of supersolid phases in various types of lattice structure , such as chain ,  @xcite square ,  @xcite triangular ,  @xcite honeycomb ,  @xcite kagome ,  @xcite and cubic  @xcite lattices .",
    "we also note that the formation of checkerboard density - wave order has been experimentally observed in bose - einstein condensates coupled with an optical cavity .",
    "@xcite    for understanding lattice supersolids , it is important to address the following questions : in what situations the coexistent state can emerge and why it can be stable in such situations .",
    "extensive studies over the past few decades have provided answers to these questions .",
    "for example , previous researches demonstrated that no supersolid phases can exist in the ground - state phase diagram of the hardcore bose - hubbard model with the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interaction for bipartite lattices such as square  @xcite and honeycomb  @xcite lattices . in these cases ,",
    "uniform supersolid states are unstable towards the formation of domain walls ,  @xcite and the system undergoes phase separation into superfluid and solid phases . in order for supersolid phases to be present",
    ", one has to modify the model by , e.g. , introducing dipole - dipole interactions  @xcite or treating softcore bosons .",
    "@xcite in contrast , the triangular - lattice system of hardcore bosons with only the nn interaction has stable supersolid phases for the fillings @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite as for the case of the kagome lattice , although the mean - field ( mf ) analysis predicts the existence of supersolid states ,  @xcite they are destabilized by the effects of strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , focusing on the supersolid phase with checkerboard solid order , we analyze ground - state properties of hardcore bosons with long - range interactions on a square lattice by means of the linear spin - wave ( lsw ) theory and a cluster mean - field ( cmf ) method . in this system",
    ", the range of the interactions makes a qualitative difference in the emergence of checkerboard supersolid ( css ) states .",
    "the previous quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations  @xcite have shown that no css phase is present between the superfluid ( sf ) and checkerboard solid ( cs ) phases in the system with only the nn interaction @xmath4 and the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that the infinite - range dipole - dipole interaction , which decays as the inverse cube of the distance , can stabilize the css states .",
    "@xcite we will clarify the reasons why the dipole - dipole interaction can stabilize the css states unlike the case of only the nn and nnn interactions .",
    "the mf ground - state ( classical ) properties of the hardcore bose - hubbard models with dipole - dipole interaction and with only the nn and nnn interactions have already been discussed separately in previous works .",
    "@xcite we first review those results from the standpoint of comparing the two types of interactions .",
    "when assuming that the system is in the phases with checkerboard ( two - sublattice ) order , the mf energy of the dipolar model can be naturally written in the same form as that of the model with effective nn and nnn interactions , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we find that the value of @xmath8 is very large , and it leads to a large region of css phase in the ground - state phase diagram at the mf level .",
    "second , from the lsw analysis , we show that quantum fluctuations around the mf solutions are not so strong compared to the case of only the nn and nnn interactions , which is attributed to the absence of the direct competition between the checkerboard and other solid orders .",
    "these two factors lead to the emergence of the stable css state in the dipolar system unlike the case of the shorter - range interactions .    moreover , including the effects of quantum fluctuations , we derive the ground - state phase diagrams .",
    "although some of the results have already been known from previous qmc works , we reconsider the issue in detail in terms of another numerical approach based on a large - size cmf method .",
    "@xcite from a comparison with the qmc result  @xcite for the model with dipole - dipole interaction , it is shown that the cmf method combined with cluster - size scaling can locate the phase boundaries quantitatively .",
    "we also derive the phase diagram of the model with only the nn and nnn interactions and confirm that the region of stable css phase almost completely disappears due to the strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "moreover , we find the first - order phase transition between the sf and the cs ( or the css ) in the close vicinity of the particle - hole symmetry line for the both models .",
    "it is worth stressing that our cmf procedure is free from the minus - sign problem even when applying to frustrated systems .",
    "moreover , it is useful to study metastability phenomena such as hysteresis ,  @xcite since one can get all stationary points of the free energy including metastable and saddle - point solutions .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ 2 ] , we introduce our models describing hardcore bosons with two types of long - range interactions in a square lattice . in sec .  [ 3 ] , we show the ground - state phase diagrams of the two models within the mean - field theory . in sec .",
    "[ 4 ] , we perform the lsw analyses to discuss the strength of quantum fluctuations around the mf solutions . in sec .  [ 5 ] , applying a cmf method and the cluster - size scaling , we obtain the phase diagrams including the effects of the quantum fluctuations . moreover , we summarize the reasons why the dipole - dipole interaction stabilizes the css states , based on the results obtained in secs .",
    "[ 3]-[5 ] .",
    "the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "we consider interacting hardcore bosons on a square lattice given by the following hamiltonian : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the creation and number operators of the hardcore bosons at site @xmath12 , @xmath13 denotes the hopping amplitude between nn pairs , and @xmath14 the chemical potential .",
    "the hardcore boson limit means the situation where two or more bosons are not allowed to occupy the same site due to the strong on - site interaction @xmath15 .",
    "we assume the existence of a long - range interaction @xmath16 between the hardcore bosons and consider two different forms of @xmath17 such that we study the effect of long - range interactions on the stability of supersolid phases through the comparison of the two models .",

    "the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent the strength of the nn and nnn interactions , respectively .",
    "the nn interaction @xmath4 tends to induce the checkerboard density - wave order depicted in fig .",
    "[ sublattice](i ) , while the strong nnn interaction @xmath5 favors the stripe pattern in fig .",
    "[ sublattice](ii ) .",
    "@xcite     schematic pictures of the sublattice structure of the ( i ) checkerboard and ( ii ) stripe patterns .",
    "the circles indicate the sites of the square lattice and the lattice sites of the same color belong to the same sublattice . ]",
    "thus , the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "@xcite we will focus on the regime of checkerboard ordering , @xmath25 ,  @xcite .",
    "the second one is the isotropic dipole - dipole interaction that is more realistic from an experimental point of view . in experiments of ultracold gases ,",
    "one of the most promising way to prepare long - range interacting systems is the use of the so - cold `` dipolar '' atoms , such as chromium ,  @xcite dysprosium ,  @xcite and erbium ,  @xcite or molecules , such as krb  @xcite and lics .",
    "@xcite these atoms and molecules have a large ( magnetic or electric ) dipole moment , which leads to strong long - range forces among the dipolar particles .",
    "we assume that the dipole moments are fully polarized along the direction perpendicular to the lattice plane . in this case",
    ", the interaction between the dipoles works isotropically and its long - range part can be well approximated by @xmath26.\\label{dip}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we refer to the model given by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ dip ] ) as the `` @xmath27 model , '' hereafter .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction falls off as the inverse cube of the distance as @xmath28 ( for the nn , nnn , third , fourth neighbors ) .",
    "therefore , it appears that most of the essential physics can be captured with just the first two terms , namely within the @xmath4-@xmath5 model .",
    "in fact , as will be shown in the next section , the mf phase diagrams of the two models are very similar ; there are regions of the standard sf phase , solid phases , and supersolid phases , including the css phase",
    ".    however , previous numerical analyses based on the qmc method demonstrated that the correct ground - state phase diagrams , which include quantum fluctuations , have a crucial difference between the finite - range @xmath4-@xmath5 model and the infinite - range @xmath27 model .",
    "for the @xmath4-@xmath5 model , the authors of ref .   concluded that the css phase predicted by the mf theory is completely destabilized by strong quantum fluctuations and does not appear in the qmc calculations for any value of @xmath29 , although they checked it only for @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast , as for the @xmath27 model , the main features of the mf phase diagram can survive ,  @xcite including the existence of the css phase .",
    "this indicates that the long - range part of the dipole - dipole interactions plays a crucial role in stabilizing the css phase . in the following sections",
    ", we shall analyze the ground states of the two models and discuss the role of the long - range interactions in the emergence of the css state in order to clarify the reasons why the two models have the qualitative difference .",
    "the instability of supersolid phases against phase separation has often been discussed from a perturbative point of view assuming that @xmath31 is small ; the total energy gains from the lowest - order hopping process of doped bosons ( or holes ) and from the surface energy are compared on classical solid states with / without a domain - wall .",
    "@xcite however , in the @xmath27 model , the css states can appear even for relatively large values of @xmath31 , and the structure called the @xmath32 @xmath33 with many different types of solid states emerges in the region of small values of @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite hence , we will present a more careful discussion from a different angle by using the lsw and cmf methods .",
    "to begin with , we show the ground - state properties within the mf theory . from the equivalence of the hardcore - boson and spin-1/2 operators ,  @xcite eq .",

    "\\hat{s}_j^\\lambda\\delta_{jl}.\\label{rule}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the pseudospin language , the occupied and unoccupied states of bosons correspond to the spin - up and spin - down states , respectively .",
    "thus the filling factor , which is the average density per site , of hardcore bosons can be calculated through the relation @xmath39 . here , @xmath40 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the pseudospin raising and lowering operators @xmath41 play the role of the creation and annihilation of the hardcore bosons ; @xmath42 .",
    "the effective magnetic field acting on the pseudospins is given by @xmath43 with @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the coordination number of the square lattice .",
    "as can be obviously seen from the definition , the zero magnetic field corresponds to the particle - hole symmetric point ( @xmath46 ) of the hardcore - boson model .",
    "moreover , the density @xmath47 and the condensate wave function @xmath48 of bosons are expressed by the longitudinal components @xmath49 and the transverse components @xmath50 as @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "@xcite from these correspondences , we can use the calculation methods which have been developed in the field of quantum spins for studying hardcore - boson systems .    at zero temperature , replacing the local pseudospin operators in eq .",
    "( [ spinh ] ) with the classical vectors of length @xmath53 , @xmath54 we obtain the mf ( classical ) energy as a function of the orientation of the local pseudospins @xmath55 : @xmath56-hs\\sum_j\\cos \\theta_j , \\label{eq : enecl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 minimizing the mf energy with respect to @xmath55 , we derive the classical pseudospin configurations in the usual manner ,  @xcite and translate the results into the hardcore - boson language . without loss of generality , we can take @xmath58 , which means that the canted spins are assumed to lie in the @xmath59 plane . the procedure described here",
