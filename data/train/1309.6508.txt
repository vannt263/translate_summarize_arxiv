    "entanglement detection and quantification are of great relevance for quantum information and quantum communication science  @xcite",
    ". two problems of significant importance then arise .",
    "first , one is interested to find out whether a quantum state is separable or entangled .",
    "second , if the state is entangled , one needs to quantify the amount of entanglement .",
    "a large amount of work is devoted to the first problem , dealing with the separability criteria  @xcite .",
    "the answer to the second question requires proper entanglement measures  @xcite , which is rather complicated in general .",
    "a possibility to answer this problems is the use of the schmidt number ( sn )  @xcite .",
    "it generalizes the schmidt rank  @xcite to bipartite mixed states , based on a convex roof construction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sn is closely related to the quantum superposition principle .",
    "it gives the minimal number of superpositions needed to construct the state under study .",
    "in other words , it is directly connected to the number of global superpositions of two entangled subsystems .",
    "it has been shown that the sn fulfills the axioms of entanglement measures  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it does not increase under all separable operations , so that it is a universal entanglement measure  @xcite .",
    "note that the convex sets of states having a sn less than or equal to @xmath0 , @xmath1 , have a nested structure of the form @xmath2 .",
    "thus , to verify to which set a state belongs , one can apply the method of sn witnesses  @xcite . for practical applications ,",
    "however , this requires specifying the accessible observables .    in practice ,",
    "continuous variable ( cv ) entangled states are often composed of squeezed states .",
    "hence , the latter are a key resource for cv quantum information processing and communication  @xcite .",
    "they are also fundamental in quantum teleportation protocols  @xcite .",
    "measurements are usually based on balanced homodyne detection , which easily yields the covariance matrix ( cm ) .",
    "the squeezed states and the resulting cv entangled states are usually gaussian and hence they are completely characterized by their cm  @xcite .",
    "the separability problem of bipartite gaussian states was completely solved  @xcite . however , even for this class of states , an experimentally accessible entanglement quantification is still missing .",
    "in fact , cv entanglement measures for broad experimental applications are presently unknown  @xcite .    in the present contribution , we fully characterize the bipartite gaussian sn witness operators .",
    "we show that , up to second order moments , there exist two generating classes of sn witnesses so that any gaussian witness operator can be expressed as a convex combination of them .",
    "this relates sn witnessing to the measurable cm of the quantum state under study , which leads to a simple operational method of entanglement quantification . for gaussian state",
    "this method is complete .",
    "for non - gaussian states it still yields useful lower boundaries , which certify a definite amount of entanglement . rather than searching for the best witness for any quantum state",
    ", we aim at extracting maximal information from the cm , which is usually recorded in cv experiments .",
    "we apply our approach to the entanglement quantification of examples of gaussian and non - gaussian mixed quantum states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ gsnw ] we review the sn witnesses and their optimization .",
    "then , we introduce the general form of gaussian sn witnesses and solve the set of sn eigenvalue equations .",
    "the process of sn witnessing using the measurable cm is considered in sec .",
    "some examples are discussed in this section .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in the following , we briefly review the sn witnesses and their optimization problem ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , we will study the class of gaussian sn witnesses .",
    "this yields an efficient method to count global quantum superpositions .",
    "a sn-@xmath0 witness @xmath3 is a hermitian operator such that @xmath4 , with @xmath1 , that is for all states having a sn less than or equal to @xmath0 .",
    "it is also required that @xmath5 for at least one state with a sn greater than @xmath0 , @xmath6 .",
    "since any witness operator can be written as @xmath7 with @xmath8 being a positive semidefinite operator , one can optimize any sn witness operator by choosing @xmath9 to be the infimum of @xmath8 over all pure ( and consequently mixed ) quantum states .",
    "that is , if @xmath10 denotes the set of pure states having a sn less or equal to @xmath0 , we get @xmath11 hence , a quantum state @xmath12 has a sn greater than @xmath0 , if and only if there exists a positive semidefinite hermitian operator @xmath8 such that @xmath13 obviously , by this optimization , there exists no finer witness constructed from @xmath8 in the form of eq .  .",
    "in other words , the number of states @xmath14 which can be detected by @xmath3 is maximal .",
    "hereafter , we only speak of the _ test _ operator @xmath8 rather than witness operator @xmath3 , having in mind that they are related through eq .  .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the optimization leads to the set of sn eigenvalue equations for @xmath15 : @xmath16 in which each component of @xmath17 and @xmath18 belongs to the first and second hilbert space , respectively .",

    "is , in general , a sophisticated task .",
    "however , it is possible to solve them for two maximally correlated cases and to provide the most general sn  test based on the cm .",
    "we consider the general class of two - mode positive semidefinite hermitian operators given in the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 define the position and conjugate momentum operators , @xmath29 is an arbitrary vector , and @xmath30 is a real hermitian matrix : @xmath31 it is well - known that for any local linear unitary transformation @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , there exists a symplectic transformation @xmath34 with @xmath35 , so that @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the cm of any state @xmath12 can be written in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 form diagonal submatrices  @xcite . here , @xmath42 is the standard form of the density operator as used to form the standard form of the cm .",
    "it is obtained from @xmath12 under some appropriate local , unitary transformations . in this form @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "this leads to the following result : for any gaussian test operator of the form   one can write @xmath46 with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .    for the proof ,",
    "let us fix the representation of the state to the standard form @xmath42 .",
    "obviously , the transformation from original to the standard form of the density operator , @xmath50 , does not affect the separable or entangled structure of the state and thus the sn , because we only dealt with local operations .",
    "consider the expectation value @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is given in eq .  .",
    "the last term in @xmath52 , regardless of the state , gives a constant @xmath53 .",
    "then , without loss of generality , it can be set to be zero .",
    "the linear term , as well as those corresponding to off - diagonal elements of @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , will vanish by using a local displacement operation and the standard form of the cm .",
    "therefore , we can choose these elements to be zero .",
    "now , the diagonal real matrices are reduced to @xmath56 for @xmath57 , the latter can be transformed into @xmath58 with two appropriate local squeezing operations which is equivalent to apply the following ( local ) symplectic transformation to @xmath52 : @xmath59 note that , hereafter , local orthogonal matrices @xmath60 and @xmath61 acting on the first and second modes , respectively , do not affect @xmath62 and @xmath63 . at this point , the coupling matrix @xmath64 takes the form @xmath65 after dropping the primes for shortening and to keep the consistency of the notation , the expectation value of the corresponding test operator takes the form @xmath66 in general , the operator @xmath8 in eq .",
    "can be written as the convex combinations of the form @xmath67 of two maximally correlated operators , @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "semiboundedness of @xmath72 then implies that @xmath73 and @xmath74 . in appendix  [ aii ]",
    "we have solved the sn eigenvalue problem for the operators in eqs .   and  , which are semibounded from below .",
    "accordingly , two particular boundary sn eigenvalues for @xmath75 are obtained as @xmath76 in the same way , for @xmath77 we have @xmath78 now , given any sn @xmath0 , @xmath79 is the lowest expectation value , @xmath80 , which a state @xmath81 can attain .",
    "thus , if for the state under study the expectation value drops below @xmath79 , then its sn exceeds the value @xmath0 .",
    "note that this method not only identifies entanglement , but also yields an entanglement measure in the form of a lower bound on the sn of the state .",
    "the particular boundaries @xmath82 are explicitly given in appendix  [ aii ] in forms of minors .",
    "it is noteworthy that the action of the partial transposition map @xmath83 , with @xmath84 ( @xmath33 ) , is equivalent to a mirror reflection of the @xmath85th subsystem in the phase space , or just the local time reversal of the @xmath85th subsystem  @xcite .",
    "applying @xmath86 ( @xmath33 ) to @xmath72 brings about a sign change of the determinant of @xmath87 . the other way around , under partial transposition ( pt ) transformation @xmath88 converts into @xmath89 and vice versa .",
    "in the following section , after the general argument of how to apply the witnesses based in eqs .",
    "and   to experimentally measured data , we examine examples of mixed gaussian and non - gaussian states . to quantify the entanglement of a bipartite quantum state within an experiment , we follow these steps :    a.   measure the cm of the state using standard methods , e.g. , homodyning .",
    "this is simply to measure the auto- or cross - correlations of the moments or quadratures up to second order .",
    "b.   transform the cm into its standard form , defined in eq .  .",
    "c.   choose the appropriate test operator between @xmath75 and @xmath77 : if @xmath90 , @xmath75 and if @xmath91 , @xmath77 should be choosen .",
    "if @xmath92 and @xmath93 one should examine both of the test operators @xmath75 and @xmath77 .",
    "d.   [ stepiv ] construct the expectation value of the test operator @xmath94 e.   optimize the parameters of the test operator , namely @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "let us point out that , if @xmath99 the method is not useful to be applied .",
    "this is because @xmath100 is a _ bona fide _",
    "cm if and only if @xmath101 ( @xmath57 )  @xcite . therefore , vanishing cross correlations give rise to an expectation value of the test operators @xmath102 , cf . step  .",
    "hence , no sn@xmath103 can be identified when there is no cross correlations in the cm .",
    "in fact , we always choose the test operator which gives the largest contribution from cross correlations .",
    "so far , we have seen that a second optimization of the test operators @xmath104 is needed .",
    "that is , for detecting the sn with the best precision , one should choose the optimized values for the parameters @xmath105 .",
    "this can be done by defining the distance from the lowest bound of the operator @xmath72 as @xmath106 in which @xmath107 .",
    "the optimal values for the parameters @xmath108 are obtained at the minimum point of this function .",
    "accordingly , this point is given by the solution of the equation @xmath109 .",
    "we assume @xmath110 as the free parameter for the optimization and we simply obtain @xmath111,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , this is not the only condition .",
    "one should also note that semiboundedness of @xmath72 requires that @xmath112 some states may fail to satisfy both these conditions .",
    "in such cases , we find the best choices by solving the equation @xmath113 to get @xmath114      to examine our sn test operators , consider a two - mode squeezed thermal state @xmath115 in which @xmath116 is the two mode squeezing operator and @xmath117 for @xmath57 is the thermal state of each mode with the mean thermal photon number @xmath118 . this state is a mixed gaussian state .",
    "adding locally an equal amount of thermal noise @xmath119 to each mode , we will get the following cm elements  @xcite : @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "this gives @xmath122 which can not detect entanglement . on the other hand",
    ", one has @xmath123 now , a simple minimization of the function @xmath124 of eq .",

    "it is easy to check that , for this state , the region of the thermal noise in which both of eqs .   and",
