    "high - throughput ( ht ) computational materials science is a rapidly expanding area of materials research . it merges a plethora of techniques from a variety of disciplines .",
    "these include the kinetics and thermodynamics of materials , solid - state physics , artificial intelligence , computer science , and statistics @xcite .",
    "the application of ht has recently led to new insights and novel compounds in different fields @xcite . despite the importance of thermal transport properties for many crucial technologies ,",
    "there are to date no high - throughput investigations into lattice thermal conductivity .    here",
    "we seek to address this challenge .",
    "we concentrate on the lattice thermal conductivity of half - heusler compounds , as they have great promise for applications as thermoelectric materials @xcite .",
    "half - heusler compounds are ternary solids .",
    "their crystalline structure consists of two atoms ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , located in equivalent positions in a rock - salt structure .",
    "a third atom ( @xmath7 ) sits in an inequivalent position , filling half of the octahedrally coordinated sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "experimental studies have reported the thermoelectric figure of merit for a small set of these systems and their alloys @xcite .",
    "theoretical electronic characterizations have been performed for 36 candidates @xcite .",
    "it has been speculated that their high thermal conductivity , close to @xmath8 , could limit thermoelectric performance @xcite . at room temperature ,",
    "the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath0 represents the largest contribution to the total conductivity .",
    "promising thermoelectric figures of merit have been reported both for @xmath9-type ( @xmath10 at @xmath11 @xcite ) and for @xmath12-type ( @xmath13 at @xmath14 @xcite ) half - heuslers .",
    "such values are comparable to the best thermoelectric materials proposed thus far @xcite . those values , however , were not found in ordered half - heuslers ; but rather in alloyed or nanostructured systems .",
    "furthermore , finding ordered compounds with very low @xmath0 is advantageous , as their electronic mobilities are expected to be higher than in alloys .",
    "in addition , alloying the already low-@xmath0 ordered compounds would lower @xmath0 even further .",
    "the pool of candidate compounds analyzed in this article is larger than in previous investigations .",
    "all possible half - heusler compounds from all combinations of non - radioactive elements in the periodic table are considered , as included in the aflowlib.org consortium repository @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "the formation enthalpies of the fully relaxed structures are obtained through density functional theory within the aflow high - throughput framework @xcite .    from a total of @xmath15 entries , those with positive formation enthalpies",
    "are removed .",
    "when several half - heuslers are related by permutations of elements , only the lowest - enthalpy configurations are considered .",
    "finally , zero - gap compounds are removed from the list . for the surviving subset of @xmath16 compounds ,",
    "the second - order force constants are characterized with full phonon dispersion curves .",
    "this allows further reduction of the set to a total of @xmath2 mechanically stable semiconductors .",
    "although these requirements do not guarantee global thermodynamical stability , metastable compounds with long lifetimes have been synthesized and used @xcite .",
    "hence , their inclusion should not be disregarded _ a priori_.    for the @xmath2 resulting stable half - heuslers , we compute a large set of structural , electronic and harmonic properties . in principle , one could directly compute @xmath0 for all the compounds . the computational requirements for",
    "this approach would be prohibitive . to solve this issue ,",
    "our strategy is to obtain @xmath0 for a smaller subset of systems .",
    "we use physical insights and machine learning techniques to predict the remaining values .",
    "cross - validation shows that the approach is reliable for rapidly identifying low-@xmath0 compounds .",
    "once the main factors correlated with a low thermal conductivity are identified for the @xmath2-hh library , we use the thermodynamical information in the aflowlib.org database to test the stability of these hhs against more than @xmath17 phases .",
    "all competing ternary compounds from the inorganic crystal structure database ( icsd ) @xcite and all binaries in that database sharing two elements with each hh are included .",
    "the final list of thermodynamically stable compounds contains @xmath3 entries .",
    "for these we devise and implement a novel approach to compute the lattice thermal conductivity . our accuracy is better than @xmath18 of the exact calculation , and has a much lower computational cost .",
    "this allows to provide estimates of @xmath0 that can be compared with experiment for @xmath3 thermodynamically stable compounds .",
    "the general expression for @xmath0 at temperature @xmath19 is @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the phonon branch index @xmath22 and wave vector @xmath23 , @xmath24 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath25 the bose - einstein distribution , @xmath26 the frequency of phonons , @xmath27 the phonon group velocity in the transport direction @xmath28 , and @xmath29 the relaxation time . the relaxation time is determined by third - order derivatives of the total energy with respect to the atomic displacements of any three atoms @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 in directions @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 , the anharmonic force constants ) in a large supercell @xcite .    in ordered half - heuslers",
    "the dominant source of scattering is due to three - phonon processes , and we can calculate thermal conductivities with the full _ ab - initio _ anharmonic characterization @xcite . for cosbzr , one of the most thoroughly studied half - heuslers , we obtain @xmath37 .",
    "the value is very close to a previous theoretical estimate ( @xmath38 ) for monocrystalline cosbzr @xcite , and slightly higher than the experimental values @xcite ( between @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "synthesized samples of refs .",
    "@xcite may contain microstructures and imperfections not considered in our work . despite of accuracy , `` full _ ab - initio _ calculations '' of @xmath0 ( eq . [ eqkappa ] ) are prohibitive for ht studies , due to the computational requirements of the derivatives giving @xmath29 .        in this section ,",
    "we present two different approaches circumventing the limitation .",
    "the first method is based on the empirical observation that the force constants show high degree of transferability between compounds sharing crystal structure @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a single set of anharmonic force constants could be used to get an estimate of the bulk @xmath0 .",
    "we call this thermal conductivity calculated with `` transferred '' forces @xmath41 ( see table  [ table_notation ] ) .",
    "we desired to preserve the choice between equivalent positions for maximizing transferability .",
    "thus , instead of taking the anharmonic force constants of a particular half - heusler compound , we choose those of mg@xmath42si .",
    "this compound shares the half - heusler lattice with sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 occupied by mg atoms . for cross - validation",
    ", we also fully compute the anharmonic force constants of @xmath43 half - heusler systems .",
    "these are randomly selected with uniform probability inside the convex hull of fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , to ensure a wide variety of harmonic / anharmonic features .",
    "comparison between @xmath0 and @xmath41 indicates that- although the latter has limited quantitative precision- the qualitative agreement is very good ; with a spearman rank correlation coefficient of @xmath44 . hence , the descriptor can be effectively used to separate compounds having high or low @xmath0 . note that we chose the spearman rank correlation @xcite instead of the usual pearson s .",
    "the former is invariant under any monotonic transformation of one or both variables , and takes values @xmath45 for any strict monotonic ( not just linear ) dependence .     at @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    "colored according to our low / high-@xmath0 classification based on @xmath48 ( see text ) ; the convex hull of the point set is also included for guidance . * ( b ) * frequency densities of the estimators of thermal conductivity at @xmath46 @xmath41 and @xmath48 as defined in the text . *",
    "( c ) * `` violin plot '' showing the distribution of @xmath49 within the low- and high-@xmath0 classes . ]            the second proposed approach is based on a completely different direction : we use `` random - forest regression '' by leveraging the @xmath43 fully calculated @xmath0 as a training set .",
    "we can then employ the fitted model to predict the remaining conductivities .",
    "we call these predictions @xmath48 ( see table [ table_notation ] )",
    ". random forests @xcite are a general classification and regression algorithms and the are well adapted to dependent input data .",
    "they have already been successfully applied to numerous problems @xcite , including compound classification @xcite . here , the @xmath43 compounds represent only around @xmath50 of the mechanically stable half - heuslers .",
    "our input data comprises a large set of descriptor variables , which is expected to correlate with @xmath0 ( supplementary materials ) but is less expensive to obtain .",
    "descriptors include :    * _ a priori _ chemical information : atomic number and weight , position in the periodic table , atomic radius , pauling electronegativity @xcite , and pettifor s chemical scale @xmath51 ( ref . ) .",
    "* general compound information : lattice constant @xmath49 , band gap , formation enthalpy , effective masses of electrons and holes , born effective charges and dielectric tensor . * specific thermal conductivity information : specific heat @xmath52 , spherically - averaged speed of sound @xmath53 , scaled nanograined - limit thermal conductivity @xmath54 and phase - space volume available for three - phonon scattering processes @xmath47 .    after an exploratory phase , we conclude that a satisfactory fit can be safely achieved using only _ a priori _ data .",
    "the random - forest method is performed in three steps .",
    "first , a large ensemble of decision trees is built by randomly selecting subsets of descriptors and observations .",
    "second , the predictions of all trees are obtained for each data point .",
    "third , the mode ( for classification ) or the mean ( for regression ) are taken as the result from the whole ensemble .",
    "the algorithm also provides an intrinsic metric to evaluate the importance of each descriptor .",
    "this is defined in relation to the effect of randomly permuting the values of that variable on the result @xcite ( the less resilient upon permutation , the more important ) .",
    "the prediction of each tree in a random forest can only be a value from the training set , and thus the result of the regression is a weighted average .",
    "this average is bounded by the minimum and maximum values within the training data .",
    "a small set is unlikely to contain elements having extreme values .",
    "hence , our random - forest regression is expected to have a marked centralizing effect , yielding values tightly grouped around their mean .",
    "the frequency densities of both @xmath41 and this new @xmath48 are displayed in fig .",
    "the latter avoids extreme predictions with non - physical magnitudes , a result of the aforementioned centralizing effect .    in this sense ,",
    "machine - learning algorithms outperform crude extrapolations such as those behind @xmath41 .",
    "additionally , @xmath48 has the advantage that its predictions can be refined with controlled accuracy by changing the size of the training set .",
    "even so , the spearman rank correlation coefficient between @xmath41 and @xmath48 is still @xmath55 , corroborating the validity of the analysis based on @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , we find that @xmath48 is strongly correlated with physical descriptors like @xmath52 , @xmath54 , and @xmath47 .",
    "this confirms our earlier speculation about these methods .",
    "an important concern when training a machine - learning model is whether the training set is diverse or representative enough to justify extrapolating the model to the remaining elements .",
    "the values of @xmath0 needed for direct validation of the predicted @xmath48 are unavailable .",
    "thus , we resort to a repeated @xmath56-fold cross - validation among the data points in the training set to obtain an estimate of the out - of - sample error . more specifically ,",
    "we evenly split our training set into @xmath56 subsets .",
    "then , we obtain a random - forest prediction for the hhs in each of the subsets by using only the remaining @xmath57 of compounds as the new training set .",
    "we repeat the process @xmath58 times for different divisions of the data , and compute the standard deviation of these predictions .",
    "the results are included in table .",
    "[ table1 ] .",
    "these estimates support the notion that the model behind @xmath48 is reasonably insensitive to our choice of training sets . for each cross - validation , we compute the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the out - of - sample random - forest results for the @xmath43 training compounds and their @xmath0 .",
    "the median value of these spearman rank correlation coefficients is @xmath59 , corroborating @xmath48 as a reliable tool for predicting compounds ordering .",
    "the ordering predicted by descriptor @xmath48 is strongly correlated with that of @xmath0 .",
    "this allows to pinpoint the main factors determining high or low thermal conductivities .",
    "the bimodal shape of the distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b suggests that two groups of half - heuslers can be identified , with thermal conductivities spread around two different values .",
    "a robust version of the `` @xmath32-means '' algorithm @xcite is employed to optimally place the medians of the low- and high - thermal - conductivity classes at @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively . by analyzing the importance of variables in the classification ,",
    "we identify a low pettifor scale @xmath62 and a large average pauling electronegativity @xmath63 as the most critical descriptors for low conductivity ( supplementary materials ) .    given the underlying correlations , many different choices can be used for the classification . a trend can even be suggested on the grounds of atomic radii by following a chain of correlations : if the two elements in equivalent positions are chosen so that their average radius is larger than @xmath64 , then the probability of the compound being in the low-@xmath0 class is @xmath65 .",
    "physically , this follows from the fact that @xmath0 is highly correlated with the specific heat @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "the latter is strongly negatively correlated with the lattice parameter @xmath49 : the larger @xmath49 the lower @xmath52 .",
    "dependence should be expected .",
    "in fact , the observed trend is sharper , due to the differences in debye temperature among the compounds . ]    in addition , @xmath49 correlates well with the sum of the atomic radii of the three elements , quantities known _ a priori_. the atomic radii of the species in positions @xmath7 concentrate around the average value .",
    "this leads to an accurate prediction of @xmath49 by using only the average atomic radius of atoms in positions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath66 .",
    "a large @xmath66 causes a large lattice constant , small specific heat , and finally , low thermal conductivity .",
    "alternatively , the lattice parameter can be used as a good discriminant : panel ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a `` violin plot '' illustrating the distribution of @xmath49 in the classes of half - heuslers with low and high thermal conductivities . also , as it can be seen in fig .  [ fig2]a our choice of easily computable descriptors such as @xmath52 and @xmath47",
    "is supported by the result of this classification .",
    "our calculations are for the true bulk lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "they are unrelated to the minimum value proposed by other authors @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some of the @xmath0 obtained directly seem ultra - low .",
    "they are even lower than @xmath67 , as reported in literature for agsbte@xmath42 and agbise@xmath42 @xcite , and described as close to the achievable minimum . however , the minimum depends on the compound s structure . even within the most stringent hypothesis of the shortest possible",
    "mean free path equal to interatomic spacing , the lowest found @xmath0 is much higher than the theoretical minimum . therefore , none of our predicted values violates the minimum lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "note also that , once the goal of reducing the @xmath0 under @xmath68 is achieved , its precise value loses relevancy as it is overtaken by the contribution of charge carriers , @xmath69 .",
    "the ingredients of @xmath0 for bulk ordered semiconductors depend only on a semilocal characterization of the potential energy surface around the equilibrium configuration . hence , mechanical stability is sufficient to permit the calculation of the lattice thermal conductivity of a hh . for the analysis performed in the previous section , having the set of @xmath2 mechanically stable",
    "hhs reduced and biased by external considerations such as thermodynamical stability would be detrimental to the performance of machine - learning techniques .    on the other hand , in order to propose particular candidates for experimentation we must maximize the probability that they can be obtained in the laboratory . to this end , we obtain the ternary phase diagrams for each of the @xmath2 mechanically stable hhs .",
    "this involves taking into account the formation enthalpies of a large number of possible competing phases .",
    "these include but are not limited to all relevant binary and ternary compounds in the icsd @xcite .",
    "more specifically , all the elemental compounds , @xmath70 binary structures and @xmath71 ternary phases were considered .",
    "many of these phases were already present in aflowlib.org ; others were computed specifically for this work .",
    "the total number of dft calculations necessary to obtain the results presented here exceeds @xmath72 .",
    "our thermodynamic analysis reveals that @xmath73 of the @xmath2 hhs are thermodynamically stable .",
    "spin - polarized calculations reveal that two of the @xmath73 have semimetallic ground states .",
    "then , only the remaining @xmath3 compounds are further considered .",
    "the ternary phase diagrams of the final @xmath3 systems are included in the supplementary materials .",
    "@xmath74 of the @xmath3 predicted stable compounds satisfy the octet or expanded octet rules by virtue of having @xmath75 or @xmath76 valence electrons per unit cell , respectively .",
    "we compared these numbers with the frequency distribution of valence electron counts in the initial @xmath15-hh library .",
    "we conclude that the conditional probabilities of compounds having @xmath75 or @xmath76 valence electrons per unit cell being stable are @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "while still small , the conditional likelihood of a compound satisfying one of these rules making it through all the filtering steps is much higher than the @xmath79 _ a priori _ probability .",

    "neither of the two descriptors of @xmath0 presented so far contains any information about the anharmonic interatomic force constants ( ifcs ) of each compound . on one hand ,",

    "this aids in achieving quantitative accuracy with a much lower computational cost than the full calculation .",
    "crystallographic symmetries and the equality of mixed partials impose linear constraints on the anharmonic ifcs . with the parameters described in the `` methods '' section below and those constraints , we are left with @xmath82 independent anharmonic ifcs per compound . however , many elements of this set are correlated among them , and others are too small to have a decisive role in the value of @xmath0 . to quantify these assertions ,",
