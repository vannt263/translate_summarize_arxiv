    "the evolution of planetary nebulae remains a challenging topic in astrophysics .",
    "several studies have focused on the link between the post - asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and planetary nebula phases to investigate the changes that occur in the evolutionary stage between these object classes .",
    "planetary nebulae ( pn ) have been observed over a wide wavelength range , from x - ray to radio frequencies .",
    "their complex morphologies and the shaping mechanisms that produced them are still a matter of debate .",
    "companion stars , jets from central stars , magnetic fields , dust tori , and interacting winds are some of the possible shaping agents suggested as being responsible for various pn morphologies , and an overlap of their actions can not be ruled out .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging has demonstrated that pre - pn show non  spherical symmetry even at late spectral types , which implies that the shaping process in these sources starts very early after the agb . non - spherically symmetric structures have also been observed in agb stars that are part of a binary system @xcite , which could indicate that some shaping agents are already active in this evolutionary phase . in general , the current theory of pn evolution is based on the interacting stellar wind ( isw ) model @xcite and its generalised version @xcite .",
    "however , this model does not account for shaping because it assumes that an asymmetric distribution of matter is already present when the wind interaction occurs .",
    "other models take into account the possible role of jets , and have been successfully applied to some nebulae @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the interaction with a companion object , even a massive planet , may provide the necessary asymmetry @xcite . also , large scale magnetic fields , influencing or determining the shapes , might be sustained by a dynamo process @xcite .",
    "the birth of a pn is defined by the observation of an ionisation front , which is itself a shaping agent and could heavily influence the morphology established in earlier evolutionary phases , disrupting the molecular and dust circumstellar shells .",
    "near- and mid - ir images of pn , which trace the molecular and warm dust emission , have been compared to optical line images , which trace the ionised elements , and have shown the presence of similar structures @xcite .",
    "therefore it seems that molecular and ionised gas and dust grains can spatially coexist in these sources .",
    "this makes the investigation of the spatial distribution and physical properties of the ionised component in these envelopes even more compelling .    in this context",
    ", important information can be provided by observations of very young pn , or pre - pn , where the physical processes associated with pn formation are still occurring . to investigate the properties of these rare objects in transition from the post - agb to pn",
    ", we have selected a sample of pre - pn and searched for radio emission from ionised shells .",
    "the targets were selected from stars classified in the literature as hot post - agb candidates , showing strong far - ir excess and b spectral type features .",
    "we detected radio emission in 10 sources in the selected sample @xcite .",
    "the detection of radio continuum emission is proof of the presence of free electrons and therefore of an ionised shell .    for a better understanding of these sources",
    ", we have performed a multi - frequency follow - up to build up radio continuum spectra and collect information about the physical conditions in the nebulae .",
    "several nebular parameters can be determined by radio flux density measurements ( for example , electron density and ionised mass ) but most calculations rely on the assumption of an optically thin emission .",
    "although this is presumably the case for observations at frequencies higher than 5 ghz , only the construction of the whole centimetre continuum spectrum can enable us to distinguish between optically thick and thin regimes .",
    "vla a array observations have also given us insight in the morphologies of the envelopes .",
    "multi - frequency observations were carried out at the very large array , managed by nrao , in several runs , at 1.4 , 4.8 , 8.4 , 14.9 , and 22.4 ghz ( respectively 20 , 6 , 3.6 , 2 , and 1.3 cm ) , in d and c arrays , to inspect the spectral energy distribution in the radio range .",
    "table [ tab1 ] lists the observation details .",
    "the 8.4 ghz observations were performed in 2001 @xcite . during the 2003 runs ,",
    "strong interference led to the failure of almost all of the 1.4 ghz observations and part of the 14.9 ghz ones . to acquire information about the lower frequency range of the spectrum of four sources ( namely iras 18062 + 2410 , 19336 - 0400 , 19590 - 1249 , 20462 + 3114 )",
    ", observations were performed in 2005 at both 1.4 and 8.4 ghz ; the latter ones enabled us to check for any intrinsic variation in the emitted flux . although these latter runs were carried out in a different array configuration ( with a smaller synthesised beam ) , this can not cause missing flux , since all of our sources are point - like in both d and c arrays at any frequency .",
    "the largest angular scale ( las ) is much larger than the typical sizes of these objects ( @xmath0 ) even at the shortest wavelength , being 60@xmath1 at 22.4 ghz ( d and c arrays have the same las ) .",
    "the nominal beam sizes in d array are 44@xmath1 , 14@xmath1 , 8.4@xmath1 , 3.9@xmath1 , and 2.8@xmath1 , while in c array they are 12.5@xmath1 , 3.9@xmath1 , 2.3@xmath1 , 1.2@xmath1 , and 0.9@xmath1 , respectively at 1.4 , 4.8 , 8.4 , 14.9 , and 22.4 ghz .",

    "22.4 ghz observations were carried out pointing at the target for four 7-minute scans alternating with 1-minute scans on the phase calibrator .",
    "the data were reduced with the * * a**stronomical * * i**mage * * p**rocessing * * s**ystem ( aips ) , according to the recommended reduction process : the data set was fillmed into aips with average opacity correction and nominal sensitivities ( _ _ doweight__=1 ) , edited to flag interference or any other bad points and calibrated along with point weights ( _ _ docalib__=2 ) .",
    "maps were obtained using the task imagr with natural weights and cleaned down to the theoretical rms noise whenever possible , performing some hundreds of iterations of the clean algorithm . the flux density for each source in every map",
    "was estimated by fitting a gaussian to the unresolved source ( task jmfit ) , and the rms noise was calculated in an area much larger than the synthesised beam ( @xmath2100 beam ) , without evident sources in it ( task imean ) .",
    "for iras 17423 - 1755 and 06556 + 1623 , a second nearby ( within 40@xmath1 ) source was detected and large wavelength data can not be considered indicative of their flux densities because of confusion problems .",
    "tables  [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] summarize the observation runs and the flux density measurements obtained .",
    "the reported error has been calculated as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a 5% absolute calibration error .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath5  @xcite + @xmath6  @xcite + @xmath7  @xcite    we notice that in some cases the data points , especially at higher frequency , seem to show a steeper than expected slope in the optically thin range ( @xmath8 ) . besides our modelling , we estimated the empirical spectral indexes by a linear fitting ( in the _ log - log _ plane ) of the data points that correspond to the optically thin regime ( typically 4.822.4 ghz data ) .",
    "the results of the fitting are summarized in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "because at high frequency ( 14.9 and 22.4 ghz ) a lack of short baselines may cause a lower sensitivity to flux from extended structures ( therefore a lower total flux density ) , we checked whether tapering our data ( i.e. , assigning larger weights to short baselines ) could lead to larger flux densities , thus making the slopes in the spectra less steep .",
    "we did not find any significant difference in the results from tapered and non - tapered data .",
    "the empirical spectral indexes of three of the targets ( iras 06556 - 1623 , 17381 - 1616 , and 17460 - 3114 ) are close to the expected value of -0.1 , and out of the expected range for three others ( iras 18442 - 1144 , 19336 - 0400 , and 19590 - 1249 ) .",
    "although we can not rule out that the observed steeper slopes might be real and further observations should be carried out , if we consider that the reported errors are based on a statistics on 4 points only , the deviation from -0.1 is not statistically significant .",
    "therefore we conclude that , within the errors , the spectral indexes are compatible with their expected value .    figure  [ fig : continuumplots ] shows the data points obtained in our vla runs , the model spectra , and the linear fitting . we have not included iras  17423 - 1755 in our modelling , because only two data points are available .",
    "the flux density values obtained for this target would indicate an optically thick spectrum up to 22 ghz .",
    "another particular result is the spectrum of iras  20462 + 3416 , which is well matched by the model in the 115 ghz range , while the 22.4 ghz point is higher than the others . since the measured radio flux densities are all below 1  mjy , even a small contribution from cold dust may be not negligible and so explain the 22.4 ghz measurement .",
    "observations in the mm and sub - mm ranges would assess whether such a cold dust component is present or not .",
    "in our modelling we have used data from 2001 , 2003 , and 2005 , since the sources that were re - observed in 2005 ( see above ) did not show any flux density variation with respect to the 2001 8.4 ghz results within observational errors .",
    "the only exception is iras 18062 + 2410 , whose flux density varied by about + 44% , increasing from 1.46@xmath90.09 in 2001 to 2.1@xmath90.1  mjy in 2005 , while its secondary calibrator , 1753 + 288 , varied from 0.82@xmath90.03  jy in 2001 to 1.41@xmath90.04  jy in 2005 ( + 75% ) .",
    "unfortunately it was not possible to use the same primary calibrator in the two runs ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) , which introduces a different density scale for the two measurements , although the error should be within a few percent ( 3 - 5% ) .",
    "the flux density variation in the secondary calibrator might indicate issues with the flux density calibration . since other targets were also observed in the same run and no change",
    "was measured in their flux densities within the observational uncertainties , we conclude that the variation observed in 1753 + 288 is real , as possible for a secondary calibrator , but it does not account for the variation observed in the target object .",
    "when we combine all of our observations of this target , including our 2003 measurement ( a array data - set ) of 1.66@xmath90.09  mjy , we can conclude that the radio flux density of iras 18062 + 2410 has increased during the period we have monitored it ( see figure  [ fig:18062incr ] ) .",
    "a similar uncommon increase of the radio flux density was detected in crl 618 from 1975 to 1991 @xcite .",
    "if , as observed in crl 618 , we assume a linear increase , we can fit the three points in figure  [ fig:18062incr ] and extrapolate that the ionisation in iras 18062 + 2410 started around 1991 , confirming the rapid evolution previously observed in this object @xcite .        the spherical model used in modelling this object allowed us to match the 2003 data , using the 2005 1.4 ghz value as an upper limit .",
    "we determine that the shell in this target is optically thick beyond 5 ghz .",
    "similar behaviour has been observed in crl 618 also @xcite .",
    "further observations , in both the radio and at other wavelengths , will help us to determine whether these objects share other common features .",
    "figure  [ fig : radiomaps ] shows the structures observed in the resolved targets .",
    "all except iras 18062 + 2410 show bipolar radio morphology , with clearly resolved peaks .",
    "iras 17381 - 1616 shows a hint of bipolarity , although the angular resolution is not adequate to show its morphology .",
    "@xcite also observed a sample of young pn with high resolution in the radio and found that most of their targets had a bipolar structure .",
    "such radio morphologies , to be set in the standard isw scenario , require a strong density gradient in the nebula , with higher density regions perpendicular to the main axis of the nebula @xcite . following this interpretation ,",
    "the two bright peaks of emission are due to an opacity effect , with the optically thin radio flux tracing higher density regions .",
    "the other possibility is that we are actually observing the very early onset of outflows / jets piercing the circumstellar envelope , as evident in many hst images of pre - pn @xcite and also pointed out by high - resolution co observations of the molecular component of the envelope @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to interpret the morphology observed in iras  22023 + 5349 in the framework of the standard isw model , even invoking a strong density gradient in the nebula . for this object",
    ", a jet would be a more likely source of the observed morphology .",
    "we have presented radio continuum observations of a small sample of pre - pn .",
    "the observations were carried out to inspect both the morphology and the physical conditions of the ionised component in these nebulae .",
    "compact planetary nebulae are , in principle , only one possible explanation for radio - frequency continuum emission from evolved stars , the others being stellar photosphere , chromosphere , and circumstellar dust @xcite .",
    "our observations rule out the possibility of a stellar wind or dust origin for the emission , since the obtained spectra are not compatible with such hypotheses .",
    "the dust would exhibit an approximate black body spectrum ( @xmath10 in the radio range ) , and a stellar wind would have a 0.6 spectral index over a wide range of frequencies @xcite .",
    "we have modelled the observed spectra assuming that the emission arises in spherical shells around the central stars , with the density decreasing as @xmath11 .",
    "the values of electron densities and ionised masses found for our targets confirm their nature as young pn , since they fall within the ranges expected for such objects .",
    "the data seem to point to a somewhat steeper than expected slope beyond 5  ghz but , by spectral fitting , we calculated spectral indexes that match , to within errors , the theoretical value of -0.1 .",
    "iras  18062 + 2410 appears to be optically thick up to 8.4  ghz and also shows flux density variations on a time scale of a few years .",
    "such variations are rarely observed in the post - agb / young - pn transition phase and indicate that this star belongs to a group of objects having such properties as those observed in crl 618 .",
    "iras 17423 - 1755 also seems to be optically thick at high frequency , but the complete spectrum is needed to confirm this result .",
    "quite interestingly , iras 20462 + 3416 , whose overall centimetre spectrum is very flat , has a larger flux density at 22.4 ghz than at lower frequencies .",
    "we speculate that this may be due to a contribution from cold dust .",
    "the high - angular resolution observations that we have presented show that the ionisation in these targets has already involved the walls of the cavity around the central star and is not limited to the tenuous gas within the cavity .",
    "all of the targets have been at least partly resolved , except iras 18062 + 2410 .",
    "almost all of the envelopes show two peaks of emission in a somewhat extended nebulosity that can be explained as an opacity effect , possibly due to a circumstellar torus , or the onset of jets .",
    "unlike the other targets , the envelope in iras 22023 + 5249 shows more of an elongation along an axis than two bright peaks .",
    "such a morphology would be better explained by the action of jets rather than the presence of a torus .",
