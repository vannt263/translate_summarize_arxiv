    "<S> only in such a state may the evolution of the medium be described in terms of thermodynamical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow is one of the experimental observables than can help resolve this question . </S>",
    "<S> it originates in non - central collisions , where due to the incomplete overlap of the nuclei , the region of overlap is not azimuthally symmetric . if the medium happens to behave collectively , this initial asymmetry will give rise to pressure gradients that change with the azimuthal angle and will modify the angular distribution of the produced particles . </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow , or @xmath10 , measures the amplitude of the azimuthal anisotropy in the observed particle distributions , and a strong signal suggests that such pressure gradients occurred early in the evolution of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> two analysis methods are employed in phobos for the measurement of flow . </S>",
    "<S> the hit - based analysis method , described in @xcite , was first used for the analysis of 130  gev data , providing results on the centrality and pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath10 . for the analysis of 200  gev data , </S>",
    "<S> the same method was applied without changes . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath10 for minimum bias charged hadrons at both energies is shown in figure [ fig : v2eta_en ] . at the startup of rhic , </S>",
    "<S> the expectation was that the pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath10 , if any existed , should be weak . </S>",
    "<S> this result , showing a strong dependence , was very surprising at the time and still poses a challenge to theoretical models . in order to further investigate the topic of elliptic flow , a new method which uses tracks in the phobos spectrometer , </S>",

    "<S> the gray boxes around the 200  gev data points represent the systematic errors.,width=453 ]    the phobos detector is based on silicon pad technology . </S>",
    "<S> several detector systems are used for measurements based on hits ( single layer detectors ) , or based on tracks ( multiple - layer vertex detector and spectrometer ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two spectrometer arms are placed inside a dipole magnetic field of 2 t , to allow for momentum measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the single layer detectors provide a wide pseudorapidity coverage , with the octagonal multiplicity detector covering the range @xmath12 ( for collisions at the nominal interaction point ) , and two sets of three silicon ring detectors covering a more forward region : @xmath13 . in these detectors , </S>",
    "<S> the passage of particles is recorded by their energy deposition in the silicon ( a `` hit '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed description of the phobos detector system can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental trigger is provided by two sets of scintillator detectors , the paddle counters , located on each side of the interaction region , along the beam line . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , a vertex trigger was given by two sets of erenkov detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the vertex trigger was crucial in obtaining the data set used by the hit - based analysis , which requires events with collision vertices centered at @xmath14  cm , where @xmath15 is the beam axis .     </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow of charged hadrons , measured as a function of transverse momentum , for the most central 50% of the 200 gev au+au cross - section @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gray boxes show the systematic uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudorapidity range of this measurement is @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the line corresponds to a hydrodynamical model calculation @xcite.,width=453 ]    the new track - based method determines @xmath10 by correlating the azimuthal angles of tracks reconstructed in the spectrometer with the event plane measured using the multiplicity detector . unlike the hit - based analysis , the track - based method uses events with vertices near the nominal interaction region , in order to maximize the track acceptance in the spectrometer . within this vertex range (-8  @xmath1710  cm ) , the central region of the octagon detector is not azimuthally symmetric , due to 4 gaps designed to let particles in the spectrometer and vertex detectors acceptances to go through without traversing additional material . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to have full azimuthal acceptance for the event plane determination , only parts of the detector further away from the nominal interaction region , which have no gaps , were used . </S>",
    "<S> following the strategy outlined in @xcite , two subevents of equal multiplicity , and symmetric over pseudorapidity , are employed to determine both the event plane and its resolution . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of this analysis method can be found in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : v2pt ] shows the measured transverse momentum dependence of the elliptic flow amplitude in the range @xmath16 , for events in the top 50% centrality . </S>",
    "<S> a curve representing a hydrodynamical model prediction @xcite , for the same event class and phase space cuts , is also shown . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath10 is seen to grow almost linearly as a function of transverse momentum , up to @xmath18  gev / c , and then it appears to saturate at a value of about 0.14 . </S>",
    "<S> this shape of the @xmath19 curve has been observed previously , both for charged hadrons and identified particles ( see , for example : @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of non - flow effects to experimental measurements of @xmath10 has been discussed extensively @xcite . in this analysis </S>",
    "<S> , the expectation is that by determining the event plane using two well separated sub - events , which are also separated from the pseudorapidity region where @xmath10 is being measured , the contribution of such non - flow effects should be noticeably reduced , particularly those originating from short range two - particle correlations . by comparing the result of figure [ fig : v2pt ] with results from reference @xcite , obtained using reaction plane and 2 and 4-particle cumulant methods , it is seen that the phobos result shows best agreement with the star result obtained with the 4-particle cumulant method , implying that the phobos result is indeed less sensitive to non - flow effects .     </S>",
    "<S> centrality dependence of the elliptic flow , for @xmath20 , shown as a function of the number of participants @xmath21 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the closed circles represent the result of the track - based method , and the closed triangles show the result of the hit - based method , both for collisions at 200  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the open triangles show the previously obtained result from the hit - based method at 130  gev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gray boxes represent the systematic uncertainties for the track - based method . </S>",
    "<S> the line shows a hydrodynamical calculation at @xmath22  gev @xcite.,width=415 ]    the results for the centrality dependence of @xmath10 , obtained with both analysis methods , are compared in figure [ fig : v2npart ] . </S>",
    "<S> also included in the figure is the result for 130  gev , previously obtained with the hit - based method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a very good agreement between the two methods is seen . </S>",
    "<S> the curve shown in the figure corresponds to the same hydrodynamical model mentioned previously .     </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow of charged hadrons measured as a function of pseudorapidity @xcite , for three centrality classes : @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively from top to bottom ( top is peripheral , bottom is central ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hit - based method results are represented by triangles , and the track - based results are shown by circles , with open circles representing a reflection of the results about mid - rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the gray boxes indicate the systematic errors for the hit - based method results.,width=377 ]     pseudorapidity dependence of the charged hadron elliptic flow for 3 centrality regions ( @xmath23 squares , @xmath24 triangles , @xmath25 circles ) , for 200  gev au+au collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results for positive @xmath26 were obtained by reflecting the hit - based measurements about mid - rapidity , and then combining them with the track - based measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the systematic errors are shown as boxes for @xmath27 , and the statistical errors are shown for the reflected points ( open symbols ) at negative @xmath26.,width=453 ]    the shape of @xmath28 for three centrality classes ( `` peripheral '' : @xmath23 , `` mid - central '' : @xmath24 , `` central '' : @xmath25 ) is shown in figure [ fig : v2eta ] , with results from both analysis methods . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the two methods , within their range of overlap , is very good . </S>",
    "<S> the general features of the shape are common to the three centrality classes , and resemble that of the minimum bias result from figure  [ fig : v2eta_en ] .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : v2comb ] shows @xmath29 for the same three centrality regions , but with the hit - based and track - based methods results combined . </S>",
    "<S> given that these methods employ different detectors and techniques , they are taken as independent , and as such , it is assumed when combining the results that their errors are not correlated . </S>",
    "<S> the combination procedure is detailed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> at least for the semi - peripheral collisions , it is clearly seen that the decrease of @xmath10 with @xmath26 starts already near mid - rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the measured pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath10 appears to change only by a scale factor as centrality increases , but a flattening of the shape for the most central bin studied can not at present be ruled out .    </S>",
    "<S> another recent result obtained by phobos @xcite , with a hit - based method similar to the one mentioned above , used data sets at four different rhic beam energies to compare the pseudorapidity dependence of the elliptic flow within the context of limiting fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> the results , presented in figure [ fig : limfrag ] , are shown as a function of @xmath30 , which is the value of the pseudorapidity when shifted by the beam rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the elliptic flow at all four energies studied appears to be independent of energy in @xmath30 , displaying limiting fragmentation throughout the entire range of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this is another surprising feature of elliptic flow results at rhic , given that particle production in the limiting fragmentation region is thought generally to be distinct from that at midrapidity , but in this case there is no evidence for two separate regions in any of the four energies analyzed .     </S>",
    "<S> elliptic flow in au+au collisions for four beam energies , averaged over centrality ( 0 - 40% ) , and show as a function of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars represent the statistical errors only.,width=415 ]    in conclusion , the phobos collaboration has presented an ensemble of measurements of charged hadron elliptic flow , including a unique measurement of the pseudorapidity dependence of @xmath10 over a large range for several beam energies . both @xmath19 and @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> are well described by hydrodynamical models , within their range of applicability ( i.e. , mid - central to central collisions , and @xmath32 up to about 1  gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , no model to date has been able to reproduce the shape of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here for the centrality and energy dependence of this shape provide additional input that may give further insight into this issue . </S>"
