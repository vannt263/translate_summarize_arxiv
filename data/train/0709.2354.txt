    "direct detection of the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) in archival observations of nearby galaxies , particularly those from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) , has recently proved successful .",
    "luminous red supergiant progenitors of the hydrogen rich type ii - p sne have now been identified @xcite , with initial masses above 8m@xmath4 .",
    "however the progenitors of type ib / c sn , believed to be the cores of massive stars that have lost their outer envelopes , have so far eluded discovery ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the two nearest type ib / c sne with deep pre - explosion images ( sn2002ap in m74 at @xmath79mpc and sn2004gt in ngc4038 at @xmath714mpc ) had no progenitor detected @xcite .",
    "the progenitors were limited to either lower mass stars that were stripped of their hydrogen - rich envelope via binary interaction , or single stars with masses @xmath8 for which radiatively driven mass loss may have been sufficient to remove the outer layers . in the case of the type ib sn  2006jc the progenitor was discovered in an lbv - like outburst state 2 years before explosion , suggesting it was a very massive star @xcite .",
    "some fraction of type ib / c sne also produce gamma - ray bursts , hence any information on their progenitors would be critical for the field .    in this letter we study the explosion site of sn  2007gr in ngc 1058 and confirm it as a type ic .",
    "sn  2007gr was discovered by @xcite on 2007 aug 15.15ut , located at @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite spectroscopically classified sn 2007gr as type ib / c , but suggested that the presence of strong o i @xmath107774 and ca ii ir triplet absorptions were similar to those features observed in type ic sne .",
    "we adopt a total reddening towards sn  2007gr of @xmath11 ( valenti et al . in prep ) . where standard filter sets were employed extinctions were calculated using the laws of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) , and for hst observations using the @xmath12 relations of @xcite .",
    "the pre - explosion site of sn  2007gr was observed on 2001 jul 03 with the _ wide field and planetary camera 2 _ ( wfpc2 ) on board",
    "hst as part of programme go-9042 .",
    "observations were made in the f450w and f814w filters ( 460s each ) and photometry was carried out using the psf - fitting photometry package hstphot @xcite .",
    "further ground - based observations of ngc1058 were found in the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) and the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) archives .",
    "the wht ingrid @xmath13band images from 2001 oct 6 had a total exposure time of 1320s and an image resolution of 12 .",
    "the int wfc images from 2005 jan 13 were taken using @xmath14-band ( 180s ) and narrow h@xmath15 filters ( 600s ) with image quality of 09 .",
    "ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) observations of sn  2007gr were taken on 2007 aug 19 using altair / niri on the 8.1-m gemini ( north ) telescope .",
    "exposures totalling 930s were acquired in @xmath6-band using the sn as the natural guide star .",
    "the reduced image is of exceptionally high quality showing near diffraction limited resolution of 008 , with a pixel scale of 0022 providing excellent sampling of the psf .",
    "fig.[fig : pre_and_post ] shows that this gemini image even resolves some objects which appear blended in the hst data , an effect of the 01 pixel scale of the wfpc2 chip . in order to confirm the classification of the sn ,",
    "a spectrum was obtained on 2007 sept 11 using the wht equipped with isis ( r300b+r158r ) .",
    "the site of sn 2007gr fell on the wf2 chip of the pre - explosion wfpc2 observations . to determine the position of the sn site accurately on these images we calculated a transformation to map the coordinate system of the post - explosion gemini image to the wfpc2 pre - explosion frames using the iraf geomap task",
    ". positions of 19 stars common to both the wfpc2 f814w and gemini @xmath6-band images provided a general geometric transformation ( involving shifts , scales and rotation ) with an rms error of @xmath16mas .",
    "the sn position was measured in the gemini image and transformed to the coordinate system of the f814w pre - explosion frame yielding a pixel position on the wf2 chip of [ 250.65 , 118.34 ] .",
    "fig.[fig : pre_and_post]a & b show that the sn site is very close to , but not coincident with , an object that is bright in both the f450w and f814w images .",
    "its position was measured as [ 250.10 , 119.56 ] with an accuracy of @xmath17mas .",
    "the sn site is therefore 0121 west and 0056 south of this bright object .",
    "@xcite give a position for sn2007gr on the wfpc2 images that is around 66 mas further north than our position , meaning our respective positions are not coincident within the combined errors ( combined error from this study @xmath18mas , li et al .",
    "claim @xmath16mas ) .",
    "we suggest that the li et al .",
    "error has been underestimated given that they used a megacam image of the sn from the canada france hawaii telescope to perform differential astrometry , which is of much lower resolution than our gemini data .",
    "the position of the sn on the int and wht pre - explosion observations was determined using a similar method . the int r-band image ( fig.[fig : pre_and_post]d ) shows significant flux at the sn position , but",
    "this is almost certainly due entirely to the resolved sources observed in the hst frames .",
    "subtraction of the r- band continuum from the @xmath19 image identifies regions of strong @xmath19 emission .",
    "since hot ob - type stars are required to ionise the hydrogen gas , @xmath19 emission is generally associated with clusters of young , massive stars .",
    "the image subtraction package isis 2.2 ( alard & lupton 1998 ; alard 2000 ) was used to match the psf , flux and background of the int r image to its @xmath19 counterpart .",
    "fig.[fig : pre_and_post]e shows several regions of quite strong emission surrounding the sn site , but none exactly coincident with its position . in the wht k - band image ( fig.[fig : pre_and_post]f )",
    "nothing is visible at or near the sn position .",
    "sn2007gr occurred in a large , extended star - forming region that in fig.[fig : pre_and_post ] is at least 5  in diameter ( 250pc ) . within this",
    "there are bright sources , some of which are point - like and others which are clearly extended .",
    "most of these are likely to be compact stellar clusters rather than single individual supergiants .",
    "compact star clusters tend to be clustered together into large star forming complexes of the order 50 - 300pc , and the recent study of the cluster complexes in m51 shows many that are morphologically similar to the region hosting sn2007gr .",
    "hstphot photometry of the pre - explosion wfpc2 observations gave apparent magnitudes for the bright object close to the sn site of f450w @xmath20 and f814w @xmath21 .",
    "converting these to absolute standard magnitudes using the distance to ngc  1058 and extinction corrections ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) , and the colour corrections of @xcite , gave @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "if it is a single star it is a 30 - 40m@xmath4  post main sequence supergiant star , or a more massive but extinguished ( @xmath24 mag ) main sequence object .",
    "such bright , single stars are not without precedent in star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they are few in number in any typical spiral due to the short lifetimes of the blue - yellow supergiant phase ( e.g. eldridge & tout 2004 )",
    ".    surrounding the sn location are several other objects of similarly high luminosity that have colours consistent with o- to f - type supergiants ( fig.[fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "it is unlikely that one would observe such a large number of extremely massive stars during this very short evolutionary supergiant phase in such a small surface area of the disk .",
    "suggest that sources brighter than @xmath25 are most probably clusters .",
    "several of the objects appear extended implying that they are most probably not single stars .",
    "most however , including the bright source nearest the sn location , are not significantly broader than the stellar psf ( fwhm@xmath71.5 pixels ( 015 ) ) , which at a distance of 10.6mpc corresponds to 7.7pc . given its absolute magnitudes and its proximity to the sn site ( @xmath76.9pc ) one could suggest that this bright object is a coeval cluster of diameter less than @xmath77.7pc , which hosted sn  2007gr . if it could be confirmed as such a cluster",
    "this is potentially a powerful way of determining the initial mass of the sn progenitor .    in an attempt to constrain the true spatial extent of this object and others we used the _ ishape _ routine , part of the baolab package ( larsen 1999 , 2004 ) .",
    "larsen ( 2004 ) suggests that _ ishape _ can limit the intrinsic size of a significantly detected source ( s / n @xmath750@xmath26 ) down to @xmath710 per cent of the psf fwhm , which here corresponds to @xmath71pc .",
    "elliptical moffat profiles with a power law index of -1.5 were convolved with tinytim ( krist & hook 1997 ) wfpc2 psfs and fitted to all the objects within 3@xmath27 of the sn position .",
    "those sources which are detected at @xmath2810@xmath26  level and have fitted fwhm values @xmath280.15 pixels ( 10 per cent of the psf fwhm ) in one or both of the hst observations are identified as extended in fig.[fig : cmd ] . the bright source nearest the sn position is best fit with a delta function , suggesting that its diameter is no larger than @xmath71pc , and that it is more likely a star rather than a cluster .",
    "however , aperture photometry of the gemini ao image , calibrated using the two bright 2mass sources north and south of the sn , revealed that several sources around the sn location have significant k - band excesses when compared to main sequence and supergiant stellar colours ( see fig.[fig : cmd ] ) , implying that they are not individual massive stars .",
    "two of these sources are measured as point - like by _ ishape_. unfortunately we can not measure a k - band magnitude for the object nearest the progenitor site in the gemini image due to the brilliance of the sn .",
    "additionally the @xmath19 image ( fig.[fig : pre_and_post]e ) gives some idea of the location of the youngest ob - stars within this large star - forming region .",
    "sources in the hst images coincident with the @xmath19 flux are marked in fig.[fig : cmd ] .",
    "their association with significant @xmath19 emission implies that they are most likely young compact star clusters rather than single massive supergiants .",
    "we note , however , that no significant @xmath19 emission is observed exactly coincident with the object nearest the sn site .",
    "if this object is actually a massive single star rather than a cluster , and the progenitor is an unrelated star within this extended star - forming region , then we can attempt to derive a luminosity limit for the undetected sn progenitor .",
    "we added fake stars of various magnitudes into the wfpc2 images at the position of the sn progenitor and tried to recover both the real and fake sources simultaneously with psf - fitting techniques .",
    "we defined the detection limit in each filter as the magnitude of the fake source that must be added to the image in order for it to be independently detected at a position coincident with the progenitor site .",
    "the detection limits were thereby found to be f450w @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and f814w @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the detection limit for the wht k - band image was found to be @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) by adding fake stars of increasing luminosity at the sn position and determining , by eye , at what magnitude an obvious source became visible .",
    "fig.[fig : spectra ] shows our wht + isis spectrum compared with those of well studied type ib / c sne .",
    "the phase corresponds to about two weeks past maximum ( valenti et al . in prep . ) .",
    "while in sn  1999dn the he i lines are prominent , they are weak ( if at all visible ) in the type ic sne and also in sn  2007gr , suggesting that sn  2007gr is of type ic .",
    "sn  2007gr shows clear similarity to sn 1994i ( and , more marginally , to sn  2004aw ) .",
    "however , the presence of narrower features due to metals in the spectrum of sn 2007gr makes this object rather peculiar .",
    "if we assume that the bright object closest to the sn site is a single , massive star , one can attempt to place constraints on the properties of the sn progenitor using the detection limits derived in the previous section .",
    "however , these magnitude limits are much shallower than those found for the progenitors of sn  2002ap @xcite and sn  2004gt @xcite .",
    "since the sn was of type ic we can reasonably assume that its progenitor was a wolf - rayet ( w - r ) star ( e.g. eldridge & tout 2004 ) .",
    "comparing our magnitude limit of @xmath30 with b - band photometry of w - r stars shown in fig.8 of @xcite , we see that almost all of these observed w - r stars fall below our detection limit .    if , however , the bright object closest to the sn site is an unresolved stellar cluster , then it must have a diameter of less than @xmath77.7pc ( fwhm of the psf ) or perhaps less than @xmath71pc ( _ ishape _ analysis ) . in the case of the latter the progenitor",
    "would then be on the outskirts of the cluster , although still quite possibly coeval , e.g. ngc  3603 in the milky way .",
    "if sn  2007gr arose from one of the most evolved stars in such a coeval cluster then the cluster age would give an estimate of the age and initial mass of the progenitor .",
    "a similar argument has been used to estimate the progenitor mass of the type ii - p sn  2004dj @xcite , through @xmath35 population fitting of the @xmath36 spectral energy distribution .",
    "the @xmath35 code @xcite computes a coeval stellar population at a range of ages , with a user - defined initial mass function .",
    "a cluster of mass @xmath37m@xmath4  at an age of @xmath1myrs produces the absolute @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( assuming solar metallicity , an upper mass limit of 100m@xmath4 , a salpeter imf , and a coeval burst of star - formation ) .",
    "the geneva stellar models imply a turn - off mass of 25m@xmath4  for the cluster , while our stars stellar models ( eldridge & tout 2004 ) imply a similar mass of @xmath3m@xmath4 .",
    "these are compatible with the minimum stellar mass thought to produce w - r stars through single stellar evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however this age solution is not unique as @xmath35 can produce @xmath40 when the cluster has evolved to @xmath2myrs . at this age",
    "the turn - off mass would be between @xmath5m@xmath4 , much too low to produce a w - r star via single stellar evolution , and we would be forced to conclude that the progenitor was a lower mass w - r star resulting from an interacting binary .",
    "this degeneracy can only be broken with the extra wavelength coverage of the host cluster .",
    "in particular the @xmath41-band is an excellent discriminator of age , and would allow its determination to within a few myrs . at the older age",
    "the cluster becomes much redder in the nir bands , with an estimated @xmath42 and hence we would expect to detect the source at an apparent magnitude of @xmath43 .",
    "the detection limit of the wht k - band image lies just at this level , and this would favour the younger solution , suggesting the w - r progenitor formed from an initially 25 - 30m@xmath4  star .    in approximately two years time , the sn will have faded enough that the putative cluster can be studied in detail , in the uv , optical and nir with ground - based ao imaging and hopefully a fully refurbished hst . with these higher spatial resolution and multi - wavelength images of the immediate environment",
    "we will be able to determine if indeed it is a compact cluster and better ascertain its properties .",
    "given the difficulties in pinning down the progenitors of ib / c sne , even with very deep pre - explosion imaging @xcite , this particular case may offer us the best opportunity to estimate the initial mass of a type ic progenitor .",
    "the proximity and luminosity of sn  2007gr will make it one of the best studied , and modelled type ic sne to date , and it will be interesting to compare future ejecta mass estimates with our cluster turn - off mass .",
    "observations were from : the nasa / esa hubble space telescope obtained from the data archive at the space telescope science institute ; the gemini observatory ; the isaac newton group archive from casu astronomical data centre .",
