    "the two - way channel  @xcite models the scenario where two nodes exchange messages via a noisy channel . despite its simple setup , the capacity ( in the shannon sense ) of this channel",
    "is not known in general .",
    "one of the difficulties is to determine the optimal way to utilize feedback , i.e. , how ( and if ) the node should process and transmit its past received signals .",
    "it has been shown that not utilizing the feedback can be strictly suboptimal  @xcite . however , for the white additive gaussian noise ( awgn ) two - way channel , han  @xcite has shown that the capacity can be achieved without using feedback , i.e. , using independent gaussian codewords for the nodes .",
    "the result that feedback is not useful in the awgn two - way channel does not generalize to the case of more nodes . when there are more nodes , feedback can improve the achievable rates over non - feedback schemes via ( i ) coherent combining and ( ii ) relaying  @xcite .",
    "coherent combining is achieved by correlating the nodes inputs to achieve a higher signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) ; relaying is achieved by having a node to help in forwarding data when the quality of the direct link from the source to the destination is poor .    in a three - node network ,",
    "different variations of message flows can take place  @xcite .",
    "these include the multiple - access channel  @xcite , the relay channel  @xcite , and the broadcast channel  @xcite  the capacity of the last two channels remains unknown to date . in this paper , we consider the _ conferencing _ three - way channel ( subsequently referred to as the three - way channel ) , where each node broadcasts its message to the other two nodes .    for the awgn three - way channel , eswaran and gastpar  @xcite proposed a feedback scheme based on the modulated estimate correction ( mec ) technique  @xcite to exploit the coherent - combining gain .",
    "they showed that their proposed scheme achieves the sum - rate capacity under the following assumptions : ( i ) all nodes receives the same channel output ; ( ii ) the transmit signals are subject to per - symbol power constraints ; ( iii ) all nodes have the same transmitted power , receiver noise power , and channel gain .    in this paper , we consider two classes of three - way channels : the finite - field model and the phase - fading awgn model .",
    "we show that the non - cooperative coding scheme ( which does not use feedback ) is optimal for the finite - field three - way channel . while the same scheme is not necessarily optimal for the phase - fading awgn model in general ,",
    "we show that it is optimal when ( i ) all nodes transmit at the same rate ( _ equal rate _ ) and ( ii ) each node receives an equal snr from the other two nodes ( which we term _ sender symmetrical _ ) .",
    "we next propose a scheme that utilizes feedback .",
    "while the mec scheme exploits coherent combining , random phase shifts in the phase - fading channel prevent any coding scheme to harvest the gain from coherent combining . instead",
    ", we propose a scheme that utilizes feedback via relaying and network coding .",
    "the idea is for one node to help the other two nodes by relaying their messages for each other , and it does so using network coding . we show that this proposed scheme achieves the equal - rate capacity of the _ reciprocal _ ( meaning that each node pair has the same snr in the forward and backward links ) phase - fading awgn three - way channel .    the three - way channel with correlated sources has been studied by lai et al .",
