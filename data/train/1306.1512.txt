    "low frequency fluctuations of magnetic flux are a dominant noise source in a wide range of superconducting circuits , including squid - based magnetometers and rf - squid flux qubits used as the building blocks for quantum computing architectures.@xcite in the case of qubits , this magnetic flux noise places fundamental limits on the performance and scalability of such architectures . low frequency flux noise is widely thought to be due to fluctuations of magnetic impurities local to the superconductor wiring@xcite but the identity of these impurities and the physical mechanism producing the observed fluctuations is not known . understanding the fundamental origin of flux noise is important not only to aid in its reduction in superconducting devices , but",
    "also may provide insight into the behavior of disordered ensembles of spins at low temperature .",
    "indeed , flux noise experiments@xcite suggested the presence of a spin - glass phase , motivating further computational studies of fluctuations in spin - glasses.@xcite    some likely candidates for spin impurities include dangling - bonds in the oxide surrounding the superconducting wire,@xcite or disorder - induced localized states at the superconductor - insulator interface.@xcite the key point is that the spins must be located close to the superconducting wire for their flux to be significant .",
    "any mechanism that produces spin dynamics will contribute to flux noise .",
    "since spin - lattice relaxation is suppressed at low temperatures,@xcite it was proposed that the rkky interaction between spins is responsible for spin - diffusion and flux noise;@xcite however their theory of spin - diffusion predicted @xmath0 noise independent of temperature , thus it does not explain the frequency and temperature dependence of flux noise observed in squids.@xcite    anton _ et al._@xcite recently presented a comprehensive experiment that seemed to contradict the spin - diffusion interpretation ; they measured flux noise above @xmath2  mk and proposed a power law fit of the form @xmath3 , showing that the temperature dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath5 leads to the presence of a pivot frequency , below ( above ) which the noise decreases ( increases ) with increasing temperature .",
    "in this article , we propose a theory of spin - diffusion in squids that explains these observations .",
    "we predict the presence of a crossing band supported by ref .   and present additional experimental measurements of flux noise in superconducting flux qubits in a temperature range between 20 and 80 mk that confirm this prediction .",
    "the model allows us to use these measurements to estimate the spin - diffusion constant and explore its dependence on temperature .",
    "we assume an ensemble of spin-@xmath6 impurities distributed nearby the squid wire ; each spin is located at @xmath7 , and described by the dimensionless spin operator @xmath8 .",
    "the squid detects a total flux of @xmath9 with a flux vector @xmath10 representing the dependence of the flux on different spin orientations .",
    "we can find an explicit expression for @xmath11 by noting that the coupling energy between the spin and the squid is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the magnetic moment of the electron spin , @xmath14 is its @xmath15-factor , @xmath16 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath17 is the magnetic field produced by the squid s current density @xmath18 .",
    "the flux - inductance theorem ( proven in section 5.17 of ref .  ) implies that the flux produced by the spin must relate to the coupling energy according to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total current flowing through the squid s loop . from this",

    "the thermal equilibrium flux noise @xmath22 can be computed in the so called spin - diffusion regime , where only long wavelength fluctuations of the spin system are taken into account .",
    "this is done by considering a coarse - grained impurity spin field , @xmath23 , with the flux written as @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we consider a model hamiltonian of exchange coupled spins , @xmath27 in the paramagnetic phase ( where @xmath28 ) the spin field will satisfy the following langevin equation,@xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a diffusion constant ( possibly temperature dependent@xcite ) , and @xmath31 is a random force that drives the spins into thermal equilibrium with themselves .",
    "this implies the following correlation for the random force,@xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the area density for spins , @xmath34 is the interacting spin susceptibility ( defined as @xmath35 at @xmath36 ) , and @xmath37 is the free spin ( curie ) susceptibility .",
    "this random force correlator is chosen so that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is satisfied ( thus leading to the expected thermal equilibrium state at long times ) .",
    "we emphasize that we assume the spins are decoupled from their lattice , so that the total magnetization @xmath38 is conserved [ the presence of @xmath39 in eq .",
