    "the question of a possible existence of modes trapped in open two - dimensional systems has been a classic in the theory of waveguides ; trapped modes due to particular boundary conditions were studied already half a century ago @xcite .",
    "however , only much later it was realized that the introduction of bends and crossings into waveguides gives rise generally to confined states , or bound states which exist below the cutoff frequency for the waveguide @xcite .",
    "the existence of such states has both theoretical significance and implications for possible applications .",
    "they have been subsequently discussed in many papers , in addition to those mentioned above we refer to the monograph @xcite and the bibliography there .    in this paper",
    "we consider a system of two straight waveguides of the same width @xmath3 which cross at a nonzero angle @xmath0 .",
    "the right - angle case was of one of the first examples where the binding was studied .",
    "schult , ravenhall , and wyld @xcite showed the existence of two bound states .",
    "one of them is a true bound state at the energy @xmath4 in the natural units , while the other one at @xmath5 is embedded into the continuum and does not decay due to the symmetry .",
    "the latter corresponds to the single bound state in an l - shaped tube of width @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "our aim is to show how the spectrum of such a junction , which we will call for the sake of brevity `` scissors '' in the following , changes as the angle @xmath0 varies over the interval @xmath2 .",
    "we will show that as we go further from the cross symmetry if the right - angle structure , new bound states emerge from the continuum . in strongly skewed junction corresponding to a small @xmath0",
    "there are many of them .",
    "the mechanism responsible for their existence is the same as for the bound states in sharply broken tubes studied theoretically and experimentally in @xcite , namely a long part of the junction where there transverse contribution to the energy is substantially lower than @xmath7 . in the present case",
    ", however , the system has a mirror symmetry with respect to the axis of the complement angle @xmath8 and the bound states exist in pairs corresponding to different parity .",
    "we will show that as the angle @xmath0 diminishes and the states become strongly bound , the energy gap between the even and odd member of the pair vanishes exponentially fast .",
    "we also study the behavior around the critical values @xmath9 where the bound states emerge from the continuum .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that the binding energy of the weakly - coupled states behaves as correction @xmath10",
    "before analyzing the scissor spectrum , let us discuss how such a structure can be realized experimentally as a microwave device .",
    "it is no problem , of course , to build crossed waveguides in the ways explained in @xcite .",
    "however , in such a setting it is not easy to vary the geometry continuously .",
    "our point here that this goal can be achieved with a structure of a fixed angle if the latter is filled by a ferrite with an axial magnetic anisotropy and an external magnetic field is applied .",
    "we will show that this leads to an effective angle controlled by the field strength , following the idea which was first applied to the equivalence between a ferrite - filled squared resonator with an external magnetic field and a field - free rhombic polygon @xcite .    to explain the mechanism of this equivalence we begin with the maxwell equations which in the presence of a material have the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the electric field , @xmath13 is the magnetic field , @xmath14 is the magnetic induction , @xmath15 and @xmath16 is an eigenfrequency with the wave vector @xmath17 . we suppose that the material has a magnetic anisotropy corresponding to an anisotropic permeability @xmath18 with @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 and eq(3 ) @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the magnetomechanical factor",
    ", @xmath23 is the magnetization of the material , @xmath24 and @xmath25 characterizes the anisotropy type : it is an easy plane anisotropy for @xmath26 and an easy axis anisotropy for @xmath27 . in what follows",
    "we suppose that the material has an easy plane magnetic anisotropy , @xmath26 , in which case the intrinsic magnetic field is equal to @xmath28 on the relations ( [ omega12 ] ) @xmath29 is the angle between the anisotropy axis @xmath30 and the magnetization @xmath31 .",
    "we choose the latter to coincide with the @xmath32 axis along the magnetization , while the @xmath33 axis lies in the plane spanned by the vectors @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in the simplest case of an easy plane magnetic material we have @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 , so we obtain from ( [ omega12 ] ) @xmath37 this is shown in fig .",
    "[ scisfig1 ] where the @xmath32 axis is perpendicular to the plane of the waveguide .    ) filled with ferrite where @xmath38 is the magnetization of ferrite and @xmath30 is the anisotropy field . ]",
    "we seek a two - dimensional solution of the maxwell equations ( [ maxwell ] ) shown at this figure in the form @xmath39 .",
    "the fields @xmath40 lay in the plane @xmath41 and depend on @xmath41 too .",
    "then the first equation is satisfied , while the third one gives @xmath42 and finally , the fourth maxwell equation can be rewritten as @xmath43 using the explicit form of the permeability given by ( [ chi ] ) we get @xmath44 combining this with eq .",
    "( [ maxwell3 ] ) we obtain @xmath45 where we have denoted @xmath46 substituting eq .",
    "( [ he ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ maxwell4 ] ) we obtain @xmath47 the key observation is that the mixed derivatives in the last equation can be eliminated by the coordinate transformation @xmath48 which allows us to cast eq .",
    "( [ mix ] ) into the following simple form @xmath49 where @xmath50 we have taken into account that @xmath51 holds in accordance with ( [ mixchi ] ) .",
    "the transformation ( [ trans ] ) defines a relation between a right - angle cross structure and a skewed one with an angle defined by @xmath52 .",
    "it is too daring , however , to speak about a full equivalence , because it is clear from the formulas expressing the elements of ( [ chi ] ) that the angle depends on the eigenfrequencies involved .",
    "let us ask under which conditions this dependence of the geometrical factor ( [ lambda0 ] ) can be suppressed . substituting into ( [ lambda0 ] ) the expressions ( [ omega120 ] ) we get @xmath53 following to @xcite we can simplify this expression if to assume that @xmath54 for typical ferrites @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite . taking the magnetomechanical factor @xmath57 we obtain from([kgmh ] ) @xmath58 what would require very wide waveguides of a width @xmath59 .",
    "however , there are ferrites with @xmath60 which lead to the inequality @xmath61 . hence in this case we are able to use standard waveguides",
    "the width of which is of order 1  cm",
    ". then we can simplify the geometrical factor of the waveguide to the form @xmath62 this formula gives a remarkable possibility to change the angle of the scissors @xmath63 by means of an external magnetic field applied along the magnetization direction .",
    "moreover if to apply strong magnetic field @xmath64 or @xmath65 , then it follows from formula ( [ lambda2 ] ) that @xmath66 on this case also the effective angle of the structure can be tuned by variation of the external magnetic field .",
    "first we review some general properties of the bound states which can be derived by the standard methods of dealing with laplace operator with dirichlet boundary conditions , the dirichlet - neumann bracketing @xcite and eigenvalue variation with respect to the change of the domain @xcite .",
    "the problem has two mirror symmetries with respect to the axis of the angle @xmath0 which we call scissor axis , and with respect to the axis of the larger angle @xmath8 which we call the second axis . using the mentioned methods together with an eigenvalue - in - the - box estimate analogous to that employed in @xcite we find that    \\(i ) every bound state is even w.r.t . the scissor axis ,    \\(ii ) with respect to the second axis the bound states can have both parities which are alternating if the bound states are arranged according to their energies ,    \\(iii ) as @xmath0 becomes smaller new bound states emerge from the continuum .",
    "the number @xmath67 of bound states satisfies the inequality @xmath68 with @xmath69 . while it is not good around @xmath1 , where we know that @xmath70 from @xcite , it is asymptotically exact as @xmath71 ,    \\(iv ) all the bound - state energies are monotonously increasing functions of @xmath0 .",
    "the angle dependence of the bound - state energies has different regimes . in the weak - coupling regime",
    "when the scissors are closing and just passed the critical angle @xmath9 at which a new bound state appeared , our numerical analysis shows that the binding energy of the weakly - coupled states behaves as @xmath10 with some constant @xmath72 which depends on the particular state . on the other hand ,",
    "strongly bound states corresponding to a small @xmath0 are in the leading order determined by the one dimensional potential well given by the lowest transverse eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "the second axis determining the parity of the solution is then deep in the classically forbidden region , so we can conclude that    \\(v ) as @xmath0 becomes smaller the bound states group into pairs with opposite parities and the energy gap between them is exponentially small as @xmath71 .    after these general results let us pass to the numerical solution .",
    "we use three different methods .",
    "the most common among them is the boundary integral method @xcite . in combination with the above general results , it provides a rather complete information about the discrete spectrum .    on the other hand ,",
    "the boundary integral method tells us nothing about the scattering problem in the scissor structure .",
    "we are interested in particular in the scattering resonances associated with quasibound states , which are characterized of complex values of energy at which the analytically continued resolvent has a pole singularity . a suitable method to treat",
    "this problem is the exterior complex scaling .",
    "the method was suggested in the seminal paper @xcite and has developed into an efficient computational tool ",
    "see@xcite and reference therein .",
    "the use of exterior complex scaling for waveguide structures was first proposed in @xcite , here we employ it in the form presented in @xcite . before the proper scaling we pass to right - angle scissors by means of the coordinate change @xmath73 which takes the hamiltonian to a unitarily equivalent operator acting as @xmath74 now we apply the scaling transformation to the longitudinal variable in the structure arms which leaves the central area unchanged , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which yields the scaled hamiltonian @xmath77 + u(x , y)\\ ] ] with    @xmath78    and @xmath79 the function @xmath80 can be chosen , e.g. , as @xmath81 with @xmath82 larger than the channel halfwidth and the interpolating function @xmath83 such that @xmath84 for @xmath85 , the function @xmath80 is three times differentiable and the inverse map @xmath86 exists .",
    "as long as as the parameter @xmath0 is real , the above transformation is a simple coordinate change which does not change the spectrum . however , if @xmath0 assumes complex values we observe a different behavior in the discrete and continuous part typical in such situations @xcite : each branch of the continuous spectrum of the operator ( [ ham ] ) is rotated into the complex plane giving @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath89 the rotated branches point to the lower half plane and reveal parts of other sheets of the riemann surface of energy and we are able to see the resonance poles as complex eigenvalues of the transformed operator ; the corresponding eigenfunctions are after the transformation decaying at large distances , instead of the original growing oscillations typical for gamow functions .",
    "finally , the third method is based on application of infitesimally small time - periodic perturbation .",
    "the bound states with energies below the propagation subband ( @xmath90 ) do not participate in stationary transmission .",
    "however , it is possible to mix the bound state @xmath91 with propagating state @xmath92 via a time - periodic perturbation @xmath93 provided that the matrix elements of the perturbation @xmath94 .",
    "such a possibility was demonstrated for the four - terminal s hall junction for electron transmission effected by a radiation field @xcite .",
    "later the mixing of bound states with propagating modes was also realized in microwave transmission @xcite .",
    "here we similar to @xcite use the time - periodic perturbation ( [ timeperturb ] ) as a probing one to find the bound state energy by resonant features in the transmission probability .",
    "let us show the results of numerical analysis based on the methods described above .",
    "first we plot the bound state energies as a function of the scissor angle @xmath0 .",
    "the results of complex scale method are presented in fig .",
    "[ scisfig2 ] by points .    .",
    "the complex scaling method data are shown by points .",
    "the boundary integral method data are shown by circles .",
    "the asymptotic formulas ( [ limit ] ) with corresponding quantum numbers @xmath95 are given by thin solid lines .",
    "insets above show blow up of asymptotic behavior of the bound state energies in the vicinity of bottom of propagation band @xmath96 . ]",
    "the results of boundary integral method are shown in fig .",
    "[ scisfig2 ] by circles . for the limit @xmath97",
    "the energies of bound states are derived in @xcite and have the following form eq(22 ) @xmath98\\ ] ] where the quantum numbers @xmath99 .",
    "the factor @xmath100 in ( [ limit ] ) takes into account that the length of an inscribed rectangle has a length twicely more than in the case of bent waveguide studied in @xcite .",
    "insets above the figure show blow up of asymptotic behavior of the energies in the vicinity of the edge energy band @xmath101 .",
    "for all energies of bound states the asymptotics are @xmath102 where @xmath72 is a constant .    as it was discussed in the introduction as the angle @xmath0 diminishes and the states become strongly bound , the energy gap between the even and odd member of the pair vanishes exponentially fast .",
    "in fact , one can see in fig .",
    "[ scisfig2 ] that the second bound state energy approaches to the first one , the fourth bound state energy approaches to the third one , and so on . in fig .",
    "[ scisfig3 ] ( a , b )      the first even - even and the second odd - even bound states are shown .",
    "one can see that we have typical quantum mechanical task of double well potential @xcite in which an energy distance between the first and second energy levels becomes exponentially small with growth of a potential barrier between wells .",
    "[ scisfig3 ] ( c , d ) demonstrates the next pair of the bound states in the scissor structure .",
    "usually the bound state transforms into the quasibound state which displayes as resonant dip or peak for transmission through the structure as it was observed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "however as one can see from fig .",
    "[ scisfig4 ]      numerical computation of the transmission through the scissor s structure does not show any resonant features for @xmath105 .",
    "also we used the time - periodic perturbation method to search the quasi boun+ state above @xmath9 .",
    "the results of computation are in the vicinity of critical angle @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ scisfig5 ] .    ) as the angle of the scissor @xmath0 increases .",
    "the evolution exactly follows to a blow up shown in inset of fig .",
    "[ scisfig2 ] for @xmath106 . for the angle exceeding @xmath9",
    "resonant feature is decayed .",
    "dashed vertucal line shows the edge of the propagation band @xmath101 . ]",
    "one can see that for @xmath107 we have resonant features caused by mixing of propagating mode with the bound state of the time - periodic perturbation .",
    "however for @xmath108 these resonant features do not evolve but only decay with increasing of the angle @xmath109 .",
    "the small wiggle around the value 9.8704 is an artefact of the computation which diminishes with the decrease of @xmath110 .",
    "moreover for @xmath0 approaching @xmath9 the transmission probability @xmath111 undergoes the following feature as shown in fig .",
    "[ scisfig4 ] .",
    "the less a value @xmath112 the more a slop of the transmission versus @xmath104 in the vicinity of @xmath113 . for @xmath114 the derivative @xmath115 .",
    "if to plot @xmath113 at which the transmission is reaching half as shown by circles in fig .",
    "[ scisfig4 ] versus the angle of scissor waveguide we obtain remarkable curve shown in fig .",
    "[ scisfig6 ] .",
    "we see that a value @xmath113 equals zero just at the critical angles .",
