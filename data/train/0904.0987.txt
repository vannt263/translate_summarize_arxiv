    "objects of astrophysical origin such as soft-@xmath0 repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars are believed to be neutron stars with strong magnetic fields and constitute an example of the so called _ magnetars _ @xcite . on their surface magnetic field strengths",
    "can be of the order @xmath1 g. according to the scalar virial theorem @xcite allowed field strengths could be , in principle , as big as @xmath2 g , however , a full detailed study of the gravitational stability condition of the maximum sustainable magnetic field strength in a star remains to be done .",
    "description of low temperature homogeneous fermion systems was developed by landau in 1957 @xcite with the characterization of the low energy properties of the system in terms of a set of parameters , i.e. , the landau parameters , which determine the effective interaction of two quasiparticles at the fermi surface . since then , there have been many attempts to characterize nuclear and neutron matter as a fermi liquid . even if the general framework of the fermi liquid theory ( flt ) is well defined , the microscopic derivation of the landau parameters in the context of nuclear liquids is not yet fully solved and their values depend on many - body effects and details of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction that need to be treated carefully .",
    "microscopic calculations of landau parameters for nuclear and neutron matter for realistic interactions have been subject of several investigations @xcite .",
    "these calculations have also been evaluated in the framework of effective interactions , which allow for a hartree - fock description of the system and for a clean definition of the quasiparticle excitations . in this context",
    "they have been calculated for symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite .    from the astrophysical point of view the importance of flt",
    "is due to the fact that it constitutes an excellent tool to study the properties of matter in the interior of neutron stars where the low temperature approximation is relevant . in the solid outer crust ,",
    "the picture of non - superfluid neutrons is adequate , however , at higher densities in the crust one should consider a finite pairing gap energy @xcite . in this non - superfluid scenario",
    "one could approximate , at these densities , the fermion system in the very neutron rich astrophysical object as formed by pure homogeneous neutron matter as that described by the flt .",
    "due to the presence of strong magnetic fields in these objects the possibility of magnetized matter must be taken into account .    in a previous contribution we analyzed the effects of a strong magnetic field of astrophysical origin in a neutron gas  @xcite . there , we found that using different parametrizations for the non - relativistic effective nn interaction such as skyrme and gogny forces , in the context of hartre - fock calculations , a net magnetization is energetically allowed .",
    "one should notice that effective nuclear interactions such as skyrme forces predict that even in the absence of a magnetic field an spontaneous magnetization at sufficiently high densities may arise @xcite .",
    "however , modern calculations using realistic nn potentials such as the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc ) method @xcite , lowest order constrained variational ( locv ) method @xcite , brueckner - hartre - fock @xcite , relativistic mean field @xcite or relativistic brueckner - hartre - fock @xcite , which have studied the energetics of spin polarized neutron matter in the absence of magnetic fields , seem to prevent an spontaneous ferromagnetic phase transition and therefore there is the tendency to consider this fact as a pathology of the model used for the effective interaction .",
    "notice also that the modern finite range gogny effective interactions do not predict this instability @xcite . in any case",
    ", the transition into a ferromagnetic state could have important consequences for the evolution of a protoneutron star , in particular , for the spin correlations in the medium which do strongly affect the neutrino opacities inside the star @xcite .",
    "for lower densities , as those in the outer crust , microscopic calculations for the non - homogeneous _ pasta _ phases @xcite and the spin response in the presence of strong magnetic fields need to be fully calculated .",
    "therefore it is interesting to study neutron matter in the presence of a strong magnetic field or with net polarization . as a first step in the description of the system , besides its energetics , which has already been discussed in a previous publication @xcite , we will study the landau parameters of the polarized neutron matter , characterized for having two fermi spheres corresponding to the two possible spin orientations of the neutrons .",
    "this study requires the use of an extension of the flt to a two component system , which is presented in section [ formalism ] , together with the derivation of the landau parameters for two parametrizations of the nuclear interaction , namely effective skyrme and gogny forces . using a multipolar expansion of the particle - hole matrix elements we will examine",
    "the landau s fermi liquid parameters up to dipolar order .",
    "other magnitudes such as isothermal compressibility and spin susceptibility will be also analyzed .",
    "results will be presented in section  [ results ] , and summary and conclusions will be given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in this section we briefly review the basic formalism of the normal flt @xcite for a homogenous neutron system in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "we consider a uniform magnetic field in the z - direction , @xmath3 which also defines the quantization axis for the spin .",
    "in such a fermionic system particles can have spin projection on the z - axis , @xmath4 , which can be either @xmath5 or @xmath6 for spins aligned parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "let us remind here that for a neutron the magnetic moment is antiparallel to the spin .",
    "the neutron number density , @xmath7 , is the sum of spin up ( @xmath8 ) and down ( @xmath9 ) particles , @xmath10 these densities define the fermi momenta , i.e. , the fermi surface of each fermion component with spin projection @xmath4 . at zero temperature",

    "note that previously we have used @xmath22 to designate the magnetic field strength , however , the total magnetic field is the sum of the external magnetic field and the induced magnetization , @xmath23 . in this work",
    "we will assume that the ratio @xmath24 will always be close to unity . in what follows we will keep the notation using @xmath22 to designate the total magnetic field strength .",
    "in the context of flt it is assumed that ph excitations happen around the fermi surface , so , this treatment is valid , in principle , for the low temperature regime where @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "then , there is a one - to - one correspondence of states in the interacting system with states in a free fermi gas . as particles with given momentum @xmath26 and spin projection @xmath4 are added addiabatically to the system , an eigenstate of the real gas is obtained and , thus , a distribution of quasiparticles , @xmath27 .",
    "since the lifetime of the quasiparticle varies inversely to the square of the departure of its energy from the fermi energy @xcite we will consider that the ph perturbation mechanism takes place around the available polarized fermi seas .",
    "asuming small deviations of the distribution function of the @xmath4-polarized quasiparticles in the plasma , @xmath27 , with respect to the ground state distribution , @xmath28 we have @xmath29 .    in the flt",
    "the variation of the free energy , @xmath30 , can be written up to secon order in @xmath31 as , @xmath32 as seen on @xcite the change in free energy under the presence of a magnetic field is due to the energy of ( anti)alignement of spins in the field and to the change in the quasiparticle distribution function .",
