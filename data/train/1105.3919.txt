    "heavy - ion physics is an integral part of the baseline experimental programme of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "after normal operations have been established , the lhc is running for about 8 months per year with proton beams and for one month per year with nuclear beams .",
    "three of the four experiments ( alice , atlas and cms ) participate in the lhc nuclear beam programme .",
    "so far , only collisions with pb nuclei are firmly scheduled , while operational plans for proton - nucleus ( ) collisions are still preliminary . however , the lhc is a versatile hadron collider that allows , in principle , the collision of asymmetric ( a+b ) nuclear beams .",
    "all three lhc experiments have included collisions in their physics performance studies and have discussed their importance .",
    "the proton - nucleus programme serves a dual purpose .",
    "it provides , on the one hand , baseline measurements for the nucleus - nucleus program .",
    "experience from previous heavy ion programs ( cern sps , rhic ) shows that a baseline is essential for the interpretation of some of the main discoveries ( e.g. @xmath1-suppression , jet quenching , ... ) .",
    "this document identifies an analogous need for collisions at the lhc .",
    "a programme also offers unique possibilities for specific investigations in various domains of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "this document presents an updated description of : i ) the accelerator issues for collision of asymmetric systems at the lhc ; ii ) the uncertainties in nuclear parton distribution functions and benchmark cross section for hard processes ; iii ) the new opportunities made available to study parton saturation , ultra - peripheral collisions and measurements , which are of interest to astrophysics ; and iv ) the experimental issues related to the special conditions of the run .",
    "the main conclusions of this document are the following :    * preliminary considerations indicate the feasibility to run the lhc in mode without major modifications of the machine .",
    "we consider here a canonical situation in which the energy of the run ( @xmath2 tev ) corresponds to the charge - over - mass ratio scaling with respect to the proton top lhc energy .",
    "the estimated luminosity is @xmath3@xmath4s@xmath5 for collisions .",
    "asymmetric collisions imply also rapidity shifts with respect to the and systems .",
    "this effect can be reduced by colliding deuterons with nuclei instead of protons .",
    "the realisation of the d+a mode , however , needs significant hardware modifications of the injector chain . *",
    "the knowledge of nuclear parton distributions is deficient for the kinematics accessible at the lhc .",
    "this has negative consequences for the interpretation of the data and a run is indispensable for benchmarking : for most of the duration of the lhc programme , a run will be the only experimental possibility to reduce systematic uncertainties arising from yet unmeasured parton distributions . in this document we study possible constraints from different processes . assuming a running time of @xmath6 the corresponding integrated luminosity of 0.1 pb@xmath5 will make the measurements considered in this document feasible .",
    "a significantly smaller integrated luminosity will compromise the performance for several observables . on the contrary ,",
    "an increase in luminosity by a factor of 10 will be beneficial for observables with the smallest cross sections , especially those involving high-@xmath7 photons and heavy bosons .",
    "* collisions at the lhc offer unique possibilities for the study of small-@xmath0 physics with nuclear targets , extending the kinematically accessible regime by several orders of magnitude in @xmath0 and @xmath8 from those presently available .",
    "this provides an excellent opportunity for the study of the saturation of partonic densities .",
    "other physics opportunities include ultra - peripheral ( electromagnetic ) collisions and measurements of cross sections of interest for cosmic ray physics .",
    "* the lhc experiments have proven capabilities to exploit the physics opportunities of a run at the quoted luminosity .",
    "for some observables , running at the same nucleon - nucleon centre - of - mass energy as would have the advantage of reducing systematic uncertainties for benchmark perturbative processes .",
    "further reduction of the uncertainties , for the case of rapidity asymmetric detectors , necessitates operation of both and modes . for nuclear pdf and small-@xmath0 studies ,",
    "the largest possible energy is preferred .",
    "this document provides important arguments for the timely scheduling of runs .",
    "with the lhc , high - energy nuclear collisions have reached the tev scale for the first time .",
    "this has opened up a discovery regime , which is currently being vigorously explored exploiting the first long run with collisions at @xmath9= 2.76 tev .",
    "the corresponding first results on multiplicities , elliptic flow , jet quenching and other observables have been published  @xcite .",
    "the top lhc energy of @xmath10=5.5 tev exceeds that of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) by almost a factor of 30 .",
    "the increase in centre - of - mass energy will be even larger for collisions ( @xmath10=8.8  tev ) .",
    "this large jump in energy translates into a kinematical reach in bjorken-@xmath0 and virtuality @xmath8 that is several orders of magnitude beyond that achieved in all other previous experiments with nuclear collisions .",
    "based on the current understanding of nucleus - nucleus collisions , there are in particular two classes of questions where the extended kinematic reach of the lhc is expected to give access to qualitatively new phenomena .",
    "i ) hard probes are produced at unprecedented rate at the lhc .",
    "the established strong sensitivity of these hard probes provides a promising and diverse method for a detailed characterization of the properties of the produced dense qcd matter ; ii ) much smaller momentum fractions @xmath0 become relevant for particle production . on the one hand , the large parton densities at small-@xmath0",
    "are expected to make the system initially produced in the collision denser , hotter and thus longer lived . as a result , a characterization of parton distributions at small-@xmath0 is important for the understanding of the initial conditions from which dense qcd matter emerges  as also demonstrated by the first particle multiplicity data @xcite showing striking scaling features with respect to the smaller energy ( rhic ) data . on the other hand ,",
    "the dense initial partonic system is of interest in its own , since one expects to access with increasing @xmath11 a novel high density regime of qcd in which parton distributions are saturated up to perturbatively large virtualities . as discussed in this document ,",
    "measurements of proton - nucleus collisions are crucial for exploiting the opportunities of these two classes of measurements at the lhc .",
    "normalization runs with proton - nucleus ( p+a ) collisions have long been recognized as a crucial component of the lhc heavy - ion program . more generally , this is because the characterization of signatures of the qcd matter created in heavy ion collisions relies on benchmark processes with elementary collision partners , in which final - state medium effects such as collective phenomena are largely absent .",
    "to some extent , such benchmarking can be done with data from proton - proton collisions which characterize production processes in the absence of both initial and final state medium effects . however , to disentangle the initial state effects from those final state effects which characterize the properties of the produced dense qcd matter , proton - nucleus collisions are crucial .",
    "the absence of strong final state medium effects in proton - nucleus collisions provides a unique opportunity for characterizing the nuclear dependence of parton distribution functions at a hadron collider .",
    "this benchmarking of the initial conditions is of particular importance for heavy - ion collisions at the lhc , since e@xmath12a dis data will not be available any time soon for a large range of the kinematically relevant small-@xmath0 values .",
    "beyond benchmarking , proton - nucleus collisions are also expected to provide access to qualitatively new features of the small-@xmath0 structure of matter .    since the last extensive discussions of proton - nucleus collisions at the lhc @xcite , significant experimental and theoretical developments have occurred in this area . in particular , the technical challenge of running a hadron collider in an asymmetric mode has been mastered at rhic , where deuterium - gold measurements have provided the decisive benchmark experiments for discoveries in the corresponding nucleus - nucleus program .",
    "the extrapolation of these results allow us now to substantiate statements about the required luminosity and experimental coverage for a successful proton - nucleus normalization run at the lhc .",
    "further , recent theoretical developments in studying the energy evolution of quantum chromodynamics at high parton densities and small-@xmath0 have added significantly to the physics case for a proton - nucleus run at the lhc .",
    "in fact , a growing physics community has started to work towards a dedicated electron - nucleus collider for elucidating the small-@xmath0 structure of matter  @xcite .",
    "the question arises to what extent proton - nucleus runs at the lhc can help to prepare and complement such a future large scale project .",
    "the purpose of this document is to provide a brief update of our current understanding of how the lhc could operate in mode , how a proton - nucleus run could be exploited to optimally support a successful heavy - ion programme at the lhc , and which additional scientific opportunities arise from proton - nucleus collisions at the lhc .",
    "although proton - nucleus collisions ( ) at the lhc had been discussed in the physics community for some years , they were not formally included in the initial `` baseline '' lhc machine design  @xcite , which included only symmetric and collisions .",
    "the mode of operations ( as well as collisions between lighter ions ) was considered as an option , to be studied and implemented later .",
    "the rationale for this at the time was twofold :    * the need to focus available resources on what was needed for the startup of the lhc . *",
    "the baseline modes of operation are the most difficult in many respects .    with the lhc starting to explore the and physics programmes , a need to investigate the feasibility of the mode of operation of",
    "the lhc appears .",
    "meanwhile some concerns have emerged from the experience gained at rhic . in this document",
    "we have tried to respond to these concerns with a preliminary study of the feasibility and potential performance .",
    "rhic operated with deuteron - gold collisions ( ) in 2003 and 2008 @xcite .",
    "the 2003 run was the first for an asymmetric hadron collider , and faced several challenges .",
    "some relevant to the lhc proton - ion programme include multi - species injector performance , setup time constraints , injection with equal rigidity vs. equal revolution frequency between the two beams , and collision geometries of dissimilar species . at rhic",
    "a proton - gold run was considered but required either large deviations in the arcs or movement of the common dx magnets .",
    "so , the option of a more symmetric charge - over - mass ratio as in a colliding system was adopted .",
    "careful attention should be given to dual - species injector performance and reliability , particularly since any bottleneck will significantly impact the performance of short lhc runs .",
    "injector emittance and intensity development ultimately limited rhic performance during the 2003 run .",
    "later improvements in injector au performance for dedicated operations provided the basis for the 2008 run , which delivered six times the integrated luminosity of that in 2003 .",
    "rhic took 18  days of development to first collisions , and an additional 20  days to the start of physics development .",
    "this time included the development of new acceleration/@xmath13-squeeze ramps ( see below ) and about 6  days of detector setup operations .",
    "the lhc setup will likely be shorter since lhc and will precede operations .",
    "early in the rhic 2003 run , injection and ramping setup were changed from the same magnetic rigidity in both rings to the same rf frequency in both rings  this was necessary to avoid beam - beam modulation and serious beam losses ( up to 50  % of stored beam ) during injection and ramping , even with interaction region beam separations of 10 sigma .",
    "for the lhc , beam - beam compensation and transverse dampers should be investigated , perhaps with modifications , to control emittance growth and beam loss from this mechanism .",
    "the collision geometry of the lhc for should be studied for asymmetries , in conjunction with the lhc experiments .",
    "the rhic run required swaps of power supply shunts on dx dual - ring magnets to satisfy the orbit geometry requirements of different @xmath14 species in each ring .",
    "this created a @xmath15 collision angle within the experiments , marginally affecting detector acceptances .",
    "for the reasons given above , only preliminary considerations on lhc filling for or operation have been made .",
    "the injector chains for protons and ions are distinct at the low energy end , i.e. , the initial linac and the first synchrotron .",
    "clearly , as much as possible of the existing lhc injector chains must be used to allow proton ( deuteron)-ion operation of the lhc at a reasonable cost .",
    "we assume that one of the two lhc rings will be filled with ions featuring the nominal bunch pattern for ion - ion operation .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the second lhc ring must be filled with protons or deuterons in the _ same nominal ion _ bunch pattern",
    ". the `` lazy '' solution , to fill the other ring with the usual bunch pattern and to have at least some encounters at the interaction points ( but some ion bunches may never collide with a proton bunch ) , would have many disadvantages and is not envisaged .      assuming that one lhc ring is filled with a nominal pb - ion beam ( bunch population , emittances , filling pattern ) and that the proton bunches have the same geometric beam sizes and bunch pattern , an intensity of the order of @xmath16  protons per bunch is needed to reach the required luminosity of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "the lhc ion ring will be filled using the standard ion injector chain in the standard way ( yielding the nominal lhc ion bunch pattern ) .",
    "the problem consists in finding a scheme that allows the lhc proton ring to be filled with protons in the same bunch pattern as the ions .",
    "two distinct schemes have been identified ( although many more probably exist ) .",
    "each of them uses the lhc proton injector chain but applies longitudinal gymnastics that are very different from nominal proton filling .",
    "* the first scheme is based on the experience with generation of lhc ( proton ) pilot bunches in the ps booster .",
    "every booster ring provides one bunch per cycle and each of these bunches corresponds to one lhc bunch ( no bunch splitting along the rest of the chain ) .",
    "these bunches are injected into adjacent ps buckets .",
    "the harmonic number of the ps ( @xmath18 may be a good choice ) is chosen so that the bunch spacing is sufficient for the psb recombination line kicker .",
    "the ps harmonic number must be increased gradually to @xmath19 to obtain the right 100  ns bunch spacing and the 40  mhz and 80  mhz rf systems must be used to shorten the bunches before ejection towards the sps .",
    "the four bunches provided per ps proton cycle correspond to the four ion bunches per ps ion cycle .",
    "the rest of the lhc injector chain is very similar ( accumulation of up to 13  injections on an sps low energy plateau , acceleration and transfer to the lhc ) for proton and ion filling and even slightly simpler ( no stripping in the transfer line between ps and sps and , thus , a higher magnetic field in the sps , no `` fixed '' frequency non - integer harmonic acceleration needed for protons ) .",
    "* the second scheme aims at faster filling of the lhc proton ring .",
    "every bunch provided by the ps booster corresponds to one leir / ps ion cycle and , thus , has to provide four lhc proton bunches .",
    "this scheme requires more elaborate longitudinal gymnastics than the first one ( but they are still simpler than the gymnastics applied routinely in operations to provide , e.g. , the beam for lhc operation ) .    at a first glance ,",
    "the proton beam needed for ion - proton operation of the lhc can be provided by the injector chain at a reasonable cost and without major hardware upgrades .",
    "schemes for filling one lhc ring with deuterons have been given only very preliminary consideration . in principle",
    ", one could imagine one of the following two scenarios :    [ [ deuterons - via - the - ion - injector - chain - linac-3-and - leir ] ]   deuterons via the ion injector chain ( linac 3 and leir ) : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in order to provide both ions and deuterons via the ion injector chain , sufficiently fast switching between these two species at the low energy part of linac3 would be required .",
    "furthermore the radio - frequency quadrupole ( rfq ) used for ions would not perform well for deuterons .",
    "thus , a dedicated deuteron rfq , adjusted to higher input particle velocity and voltage for extraction from the source , would be necessary . in summary",
    "it is clear that a dedicated deuteron source and rfq and a switchyard allowing switching between ions and deuterons is the minimum requirement .",
    "[ [ deuterons - via - the - proton - injector - chain - linac2-psb ] ]   deuterons via the proton injector chain ( linac  2 psb ) : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    linac4 will replace the present linac2 as ps booster injector from 2015 on , so this option will not be available after that time .",
    "the ps booster will then be converted for @xmath20 charge exchange injection so deuterons for the lhc would have to be produced from @xmath21 injection . whereas the simple drift tube structure of linac2 could , in principle , accelerate @xmath21 ( with a velocity half that of protons ) , this is not the case for linac4 which consists of three different accelerating structures .",
    "a dedicated @xmath21 source and rfq would be needed in any case and represents a significant investment .",
    "using linac2 for @xmath21 acceleration would have limited impact on proton beams for other facilities .",
    "these very preliminary investigations lead to the conclusion that the injector chain can not be upgraded for lhc deuteron - ion operation without major hardware upgrades and investments ( in equipment and manpower ) .",
    "further detailed investigations are needed to confirm whether either of the schemes outlined above is feasible . in any case , deuterons in the lhc will require several years lead time .",
    "the lhc differs from rhic in its two - in - one magnet design , a single magnet ring with two beam apertures , rather than the two rings of independent magnets of the brookhaven machine . with asymmetric beams in the machine",
    "this difference is crucial and determines many key beam parameters and experimental conditions .    for definiteness",
    ", we consider the case of protons colliding with lead ions ; the case with other beams is analogous .",
    "the lhc accelerates protons through the momentum range @xmath22 since the magnetic field is equal in the two apertures , there is a relation ( equal magnetic rigidity ) between the momenta of proton and lead ion : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 for fully stripped pb ions .",
    "while this places many constraints on operation , it does , on the other hand , simplify some aspects : the geometry of the beam orbits does not change at all so there are no complications with separation magnets ( c.f .",
    ", the movement of `` dx '' magnets to adjust the collision geometry in rhic ) .",
    "the centre - of - mass energy and central rapidity shift for colliding nucleon pairs within ions @xmath26 , and @xmath27 @xmath28 are direct consequences of the two - in - one magnet design via ; see also table  [ tab : rootsy ] .",
    ".beam energy per nucleon , @xmath29 , center - of - mass collision energy per nucleon , @xmath10 , and central rapidity shift , @xmath30 , of colliding nucleon pairs for maximum rigidity colliding beams in the lhc ; @xmath30 is in the direction of the lighter ion .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     because of , the two beams have different speeds and revolution periods on nominal orbits of the same length .",
    "the rf systems of the two rings of the lhc are perfectly capable of operating independently at the different frequencies required during injection and ramping",
    ". however they must be locked together at identical frequencies in physics conditions to keep the collision points between bunches from moving .",
    "this forces the beams onto distorted , off - momentum orbits of different lengths but identical revolution periods .",
    "the amplitude of the distortion remains within the limits considered acceptable for the lhc only for @xmath31 .",
    "this imposes a lower bound on possible collision energies .    at lower energies , therefore",
    ", the beams necessarily have different revolution periods .",
    "each pb ion bunch encounters up to 5 or 6 proton bunches as it traverses one of the straight sections around the lhc experiments where the two beams circulate in a common beam pipe . at injection energy ,",
    "these encounter points move along the straight section ( in the direction of the proton beam ) at a rate of 0.15  m per turn .",
    "they then disappear into the arcs only to re - emerge a few seconds later in the next experimental straight section .",
    "as the main bend field is ramped up , this motion slows down , finally freezing when the energy is high enough that the rf frequencies can be locked together . a re - phasing operation ( known as `` cogging '' ) to peg the collision points in their proper places may still need to be carried out ( although it may be possible to arrange the timing so that this takes place in the last part of the ramp ) .    during injection and ramping the bunches",
    "are separated in all the common sections of the lhc so that they never collide head - on but nevertheless have some long - range beam - beam interaction .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that the separation is sufficient that the magnitudes of these interactions , expressed either as kicks or parasitic beam - beam tune - shifts , are very small .",
    "the strength of the corresponding `` overlap knock - out '' resonances  @xcite is also relatively small . for these reasons",
    ", it appears unlikely that the moving beam - beam encounters will have the severe consequences experienced in analogous conditions at rhic ( see above ) and , earlier still , at the isr  @xcite .",
    "however this is a tentative conclusion requiring more detailed justification .",
    "moreover , the lhc , unlike rhic , will have the benefit of four independent transverse feedback systems , one per plane and per ring , with bandwidth high enough to act on individual bunches .",
    "this promises to be a powerful tool in damping any coherent motion induced by the moving encounters .",
    "the moving encounters might also affect the operation of those beam position monitors that see both beams .",
    "some modifications of their electronics may be necessary in order to implement appropriate signal gating .    with the fairly conservative assumptions of bunches of @xmath32 pb ions ( nominal intensity for the mode ) colliding with bunches of @xmath33 protons ( 10% of the nominal mode intensity ) , with the usual beam emittances , optics and bunch train structure for pb beams , a typical initial peak luminosity would be @xmath34 performance beyond this level",
    "might be attainable with , most likely , higher proton bunch intensity .",
    "however it should be remembered that runs at the lhc are likely to be rather short , with limited time available to maximise performance . on the other hand , by the time",
    "a run is scheduled , operational procedures ought to be well - established and smooth .",
    "more concrete luminosity projections will come from deeper studies and , most importantly , initial experience of running the lhc with proton and nuclear beams .    for a given luminosity ,",
    "this choice of the maximum possible number of bunches is more likely to generate some cancellation among multiple , weaker , moving parasitic encounters .",
    "however alternative sets of parameters ( e.g. , half the number of nominal intensity pb bunches against the same number of @xmath35 proton bunches ) , would lead to similar luminosity .",
    "these could be of interest if the total pb intensity is limited because of collimation inefficiency ( e.g. , before the proposed dispersion suppressor collimators are installed in the collimation insertions ) .",
    "the question of switching the directions of the p and pb beams has been raised .",
    "this is perfectly feasible .",
    "clearly the experimental advantages would have to be weighed against the set - up time ( presently hard to estimate ) during a short run .",
    "if only one direction is possible , it appears that all experiments would prefer  or accept  protons in ring 1 and pb ions in ring  2 .    in conclusion",
    ", preliminary studies since have found no major obstacles , in terms of hardware modifications or beam dynamical effects , to colliding protons and lead nuclei in the lhc with adequate luminosity .",
    "however further studies of the beam dynamics are essential to demonstrate the feasibility of what will probably be the most complicated mode of operation of the lhc .",
    "historically , the benchmark role of ( or at rhic ) collisions has been essential for the interpretation of the heavy - ion results . at rhic ,",
    "two main examples arise : i ) the absence of suppression in the transverse momentum spectrum of the inclusive hadron production  @xcite proved the jet quenching hypothesis as the genuine final - state effect at work to explain the observed deficit of high-@xmath7 hadrons in collisions  @xcite ; ii ) the moderate suppression of the @xmath1 at central rapidities  @xcite contrasts with the stronger suppression predicted by models extrapolating from sps data , affecting the interpretation of the corresponding hot nuclear matter effects in . at the cern sps ,",
    "the experimental data on several systems at different energies are fundamental for the interpretation of the results on @xmath1 suppression in collisions  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear modifications of the production cross sections for hard processes in compared to p+p collisions are studied here with special emphasis on those involving large virtualities .",
    "predictions for cross sections with different degrees of nuclear effects are collected .",
    "these processes are expected to provide key measurements of the validity of qcd factorization in nuclear collisions as well as constraints on the nuclear parton distribution functions .",
    "the qcd factorization theorem @xcite provides a prescription for separating long - distance and short - distance effects in hadronic cross sections . the leading power contribution to",
    "a general hadronic cross section involves only one hard collision between two partons from the incoming hadrons with momenta @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the cross section can be factorized as @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 runs over all parton species and all scale dependence is implicit .",
    "the @xmath40 are twist-2 distributions of parton type @xmath41 in hadron @xmath42 ( parton distribution functions , pdfs ) and the @xmath43 are fragmentation functions for a parton of type @xmath44 to produce a hadron @xmath45 .    in the nuclear case",
    ", the incoherence of the hard collisions implies that the nuclear pdfs ( npdfs ) contain a geometric factor , so that the hard cross sections are proportional to the overlap between the two nuclei .",
    "the degree of overlap can be estimated experimentally in a probabilistic approach proposed by glauber  @xcite .",
    "this fixes the baseline , i.e. the `` equivalent number of collisions '' , @xmath46 , to which the central cross section measurements are compared , to quantify the effects on such observables of the hot and dense matter .",
    "the glauber model is , however , not a first - principles calculation and experimental checks of this model are of utmost importance for the interpretation of the main results expected in the runs .      equation ( [ twist2conv ] ) reveals the need for a precise knowledge of the pdfs for the lhc physics programme . for the proton case ,",
    "the pdfs are constrained by a large number of data  especially from hera and the tevatron  in global fits performed at lo , nlo or nnlo .",
    "in the nuclear case , much less extensive experimental data on nuclear dis are available in the perturbative region ( @xmath47 1 gev@xmath48 ) , only for @xmath49 . as a result , there are large uncertainties in the npdfs relevant for lhc kinematics . the most recent versions of the npdfs global fits at nlo are eps09 @xcite , hkn07 @xcite and nds @xcite  also schienbein _ et al . _",

    "moreover , the most recent data from @xmath50-production at the lhc @xcite also show good agreement with the factorization assumption although errors are still moderately large . in spite of these successes , the gluon distribution remains poorly constrained for the nucleus , as can be seen in fig .",

    "the experimental data from collisions at rhic have already proven to be an appropriate testing ground for npdfs studies : as mentioned before , data on inclusive production at high-@xmath7 has been included in global fits , providing constraints for gluons ; npdfs are also extensively used in phenomenological studies of hard probes at rhic . on the other hand , the strong suppression found in forward rapidity hadron data",

    "this ambiguity is avoided in p+a collisions because the photon is most frequently emitted by the heavier nucleus . thus measuring @xmath132 as a function of @xmath100 corresponds to measuring the energy dependence of the photoproduction cross section .",
    "exclusive vector meson photoproduction has been studied in upcs at rhic by star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite .",
    "the lhc p+a measurements would be extremely valuable as a ` benchmark ' for understanding similar upc a+a data and measuring nuclear shadowing .",
    "the ratio of cross sections @xmath135 $ ] at the same @xmath136 allows for a rather direct measurement of nuclear shadowing .",
    "the a+a data provides the numerator while the p+a data are used in the denominator .",
    "many theoretical and experimental systematic uncertainties cancel in the ratio .",
    "last but not least , the cross section for the electromagnetic proton dissociation reaction in the field of the nucleus , p+pb  @xmath137  pb+x , can be reliably calculated ( @xmath138 uncertainties ) and thus usable as `` luminometer '' .",
    "ultraperipheral d+au interactions along with electromagnetic deuteron dissociation have been measured at rhic , with a cross section of @xmath139  =  1.99 b @xcite , and compared to theoretical predictions  @xcite to directly determine the luminosity needed to calibrate the cross sections of other processes produced in d+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "photon - photon interactions in upcs at lhc energies can access a rich qcd , electroweak , and even beyond the standard model ( bsm ) programme at the tev scale . in the qcd sector , double vector meson production @xmath140  @xcite , will be accessible with similar rates in and collisions .",
    "in addition heavy flavor meson spectroscopy can distinguish between quark and gluon - dominated resonances , search for glueballs  @xcite , and study @xmath141 spectroscopy through radiative @xmath1 decays with larger rates than in direct @xmath142 production  @xcite .",
    "qed dilepton production is also of interest as a luminosity monitor  @xcite . in cms",
    "@xcite , the castor / totem forward detectors can measure low-@xmath7 @xmath143 pairs , corresponding to large impact parameters , where theoretical calculations are most reliable .",
    "higher - order qed corrections are expected to reduce the huge dielectron cross sections in pb+pb upcs ( @xmath144  b ) .",
    "the p+pb data could provide experimental verification of the predicted deviations from the @xmath145 scaling expected for symmetric ion - ion collisions , as yet unobserved at rhic or the sps .",
    "tagging forward protons at the lhc with roman pots will enhance the detection capability of electroweak processes , improving the background suppression .",
    "the addition of far - forward detectors at @xmath146  m @xcite would improve forward light - ion detection , allowing events to be double tagged . a process well suited to testing the electroweak ( @xmath114ww ) gauge boson self - interaction is single w photoproduction @xcite from a nucleon in ultraperipheral and   @xcite collisions .",
    "similarly , 10 @xmath147 events are expected in a @xmath60 s run .",
    "these @xmath148 pairs , characterised by small pair @xmath7 , are sensitive to the quartic gauge boson couplings .",
    "lastly , even higgs boson production would be measurable if the luminosity were increased by a factor of 60  @xcite .",
    "current cosmic - ray data reveal a rapid increase of the average mass number @xmath149 of the cosmic - ray flux  i.e. a transition from lighter ( p , he , ... ) to heavier composition  in the energy range around @xmath150  ev in the laboratory frame , coinciding with a steepening of the cosmic - ray flux . in the energy range around @xmath151",
    "ev there are indications that the composition becomes lighter again , correlated with a hardening of the spectral slope of the cosmic - ray flux .",
    "the most recent data from the pierre auger observatory points to yet another change back to a heavier composition in the highest energy range @xmath152 ev @xcite .",
    "a precise determination of this quantity would have a profound impact on the knowledge of the sources of the high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "direct measurements of the cosmic - ray mass number @xmath42 are possible only up to @xmath153  ev . above this",
    "energy attempts to infer the @xmath42 of the primary particle are based on the measurements of the extensive air shower ( eas ) induced when the cosmic ray interacts upon entering the atmosphere .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in the predictions of the eas observables stems from our limited knowledge of the features of hadronic interactions in this energy range , in particular at forward rapidities , where most of the energy of the shower flows .",
    "in fact , none of the existing hadronic interaction models currently used for modeling eas development @xcite is able to provide a consistent and satisfactory description of cosmic - ray data due to the unconstrained extrapolations from energies reached at accelerator based experiments .",
    "in this situation , data from the lhc helps to constrain these models and to improve the interpretation of cosmic ray measurements  @xcite .",
    "in particular , a proton - nucleus run would be of utmost importance since the eas are predominantly generated in collisions of the cosmic - rays with nitrogen and oxygen nuclei in the upper atmosphere .",
    "the measurements of particle production at very forward rapidities , accessible to existing lhc detectors such as the zero - degree - calorimeters  @xcite and the lhcf  @xcite experiment , are therefore of special importance .",
    "in fig . [ fig : expkin ] the expected kinematical regions measured in the @xmath154 plane for different processes or @xmath155 processes . if @xmath156 kinematics is relevant , as e.g. in drell - yan production or in inclusive hadron production in the cgc approach , the relevant values of @xmath0 may become significantly smaller . ]",
    "accessible with an integrated luminosity of 0.1 pb@xmath5 in a run are plotted inside the band indicating the maximum kinematical reach .",
    "also shown in the same figure is the reach of the current data used to constrain the present knowledge of nuclear pdfs .",
    "the rest of the phase space to be studied at the lhc is basically unconstrained with regard to nuclear effects .",
    "notice that the band corresponding to rhic kinematics has to be compared with the total kinematic reach of the lhc , as the region accessible with actual processes , is , in fact , much smaller @xcite .",
    "this clearly illustrates the wide new region opened at the lhc for both benchmarking perturbative processes in a+a collisions , and for the new physics opportunities discussed in this report .",
    "the lhc detectors are designed to run under the much more demanding conditions of and high - luminosity collisions .",
    "extensive studies of the detector capabilities and performance , including runs , are available @xcite , which include discussion of the centrality determination in and performance for various observables .",
    "we focus here on topics related to the rapidity shifts and the energy interpolations for benchmarking as well as the need of and collisions during the same running period .",
    "the luminosity quoted in this document , @xmath59@xmath4s@xmath5 , is expected to be sufficient to carry out the proposed measurements and matches the detector capabilities .",
    "assuming an effective running time of @xmath60  s , the total integrated luminosity is 0.1 pb@xmath5 .",
    "any significant reduction of this quantity would significantly impair the measurement of some of the observables  e.g. electroweak boson ( @xmath114 , @xmath55 and @xmath50 ) production  for benchmarking or other physics studies as explained previously in the text .",
    "on the other hand , a larger luminosity would allow one to measure with high enough precision other relevant observables such as @xmath50+jet , important for jet calibration in jet quenching measurements and for npdf studies .",
    "benchmarking in is essential for all perturbative studies relevant for the programme at the lhc .",
    "the usual procedure is to study ratios between the or cross sections with the corresponding one scaled by the appropriate factor .",
    "this is , in principle , the same procedure to be used at the lhc .",
    "one of the questions is how to produce such ratios , when the energy of the collision is different for different colliding systems , as it is the case for the top lhc energies in , and  .",
    "ideally , benchmarking runs at the same energy have to be done .",
    "this possibility has been explored in a short run at @xmath157 2.76 tev in 2011 with an integrated luminosity of around 20 nb@xmath5 for alice and about a factor of 10 larger for cms and atlas .",
    "these luminosities are of the same order as the ones considered here and should provide the needed conditions for benchmarking without theoretical input . in the absence of data at the same energy as the or the runs , interpolations among different energies will be needed through a ratio of the type  @xcite @xmath158 where @xmath159 depends on the process under consideration . however , the accuracy of this interpolation is process dependent .",
    "uncertainties are quite small @xmath160 for the hardest processes , e.g. electroweak boson production , but are usually larger otherwise",
    ". for example they are 12% ( 8% ) in charm ( beauty ) production when extrapolating from @xmath161 tev down to @xmath162 tev @xcite . at the time of the run",
    "some of these uncertainties could be further reduced through constraints arising from the program .",
    "different observables could need slightly different benchmarking strategies depending on the theoretical or experimental capabilities to isolate different nuclear effects if present  for example modifications in the hadronization .",
    "for those effects solely depending on a modification of the pdfs in the nuclear environment , the use of ratios with respect to and the corresponding interpolation ( [ eq : interpolationpp ] ) is strictly speaking not essential , especially if quantities not depending on the knowledge of the proton pdfs can be built , see e.g. @xcite . in general",
    "the same consideration applies for factorization in the fragmentation functions when computing e.g. inclusive particle production at high transverse momentum . in this case , good control over the normalization of the cross sections would significantly improve the comparisons as well as allow for precision checks of the glauber model .    in this document",
    "a canonical energy for a run of @xmath2 tev has been considered .",
    "this means that a second interpolation to the maximum energy will be necessary .",
    "the potential problem for this second interpolation lies on the possible energy dependence of effects which are not factorizable in terms of nuclear pdfs . with the present knowledge from rhic and sps",
    ", this will be especially relevant for quarkonia production  in this case a run at the same energy of the one would be preferred . for other observables such effects are not expected . for nuclear pdf studies and for the new physics opportunities quoted in this document , the highest energy run would be more interesting , also for a reduced systematic uncertainties , if data at the same energy are not available .",
    "notice that constraints for pdfs in a given range of @xmath0 are stronger if the kinematical limit is not reached .",
    "a second independent effect which needs to be taken into account is the rapidity shift .",
    "this rapidity shift , @xmath163 , will be present irrespectively of the energy of the run .",
    "this is especially relevant for detectors which are not symmetric in rapidity . in that case , the ideal running conditions for benchmarking would be to have both and collisions during the same running period .",
    "a fast enough switch between the two modes would , in this case , be a requirement for a successful run .",
    "the integrated luminosity used in this document for benchmarking purposes is 0.1 pb@xmath5 .",
    "any substantial reduction of this quantity would alter the performance of some of the measurements presented here , in particular those involving electroweak processes and large virtualities as mentioned above .",
    "a luminosity larger by a factor of @xmath164 , on the other hand , would give access to new important observables .",

    "<S> proton - nucleus ( p+a ) collisions have long been recognized as a crucial component of the physics programme with nuclear beams at high energies , in particular for their reference role to interpret and understand nucleus - nucleus data as well as for their potential to elucidate the partonic structure of matter at low parton fractional momenta ( small-@xmath0 ) . here , </S>",
    "<S> we summarize the main motivations that make a proton - nucleus run a decisive ingredient for a successful heavy - ion programme at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and we present unique scientific opportunities arising from these collisions . </S>",
