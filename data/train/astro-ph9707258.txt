    "the pico dos dias survey ( pds ) is a systematic search performed at the pico dos dias observatory ( opd ; operated by lna / cnpq ) to discover young stellar objects . using the digitized sky survey ( dss ) , we have selected candidates brighter than magnitude 14 and declination @xmath24 , associated to iras sources which were chosen following specific color criteria ( gregorio - hetem et al . 1992 ; torres et al .",
    "1995 ) . high resolution ( 0.7  ) spectra of all the candidates were then taken using the coud spectrograph at the 1.6 m telescope , centering the spectra near h@xmath25 .",
    "photometry was also performed using fotrap ( jablonski et al .",
    "1994 ) , a fast photometer installed at the 60 cm zeiss telescope of the opd .",
    "the survey is now complete and final results will soon be published , providing information on about 440 new sources .    in this letter ,",
    "we report the discovery of a new quasar .",
    "this object , which looks like a 14th magnitude star on the dss , is located at coordinates @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( astrometric positions , epoch 2000 ) and was given the number pds456 in our catalog .",
    "its peculiar position , at galactic coordinates l@xmath26 , b@xmath5 , near the bulge of our galaxy , may explain why this relatively bright quasar has escaped detection until now .",
    "a coud spectrum of pds456 was taken on may 12 , 1996 . on this spectrum",
    "we distinguished at least three broad emission lines suggesting that this object could be an agn ( either a seyfert or a quasar ) .",
    "the narrow wavelength coverage of this high dispersion spectrum did not allow us , however , to immediately identify the nature of these lines . on july 6 , 1996 three spectra",
    "were obtained with the cassegrain spectrograph of the opd . for this observation",
    ", we used a 900 l / mm grating blazed at 5000  , giving a resolution of about 3  .",
    "one spectrum was taken with five minutes exposure time and the two others with twenty minutes each .",
    "the extraction of the spectra was done with the tasks in the apextrac and oned packages in iraf .",
    "the combination of the three spectra is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the cassegrain spectrum of pds456 is typical of a luminous quasar .",
    "we identify the most prominent line with h@xmath8 corresponding to a redshift of @xmath27 .",
    "comparison with the spectrum of pg1700 + 518 ( wampler 1985 ) shows very similar characteristics .",
    "the feii lines are particularly strong and well resolved . if [ oiii]@xmath285007 is present , it is much weaker than the feii multiplets .",
    "this is consistent with the anticorrelation found by boroson & green ( 1992 ) between measures of feii and the [ ] .",
    "the analysis of such a complex spectrum is obviously not the goal of this letter .",
    "we did however a preliminary analysis using in iraf the routine deblend in splot to verify some hypotheses .",
    "we decomposed the h@xmath8 line by assuming two gaussian components : a broad and a narrow one .",
    "we did the same analysis for the broad emission feature at @xmath29   assuming that it was composed of the line at @xmath30   and of the [ ] @xmath9 line .",
    "the results are presented in table 1 .",
    "the errors were determined by repeating the measures 3 times , varying the level of the continuum and the starting position of the lines .",
    "the results of this analysis are consistent with the hypothesis that the feii lines have the same profile and same widths as h@xmath8 and suggest also that we do see a weak [ ] @xmath9 . the ratio @xmath31([]@xmath32 and",
    "the h@xmath8 luminosity l(h@xmath8)@xmath33 are in good agreement with the values predicted by the anticorrelation found by steiner ( 1981 ) .",
    "the  magnitudes of pds456 were obtained on 6 nights in april and may 1997 . during two nights we observed the quasar twice .",
    "the results are summarized in table 2 . in @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "the quasar seems constant , within the measurement errors . in @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "the variance is somewhat greater , but observations separated by three weeks show that the fluxes in these band do not vary by more than @xmath38% .",
    "to estimate the reddening in this region of the galaxy , we used the main diffuse interstellar bands present in our spectra ( herbig , 1975 , 1993 ) , which yields a@xmath39 mag .",
    "this is consistent with the value obtained using the equivalent widths of the interstellar line na d 1 , assuming that it has multiple components ( munari & zwitter , 1997 ) .",
    "our value for the reddening is also consistent with the value a@xmath40 mag based on the extinction maps of burstein and heiles ( 1982 ) .",
    "the extinction  corrected magnitudes and colors are given in column 3 of table 2 .",
    "we use a@xmath41 and seaton s ( 1979 ) expression for the reddening in our galaxy .",
    "the extinction  corrected colors are in relatively good agreement with the evolutionary path of colors of quasars at various redshifts as derived by cristiani & vio ( 1990 ) .",
    "the absolute b magnitude of pds456 was determined using the relation ( schmidt & green 1983 ) : @xmath42 ( using h@xmath21 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 and q@xmath22 ) . in this expression ,",
    "the k correction is given by @xmath43 and a@xmath44 is the correction for galactic reddening .",
    "we used @xmath45 in order to compare with the absolute magnitudes of the quasars in the vron ",
    "cetty & vron compendium ( 1996 ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of pds456 is @xmath46 . in figure  2",
    ", we compare pds456 with all the quasars in the list of vron  cetty & vron .",
    "the absolute magnitudes were reduced to the same cosmology and corrected for galactic reddening out of the disk using the expression ( lang 1980 ) : @xmath47 + 0.25 $ ] .",
    "a mean value of a@xmath48 was assumed in the disk ( @xmath49 ) . in the optical , pds456 is therefore @xmath50 more luminous than 3c 273 ( at z @xmath51 ) and the most luminous quasar up to a redshift of @xmath52 .",
    "pds456 is located in the center of the positional error ellipse of iras17254 - 1413 . according to the iras faint source catalog it was not detected at 100 @xmath10 m .",
    "the relatively flat spectral slopes @xmath12 and @xmath13 may suggest a low dust content . expressing the 60 @xmath10 m luminosity as ( green et al .",
    "1992 ) l@xmath53 , where d is the distance and @xmath54 is the flux in erg @xmath55 s@xmath7 yields l@xmath56 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "this is slightly higher than the mean value found by green et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for their sample of quasars .",
    "we also find a good match between the position of pds456 and the position of the x - ray source rxs j172819.3 - 141600 ( voges et al .",
    "1996 ) , which has a count rate of 0.3 count s@xmath7 in the [ 0.1 - 2.5 kev ] energy band . using the conversion factor 1 count s@xmath57",
    "as suggested by alcala ( 1994 ) for 1 kev ( @xmath58 hz ) , we estimate a median flux of 0.0015 mjy .",
    "this corresponds to an x - ray luminosity l@xmath59 erg s@xmath7 , which is a typical value for quasars .",
    "this result is also consistent with the anticorrelation between l@xmath60 and [ oiii]/h@xmath8 as found by grindlay et al .",
    "( 1980 ) for radio quiet quasars .",
    "the ratio @xmath61 is much lower than the mean for radio quiet quasars and much lower , in particular , than the ratio found for 3c 273 ( @xmath62 ; green et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the spectral energy distributions of quasars display a wide variety of shapes ( barvainis 1990 ) . in a limited frequency range",
    ", it can be described as a power  law in frequencies f@xmath63 . in figure 3 , we combine the extinction  corrected magnitudes of pds456 with the iras fluxes and rosat x - ray flux to estimate the spectral indexes @xmath25 in the optical and @xmath64 from the optical to the soft x - rays . in the optical ,",
    "we find @xmath65 .",
    "this value is significantly flatter than usually found for quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies ( edelson & malkan , 1986 ) which confirms the suggestion given by the slopes in the infrared that this quasar is relatively dust free . from the optical to the soft x - rays , we find @xmath16 .",
    "this value is consistent with the mean value ( @xmath66 ; laor et al .",
    "1997 ) observed for radio quiet quasars .",
    "the characteristics in the optical , the infrared and x - ray as reported above all suggest that this is a radio quiet quasar .",
    "a recent radio survey in the region of pds456 did not detect any source to an upper limit of 42 mjy ( griffith et al .",
    "1994 ) . at the distance of pds456",
    "this upper limit corresponds to a power level at 4.85 ghz of @xmath67 .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude lower than the power threshold that separates radio quiet from radio loud quasars ( woltjer 1990 ) .",
    "all the studies on the distribution of quasars in space concluded that there is a strong evolution of their number density , their luminosity , or both between an epoch corresponding approximately to z@xmath68 and the present ( for a review see hartwick and shades 1990 ) .",
    "the pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model assumes that all the quasars were born at the same time and are becoming less luminous at the same rate .",
    "alternatively , the pure density evolution ( pde ) model assumes that the birth rate of the most luminous quasars may have been highest in the early universe and is steadily decreasing , while the birthrate of the least luminous ones has roughly been constant . in this context , it is intriguing to find a nearby quasar even more luminous than 3c 273 . indeed , using the hh1 model of schmidt and green ( 1983 ) , based on the bright quasar survey ( bqs ) , we find that the density @xmath69 of quasars as luminous as 3c 273 in the nearby universe ( z @xmath70 ) is only @xmath71 mpc@xmath72 .",
    "the expected number of such quasars in the nearby universe is @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , 3c 273 is an exception .",
    "therefore the fact that we just discovered another one suggests that our understanding of the local luminosity function , as deduced from the bqs , is not satisfactory .",
    "a recent comparison of the hamburg / eso survey ( he s ) with the bqs by khler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) implies that the surface density of bright quasars in the nearby universe is much higher than previously estimated .",
    "this result confirms previous claims by wampler & ponz 1985 and goldshmidt et al .",
    "1992 . using the luminosity function of khler et al . and extrapolating up to the absolute magnitude of pds456 we find a density @xmath73 mpc@xmath72 .",
    "this means that in a volume of space including pds456 we could find as many as 9 quasars as luminous as this one .",
    "our discovery supports khler et al",
    ". claims , which is that the evolution of the most luminous quasars in the universe probably proceeded at a lower rate than usually predicted by the ple model .",
    "we would like to thank carlos henrique veiga from the observatrio nacional who determined the astrometric coordinates of pds456 and j. e. steiner for interesting discussions and suggestions .",
    "we would like to thank also the staff at the opd for their support during our survey .",
