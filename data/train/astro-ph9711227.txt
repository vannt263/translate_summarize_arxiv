    "classification of galaxies has long been regarded as an important step toward understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "there is considerable evidence that the two main methods of classification  morphological and spectral  both directly reflect physical properties of galaxies ( roberts & haynes  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed it was clear early on that these two methods yield galaxy types which are strongly correlated ( morgan & mayall  @xcite ) , although recent work shows that the correlation is not perfect ( connolly  @xcite ; zaritsky , zabludoff & willick  @xcite ) . in preparation for large galaxy catalogs such as",
    "the sloan digital sky survey efforts have begun to automate both approaches to classification .",
    "morphologically - based schemes must of necessity deal with pixel images , and the most promising technique employs artificial neural networks ( e.g. , odewahn  @xcite ; folkes , lahav & maddox  @xcite ) .",
    "spectral schemes , on the other hand , require no more information than is already available in a typical redshift catalog .",
    "furthermore , the interpretation of a spectral type is facilitated by the direct connection between spectral features and the physics of the stars and gas within the galaxies .",
    "the information contained in a set of galaxy spectra can be extracted in an efficient manner by a principal component method ( e.g. , connolly  @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is to identify features of the spectra which show the greatest variation from galaxy to galaxy , so that a classification scheme can reflect those physical properties which maximally distinguish galaxies .",
    "we here apply the principal component method to analyze the galaxies in the las campanas redshift survey , a large multiple - strip survey with over 25,000 measured spectra .",
    "the goal of the work described here is not only to define spectral types but to begin discerning general physical properties of the galaxies in each type .",
    "we focus on the luminosity function , an important constraint for models of cosmic structure formation .",
    "we begin with a review of the lcrs catalog (  2 ) , then , in section  3 , we outline the principal component method and compare our classification scheme with previous work . in section  4",
    "we present our analysis of the luminosity function according to spectral type .",
    "the las campanas redshift survey is described in detail in shectman  ( @xcite ; hereafter ) .",
    "lin et al.(@xcite ; hereafter ) provide additional details related to galaxy selection .",
    "we summarize characteristics of the survey briefly in this section .",
    "the survey consists of @xmath926,000 galaxies in six sky strips , three strips in the northern galactic cap region and three in the southern region .",
    "each strip runs approximately 80  across the sky in right ascension and has a width in declination of @xmath91.5 .",
    "the mean strip declinations are 3 , 6  and 12  in the northern sample and 39 , 42  and 45  in the south .",
    "each sky strip was subdivided into 50 or so fields of square or nearly square dimensions .",
    "galaxies in each field were selected on the basis of kron - cousins @xmath0-band magnitudes ; a subset of these galaxies were chosen randomly for spectroscopic study using multiobject fiber spectrometers of either 50 or 112 fibers .",
    "apparent magnitude limits vary from field to field , with typical isophotal limits of @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the 50-fiber and 112-fiber fields , respectively .",
    "additional limits were imposed on the basis of `` central surface brightness '' of the galaxies , corresponding approximately to the flux entering a fixed fiber aperture of 3.5@xmath12 ; the limiting central magnitude is in the range of @xmath13 to 19 , depending on the isophotal magnitude .",
    "this additional cut ( a feature common to all magnitude - limited surveys , whether quantified or not ) amounts to a 20% reduction in the fraction of galaxies in the 50-fiber fields and less than a 10% reduction of the 112-fiber fields .",
    "we emphasize that each field has assigned to it a unique set of parameters which include isophotal magnitude limits , central magnitude cut , and `` sample fraction '' of the total galaxies in that field for which spectra were observed . as in ,",
    "we take full account of these field - to - field differences .    the individual spectra range from 3350    to 6750    for the 112-fiber data and from 3350    to 6400    for the 50-fiber data .",
    "the wavelength resolution is @xmath14    ( fwhm ) and the sampling rate is 2.5    per channel .",
    "as discussed below , we consider a narrower range of wavelengths to allow the redshifted spectra to be rescaled into a common waveband in the rest frame .",
    "we work with the full catalog of 25,327 galaxies to perform the spectral classification in the next section .",
    "following , our analysis of the luminosity function in ",
    "[ sect : lf ] makes use of only those galaxies with absolute magnitudes between 23 and 16.5 and with redshifts such that @xmath15  .",
    "we also exclude the 50-fiber data because of their more stringent surface brightness cuts .",
    "this leaves 18,105 objects , 8228 in the north and 9877 in the south .",
    "the same labeling scheme appears here as in , so , for example , n112 refers to the northern 112-fiber data .",
    "toward quantitative classification of the lcrs catalog we seek a representation of the spectra which accentuates the differences between individual galaxies .",
    "such a representation is afforded by singular - value decomposition ( svd ) as part of a principal component analysis ( see kendall  @xcite ) .",
    "the overall strategy is to express the spectra in terms of a series of templates  following connolly  ( @xcite ) we call them `` eigenspectra''and to select those which are most sensitive to galaxy - to - galaxy variations .",
    "the coefficient obtained by projecting a galaxy s spectrum onto such an eigenspectrum can serve as its spectral type .",
    "singular - value decomposition gives the general prescription for how to build the eigenspectra ; principal component analysis demonstrates that they indeed characterize those properties of the galaxies which optimally distinguish them .",
    "let the vector @xmath16 represent the spectrum of the @xmath17 galaxy in a catalog of @xmath18 objects .",
    "the components of the vector , @xmath19 , are integrated fluxes in frequency channels , where @xmath20 is the channel index .",
    "the full catalog then is a matrix @xmath21 of size @xmath22 where @xmath18 is 25,327 and the number of channels , @xmath23 , is 800 .",
    "we first preprocess the spectra in this matrix by weighting each wavelength channel using a smoothed version of the mean spectrum in the observatory - frame ( this step downweights those wavelengths where the instrumental response is low ) .",
    "we then normalize the weighted spectra to some constant flux value .",
    "next , the data are shifted into the rest frame and high - pass filtered to remove fluctuations in the spectra which have power on scales of @xmath91000    or more .",
    "finally we subtract off the average of the filtered spectra ",
    "we want the power in the eigenspectra to reflect differences between galaxies , not their similarities .",
    "it is this normalized , shifted , high - pass filtered entity which we call the catalog , @xmath21 .",
    "we can write the matrix @xmath21 in the form = ^t  , where @xmath24 is a row - orthogonal @xmath25 matrix , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both @xmath28 ; the former is diagonal with elements @xmath29 and the latter is orthonormal ( cf .",
    "press  @xcite ,  2.6 ) .",
    "this equation is the singular - value decomposition of @xmath21 .",
    "it is generally valid for all matrices provided that the number of columns does not exceed the number of rows , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "notice that any single spectrum @xmath16 from the catalog can be easily reconstructed from the matrices @xmath24 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 in : _",
    "i = _ j = 1^m _ ij _ j where @xmath31 is the @xmath32 element of the product @xmath33 , and the vector @xmath34 is the @xmath35 column of @xmath27 .",
    "this property highlights the special significance of @xmath27 : its columns define orthonormal vectors @xmath36 ...",
    "@xmath37 , the eigenspectra which form the basis used in a principal component analysis .",
    "the defining characteristic of such a basis is that it diagonalizes the covariance matrix of the catalog ,    rcl & & ^t  , + & = & ^t ^t ^t  , + & = & ^2 ^t  ,    ( note that @xmath38 ) . projecting the expressions in onto the eigenspectra explicitly demonstrates that @xmath39 is diagonalized , leaving the eigenvalue equation _",
    "i = _ i^2 _ i  , where @xmath40 is the @xmath17 diagonal element of @xmath26 in .",
    "there may also be value in weighting individual data points differently , depending on measurement errors or prior assumptions about the data .",
    "thus , before calculating the svd , one may wish to write the elements of the catalog matrix as _",
    "ij g_i h_j _",
    "ij  , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are weight factors .",
    "a transformation of this type can describe the effects of the `` renormalization '' which we performed on the spectra in the lcrs catalog .",
    "a geometric interpretation of the eigenspectra is that they are aligned with the principle axes of the error ellipsoid corresponding to the scatter of points in the catalog .",
    "the eigenspectra with the largest eigenvalues ( the @xmath43 in ) indicate directions in the space of frequency channels where there is greatest variation between objects in the catalog .",
    "conversely , small eigenvalues correspond to directions along which the data show little variation .",
    "the idealization that data scatter is an error ellipsoid hints that a principal component analysis is best suited to systems where the data correspond to @xmath23 statistically independent gaussian variates .",
    "knowledge of the covariance matrix allows the original orthogonal basis in which the data are collected ( i.e. , frequency channels ) to be rotated into a new basis ( the eigenspectra ) to represent the data in terms of statistically independent coefficients ( the @xmath31 in ) .",
    "this rotation is the karhunen - love transform . in general , where higher - order correlations are possible",
    ", these coefficients will not necessarily be statistically independent .",
    "a data compression algorithm is evident from the geometrical interpretation above : simply keep only the first @xmath44 eigenspectra @xmath34 and coefficients @xmath31 which correspond to eigenvalues at or above a threshold @xmath45 ; all the rest correspond to modes along which the data show relatively small variation .",
    "our galaxy classification method follows just this strategy .",
    "the simplest scheme is to consider only @xmath46 , the dot product of the @xmath17 galaxy spectrum with the first eigenspectrum @xmath36 .",
    "the galaxies have the greatest variance with this coefficient and it alone may be sufficient to usefully define spectral type",
    ". then the values of @xmath46 could be partitioned into bins , with each bin corresponding to a unique type . here",
    ", we use the first two eigenspectra ( ) to define spectral type because the geometry of data - point scatter in the vector space of frequency channels is not exactly elliptical ; there exist correlations between coefficients such that the scatter of data points roughly forms an arc .",
    "we create distinct types by extending boundaries radially outward from a point at some distance from the arc .",
    "illustrates the six spectral types  here called `` clans''defined in this way .",
    "the boundaries were chosen so that each clan contains roughly similar pathlengths along a trajectory which runs along the central ridge of the arching scatter figure . in this sense",
    "the dimensionality of our classification scheme is one ; however , because of the non - gaussian nature of the data scatter , the classification parameter s trajectory lies in a two - dimensional projection of the principal component eigenvectors .",
    "= 6.0 in    = 6.0 in    the choice of clan boundaries as shown in were meant to capture the central peak in the density of the data scatter ( clan  2 ) , and the transition along the `` tail '' of the scatter diagram toward positive values of projection coefficients ( clans 35 ) .",
    "the remaining two clans ( 1 and 6 ) are defined to assess the outliers of the scatter diagram . we find evidence from the systematic trend in luminosity function shape with clan index (  [ ssect : lfbyclan ] ) that the outlier clans represent populations of galaxies with unique properties , as opposed to random scatter of galaxies in neighboring clans .    before analyzing astrophysical properties of the clan populations ,",
    "we discuss qualitatively the line and continuum features which appear in the eigenspectra .",
    "this will help place our classification scheme in the context of morphological classification and other spectral classification methods .",
    "recall that in deriving the eigenspectra , we subtract the mean spectrum of the 25,327 galaxies .",
    "thus the eigenspectra measure differential signal in continuum and line features .",
    "contains the mean spectrum of the lcrs galaxies along with the first four eigenspectra .",
    "the first eigenspectrum shows emission features in h  i , he  i , o  ii , o  iii , ne  iii , ca ( h  &  k ) and mg  i , as well as slight continuum `` absorption '' on the red side of the 4,000balmer limit . because the individual spectra are high - pass filtered , i.e. , flattened , the 4,000  break shows up as a sawtooth - shaped profile .",
    "some of the emission features  h@xmath47 and forbidden o  ii and o  iii lines  are direct indicators of physical processes , presumably in the interstellar medium .",
    "others , such as the ca  h  &  k lines and g - band complex lines , appear in `` emission '' primarily to compensate for spectra with weaker absorption than is exhibited in the mean spectrum .    evidently , the most significant spectral variation between galaxies is the degree of line emission .",
    "emission lines of oxygen and hydrogen balmer lines are expected from h  ii regions , while the diminished stellar absorption in the calcium lines indicate a young stellar population",
    ". therefore a positive projection coefficient from this eigenspectrum seems like a good indicator of star formation .",
    "indeed , the most prominent feature in the eigenspectrum , the [ o  ii ]  @xmath483727 line , is known to correlate with star - formation rate as well as morphological type ( kennicutt  @xcite ) . however , there are two caveats .",
    "the first is that better measures of star formation are known , specifically @xmath49 flux and the shape of the uv continuum , but both are outside of the waveband considered here .",
    "the second caveat is that it can be difficult to make a distinction between star - forming regions and agns or liners solely on the basis of the emission lines contained in the eigenspectrum .",
    "again , h@xmath50 measurements would have helped ( baldwin , phillips & terlevich  @xcite ; allen  @xcite ) .",
    "the fraction of objects with non - thermal spectra is expected to be small and therefore we hold to the interpretation that emission lines associated with the first eigenspectrum indicate star formation .",
    "below we present evidence ( fig .",
    "4 ) that agn spectra can be isolated , but using the coefficient of projection with the third eigenspectrum .",
    "the second eigenspectrum is primarily dominated by [ o  ii ] ( 3727   ) , [ o  iii ] ( 5007   ) , and h@xmath51 ( 4340   ) emission lines .",
    "it allows a fine - tuning of the line contributions in star - forming galaxies  there is tendency for galaxy spectra which have a large projection coefficient with the first eigenspectrum to couple with the second eigenspectrum as well .",
    "this correlation is manifested by the curvature of the data scatter in .",
    "the appearance of strong h@xmath52 emission in the eigenspectrum suggests that it positively correlates with star - forming h  ii regions at relatively high levels of excitation .    ultimately , the physical significance of the eigenspectra is best interpreted by examining the spectra which they represent . in",
    "we show the average spectra of objects in the six clans .",
    "a progression from clan to clan is clear and supports our interpretation that the most important spectral differences between galaxies lie in the amount of line emission .",
    "= 6.0 in    while not relevant to our present spectral classification scheme , the third eigenspectrum is noteworthy .",
    "it has the role of further fine - tuning specific line - emission features including [ o  ii ]  @xmath483727 , as well as continuum emission above 4000   .",
    "note that it shows strong absorption in h@xmath51 and h@xmath52 and an asymmetry in the ca  h&k troughs from h@xmath53 .",
    "the distribution of projection coefficients for this eigenspectrum is roughly symmetric except for a weak tail extending to large negative values , with a significant population  about 0.6% of the total ",
    "between three and seven standard deviations .",
    "the mean spectrum of these objects is shown in .",
    "the projection coefficients of the third eigenspectrum are negative for this population , hence it shows strong emission in the balmer series . with the pronounced , broad balmer lines and enhanced [ o  iii]/o [  ii ] , we interpret these objects as seyfert  1 galaxies ( cf .",
    "kennicutt  @xcite ) .",
    "= 6.0 in    the skewness in the distribution of projection coefficients steadily decreases with increasing eigenspectrum index . by the fourth eigenspectrum ,",
    "the distribution is nearly symmetric ( skewness is around 0.2 , as compared with 1.2 for the first eigenspectrum ) .",
    "this is reassuring because it suggests that the scatter in the higher - order eigenspectra is becoming more and more characteristic of gaussian scatter , and contains less information relevant to classification .",
    "a variety of spectral classification schemes for galaxies has been proposed in the literature , and recent examples include allen  ( @xcite ) , bershady  ( @xcite ) , zaritsky , zabludoff & willick ( @xcite ) and kurtz & mink  ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of these methods involve fitting to specific line features or to a predefined spectral template which includes these features .",
    "connolly  ( @xcite ) proposed a method which incorporates eigenspectra defined primarily from the data itself in a strategy very similar to the one used here .",
    "we begin this section by considering their technique .",
    "connolly  performed a principal component analysis of optical and uv data to classify galaxies according to the projection of their spectra onto eigenspectra .",
    "the eigenspectra were derived from a set of 10 templates , where each template is the average of spectra from a given morphological type , or class of starburst galaxy . since",
    "the number of frequency channels is large , over 2200 in their case , connolly  properly construct their correlation matrix using the space defined by the 10 templates , not the space of frequency channels .",
    "thus each `` data point '' is essentially a measure of how the flux is distributed among the 10 templates .",
    "connolly  also assign a variable weight to each template ( as in ) , but otherwise , the procedure is the same as in a `` standard '' principal component analysis .",
    "connolly  argue that their projection of the data onto the space of templates offers several advantages over the standard method , not the least of which is a reduction in computational load . in general , there is considerable savings in diagonalizing a @xmath54 matrix versus one of size @xmath55 ( although of rank 10 ) .    a nice way to view the differences between the method of connolly  and a standard principal component analysis is through the formalism of svd .",
    "the raw data , in this case a @xmath56 matrix formed of 10 vectors in the 2200-dimensional space of frequency channels , is projected onto the 10-dimensional space of templates simply with a matrix transpose operator .",
    "indeed , it is formally necessary to take the transpose of to interpret the matrices @xmath27 and @xmath26 in terms of eigenspectra and eigenvalues as we did earlier  this enables the data of connolly  to meet the requirement that the number of rows is greater than the number of columns .",
    "numerically , it is not at all necessary to work with the transpose .",
    "one simply performs the svd and pulls the eigenspectra out from the rows of the matrix @xmath24 in ( see press  @xcite , p.  66 ) .    in practice",
    "it may not be feasible to decompose a catalog matrix if the number of data points and the number of frequency channels are large compared with available machine memory . instead , one may calculate and diagonalize the covariance matrix directly without ever forming the catalog matrix . for this purpose",
    "we still recommend an svd algorithm .",
    "once the eigenspectra were defined , connolly  projected individual galaxy spectra onto them ; a classification scheme based on projection coefficients for the first two eigenspectra produced a spectral type that was strongly , but not perfectly , correlated with morphology .",
    "it should be noted that their eigenspectra are most responsive to the level of broadband continuum flux and to the discontinuities at 3600    and 4000   .",
    "in contrast , our eigenspectra are not sensitive to broadband continuum flux , as a result of high - pass filtering .",
    "the high - pass filter does admit signal from the 4000    break , which appears as a saw - tooth profile , hence the continuum break enters our analysis through its variability over a small number of frequency channels ( and not through the absolute broad - band flux on either side of the break ) , this suggests that a benefit of high - pass filtering is sensitivity to key continuum features with less stringent demands on the accuracy of absolute flux measurements .",
    "in contrast zaritsky , zabludoff & willick ( @xcite ) focussed on line features .",
    "they defined a 3-dimensional space based on ratios of line emission and absorption , projection onto stellar templates of young ( spectral type a ) and old ( k ) stars , and ratio of hydrogen to oxygen emission lines .",
    "a `` training set '' of spectra enabled the authors to determine the loci of points in this space which correspond to morphological types .",
    "they tested the distance from these loci as measures of type using an independent set of galaxy spectra , and they concur with connolly  that the correlation between spectral and morphological types is strong but not perfect .",
    "like connolly , zaritsky  make the important point that the lack of perfect correlation is not the result of flaws in the spectral classification scheme , but rather reflects an intrinsic property of galaxies .",
    "we emphasize that the present classification scheme is high - pass filtered , and is more sensitive to line features than the shape of the continuum . in this regard our approach is qualitatively similar to the method of zaritsky  indeed , two of their classification parameters , the ratio of absorption to emission features and the relative line strengths of hydrogen and oxygen , correspond directly to the first two eigenspectra presented in .",
    "the third parameter used by zaritsky , a combination of projection coefficients with a - star and k - star templates , evidently has relatively small galaxy - to - galaxy variance ( fig .  3 therein)this parameter is not highly effective as a type - discriminator .",
    "recently , kurtz & mink  ( @xcite ) devised a classification scheme which is based on direct estimates of the effects of survey selection , instrumental response and the astrophysics of line formation to model template spectra without recourse to a statistical approach such as the method used here .",
    "they found that their data could be described simply and accurately by a linear combination of an absorption spectrum and an emission spectrum , with the following physical interpretation : all galaxies exhibit the absorption spectrum generated by their constituent stellar populations , but many also have superimposed emission features from physically distinct h  ii regions .",
    "thus spectral classes may be derived simply from projection onto the emission - line template . a large fraction of the @xmath92,000 galaxies in their survey",
    "have spectra which do not project strongly onto this template ; the peak in the distribution of projection coefficients for our first eigenspectrum reflects just this behavior , although in a fair amount of scatter is evident about the peak .",
    "kurtz & mink have thus developed the idea that spectral classification can be efficiently accomplished with a single parameter associated with star formation .",
    "an early incarnation of this idea came from aaronson ( @xcite ) who considered the relative contribution of red and blue stars in galaxies : to a fair approximation , the mix of a and k stars can account for variations in the broadband colors of galaxies ( see bershady @xcite for a refinement of this idea ) .    despite the existence of essentially one - parameter classification methods based on the amount of star formation , virtually all schemes , including the one introduced here , have a working dimensionality of two or more , reflecting the difficulty in precisely quantifying the gamut of emission from star - forming regions with a single template .",
    "an alternative might be to project galaxy spectra onto a `` variable template '' ( i.e. , a large set of fixed templates ) which reflects subtle changes in spectral profiles as a function of star formation rate . here",
    "we essentially form such a variable template by working with a linear combination of the first two eigenspectra . given the similarities between our classification scheme and those for which morphological types have been considered , it is likely that the clans and morphological type are strongly correlated .",
    "thus we adopt the nomenclature of `` early '' and `` late '' types to refer to galaxies solely on the basis of clan membership , with low clan number corresponding to early types .",
    "we now proceed to consider the clan - dependence of galaxy properties ; the focus here is primarily on the luminosity function .",
    "in their comprehensive review , binggeli , sandage & tammann ( @xcite ) point out that the luminosity function of galaxies , @xmath57 , giving the distribution of galaxies as a function of absolute magnitude @xmath23 , should be defined in terms of galaxy types .",
    "they argue , as have others ( holmberg  @xcite seems to be the first ) , that galaxies of different morphological type have different luminosity functions .",
    "thus , we write the general luminosity function of the full lcrs catalog as",
    "_ g(m ) = _ c = 1 ^ 6 f_c _ c(m )  , where @xmath58 is the luminosity function for the @xmath59 clan , and @xmath60 is the fraction of all galaxies of the @xmath59 clan in some specified region of the universe .",
    "here we treat all luminosity functions as probability distributions , hence @xmath61 and the @xmath58 are normalized to unity upon integration over all absolute magnitude values in the range of interest : ^ _ dm ( m ) = 1  ; in our analysis @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    in principle , there can exist a universal luminosity function that applies to all galaxies without any dependence on local environment .",
    "a case can been made against universality , and we offer some ammunition for it here .",
    "binggeli  provide the starting point , the assumption that while the general luminosity function is not universal , the luminosity functions of the individual clans are .",
    "then , one can argue against universality if the clan luminosity functions differ from one another and if the relative clan population depends on local density as is observed ( dressler  @xcite ) .",
    "an implausible conspiracy would be required to maintain universality when the luminosity function varies with galaxy and the fraction of each type varies with local density . as a first application of the spectral classification scheme presented here , we address these issues of type dependence .",
    "we begin with an outline of the methodology .",
    "we estimate luminosity functions for the lcrs galaxies using a procedure which is almost identical to that described in .",
    "first , we apply the non - parametric estimator proposed by efstathiou , ellis & peterson  ( @xcite ) to obtain the unconstrained form of the luminosity functions .",
    "then we fit the data with schechter functions , ( m ) = c 10 ^ -0.4 ( + 1 ) ( -m ) ( -10 ^ 0.4 ( - m ) )  , where @xmath50 and @xmath64 correspond to the slope of the faint - end of the galaxy distribution and to a typical absolute magnitude , respectively , and @xmath65 is a normalization constant , c = . |^_m =  .",
    "note that absolute magnitudes are calculated on the basis of relativistic luminosity distances with cosmological deceleration parameter @xmath66 . as in",
    ", the results presented here are insensitive to the choice of @xmath67 in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 . to obtain physical quantities such as luminosity and space density",
    ", we must also fix the hubble parameter , @xmath68  km / s / mpc .",
    "where the quantity @xmath69 does not appear explicitly it has been set to unity .",
    "in addition to fitting the luminosity function with a parametrized form , we assess its `` natural '' shape with a nonparametric method . the nonparametric representation of choice is a step - wise function ( first - order spline or histogram ) of constant bin width @xmath70 in magnitude : ( m ) _ n = -^ _ n w_th(m- n m )  , where @xmath71 are constants , and @xmath72 is a tophat function of unit height and width , centered at the origin .",
    "of course we cut the summation so that @xmath73 lies between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , but even so , `` nonparametric '' evidently implies a large number of parameters .",
    "the weights @xmath76 in or the parameters of any model of a luminosity function  can be determined from a maximum likelihood analysis ( sandage , tammann & yahil  @xcite ) .",
    "define @xmath77 to be the probability of observing the @xmath17 galaxy in a catalog with an absolute magnitude @xmath78 , given that it is located at some specified redshift .",
    "this is equivalent to the fraction of such galaxies that could be observed given the catalog s minimum and maximum apparent magnitude cuts and other selection criteria .",
    "the likelihood that the full catalog of galaxies was observed , given their redshifts , absolute magnitudes , the survey window , is just the product = _ i = 1^n p_i  .",
    "the form of the luminosity function can be estimated by first guessing it and then functionally deforming it to maximize the likehood function in .",
    "if the number of parameters needed to determine the luminosity function s form is small , then a direct search of the parameter space quickly yields the best - fit .",
    "otherwise , as in the case of the nonparametric luminosity function in , the best fit can be obtained from iterative corrections using constraints from the derivative of @xmath79 with respect to the @xmath76 .",
    "uncertainties in the best - fit luminosity function are calculated either by directly mapping relative confidence levels from the likelihood function or by calculating elements of the covariance matrix .",
    "again , see efstathiou  or  for details .",
    "one virtue of the maximum - likelihood method is that it is insensitive to the density field  the probability @xmath77 represents the _ fraction _ of galaxies observable at a given magnitude and this quantity is independent of density as long as the luminosity function itself is not density - dependent .",
    "we are assuming for the moment that this is true , at least for the clan luminosity functions .    to complete the estimation of the general luminosity in",
    ", we need the number density of galaxies in each clan .",
    "since density factors out of the maximum - likelihood estimators , it must be estimated independently .",
    "we use the same prescription as in  to get the mean number density : n = _ i = 1^n  , where @xmath80 is the proper volume of the survey , the integral gives the luminosity selection function , and",

    "the remaining galaxies were weighted to compensate for the excluded objects of similar absolute magnitude .",
    "the weights were determined by comparison with the n112 subsample which has less stringent surface brightness selection . in the absence of direct measurements ,",
    "the results presented here and in  are not extrapolated to account for the 4% exclusion rate of the n112 subsample . to assess the systematic errors incurred by following this procedure , we examine the change in the faint - end slope of the clan luminosity functions from the n112 subsample with a number of surface - brightness cuts and make the extrapolation to a cut rate of zero .",
    "the results suggest that the surface brightness cuts only marginally affect the luminosity functions of the first three clans .",
    "for example , the best - fit faint - end slopes of these functions change by less than @xmath106 .",
    "the cuts do affect the luminosity function of the fainter galaxies in clans 4 , 5 and 6 to a greater degree ; the faint - end slopes are expected to shift systematically downward by 0.07 , 0.12 and 0.05 , respectively .",

    "note that the faint - end slope of the  fit is relatively flat , with @xmath107 .",
    "in contrast , the faint - end slope of the weighted sum is formally @xmath108 , which corresponds to the very late - type ( clan 6 ) galaxies .",
    "if one were to pull the faint - end slope from the behavior of the weighted sum in the range 18.5 to 17.5  mag , then the slope would be approximately @xmath109 , a value which is more in line with other redshift surveys ( e.g. , marzke  @xcite ) , as discussed below in  [ ssect : comprss ] .",
    "we conclude that the schechter parameterization of the general luminosity function is robust over a limited magnitude range near @xmath64 but can give highly misleading results when extrapolated to faint magnitudes .",
    "= 6.0 in    a refinement of the analysis that considers northern and southern populations separately preserves the general trend of faint - end slope with galaxy type .",
    "however , some of the clans , in particular clans 1 and 3 , show significant differences in the northern and southern subsamples .",
    "a similar situation is discussed in  for the estimation of a universal luminosity function from the full ns112 data : the error ellipsoids in the @xmath50@xmath64 plane overlap only at the 2-@xmath110 level .",
    "it is argued in  that the problem arises not from the faint galaxies but from the bright ones , which can modify @xmath50 if the schechter parameterization gives only an approximate fit .",
    "this would suggest that the surface brightness selection of the 112-fiber data is not the cause of the discrepancy .",
    "another possible source of the discrepancy is cosmic variance from large - scale structure and environmental effects .",
    "we examine this topic next , but we must bear the north - south differences in mind .      the density - morphology relation ( dressler  @xcite ; postman & geller @xcite ) quantifies the extent to which the mix of galaxy types changes as a function of local density . to examine this effect in the lcrs",
    ", its galaxies may be divided into high- and low - density subsets using the 3-dimensional redshift - space information . of the many possible ways of making this division we opt for a friends - of - friends algorithm ( huchra & geller @xcite ) to identify groups of objects in redshift - space .",
    "the objective here is to simply but unambiguously determine high density regions .",
    "we do not weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this choice except to say that while the method may misclassify some galaxies in small , high - density groups , it handles redshift - space distortions  particularly `` fingers of god''very well . with link parameters of 75  km / s in the plane of the sky and 500  km / s along the line of sight and a 4-object minimum group size ,",
    "the algorithm identifies about 35% of the total survey as grouped galaxies .",
    "note that the 50-fiber objects are included in the group - finding step so that we can link members of superclusters which may span more than one @xmath111 112-fiber field in the survey .",
    "once tagged , the objects in high - density regions are tallied and compared with their low - density counterparts .",
    "the results from raw number counts show clearly the density - morphology relation ; the last column of table  1 contains the fraction of 112-fiber members within each clan that inhabit high - density environments . over half of the extreme early - type galaxies ( clan 1 )",
    "are found in regions of high density , whereas these regions contain less than a quarter of the extreme late - type ( clan 6 ) objects .",
    "the changing mix of galaxy types with local density , although only crudely established here , clearly suggests that the general luminosity function is not universal .",
    "the analysis may be taken a step further to determine if the luminosity functions for the individual types are universal . using the same partition as above",
    ", we find that there is a significant density - dependence in the faint - end slope , at least for the early - type objects .",
    "the effect is quite pronounced in the clan-2 galaxies , with @xmath112 in low - density regions and @xmath113 in high - density regions .",
    "this effect and the density - morphology relation are considered in greater depth in a separate paper .",
    "incidentally , we have recalculated the general luminosity function @xmath114 taking into account the variation of the type - specific luminosity functions in high- and low - density regions .",
    "the result supports the conjecture by binggeli , sandage & tammann ( @xcite ) that the assumption of universality for the individual type - specific luminosity functions is still a reasonable approximation for estimating @xmath114 .      in many analyses of the luminosity function ,",
    "the faint - end slope @xmath50 from the schechter parameterization has provided the means to compare different galaxy populations .",
    "in several recent examples , the value of @xmath50 has been reported to be about 1 .",
    "for example , loveday  ( @xcite ) find @xmath115 from the optically selected stromlo - apm redshift survey , while marzke , huchra & geller  ( @xcite ) report @xmath116 in the cfa redshift survey .",
    "the autofib redshift survey of 1700 blue - selected galaxies ( ellis  @xcite ) and the red - selected century survey ( geller  @xcite ) both give similar values , with @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively .    as in the case of the lcrs",
    ", there is evidence that these reported values do not reflect the true behavior of the faint end of the general luminosity function .",
    "marzke  ( @xcite ) identify a population of sm and i m galaxies in the cfa survey which is expected to dominate the faint end with a slope of @xmath119 .",
    "more recently , sprayberry  ( @xcite ) , in their examination of blue - selected low - surface brightness galaxies , find a best - fit schechter parameter of @xmath120 .",
    "they also employ a model consisting of a schechter function for magnitudes brighter than a fixed cut - off value and a power law at fainter magnitudes ; the power law is constrained to match the schechter function at the cut - off point .",
    "the power - law index @xmath47 was determined to be @xmath121 , although taken alone , the three data points which constitute `` the faint end '' do not evidently track such a steep power law ( see fig .  6 therein ) .",
    "nonetheless , the data do suggest a significant excess of faint , low - surface - brightness galaxies over the predictions from a fit to the schechter parameterization .",
    "similarly zucca  ( @xcite ) demonstrate that the faint end of the eso slice project redshift survey is better represented by a pure power law of index @xmath122 which differs significantly from the value of @xmath118 that is inferred from fitting the luminosity function near @xmath64 .",
    "they find that this slope steepens to @xmath123 for galaxies with emission lines .",
    "additional evidence for a steep faint - end slope comes from driver  ( @xcite ) who measure galaxy number counts as a function of apparent magnitude in a deep image from the _ hubble space telescope _ wide - field planetary camera .",
    "they model the number count distribution of three groupings of galaxy types using the schechter parameterization and argue that late - type objects require some combination of a steep ( @xmath124  1.5 ) faint - end slope and evolution of the luminosity function in an attempt to reconcile both the ( high ) number counts and the ( low ) local density of faint objects ( e.g. , phillips & driver @xcite ) .",
    "there is no strong signal of a faint - end up - turn in the general luminosity function of the century survey as determined by geller  ( @xcite ) , just as in the type - independent analysis of the lcrs in .",
    "this is reassuring given the similarities between the waveband selection of the two surveys . yet despite these similarities , there are significant differences in the best - fit schechter parameters .",
    "the problem is likely triggered in part by the use of the schechter parameterization in the first place : the results of  [ ssect : lfbyclan ] suggest that the parameterization is not well - suited to describing the general luminosity function except over a narrow range of magnitudes . for example ,",
    "relatively small changes in the absolute magnitude range used in a fit can significantly alter the inferred parameters .",
    "a simple change in the _ bright _ magnitude limit from @xmath125 to @xmath126 _ decreases _ the best - fit @xmath50 for the lcrs from 0.7 to 0.85 .",
    "this example suggests that the discrepancy between the lcrs and the century survey seems to lie at the bright end of the luminosity function , and is not the result of missing faint galaxies .",
    "another explanation of the discrepancy between the lcrs and century survey results might come from the fact that the century survey encompasses the corona borealis supercluster and therefore may have a different mix of galaxy types as a result of the density - morphology relation .",
    "a better comparison with the lcrs results will be enabled with the forthcoming type - dependent analysis of the century survey ( kurtz  1998 ) .",
    "in this paper we have implemented a spectral classification scheme based on singular - value decomposition .",
    "the svd approach isolates the most significant variations in the spectra of a catalog with a set of orthonormal basis vectors , or eigenspectra .",
    "projection of individual galaxy spectra onto the two most significant eigenspectra yields coefficients from which galaxy types are determined .",
    "the method was applied to the las campanas redshift survey , and in that catalog we defined 6 spectral classes ( here called clans ) .",
    "the physical properties of each clan were interpreted in terms of star formation ; the known correlation between star - forming galaxies and morphological type ( kennicutt 1992 ) suggests that the clan index runs smoothly from early to late types .",
    "the eigenspectra derived from singular - value decomposition are also useful for finding galaxies with unusual spectral properties .",
    "the projection coefficients of the third eigenspectrum alone allowed us to isolate a distinct population of objects which we identify as seyfert  1 galaxies ( 0.6% of the total ) .",
    "as an application of the classification scheme presented here , we used spectral types to study the luminosity function of galaxies .",
    "a strong type - dependence is identified , as manifested by the faint - end slope , with @xmath50 ranging from about @xmath1270.5 ( early types ) to 1.8 ( late types ) .",
    "we include this type - dependence in the calculation of the general luminosity function and we identify a faint - end slope which rises steeply , with a power - law index of @xmath128 in the faint limit .",
    "furthermore , the general luminosity function exhibits a broad shoulder at an absolute magnitude of roughly 20 in the @xmath0-band .",
    "these two features are not both represented by the schechter parameterization . on the other hand ,",
    "the individual type - specific luminosity functions are mostly well - characterized by the schechter parameterization .",
    "small deviations from the model occur for the luminosity function of the extreme late - type galaxies , which show a slight excess at bright magnitudes .",
    "the lcrs galaxies are also seen to reflect the density  morphology relation ( cf .",
    "table  1 , last column ) . given the wide range of luminosity function shapes among the six galaxy types considered here , any type - independent assessment of the luminosity function may be sensitive to the large - scale structure encompassed by the survey .",
    "in addition we report preliminary evidence for variation in the type - specific luminosity function of some clans as a function of local density .",
    "the effect is most prominent in the ( early - type ) clan 2 population .",
    "finally we compared the lcrs luminosity function with those of other redshift surveys .",
    "the case for a steep faint - end rise to the luminosity function , with a power - law index around @xmath129 , is now quite strong .",
    "the lower values of faint - end slope reported in the literature result primarily from poor sampling of faint galaxies , coupled with an inappropriate extrapolation of the best - fit @xmath50 parameter . in some recent work ( e.g. , zucca  @xcite , sprayberry@xcite )",
    "the excess number of faint galaxies has prompted the use of a model consisting of a schechter function with a break at some faint magnitude to a pure power law .",
    "a similar effect can be achieved by taking the luminosity function to be a linear combination of schechter functions with varying @xmath50 parameters , and on the basis of the results presented here , we argue that this latter approach is more realistic .",
    "the success of the spectral classification method used here on the lcrs galaxies suggests that it may be fruitfully applied to larger catalogs such as the upcoming sloan digital sky survey .",
    "then , with better sky coverage we may be able to examine in greater detail the luminosity function , a critical ingredient for understanding cosmic structure formation .",
