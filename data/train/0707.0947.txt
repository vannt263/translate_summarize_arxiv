    "when two fluids are in relative motion on either side of a common boundary , the kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instability can occur .",
    "this instability , the simplest example of shear flow instability , is a well - known phenomenon in fluid mechanics and astrophysics ( e.g.chandrasekhar 1961 ) .",
    "for example , the interactions between the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres are studied based on the kh instability ( e.g. nagano 1979 ) . the kh instability , because of the velocity shear in the mass flow between coronal plume structure and the interplume region of the sun , could be a potential source for some of the alfvnic fluctuations observed in the solar wind ( andries , tirry & goossens 2000 ) .",
    "the structure and the helical wave motion in the ionized cometary tails as studied by ershkovich & mendis ( 1986 ) , ershkovich , prialnik & eviatar ( 1986 ) and ershkovich , flammer & mendis ( 1986 ) using the kh theory .",
    "the kh instability theory has been successfully used to interpret the structure of the pc - scale jet in the radio source 3c273 ( lobanov & zensus 2001 ) .",
    "birk et al .",
    "( 2000 ) studied the role of kh instabilities in superwinds of primeval galaxies .",
    "the effect of radiative losses on the evolution of the kh instability in jets and outflows has been studied by many authors , either in linear regime ( e.g. , massaglia et al .",
    "1992 ; hardee & stone 1997 ) or by direct numerical simulations ( e.g. , rossi et al .",
    "1997 ; downes & ray 1998 ) .",
    "recently , michikoshi & inutsuka ( 2006 ) studied the kh instability of the dust layer in protoplanetary discs to understand the effect of relative motion between gas and dust .    however , in many astrophysical flows the single fluid approximation is inappropriate .",
    "for example , the fact that the winds and the intergalactic medium may be only partially ionized should be considered in treatment of role of the kh instability in superwinds of primeval galaxies .",
    "we may have a similar situation at the interface between a jet and its cocoon if the kh instability is to be viewed as a possible mechanism for entrainment .",
    "the problem becomes more complicated if we note that the development of the kh instability is strongly influenced by the magnetic field ( e.g.  malagoli et al .",
    "1996 ; jones et al . 1997 ) .",
    "therefore it seems a two - fluid treatment of kh instability , taking account of the different motions of ions and neutrals and of the magnetic field , rather than a pure one fluid mhd description is a more appropriate approach .    by neglecting the thermal pressure forces of the neutrals or perturbations in the neutral gas bulk velocities , the kh instability of a system consisting of ions and neutrals with applications to partially ionized cometary ionopauses , has been studied for both compressible ( ershkovich & mendis 1986 ) and incompressible cases ( ershkovich , prialnik & eviatar 1986 ; ershkovich , flammer & mendis 1986 ) .",
    "chhajlani & vyas ( 1991 ) incorporated the effects of finite resistivity and rotation on the kh instability of two superposed fluids slipping past each other .",
    "they showed that small rotation and the presence of neutral particles destabilize the system .",
    "birk et al .  ( 2000 ) studied the kh instability by taking into account the full incompressible dynamics of both the neutral and the ionized gas components with applications to multi - phase galactic outflow winds . in another similar study , watson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( hereafter wzhc ) investigated the kh instability in the linear , partially ionized regime to determine its possible effect on entrainment in massive bipolar outflows .",
    "they showed that for much of the relevant parameter space , neutral and ions are sufficiently decoupled that the neutrals are unstable while ions are held in place by the magnetic field .",
    "birk & wiechen ( 2002 ) focused on unstable shear flows in partially ionized dense dusty plasma .",
    "they considered the dust and neutral gas components so that dust and neutral collisions is the dominant momentum transfer mechanism and dust component can interact with magnetic field lines , although dust charge fluctuations are negligible .",
    "they showed long wavelength modes can be stabilized by dust and neutral gas collisional momentum transfer . by doing multifluid numerical simulations , wiechen ( 2006 ) studied kh modes in partially ionized , dusty plasmas for different masses and charges of dust .",
    "analytical studies of kh instability in weakly ionized medium have so far considered one interface between two flows .",
    "for example , whzc studied incompressible kh instability in a two - fluid system ( charged and neutral ) in order to understand entrainment in outflows from massive stars .",
    "they did the calculations in planar geometry with an interface at @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is not unreasonable to suppose that we may have a flowing layer with finite thickness and two interfaces . in this paper",
    ", we generalize the whzc analysis by considering a finite thickness for a weakly ionised flow .",
    "we will show that the growth time - scale of the instability increases due to the thickness of the layer in particular in the long wavelength limit . in the next section",
    ", we will present the basic equations and assumptions of the model . in the section 3",
    ", we will discuss growing modes and their dependence on the thickness of the layer .",
    "we follow the analysis of chandrasekhar ( 1961 ) but take account of the different bulk velocities and densities of the neutral and ions , both inside and outside the layer .",
    "these two components of our model are coupled by collisional interactions .",
    "we assume incompressibility for the analytical calculations and also that the convective term in the induction equation dominates the resistive one . for doing linear analysis ,",
    "the unperturbed properties of the system are important .",
    "we suppose that the streaming takes place in the @xmath1direction with velocity @xmath2 , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is constant ) and the neutral and ion components have the same velocity in the unperturbed state .",
    "note that @xmath5 is the thickness of the layer and @xmath6 .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed parallel to the interface ; that is , @xmath7 .",
    "finally , all unperturbed physical quantities are assumed constant in each medium .",
    "the system under consideration consists of charged and neutral fluid components coupled by collisional interactions .",
    "the basic equations are    @xmath8    @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    also note that @xmath12 . in the above equations",
    ", @xmath13 is the collision rate coefficients per unit mass so that @xmath14 is the neutral - ion frequency .",
    "the collision frequency determine the scale of the coupling between the different components and the coupling between each component and the magnetic field .",
    "now , we perturb the physical variables as @xmath15 $ ] , and so @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 components of the perturbed velocity of the neutrals . also , the equations of the ions are @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 components of the perturbed velocity of the ions",
    ". we can reduce the above differential equations to a set of two differential equations for @xmath28 and @xmath21 as follows ( wzhc ) @xmath29 @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the behavior of the flow both inside and outside the layer is determined by the general solutions of the linear differential equations ( [ eq : main1 ] ) and ( [ eq : main2 ] ) .",
    "one can easily show that the general solutions of these equations are linear combinations of @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we impose the condition that the perturbed quantities do not diverge at @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the general solutions are @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are constants which are determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "we note that , because of symmetry of the unperturbed state , there are solutions where @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( odd solutions ) and solutions where @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( even solutions ) .",
    "thus , we can write the boundary condition at @xmath0 as @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are corresponding to even and odd solutions , respectively . thus ,",
    "considering symmetry properties of the solutions ( i.e. equations ( [ eq : bound1 ] ) and ( [ eq : bound2 ] ) ) our solutions are also valid for @xmath52 , if we transform @xmath53 .",
    "so , the solutions correctly vanish , as @xmath54 .",
    "another boundary condition is the continuity of the ion and neutral displacements across the interfaces .",
    "so , the boundary conditions at @xmath55 are @xmath56 @xmath57 having equations ( [ eq : bound1 ] ) , ( [ eq : bound2 ] ) , ( [ eq : bound3 ] ) and ( [ eq : bound4 ] ) , we can rewrite @xmath58 and @xmath59 as @xmath60    @xmath61    clearly , the differential equations ( [ eq : main1 ] ) and ( [ eq : main2 ] ) are not valid at the interfaces @xmath55 ( or @xmath62 ) , where velocities of the species are not analytic",
    ". however , we can integrate each equation over an infinitesimal region around the interface @xmath55 and use standard gaussian pillbox arguments .",
    "then we have @xmath63 @xmath64 by substituting equations ( [ eq : c2 ] ) and ( [ eq : c5 ] ) into the above equations and after lengthy ( but straightforward ) mathematical manipulations , we obtain @xmath65 c_2 - m\\xi c_5 = 0,\\label{eq : c2main}\\ ] ] @xmath66 c_5 = 0,\\label{eq : c5main}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 and the ion alfvn velocity @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 . by the condition that the algebraic equations ( [ eq : c2main ] ) and ( [ eq : c5main ] ) have a nontrivial solution , we obtain the dispersion relation @xmath71\\xi^2\\ ] ] @xmath72\\xi + ( 1-\\lambda^2)[(1-\\lambda^2)h^2-a^2]h^2=0.\\label{eq : mainm}\\ ] ] this algebraic equation ( [ eq : mainm ] ) is the basis of our stability analysis . as we see",
    ", the effect of the thickness of the layer appears by term @xmath73 which depends on the thickness of the layer . for a system with one interface at @xmath0 , wzhc obtained this algebraic equation @xmath74\\xi + ( h^2-a^2)h^2=0.\\ ] ] we note that our algebraic equation ( [ eq : mainm ] ) reduces to the above equation if we set @xmath75 .",
    "@xmath76 g ( _ top _ ) and @xmath77 mg ( _ bottom _ ) . in both cases ,",
    "it is assumed @xmath78 km s@xmath79 .",
    "the dashed curves correspond to the wzhc analysis and the other curves are labeled by the thickness of layer .",
    "black circles in the bottom plot denote the wavelength at which the growing mode changes from @xmath80 to @xmath81.,width=453 ]",
    "roots of equation ( [ eq : mainm ] ) with positive real parts correspond to growing unstable modes .",
    "this equation is applicable for various weakly ionized systems .",
    "however , in this work the input parameters are chosen to be appropriate for molecular outflows .",
    "this makes for easier comparison with the analysis of wzhc . in our illustrative examples ,",
    "the relative velocity @xmath82 is 20 km s@xmath79 , and the ratio , @xmath83 , of neutral to ionized density is assumed to be around @xmath84 .",
    "the collision frequency is @xmath85 s@xmath79 ( draine et al .  1983 ) .",
    "the magnetic field strength is taken to be either @xmath86 @xmath76 g ( weak - field case ) or @xmath86 mg ( strong - field case ) . with these parameters",
    "the ratio of the alfven velocity to the relative velocity is 4400 and 4.4 in the strong and weak magnetic field cases , respectively .",
    "having these input parameters , we can solve the algebraic equation ( [ eq : mainm ] ) numerically to find the dispersion relation and the fastest growing modes .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows plots of the dispersion relation for the above input parameters . when @xmath87 , the dispersion relation tends to wzhc analysis ( dashed curves in figures [ fig:1 ] ) , as expected .",
    "each curve is also labeled by the thickness of the layer , i.e. @xmath5 .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fig:1 ] that the effect of the thickness of the layer is not significant for perturbations with short wavelength . however , as the wavelength of the perturbations increases , the thickness of the layer has a stabilizing effect on the growing modes and the dispersion relation deviates from the analysis of wzhc both in the weakly and strongly magnetised cases . considering the thickness of the layer implies longer growth time - scale for the perturbations , in particular in the long wavelength limit . moreover , as one would expect , as the thickness of the layer decreases the deviation from the wzhc analysis occurs at shorter wavelength , and also the growth time - scale becomes longer .",
    "interestingly , the roots of equation ( [ eq : mainm ] ) which correspond to growing modes can be described by approximate analytical solutions .",
    "there are three approximate positive roots for this equation depending on its coefficients :    \\(i ) @xmath80 , when @xmath88 ;    \\(ii ) @xmath81 , when @xmath89 and @xmath90 ;    \\(iii ) @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the agreement between these approximate roots and numerical roots of the equation ( [ eq : mainm ] ) is excellent .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath93 the only growing mode is the first growing mode , irrespective of the strength of the magnetic field ( see top plot of figure [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "once this inequality is violated , we may have the second growing mode , depending on whether @xmath90 .",
    "for example , for @xmath94 mg we have @xmath95 and so the transition from the first to the second growing modes occurs when @xmath96 .",
    "we can denote this transition wavelength by @xmath97 and is shown by black circles in figure [ fig:1 ] ( bottom plot ) .",
    "but in the weakly magnetic case where @xmath94 @xmath76 g , we have @xmath98 .",
    "so , for wavelengths greater than @xmath97 , the third growing mode appears , although the second term inside the parenthesis of this root is much smaller than unity and the third mode actually tends toward first mode ( top plot ) . considering our ranges of the input parameters ,",
    "the third mode is very close to the first mode .",
    "the first mode corresponds to the usual hydrodynamic instability , but the second mode appears in our weakly ionized case as a new mode ( wzhc ) .",
    "the transition between these two modes depends on the thickness of the layer .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows the transition wavelength @xmath97 versus the the half thickness of the layer . for thin layers ,",
    "the transition wavelength is smaller than the thick layers .",
    "in fact , as the thickness of the layer increases , this transition wavelength increase and tends to an asymptotic value for the very thick layers .",
    "wzhc analysis corresponds to this asymptotic regime .",
    "vs. the half thickness @xmath99 of the layer.,width=453 ]",
    "in this study we have extended the analysis of wzhc by considering a layer of ions and neutrals with finite thickness interacting with an ambient medium in the incompressible limit .",
    "however , this model can not be applied directly for systems , such as outflows or jets because of our simplifying assumptions .",
    "we can , however , gain insight into the possible effects of shear between a moving layer of ions and neutrals and the surrounding medium .    to our knowledge ,",
    "there are a few numerical simulations of kh instability of a multifluid system ( birk et al . 2000 ; birk & wiechen 2002 ; wiechen 2006 ) . while birk et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that kh modes can operate fast enough to amplify the magnetic field strengths in superwinds of primeval galaxies within the timescale of the outflow , birk & wiechen ( 2002 ) and wiechen ( 2006 ) studied kh instability in a dusty magnetized medium .",
    "it is difficult to make a direct comparison between our results and these numerical simulations because of different basic assumptions .",
    "we considered an incompressible two - fluid layer , but all these numerical simulations are for compressible systems .",
    "moreover , the effect of charged dust particles are considered in birk & wiechen ( 2002 ) and wiechen ( 2006 ) , though we have neglected charged grains in our analysis .",
    "we have shown that the growth time - scale of kh instability in a layer of ions and neutrals increases when compared to a system with one interface , this effect being more evident in the long wavelength limit .",
    "there are two dominant growing modes of kh instability in such a system , depending on the magnetic strength and the thickness of the layer . as the thickness of the layer decreases , the transition between these two unstable modes occurs at shorter wavelengths . given these results",
    ", it remains to future work to extend this analysis to compressible case and make direct comparisons with jets or outflows with finite thickness .",
