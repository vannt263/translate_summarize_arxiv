    "though consisting of primarily old stars , galactic spheroids ( bulges of sb - sa spirals as well as s0 and elliptical galaxies ) are a major source of stellar feedback in form of mass loss and type ia supernovae ( e.g. , ciotti et al . 1991 ; knapp et al . 1992 ; mannucci et al .",
    "the specific energy of this feedback predicts that it should present primarily in x - ray - emitting hot gas .",
    "indeed , such hot gas has been detected in and around spheroids , which typically contain little cool gas .",
    "however , it has been shown repeatedly that the x - ray - inferred hot gas mass and energy are far less than the empirical predictions from the feedback inputs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this missing stellar feedback has most likely escaped into large - scale galactic halos , where the gas becomes too tenuous to be detected in existing x - ray imaging observations ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the implication of this scenario is profound , because the injection of the mass and energy into the halos could strongly affect the ecosystem of the galaxies and hence their evolution @xcite .",
    "while the above qualitative picture seems clear , there are key issues that still need to be addressed to understand both the stellar feedback itself and its interplay with the environment .",
    "significant uncertainties are still present in the mass and energy input rates of stars (   2 ) .",
    "the energy input rate is inferred from observations of sne in a large sample of galaxies of diverse optical and near - ir luminosities as well as types ( e.g. , @xcite ) , assuming a certain explosion mechanical energy deposited into the interstellar space .",
    "the stellar mass loss rate is based on the modeling of the @xmath0 emission from the circumstellar medium of evolved stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these semi - empirical rates , uncertain by a factor of at least @xmath1 for individual galaxies , can in principle be directly constrained by the measured temperature and luminosity of galactic coronae .",
    "indeed , detailed simulations have been conducted for relatively isolated `` field '' spheroids and have been compared with observations @xcite , which have led to a qualitative understanding of the feedback processes and effects on x - ray measurements . in particular",
    ", the feedback model expects that the specific energy should not change substantially from one spheroid to another , which is consistent with little correlation between the measured temperatures and k - band luminosities @xmath2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "but the measured temperatures ( @xmath3 1 kev ) are substantially lower than the expected value from simulations .",
    "the measured iron abundances of coronal gas are also typically lower than expected for the ia sn - enriched gas (   2 ) .",
    "at least part of these discrepancies can be accounted for by various 3-d effects of the ia sn heating , which produces very low - density , hot , fast - moving , and enriched bubbles that hardly radiate . when the gas in these bubbles finally mixed with the material from the stellar mass loss at large radii ,",
    "the x - ray emission becomes too weak and diffuse to be effectively detected @xcite .",
    "the observed x - ray emission thus gives only a biased view of the coronae .",
    "we expect that this bias should be minimal for a corona in the icm , however .",
    "the high external thermal and ram pressures tightly confine such coronae , resulting in a low outflow speed and hence relatively local mixing of the feedback materials .",
    "furthermore , one can better characterize the icm environment from observations , important for a self - consistent modeling of a corona .",
    "therefore , coronae embedded in the icm are ideal sites to better constrain the feedback and its interplay with the environment",
    ".    there have also been significant efforts in studying stellar feedback - powered coronae embedded in the icm , mostly focusing on the ram - pressure stripping of hot gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is shown that the global morphological and integrated properties , such as gas mass and luminosity , are strongly influenced by the environment .",
    "a set of 2d simulations done by @xcite show that galactic coronae can be maintained by stellar feedback in poor clusters while be efficiently stripped in rich ones .",
    "@xcite and @xcite simulated galaxies falling into clusters and demonstrated that a galactic corona reached a cyclic `` stripping replenishment '' dynamics due to the periodic orbital motion of the host galaxy as well as the competing processes such as stripping and stellar feedback .",
    "we focus on modeling coronae in and around intermediate - mass spheroids that are embedded in the icm .",
    "such a system is relatively simple with minimum effects due to the feedback from agns and to the radiative cooling of hot gas .",
    "we expect that the hot gas is in a quasi - steady , subsonic outflow semi - confined by the thermal and ram - pressures of the icm .",
    "this state should be only sensitive to the local properties of the icm ( see   2 for more discussion ) , avoiding large uncertainties in modeling the history of the galactic feedback and the evolution of the environment , as would be needed for a field spheroid @xcite .",
    "the simulations can also be compared with an increasing number of x - ray detections of galactic coronae of such spheroids ( e.g. , @xcite ) , leading to an improved understanding of the feedback itself and its interplay with the environment . in particular",
    ", we examine the dependence of the corona properties on the specific energy of the stellar feedback and on the thermal and ram pressures of the icm and check how measurements ( e.g. , temperature , surface brightness , overall luminosity and morphology ) may be made to infer the parameters that can not directly observed ( e.g. , the icm thermal and ram pressures local to an individual galaxy ) . here",
    ", we will present 2-d simulations only , which allow for an efficient exploration of a large parameter space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we briefly describe our numerical model and setup in   2 and present results in   3",
    "; we discuss their implications in   4 ; finally in   5 , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "our model galaxy is composed of a stellar spheroid component and a dark matter halo .",
    "we use the spherical hernquist density profile @xcite to represent the stellar mass distribution :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the total stellar mass , and @xmath6 is the scale radius",
    ". this density profile results in a gravitational potential @xmath7 the above stellar mass distribution resembles the de vaucouleur s law ; the relation between the half - light radius @xmath8 and the scale radius is @xmath9 .",
    "we characterize the dark matter halo with the nfw profile @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the scale radius of the dark halo , and @xmath12 is defined as @xmath13 in which @xmath14 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "the dark halo has a mass @xmath15 within the virial radius @xmath16 , which is defined to have a density that is @xmath17 times the mean matter density of the universe @xmath18 .",
    "we adopt @xmath17 to be @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , we have the relation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the concentration factor defined as @xmath22 and is related to @xmath15 .",
    "we set @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "thus , for a given cosmology and a given @xmath15 , the mass profile of the dark halo is totally determined .",
    "the stellar mass and energy feedback in spheroids are dominated by the mass loss and ia sne of evolved stars , respectively .",
    "we neglect the energy input from the random motion of stars and hence their ejecta .",
    "the total energy released by type ia sne is @xmath24 where @xmath25 for e / s0 galaxies according to @xcite .",
    "the empirical mass input rate from the stellar mass loss is @xmath26 where @xmath27 according to @xcite .",
    "assuming that the mechanical energy of each sn is @xmath28 , the specific energy of stellar feedback is @xmath29 per particle . to account for the uncertainties in these rates and assumptions , we also sample three different lower values of the specfic energy for comparison with observations ( table 1 ) .",
    "we assume that the energy and mass inputs follow the distribution of the stellar mass .",
    "in addition , each ia sn produces @xmath30 of iron ejecta .",
    "we assume that the iron abundance of the mass loss from stars is solar .",
    "if the ejecta is fully and instantaneously mixed with the mass loss , the expected iron abundance relative to the solar value is then @xmath31 however , in observations , supersolar metallicity is quite rare . @xcite and @xcite have shown that ia sn ejecta may not be efficiently mixed with stellar mass loss on microscopic scale , resulting in a low effective metallicity of the ism . while our focus is on the environmental effect . in our simulation , we set the iron abundance of the input mass to the solar value .",
    "the gas hydrodynamics and metal abundance distribution with both the stellar feedback and radiative cooling can be described by the following equations : @xmath32 ) & = & \\rho_g \\bf g \\it   \\nonumber   \\\\ { \\partial ( \\rho_g e ) \\over \\partial t } + \\bf \\nabla \\cdot \\it [ ( \\rho_g e + p)\\bf v \\it ] & = & s_e - n_e n_i \\lambda(t , z ) + \\rho_g \\bf g \\cdot v \\it \\nonumber   \\\\ { \\partial ( \\rho_g x_{iron } ) \\over \\partial t } + \\bf \\nabla \\cdot \\it ( \\rho_g x_{iron } \\bf v \\it ) & = & s_{iron } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first equation is mass conservation law , with @xmath33 denoting the mass density of the coronal gas .",
    "the second is momentum equation .",
    "@xmath34 is gas pressure and @xmath35 is gravitational acceleration .",
    "the third one is energy equation .",
    "@xmath36 stands for the specific energy of the gas , including both thermal and kinetic components .",
    "the second term to the right is cooling rate .",
    "we adopt the cooling curve from @xcite , assuming an optically - thin thermal plasma in collisional ionization equilibrium . for calculation of the radiation in a specific band , we use the mekal model , extracted from the x - ray spectral analysis software xspec .",
    "we use the fourth equation to keep track on the iron mass fraction , which is denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "we conduct our simulations with the flash code @xcite , an eulerian astrophysical hydrodynamics code with the adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) capability .",
    "the simulated region is fixed in the galaxy - rest frame using cylindrical coordinates , with @xmath38 ranging from @xmath39 to @xmath40 and the radius from @xmath41 to @xmath40 .",
    "the axis of the cylinder is through the center of a simulated spheroid and along the direction of its motion .",
    "the upper and lower boundary conditions are fixed so that the icm flows in and out the simulation region at a constant speed .",
    "this mimics the motion of galaxies through a local cluster environment .",
    "we apply reflection boundary condition at @xmath42 and diode boundary condition , which only allows gas to flow out , to the right side of the simulation region .",
    "compared with the simulation box , which is @xmath40 by @xmath43 , the coronae are only on the order of @xmath44 to @xmath45 across .",
    "data near the outer regions will be excluded in our analysis to avoid any potential artifacts introduced by the assumed outer boundary condition of the simulations . also , the outer region will not be shown in the following images .",
    "we allow the resolution to reach @xmath46 , so that the small coronae can be well resolved .",
    "when a simulation starts , there is no interstellar gas in the galaxy .",
    "as the simulation progresses , the stellar feedback gradually accumulates in and around the spheroid to form a corona , which is characterized by its higher iron abundance . in the mean time , the ram - pressure and turbulent motion strips gas at the outer boundaries of the corona .",
    "we end the simulation when it reaches a statistically quasi - steady state . empirically , the time to reach such a state is @xmath47 gyr , while the time for the icm to pass the simulation region ranges from @xmath48 gyr to @xmath49 gyr .",
    "representative results are all extracted from the simulations after this time .",
    "the presence of a local quasi - steady state is a reasonable assumption for a compact corona .",
    "as a galaxy moves through a cluster , the icm condition can of course change drastically .",
    "but the time scale for such a change is typically much longer than the dynamic time for the corona to adapt the local environment . for a cluster of a characteristic size of @xmath50 mpc and temperature of 2 kev , for example",
    ", the crossing time for a galaxy moving roughly at the sound speed is @xmath51 gyr . in contrast , for a corona of a typical size @xmath52 kpc and temperature @xmath53 kev , the sound crossing time is only @xmath54 myr . even if a corona is totally destroyed at some point(e.g . at the central region of a cluster ) , the re - building time scale @xmath55 , as dicussed above , is still shorter than the environment change time scale .",
    "therefore , the local quasi - steady state is a reasonable assumption for characterizating the environmental impact on galactic coronae .",
    "we have simulated a set of cases to characterize the dependence on key parameters .",
    "table 1 lists our adopted model parameter values .",
    "the different combinations of the icm density ( @xmath56 , the number density of all particles ) and temperature ( @xmath57 ) as well as the mach number ( @xmath58 ) and specific energy ( @xmath59 ) of the model galaxy form a set of 48 cases .",
    "[ t : model_p ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ f : plot_compare ] compares the hydrostatic solutions ( eq .  [ e : hs ] ) to the simulations with three different @xmath60 parameters .        in those cases with small @xmath60 , such as @xmath61 , in which the gravity dominates over the feedback ,",
    "the hydrostatic solutions give nearly perfect matchs to the simulated pressure profiles . while in a case like @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 ) ,",
    "where the feedback dominates , the deviation of the hydrostatic solution from the simulated profile is apparent . for the cases which we think are plausible ( @xmath64=1.8kev , see ",
    "[ ss : discussion_02 ] ) , @xmath60 is about @xmath65 or much less than @xmath65 , and the coronae are largely in hydrostatic state .    although the same model galaxy ( in terms of the stellar and dark matter masses ) is adopted for all the simulation cases , the resultant x - ray luminosities can still differ by up to two orders of magnitude , due to the different choices of the mach number , @xmath64 , and/or thermal pressure values of the icm . because the corona temperature is determined by @xmath64 , the gas density is @xmath66 if the corona is in a nearly hydrostatic state .",
    "therefore , the surface brightness of a corona provides a measure of the ambient icm pressure and thus may be used to estimate the line - of - sight position in a cluster .    however , the x - ray luminosity of a corona depends on several factors .",
    "[ f : plot_lumin ] shows a clear anti - correlation between the luminosity and specific energy @xmath64 .",
    "this anti - correlation is primarily due to the density decrease with the increase of @xmath64 , although it does not strongly affect the size of a corona .",
    "the icm thermal pressure tends to squeeze the corona , hence enhance its luminosity ( subsonic cases ) .",
    "but this effect is complicated by the presence of the ram - pressure .",
    "as the mach number increases , the lumonosity can decrease because the ram - pressure stripping reduces the overall size ofthe corona .",
    "these dependences on the environment as well as the stellar feedback energetics may naturally explain the observed large dispersion of @xmath67 for spheroids of similar @xmath2",
    ". the complications in the dependences may also account for the lack of a clear observed trend in the icm environment effect on x - ray luminosities of coronae @xcite .      in our model of the galactic coronae",
    ", the gas temperature is primarily determined by the specific energy of the stellar feedback and thus should not change significantly with the stellar mass .",
    "this independence on the mass or @xmath2 is consistent with the temperature measurements of the coronae of intermediate - mass spheroids @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the correlation between the temperature and @xmath68 for more massive systems such as clusters and groups of galaxies @xcite .",
    "in particular , galaxy clusters show a well - defined scaling law between the temperature and luminosity of the observed hot gas , which is a natural result of the predominant gravitational heating in the self - similar cluster formation .",
    "the scaling law for lower mass systems ( e.g. , groups of galaxies ) is known to be slightly different from that for clusters ( e.g. , showing an entropy floor ) , which is believed to be an imprint of preheating(e.g . , starburst and early agns ) .",
    "correlation between @xmath68 and the temperature of hot gas is observed in massive x - ray - bright elliptical galaxies , especially for central galaxies in groups and clusters ( e.g , , @xcite ) .",
    "but the entropies are found lie below the entropy floor(@xmath69 ) discovered in groups of galaxies .",
    "radiative cooling could account for the low entropy , although how this runaway process may be balanced by the heating due to the mechanical inputs from both stellar and agn feedbacks remains unclear .",
    "we have shown that the low value and the positive radial gradient of the entropy are expected from the distributed feedback in intermediate - mass spheroids , in which the radiative cooling is not important .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the coronae of intermediate - mass spheroids represent the extreme case in which the stellar feedback plays a dominant role , which means they are produced by stellar mass loss and heated by sne .",
    "we may further constrain the stellar feedback based on the measured temperature of the coronae . though with a relative large dispersion , the measured temperatures are mostly fall in the range of @xmath70 , which is significantly higher than those measured in field spheroids , but is still substantially lower than what is inferred from our 2-d simulations if the canonical specific energy value of the stellar feedback is assumed ( @xmath71 ; see ",
    "[ s : setup ] ) .",
    "part of this discrepancy could still be due to the 3-d effects of discrete heating by ia sne , as mentioned in   1 ( and characterized in @xcite ) .",
    "but we expect that such effect should be substantially weaker in the compact coronae embedded in the high pressure icm and that the measured temperature should more faithfully reflect the specific energy of the feedback .",
    "to match the measured temperature range of the coronae requires a specfic energy of @xmath72 , or a factor of @xmath73 lower than the canonical value ( @xmath74 ;   [ s : setup ] ) .",
    "this factor is probably still within the uncertainties of the semi - emipirical mass and energy injection rates .",
    "further , the assumed mechanical energy per ia sn could be somewhat ( e.g. , a factor of @xmath1 ) less than @xmath75 . also a considerable fraction of the energy can be used to generate cosmic rays , magnetic field and turbulent motion .",
    "the diversion of the energy into these various forms could significantly reduces the temperature , although the hydrodynamics of the coronae , hence the density and pressure distributions , should not be significantly affected .",
    "the simulated coronae with @xmath76 generally have individual luminosties of a few times @xmath77 , consistent with the observed range of @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "a considerably large value of @xmath64 is not favored , because it decreases the expected luminosity steeply ( fig .  [",
    "f : plot_lumin ] ) .",
    "we discuss here the potential impacts of the pressure or density enhancement of the coronae on the fueling of the central smbhs and the evolution of cool gas , if present in the spheroids .",
    "the simulation shows that the central density of a corona is sensitive to the thermal pressure of the surrounding medium . to infer the power of a smbh",
    ", we adopt the bondi accretion rate @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the mass of the smbh , while @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the density and sound speed at the center of a corona . assuming the fraction of the accretion energy released is @xmath83 , the power of the smbh can be approximated as @xmath84 the smbh mass can be estimated from its correlation with the spheroid mass @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "[ f : plot_agnpower ] shows the dependence of the power on the icm state , the mach number of spheroid , and the specific energy of the feedback .    , green for @xmath86 and blue for @xmath87 . to avoid overlap among the symbols ,",
    "the higher mach number models are shifted to the right a litte bit and the subsonic cases to the left . ]    in particular the luminosity for the most plausible @xmath88 cases is about @xmath89 , which falls in the range of the x - ray power of a low luminosity agn .",
    "this indicates that a compact corona built up by stellar feedback and embedded in cluster environment could feed a moderate agn .",
    "the icm pressure also tends to enhance the accretion , consistent with the finding that the galaxies with @xmath90 agns are more centrally concentrated than ones without @xcite .",
    "these galaxies with agns are not dominated by galaxies that have recently entered the clusters .",
    "similar conclusions are also reached in more recent studies , such as the one by @xcite , based on the analysis of a sample of @xmath91 radio galaxies and @xmath92 point sources .",
    "the pressure enhancement could also have significant impacts on cool gas in a galaxy . under high pressure ,",
    "cool gas exists preferentially in molecular form rather than atomic one .",
    "the compression of cold gas because of the icm pressure could further lead to star formation @xcite , depriving the galaxy of the gas further . thus it is expected that galaxies contain less amounts of cool gas in clusters than in the field .",
    "these impacts should affect cool gas not only in spheroids , but in spirals as well , consistent with existing observations @xcite .",
    "we have conducted a range of 2-d hydrodynamic simualtions of galactic coronae that result from gradual energy and mass feedback in stellar spheroids moving in the icm enviornment . we have focused on spheroids that are in the intermediate - mass range ( corresponding to @xmath93 ) so that both the agn feedback and the radiative cooling of the hot gas could largely be neglected .",
    "we explore the dependence of corona properties on the specific energy of the stellar feedback as well as on the ram and thermal pressures of the icm .",
    "our major results and conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "x - ray coronae embedded in clusters could be naturally explained by the subsonic outflow driven by the stellar feedback , semi - confined by the ram - pressure and compressed by thermal pressure of the surrounding icm .",
    "the corona temperature depends primarily on the specific energy of the input material in such a way that @xmath94 .",
    "the decrease of the thermal energy due to the climbing of the gravitational potential and the expansion is largely compensated by the distributed heating by ia sne .",
    "this result naturally explains the lack of the correlation between the temperature and k - band luminosity for the spheroids in our considered mass range .",
    "an outflow powered by a distributed feedback also has a positive radial entropy profile , mimicking what may be produced by a `` cooling flow '' .",
    "the coronal gas is typically in an approximate hydrostatic state . as a result",
    ", the density of the corona gas depends strongly on the thermal pressure of the icm , but only weakly on the ram pressure .",
    "therefore , the surface brightness of x - ray emission is a good measurement of the thermal icm pressure , which may be used to estimate the line - of - sight location of a spheroid in a cluster .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of a corona decreases with the increase of the feedback specific energy .",
    "the thermal pressure tends to increase ( or reduce ) the luminosity in subsonic ( supersonic ) cases .",
    "the semi - confinement of the coronae by the icm allows a good constraint on the energetics of the stellar feedback . to be consistent with the observed x - ray luminosity and temperature ,",
    "the specific energy of the feedback should be @xmath95 , a factor of 2 - 3 smaller than the value inferred from the commonly accepted semi - empirical ia sn and mass - loss rates , assuming the mechanical energy of @xmath96 per sn .",
    "4 .   the relatively high pressure of the coronae in the icm may have important implications for understanding the agn activity as well as the cool gas properties in spheroids .",
    "the density increase caused by the icm pressure , for example , could enhance the bondi accretion , which may explain the observed central concentration of agns in clusters .",
    "the high pressure can further compress the gas to form molecular clouds and enhance star formation .",
    "the combination of the enhanced consumption and the ram - pressure striping can naturally lead to the deprivation of gas and subsequent passive evolution of galaxies in clusters .",

    "<S> recently x - ray observations have shown the common presence of compact galactic coronae around intermediate - mass spheroid galaxies embedded in the intracluster / intragroup medium ( icm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we conduct 2-d hydrodynamic simulations to study the quasi - steady - state properties of such coronae as the natural products of the ongoing distributed stellar feedback semi - confined by the thermal and ram pressures of the icm . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the temperature of a simulated corona depends primarily on the specific energy of the feedback , consistent with the lack of the correlation between the observed hot gas temperature and k - band luminosity of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated coronae typically represent subsonic outflows , chiefly because of the semi - confinement . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the hot gas density increases with the icm thermal pressure . </S>",
    "<S> the ram pressure , on the other hand , chiefly affects the size and lopsidedness of the coronae . </S>",
    "<S> the density increase could lead to the compression of cool gas clouds , if present , and hence the formation of stars . </S>",
    "<S> the increase also enhances radiative cooling of the hot gas , which may fuel central supermassive black holes , explaining the higher frequency of active galactic nuclei observed in clusters than in the field . </S>",
    "<S> the radiation enhancement is consistent with a substantially higher surface brightness of the x - ray emission detected from coronae in cluster environment . </S>",
    "<S> the total x - ray luminosity of a corona , however , depends on the relative importance of the surrounding thermal and ram pressures . </S>",
    "<S> these environment dependences should at least partly explain the large dispersion in the observed diffuse x - ray luminosities of spheroids with similar stellar properties . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that an outflow powered by the distributed feedback can naturally produce a positive radial gradient in the hot gas entropy , mimicking a cooling flow .    </S>",
