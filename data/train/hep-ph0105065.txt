    "the total cross section , @xmath7 , and the @xmath8 parameter ( ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward elastic scattering amplitude ) are important quantities in the investigation of elastic hadron - hadron scattering at high energies @xcite .",
    "they are expressed in terms of the elastic scattering amplitude , @xmath9 , by the formulas ,    @xmath10    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the center - of - mass energy and @xmath13 the four - momentum transfer squared .    for _ proton - proton ( @xmath0 ) collisions",
    "_ , both quantities have been extracted from accelerator experiments and the results extend up to @xmath14 gev . on the other hand , @xmath1 may also be inferred from cosmic - ray experiments at still higher energies , @xmath15 tev .",
    "however , these cosmic - ray results are model - dependent , since they are obtained from proton - air cross sections @xcite and this has originated different results for @xmath1 in the interval @xmath16 tev , which exhibit a reasonable degree of discrepancy .",
    "several models present extrapolations at the cosmic - ray region and the observed discrepancies may be accommodated by different models @xcite . as we shall recall , presently , it is difficult to decide which could be the `` correct '' result and it seems that the general trend is to expect the new data from the next accelerator experiments , the bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , @xmath17 gev @xcite and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , @xmath18 tev @xcite .",
    "however , at this stage , we understand that a model independent analysis of the experimental information presently available , taking detailed account of the discrepancies and its consequences , may bring important insights on the subject .",
    "this is the central point we are interested in .    in this communication , we first investigate two sets of distinct results for @xmath1 , at cosmic - ray energies , in a model independent way that also takes into account of the experimental data at the accelerator region ( @xmath19 gev ) . in each case",
    "we fit four different analytic functions to each ensemble of data , using the cern - minuit routine @xcite .",
    "next we make use of the one - subtracted derivative analyticity relation ( dar ) in order to obtain analytic parametrizations for the @xmath8 parameter as function of the energy , from both ensembles and for all the parametrizations . in this investigation",
    "we stress that the _ general _ expression of the dar has a free parameter and we present a study on the practical applicability of this parameter in the fits to the @xmath8 data . in all cases",
    "good descriptions of the experimental data are obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the experimental information on @xmath1 from accelerator and cosmic - ray experiments and recall the main steps connecting integral and derivative analyticity relations . the fits concerning @xmath1 and",
    "the results for @xmath5 are presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss in some detail all the results obtained and present comparisons with some model predictions .",
    "the conclusions and some final remarks are the content of sec . v.",
    "here we first review the experimental information presently available on @xmath1 at the highest energies , stressing the puzzles involved at the cosmic - ray region .",
    "we also recall some essential formulas connecting integral and derivative analyticity relations and the corresponding derivative relation between @xmath1 and @xmath8 ( the analytical approach ) .      as mentioned before",
    ", in order to analyze the experimental information presently available on @xmath20 for @xmath0 interaction at energies beyond @xmath21 gev ( high energy region ) , we must distinguish between accelerator and cosmic - ray information . in the later case",
    "we follow a discussion first presented in ref . @xcite .    concerning accelerators , data on @xmath1 from three experiments at the cern intersecting storage ring ( isr ) , between @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev ,",
    "were critically analyzed by amaldi and schubert and we shall consider here the final mean values from their analysis @xcite .",
    "we also include the results at @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 gev , obtained in fermilab @xcite .",
    "although other accelerator data exist in this region , this set is suitable for the analyzes we are interested in . from one hand",
    ", these data represent the correct trend of @xmath0 collisions in the region @xmath26 gev and allow a statistical approach that includes different cosmic - ray information ( see what follows ) . on the other hand , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "iv , they are adequate for comparison with a model that predicts a faster rising of @xmath1 than generally expected .",
    "differently from accelerator data , cosmic - ray experimental information on @xmath1 comes from proton - air cross sections .",
    "we recall that antiprotons are not expected to have any significant role in these interactions and therefore the bulk of cosmic ray information on hadron - nucleus cross sections does not concern antiprotons .",
    "now , since what is extracted in these experiments is the proton - air cross section , the determination of the @xmath0 cross section depends on nuclear model assumptions @xcite and this has originated some puzzles , as reviewed in what follows .",
    "the first information on @xmath1 from cosmic ray experiments , at @xmath27 tev , was reported by baltrusaitis _",
    "et al . _ in 1984 @xcite .",
    "extensive air showers recorded by fly s eye detector allowed the determination of the proton - air inelastic cross section .",
    "based on glauber theory , assuming a gaussian profile for the nucleus and the proportionality between total cross section and the slope parameter ( geometrical scaling ) , the authors inferred @xcite    @xmath28    in 1987 , based also on data from fly s eye experiment , gaisser , sukhatme and yodh ( gsy ) introduced the limit @xmath29 tev and , taking account of various process in the glauber theory and additional assumptions , estimated @xcite    @xmath30    afterwards , extensive air shower data collected in the akeno observatory allowed new estimates in the range @xmath31 tev , reported by honda _",
    "@xcite , which is in agreement with the result reported by baltrusaitis _",
    "et al . _ and in disagreement with the gsy result . in particular , extrapolations by honda _ et al .",
    "_ indicated @xcite    @xmath32    which is in agreement with the result reported by baltrusaitis et al . and in disagreement with the gsy result .",
    "in the same year , nikolaev claimed that the akeno results have been underestimated by about @xmath33 mb @xcite and , if we take this correction into account , the data in the interval @xmath31 tev show agreement with the early gsy result .",
    "an important point is the fact that the analysis by nikolaev seems correct , has never been criticized and the same is true for the gsy limit and result .",
    "all these cosmic - ray informations are shown in figure 1 , together with the accelerator data at lower energies .",
    "we stress that these experimental information concern only @xmath0 and not @xmath34 interactions . from this figure",
    "we clearly see the discrepancies between honda / baltrusaitis and gsy / nikolaev .    for these reasons ,",
    "in this paper we investigate the behavior of the total cross section taking account of the discrepancies that characterize the cosmic ray information . in order to do that",
    ", we consider _ two ensembles of data and experimental information _ , with the following notation :    ensemble a : accelerator data + honda _ et al . _",
    "+ baltrusaitis _ et al .",
    "_    ensemble b : accelerator data + nikolaev + gsy    for ensemble a the references are @xcite and for ensemble b , @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii we make use of different parametrizations to fit the data from each ensemble .",
    "both @xmath20 and @xmath5 play a central role in the investigation of high - energy hadron scattering . due to the connections between forward real and imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude , eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the analyticity ( dispersion ) relations constitute a suitable , model independent , approach for a simultaneous study of these quantities .    although integral dispersion relations have been widely used in the study of hadronic scattering , in general , the analytical and/or numerical integrations are not an easy task . however , at sufficiently high energies , the smooth increase of @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "1 ) allows to connect the integral form with a derivative one , which is easier to handle .",
    "the so called derivative analyticity relations ( dar ) were introduced in the seventies @xcite and since then have been critically investigated @xcite .",
    "recently , a recursive approach was developed , as well as generalizations to an arbitrary number of subtractions , for both cross even and odd amplitudes , near the forward direction @xcite .",
    "as in the integral case , the convergences may be controlled by subtractions and specific formulas are associated with cross even and odd functions ( scattering amplitudes in the case of particle - particle and anti particle - particle interactions ) @xcite .    at this point",
    "we stress once more that we are only interested in @xmath0 scattering ( where discrepancies happen in @xmath20 ) and not @xmath34 .",
    "besides , our investigation concerns the highest energies , characterized by the smooth increase of @xmath1 , nearly as a power on @xmath36 .",
    "for these reasons in our analyzes we will consider only an even amplitude , as the leading contribution , and only one subtraction .    a detailed deduction on how to obtain dar from integral relations may be found in references @xcite .",
    "here we only review the main steps concerning our case of interest , namely , one subtraction and an even amplitude .",
    "we begin with the well known once - subtracted integral dispersion relation ( even amplitude ) in the forward direction ( @xmath37 ) @xcite    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is the subtraction constant and @xmath40    following bronzan , kane and sukhatme @xcite , and also @xcite , we consider a real parameter @xmath41 so that after multiply and divide by @xmath42 and integrating by parts we obtain    @xmath43    taking account of the high - energy region @xmath44 gev@xmath45 ) and performing a change of variable @xmath46 the last equation may be put in the form    @xmath47    expanding @xmath48 in powers of @xmath49 , after some manipulation and taking account of the high energy limit ( @xmath50 , that is , @xmath51 ) we obtain    @xmath52    where @xmath53 represents the integral in the variable @xmath54 ,    @xmath55    we have assumed that the series may be integrated term by term . denoting @xmath56 and integrating by parts , this equation may be put in the form    @xmath57    a central point here is that the first term on the right hand side _ converges to zero only for _ @xmath58 in this case we only have the second term , which can be expressed as a recursive relation in terms of the parameter @xmath41 @xcite : @xmath59 and integration in the complex plane gives @xmath60    with this , we obtain an expression connecting the real part of an even amplitude with the derivatives of the imaginary part at the same energy , namely the dar :    @xmath61 \\frac{imf_{+}(s)}{s^{\\alpha } } .",
    "\\label{40}\\ ] ]    the leading term in the tangent series reads    @xmath62    and making use of the normalization ( @xmath63 ) ,    @xmath64    we obtain the general result for a forward amplitude :    @xmath65    at last , from equation ( 1 ) , we obtain the _ general _ relation connecting @xmath8 and @xmath7 :    @xmath66    the standard form referred to in the literature and applied to hadronic scattering corresponds to the particular choice @xmath67 ( but usually without the subtraction constant ) @xcite , which we shall refer as the _ conventional _ form of the dar : @xmath68    in the next section we use both the _ conventional _ and the _ general _ relations , in order to determine @xmath69 from different parametrizations for @xmath70 and ensembles of data .",
    "in this section we first present the fits to the total cross sections for both ensembles defined in sec .",
    "ii and then the predictions for @xmath5 obtained by means of dar .",
    "the discussion on all the obtained results is the content of sec .",
    "iv .      for each ensemble defined in sec .",
    "ii , we fit the data with some standard and suitable parametrizations for the total cross sections :    @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    @xmath74    where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are free parameters .",
    "the choice for these parametrizations was based on the following considerations .",
    "firstly , since figure 1 is a linear - log plot , we see that at the highest energies the data suggest an increase of @xmath1 as a polynomial on @xmath36 .",
    "the froissart - martin bound states that the fastest rate permissible asymptotically for the rising of @xmath1 is @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown by the ua4/2 collaboration that fits to @xmath0 and @xmath34 accelerator data indicate the power @xmath78 , a result referred to as a `` qualitative saturation of the froissart - martin bound '' @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "we consider polynomial functions on @xmath36 with two possibilities for the power factor : the value @xmath79 , according to the asymptotical bound and as a free parameter to be determined by the fits . finally , the power function on @xmath80 , eqs .",
    "( 24 ) and ( 25 ) , represents the usual way to take account of data at lower values of the energy ( @xmath81 gev ) and can be associated with regge phenomenology .",
    "the fits were performed by using the cern - minuit routine @xcite and the results for ensembles a and b are shown in figs . 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding values of the free parameters and the @xmath82 per degree of freedom are displayed in table 1 and 2 for ensembles a and b , respectively .",
    "we discuss all these results in sec .",
    "values of the parameters in equations @xmath83 and the @xmath82 per degree of freedom in each fit to ensemble a.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the parametrizations for @xmath1 are the usual ones , but the different ensembles , suggested by cosmic - ray results , introduce novel behaviors in the asymptotic region , as clearly shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "for example , by calculating the average value and the standard deviation from the four parametrizations we can estimate @xmath84 mb for ensemble a and @xmath85 mb for ensemble b. at lower values of the energy , namely @xmath12 in the region @xmath86 gev , there is no significant distinction between the four parametrizations . in general ,",
    "model predictions are in agreement with the above result from ensemble a @xcite , including the fit by the ua4/2 collaboration @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , the only exception ( model ) that presents agreement with the result from ensemble b is that of ref .",
    "this multiple diffraction model is based on analyzes of @xmath0 elastic scattering in the interval @xmath87 gev , the same set we used here at the accelerator region .",
    "extrapolation to higher energies predicted @xmath88 mb , without estimated errors .",
    "recently prez - peraza et al .",
    "improved this model predictions determining confident error bands through a forecasting regression analysis @xcite .",
    "reading from fig . 2 of this reference we can infer @xmath89 mb .",
    "despite of the large error band ( @xmath90 ) , even in this case it is clear from the quoted figure that the results favors ensemble b. from a `` statistical point of view '' we may say that the published results from models and fits show agreement with ensemble a. however , it should be stressed that the cosmic - ray estimations in the ensemble a were obtained under the hypothesis of the geometrical scaling @xcite , which is violated even at @xmath91 gev .",
    "moreover , we should remember results from cosmic - ray experiments which indicate the possibility of new phenomena in @xmath0 collisions at center - of - mass energies beyond @xmath92 gev @xcite . as a direct consequence we should expect new open channels and therefore a faster rising of the @xmath0 total cross section than expected in the extrapolations from accelerator data .",
    "this seems to be well accommodated by the parametrizations with ensemble b.    concerning the determination of @xmath5 through dar , we first showed that the _ conventional _ expression without subtraction constant ( @xmath67 and @xmath93 ) does not reproduce the experimental @xmath8 data ( fig .",
    "we recall that this expression has been referred to in the literature @xcite and also used in the context of phenomenological models @xcite . taking account of the subtraction constant @xmath94 ,",
    "the data are well described , as shown in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "from table 3 , @xmath95 depending on the fit and ensemble for @xmath1 . as expected different ensembles",
    "correspond to distinct behaviors at the highest and asymptotic energies . as in the case of",
    "@xmath1 we can estimate an average value and standard deviation from the four results in figs . 5 and 6 : @xmath96 with @xmath1 from ensemble a and @xmath97 from ensemble b. in this case",
    "we can say that the results with ensemble a present the best agreement with the experimental data ( table 3 and figs . 5 and 6 ) .",
    "we also tested the _",
    "expression for the dar by taking @xmath93 and letting @xmath41 as a free fit parameter .",
    "the results presented in figs . 7 and 8",
    "show that the data are also satisfactorily described , specially in the case of @xmath1 from ensemble b ( compare with fig .",
    "4 , the case of fixed @xmath67 ) . from table 4 ,    @xmath98    depending also on the fit and ensemble for @xmath1 . in all these cases",
    "the condition ( 13 ) is verified .",
    "in this communication we investigated two ensembles of experimental information on @xmath0 total cross sections and used four different parametrizations to fit the data , as function of the energy . in each case",
    "we obtained predictions for @xmath69 making use of both the _ conventional _ and the _ general _ expressions for the derivative analyticity relations .",
    "our first main conclusion is that experimental information presently available on @xmath0 total cross sections indicates two possible different scenarios for the hadronic interactions at the highest energies .",
    "the fast rise of @xmath1 from the analysis of ensemble b is corroborated by the multiple diffraction model of ref .",
    "@xcite and also indication of new phenomena from emulsion chamber experiments @xcite .",
    "although in this work we only point out for this possibility , new information coming from rhic and lhc shall certaintly clarify this subject . in this sense",
    ", our results may be viewed as a kind of warning against some possible precipitated assumptions , namely , that extrapolations from accelerator data which show agreement with the cosmic - ray estimations in ensemble a could be the final answer to the question .",
    "a second novel result from this model independent analysis was to show the practical applicability of both the _ conventional _ and the _ general _ expressions for the derivative analyticity relations at sufficiently high energies .",
    "in the _ conventional _ case , @xmath67 , letting the constant @xmath94 as free parameter , the description of the experimental @xmath8 data is quite good . on the other hand , taking @xmath93 and letting @xmath41 as free fit parameter , the results may be considered satisfactory . in both cases the predictions at the highest energies",
    "are practically the same ( compare figs .",
    "5 and 7 and also figs . 6 and and 8) and",
    "the differences at this energy region come obviously from the different ensembles for @xmath1 .",
    "our approach was to consider the two possibilities separately ( @xmath99 or @xmath100 ) , so that we could infer the intervals of possible variations , eqs .",
    "( 27 ) and ( 28 ) .",
    "simultaneous analysis with both possibilities shall improve the description of @xmath5 and this is our second main conclusion .",
    "in this communication we treated only @xmath0 interactions , since the cosmic - ray informations concern only this case .",
