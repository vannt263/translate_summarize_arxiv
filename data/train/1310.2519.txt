    "quantum computation demands the readout of the state of a quantum bit ( qubit ) with high fidelity . in principle , this can be realized exclusively using all - electric components by spin singlet - triplet qubits,@xcite manipulated by gate voltages and read out by spin - to - charge conversion .",
    "this technique utilizes a capacitive coupling of the qubit to a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc ) @xcite or a sensor quantum dot ( sqd).@xcite the latter is advantageous due to its higher sensitivity , resulting in larger signal - to - noise ratio.@xcite charge sensing by radio - frequency single electron transistors ( rf - sets ) , first introduced in @xcite as a static electrometer , moreover allows real - time observation  of electron tunneling events,@xcite which can be applied to  measure ultra - small currents,@xcite to test fluctuation relations in electronic systems@xcite or as which - path detectors in an aharonov - bohm ring.@xcite however , in all these setups the measured system suffers from dephasing by the environment , which leads to a cumulative error that is eventually beyond the reach of quantum error - correction schemes . yet ,",
    "such _ dissipative _ environmental backaction effects can also be controlled , as for example demonstrated by the destruction of aharonov - bohm oscillations.@xcite this may even offer new prospects for qubit control , e.g. , by mediating effective interactions between qubits that can be implemented to engender entanglement.@xcite in addition , quantum memories may be realized by engineering quantum states through dissipation @xcite .",
    "similar dissipative environmental effects are also well - known from nonequilibrium transport through quantum dots ( qds ) . however ,",
    "when a qd is embedded into a spintronic device with ferromagnetic electrodes , dissipative effects are not the only way in which it is influenced by the environment , even in leading order in the coupling : spin - dependent scattering and coulomb interaction lead to the generation of a spin torque .",
    "this torque derives from _ coherent _ processes that renormalize the qd energy levels @xcite , resulting in an  effective magnetic field , known as the _ spintronic _ exchange field.@xcite the dynamical consequence of the torque is a precession of the average spin vector on the qd,@xcite in addition to the shrinking of the spin magnitude , which is a pure dissipative effect .",
    "renormalization effects have not only been discussed for spintronic devices , but also for stm setups @xcite and superconducting nanostructures.@xcite in the latter case effective magnetic fields act on an _ isospin _ that describes proximity - induced coherences between different charge states on the qd.@xcite moreover , environmentally - induced torques are not only limited to fermionic systems ; they have also been discussed for optical activity.@xcite in the context of quantum dot readout , they have been considered for qpcs.@xcite    it is therefore natural to ask whether similar coherent effects arise when a qubit is measured by a sqd since any type of readout requires _ interaction _ of the system with its detector , which may lead to renormalization effects .",
    "this is the main focus of this paper : we derive and discuss kinetic equations for the reduced density matrix of the composite system of sqd and qubit by integrating out the lead degrees of freedom and employing a markov approximation .",
    "related previous works have studied , e.g. , decoherence effects for electrostatic qubits @xcite , or , josephson junction qubits @xcite focusing on time - dependent phenomena . in our study , we address the _ continuous _ measurement limit ,  in which the qubit level splitting @xmath0 and the sqd - qubit coupling @xmath1 are small compared to the single - electron tunneling ( set ) rates @xmath2 through the sqd : @xmath3 . in this limit , each electron `` sees '' a snapshot of the qubit state as the qubit evolution is negligible during the interaction time with an electron on the detector .",
    "our results are not only limited to weak measurements ( @xmath4 ) but are also valid for @xmath5 .",
    "we extend previous works in the following four aspects :    \\(i ) we include _ level renormalization _ effects of the qubit _ plus _ the detector in the kinetic equations affecting the energy - nondiagonal part of their density matrix .",
    "these effects correspond physically to _",
    "isospin torque _ terms that couple the sqd and qubit dynamics .",
    "these torques arise due to the readout processes and can not be avoided : they incorporate a term that scales in the same way as the readout terms @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is temperature . moreover , the renormalization of the qubit splitting @xmath0 leads to additional induced torque terms @xmath8 , expressing the fact that the charge fluctuations @xmath9 are sensitive to all internal energy scales ( @xmath10 ) of the sqd - qubit system .",
    "\\(ii ) our kinetic equations also necessarily comprise _ next - to - leading order _ corrections to the tunneling @xmath11 affecting also the diagonal part of the density matrix .",
    "generally , these are expected to be important since maximal sensitivity of the sqd to the qubit state is achieved by tuning to the flank of the set peak . in this regime of crossover",
    "to coulomb blockade , cotunneling broadening and level renormalization effects may compete with set processes @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , in actual readout experiments on singlet - triplet qubits @xcite @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , the inclusion of this renormalization of the sqd tunnel rates is even a mandatory step since the weaker isospin torque effects @xmath13 must be included to consistently describe detection at all .",
    "the importance of such an interplay between energy - diagonal and nondiagonal density matrix parts and higher - order tunnel processes was noted earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite . as in that study",
    ", we find that the failure to account for this leads to severe problems with the positivity of the density operator in the markovian approximation .",
    "in standard born - markov approaches@xcite used to study decoherence effects,@xcite positivity is usually enforced by a secular approximation.@xcite as explained in more detail in app .",
    "[ sec : secular ] , a secular approximation is not applicable in our case because the tunneling rate is not assumed to be small ( @xmath14 ) . despite this",
    ", the positivity of the density matrix is ensured when consistently including corrections @xmath11 , as shown in app .",
    "[ sec : sumrule ] .",
    "\\(iii ) in extension to @xcite , we include the electron spin degree of the sqd into our study .",
    "this has several consequences , most notably , for the qubit - dependent part of the current through the sqd : this current does _ not _ directly measure the qubit isospin , but charge - projected contributions that are weighted differently due to the sqd electron spin .",
    "\\(iv ) finally , our results cover a broad experimentally relevant regime of finite voltages and temperatures , and not only limits of , e.g. , infinite bias voltage @xmath15 in @xcite or zero temperature @xmath7 as in @xcite .",
    "the interplay of the above renormalization effects leads to nontrivial voltage dependencies , similar to that in quantum dot spin - valves .    on the technical side",
    ", we provide an important _ sum rule _ for the qubit dynamics : the kinetic equations must reproduce the free qubit evolution ( i.e. , for zero tunnel coupling ) when tracing over the _ interacting _ sqd degrees of freedom in addition to the electrodes .",
    "this is a concrete application of the generalized current conservation law discussed in @xcite .",
    "we show that our kinetic equations are consistent with this current conservation .",
    "it may be violated if instead a born - markov approach followed by a secular approximation is applied@xcite as we demonstrate for our concrete model in app .",
    "[ sec : secular ] .",
    "more generally , such a sum rule has to hold for any observable that is conserved by the tunneling .",
    "we furthermore prove in app .",
    "[ sec : sumrule ] that any kinetic equation derived from real - time diagrammatics respects this sum rule order - by - order in sqd tunnel coupling @xmath2 .    compared with previous works , however , our study is limited : we focus on the analysis of the kinetic equations in the stationary limit .",
    "although for quantum information processing ultimately the measurement dynamics is of interest , we  apply our general kinetic equations only to test measurements designed to verify that the sqd couples to a nearby qubit at all .",
    "we compare the ensemble - averaged current and differential conductance through the sqd as the readout strength is varied .",
    "our study clearly indicates that already here the isospin torque terms have a significant impact .",
    "this indicates that these terms will also influence the transient behavior of the qubit in the measurement process .",
    "the kinetic equations that we derive , however , provide a starting point for a more general analysis of coherent backaction effects , which is , however , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "this is of interest both for understanding the limitations of qubit readout devices as well as for exploring new means of controlling qubits by coherent backaction effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after formulating the model in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we introduce in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] the charge - projected qubit isospins and analyze their dynamics in dependence on the sqd charge , in particular the isospin - torque contributions to the kinetic equations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : signal ] we illustrate the quantitative importance of the isospin torques for the readout current through the sensor - qd and study the corrections it gives to the stationary read - out current and differential conductance , which is often measured directly .",
    "we find that torque terms may significantly alter the qubit - dependent  conductance , up to 30% for typical experimental values for the asymmetry of the sqd tunnel couplings .",
    "we summarize and discuss possible extensions in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .     ]",
    "the readout of spin qubits is usually reduced to a charge readout by spin - to - charge conversion @xcite .",
    "therefore , we focus here on the conceptually clearest problem , sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : model ] , namely the capacitive readout of a charge - qubit .",
    "the qubit itself consists of a double quantum dot occupied by a single electron , which occupies either an orbital localized on the left or right dot ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "these states are denoted by @xmath17 with @xmath18 , @xmath19 denoting the electron field operators of the qubit .",
    "the qubit is described by a hamiltonian accounting for a real hopping amplitude @xmath0 between the orbitals : @xmath20 the isolated eigenstates of the qubit are thus superposition states @xmath21 , corresponding to an isospin in the @xmath22 direction when @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote isospin - up and -down along the @xmath25 direction , respectively . since we assume that the real spin of the qubit electron does not couple to the measurement device , it remains fixed and we have omitted this quantum number from the beginning .",
    "the sensor quantum dot ( sqd ) is modeled by a single , interacting , spin - degenerate orbital level with hamiltonian @xmath26 containing the occupation operator @xmath27 for electrons of spin @xmath28 , whose annihilation and creation operators are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . due to the strong coulomb repulsion of the quantum - confined electrons , the double occupation of the sqd costs an additional energy @xmath31 . typically , @xmath31 is the largest energy scale ( except for the bandwidth of the leads , denoted by @xmath32 ) : charging energies are on the order of @xmath33 mev @xcite .",
    "close to the set resonance used for detection [ cf .",
    "[ sec : readout ] ] this allows us to exclude the doubly occupied state of the sqd , retaining only @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this , however , implies that we need to keep track of the spin degree of freedom of the electrons ( neglected in @xcite ) unless a high magnetic field is applied .",
    "however , for singlet - triplet qubits the applied magnetic fields ( required to define the qubit ) are in the range of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding energy splittings in gaas are a few @xmath37 , which is much smaller than typical voltage bias @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "therefore , both spin channels are energetically accessible and in general are relevant for the detection current through the sqd with noticeable consequences , as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : readout ] .",
    "furthermore , these magnetic energies are of the same order as typical tunneling rates @xmath2 .",
    "this implies that renormalization effects may be important since states of the sqd plus qubit system can be mixed by the tunnel coupling to the electrodes . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we assume zero magnetic field here , resulting in energy - degenerate spin - up and spin - down states on the sqd .",
    "the readout of the qubit state using the sqd involves two couplings : the first one is the capacitive interaction of the total charge @xmath39 on the sensor qd with the charge configuration of the qubit , given by @xmath40 this qubit - dependent energy shift by @xmath41 in turn affects the charge current through the sqd from the source to the drain electrodes , which are described as noninteracting reservoirs , @xmath42 each in equilibrium at common temperature @xmath7 , but held at different electrochemical potentials @xmath43 and @xmath44 . here",
    ", @xmath45 are the field operators referring to orbital @xmath46 and spin @xmath47 in source ( @xmath48 ) and drain ( @xmath49 ) , respectively .",
    "the second coupling involved in the readout process is the tunneling from the sqd to the electrodes , and vice versa , accounted for by @xmath50 the relevant energy scale is given , in terms of the tunneling amplitudes @xmath51 and the density of states @xmath52 of lead @xmath53 , by the tunneling rates @xmath54 . for the sake of simplicity , we take both @xmath51 and @xmath52 to be spin @xmath55 and energy @xmath56-independent . the source - drain coupling asymmetry @xmath57 of the sqd , however , is a crucial parameter .    for our analysis , we will assume the conceptually simplest continuous measurement limit @xmath3 and perform a controlled perturbative calculation .",
    "in the experimental situation @xcite in which the coupling @xmath58 the effects may be even stronger .",
    "in the following we express the _ action _ of the qubit state on the sqd and the corresponding _ backaction _ in terms of the isospin operator @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the pauli matrix for @xmath61 .",
    "the ensemble average of the isospin @xmath62 is obtained by averaging over the state of ( integrating out ) _ both _ electrodes _ and _ sqd .",
    "this qubit bloch vector characterizes the reduced density operator of the qubit and is conveniently normalized to 1 .",
    "its @xmath25 component @xmath63 quantifies the imbalance of the probability to find the qubit electron in left orbital rather than the right orbital , while @xmath64 and @xmath65 quantify coherences between the left and right occupation .",
    "it is , however , difficult to directly obtain a kinetic equation for the isospin @xmath66 while incorporating the various effects of the measurement .",
    "a general reason for this is that the sqd is also a microscopic system , so that the action of the qubit on the sensor dynamics is not negligible , which then in turn affects the backaction of the sensor on the qubit .",
    "another complication arises since we take into account an _ interacting _ detector ( with proper spinful electrons ) , which technically can not be integrated out easily .",
    "moreover , the sqd is driven out of equilibrium by the connected electron reservoirs .",
    "we therefore instead derive a kinetic equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath67 of sqd _ plus _ qubit by integrating out only the electrodes . yet",
    ", this requires _ two _ bloch vectors for a complete description of the qubit , as we now explain .",
    "the hilbert space of the joint qubit - sqd system is spanned by six states denoted by @xmath68 with @xmath69 referring to the state of the qubit and @xmath70 denoting the state of the sqd .",
    "thus , the reduced density operator @xmath67 corresponds to a @xmath71 matrix .",
    "however , since the charge , the @xmath25 component of the ( real ) spin and the total spin are conserved for the total system including the leads @xcite , the reduced density operator is diagonal in the sqd degrees of freedom and independent of the choice of quantization axis of the real spin .",
    "thus , we only need two @xmath72-density matrices @xmath73 , one for each of the two charge states of the sqd @xmath74 , @xmath75 here @xmath76 denotes the operator projecting onto the charge state @xmath77 of the sqd , that is , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the qubit unit operator . next , expanding each @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoexpand ] ) in terms of the unit and three pauli matrices we find that the relevant part of the density operator is parametrized by only 8 real expectation values @xmath80 and @xmath81 : @xmath82 the numbers @xmath83 give the probability for the sqd to be in charge state @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "probability conservation is expressed by @xmath86 furthermore , @xmath87 are the averages of the isospin components @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath25 when the sqd is in charge state @xmath84 or @xmath85 , respectively . by definition these _",
    "charge - projected _ isospins sum up to the average of the total isospin , @xmath90      the hamiltonian of the isolated reduced system ( qubit plus sqd with @xmath91 ) can be expressed in terms of the isospin operator as @xmath92 where the effective magnetic fields of the qubit mixing , @xmath93 , and the readout , @xmath94 , are orthogonal . here",
    "we see the _ action _ of the measurement : the state of the qubit modulates the effective level position of the sqd between @xmath95 .",
    "this affects the energy - dependent tunneling rates between the sqd and the leads and by this the measurable transport current .",
    "the kinetic equations for the isolated reduced system , obtained from the von - neumann equation @xmath96 $ ] , show that the charge - projected isospins are subject to different , noncollinear effective magnetic fields @xmath97 and @xmath98 : @xmath99 if the sqd is singly occupied , the capacitive interaction @xmath100 thus exerts a _ backaction _ torque , perturbing the free qubit isospin precession about @xmath97 .",
    "we note that the ensuing analysis is , in general , not limited to charge qubits : for example , in singlet - triplet qubits two exchange - coupled electrons in the qubit double quantum dot form spin - singlet and spin - triplet states , which due to a different charge distribution also couple capacitively to a sensor quantum dot ( spin - to - charge conversion )",
    ". however , the two - electron double quantum dot hilbert space is _",
    "four_-dimensional instead of two - dimensional as for the charge qubit , which introduces an additional complexity to the problem that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "still , as long as two electrons stay in the qubit subspace formed by the spin - singlet and the spin - triplet state @xmath101 , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hred ] ) provides a valid model for the readout of a singlet - triplet qubit if one included a @xmath25 component into @xmath102 , accounting for the exchange splitting @xmath103 between @xmath104 an @xmath101 ( the other two triplet states @xmath105 and @xmath106 are usually energetically split off by a large real magnetic field @xmath107 ) .",
    "note that the exchange interaction @xmath103 between the electrons is typically in the order of a few @xmath108ev,@xcite which can be well below the tunneling rate @xmath2 .",
    "this is a crucial requirement for our analysis .    when including the tunnel coupling @xmath109 of the sqd to the electronic reservoirs , eqs .",

    "we assume that the effective liouvillian can be diagonalized : @xmath353 where @xmath354 denotes the operator that the effective liouvillian is applied to .",
    "since we consider the zero - frequency effective liouvillian , all eigenvalues @xmath355 are either purely imaginary or they appear in pairs @xmath356 .",
    "the corresponding right and left eigenoperators @xmath357 and @xmath358 , respectively , are then hermitian in the first case or they come in hermitian conjugate pairs in the second case .",
    "this property ensures that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gmemarkov ] ) stays hermitian while the probability conservation follows from the fact that the operators @xmath359 are either traceless or correspond to eigenvalue with @xmath360.@xcite the right eigenvector of the zero eigenvalue , assumed to be unique and labeled by @xmath361 , is associated with the stationary state , i.e. , @xmath362 with @xmath363 and @xmath364 ( this follows from probability conservation ) .",
    "the formal solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gmemarkov ] ) thus reads @xmath365 hermiticity and probability conservation guarantee that the eigenvalues of operator ( [ eq : sol ] ) are real and sum up to 1 .",
    "however , this does not exclude negative eigenvalues , in which case the positivity of @xmath67 is violated .",
    "this will happen if at least one exponentially increasing mode with @xmath366 contributes to ( [ eq : sol ] ) , because @xmath67 is unbounded in that case for @xmath367 .",

    "we attribute these to a neglect of corrections of even higher orders in @xmath375 and @xmath0.[fig : eigenvalues ] ]",
    "the renormalized sqd rates , eq .  ( [ eq : dissrate ] ) , may be rewritten as @xmath376 in the first term we used @xmath377 and therefore @xmath378 , whereas in the second term @xmath379 .",
    "clearly , the first correction term corresponds to the change in the tunneling rates be virtual fluctuations that effectively shift the level position to @xmath380 .",
    "the dependence of the second term on the level position is typical of elastic cotunneling .",
    "even when @xmath381 is exponentially small for @xmath382 , the term @xmath383 only decays algebraically .",

    "a common procedure to avoid positivity problems arising when deriving generalized master equations , e.g. , from a born - markov approximation,@xcite is to perform a secular approximation .",
    "here one decouples the occupations and secular coherences of the eigenstates ( i.e. , states with the same energy ) of the reduced system from their nonsecular coherences ( i.e. , states with different energies ) . following the procedure described in @xcite and transforming back to the schrdinger picture , we obtain the following generalized master equations : @xmath410 the above equations are different from our result ( [ eq : kineq ] ) in three different respects : first , due to the born approximation",
    ", they involve only the leading - order tunneling rates @xmath411 .",
    "second , when the charge state of the sqd is changed , the isospins are projected by @xmath412 onto the directions of charge - dependent effective magnetic fields @xmath413 and @xmath414 .",
    "thus , the occupations only couple to @xmath151 because @xmath415 and @xmath416 are orthogonal and only @xmath417 and @xmath164 have a finite scalar product .",
    "this is a consequence of the secular approximation , which also suppresses the tunneling - induced torque - terms that couple different charge states in our equations ( [ eq : kineq ] ) ( although they have a strong impact , cf .",
    "the last two paragraphs in sec .  [ sec : readout ] ) .",
    "third , since the markov approximation in @xcite is carried out in the interaction picture , the effective magnetic fields acting on the isospin within each charge state are also different .",
    "the stationary solution of the above kinetic equations ( [ eq : p0sec])-([eq : t1sec ] ) is identical to that obtained when we neglect cotunneling corrections and the tunneling - induced torque terms in our kinetic equations ( [ eq : kineq ] ) . to understand this ,",

    "it has in fact been shown by davies @xcite that the born - markov plus a secular approximation become exact when approaching the limit of zero coupling ( here the tunneling rate @xmath2 ) between `` system '' ( qubit plus sqd ) and `` environment '' ( the leads ) for large times @xmath421 . where @xmath422 is finite and the coupling @xmath423 , cf .",
