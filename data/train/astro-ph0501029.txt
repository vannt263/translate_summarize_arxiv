    "in a universe that obeys the cosmological principle , the clustering of galaxies is statistically isotropic .",
    "but in galaxy redshift surveys the distances to galaxies are inferred from redshifts , making the line of sight a preferred direction .",
    "peculiar velocities produce anisotropy in redshift - space clustering on all scales . on small scales , the random motions of galaxies in virialized systems stretch groups and clusters into so - called `` fingers - of - god '' ( fog ) . on large scales , coherent flows created by gravity compress overdense regions along the line of sight and stretch underdense regions correspondingly .",
    "small and large scale distortions provide diagnostics for the matter density parameter @xmath0 and the amplitude of mass fluctuations ( peebles 1976 ; sargent & turner 1977 ; kaiser 1987 ) . in this paper and its companion ,",
    "we develop techniques for modeling redshift - space distortions that draw on recent developments in the theory of galaxy clustering .",
    "these techniques are designed to reach the level of accuracy demanded by the new generation of large galaxy redshift surveys , such as the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .    in the linear theory model of kaiser ( 1987 ) , the relation of the anisotropic , redshift - space galaxy power spectrum @xmath10 to the isotropic , real - space galaxy power spectrum @xmath11 is    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the cosine of the angle between the wavevector @xmath14 , and the line of sight .",
    "the amplitude of the distortion is determined by @xmath15 , where the linear bias parameter @xmath16 is assumed to be independent of scale ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent galaxy and mass density contrasts , respectively ) .",
    "fourier transformation of equation ( [ e.kaiser ] ) gives expressions for the galaxy correlation function in redshift space ,  ( hamilton 1992 ) .",
    "unfortunately , non - linear effects make equation ( [ e.kaiser ] ) inaccurate on all scales where observations yield precise measurements ( cole , fisher , & weinberg 1994 ) .",
    "the effects of non - linearity can be approximated by a phenomenological model in which galaxies have , in addition to linear theory distortions , random small scale velocities drawn from an exponential distribution with dispersion @xmath19 ( @xcite ; park  1994 ; cole  1995 ) . in this model ,",
    "the kaiser formula becomes    @xmath20    in practice , most estimates of @xmath5 from large - scale redshift - space distortions have utilized this linear - exponential model , expressed in terms of the power spectrum as in equation ( [ e.lin_exp ] ) or in terms of the correlation function or spherical harmonics .",
    "the current state - of - the - art measurement is the analysis of the 2dfgrs presented by hawkins  ( 2003 ) , yielding @xmath21 , updating the earlier 2dfgrs analysis of peacock  ( 2001 ) .",
    "previous observational efforts and theoretical developments are expertly reviewed by strauss & willick ( 1995 ) and hamilton ( 1998 ) .",
    "the essential limitation of equation ( [ e.lin_exp ] ) is that it is derived from an unphysical model .",
    "there are several sources of non - linearity in redshift - space distortions in addition to small scale dispersion ( cole  1994 ; fisher & nusser 1996 ) , and the dispersion itself is correlated with the local density and is not a constant for all galaxies .",
    "scoccimarro ( 2004 ) shows that the velocity distribution corresponding to the linear - exponential model is itself unphysical , containing a @xmath22-function and a discontinuity at the origin , and that equation ( 2 ) does not become fully accurate even at very large scales .",
    "hatton & cole ( 1999 ) concluded that this model introduces a @xmath23 systematic error in the determination of @xmath5 , which is significant compared to the precision achievable with 2dfgrs and the sdss .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath19 parameter , while related to the amplitude of the small scale distortions , has no clearly defined physical meaning . in redshift - space distortion",
    "analyses it is purely a nuisance parameter , significantly degenerate with @xmath5 , and has no use in constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "the program initiated by kaiser ( 1987 ) largely supplanted an earlier tradition of using small - scale redshift distortions to constrain @xmath0 via the `` cosmic virial theorem '' ( peebles 1976 , 1979 ; davis , geller , & huchra 1978 ; bean  1983 ) .",
    "the analytic expression of this `` theorem '' relied on the assumption of stable clustering , which early n - body simulations showed was unlikely to hold on the relevant scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a more serious problem is that the bias between galaxy and dark matter clustering is likely to have a complex effect on quantities that enter the cosmic virial theorem , one that can not be captured by a single bias parameter with an obvious physical interpretation .",
    "the goal of this paper and its companion is to present techniques for physical modeling of redshift - space distortions that can take advantage of high - precision measurements on large and small scales .",
    "we construct these techniques in the framework of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ; see , e.g. ma & fry 2000 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; seljak 2000 ; benson 2001 ; scoccimarro  2001 ; berlind & weinberg 2002 ; cooray & sheth 2002 ) , in which the bias of a specified class of galaxies is defined by the probability distribution @xmath24 that a halo of mass @xmath25 contains @xmath26 galaxies , together with prescriptions for spatial and velocity bias within individual halos .",
    "the hod has proven to be a powerful tool for encapsulating the bias predictions of galaxy formation models ( kauffmann  1997 ; benson  2000 ; white  2001 ; yoshikawa  2002 ; berlind  2003 ; kravtsov  2004 ; zheng  2004 ) , for analytic calculations of galaxy clustering statistics ( see cooray & sheth 2002 and numerous references within ) , and for empirical modeling of galaxy clustering data ( jing  1998 ; van den bosch  2003 ; zehavi 2004a , b ; yang  2004 ; mo  2004 ; @xcite ) .",
    "several recent papers have presented calculations of redshift - space distortions or peculiar velocity statistics using halo models of dark matter and galaxy clustering ( seljak 2001 ; white 2001 ; @xcite ; kang  2002 ; cooray 2004 ) , providing insight into the role of non - linear dynamics and non - linear bias in shaping clustering and anisotropy",
    ". however , these studies primarily focus on dark matter rather than galaxy clustering , and they have not yet yielded a clear blueprint for constraining cosmological parameters with hod modeling of observed redshift - space distortions , which is our objective here .",
    "we use the hod formulation to set up the redshift - space distortion problem in the following terms .",
    "any redshift survey large enough to yield useful measurements of large - scale anisotropy will first allow precise measurements of the projected correlation function , , which is unaffected by peculiar velocities .",
    "for any choice of cosmological parameters , one should choose hod parameters to reproduce this measurement of real - space clustering .",
    "if an acceptable fit can not be found for the given cosmology , then the model is already ruled out ( e.g. abazajian  2004 ) . for models with acceptable real - space clustering ,",
    "one calculates redshift - space distortions using numerical simulations or analytic approximations to test the model s cosmological parameters . in practice ,",
    "the parameters that enter are @xmath0 and the amplitude of the linear theory matter power spectrum @xmath27 , which we characterize by @xmath1 , the rms linear matter fluctuation in 8  spheres ( with @xmath28 ) .",
    "we assume that the _ shape _ of @xmath27 is known from measurements of the large scale galaxy power spectrum and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy , which together pin down the parameters that determine @xmath27 quite accurately ( e.g. , @xcite ) . since redshift - space anisotropy is insensitive to the shape of @xmath11",
    " in equations ( [ e.kaiser ] ) and ( [ e.lin_exp ] ) the @xmath13-dependence of @xmath29 factors out entirely  small uncertainties in the shape of @xmath27 should have minimal effect . in this work",
    "we adopt the power spectrum form of efstathiou , bond , & white ( 1992 ) , where the shape is parameterized by the characteristic wavenumber @xmath30 .",
    "while matching  can constrain hod parameters relevant to real - space clustering , we must also allow for the possibility that galaxies in a halo have a systematically different velocity dispersion from that of the halo dark matter .",
    "( the mean velocity of galaxies and dark matter within a halo should be the same because both components feel the same large - scale gravitational field . )",
    "numerical simulations predict that the galaxy closest to the halo center of mass moves at nearly the center of mass velocity while satellite galaxies have a velocity dispersion similar to that of the dark matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "we define the satellite `` velocity bias '' , @xmath31 , as the ratio between these two dispersions .",
    "although the numerical simulations predict that @xmath32 , this parameter could depart modestly from unity as a result of dynamical friction , tidal disruption or mergers of slowly moving satellites , or different orbital anisotropy of galaxies and dark matter .",
    "we will treat @xmath31 as a free parameter to be constrained by the observations , but we will assume that it is constant over the relevant range of halo masses .",
    "we will also consider effects of non - zero velocities for central galaxies , though simulations predict these velocities to be @xmath33 of the virial velocity .",
    "in this paper we use n - body simulations to create halo populations for a set of cosmological models , and we populate those halos with galaxies using hod models that yield similar real - space clustering . we examine the constraints that redshift - space distortions can impose within the three - dimensional parameter space ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath31 ) , and we use our numerical results to obtain fitting formulas that can estimate parameters from observational data . in a companion paper , we develop a numerically calibrated analytic model for redshift - space distortions .",
    "the analytic model provides physical insight into the numerical results , and it can make more complete use of the observational measurements for cosmological parameter estimation .    in section 2 below , we describe the numerical simulations and the hod models used to populate them with galaxies .",
    "section 3 presents an overview of redshift - space anisotropies in the two - dimensional correlation function . in ",
    "4 we focus on measures of large - scale distortion based on multipole decomposition of the power spectrum and the correlation function .",
    "these measures mainly constrain the parameter combination @xmath34 , which can be related to @xmath35 using the measured ( real - space ) galaxy clustering .",
    "( as discussed in  4.4 , we define @xmath4 by a ratio of non - linear correlation functions , which makes it similar but not identical to the linear theory bias factor @xmath36 . ) in  5 we turn to small scale distortions , which most directly constrain @xmath37 and have some power to break degeneracies further and yield separate determinations of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath31 . in  6 we summarize our results and discuss how they can be applied to cosmological parameter estimation from observational data .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the fixed  sequence , we calculate the statistical uncertainty in our estimate of the fractional error @xmath38 by separately fitting the five simulations in turn , then dividing the dispersion of the @xmath39 values by @xmath40 to obtain the uncertainty in the mean .",
    "these uncertainties are shown by error bars on the squares in figure [ beta_errors ] . in many but not all cases ,",
    "our measurement of the bias in @xmath39 for a given model is consistent with zero , or only marginally inconsistent with it .",
    "however , even when the offsets from zero are within the error bars , the trend with model parameters along a sequence may be significant , since all of our models are based on the same set of simulations .",
    "the total volume of our simulations is @xmath41@xmath42 , equivalent to that of redshift survey covering 8000 square degrees to a limiting depth of 460 .",
    "since the three orthogonal projections sample different random orientations of the large scale structures in each simulation , the effective volume is somewhat larger , though the increase is not a full factor of three because real - space structures are the same in each projection .",
    "the error bars in figure [ beta_errors ] are therefore similar in magnitude to the statistical error expected from the full sdss redshift survey , which will cover 8000 square degrees with a median galaxy redshift @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "table 3 summarizes the performance of the four @xmath5-estimators , listing the mean and rms value of the fractional errors plotted in figure [ beta_errors ] .",
    "note , however , that the numbers depend on the particular set of models we have chosen , so they are only a rough indicator . for @xmath43 , our procedure of fitting a straight line to the measurements above 10",
    "gives a precise but not accurate value of @xmath39 , as seen earlier in figure [ xi_zr ] .",
    "the mean offset is 5.9% for @xmath44 and 10.9% for @xmath45 .",
    "the rms values of @xmath38 are only slightly larger , consistent with the small scatter around the the mean offset seen in figure [ beta_errors ] , though for @xmath45 there is a weak but clearly significant trend of @xmath38 with @xmath5 . increasing the minimum fit radius above 10  reduces the correlation but does not eliminate the higher mean error .",
    "the @xmath46 fits yield accurate @xmath5 estimates , with mean errors of less than @xmath47 that are within the statistical uncertainty of our calculations .",
    "the rms errors are only @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "velocity bias does have a noticeable effect on the @xmath46 estimator , with @xmath50 changes in @xmath31 producing @xmath51 changes in @xmath39 .",
    "errors for the quadrupole estimators @xmath52 and @xmath53 are larger , in part because of our larger statistical uncertainties , but also because of stronger variation with model parameters .",
    "velocity bias has a significant impact on @xmath52 , with @xmath50 changes in @xmath31 producing @xmath54 changes in @xmath39 for @xmath44 . for @xmath53",
    "the effect is smaller , @xmath55 .",
    "the slope traced by the triangular points shows that the bias of the @xmath53 estimator changes steadily with @xmath1 , from @xmath56 at @xmath57 to @xmath58 at @xmath59 for @xmath44 .",
    "a similar trend with @xmath1 appears in the constant-@xmath5 sequence .",
    "for comparison , the lower panels of figure [ beta_errors ] show the results of applying the hc99 and linear - exponential models to our simulation results .",
    "the hc99 procedure is applied to @xmath52 measurements with @xmath60 , and we implemented the linear - exponential model by minimizing @xmath61 with respect to for all data with @xmath62 .",
    "note the larger vertical scale on these panels . the hc99 simulations emphasized values of @xmath63 , and for @xmath64 we also find it to be fairly accurate , with a bias @xmath65 .",
    "however , for lower @xmath5 values the hc99 procedure substantially overestimates the true @xmath5 , and our modification defined by equation ( [ e.fpkqp ] ) is a major improvement .",
    "the linear - exponential model performs reasonably well for @xmath44 , but there is a steady trend from positive bias at low @xmath5 to negative bias at high @xmath5 , and the rms error of @xmath66 is substantially larger than for any of our estimators . increasing the minimum fitting scale from 5  to 10  makes little difference . for @xmath45",
    "the linear - exponential model breaks down more seriously , overestimating @xmath5 by up to 40% , and showing strong correlation of the @xmath39 error with @xmath5 and with @xmath1 .    by determining non - linear scales directly from the data , our @xmath5-fitting procedures",
    "avoid any explicit dependence on @xmath1 , @xmath0 , or @xmath31 . or course , for known values of @xmath1 or @xmath31 , one could use figure [ beta_errors ] to remove the bias of the estimator , further improving its accuracy .",
    "our fitting formulas ( [ e.fpkqp])([e.fxiqp ] ) are obtained empirically , with only a qualitative relation to a full physical model .",
    "however , they successfully describe models with a wide range of physical parameters , and we will show in  4.5 below that the non - linear scales in these fits depend on @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath31 in physically sensible ways .",
    "the estimates based on redshift - space to real - space ratios , @xmath46 and @xmath43 , perform more robustly than those involving quadrupole moments , once the linear theory estimate from @xmath43 is corrected for systematic bias .",
    "furthermore , the monopole components @xmath67 and @xmath68 can be measured with higher precision than the quadrupoles @xmath69 and @xmath70 , for a data set of fixed size .",
    "however , we have not addressed the problem of determining the real - space quantities @xmath11 and @xmath71 .",
    "@xcite propose methods for recovering the former , by combining the monopole , quadrupole , and hexadecapole on large scales , and using the power in modes transverse to the line of sight on small scales .",
    "for @xmath71 , one can invert the projected correlation function  ( see @xcite ) . alternatively , having fit  with an hod model , one can take the three - dimensional correlation function of that model to represent .",
    "it is possible that estimating @xmath11 or  in these ways will degrade the performance of the redshift - to - real space estimators , introducing systematic errors or larger statistical errors .",
    "we leave that question to future work that involves mock catalogs tailored to specific data sets .      with sufficiently good observational data",
    ", the procedures described in  4.3 can provide estimates of @xmath72 that are accurate to a few percent or better .",
    "for a specified value of @xmath0 , this estimate in turn yields an estimate of @xmath73 .",
    "however , for cosmological purposes we are less interested in @xmath73 _ per se _ than in the dark matter fluctuation amplitude @xmath1 . in this paper",
    "we define @xmath73 to be the mean value of @xmath74^{1/2}$ ] over the range 4  @xmath75 12 , where the average is inverse variance weighted and @xmath76 is the non - linear correlation function of the simulation dark matter particles .",
    "the value of @xmath73 is insensitive to increases in the inner or outer cutoff on the averaging regions , though it drops if the minimum radius is pushed much below 4 .",
    "for example , changing the range to 10  @xmath77 25 , changes @xmath73 of the central model from 1.041 to 1.026 , the largest change of the five models .    the standard analytic approximation for the large - scale bias factor ,    @xmath78    describes our numerical results for @xmath73 with an rms error of 0.4% for @xmath44 and 0.6% for @xmath45 , if we use the halo bias formula @xmath79 of @xcite and the halo mass function @xmath80 of @xcite .",
    "the bias @xmath73 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath1 , since we match the same galaxy correlation function by construction .",
    "the most robust way to convert a value of @xmath39 to a value of @xmath1 ( for a specified @xmath0 ) is to consider a sequence of models of increasing @xmath1 , carry out hod fits to match the observed projected correlation function  in each case , compute @xmath73 from @xmath81 using equation ( [ e.bg_hod ] ) , and pick the value of @xmath1 for which @xmath82 .    by definition , @xmath1 is given by an integral over the linear theory dark matter power spectrum @xmath27 .",
    "in the linear approximation , where @xmath83 , one can use an estimated @xmath73 and the measured galaxy power spectrum @xmath84 to normalize @xmath27 and thus compute @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ linear_bias ] compares our definition of @xmath73 ( horizontal lines ) to the power spectrum ratios @xmath85^{1/2}$ ] of the @xmath44 simulations .",
    "for all five values of @xmath1 , the power spectrum ratios are consistent with a constant asymptotic value at large scales , and this asymptotic value is consistent with the value of @xmath73 defined from the correlation function ratio .",
    "however , even with our @xmath86 simulations , we can not make this comparison at a precision better than a few percent because there are relatively few fourier modes in the asymptotic regime .",
    "furthermore , the power spectrum ratios lie slightly above @xmath73 for @xmath57 and slightly below for @xmath59 , with a steady trend in between .",
    "the same trend appears in table 1 , where the product @xmath87 rises from 0.81 to 0.88 as @xmath1 grows from 0.6 to 0.95 .",
    "thus , simply normalizing @xmath27 by @xmath88 would not accurately describe our results at the few percent level .",
    "the trend of @xmath87 arises because we set our hod parameters by fitting the galaxy correlation function in the linear and non - linear regime ; at the few percent level , our large - scale galaxy correlation function is higher for high @xmath1 ( see figure [ real_space_xi ] ) .",
    "if we forced a perfect match of the galaxy correlation function at large scales , then @xmath87 would be constant , but we could no longer match  as well at small scales , at least with our three - parameter hod",
    ".    the passage from @xmath5 and @xmath0 to @xmath1 would be easy if we defined the galaxy bias @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the ( non - linear , shot noise subtracted ) rms galaxy count fluctuation in 8  spheres . in this case , one could simply divide @xmath39 by @xmath91 and multiply by the measured @xmath90 to obtain @xmath1 .",
    "we have tried to develop procedures like those in  4.3 to estimate @xmath92 . however , once we tune the estimation formulas to the @xmath44 simulations , they do not provide accurate results for @xmath45 , in contrast to our procedures for @xmath5 , which give accurate results for both power spectrum shapes .",
    "an 8  top - hat does not suppress non - linear clustering enough for the bias factor @xmath93 to approximate bias in the linear regime ( as also noted by hc99 ) .    in paper ii",
    ", we develop an analytic approach that circumvents the complication of mapping @xmath5 into the @xmath94 parameter space , as the fitting parameters are @xmath95 , without reference to @xmath5 .",
    "the distortions in redshift - to - real space and quadrupole - to - monopole ratios in figures [ pk_zr ] and [ xi_qp ] are driven mainly by galaxy velocity dispersions on small and intermediate scales , which drive down the redshift - space correlation amplitude and reverse the sign of quadrupole distortions .",
    "the non - linear length scales in equations ( [ e.pkzr ] ) , ( [ e.pkqp ] ) , and ( [ e.xiqp ] ) , and the radius @xmath96 at which @xmath97 , therefore encode information about the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath31 , as an increase in any of these variables increases the galaxy velocity dispersion .",
    "the dependence of the galaxy velocity dispersion on @xmath0 is straightforward : at fixed @xmath1 , the large - scale velocity field follows the linear theory scaling @xmath91 , and the virial velocities of halos of fixed abundance scale as @xmath98 ( ignoring the small dependence of halo concentration on @xmath0 ) .",
    "these two effects appear at different scales , but we find that the pairwise galaxy velocity dispersion scales roughly as @xmath99 in our simulations at all separations . for @xmath1 and @xmath31 ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "velocity bias is most influential at small scales , where the galaxy pairs come from within one halo . at larger scales ,",
    "a significant fraction of pairs involve the central galaxies of low - mass halos , and are thus not affected by satellite velocity bias .",
    "inspection of our numerical results suggests that at large separations the pairwise dispersion scales as @xmath100 .",
    "the power spectrum normalization affects the galaxy velocity dispersion in two ways : at linear scales the halo velocity dispersion increases linearly with @xmath1 , while the internal velocity dispersions of halos hosting multiple galaxies increase with @xmath1 because of the higher halo masses .",
    "inspection of the analytic solution for @xmath46 in the linear - exponential model ( see @xcite ,  2.1 ) implies that the non - linear scale @xmath101 where @xmath102 should scale linearly with the velocity dispersion @xmath19 at fixed @xmath5 and approximately as @xmath103 at fixed @xmath19 . with the scalings",
    "@xmath104 discussed above , we obtain    @xmath105    where the last relation uses @xmath106 .",
    "the left - hand panel of figure [ r0_4win ] plots @xmath101 against @xmath107 , a combination of parameters chosen by trial and error to yield minimal scatter .",
    "the numerical data form a tight power - law for the @xmath44 models .",
    "the statistical errors derived from the run - to - run dispersion are of order the point size , and the fit has a @xmath61 per degree of freedom of 8.9 , indicating that most of the model - to - model scatter is physical in origin .",
    "the data for the @xmath45 models follow the same slope , but the amplitude of the relation is 5% higher , and there is more scatter . the dotted line plotted in the panel is a least squares fit to the @xmath44 data .",
    "the slope is @xmath108 , making a scaling of @xmath109 .",
    "given the approximate nature of the arguments behind equation ( [ e.lam1 ] ) , the agreement with the numerically derived scaling is quite good .",
    "the lower index on @xmath31 in the numerical results arises because the scale @xmath110  is outside the one - halo regime where @xmath111 but not fully in the large scale regime where @xmath112 .",
    "the remaining panels of figure [ r0_4win ] plot the other non - linear length scales against a combination of parameters chosen by trial and error to produce minimum scatter . for the central model ,",
    "the @xmath52 zero - crossing @xmath113 is slightly smaller than @xmath101 , @xmath113 is @xmath114 times the @xmath53 zero - crossing @xmath115 , and @xmath115 is @xmath116 times the scale @xmath96 at which @xmath117 .",
    "dotted lines show best - fit power - law relations , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "scatter for the quadrupole length scales is consistent with the statistical errors ( see panel b ) , which are larger for these measurements .    in principle",
    ", these non - linear length scales can help determine cosmological parameters by adding another observable quantity to break degeneracies in our three - dimensional parameter space .",
    "for example , once @xmath5 is fixed by the large - scale distortions , the measurement of @xmath101 constrains the parameter combination @xmath121 . since the different length scales have different parameter dependencies , once can use combinations to isolate @xmath31 and @xmath1 . for example , the best - fit power laws imply    @xmath122    the models with no velocity bias ( @xmath123 ) follow this relation with an rms error of 3.8% and a mean error of @xmath124 . for the models with @xmath125 , equation ( [ e.av_scalelength ] ) predicts 0.80 and 1.10 respectively .",

    "while the non - linear length scales give some measure of small - scale velocities , we can characterize these velocities more physically and more accurately by focusing on distortions at small , where they dominate .",
    "the traditional measure of small - scale distortions is the pairwise velocity dispersion , but this is not a direct observable ; it is extracted from the data by fitting a model that specifies the scale dependence of the mean pairwise velocity of galaxies and the form of the velocity distribution ( e.g. , davis & peebles 1983 ) .",
    "we would prefer a quantity that is measured directly from the data , and here we follow the lead of fisher  ( 1994 ) , who use @xmath127 at fixed , small . referring back to figure [ sigma_pi ]",
    ", we see that @xmath127 at small  is constant for a range of , before turning over at a scale determined by the galaxy velocity dispersion .",
    "we can quantify this turnover by the measure @xmath128 , the value of  at which the correlation function decreases by a factor of two relative to its value at @xmath129 .",
    "more generally , one could use the shape of @xmath130 over some range of the line - of - sight separation , scaling by @xmath131 to remove the sensitivity of the distortion measure to the exact value of the real - space correlation function .",

    "all the curves have a characteristic wave pattern , which rises to a maximum at @xmath132  and reaches a minimum at @xmath133 .",
    "the rise at small separation is the result of including one - halo galaxy pairs from increasingly more massive halos with higher velocity dispersions .",
    "the minimum at 1  occurs near the one - halo to two - halo transition in the real - space . at this separation ,",
    "two - halo pairs come largely from the central galaxies of lower mass halos , so they do not have an internal dispersion contribution , and the halo pairwise velocities themselves are relatively low . at @xmath134 ,",

    "these pairs have large velocity dispersion and are therefore spread out along the line of sight , increasing @xmath128 .    in panel ( c ) , with fixed @xmath1 and @xmath31 , changing @xmath0 affects @xmath128 at all @xmath140 .",
    "higher @xmath0 increases both halo pairwise velocities and internal velocity dispersions , thus increasing @xmath128 on all scales where dispersion dominates over coherent flows .",

    "the higher @xmath0 models ( with lower @xmath1 ) have smaller @xmath128 ; the depression seen in panel ( b ) wins out over the enhancement in panel ( c ) .",
    "thus , at fixed @xmath5 and @xmath31 , the small scale distortions can break the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "panel ( e ) shows models with varying @xmath31 but constant @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( and thus constant @xmath5 ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the @xmath142 model has very small values of @xmath128 relative to the central model at scales less than 10 .",
    "the effect of moderate velocity bias is most significant at the smallest , with 20% changes in @xmath128 at @xmath143  for @xmath144 or 0.8 .",
    "however , these @xmath31 variations have little impact at large , where 20% changes of internal velocity dispersions are small compared to halo velocities themselves , and the effect is essentially zero at @xmath133 . at this separation ,",
    "two - halo pairs begin to dominate , but  is still smaller than the virial radii of large halos .",
    "most pairs therefore come from halos that contain a central galaxy and no satellites , and the value of @xmath31 has no effect .",
    "central galaxy velocities have maximum effect at the @xmath145  scale , for the same reason .",
    "setting @xmath146 boosts @xmath128 by 5 - 10% at this , while treating central galaxies like satellites ( @xmath147 ) boosts it by a factor of two .",
    "panel ( f ) plots the results for the constant  sequence with @xmath45 , once again normalized by the @xmath44 central model . as in panel",
    "( b ) , @xmath1 has minimal effect at small scales and makes the most difference at @xmath148 .",
    "the higher @xmath128 at large  in the @xmath45 models probably reflects the shallower real - space correlation function at these scales .",
    "figure [ rhalf_sigma ] demonstrates that @xmath128 is a robust diagnostic for @xmath0 and @xmath31 when  is small , independent of @xmath1 or @xmath30 . in figure [ rhalf_0.1and3]a , the upper points plot @xmath149 against @xmath150 for all of the @xmath44 models ( except those with @xmath142 and @xmath147 ) .",
    "the data follow a power law with a slope of 0.46 and minimal scatter . for one - halo pairs ,",
    "the redshift - space separation depends on relative velocities , which are proportional to @xmath151 , and one might therefore expect a slope of 0.5 . because there is a small two - halo contribution to at these separations ,",
    "the slope deviates slightly from this expectation .",
    "the data for @xmath45 follow a similar power law , but with a normalization @xmath152 lower , as expected from the results in figure [ rhalf_sigma]f .",
    "this offset may arise partly from the difference in the real - space correlation function , which is shallower for @xmath45 , and partly from the difference in the halo mass function , which changes the relative importance of pairs from different halos .",
    "the values of @xmath5 and @xmath149 provide two observable constraints in our three - dimensional @xmath95 parameter space , measuring the combinations @xmath153 and @xmath37 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath128 at somewhat larger  has the possibility of providing a third constraint on a different combination of these parameters .",
    "based on the power - law fit in figure [ rhalf_0.1and3]a , each constant-@xmath5 model was given the value of @xmath31 required to match @xmath149 of the central model .",
    "relative to figure [ rhalf_sigma]d at fixed , this scaling brings curves together at @xmath154 , but it makes little difference at larger separations where @xmath31 has little effect . differentiating between adjacent models requires high precision in the measurements , but there is a clear , 20% separation between the low and high values of @xmath1 with this diagnostic . in figure [ rhalf_0.1and3]b , we plot @xmath128 against @xmath1 for @xmath155 , and 5 . at each transverse separation",
    ", there is a monotonic , nearly linear trend with @xmath1 once @xmath5 and @xmath149 have been fixed .",
    "these results allow for unambiguous determination of @xmath1 , breaking the third and last degeneracy in the parameter space .",
    "figure [ rhalf_0.1and3]b assumes @xmath156 , and central galaxy velocities could interfere with this approach to breaking degeneracies .",
    "for example , adopting @xmath146 increases @xmath149 by @xmath157 , which is of order the effect of changing @xmath1 by 0.1 . however , the effects of moderate @xmath158 on this measure go away at scales larger than 3 , where there is still clear model differentiation in figures [ rhalf_sigma]d and [ rhalf_0.1and3]b .",
    "as we have already noted , physical arguments and hydrodynamic simulations support the assumption of low @xmath158 , but further theoretical and observational investigation of this point is warranted .",
    "our results provide a blueprint for obtaining constraints in the @xmath95 parameter space from measurements of clustering anisotropy in redshift space . for each model in the parameter space , one first chooses hod parameters to reproduce measurements of the projected galaxy correlation function , which depends only on the real - space correlation function . if the assumed power spectrum shape is correct , it will generally be possible to match  well for a wide range of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . at large scales , the anisotropy ratios",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath52 , @xmath43 or @xmath53 then depend on @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath1 for fixed galaxy clustering ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "these measures scale with cosmological parameters as predicted by linear theory and the linear bias model ( @xcite ) , even though these approximations do not provide an accurate description of anisotropy on most scales accessible to observations or to our simulations .",
    "one can estimate @xmath5 by fitting @xmath46 , @xmath52 , or @xmath53 as a function of scale using our equations ( [ e.fpkqp ] ) , ( [ e.fpkzr ] ) , and ( [ e.fxiqp ] ) , or by measuring @xmath43 at @xmath161  and correcting for the @xmath162 bias of linear theory ( see figure [ beta_errors ] )",
    ". the turnover scales in the fitting functions depend on the velocity bias @xmath31 , but they can be measured directly from the anisotropy ratios , so the @xmath5 estimates themselves are largely independent of @xmath31 .",
    "the turnover scales can be used to break degeneracies in the parameter space , but the line - of - sight correlation function @xmath127 at fixed , small  provides a more direct measure of velocity distortions in the highly non - linear regime . in particular , for small  the scale @xmath128 defined by @xmath163 , quantifies the typical length of `` fingers - of - god , '' and hence the characteristic amplitude of pairwise velocity dispersions . at @xmath164 , where most pairs come from intermediate mass halos , we find that @xmath128 depends on @xmath37 with essentially no dependence on @xmath1 . at @xmath165",
    ", @xmath128 has a significant dependence on @xmath1 even at fixed @xmath5 and @xmath31 , with @xmath166 corresponding to @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , one can in principle use measurements of large - scale anisotropy and @xmath127 at @xmath168  to separately determine the values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath31 .",
    "alternatively , one can measure @xmath5 and @xmath150 as described above and adopt theoretical priors on @xmath31 from hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. , berlind 2003 ) , or combine redshift - space distortions with other observables that constrain different combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . for example , galaxy - galaxy lensing measurements constrain @xmath169 ( instead of @xmath153 ) from the ratio of the galaxy - mass correlation function to the galaxy autocorrelation function ( sheldon 2004 ) .",
    "the galaxy bispectrum can yield a direct estimate of @xmath1 by determining the large - scale galaxy bias factor ( fry 1994 ; verde 2002 ) .",
    "our blueprint has significant advantages relative to the linear - exponential model or the alternative fitting procedure of hc99 .",
    "first , our approach is more accurate for a wide range of cosmological models ( figs .",
    "[ kaiser_compare ] , [ beta_errors ] ) .",
    "averaging over both values of @xmath30 used , our fitting function for @xmath46 yields @xmath5 with an rms error of 1.6% for the range of models presented . for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 diagnostics , the fitting functions yield rms errors of 4.1% and 3.9% respectively .",
    "second , our approach makes use of the small - scale anisotropy as a tool for breaking parameter degeneracies , instead of treating the galaxy dispersion as a nuisance parameter .",
    "constraints on @xmath1 and @xmath31 from these small scale measures can be used to further improve the @xmath5 estimate .",
    "the fitting formulas presented here are designed to allow straightforward parameter estimation given measurements of  and @xmath170 .",
    "alternatively , one can use simulations to calibrate a fully analytic description of redshift - space anisotropy , in which case one can fit data directly using @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath31 as the fitting parameters .",
    "we will develop such a model in paper ii ; achieving the accuracy demanded by data sets like the sdss and the 2dfgrs is not easy , but it is possible .",
    "the analytic method is more flexible than the fitting formula approach , allowing one to take more complete advantage of information in  or @xmath170 . at the opposite extreme",
    ", one can circumvent analytic formulations entirely and fit data by directly populating halos of n - body simulations and measuring anisotropy , using the @xmath0-scaling technique of this paper to improve efficiency . with large volume simulations that resolve the necessary halo masses , this method should achieve the highest accuracy because it fully describes non - linear halo clustering , and it can address corrections to the distant - observer approximation and other technical issues that are difficult to model analytically . in practice , it will probably be best to use the fitting formulas or an analytic model to locate the most interesting regions of parameter space , then use focused numerical simulations to check and refine estimates .    for the @xmath142 model , large - scale anisotropy measures agree reasonably with linear theory over a substantial range in scale .",
    "this result suggests that fog compression plus linear theory is a viable alternative approach to estimating @xmath5 .",
    "assessing the systematic uncertainties of this method requires tests with realistic mock catalogs that quantify the ability of the fog compression algorithm to correctly identify and compress true fogs in galaxy survey data .",
    "there are several limitations to our blueprint . with two exceptions",
    ", we have assumed that central galaxies move with the center of mass of the halo , i.e.  @xmath156 .",
    "changing @xmath158 to 0.2 makes minimal difference in both the large scale measures and @xmath128 .",
    "however , setting @xmath171 makes a considerable difference .",
    "current hydrodynamical simulations ( berlind  2003 ) suggest @xmath172 is a reasonable assumption , but the issue merits further investigation because of its significant impact on redshift - space anisotropy modeling .",
    "analysis of sdss galaxies shows that central - satellite galaxy pairs indeed have a narrower velocity spread than satellite - satellite pairs ( t. mckay , in preparation ) .",
    "we have also assumed that @xmath31 is independent of halo mass .",
    "this assumption should be adequate because most one - halo pairs come from a limited range of halo masses ; low - mass halos have no satellites , and high - mass halos are rare .",
    "to significantly alter our results , @xmath31 would need to depend strongly on mass in the relatively narrow range @xmath173 , and even then its effect might be well represented by an average value .",
    "the weak mass dependence seen in the simulations analyzed by berlind  ( 2003 ) does not affect the results here , but the question again merits investigation in future hydrodynamic studies of galaxy formation .",
    "one can also test for mass dependence of @xmath31 by comparing the predicted and observed scalings of group velocity dispersions with group richness .",
    "the experiments illustrated in figure [ hod_test ] show that changing the details of the hod , or the assumption about spatial bias within halos , has negligible impact on redshift - space distortions provided one matches the same real - space clustering .",
    "however , our investigation of these points is not exhaustive .",
    "effects of changing @xmath158 , making @xmath31 mass - dependent , or changing hod prescriptions while maintaining  can all be examined in more detail using the analytic model of paper ii .",
    "the simulations presented in this work have less dynamic range than is ideal . at the largest scales , our numerical predictions are less precise than the measurement precision achievable with 2dfgrs or sdss data , though not by a large factor .",
    "we have focused on predictions for luminosity - threshold galaxy samples with space density @xmath174@xmath175 , corresponding roughly to @xmath176 . to make predictions or test fitting formulas for fainter galaxies , which occupy less massive halos",
    ", one would need higher resolution simulations but similar simulation volumes . to get precise results for more luminous galaxies that reside in rare , massive halos ,",
    "one would need larger simulation volumes , though the mass resolution required is lower .",
    "the analytic model described in paper ii can easily be applied to samples with different luminosity or color selection and correspondingly different hods , and it automatically extends to large scales .",
    "however , additional simulations will be needed to test the accuracy of the analytic model in these regimes .",
    "the monopole - to - real space ratios , @xmath46 and @xmath43 , have smaller systematic errors as estimators of @xmath5 than the quadrupole - to - monopole ratios @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "however , we have not addressed the problem of estimating  or @xmath11 from data .",
    "techniques for estimating these quantities exist ( e.g. , davis & peebles 1983 ; hamilton  2000 ; zehavi  2004b ; tegmark  2004a ) , but we do not yet know whether they are accurate at the @xmath177 level required if they are not to contribute significantly to uncertainties in the estimates of @xmath5 .    despite these limitations , our results demonstrate that hod modeling can substantially improve the accuracy and precision of redshift - space distortion analysis by replacing _ ad hoc _ extensions of linear perturbation theory with a complete , fully non - linear description of dark matter dynamics and galaxy bias .",
    "this level of sophistication is required to take full advantage of data provided by the 2dfgrs and sdss .",
    "precise cosmological constraints from galaxy clustering complement those from other cosmological observables like cmb anisotropy , gravitational lensing , the lyman-@xmath178 forest , or type ia supernovae .",
    "they thus enhance the opportunity to detect departures from the simplest  model , which could provide insight into the physics of dark energy or the origin of primordial fluctuations .",
