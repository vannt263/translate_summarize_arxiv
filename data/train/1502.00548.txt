    "in dynamical systems a `` bistability situation '' usually refers to cases where a system has two stable equilibrium states . in a bifurcation diagram",
    "the curve of steady state displays an `` s '' shape as a certain parameter of the system varies .",
    "the `` s '' is delimited by two saddle - node bifurcation points .",
    "between them we have two stable and one unstable steady states ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the corresponding situation in hamiltonian galactic dynamics is depicted in the characteristic of a family of periodic orbits as two successive tangent bifurcations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) facing opposite directions .",
    "these two bifurcations share the same unstable branch .",
    "in other words the characteristic folds twice as the varying parameter , usually the jacobi constant , increases .",
    "foldings of the characteristic have been encountered by @xcite and @xcite , in 3d ferrers bar potentials .",
    "however , the way they affect the face - on morphology of a model has not been examined in those papers . nevertheless , it was clear that the foldings of the characteristics affect to a larger degree slowly rotating models .",
    "in this paper we present the implications of the presence of such a folding of the characteristic of the main family of periodic orbits for the dynamics of a slowly rotating barred - spiral potential .    slowly rotating",
    "models of disc galaxies have been proposed in the past to describe the dynamics of normal ( non - barred ) spiral galaxies with open spiral arms . in these models",
    "( stellar and gaseous ) the symmetric , strong spiral structure extends inside corotation @xcite .",
    "contrarily , in barred galaxy models corotation is usually placed close to the end of the bar @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite presented a list with 32 barred galaxies in which they estimated the ratio of the corotation to the bar radius , @xmath0 , to be between @xmath1 .",
    "model bars ending well inside corotation have been found in n - body simulations @xcite as well as in response models of barred potentials derived from near - infrared observations @xcite . in all these studies , slowly rotating bars are associated with late - type barred - spiral galaxies .",
    "it is generally believed that bars in barred galaxies are supported by the x1 family of elliptical , stable , periodic orbits , which extends along the major axis of the bar @xcite , or , in the three - dimensional case , by the corresponding families of the x1-tree , i.e. by x1 together with 3d families bifurcated at the vertical resonances , @xcite .",
    "the bar is built by trapping quasi - periodic orbits along the orbits of these families .",
    "deviations from this orbital behaviour have been proposed , pointing to bars in which other families than x1 play a significant and perhaps a leading role in the building of the bars .",
    "such behaviours are favoured either in slowly rotating bar models in which the bars end well before corotation @xcite , or in bars with large major to minor axis ratios @xcite .",
    "@xcite even claim , that in slowly rotating bars of the type described by @xcite , there is a better matching of the outer - to - inner ring radial ratio , than in standard fast rotating bars .",
    "finally , @xcite have shown that bars of ansae - type can be supported mainly by chaotic orbits in a ( fast rotating ) model based on the potential of ngc  1300 , estimated from near - infrared observations .",
    "the implications of slow rotation for the orbital dynamics in a _ barred - spiral _ model , i.e. when the spiral component is explicitly included in the potential , have not been extensively studied .",
    "recently @xcite have presented a barred - spiral model , rotating with a single pattern speed , characterized by a ratio @xmath0 , about 2.9 .",
    "this case , with @xmath2  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 , has been considered as `` general '' since several dynamical mechanisms cooperated in forming the obtained barred - spiral response morphology .",
    "the action of two different dynamical mechanisms led to the formation of an inner barred - spiral structure surrounded by an oval - shaped disc and an outer set of spiral arms beyond corotation .",
    "however , if we decrease further the pattern speed , there are even more considerable changes in the orbital dynamics of the system .",
    "the pattern speed , @xmath4 , is the most important parameter for the resulting response morphology of the model .    besides the case presented in @xcite , we have studied a series of models with even smaller @xmath4 down to 10  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 .",
    "as the pattern speed decreases from @xmath2  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 , we have a rather new orbital behaviour , which shapes a different barred - spiral response with distinct morphological features .",
    "for example , despite the fact that the bars in all studied models have comparable sizes , as @xmath4 decreases the orbital dynamics of the central family of periodic orbits changes from that of the typical case @xcite . in the present paper we present these changes ,",
    "we describe the morphological features that are encountered in extremely slowly rotating models , and we discuss its relevance to some morphological features appearing in some images of barred - spiral galaxies .",
    "our general model is the same as in @xcite .",
    "it is based on a modified version of a potential estimated from the near - infrared photometry of the late type barred - spiral galaxy ngc  3359 @xcite .",
    "we used it as a general barred - spiral potential with @xmath4 being a free parameter .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xcite , based on observation by @xcite , estimate the ratio of the semi - major axis of the bar to the length of the rising part of the rotation curve for ngc  3359 to be @xmath5 . according to this work",
    ", the fact that the bar ends before the velocity curve turns over , is an indication for slow bar rotation . despite the difficulties in estimating the inner parts of the rotation curves of barred galaxies , this property is in general associated with slowly rotating bars , like the bars of the models we study . in the series of our response models , since @xmath6  kpc ( see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this ratio varies between 0.619 and 0.641 . in the specific model of the present paper",
    "this ratio is about 0.62 , close to the lowest value .",
    "this means that our potential is adequate for studying slowly rotating models in general .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section  [ sec : model ] we briefly present again our potential ( for more details see * ? ? ?",
    "the results of our study are described in section  [ sec : slow ] and refer to the building of the response features , which are the ring , the bar and the spirals .",
    "these results are discussed in section  [ sec : discuss ] and in section  [ sec : concl ] we enumerate our conclusions .",
    "the model has been extensively described in @xcite .",
    "it is a two dimensional model of the general form @xmath7 the components @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 of the equation above are given as polynomials of the form @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the radial variation of the perturbation force normalized over the radial axisymmetric one is given in figure 1 in @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion are derived from the hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 are the coordinates in a cartesian frame of reference rotating with angular velocity @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the potential ( [ eq : pot ] ) in cartesian coordinates with the bar aligned approximately with the y - axis , @xmath17 is the numerical value of the jacobi constant , hereafter called the energy , and dots denote time derivatives .",
    "by varying @xmath4 between @xmath18  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 , we obtained always a kind of barred - spiral response . in this range of pattern",
    "speeds the corotation radius of the models , @xmath19 , takes values between @xmath20  kpc respectively .",
    "nevertheless , while the pitch angle of the response spirals varied considerably in models with different pattern speeds ( it was larger for lower pattern speeds ) , the radius of the response bar varied only between @xmath21  kpc . for @xmath22",
    "km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 the size of the response bar was clearly decreasing .",
    "for example , for @xmath23  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 we estimated it to be about 2.45  kpc .",

    "[ resp11 ] . in fig .",

    "the x - shaped bar is supported mainly by particles in orbits with initial conditions corresponding to the open bullets in fig .",
    "[ sosmode ] .    by inspection of figs .",
    "[ mode],[sosmode ] and [ modeorbs ] we first realize that the initial conditions supporting the response bar morphology within a certain time are distributed on the surface of section independently of the locations of stability islands or chaotic seas . in general the stability region on poincar cross sections that is excluded from participating in the building of a bar is found around the retrograde family x4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , in studies of barred - spiral potentials estimated from near - infrared observations of galaxies @xcite , it has been realized that there are initial conditions on x1 stability islands , which do not support a particular morphological feature of a bar .",
    "on the other hand , we have found that there are initial conditions in the chaotic seas that reinforce a particular bar morphology @xcite . in the present case",
    "quasi - periodic orbits that support part of the wings of an x feature are encountered at the periphery of the stability island of the x1-like periodic orbit .",
    "as noticed in @xcite the morphology of the periodic orbit at the center of an island may differ from the morphology of the quasi - periodic orbits of the outer invariant curves .",
    "for example , in cases of elliptical x1-like periodic orbits , the quasi - periodic orbits at the edge of the stability island may support an ansae - type morphology . as we see in fig .",
    "[ modeorbs ] the morphology of the innermost quasi - periodic orbits , which is similar to that of the periodic orbit itself , does not resemble that of an x. on the other hand the integrated for 10 - 30 pattern periods chaotic orbits with initial conditions in the chaotic sea surrounding the stability island have a morphology matching that of the response bar ( cf .",
    "[ resp11 ] and fig .",
    "[ modeorbs]e ) .    since morphologies similar to that of fig .",
    "[ modeorbs]e are encountered by integrating the initial conditions corresponding to the open bullets in fig .",
    "[ sosmode ] , we can compare the area these open bullets occupy with the density of the consequents on the surface of section in fig .",
    "it becomes apparent that the open bullets symbols are located in the sticky region , i.e. the region with larger density , surrounding the central stability island in fig .",
    "as regards the study of the orbital morphology it is worth to underline that moving from the center of the stability island outwards and then crossing the surrounding sticky region , we have a smooth morphological transition from narrow non - periodic orbits , along the x - direction , to broader non - periodic orbits , which harbour an x feature .",
    "the energy e@xmath24 = @xmath97 is the mode of the distribution in fig .",
    "however , a similar analysis can be done for every e@xmath24 roughly in the interval @xmath98e@xmath24 @xmath99 ( practically for energies before the `` s '' feature ) .",
    "the non - periodic orbits supporting the x are mainly orbits in the sticky zones surrounding stability islands of x1-like periodic orbits .",

    "the orbital dynamics are similar to those described by @xcite for open _ non - barred _ spirals .",

    "close to r=8  kpc the x1@xmath31 periodic orbits have cusps and a clear rhomboidal morphology .",
    "the bifurcating branches are formed by the congestion of these orbits with more circular orbits further away from the resonance .",

    "because of their association with inner n:1 resonances with n@xmath108 , inner rings are usually orientated along the bar @xcite . in our case",
    "the `` inner '' ring can be characterised as almost circular or rather elongated towards the minor axis of the bar , depending on the energy level of the orbits we consider as the limit between the x2-flow orbits and the orbits that build the spiral .",

    "our model describes a configuration , where ordered and chaotic motion coexist and contribute to the formation of a unique structure .",

    "the mechanism we propose here , i.e. the population of sticky chaotic orbits around the stability islands of the main family of periodic orbits , suggests an explanation of this morphology .",
    "we stress again that the x feature is pronounced in slowly rotating models , but slow rotation does not give the explanation of the feature .",
    "the x appears as soon as the bar is built by sticky chaotic orbits in the chaotic zone surrounding the stability islands of x1-like periodic orbits , as well as by quasi - periodic orbits at the outer parts of these islands .",
    "the potential in the present paper originates in the estimation of the gravitational field of a late - type barred galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , the x feature is expected to appear also in models for early type barred galaxies , provided that the bar is populated by the kind of sticky chaotic orbits we discuss .",

    "such galaxies combine the morphological features of the response model of the present study .",
    "recently @xcite investigated the orbital dynamics of 3d ferrers bars that lead to the formation of boxy features inside the bars in their face - on projections .",
    "despite the fact that the bars in the two cases are approached by different modelling techniques ( 2d vs. 3d dynamics ) , the two studies agree on the character of the orbits that build the boxy features . in both cases we deal with sticky chaotic orbits . similarly with what we find here , also in the 3d models the pool of orbits that are used to build the inner boxes are sticky chaotic orbits around the periodic orbits that constitute the backbones of the bars .",
    "however , the 3d modelling allows us to investigate the connection between the x features appearing in the face - on views and the x features appearing in boxy / peanuts edge - on profiles@xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of our study refer to the dynamics of slowly rotating _ barred - spiral _ models and are enumerated below :    1 .",
    "the characteristic of the main family in our slowly rotating barred - spiral potential includes periodic orbits that are successively ( as e@xmath24 increases ) x1-like , x2-like , as well as elliptical orbits that precess if plotted at different e@xmath24 .",
    "it is characterised by a folding , which we called the `` s '' ( fig .",
    "[ ssos34]a ) .",
    "it is a case of two combined saddle - node bifurcations , usually called `` bistability '' .",
    "along `` s '' the periodic orbits change their orientation .",
    "slow rotation pronounces this folding .",
    "our response model is populated by x1-like orbits up to the e@xmath24 of `` a '' and `` a@xmath31 '' in fig .",

    "it is as if we jump from `` a '' to `` a@xmath31 '' in the characteristic .",
    "the abrupt change of the orientation of the response orbits leads to the formation of a ring in the middle of the characteristic , at the `` s '' region .",
    "the ring does not extend along the bar , as is the usual orientation of inner rings , but it is rather inclined towards the x - axis .",
    "we have effectively a x2 region beyond the end of the bar . the orientation and morphology of the ring resembles more that of nuclear rings .",
    "3 .   bars built mainly by sticky orbits around the stability islands of the central family of periodic orbits have a boxy structure that harbours an x feature in it . in the class of barred - spiral models we consider in the present study ,",
    "the slower the pattern speed of the model , the greater is the importance of the x - feature for the overall morphology of the bar , since it occupies a larger fraction of it .",
