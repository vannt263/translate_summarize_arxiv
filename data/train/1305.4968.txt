    "comet 103p / hartley 2 , hereafter referred to as hartley 2 , was first spotted by m. hartley on march 16 , 1986 .",
    "it has a semi - major axis of @xmath5 , eccentricity @xmath6 , and inclination @xmath7 and an orbital period of 6.46 years .",
    "its low eccentricity made it a suitable target for the extended mission of nasa s deep impact spacecraft after the impact experiment at comet 9p / tempel 1 on july 4 , 2005 .",
    "the mission to hartley 2 was renamed epoxi and given two missions , extrasolar planet observation and characterization(epoch ) , and deep impact extended investigation ( dixi ) .",
    "the epoxi flyby observations at a closest distance of 694 km on november 4 , 2010 , brought a wealth of information on the outgassing activity , shape and surface structure of this small jupiter family comet ( ahearn et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "for example , the strong outflows of the co@xmath0-rich jet from the sun - lit end of the bowling - pin shaped and the h@xmath0o - rich jet in the waist region came as a surprise .",
    "how would they be connected to the large - scale jet structures observed in the coma ? how would the outgassing process be modulated by the rotation of the comet nucleus ?",
    "in fact , based on the time variability of the cn coma morphology and millimeter / sub - millimeter spectra , the rotation period of hartley 2 has been found to be increasing from 16.7 hr in august , 2010 , to 18.4 hr in the first half of november and then to nearly 19 hr in late november @xcite .",
    "such time variations of the nucleus rotation period together with the close - up measurements by the epoxi mission demonstrate the complex nature of the surface outgassing process .    in anticipation of the scientific opportunity to compare the large - scale coma structures and gas production rates of hartley 2 with the epoxi results ,",
    "we have made a long - term monitoring program from april to december , 2010 , using imaging with both broadband and narrowband filters , and long - slit spectrophotometry .",
    "this cooperative effort involved observations at the lulin observatory in taiwan , the calar alto observatory in spain , and the beijing astronomical observatory in china .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will explain the observational procedures , instruments and analysis methods . in section 3 , the derived morphology and gas production of the cn coma and jets will be described . in section 4",
    ", we will describe the dust jets and the structure of the dust coma during this period .",
    "a summary of the major characteristics of the large - scaled structures of the gas and dust comas of harley 2 is given in section 5 .",
    "* imaging : * the bulk of the photometric imaging observations was done by using the lulin one - meter telescope ( lot ) at lulin observatory . in our first image of hartley 2 on april 24 , 2010 , when the comet was 2.42 au away from the sun and 2.36 au from the earth , only a diffuse coma of 5 \" diameter was visible with 10-min exposure time .",
    "there was no tail feature . in the monitoring program , an asahi r broadband filter and the narrowband filters of the rosetta filter set",
    "were used .",
    "the specifications of these narrowband filters are given as @xmath8 both in nm , @xmath9 being the central wavelength and @xmath10 the band width : cn ( 387/5 nm ) , c@xmath11 ( 512.5/12.5 nm ) , blue continuum bc ( 443/4 nm ) , and red continuum rc ( 684/9 nm ) .",
    "because of the consideration of the signal - to - noise ratio , the narrowband filters were used only in october and november 2 just before the epoxi close encounter . the camera used on lot from april to november was pi 1300b which has a pixel scale of 0.516 arcsec and a field of view of @xmath12 arcmin . in late - november 2010",
    ", there was a cooling problem with pi1300b .",
    "we , therefore , switched to u42 ccd which has @xmath13 pixels and a field of view of @xmath14 arcmin .",
    "the telescope was always operated with non - sidereal tracking so as not to produce trail in the comet images .",
    "typical integration were 600s @xmath15 900s for the narrowband filters and 30s @xmath15 300s for the broadband r filter .",
    "table 1 is the observational log of our program .",
    "standard procedure of data reduction was applied .",
    "it began with dark current subtraction and flat - field correction of all image frames .",
    "this was then followed by the subtraction of the night sky contribution . for the observations obtained before late - september",
    ", the night sky levels were determined directly areas of the ccd frames that do not contain contributions from the cometary emission .",
    "however , the sky - background of those images taken from late - september to early - november was all influenced by the cometary coma .",
    "therefore , we took sky background images positioned at about 0.5 degrees away from the comet center .",
    "the extinction coefficients of the narrowband and broadband r filters were determined for all nights with photometric sky conditions , using the photometric stars like feige 110 and gd71 , observed at different airmasses during the night .",
    "for example , the first order extinction coefficient ( in units of magnitudes per air mass ) measured by feige 110 with observing airmass range from 1.1 to 1.7 for r - filter on october 29 is 0.10 and for cn and c@xmath0 are 0.39 and 0.14 , respectively .",
    "these data were used to convert the measured counting rates into physical units and the detail has been described in lin et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "because the cn images contain @xmath16 contribution from the continuum in the blue range while the c@xmath0 images have as much as @xmath17 , the net cn and c@xmath0 gas coma images need to go through the subtraction procedure according to the following formulas : cn= cn@xmath18 - 0.29 bc@xmath18 , c@xmath0 = c@xmath19 - 0.93 bc@xmath18 .",
    "in addition to lulin observations , the coma activity of 103p / hartley 2 was also monitored continuously in r - band from the calar alto observatory ( near almeria , spain ) from july 14 to december 26 , 2010 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we used the cafos imaging camera ( @xmath13 pixels , pixel size : 053 , fov @xmath20 ) which was mounted on the 2.2 m telescope . in our observations ,",
    "only the central 1k x 1k pixels were used , providing thus a fov of @xmath21 .",
    "appropriate bias and flat field frames were taken each night .",
    "if photometric conditions prevailed , photometric standard stars were observed at airmass similar to the comet observations .",
    "table [ obslog ] contains the observations log for the complete dataset .",
    "notice that a larger number of night mentioned in table [ obslog ] is for the af@xmath2 estimation and some of them are not used to enhance the structures in the coma because the snr was too low .",
    "* spectroscopy : * spectroscopic measurements were planned once every month using cafos with grism b400 ( see http://www.caha.es/alises/cafos/cafos22.pdf ) which renders an spectral range between 3,200 and 8,800   with a wavelength scale of 9.4  / pixel .",
    "the slit of the spectrograph was oriented in the north - south direction , giving dust and gas profiles at different cross - cuts through the coma , depending on the pa of the sun - comet vector on the sky . for absolute calibration , observations of appropriate spectrophotometric standard stars were acquired .",
    "all comet observations were done with telescope tracking on hartley 2 . with the exception of nov .",
    "5 , 2010 , all observations were done in service mode of the calar alto observatory .",
    "details on the images and spectra reduction and calibration can be found in lara et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2011a ) and they will not be repeated here .",
    "if the gas coma covered the whole slit , the sky level was estimated from the edges of the frame .",
    "otherwise , the background could be measured directly by using regions near the edges of the frame .    besides spectra obtained from the calar alto observatory ,",
    "spectroscopic observations were also performed on october 9 and october 11 at the beijing astronomical observatory using the 2.16 m telescope in the spectral range between 3,600 @xmath22 to 8,400 @xmath22 at a dispersion 4.8  / pixel .",
    "the spectroscopic data were reduced following the standard procedures including bias and flat - field corrections and cosmic ray removal .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed based on helium - argon lamps exposed at both the beginning and the end of the observations every night .",
    "flux calibration of all spectra were conducted based on observations of at least one of the spectral standard stars , i.e. , hd19445 and the atmospheric extinction effect was corrected by the mean extinction coefficients measured by the beijing - arizona - taiwan - connecticut ( batc ) multicolor survey .",
    "see lin et al .",
    "( 2007a ) for more detailed information .",
    "in order to study the visibility of faint structures of the gas coma of comet hartley 2 , an image enhancement technique was applied to the present set of images .",
    "the method used here is the azimuthally averaged profile division , a detailed description which can be found in lin et al .",
    "this method was applied to all images taken in the cn filter , in continuum filters and in the r - band filter .    to estimate the rotational phase from cn morphology , a lot of observing data have to be acquired in consecutive night . however , the images obtained in our observing nights with less temporal coverage were not enough to estimate and display rotational period due to snapshot observations , poor weather and telescope tracking problem",
    ". we , therefore , use the known periodicity to estimate the rotational phase in our images .",
    "however , we have to face several problems : a non - principal axis rotation of comet hartley 2 and a rapid change of the viewing geometry might cause different periodicities between rotational cycles .",
    "a specific phase is really only applicable to a short stretch of data if we adopt known periodicity such as 18.15 hr in mid - october and 18.7hr in early - november from knight and schleicher ( 2011 ) or 18.22 hr around perihelion from harmon et al .",
    "notice that those ground - based observations have error bars between 0.01 and 0.3 .",
    "the most robust rotation period at present is from the epoxi spacecraft lightcurve given in belton et al .",
    "this gives a spin period of 18.40 hr at encounter and states that it was increasing by 1.3 minutes / day .",
    "as the data acquired with the rosetta filter set spread around one month , it is appropriate to use the midpoint of the observational time interval for this period of time .",
    "we extrapolate the rotation period back to midpoint assuming the rotation period was steadily changing during this time frame .",
    "therefore , the rotation period quoted in this work is 18.11 hr on october 21.5 ut which refers to the midpoint of the oct 10-nov 2 data .",
    "the zero phase is set at 11:40 ut on october 10 , 2010 .    in figure",
    "[ cnjet ] , we can see that the morphology of the cn coma extended almost perfectly along the east - west direction in early october and the north - south direction around hartley 2 s perihelion .",
    "the cn images all showed clear asymmetries before performing the image enhancement .",
    "one of these unprocessed cn images is given by contour plot in figure 1 ( top - left panel ) .",
    "the variations in between early - october and around its perihelion in the cn jet features are related to the spin period of the comet nucleus , the changing viewing geometry and non - principal axis rotation as has already been reported by samarasinha et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , knight and schleicher ( 2011 ) , lara et al .",
    "( 2011b ) and waniak et al .",
    "the processed cn images from the observations between october 11 and november 2 revealed two jets in the coma of comet hartley 2 .",
    "the cn jet features being nearly perpendicular to the sun - tail direction not only varied smoothly during a night but showed similar morphology near its perihelion even though the rotational state was different .",
    "we compared the morphology of the cn jet features with those presented by knight and schleicher ( 2011 ) , and samarasinha et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and found that the cn jet features of hartley 2 did not show the spiral - like structure in early - october but was compatible with the observations obtained by knight and schleicher ( 2011 ) and lara et al .",
    "( 2011b ) in late - october",
    ". the reason could be the observing geometry , i.e. , whether it is observed from the face - on or side - on .",
    "knight and schleicher ( 2011 ) confirmed this effect from the images that revealed the face - on spiral structures in august and september .",
    "furthermore , we found these two cn jet features to be asymmetrical .",
    "one of them is always brighter than the other , possibly because it is facing toward the earth .",
    "for example , the southern jet of the images obtained from october 25 to october 27 is slightly stronger than the northern jet of those images .",
    "such asymmetrical features have also been reported in earliler works by samarasinha et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , lara et al .",
    "( 2011b ) and waniak et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .      in order to determine the gas production rates , the mean radial emission profiles of cn and c@xmath11 were derived from the images with the continuum subtracted . regarding the spectra of the comet acquired at calar alto observatory and beijing astronomical observatory ,",
    "they are also used to investigate the cn , c@xmath23 , c@xmath11 and nh@xmath11 profiles in the north - south direction and to derive the production rates of these gaseous species .",
    "the spectral regions and the subtraction of the underlying continuum in the gas emission bands were done as described by lara et al .",
    "the conversion of the emission band fluxes into column densities made use of fluorescence efficiency factors ( @xmath24factors ) for c@xmath23 , c@xmath11 and nh@xmath11 @xcite , whereas the @xmath24factors of the cn molecule was calculated for the heliocentric distance and velocity of 103p / hartley 2 on every date from the set of values given by schleicher @xcite .",
    "the gas production rates are obtained by means of the haser @xcite model for isotropic emission of cometary neutral molecules and their daughter molecules and radicals .",
    "the parameter used for the parent velocity is v@xmath25 = 0.85 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xcite and for the daughter velocity it is 1 @xmath28 . for the corresponding set of parameters in the haser model",
    ", we produced theoretical column density profiles for each species by varying the production rate until the best match between observations and theoretical predictions is achieved .",
    "the results of nightly averages for q(cn ) , q(c@xmath29 ) , q(c@xmath11 ) and q(nh@xmath0 ) are summarized in table  [ qs ] .",
    "table [ qs ] also contains the average gas production rates obtained from the images acquired in one night together with the aperture size we have considered to derive q. the variation of production rates seen in multiple measurements during a night were less than 5% that is reflected in the uncertainties in table  [ qs ] .",
    "our results on q(c@xmath11 ) are less numerous as there were tracking problems at lot from october 10@xmath1511 and october 25@xmath1527 , whereas the long - slit spectroscopic measurements could provide q(c@xmath0 ) at other dates thus spanning larger heliocentric distances .",
    "our lulin , bao and ca results in table  [ qs ] show that there is no significant variation of q(cn ) from mid - october to early - november .",
    "this result is consistent with the lara et al .",
    "( 2011b ) and mumma et al .",
    "( 2011 ) results that assumed that hcn is the main parent species of cn and that expected variation of q(hcn ) around the perihelion is not very large . notice that we used the mean radial profile to estimate the gas production rate from the images obtained from lulin observatory .",
    "however , if we averaged the radial profile in the north - south direction where the cn jet feature exists , the derived q(cn ) would be larger in a factor of two to three when compared with the azimuthally averaged radial profile .",
    "figure  [ cnc2 ] shows the logarithm of the production rate for cn and c@xmath11 as a function of the heliocentric distance ( r@xmath30 ) .",
    "the data points include those obtained by lara et al .",
    "( 2011b ) , knight and schleicher ( 2013 ) and the lulin and ca results ( this work ) for pre - perihelion and post - perihelion observations during the 2010 apparition are presented here .",
    "we used the linear fitting in the log - log scale to estimate the slope of the r@xmath30 dependence of the gas production rate , q@xmath31 , and the slopes ( @xmath32 ) of cn and c@xmath11 are 4.57 and 4.84 before perihelion and 3.21 and 3.42 after perihelion , respectively .",
    "the corresponding slopes are significantly steeper than the average value estimated for jupiter - family comets , i.e. q(gas)@xmath33 @xcite . additionally to this , the average c@xmath0-to - cn production rate ratio is @xmath34 which places 103p / hartley 2 as being `` typical '' in terms of cometary chemistry defined by ahearn et al ( 1995 ) .",
    "our measurement is consistent with the results from the spectroscopic observations ( lara et al .",
    "2011b ) and the narrow - band photometry observations ( knight and schleicher 2013 ) .",
    "we describe the morphology and evolution of the coma structures that can be treated with routine procedures , i.e. larson - sekanina algorithm ( larson and sekanina 1984 ) . in case of doubt , we used additional techniques , such as azimuthal median profile division and adaptive laplace filter ( bhnhardt and birkle 1994 ) to clearly separate morphological features from artifacts . figure  [ comparison ] compares the jet structure and dust tail feature on october 11 obtained by using three different image enhancement methods : ( a ) the larson - sekanina filtering , ( b ) the azimuthal median profile , and ( c ) the adaptive laplace filtering . in spite of some differences in their appearances ,",
    "the presence of two jets in the sunward quarter is common to all numerical treatments .",
    "it is therefore clear that the jet features are real and not artifacts associated with the image processing procedures .",
    "figure  [ rjet1 ] is a summary of the r - band images enhanced by the larson - sekanina filtering method to bring out the inhomogeneous structures in the dust coma of 103p / hartley 2 .",
    "it can be seen that from april until july , 2010 , no clear sign of dust features could be found . however , beginning in august 1 , a dust tail of diffuse structure ( labeled _ t _ in figure  [ rjet1 ] ) began to appear in the anti - sunward direction . on september 29 , a short jet ( indicated by arrows in figure  [ rjet1 ] ) in the sunward direction can be seen .",
    "hereafter , this sunward jet feature can be detected in all our images obtained at lulin and calar alto observatory .",
    "it is interesting to note that two distinct sunward dust structures are visible after october 29 lasting until november 2 .",
    "around the same time , from november 2 to november 4 , mueller et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also reported seeing two separate continuum features in sunward direction .",
    "afterwards , only a single jet could be seen in the sunward direction that became fainter and fainter as hartley 2 s heliocentric and geocentric distances increased .",
    "the sunward jet features showed relatively little variation during a night but its shape and position angle slightly changed from night to night until october 11 when two distinct jet features apparently emerged from the sunward direction ( figure 5 ) . in order to examine the existence of this extremely faint jet feature and to distinguish it from the trail of a background star ,",
    "we transformed the enhance image into polar coordinates @xmath2-@xmath35 where @xmath2 is the projected cometocentric distance from the nucleus and @xmath35 is the azimuth ( position angle ) . at several distances",
    "@xmath2 from the nucleus , we analyzed the resulting azimuthal profile . in fig .",
    "5 ( right panel ) we show the azimuthal profile at @xmath36 km .",
    "it can be seen that this faint jet ( referred as main feature in the figure ) appears on oct .",
    "11.76 and persists until oct . 11.87 , that is @xmath150.7hr later ( bottom panel in fig . 5 ) .",
    "it points towards the sun and it does not display significant changes . on oct . 11.84 , a new faint feature appears nearly perpendicularly to the sun - comet line .",
    "it is interesting to note that the position angle of the secondary jet is roughly the same as that of the cn jet features shown in figure  [ cnjet ] ( pointing to the east - south direction in the top - middle panel ) . at first",
    ", one could think that icy grains mixed with the dust grains of this weaker jet could provide the partial fuel to the cn gas jet . however , the gas jets persist for most of a rotation period ( knight and schleicher 2011 , samarasinha et al .",
    "2011 ) and are clearly being released over an extended period of time as the nucleus rotates .",
    "thus , the cn jets can not mainly come from this faint jet feature if it is only active for a few hours as found here . that switching phenomenon may also be explained as a projection effect due to the comet nucleus rotation .",
    "+ for oct .",
    "28 and 29 , we obtained a series of images from lulin and calar alto observatories that provide insight into how the sunward feature evolved throughout @xmath151.4 rotation cycles .",
    "representative images from these nights are shown in fig .",
    "6 , with each panel enhanced by the larson - sekanina filtering method .",
    "notice that the position angle ( pa ) of the sun during these two days is near 97@xmath37 . setting the zero phase at 11:40 ut on october 10 and using a period of 18.11 hr ( see the section 3 ) ,",
    "the rotational phase can be easily estimated in these three images ( see the bottom right corner of figure  [ lotca ] ) .",
    "a dust jet ( labeled j and marked with an arrow in figure  [ lotca ] ) can be seen in the sunward direction whose shape slightly changes as the rotational phase change from 0.22 ( on oct .",
    "28.68 ut ) to 0.82 ( oct . 29.13 ut ) .",
    "thirteen hours later , ( rotational phase of 0.57 , oct .",
    "29.70 ut ) two dust jet features emanating in the sunward direction can be seen .",
    "one of them , labeled j1 , is close to the position of sun ( pas @xmath1585@xmath37 ) and the other , labeled j2 , lays at the pas @xmath38 . owing to the similar pas",
    ", we consider the possibility that j1 feature might have the same source region as seen from the previous two images ( oct .",
    "28.68 and oct .",
    "29.13 ) . under this assumption ,",
    "j2 feature is new .",
    "another possibility is j1 feature might be associated with the cometary rotational effect , i.e. local sunrise accompanied by temperature increase turns that jet on .",
    "this localized temperature difference in the regions of waist and the sun - lit end of the nucleus have been addressed by belton et al ( 2013 ) . the j2 feature which has a collimated - like shape is the persistent feature we detected on oct .",
    "28.68 and oct . 29.13 although pa and shape changed between those two dates .",
    "we note that the brightness of j2 feature is higher than that of j1 feature and this higher intensity could be related to the dusty ice , or to an outburst from the surface of the comet nucleus .",
    "to understand their interrelationship better , our images need to be interpreted in the context of a larger image series that displays the time evolution of the jet structure over two or more rotational period .",
    "+ on the tailward side , only the dust tail was readily visible starting in august , 2010 .",
    "dust tail was found to point approximately in the antisolar direction .",
    "as expected , it appears to be curved slightly counterclock - wise .",
    "we used af@xmath2 ( ahearn et al .",
    "1984 ) to characterize the dust activity of the comet , the derived values acquired with broadband r - filter from april to november 2010 are presented in figure  [ afrho ] . except for the night on october 29 ,",
    "the average values estimated every photometric night were all measured within a projected distance of 5,000 km .",
    "notice that af@xmath2 shows a weak dependence on the @xmath2 , projected distance from nucleus , from 5,000 km to 20,000 km and the variation was found to be less than approx .",
    "the reason why we used 5,000 km for uniform radius is to reduce the influence of star trails in field of view .",
    "the @xmath39 values steadily increased with decreasing heliocentric distance , although there was not a noticeable increase when the second jet appeared on oct . 11.64 ut or at the perihelion .",
    "the @xmath39 value on october 29.77 @xmath15 29.85 ut increased from 155 cm to 174 cm in two hours , and at the same time the dust jet seen in figure 6 ( right panel ) was more prominent on this night than on any of the other nights and a relatively weak secondary jet feature was also detected .",
    "possible causes for this deviation might include the changes in the physical properties of the grains as they travel outward ( i.e. loss of volatiles or fragmentation ) , the action of solar radiation pressure modifying the straight trajectories of small particles inside the field of view , or a long - lasting population of large particles ( schleicher et al .",
    "furthermore , the power law index of the @xmath1 dependence for the dust , af@xmath2 ( 5,000 km ) , is @xmath40 before perihelion and is @xmath41 post - perihelion .",
    "this is result is completely consistent with knight and schleicher s ( 2013 ) when using a(@xmath35)f@xmath2 .",
    "+ the derived af@xmath2 values for the narrowband filter can be taken to estimate the color of the cometary dust @xcite as the normalized gradient of the af@xmath2 product between the blue ( bc,@xmath42= 4,430  ) and red ( rc,@xmath42= 6,840  ) continuum filters .",
    "the dust color can be converted to a percentage of reddening per 1,000  and is defined by the following relation :    @xmath43    the summarized results in table  [ tcolor ] indicate that the averaging dust color within the innermost 5,000 km of the coma did not appear to vary significantly with heliocentric distance .",
    "this behavior of the averaging dust color seems to indicate that the innermost coma do not introduce significant changes on the size distribution and/or overall properties of dust grains . as we found a jet feature that switches on and off from our images in figure  [ rjet1 ] to figure  [ lotca ] , we analyzed the entire flux - calibrated images acquired with bc and rc narrowband filters instead of integrating whole flux in the innermost 5,000 km .",
    "the resulting two - dimensional dust color map can be seen in figure  [ fcolor ] ( the third column ) .",
    "figure  [ fcolor ] displays the dust coma of comet 103p / hartley 2 from october 10 to november 2 imaged in bc and rc narrowband filters ( first two column ) , the dust color map ( the third column ) and azimuthal median profile subtracted rc filter images ( the fourth column ) that displays the jet activity in the dust coma .",
    "the data here presented pertaining to october and november give an extremely reddened dust , with a normalized color @xmath15 30 - 45 % , within a radius of @xmath44  km measured from the optocenter of the images .",
    "this red dust could be associated with strong jet activity .",
    "the sunward jet feature might give rise to higher dust abundances at closer cometocentric distances ( i.e. near the optocenter ) .",
    "these dust grains are initially large with a reddening of @xmath45%/1,000 , while travelling out they split up and show bluer at @xmath46 km with a dust reddening of @xmath15 10 - 15 % . in comparison with tailward direction ,",
    "the color variation is 5% to 10% .",
    "the decrease in the dust reddening means that the optical properties of the dust grains change as the dust grains move outward or this blueing of the dust could be also associated with an outburst ( bonev et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for color variation is that the larger dust grains mixed with the icy grains dominate the scattering behavior at close distance around the nucleus . when these larger dust grains move outwards , they break up or sublimate into the small sub - micron particles resulting in a bluer continuum due to their smaller sizes ( lara et al",

    "we observed the comet hartley 2 at the lulin observatory in taiwan , the calar alto observatory in spain , and the beijing astronomical observatory in china , from april to december , 2010 using both broadband and narrowband filters , and long - slit spectrophotometry .",

    "cn morphology : the processed cn images revealed two asymmetric jet features in the coma of comet hartley 2 .",
    "the cn jet features detected in the images here presented did not show the sprial - like structure seen by other authors in earlier date due to different observing geometry .",
