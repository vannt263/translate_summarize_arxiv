    "there has been convincing evidence indicating that our universe is composed of nearly @xmath0 cold dark matter ( dm ) plus a small fraction of baryonic matter and around @xmath1 dark energy ( de)@xcite .",
    "one leading candidate of such a de is the cosmological constant , representing a vacuum energy density with constant equation of state @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is difficult to understand such a cosmological constant in terms of fundamental physics .",
    "its observed value is far below that estimated in quantum field theory , what is referred to as the cosmological constant problem .",
    "moreover , using the cosmological constant to explain the de , there is no natural understanding why the constant vacuum energy and matter energy densities are precisely of the same order today .",
    "this is the so - called coincidence problem .    considering",
    "that de and dm are dominant sources of the content of the universe , it is natural , in the framework of field theory , to consider the inevitable interaction between them @xcite .",
    "an appropriate interaction between de and dm can provide a mechanism to alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a non - minimal coupling in dark sectors can affect significantly the expansion history of the universe and the density perturbation evolution , changing the growth history of cosmological structures .",
    "the possibility that de and dm interact with each other has been widely discussed recently @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a number of studies have been devoted to analyze the constraints on the dark sectors mutual interaction from the probes of the cosmic expansion history by using the wmap , snia , bao and sdss data etc @xcite-@xcite .",
    "interestingly it was disclosed that the late isw effect has the unique ability to provide insight into the coupling between dark sectors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , complementary probes of the coupling within the dark sectors have been carried out in the study of the growth of cosmic structure @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was found that a non - zero interaction between dark sectors leaves a clear change in the growth index @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was suggested that the dynamical equilibrium of collapsed structures such as clusters would acquire a modification due to the coupling between de and dm @xcite . comparing the naive virial masses of a large sample of clusters with their masses estimated by x - ray and by weak lensing data ,",
    "a small positive coupling has been tightly constrained @xcite , which agrees with the results given in @xcite from cmb .",
    "the small positive coupling indicates that there is energy transfer from de to dm , which can help to alleviate the coincidence problem @xcite .    both de and",
    "dm are currently only detected via their gravitational effects and any change in the de density is conventionally attributed to its equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "this status leads to an inevitable degeneracy while extracting the signature of the interaction between dark sectors and other cosmological parameters . in this work",
    ", we will first discuss the degeneracy between the de and dm coupling and the equation of state ( eos ) of de in the background dynamics .",
    "furthermore , we will extend our discussion to the perturbed spacetime by considering the perturbation evolution of de and dm .",
    "we review the formalism of the perturbation theory when there is an interaction between dark sectors . based upon this formalism",
    "we explore the possibility of breaking the degeneracy between the coupling and other cosmological parameters , such as the eos parameter @xmath3 of de as well as the dm abundance .",
    "this can help us extract a tighter constraint on the interaction between dark sectors from observations .",
    "in the spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) background , if there is an interaction between de and dm , neither of them can evolve independently .",
    "the ( non)conservation equations are described by @xmath4 where the subscript ",
    "c \" represents dm and  d \" stands for de .",
    "@xmath5 is the term leading to energy transfer . considering that there is only energy transfer between de and dm",
    ", we have @xmath6 .",
    "the sign of @xmath7 determines the direction of energy transfer . for positive @xmath7 ,",
    "the energy flows from de to dm . for negative @xmath7 ,",
    "the energy flow is reversed . since we know neither the physics of dm nor that of de at the present moment , we can not write out the precise form of the interaction between them from first principles ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "one has to specify the interaction either from the outset @xcite , or determine it from phenomenological requirements @xcite .    for the sake of generality",
    ", we consider the phenomenological description of the interaction between de and dm as a linear combination of energy densities of dark sectors @xmath8 @xcite . in studying the curvature perturbation it has been made clear that when the interaction is proportional to the energy density of de ( @xmath9 ) , we get a stable curvature perturbation ; however , when the interaction is proportional to the dm density ( @xmath10 ) or total dark sectors ( @xmath11 ) , the curvature perturbation can only be stable when the constant de eos satisfies @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "for the case of a time - dependent de eos , the stability of curvature perturbations was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the presence of the coupling also changes the dm and de redshift dependence acting as an extra contribution to their effective equation of state .",
    "indeed , the effective background equations of state for the two fluids are @xmath13 choosing different forms for the interaction , the effective background eos can be read from table i. for convenience , we label our models with roman numbers .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have reviewed the formalism of the perturbation theory when there is an interaction between de and dm .",
    "we have proposed a way to construct the coupling vector in a self consistent manner both in the perturbed form and in the background . based upon the perturbation formalism",
    "we have studied the signature of the interaction between dark sectors from cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "theoretically we found that there are possible ways to break the degeneracy between the interaction , de eos and dm abundance .",
    "this can help to get tight constraint on the interaction between de and dm .",
    "we have performed the global fitting by using the cmb power spectrum data from wmap7y results together with latest snia , bao and @xmath14 data to constrain the interaction between de and dm . when the interaction between de and dm takes the form proportional to the energy density of dm and the total dark sectors , in @xmath15 range the coupling is found to be positive .",
    "the tight positive coupling indicates that there is energy flow from de to dm , which can help us to alleviate the cosmological coincidence problem .",
    "the question of how to improve the model is now much related to find a field theory based model for the interaction and how to relate the model to the standard model of particle interactions .",
    "this is currently under study .",
