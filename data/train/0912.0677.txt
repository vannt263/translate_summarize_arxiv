    "the triumph of modern physics is largely reflected in our ability to understand the properties of the universe and its dynamics from the fundamental physical theories . yet there is a prediction of quantum field theory and string theory which is grossly inconsistent with the existence of the observed universe .",
    "the vacuum energy density calculated in these theories can be so large in absolute value ( @xmath1 , with @xmath2 around the planck mass ) that the universe would either recollapse immediately after the big bang or the formation of galaxies that we observe would be prevented .",
    "this huge gap in our understanding of nature , known as _ the old cosmological constant problem _ , is one of the most important unresolved issues in fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "the cosmological constant ( cc ) receives numerous contributions from zero point energies of quantum fields and phase transitions in the early universe , along with an arbitrary additive constant as allowed by general covariance .",
    "these effects are of very different orders of magnitude , and all of them are many orders of magnitude larger than the value consistent with the observations , @xmath3 .",
    "there is the possibility that these disparate contributions might cancel to produce the observed value @xmath4 , but this would entail an unacceptably large fine - tuning . definitely , we have to find another , more natural , solution .    there have been numerous attempts to solve the old cc problem , e.g.a recent one is  @xcite .",
    "many , if not all of them , and especially those based on dynamical scalar fields , still suffer from severe fine - tuning troubles in one form or another  @xcite .",
    "rather than replacing the cc by scalar fields , one may think of the cc term as an effective quantity @xmath5 evolving with the expansion rate of the universe , @xmath6 .",
    "the approach to a dynamical cc in quantum field theory has been recently re - emphasized in @xcite , and it has proven fruitful in tackling the cosmic coincidence problem@xcite .",
    "maybe it can also be useful to deal with the old cc problem .",
    "thus , instead of looking for the solution in the matter sector , the possibility that it could have a gravitational origin should be seriously investigated .",
    "this might provide a well behaved `` effective cc term '' @xmath7 , viz .",
    "one which is very large in the early universe ( @xmath8 ) but very small at present ( @xmath9 ) . in this letter",
    ", we present action functionals of modified gravity which incorporate a very large @xmath10 and still result in a cosmological expansion with a measurable @xmath7 which is ( very ) close to the dynamics of the benchmark @xmath11cdm cosmological model .",
    "the striking feature of these modified gravity models is that they relax a large cc without fine - tuning . the gravitational mechanism for equilibrating the effects of a large cc we refer to as _ the relaxation mechanism _ whereas the cosmological models in which this mechanism is implemented we call _ the relaxed universe_.",
    "an essential ingredient of the new universe is the feedback between the dynamics of space - time and the functioning of the relaxation mechanism . the very expansion owing to the existence of a large cc sets the relaxation mechanism in motion . the effects of modified gravity equilibrate ( dynamically ) the effects of the large cc .",
    "as a result , a realistic universe with a standard sequence of radiation dominated , matter dominated and accelerating epochs unfolds automatically . the relaxation mechanism based on the component with an inhomogeneous equation of state ( eos )",
    "was introduced in @xcite , while in @xcite it was shown that the inhomogeneous eos is an effective description of modified gravity effects .",
    "the following step was to construct a viable cosmological model .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have proposed a scenario which achieves this goal in a dynamical way , thereby avoiding fine - tuning . in a flat flrw cosmos , we introduced a dynamical vacuum component , which counter - acts the effect of a large @xmath12 .",
    "the total vacuum energy density was found to be @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a constant parameter , and the function @xmath15 representing the heart of the relaxation mechanism will follow shortly . first",
    ", suppose that @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 gev ) as given by the large ( and negative ) vacuum contribution from the higgs potential in the electro - weak phase transition .",
    "without counter - measures , the negative @xmath18 would let the universe quickly collapse into a catastrophic big crunch . to prevent this , one could artificially add a fine - tuned cc counter - term .",
    "our relaxation mechanism , though , will do the job automatically .",
    "let us illustrate it first with a toy model in the radiation era , where the deceleration parameter  @xmath19 is close to but smaller than unity , @xmath20 . in this epoch",
    ", consider @xmath21 and @xmath22 given in terms of  @xmath23 and the hubble rate  @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , the mechanism will stabilize the expansion , because the big @xmath25 wants to rapidly initiate the collapse , thereby pushing the deceleration @xmath23 closer to  @xmath26 .",
    "however , @xmath23 can never reach  @xmath26 because the second term @xmath27>0 $ ] in @xmath5 will become sufficiently large to compensate the negative cc , finally resulting in @xmath28  the cc has been relaxed . and vice versa :",
    "if @xmath29 would dominate over @xmath18 , the value of @xmath23 would move away from @xmath30 towards smaller values due to the large positive vacuum energy . consequently ,",
    "@xmath27 $ ] will decrease and @xmath23 will reach a stable point where @xmath18 and @xmath31 compensate each other . the resulting universe will expand like a radiation cosmos since small changes of @xmath23 around @xmath32 are sufficient to keep both terms of @xmath5 in equilibrium .",
    "to apply the cc relaxation mechanism to the whole big bang expansion history , consider the more sophisticated b - function in @xmath5 above @xmath33 involving only the ricci scalar @xmath34 and the gau - bonnet term @xmath35 , both computed in the flrw metric .",
    "thus , @xmath15 reads explicitly @xmath36^{3}\\,.\\label{eq : b(h , q)}\\ ] ] it is easy to see that the second term , proportional to @xmath37 , will be responsible for the cc relaxation in the radiation regime ( @xmath32 ) , where the hubble rate was large . since , however , @xmath6 decreases with time",
    ", the first term @xmath38 , with a lower power of @xmath6 , will eventually dominate and relax the cc in the matter era , where @xmath39 .",
    "the arguments for the dynamical stabilization in @xmath5 are exactly the same as in the toy model above .",
    "another novelty is the fixed parameter @xmath40 , which is related to the hubble rate @xmath41 at the time of matter - radiation equality , where  @xmath42 is the current value . in the late accelerating universe , @xmath43 and the tiny expansion rate  @xmath44 makes @xmath45 the relevant term . in summary ,",
    "the smallness of the denominator @xmath15 in @xmath5 during all cosmological epochs is the clue to the relaxation mechanism .",
    "an additional physical argument in favor of it is the growth of inhomogeneities , which is in accord with observations @xcite .",
    "this is a good place to demonstrate the absence of fine - tuning in our mechanism .",
    "let us ignore  @xmath46 factors in the friedmann equation @xmath47 at late times . since @xmath18 and the compensating term @xmath48 are much larger than the matter density @xmath49 and the critical energy density  @xmath50 , we find , in very good approximation , @xmath51 at late times .",
    "obviously , small changes in the parameter @xmath14 will induce only small changes in the hubble rate  @xmath6 .",
    "hence , it suffices to fix the order of magnitude of @xmath14 to obtain a small @xmath9 .",
    "this has nothing to do with fine tuning .",
    "for instance , take a typical gut value @xmath1 , with @xmath52 ; then @xmath53 with @xmath54 ev ( of order of a light neutrino mass ) would do .",
    "an essential result thus follows : large @xmath12 guarantees small asymptotic @xmath9 for reasonable @xmath55 .",
    "next we implement the cc relaxation mechanism , here for the first time in the modified gravity setup and in the metric formalism @xcite .",
    "the crucial part of the model is a function @xmath0 of the ricci scalar @xmath56 and the gau - bonnet invariant  @xmath57 .",
    "the complete action functional of our cosmological model is the following : @xmath58,\\label{eq : cc - relax - action}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the matter lagrangian , and @xmath18 an arbitrarily large cosmological constant .",
    "@xmath60 is the newton constant and the parameter  @xmath14 will also be dimensionful in general .",
    "the variational principle @xmath61 then leads straightforwardly to the einstein equations , @xmath62,\\label{eq : mod - einstein - eqs}\\ ] ] involving the einstein tensor  @xmath63 and the energy - momentum tensor  @xmath64 of matter .",
    "additionally , there is a new tensor @xmath65 coming solely from the @xmath0 term in the action  ( [ eq : cc - relax - action ] ) . on a spatially flat flrw background with line element @xmath66 and scale factor  @xmath67 , the tensor components in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mod - einstein - eqs ] ) are given by @xmath68 , @xmath69 and@xmath70,\\label{eq : e00}\\\\ e_{\\,\\ , j}^{i } & = & \\delta_{\\,\\ , j}^{i}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}f(r,{{\\mathcal g}})-(\\dot{h}+3h^{2})f^{r}+2h\\dot{f}^{r}+\\ddot{f}^{r}\\right.\\nonumber \\\\   & + & ( \\dot{h}+h^{2})(8h\\dot{f}^{{{\\mathcal g}}}-12h^{2}f^{{{\\mathcal g}}})+4h^{2}\\ddot{f}^{{{\\mathcal g}}}\\biggr],\\label{eq : eij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are partial derivatives of @xmath73 with respect to  @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , and @xmath74 .",
    "the matter sector is described by the standard energy - momentum tensor of an ideal fluid , with proper energy density  @xmath75 and pressure @xmath76 ( summed repeated indices ) .",
    "similarly , the @xmath0-functional induces the effective energy density and pressure @xmath77 since  @xmath78 and  @xmath65 are covariantly conserved , @xmath64 is conserved , too .",
    "therefore , the bianchi identity on the flrw background , @xmath79 , is valid for both matter ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath73-components ( @xmath81 , and hence also for ( @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the total energy density of the effective vacuum sector and @xmath84 denotes the corresponding pressure .",
    "the generalized friedmann - lematre equations read : @xmath85 they contain the energy densities of pressureless matter @xmath86 and radiation  @xmath87 with pressure  @xmath88 , and the effective vacuum components .    motivated by the toy - model discussion above , the function @xmath73 in our setup is taken in the simple form @xmath89 , with @xmath15 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b(r , g ) ] ) .",
    "the key to the relaxation mechanism in this functional framework is the observation that every derivative of @xmath73 in the expressions ( [ eq : e00 ] ) and ( [ eq : eij ] ) yields another factor @xmath90 .",
    "thus the induced quantities @xmath91 and @xmath92 adopt , in general , the structure @xmath93 where @xmath94 are functions not proportional to  @xmath15 . correspondingly , the effective vacuum energy density adopts the form @xmath95 and , in complete analogy with the toy - model discussion , it can be small because the large @xmath18 can be dynamically compensated by letting @xmath15 become sufficiently small ( but non - zero ) , i.e.  @xmath96  hereafter referred to as `` relaxation condition '' .",
    "note that , at the equilibrium point ( e.g.  @xmath32 in the radiation era ) , both terms in @xmath5 are almost equal to each other , apart from opposite signs .",
    "therefore , @xmath91 behaves approximately as another ( large ) cosmological constant . obviously , @xmath5 is not constant in general , because @xmath97 is time - dependent .",
    "in addition , there is a corresponding compensation of the pressure terms @xmath92 and @xmath98 in @xmath99 .",
    "finally , since the functions ( [ eq : e00 ] ) and ( [ eq : eij ] ) differ from each other , the effective eos , @xmath100 , will be in general a non - trivial function of time or redshift .",
    "this should have phenomenological implications .",
    "in the following , we will describe approximately the cosmic evolution by making use of the cc relaxation condition , which is equivalent to @xmath28 . remember that @xmath15 never vanishes .",
    "our analysis will be supported by exact numerical results ( cf .",

    "( [ eq : rho - pres_f ] ) .",

    "( [ eq : einstein - q-1 - 2 ] ) renders @xmath104 whereupon @xmath105 , with @xmath106 a constant ; and then via the bianchi identity for ( @xmath107 we find @xmath108 , the effective vacuum energy density , with @xmath109 another constant .",
    "thence @xmath110 is the corresponding eos , which interpolates between dust matter ( @xmath111 ) at late times and radiation ( @xmath112 ) in the early matter era .",
    "depending on the integration constant @xmath109 a pole might occur in @xmath113 when @xmath5 changes its sign , see fig .",
    "[ fig : model-1overb ] .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath5 behaves like dark matter in this epoch , and we could speculate on incorporating both dark matter and dark energy into @xmath5 . apart from that , we remark the approximate tracking relation @xmath114 , which can be considered a cornerstone for solving the coincidence problem .",
    "we expect that the relaxation mechanism became active only as of the early radiation era , because @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cc - relax - action ] ) was sub - dominant during the preceding periods of inflation and reheating , where @xmath23 was far from @xmath26 . however , deep in the radiation epoch , before the matter era , we find @xmath30 and @xmath73 becomes very important",
    ". then @xmath116 implies @xmath117 upon using the relaxation condition in eq .",

    ". moreover , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : einstein - h2 ] ) and ( [ eq : einstein - q-1 - 2 ] ) lead to the relation @xmath118\\propto a^{-{8}/{3}}\\,,\\label{eq : rd - friedmann}\\ ] ] and thus to @xmath119 , for constant @xmath120 . from here",
    "the bianchi identity determines @xmath121 , with a new a constant @xmath122 .",

    "[ fig : model-1overb ] ) can appear depending on @xmath122 .",
    "as in the case of the matter epoch , it entails no physical singularity since all the energy densities remain finite ; it merely reflects the change of sign of @xmath5 .",
    "remarkably enough , we encounter the tracking property  @xmath124 also in the radiation era .    at late times",
    ", the universe leaves the matter epoch ( @xmath125 ) and gradually enters the `` dark energy ( de ) era '' . as @xmath23 departs now significantly from  @xmath126 or @xmath26 , the last dynamical resource left to the relaxation mechanism for compensating the big @xmath127 , is to choose a very low value of @xmath6 , whereby the de epoch takes over somewhere near our time ( cf.fig .",

[ fig : model-1overb ] .",
    "there are actually three solutions for @xmath133 : a phantom phase , a de sitter phase with constant @xmath6 and an asymptotic power - law expansion @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "the previously found solution is of this sort , with @xmath136 .",
    "it is not difficult to work out generalized relaxation models , e.g.of the form @xmath137 with @xmath138 .",
    "the crucial ingredient is the function @xmath15 in the denominator of @xmath73 . generally , this yields induced terms @xmath139 with @xmath140 as a result of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e00],[eq : eij ] ) , where derivatives of @xmath73 introduce more factors of @xmath15 in the denominators .",
    "one can readily show that the cc relaxation and tracking properties in the matter and radiation eras follow again from the relaxation condition .",
    "furthermore , the parameter  @xmath14 is related to a power of a mass scale @xmath55 as  @xmath141 .",
    "the size of @xmath55 can be estimated by applying the approximations @xmath142 , @xmath143 $ ] , together with the condition @xmath144 for the standard gut energy density ( @xmath52 ) . in the case",

    "similarly , we obtain @xmath148 mev@xmath149 , for @xmath150 ; and @xmath151 , for @xmath152 .",
    "remarkably , the mass parameter  @xmath55 of the relaxation mechanism is not only completely free from fine - tuning problems , it also lies in a perfectly reasonable range of particle physics masses , possibly related to neutrinos , qcd or even gut models .",
    "to summarize , in this letter , we have unveiled a whole class of modified gravity action models which , despite holding an arbitrarily large cc at _ all _ times since the early epochs , display a very small `` effective cc '' at present , and without ever needing fine tuning .",
    "like many modified gravity models our approach is not complete because of the existence of extra degrees of freedom and related problems , which require further considerations , see e.g.  @xcite . nevertheless , the _ relaxed universe _ scenario is _ not _ just another example for inducing late time cosmic acceleration , for the gravity modifications needed to dynamically compensate the large cc are crucial during the entire cosmic history .",
    "the mechanism also predicts remarkable tracking properties , and characteristic dynamical features in our recent past , which alleviate the coincidence problem . a more detailed account of this framework will be presented elsewhere .    *",
