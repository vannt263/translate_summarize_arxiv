    "the recent interest in nuclei beyond the proton drip line , prompted the study of proton emission phenomenon from the ground state of such nuclei @xcite .",
    "like in the case of @xmath7 decay , this process consists in the tunneling of the proton across a potential barrier .",
    "however for this kind of radioactivity it is vital to add the centrifugal potential to the coulomb barrier since the majority of emitted protons are likely to decay from states with @xmath8 .    in last years a series of theoretical investigations , based on the quasi - classical approximation",
    "have been carried out in this field @xcite .",
    "the proton half - lives of observed heavy proton emitters were calculated and compared with the experimental ones and in some cases a good agreement was found .    in the gamow approach",
    "the decay is treated as a stationary process , the penetrability being given by the ratio of probabilities of finding the quantum particle on each side of the potential barrier . in this image",
    "the dynamical aspects are neglected .",
    "however quantities like the tunneling time are important in decay processes , in fission or in fusion reactions . in order to include the time evolution of a wave packet propagating in a classically forbidden region one need to solve the time dependent schr \" odinger equation ( tdse ) .",
    "there have been some attempts to incorporate the time - dependency in the study of the proton decay @xcite by expanding the wave function into a term describing the bound - state of the prepared nucleus @xmath9 and a set of exit channel wave functions @xmath10 orthogonal to it which decomposed into the intrinsic states of the daughter nucleus @xmath11 and of the proton @xmath12 . however , imposing that the decay width is smaller than the resonance ( quasi - stationary ) energy ( @xmath13 ) the treatment reduce to the stationary schr \" odinger equation for @xmath14 with a complex energy @xmath15 .",
    "afterwards the usual computational procedure is carried on @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "based on a previous application of tdse to the study of @xmath7 decay @xcite , we address the question of proton - decay from orbitals with @xmath8 for the spherical nucleus @xmath0pb .",
    "this process is different from the ground - state proton emission beyond the proton drip line .",
    "however the theoretical techniques that we employ in this paper can be applied in both cases without major changes . in our time - dependent approach the description of the decaying system is fully contained in the state vector .",
    "the time evolution of this vector enables us to determine the decay probability at any moment @xmath16 .",
    "we are interested to study the influence of the potential on the tunneling quantities and to determine to what extent the errors of the wkb method depends on the energy of the quasi - stationary state and on the angular momentum .",
    "the interaction between the proton and the daughter nucleus @xmath17tl is described by an average woods - saxon ( ws ) field which accounts for the nuclear potential @xmath18 a coulomb potential , which is approximated by the interaction between the point proton and the uniformly charged spherical core of charge @xmath19",
    "@xmath20   ,   r\\le r_{0}^c    \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\frac{(z-1)e^2}{r } , \\hskip 4.65 cm r\\ge r_{0}^c   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the centrifugal barrier @xmath21 the ws interaction is defined by the nuclear radius @xmath22 , with @xmath23= 1.25 fm , the diffuseness @xmath24=0.7 fm , and the depth of the central potential @xmath25= 58 mev @xcite .",
    "note that in other papers , the depth of the potential is not fixed , its value being adjusted to reproduce the experimental energy of the quasi - bound state @xcite . the coulomb radius is given by @xmath26 .",
    "the initial wave function of the proton was chosen to correspond to a quasi - stationary state of the potential @xmath27 , with positive energy @xmath28 .",
    "the decay width of such a metastable state can be calculated using an analytic method developed by gurwitz et al .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    "it is assumed that the proton occupies a bound eigenstate in the potential well @xmath29 which represents a slight modification of @xmath30 .",
    "therefore we take @xmath31 where , @xmath32 is an eigenstate of energy @xmath33 corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the reduced mass of the daughter - proton system .",
    "the modification @xmath36 reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 gives the slope of the potential barrier beyond the point @xmath39 at which @xmath30 attain its maximum .    in what follows we shall consider only the wave functions @xmath40 with the highest eigenvalue @xmath33 bellow the barrier @xmath41 .",
    "in table i we list the heights of the barriers @xmath42 , their locations @xmath43 and the selected eigenvalues @xmath44 for a given value of the angular momentum @xmath1 .",
    "the next step consists in the resolution of the time dependent schrdinger equation : @xmath45 where @xmath46 a numerical procedure based on the iterated leap - frog method , provides the solution of this equation @xcite .",
    "the equidistant spatial grid used in this method is large enough such that no interference of the outgoing and ingoing wave functions will take place during the time intervals employed in the calculations .",
    "once we get the wave - function which describes the time evolution of the proton packet through the potential barrier we are able to compute relevant quantities of the decay process .    the tunneling probability can be expressed as the probability of finding the proton beyond a certain point @xmath47 on the border which separates the zone inside the barrier from the external one @xmath48 the decay rate is calculated according to the relation @xmath49    it is also interesting to calculate the average value of the proton wave packet position operator , @xmath50 , inside the nucleus @xmath51",
    "in figure 1 a , b we present the time evolution of the proton wave function @xmath52 for two angular momenta @xmath53 at four different moments .",
    "we see the tendency of the wave function to decrease its amplitude in the interior of the barrier when time goes on .",
    "eventually we observe that the fraction of the wave function which passed across the barrier behaves like a spreaded wave packet ( at least on the spatial interval that we considered , i.e. up to 60 fm ) .",
    "this tendency is more pronounced for the wave function with @xmath1=5 , because it faces a thiner barrier ( see table 2 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that although the wave function amplitude decreases constantly in time its shape does not change to much inside the barrier .    in figures 2 a",
    ", b the time - dependent decay rate @xmath54 is ploted for angular momentum @xmath1 = 0 , 2 , 5 and 8 .",
    "as has been pointed in an earlier work @xcite the decay rate undergoes two regimes . in the first one , @xmath54 oscillates but increases on the average . the fact that at small times the decay rate is not constant as characteristic for exponential decay , but varies with time is typical for a quantum mechanical description @xcite .",
    "this fact contrasts to the usual classical image which portrays the radioactive system as an ensamble of nuclei decaying independently one of each other with a probability which does not depend on time . in the second regime",
    "@xmath54 performs small fluctuations around a constant value , that we call asymptotic value @xmath55 .",
    "the decay rates presented in figure 2 a correspond to @xmath56 fm , i.e. the inferior limit of integration is choosed to lay between the two turning points as can be observed from table 2 . if @xmath57 is increased , the irregularities occuring in the first regime are smoothed out .",
    "this fact is pictured in figure 2 b , where @xmath47 is choosed to be 25 fm .    in figure 3",
    "we represented the behaviour of the wave packet s average position inside a potential region defined by @xmath58 fm .",
    "as in the case of the decay rate we deal with two regimes . whereas in the first regime @xmath50 increases up to a certain limit , in the second one it performs small - amplitude fluctuations around this limiting value as we expected since , according to a previous remark , the wave function does not change to much its shape .",
    "the period of oscillations in this second regime is denoted by @xmath3 and its value can be deduced simply by measuring the distance between two maxima of @xmath50 ( right column in fig.3 ) .",
    "as has been noted in previous papers @xcite , the quasi - stationary state tends to penetrate the potential barrier by performing these small - amplitude oscillations instead of simply crossing the barrier from one side to the other .",
    "for this reason it makes sense to associate the frequency of collisions in the formula of gamow with @xmath59 instead of @xmath60 , which is defined by the quasi - classical expression ( see eq.(13 ) bellow ) .    in the wkb approximation",
    "the decay rate @xmath61 is constant , its value resulting from the product of the barrier penetrability @xmath62 and the collision frequency @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath63 is given by the inverse of the classical period of motion @xmath65 the wave number @xmath66 reading @xmath67^{1/2}\\ ] ] and the penetrability @xmath68    the stationary states computed in the modified potential , become quasi - stationary when we turn on the real potential ( without the modification @xmath69 ) and their energy is no longer well defined .",
    "therefore , in all the above formulas the decay energy @xmath70 was taken to be the energy of the quasi - stationary state @xmath71 , computed as the average energy of the time dependent scr \" odinger equation @xmath72    in what concerns the decay rate , it can be inferred from table 2 that the decay rates calculated in the time dependent approach @xmath54 are in relatively good agreement with the wkb values @xmath73 especially when the quasi - stationary energy decreases with respect to the barrier height .",
    "except the last case , with the highest angular momentum , in all other cases the wkb results overestimates the time - dependent values .",
    "the comparison between the times @xmath3 and @xmath74 ( see table 2 ) shows that they have very close values .",
    "however they are refering to different types of motion , the first describing the small oscillations of the proton wave function between the walls of the barrier during tunneling , the second , the classical movement inside the potential well .    the transient time is defined as the time interval between the moment when @xmath54 starts to increase up to the moment when it reaches the limiting value @xmath55 .",
    "it depends on the energy of the quasi - stationary state .",
    "its value can be deduced by inspecting figures 2 a and b. the tunneling time is related to the shift in time of the transition point between the two above mentioned regimes , for the decay rate .",
    "therefore it can be associated to the time necessary for the wave function to cross the barrier .",
    "computing the decay rate for two different values of @xmath47 , i.e. the barrier s turning points , and measuring the time delay between the two maxima of the two curves one gets the tunneling time ( see fig.4 a and b ) .",
    "notice that for @xmath75 the tunneling time decreases with increasing @xmath55 .",
    "however this does not happens for the state with higher angular momentum @xmath76 , where , although the decay rate is smaller , the tunneling seems to take place faster .",
    "in fact the tunneling time is correlated with the imaginary time , which is nothing else than the time necessary for the proton packet to cross the inverse potential , i.e. @xmath77",
    "motivated by recent theoretical and experimental investigations on proton radioactivity phenomenon , we studied the time dependent characteristics of the proton tunneling from excited states in the spherical nucleus @xmath0pb .",
    "although this process is different from the ground - state proton emission beyond the proton drip line , the approach employed in this paper could be easily extended to the above mentioned case of proton radioactivity .    since",
    "other theoretical approaches are based on the semiclassical approximation we were interested to compare our exact results with the wkb ones .",
    "we found that the discrepancy between the two methods decreases when the difference between the top of the barrier and the energy of the quasi - stationary state increases .",
    "our study does not concern a certain angular momentum state which could be measured in the decay reaction @xmath0pb@xmath78@xmath79tl @xmath80 . rather for a fixed set of woods - saxon parameters we investigated the dependence of the proton tunneling on time choosing one quasi - stationary state for every angular momentum .",
    "it seems that the accuracy of the wkb approximation increases with @xmath1 . for a comparison with the experiment one should fit some of the ws parameters , e.g. the potential depth , in such a way to reproduce the observed energy .",
    "however the present comparison between the wkb and the time - dependent approaches gives an idea of the error involved in the stationary approach and provides a good starting point for future investigations of proton decay using tdse which could eventually answer to some questions related to this phenomenon .",
