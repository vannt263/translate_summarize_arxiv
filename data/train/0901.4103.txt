    "the band theory of electrons predicts that any crystal with an odd number of electrons per unit cell must be a metal .",
    "however , strong electron - electron interactions can invalidate this conclusion , and such crystals can also be insulators , known as mott insulators .",
    "i will use this term here more broadly : often the mott insulator has a secondary instability to spin or charge ordering which increases the size of the unit cell , so that the ultimate ground state of the insulator does have an even number of electrons per unit cell ( many examples of such instabilities will be discussed below ) .",
    "i will continue to refer to such insulators as mott insulators because electron - electron interactions are crucial to understanding their broken symmetries and excitation spectrum .",
    "in contrast , describing the ordering by using the instabilities of a metallic state with an odd number of electrons per unit cell leads to a rather poor understanding of the insulator and of the energy scales characterizing its excitations .",
    "a canonical model used to study mott insulators is the single - band hubbard model @xmath0 where @xmath1 annihilates an electron with spin @xmath2 on the sites , @xmath3 , of a regular lattice , and @xmath4 is the number operators for these electrons . for small @xmath5 ,",
    "the ground state of @xmath6 is a metal ( on most lattices ) which can be described in the traditional framework of band and fermi liquid theory . for strong repulsion between the electrons with @xmath7 , and with the chemical potential @xmath8 adjusted so that there is one electron per unit cell , charge fluctuations are strongly suppressed on each site , and the ground state is a mott insulator .",
    "the low energy excitations of the mott insulator are described by an effective hamiltonian which is projected onto the subspace of states with exactly one electron per site .",
    "these states are described by the spin orientation of each electron , and the effective hamiltonian is a heisenberg quantum spin model @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction , @xmath11 is the spin @xmath12 operator on site @xmath3 , and the ellipses refer to multiple spin - exchange terms which are generated at higher orders in the expansion in @xmath13 .",
    "one of the purposes of this article is to survey theoretical advances in understanding the ground states of @xmath14 on a variety of lattices in two spatial dimensions .",
    "a number of experimental realizations ( some newly discovered ) will also be surveyed and critically compared with theory .    more broadly , the study of models like @xmath6 and @xmath14 will lead us to a number of exotic phases , both insulating and conducting , which require modern concepts from gauge theory and ` topological ' order for their complete characterization .",
    "our unifying strategy here will be to access these exotic states across a quantum phase transition from a conventional state .",
    "we will begin by characterizing the ` order ' in a conventional state , and then turn up the strength of quantum fluctuations leading to a quantum ` disordering ' transition to an exotic state .",

    "we begin with the fermi liquid state of @xmath6 , characterized by a fermi surface ( in some cases , fermi points ) of charge @xmath15 , spin @xmath12 quasiparticles .",
    "now we postulate a continuous mott transition to an insulator in which the spin and charge of the quasiparticles separate , and a ` ghost ' fermi surface survives in the insulator , with the fermi surface excitations carrying @xmath12 spin , but no charge ; these are fermionic spinons .",

    "+ ( _ iii _ ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : ffl ] , the heavy fermion state of rare - earth intermetallics is described by the kondo - heisenberg model describing the exchange coupling of local moments to itinerant conducting electrons .",
    "the kondo effect tightly entangles the local spins and the itinerant electrons , leading to a ` large fermi surface ' state , which encloses a volume determined by the total electron density , including both the local and itinerant electrons . for sufficiently strong exchange between the spins , the kondo screening can break down , and the local moments and itinerant electrons disentangle , leading to a ` fractionalized fermi liquid ' . in the simplest models , the itinerant electrons form a small , metallic fermi surface of conventional electronic quasiparticles , while the local moments form a spinon fermi surface .",

    "we begin with a metallic fermi liquid state , in the presence of spin density wave order .",
    "this order will generally break up the fermi surface into electron and hole pockets .",

    "@xcite more importantly , there is an upturn in the susceptibility at @xmath195 k which has been ascribed to the dm interactions.@xcite    many of the above experiments indicate that analyses @xcite of the effect of dm interactions on non - magnetic ground states of the heisenberg hamiltonian are needed for a complete understanding of the kagome antiferromagnet . for their dirac algebraic spin liquid , hermele _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the dm coupling was a relevant perturbation , implying that an infinitesimal coupling induced magnetic order . in a recent exact diagonalization study , cepas _ et al .",
