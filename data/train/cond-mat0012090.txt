    "many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) , particularly in hedin s @xmath0 approximation @xcite , has been used extensively to calculate quasiparticle ( qp ) energies and spectra of a wide variety of electron systems @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 method offers a simple way to determine the one - electron green s function , @xmath1 , from which the qp properties can be easily extracted .",
    "however , @xmath1 also contains information about ground - state properties : the expectation value of any one - particle operator can be expressed in terms of @xmath1 , and by using the galitskii - migdal formula @xcite the total energy may also be obtained .",
    "nonetheless , the capability of a green s function mbpt to provide reliable ground - state energies has not been fully explored so far .",
    "the few available results are restricted to the spin - unpolarized homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) in the range of metallic densities ( i.e. , @xmath2 a.u . ) @xcite .",
    "these investigations suggest that the @xmath0 approach could produce accurate electron total energies , but a deeper study is needed to provide an overall assessment of this issue .",
    "this is an important question because many of the limitations of the usual implementations of density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , can be circumvented by using mbpt total - energy calculations . indeed , well - recognized failures of the dft in its usual approximations ( for instance when studying van der waals forces @xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , defects in semiconductors @xcite , or quasi - two dimensional systems @xcite ) are mainly due to the limited account of non - local effects that , on the contrary , are included in the @xmath0 approximation . on the other hand ,",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods are being applied to more and more systems @xcite , but they require a large computational effort . in this context , mbpt has to be regarded as a good candidate to supersede standard dft schemes [ like the local density ( lda ) and the generalized gradient approximations ] without implying a prohibitive computational task . to provide insights into the above points , in this paper we present @xmath0 results for the ground - state properties of the three - dimensional heg ( covering a broad range of densities in both spin - unpolarized and fully spin - polarized phases ) and of the two - dimensional heg . to do",
    "so we have used the _ space - time _ numerical procedure developed by rojas _",
    "this method permits efficient and stable computation of the full self - energy operator @xmath3 and the corresponding green s function @xmath1 @xcite , with the precision needed for a converged evaluation of the total energy .",
    "in mbpt , the green s function and the self - energy of a system of @xmath4 electrons under a external potential @xmath5 are linked through the dyson equation @xmath6 \\ ; ,   \\label{1}\\ ] ] where the usual matrix operations are implied .",
    "@xmath7 is the green s function of a fictitious system of @xmath4 non - interacting electrons under the potential @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( @xmath10 being the exact hartree potential ) , and @xmath11 is a constant that aligns the chemical potential of the fictitious system with the actual one , @xmath12.@xcite . in the @xmath0 framework , @xmath3 is approximated by @xmath13 where the labels 1,2 symbolize space - time coordinates .",
    "@xmath14 is the screened coulomb potential which is related to the bare coulomb interaction @xmath15 and the polarizability @xmath16 by @xmath17 finally , under the @xmath0 approach we have @xcite @xmath18 eq . [ 1]-[4 ] may be solved iteratively to self - consistency .",
    "we note that the choice of the fictitious non - interacting system in ( [ 1 ] ) is arbitrary because the differences arising from different @xmath19s are cancelled out by the terms @xmath20 and @xmath11 .",
    "also , by including the shift @xmath11 we guarantee that at any step of the iteration , @xmath1 verifies several exact properties that have to be verified by any realistic green s function @xcite , ensuring a smooth and stable convergence of the iterative process . furthermore",
    ", the hartree potential has to be updated after each iteration , and this is done by calculating the electron density @xmath21 from @xmath1 . to evaluate @xmath11 we need to obtain the chemical potential that is , by definition , the energy of the highest occupied qp energy , calculated at each iteration in terms of the self - energy by solving the qp schrdinger equation .",
    "the above set of equations defines a _ conserving approximation _ in the baym - kadanoff sense @xcite .",
    "one consequence is that the total number of particles given by the self - consistent @xmath0 green s function does not change when an external perturbation acts on the system .",
    "besides , it gives the right number of particles for the heg @xcite .",
    "the correctness of the number of particles for an arbitrary inhomogeneous system can thus be inferred by regarding the system as the result of an adiabatic transform of the heg .",
    "another characteristic of a conserving approximation is the absence of ambiguities among different expressions for calculating the total energy .",
    "this suggests that a mbpt evaluation of ground - state properties should employ a conserving approximation such as self - consistent @xmath0 .",
    "however , routine @xmath0 calculations are mainly concerned with the qp properties of real materials and do not attempt self - consistency .",
    "indeed , self - consistency implies a worsening in the description of the qp spectrum rather than an improvement @xcite .",
    "hence , the usual non self - consistent ( and non - conserving ) @xmath0 approach ( that we shall denoted as @xmath22 , whereas @xmath0 will stand for the fully self - consistent solution of hedin s equations ) is clearly preferred in a spectral context .",
    "this failing of @xmath0 can be understood in terms of the spectral properties of @xmath23 , but our present interest is very different : issues as those described in the previous paragraph are by far more important than the concrete shape of @xmath1 .",
    "of course these two aspects are not independent , but the development and application of a conserving theory giving at the same time an accurate description of qp spectra is an unsolved formidable challenge .    in @xmath22 ,",
    "the self - energy is approximated by eq . [ 2 ] supposing that @xmath24 , whereas the screened coulomb potential was obtained from ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) once ( i.e. , @xmath14 has been calculated in a rpa fashion ) .",
    "eventually , the dyson equation is solved taking into account that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the lda exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential .",
    "although the term @xmath27 is often neglected at this stage , in this paper we will keep this contribution for the reasons explained above . partial self - consistency ( denoted as @xmath28 ) may be achieved by keeping the screened coulomb potential @xmath29 obtained from a @xmath22 procedure and , hence , by solving only ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) iteratively @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath28 is not a conserving approximation , it gives the right number of particles for the heg ( so meeting an important physical point of the @xmath0 scheme ) @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", its description of qp properties seems to be only marginally worse than @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "finally , there are many other schemes for implementation of the @xmath0 equations , but essentially they are focused on the choice of @xmath30 for non self - consistent calculations , and so are meaningless in an homogeneous system .    as mentioned above",
    ", we will apply the space - time method @xcite to solve the @xmath0 equations .",
    "each one is written in the most favorable spatial representation ( reciprocal or real ) , going from one to other using fourier transforms .",
    "however the most important issue is the evaluation of the dynamical dependence on imaginary time or frequency domain . to calculate ground - state properties ,",
    "a contour deformation avoids the need to obtain @xmath23 for real frequencies .",
    "concretely , the expectation value of any one - particle operator @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 , \\label{5}\\ ] ] where the frequency is measured from the chemical potential @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the integral path in the complex frequency plane equal to the circular arc @xmath35 from @xmath36 to @xmath37 together with the negative imaginary axis .",
    "in the same notation , the galitskii - migdal formula for the total energy reads @xmath38 ,   \\label{6}\\ ] ] @xmath39 being the one - electron hamiltonian with potential @xmath40 . to deal with the evaluation of ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) we write the green s function as @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the solution of the dyson s equation ( [ 1 ] ) , but substituting the full self - energy @xmath43 by its frequency - independent part @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the frequency integrals can be split up in two parts .",
    "the contribution due to @xmath45 is evaluated analytically , whereas for the remainder the only non - zero contribution arises from the imaginary axis , which is amenable for numerical calculation .",
    "we have used gauss - legendre ( gl ) grids for imaginary times and frequencies , and the contributions due to points outside the gl grids are treated in an analytical fashion in accordance with the overall numerical procedure given in ref .",
    "usually , gl grids with 128 points suffice for well - converged results ( better than 1 mha ) . for the heg ,",
    "matrix inversions are not needed , and a fully self - consistent resolution of the @xmath0 equations only takes typically a few seconds on a standard workstation .",
    "using different @xmath0 schemes , we have obtained the xc energy per particle , @xmath46 ( defined as the difference between the energies of the interacting and non - interacting systems ) for the spin - unpolarized ( @xmath47 ) heg ( table [ tab1 ] and fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we first compare our numerical results with the two of von barth and holm @xcite .",
    "a small discrepancy ( @xmath48 mha ) appears , but it is consistent with the error bar ( about 3% ) of the semi - analytical procedure carried out by these authors @xcite .",
    "focusing on the accuracy of the mbpt procedure , we can see that the agreement between the essentially exact diffusion monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite and the self - consistent @xmath0 is almost perfect in the limit of high densities .",
    "this is not a surprise because the exchange is treated exactly by the @xmath0 and it is dominant in this range of densities .",
    "however , the quality of the @xmath0 energies is striking for intermediate and low densities , where the many - body effects not included in the @xmath0 framework might be expected to be evident . partial self - consistency ( @xmath28 ) yields slightly inferior results , though the differences are no more than a few mha .",
    "the worst results ( but , in any case , with errors no greater than 10 mha for metallic densities ) are provided by the non - self - consistent @xmath22 procedure .",
    "@xmath22 underestimates the total energy , and by achieving partial self - consistency , the spectral weight in the green s function is blue - shifted , so increasing the total energy . after full self - consistency ,",
    "such shift is slightly larger , but the kinetic energy is smaller than in @xmath49 .",
    "the presence of these two opposite trends explains the small differences between @xmath0 and @xmath28 .",
    "we have also included ( for comparison ) the corresponding rpa values @xcite .",
    "note that the rpa dielectric function is the same than the @xmath22 one , and the huge discrepancies between them arise from the different ways in which the evaluation of the total energy is performed .",
    "all the above trends also apply for the fully spin - polarized ( @xmath50 ) heg ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , but in this case the errors in the @xmath0 energies are marginally greater .",
    "( although not at all the objective of this paper , it is interesting to note that using the self - consistent @xmath0 , the paramagnetic phase is more stable than the ferromagnetic one up to @xmath51 , in fair agreement with the qmc value @xcite of @xmath52 , despite the low density of the system ) .    our results for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) heg are also shown . in 2d systems ,",
    "correlation effects are much more important ; in other words , the diagrams that are neglected in the @xmath0 scheme play a relevant role in these low - dimensional problems . as a consequence we can not expect here extremely accurate results using the @xmath0 approximation . however , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the @xmath0 gives energies near the qmc values @xcite , resolving partially the inaccuracy of the @xmath22 approach and greatly improving the rpa energies .",
    "we note that in the limit of low densities , @xmath49 fits the qmc results slightly better than @xmath0 .",
    "finally , it is now very well known that @xmath22 does not give the right number of particles for an inhomogeneous system @xcite .",
    "however there were certain doubts whether it recovers the right density of the heg or not .",
    "the use of the space - time method allows us to affirm that @xmath53 does not give exactly the number of particles also in the homogeneous limit .",
    "whereas the exact density and the @xmath22 one are indistinguishable up to @xmath54 , for @xmath55 the @xmath22 overestimates the density by 0.3% .",
    "the deviation increases when going into the low density region , being 1.7% for @xmath56 , and 6.1% for @xmath57 .    in summary ,",
    "we have studied the performance of the @xmath0 approximation for the evaluation of ground - state properties .",
    "the accuracy of the results is correlated with the fulfillment of conservation rules ( that can be achieved by using a self - consistent @xmath0 scheme ) , and the approximations inherent in the @xmath0 scheme have much less importance than when calculating qp properties .",
    "the dynamical dependences in the @xmath0 equations are easy to handle using a representation in imaginary time and frequency , that may be straightforwardly generalized to arbitrary inhomogeneous systems .",
    "hence , the results presented here can be the point of departure for future accurate evaluations of ground - state properties of electron systems without the limitations of dft and the complexity of qmc .",
