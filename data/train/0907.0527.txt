    "a key prediction of the so - called slow - roll inflationary models is that they can not generate detectable non - gaussianity of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations within the accuracy of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap).@xcite there are , however , a number of inflationary models that predict non - gaussianity at a level detectable by the wmap experiment ( see the reviews refs .  ) .",
    "thus , non - gaussianity in the cmb data may be potentially important to discriminate classes of inflationary models .",
    "the wmap team have found that the cmb data are consistent with gaussianity  @xcite however , a number of recent analyses of cmb data performed with different statistical estimators have provided indications of deviations from gaussianity in the cmb temperature fluctuations ( for a list of references see , for example , ref . and references therein ) . on the other hand",
    ", one does not expect that a single statistical estimator can be sensitive to all possible forms of non - gaussianity that may be present in wmap data .",
    "thus , it is important to employ alternative indicators in order to shed light on the possible causes for the reported non - gaussianity of cmb data .",
    "recently we proposed two new non - gaussianity indicators , based on skewness and kurtosis of large - angle patches of cmb maps , which provide a directional measure of deviation from gaussianity on large angular scales.@xcite a distinctive feature of these indicators is that they make it possible to construct sky maps of gaussianity from the cmb temperature data . in ref .",
    "we also built and studied in details such maps of gaussianity generated from the data of wmap three and five - year internal linear combination ( ilc ) maps with @xmath0 mask , and found no statistically significant deviation from gaussianity .",
    "here we extend and complement these studies by using our indicators to carry out a new analysis of gaussianity with the cmb data of the so - called ot map@xcite three - year @xmath0 masked map , in which the galactic foregrounds are cleaned with the toh procedure.@xcite",
    "the steps in the construction of our non - gaussianity indicators and the associated maps , are the following :    take a discrete set of points @xmath1 homogeneously distributed on the cmb celestial sphere @xmath2 as the centers of spherical caps of a given aperture @xmath3 ;    calculate for each cap @xmath4 the skewness and kurtosis given , respectively , by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of pixels in the @xmath7 cap , @xmath8 is the temperature at the @xmath9 pixel , @xmath10 is the cmb mean temperature , and @xmath11 is the standard deviation .",
    "clearly , the numbers @xmath12 and @xmath13 obtained in this way for each cap can be viewed as a measure of non - gaussianity in the direction of the center of the cap @xmath14 .",
    "patching together the @xmath12 and @xmath13 values for each cap , one obtains our indicators , i.e. , discrete functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 defined over the celestial sphere , which can be used to measure the deviation from gaussianity as a function of @xmath17 .    clearly , the discrete functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be expanded into their spherical harmonics in order to have their power spectra @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "thus , for example , for the skewness one has @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "similar expressions obviously hold for the kurtosis @xmath16 .",
    "in this section we shall report the results of our calculation of @xmath15 and @xmath16 indicators for the wmap three - year data of the ot with @xmath0 mask , and compare with the results of ref .   for the ilc wmap three - year map with the same mask .",
    "in order to minimize the statistical noise , in the calculations of skewness and kurtosis indicator maps ( @xmath22map and @xmath23map ) we have scanned the celestial sphere with spherical caps of aperture @xmath24 , centered at @xmath25 points on the sphere homogeneously generated by using healpix package.@xcite    figure  [ fig1 ] shows the mollweide projection of the monopole removed @xmath26 ( left ) and @xmath27 ( right ) maps generated from the ot three - year map with a _",
    "kq75 _ mask .",
    "these maps show spots with higher and lower values of indicators @xmath28 and @xmath29 , thus suggesting at first sight non - gaussianity of the cmb as given by ot temperature map .",
    "[ fig1 ] is also suggestive of large - scale dominant components ( low @xmath30 components ) in the maps of both indicators .         in order to obtain quantitative information about the observed inhomogeneous distribution for these non - gaussianity indicators ,",
    "we have calculated the power spectrum of both the @xmath22map and @xmath23map for the three - year ot _ kq75 _ cut - sky map .",
    "these power spectra allow to estimate the statistical significance of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 multipole values , by comparing their power spectra with the averaged power spectrum of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 maps obtained by averaging over a set of @xmath31 monte - carlo - generated statistically gaussian cmb maps . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we depict _ differential _ power spectrum @xmath32 ( overline denotes the mean ) are obtained from the monte - carlo simulations with each map being a stochastic realization of wmap best - fitting angular power spectrum of the @xmath33cdm model , obtained by randomizing the multipole temperature components @xmath34 within the cosmic variance limits .",
    "the right panel shows the corresponding plot @xmath35 for the @xmath23map . for a comparison",
    "the panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] also show the _ differential _ power spectrum obtained from the wmap three - year ilc _ kq75 _ cut - sky map .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the deviation of @xmath18 and @xmath19 values ( @xmath36 ) from the mean values of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are within ( less than ) @xmath39 the mean values ( for each @xmath30 ) obtained from @xmath31 monte - carlo - generated statistically gaussian maps .",
    "this clearly indicates how likely is the occurrence of the multipole values obtained from the ot data in the set of mc multipole values ( from mc maps ) , giving therefore a clear indication of consistency with gaussianity for the ot _",
