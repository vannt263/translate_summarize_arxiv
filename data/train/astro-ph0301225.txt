    "relativistic jets , outflows of matter from regions close to accreting black holes and neutron stars , remain amongst the most spectacular yet poorly explained phenomena in high - energy astrophysics .",
    "they are ubiquitous amongst active galactic nuclei ( agn ) powered by supermassive black holes , as well in spectrally hard and transient outbursting states of stellar mass black holes and neutron stars in x - ray binary systems ( xrbs ) ",
    "see e.g. hughes ( 1991 ) ; mirabel & rodriguez ( 1999 ) .",
    "one of the key questions in the study of these jets is ` how relativistic are they ' ",
    "i.e. what is the lorentz factor ( @xmath3 , where velocity @xmath4 ) of the flow ? in agn , the highest inferred lorentz factors are @xmath5 ( @xmath6 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the hubble constant )  see e.g. vermeulen & cohen ( 1994 ) ; jorstad et al .",
    "multiple recent detections of arcsec - scale x - ray jets from agn with _",
    "( e.g. harris & krawczynski 2002 ) indicate that relativistic flow velocities are maintained over large distances from the jet base .",
    "in two xrbs we have a clear advantage over studies of agn , in that we can observe the proper motions and flux ratios of both approaching and receding radio knots ( a.k.a .",
    "` blobs ' , ` plasmons ' etc . ) associated with the same ejection event .",
    "observations of ejections from these two sources , grs 1915 + 105 ( mirabel & rodriguez 1994 ; fender et al .",
    "1999 ; rodriguez & mirabel 1999 ; fender et al .",
    "2002 ) and gro j1655 - 40 ( tingay et al . 1995 ; hjellming & rupen 1995 ) , provide us with unique diagnostics of the jet geometry .",
    "however , as shall be discussed in this paper , and contrary to widespread misconception , they have _ not _ allowed us to measure the lorentz factor of the flow in either case .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the following discussion we will consider relativistic jets in which proper motions associated with approaching ( @xmath9 ) and receding ( @xmath10 ) components can be measured ( assuming that both sides of the jet have been correctly associated with the same ejection event , the higher proper motion of the two always correponds to @xmath9 ) .",
    "point in the following discussion is the assumption of symmetry in ejection velocity for both sides of the jet ; possible exceptions to this will be discussed at the end .",
    "as described in mirabel & rodriguez ( 1994 ) , measurement of @xmath11 and @xmath10 allows a determination of the following product :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the angle of the ejection to the line of sight and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the approaching and receding proper motions respectively ( see also rees 1966 ; blandford , mckee & rees 1977 ) .",
    "once the proper motions are measured , the angle of ejection , @xmath13 , and consequently the intrinsic velocity , @xmath14 , are uniquely determined for every distance since    @xmath15    and the product @xmath16 is already known .",
    "the variation of @xmath14 and @xmath13 as a function of distance for grs 1915 + 105 was presented in fender et al .",
    "there is a maximum distance to the source corresponding to @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath18 ) :    @xmath19    at this upper limit to the distance you also find the maximum angle of the jet to the line of sight ,    @xmath20",
    "for two galactic x - ray binary systems , grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been measured for multiple ejection events .",
    "the data are summarised in table 1 .",
    "both sources have fairly accurate independent distance estimates . for grs 1915 + 105 , mirabel & rodriguez ( 1994 )",
    "estimate a distance of @xmath21 kpc based on hi measurements .",
    "dhawan , goss & rodriguez ( 2000 ) revise this distance estimate to @xmath22 kpc .",
    "the large x - ray column and optical extinction to the source are in agreement with this relatively large distance .    for gro j1655 - 40 ,",
    "mckay & kesteven ( 1994 ) estimated a distance of 3.5 kpc , and tingay et al .",
    "( 1995 ) estimated a distance of 35 kpc .",
    "the kinematic model fit performed by hjellming and rupen ( 1995 ) resulted in a distance estimated of @xmath23 kpc .",
    "most recently , greene , bailyn & orosz ( 2001 ) derive @xmath24 kpc based on modelling of optical data .",
    "comparison of these distance estimates with the values for @xmath25 listed in table 1 reveals immediately that all the distance estimates place the sources very close to ( or even beyond ! ) @xmath25 .",
    "the result of this is that from such observations we can only place a _",
    "lower limit _ on the lorentz factor of the jets .",
    "this is illustrated in figs 1(a),(b ) . in these figures",
    "the solutions for @xmath14 and @xmath13 , based on the observed proper motions , are plotted as a function of distance to the sources . also indicated",
    "are the best distance estimates , as well as the lorentz and relativistic doppler factors resulting from the solutions to @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "what is clear , for both sources , is that the distance estimates  already fairly accurate  can not do more than place a lower limit of 23 on the lorentz factors of the ejections .",
    "no upper limit is possible as the range of possible distances includes @xmath25 .",
    "consequently we can only place upper limits on the doppler shifts associated with the jets .",
    "these figures clearly illustrate that for these two celebrated sources , the measured proper motions combined with the distance uncertainties do _ not _ allow us to measure how relativistic the jets are . in this paper",
    "we shall show that this will almost always be the case .",
    "a further misunderstanding propagating in the literature is that the flux ratio observed between the approaching and receding knots is somehow an independent confirmation of any distance or velocity measurement already derived from the proper motions .",
    "this asymmetry in brightness between the approaching and receding knots is due to a combination of classical doppler and relativistic aberration effects , both contained in the relativistic doppler factor    @xmath27    an object moving at angle @xmath13 to the line of sight with velocity @xmath14 ( and resultant lorentz factor @xmath26 ) will have an observed surface brightness @xmath28 brighter , where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 corresponds to the average of multiple events in e.g. a continuous jet , @xmath31 corresponds to emission dominated by a singularly evolving event ) .",
    "therefore the ratio of flux densities from approaching and receding knots  measured at the same angular separation from the core , so as to sample the knots at the same age in their evolution  will be given by :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the spectral index of the emitting region , defined such that @xmath34 .",
    "this additional term compensates for the doppler shifted spectrum when observing at a single frequency .",
    "the ratio of the proper motions is simply the ratio of the doppler factors , so    @xmath35    thus once @xmath9 and @xmath10 have been measured , the only additional information obtained by measuring the flux ratio between approaching and receding jet relates to the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "although it may seem counter - intuitive that the flux ratio should remain constant as @xmath14 increases , this is because at the same time @xmath13 is also increasing .",
    "the meaning of @xmath36 will not be explored in detail here ; however a small point is worth making : in observations in which we can be fairly confident that we have resolved a single radio knot , then @xmath36 should have the value 3 .",
    "if we measure a value less than this it may indicate that the bulk velocity of the flow is significantly less than the _ pattern _ velocity which we are observing ( for further discussion see e.g. blandford et al .",
    "it is straighforward to calculate the proper motions for jets of a given @xmath14 and @xmath13 , and compare them to the values we would derive using the method outlined above , for varying estimates of the distance to the source .    in figs 2(a ",
    "d ) we plot the inferred lorentz factor as a fraction of the intrinsic lorentz factor of the jet , as a function of the distance estimated to the source expressed as a fraction of the true distance . in each figure",
    "the different curves indicate different intrinsic angles to the line of sight , and each of the four panels represents a different intrinsic lorentz factor ( 2 , 5 , 10 , 50 ) .",
    "the points at which the curves intersect with the upper abscissa corresponds to @xmath25 for the particular combination of proper motions observed .",
    "apart from the smallest angles and lowest velocities , there is for all the curves an extremely rapid variation in the inferred lorentz factor close to the true distance to the source .",
    "the figures demonstrate clearly that it will be effectively impossible to measure the distance accurately enough to constrain the lorentz factor .",
    "a related point is that all significantly relativistic jets will by necessity lie very close to @xmath0 ( fig 3 ) .",
    "this leads to one useful conclusion  if the jets we observe are intrinsically significantly relativistic , which seems to be the case , then measurements of two - sided proper motions will give us an accurate distance estimate .",
    "as a result , this means that observations of two - sided jet proper motions in agn , were they ever to be observed , would be extremely useful for calibrating the cosmological distance scale .",
    "unfortunately , to date most well - studied agn are significantly doppler - boosted ( so - called ` doppler favouritism ' ) , implying small angles of the jets to the line of sight , and resulting in no measurements of two - sided relativistic proper motions so far .    as noted above , there is a glimmer of hope for the lowest velocities and smallest angles , where the swing in the curves around the true distance is not too dramatic .",
    "however ( a ) this discussion is really concentrating on significantly relativistic jets , and ( b ) the smallest angles to the line of sight will have the largest ratios of proper motions and fluxes between the approaching and receding sides of the jet , making the measurements increasingly hard to make .",
    "this is illustrated in fig 4 , in which the proper motions ( scaled to a distance of 1 kpc ) and resultant apparent velocity as a fraction of the speed of light are plotted for different intrinsic lorentz factors as a function of angle to the line of sight .",
    "the receding proper motions are very similar for all intrinsic lorentz factors , but the approaching proper motions are differing functions which peak at progressively smaller angles ( the peaks occur at @xmath37 radians ) .",
    "note that for both grs 1915 + 105 and gro j1655 - 40 the ratio of approaching to receding proper motions has been @xmath38 , which , as this figure illustrates , indicates immediately that whatever the lorentz factor , they must be at large angles to the line of sight ( and therefore , consulting fig 3 , unless the jets are only mildly relativistic , means that they must both lie at @xmath2 ) .",
    "if we are hoping to measure the lorentz factor from the proper motions of a jet close to the line of sight then the ratio of proper motions becomes increasingly large  and therefore increasingly hard to measure accurately .",
    "the ratio of fluxes is even greater , being the ratio of proper motions raised to some power @xmath36 ( at the same angular separation ) , and so compared to the approaching component the receding jet will appear to be extremely faint and slow moving .",
    "most likely we will observe only the approaching jet , or jet plus core if activity is still ongoing ( as has been the case to date for agn ) .",
    "this leads us to consider an alternative approach to at least limiting the lorentz factor . for a jet of apparent velocity @xmath39 ,",
    "the intrinsic lorentz factor is at least as large as @xmath40 , corresponding to the solution for @xmath41 . in this way observations of one - sided proper motions",
    "can allow us to place a lower limit on the lorentz factor .",
    "how accurate is this method compared to two - sided proper motions ?",
    "in fact it can never place a more constraining lower limit on @xmath26 than can be obtained by measurement of two - sided proper motions .",
    "this is natural , since the lower limits to the lorentz factors measured from one - sided proper motions assume the jet is at its optimum angle , resulting in maximum apparent velocity , which will generally not be the case .",
    "we have established above that it will be practically impossible to do more than place a lower limit on the lorentz factor of a relativistic jet from proper motions , whether one- or two - sided .",
    "however , the proper motions themselves can be used to make a distance estimate to the source , more accurate the more relativistic the jet intrinsically is . what else can we learn from the proper motions ?    as already stated , the ratio of proper motions is also the ratio of doppler factors .",
    "this may be useful in associated unidentified lines with a jet , even though the absolute value of the doppler shift can not be predicted from the proper motions .",
    "for example , to check if an unidentified feature at wavelength @xmath42 is a doppler shifted line of from the approaching jet , look at wavelength @xmath43 to try and find the line from the receding jet ( obviously more difficult since it will be doppler de - boosted ) .",
    "there is even a possibility to achieve the goal of limiting the lorentz factor , in the case of a jet whose angle to the line of sight changes , for example due to precession .",
    "this can be seen from fig 2 , where at lower lorentz factors the @xmath0 is quite a strong function of angle , whereas it is not at all for the higher lorentz factors .",
    "this is illustrated in fig 5 , in which the product @xmath44 is plotted for varying angles , for different lorentz factors .",
    "apart from the smallest angles to the line of sight , at which two - sided proper motions are anyway unlikely to be detected , the most relativistic jets have an almost constant value of this product , whereas the slower jets have a significantly varying product .",
    "for example , a jet with a mean angle to the line of sight of 60 degrees , precessing with a half - opening angle of 20 degrees would produce a @xmath45% change in the product @xmath46 over its precession period if it had an intrinsic lorentz factor of 2 .",
    "if the jet has a lorentz factor of five or more , the fractional change in the product over the precession cycle is 5% or less .",
    "this approach , albeit almost certainly limited to galactic sources ( due to the necessity of tracking in time a periodic precession cycle ) presents an interesting possibility for limiting the lorentz factors .",
    "in this paper the uses and limitations of relativistic jet proper motions have been explored , under the assumption of intrinsically symmetric ejection velocities .",
    "the main results derived are :    * for the two galactic ` microquasars ' for which two - sided proper motions have been measured , even the relatively small uncertainties in the distances estimates result in an almost complete inability to constrain the lorentz and doppler factors .",
    "measurement of the flux ratios of approaching and receding components does _ not _ provide any additional constraints . * exploring the general case ,",
    "it is found that this will nearly always be the situation  i.e. that all relativistic jets will be observed near the distance @xmath0 at which @xmath47 and we will be unable to place an upper limit on the lorentz factor of the flow .",
    "conversely , this means that relativistic jet sources will always be observed close to @xmath0 .",
    "this means that for agn , observations of two - sided proper motions will not allow accurate measurement of the lorentz factor of the jets , but _ will _ be extremely important for calibration of the cosmological distance scale , without requiring the observation of doppler - shifted emission lines .",
    "* it is shown that the product of the approaching and receding proper motions varies significantly with angle to the line of sight for jets which are only mildly relativistic , whereas for highly relativistic jets the product is practically invariant .",
    "this opens up the possibility of constraining the lorentz factor of a precessing jet by measurement of the product around the precession cycle .      as stated above , everything calculated in this paper is only strictly valid under the assumption of symmetric ejection events .",
    "observations of jets from the neutron star xrb sco x-1 ( fomalont et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ) have shown us that the resolved sites of radio emission may in some cases simply be the regions of jet ",
    "ism interaction and may not reflect the underlying bulk velocity of the flow .",
    "this is even more dramatically demonstrated by observations of large - scale decelerating jets from the black hole transient xte j1550 - 564 ( corbel et al . 2002 ; kaaret et al . 2003 ; tomsick et al . 2003 ) . as a result",
    "the application of the results in this paper , e.g. estimating the distance @xmath48 should , wherever possible , be based upon measurements as early as possible in the flight of the ejecta .",
    "finally , the observed correlation between peak radio and x - ray fluxes from x - ray transients ( fender & kuulkers 2001 ) would be destroyed if the lorentz factor of the radio emitting region were too large ( unless the x - ray emission were also beamed , which would however imply a huge selection effect on observations of x - ray binaries )  while current data may be too sparse to constrain this at present , this may be the best approach for limiting the lorentz factors of jets from x - ray binaries in the future .",
    "the author would like to thank guy pooley and marc ribo for comments on this manuscript , and the anonymous referee for useful suggestions ."
