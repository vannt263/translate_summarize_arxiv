    "important progress has recently been achieved in gamma - ray astronomy above 100  gev due to the performance of new stereoscopic systems of atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( act s ) equipped with high - definition imaging cameras , such as cangaroo-3 @xcite , h.e.s.s.@xcite and veritas @xcite .",
    "these setups bring significant improvements in flux sensitivity , angular resolution and energy resolution , with respect to previous experiments in ground - based gamma - ray astronomy .",
    "the increase in sensitivity is directly related to the capability of rejecting hadron - induced showers on the basis of the image shapes and , at least for known point - like sources , of shower directions .",
    "most presently available results from act s were obtained with this last constraint , the signal being extracted from the distribution of the pointing angle ( the so - called `` @xmath2 or @xmath3 plots '' ) . however",
    ", stereoscopic systems now provide images of extended sources  e.g. supernova remnants @xcite  and discover unexpected sources @xcite ; in such studies , hadronic showers must be rejected _ without using the shower direction_. in the present article , we refer to this context as well as to that of point - like sources .",
    "the stereoscopic observation directly provides a simple geometrical reconstruction method based on the hillas parameters @xcite from the different images ; this method has been applied in the hegra experiment @xcite and is presently adapted to h.e.s.s.@xcite .",
    "high - definition imaging provides additional constraints which have already proved very useful , even with a single telescope , as in the cat experiment  @xcite ; in particular , the longitudinal light profile in the image can be modeled , providing a likelihood parameter discriminating gamma - rays from hadrons as well as a simultaneous determination of the direction of the primary @xmath4-ray , of the impact parameter and of the shower energy .",
    "this method was recently extended to h.e.s.s .",
    ", both in single and multi - telescope modes @xcite .",
    "the method described in this article is based on a simple 3d - modeling of the cherenkov light emitted by an electromagnetic air shower .",
    "the rich information contained in several fine - grained images of such a shower provides enough constraints to allow an accurate reconstruction , even by means of a simple model incorporating the rotational symmetry of the electromagnetic cascade with respect to its incident direction .",
    "this allows to select @xmath4-ray - induced showers on the basis of only two criteria with a direct physical meaning : rotational symmetry and small lateral spread . in section [ sec - recmeth ] ,",
    "the simple assumptions used in the shower model are described and justified . in section [ sec - discri ] , on the basis of simulated gamma - rays and of real h.e.s.s .",
    "data from the blazar pks  2155 - 304 , it is shown that a single variable @xmath0 , directly related to the lateral spread of cherenkov photon origins , is an ideal parameter for discriminating primary @xmath4-rays from hadrons . in section [ sec - perfo ]",
    ", the performance of the method in terms of gamma - ray reconstruction efficiency , of angular resolution and of hadronic rejection is evaluated .",
    "finally , the spectral resolution is discussed .",
    "in order to predict the distribution of cherenkov light in the cameras of the different telescopes as expected from a @xmath4-ray shower , one essentially needs the spatial distribution of the emission points of cherenkov photons , and the angular distribution of these photons with respect to the shower axis .",
    "the most important characteristics of electromagnetic showers is that the distributions of secondary particles are on average rotationally symmetric with respect to the shower axis .",
    "the 3d - model of @xmath4-ray showers presented here is based on the simplifying assumptions indicated below :    1 .",
    "the emission points of cherenkov photons are distributed according to a 3-dimensional gaussian law with rotational symmetry with respect to the shower axis , thus characterized by the following parameters ( figure  [ fig : system ] ) : * the polar angles @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the shower axis in the reference frame of the stereoscopic system ; * the coordinates @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( in the same frame ) of its intersection i with the ground ( `` shower core position on the ground '' ) ; * the position of the barycentre b ( `` shower maximum '' ) on the axis , given by the distance @xmath9 ; * the longitudinal ( @xmath10 ) and two - fold degenerate transverse ( @xmath11 ) standard deviations of the gaussian distribution , referred to as `` 3d - length '' and `` 3d - width '' respectively ; * the total number @xmath12 of cherenkov photons emitted by the shower . + the preceding quantities , referred to as `` shower parameters '' , will be determined by the maximum likelihood fit described in section [ sec - fit ] .",
    "2 .   the angular distribution of cherenkov photons , with respect to the shower axis ,",
    "is assumed to be independent of the position of the emission point and of the energy of the primary @xmath4-ray ; its form , which will be given later , is characterized by a single parameter depending on the zenith angle only .        the average longitudinal development of an electromagnetic shower , i.e. the number of electrons and positrons as a function of altitude is given by the greisen formula @xcite and the density profile of the atmosphere .",
    "the number of cherenkov photons emitted per unit length along the shower axis follows a similar distribution ; the variation of the cherenkov threshold with altitude results in a slight shift of about 0.3 radiation lengths downwards of the cherenkov profile with respect to the @xmath13 profile .",
    "the average longitudinal profile of a 200  gev vertical @xmath4-ray shower is shown in figure  [ fig : gauss ] .",
    "this profile is well described by a gaussian distribution ( dotted line in figure  [ fig : gauss ] ) for altitudes lower than 12000  m , particularly in the vicinity of the shower maximum which gives the dominant contribution to the number of collected cherenkov photons . as a matter of fact",
    ", the part of the shower above 12000  m only contributes a few percent of collected photons .",
    "assumption ( 1 ) is thus well justified as far as the longitudinal profile is concerned ; the average 3d - length obtained from profiles such as the one shown in figure  [ fig : gauss ] is of the order of 3000  m at zenith , almost independent of the primary energy .    on the other hand ,",
    "the photosphere 3d - width @xmath11 represents the average lateral spread of the origins of cherenkov photons .",
    "the lateral profile is assumed to be gaussian ; this is not exact since the real distribution is more sharply peaked close to the axis ; however , it will be shown ( from simulations as well as from genuine  h.e.s.s .",
    "data ) that the typical 3d - width of electromagnetic showers at zenith is of the order of 10  m , and in most cases smaller than 15  m. such a structure at a typical distance of 10  km from the telescope is viewed under an angle of 1.5  mrad , smaller than the pixel size .",
    "thus , there is no need for a more accurate description of the lateral distribution .",
    "the photosphere 3d - width , obtained with the constraint of rotational symmetry , is particularly useful to distinguish @xmath4-ray from hadron showers which , in most cases , are much broader .",
    "a priori , assumption ( 2 ) looks more difficult to justify , since the angular distribution of cherenkov photons with respect to the shower axis results from that of electrons ( which depends upon the position within the shower ) combined with the cherenkov cone of each electron whose half - angle depends on the local atmospheric density .",
    "it is thus appropriate to use the variable @xmath14 , in which @xmath15 is the angle between the direction of the cherenkov photon and the shower axis , and @xmath16 is the maximal cherenkov angle at the altitude of the emission point ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 being the refraction index at altitude  @xmath19 ) .",
    "the lateral position in the shower should not be essential for the reasons explained above ; on the other hand , the longitudinal position can be characterized by the shower age , as defined in reference  @xcite . for a given age ,",
    "one is interested in the probability @xmath20 of emission of a cherenkov photon per unit solid angle around a direction making an angle @xmath21 with the shower axis .",
    "the normalization is defined by : @xmath22 simulations show that , expressed as a function of @xmath23 , the functions @xmath24 at fixed age do not depend strongly on the initial energy .",
    "some of them are shown in figure [ fig : tcher ] for showers in the 500  gev-1  tev energy range at different ages .",
    "the distributions are similar except for the peak at @xmath25 , which rapidly decreases when the shower develops . taking this peak into account in the 3d - model did not improve the results significantly .",
    "therefore , we use the following universal function @xmath26 : @xmath27 @xmath28   \\ : \\ : \\ : \\mbox{if}\\ : \\ : \\ :   \\varepsilon > \\eta\\ ] ] in which @xmath29 is fixed by the normalization : @xmath30 .",
    "the graph of this function ( the thick line in figure [ fig : tcher ] ) is in reasonable agreement with the curves obtained from simulations , except in the vicinity of @xmath31 .",
    "this simplified form actually neglects the contribution of the narrow peak around @xmath31 which is only important for small ages , i.e. for high altitudes .",
    "ideally , @xmath16 should be calculated at the altitude of shower maximum , which is a parameter of the likelihood fit .",
    "however , coupling the angular distribution of cherenkov light to the altitude often prevents the maximization procedure from converging and it turned out to be sufficient to use a value of @xmath16 independent of the altitude and of the energy .",
    "its dependence on the zenith angle  @xmath32 was chosen as @xmath33 , a relation which follows if the atmospheric density is assumed to decrease exponentially with altitude .",
    "the preceding 3d - model enables us to work out the expected number of cherenkov photons @xmath34 collected by a given pixel of a given telescope as a function of the shower parameters listed in section  [ sec - model ] .",
    "the calculation is done in the reference frame of the telescope of interest as shown in figure [ fig : tele ] .",
    "the average direction of observation of the pixel of interest makes an angle @xmath35 with the telescope axis and an angle @xmath21 with the shower axis .",
    "we have to sum up the contributions of all photons emitted within the solid angle @xmath36 covered by the pixel , provided they are pointing towards the telescope mirror of area @xmath37 . at the distance @xmath38 from the telescope along the line of sight , in a volume @xmath39 , the density of cherenkov photons @xmath40",
    "is obtained from the shower parameters , using assumption  ( 1 ) . from an emission point @xmath41 in this volume",
    ", the mirror is viewed under the solid angle @xmath42 and the fraction of those photons reaching the mirror is given by @xmath43 . integrating along the line of sight , one finds the expected value of the number of photons collected by the pixel of interest : @xmath44 the last integral is easily calculated , due to assumption  ( 1 ) , as shown in appendix 1 .",
    "the quantities @xmath34 for all pixels , calculated for a set of shower parameters , are further used to build up a likelihood function for each event including at least two images of a given shower .",
    "images have been previously submitted to a cleaning procedure in order to remove isolated clusters of pixels with a small charge which likely result from the night sky background . in the case of h.e.s.s .",
    "data analyzed in this article , the cleaning criteria were similar to those of reference @xcite but slightly looser : pixels in the image were required to have a charge content above 5  photoelectrons and to have a neighbour above 7  photoelectrons ; conversely , pixels above 7  photoelectrons were required to have a neighbour above 5  photoelectrons ; otherwise , their charge contents were cleared .",
    "pixels retained by this cleaning procedure , as well as their immediate cleared neighbours , were further used in the likelihood calculation ; on the other hand , pixels invalidated by the calibration procedure were not included .",
    "the fluctuations considered in the fit are poisson fluctuations on the predicted number of photons falling onto a pixel and those due to the phototube responses , the latter being considered as gaussian .",
    "fluctuations in the shower development are not taken into account , nor are correlations between the contents of different pixels .",
    "this has little effect on the following analysis since no goodness - of - fit parameter is used to discriminate gamma - ray showers from hadronic ones .",
    "the likelihood function for each event , described in appendix 2 , is then maximized with respect to the 8 shower parameters defined in section  [ sec - model ] .",
    "this is achieved by means of the minuit program from cern @xcite .",
    "the simple assumptions of the 3d - model allow a rather fast processing of the events .",
    "it should be emphasized that the present 3d - reconstruction of showers is relatively insensitive to the presence of invalidated pixels in cameras ; for example , an extreme situation in which , in all cameras , 20@xmath45 of the pixels would be damaged would mainly result in a degrading of the angular resolution ( an increase from 0.12@xmath46 to 0.15@xmath46 of the angular error ) with only a 10@xmath45 loss in reconstruction efficiency .",
    "simulations of gamma - ray - induced showers at different energies and zenith angles were used to produce images in the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescopes under normal experimental conditions ( including light pollution by the night sky background ) .",
    "those images were submitted to the cleaning procedure and analyzed according to the 3d - model . about 90% of the simulated showers",
    "were successfully reconstructed . since only one length scale , namely the radiation length ,",
    "governs the development of electromagnetic showers both longitudinally and laterally , it is convenient to express characteristic lengths in units of radiation lengths ( or equivalently in `` air thickness '' in g  @xmath47 ) .",
    "the longitudinal development is thus characterized by the slant depth @xmath48 of shower maximum ( i.e. the thickness of air between the top of the atmosphere and the maximum , as measured along the shower axis ) ; it is calculated from the altitude @xmath49 of the barycentre ( shower maximum ) obtained by the likelihood fit and from the zenith angle @xmath32 .",
    "the relevance of the altitude reconstruction is illustrated in figure [ fig : altgreisen ] in which @xmath48 is plotted as a function of the logarithm of the true energy @xmath50 for a sample of gamma - rays generated with a differential spectrum proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "as expected from the greisen formula @xcite , the average depth of shower maximum increases linearly with @xmath52 .",
    "a similar correlation is obtained between @xmath48 and the logarithm of the total number of cherenkov photons @xmath12 , both quantities being reconstructed by the fit ; this is shown in figure [ fig : nc - vs - depth ] for several values of the primary gamma - ray energy @xmath50 .",
    "this property allows to define an additional constraint characterizing gamma - ray showers : the fitted parameters @xmath48 ( in g  @xmath47 ) and @xmath12 are required to satisfy the following condition  : @xmath53 with @xmath54 , this last term being introduced since the relation between the reconstructed value of @xmath12 and the estimated value of the primary energy depends on @xmath32 .",
    "events satisfying condition ( [ eq : physreg ] ) are represented in the region between the two straight lines shown in figure [ fig : nc - vs - depth ] for showers at zenith .",
    "the fraction of gamma - rays reconstructed by the fit ( about 90% ) is almost unaffected when requiring condition ( [ eq : physreg ] ) which results in an additional loss of 2% for zenith angles lower than 50@xmath46 . on the other hand , the fit ,",
    "as applied to hadronic showers , sometimes converges towards very small or , more often , towards very large depths ) is more restrictive for @xmath4-ray showers at large depths . ]",
    "( figure [ fig : nc - had ] ) . by requiring convergence with fitted parameters satisfying condition ( [ eq : physreg ] ) ,",
    "one removes 70% of hadronic showers .",
    "the remaining ones are compatible with rotational symmetry and condition ( [ eq : physreg ] ) ; however , their 3d - width distribution , much broader than that of gamma - rays , offers additional rejection criteria which we investigate now .",
    "+        the potentiality of the 3d - width @xmath11 for discriminating gamma - rays from hadrons is illustrated in figures [ fig : pksall ] , [ fig : pkssim ] , [ fig : pkssep ] , and [ fig : pks3tel ] , obtained from the analysis of h.e.s.s .",
    "data ( 4 hours live time ) taken in 2004 on the blazar pks2155 - 304 with a mean zenith angle of 30@xmath1 . in order to monitor the hadronic background , data were taken with the telescope axis shifted by an angle @xmath55 from the position of the source ( `` wobble mode '' ) ; in the following , @xmath2 will be referred to as the offset angle .",
    "the background contribution was obtained from 5 `` off '' regions with the same acceptance as the source region .",
    "figure [ fig : pksall ] compares @xmath11 distributions in the source region ( dotted line ) and in 5 background control regions ( solid line ) rescaled by a factor 1/5 . the experimental @xmath11 distribution for gamma - rays , obtained by subtraction ,",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : pkssim ] and found to be in very good agreement with that obtained from simulations based on the spectrum of pks2155 - 304 as measured in reference @xcite .",
    "the 3d - widths of gamma - ray showers are essentially smaller than 20  m , thus contrasting with those of hadron showers , as shown in figure [ fig : pkssep ] .",
    "the separation between both populations is further increased by restricting the histogram to those events observed by at least 3 telescopes ( figure [ fig : pks3tel ] ) ; in this case , the corresponding distribution for gamma - rays is almost unaffected , whereas that of hadrons is shifted towards higher values .",
    "this is easily understood since @xmath11 has a real physical meaning for gamma - ray showers and the number of available images only affects the reconstruction error ; on the other hand , for hadrons satisfying the preceding fit , the assumption of rotational symmetry is generally not valid and the reconstructed value depends on the observation conditions . in any case , most hadronic showers are found to be much broader than gamma - ray showers .",
    "since the preceding fit also yields the altitude of shower maximum , it is convenient to express @xmath11 in `` air thickness '' in g  @xmath47 , i.e. to use the quantity @xmath56 , in which @xmath57 is the density of air at the altitude @xmath49 of the barycentre .    for simulated gamma - ray showers of different primary energies ,",
    "the depth of shower maximum @xmath48 is plotted versus @xmath58 in figure [ fig : w - vs - depth ] , both quantities being reconstructed by the fit and expressed in g  @xmath47 .",
    "the average value of @xmath58 is found to increase with @xmath48 .",
    "this is clearly an effect of the decrease of the cherenkov threshold with depth ; at larger depths , more low - energy electrons further from the axis produce cherenkov light .",
    "simulations show that , on average , @xmath58 scales with @xmath48 ( figure [ fig : w - vs - depth ] ) .",
    "consequently , the dimensionless ratio @xmath59 follows a distribution which , in the absence of reconstruction errors , would be independent of the gamma - ray energy and zenith angle . in the following , the quantity @xmath0 will be referred to as the `` reduced 3d - width '' .",
    "figure [ fig : zenwidth ] shows the @xmath11 distributions for 1  tev gamma - ray showers at zenith angles @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ; in contrast , figure [ fig : zenred ] shows the corresponding distributions for the reduced 3d - width @xmath0 , almost identical as can be seen from table [ tab : zen ] ; only a small extension towards higher values appears at large zenith angles .",
    "furthermore , these distributions depend only slightly on the gamma - ray energy , as shown in table [ tab : en ] , the average value increasing linearly with energy .",
    "consequently , for a large range of primary energies , the @xmath0 distribution for gamma - rays is essentially concentrated in the region @xmath63 of course , the upper limit is the most relevant for eliminating hadrons , the lower limit being nevertheless useful for events viewed by 2 telescopes only ( see figure [ fig : compgh ] ) .",
    "._average values and standard deviations of the @xmath0 distributions for gamma - rays at zenith .",
    "_ [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : rejeff ]    in the study of a point - like source , the @xmath4-ray selection criteria based on shower shape must be complemented by a cut on the angle @xmath35 between the reconstructed direction and that of the source .",
    "for the sake of the present example , we require @xmath35 to be lower than @xmath64 ; this choice reflects the variation of the angular resolution with the zenith angle @xmath32 .",
    "the global @xmath4-ray selection efficiencies @xmath65 and the global hadronic rejection factor @xmath66 , obtained after this last cut , are shown in table [ tab : rejeff ] for different observation conditions .",
    "the global selection efficiency @xmath65 is almost independent of the zenith angle and remains of the order of 50% with no restriction on @xmath67 and reaches 75% for @xmath68 ; as a matter of fact , the angular cut removes most of the events from the halo ( defined according to section [ sec - angres ] ) whose contribution is significant when no restriction on @xmath67 is applied and small for @xmath68 .",
    "the global hadronic rejection factor varies between 2000 and 5000 with no restriction on @xmath67 ( and between 2800 and 8000 for @xmath68 ) .",
    "one often defines a quality factor @xmath69 to characterize the sensitivity of an analysis method . with the rather conservative cuts used above , @xmath70 is of the order of 20 to 40 with no restriction on @xmath67 and is practically doubled when one requires @xmath68 .",
    "it should be noted that a minimal set of cuts have been used in the preceding example and that no optimization procedure has been applied .",
    "additional requirements ( e.g. on the minimum number of photo - electrons per telescope ) and different sets of cuts can be used to improve the analysis , depending on the intensity of the source .",
    "the energy @xmath50 of the primary gamma - ray is reconstructed calorimetrically from the total number of cherenkov photons @xmath12 obtained from the fit .",
    "if the 3d - model of the shower described above were a perfect representation of the electromagnetic shower , @xmath12 would be , on average , almost proportional to @xmath50 . as a matter of fact",
    ", simulations of @xmath4-ray showers for fixed values of @xmath50 , show that the average value of @xmath71 ( noted as @xmath72 ) , obtained from the likelihood fit , varies almost linearly with @xmath52 _ for fixed observing conditions _ ,",
    "namely : telescopes multiplicity @xmath67 , direction of the telescope axes ( i.e. zenith angle @xmath32 ) , direction of the shower axis ( i.e. offset angle @xmath2 ) . for those showers triggering 4 telescopes ,",
    "i.e. those for which the sampling is more homogeneous , the slope @xmath73 is actually close to 1 ; this is shown in figure [ fig : calibzen ] for showers generated on - axis at different zenith angles , as well as in figure [ fig : caliboff ] for showers at zenith generated off - axis at different angles .",
    "+ however , as an effect of the approximations of the 3d - model used in the fit , the coefficients @xmath74 and @xmath75 in the formula @xmath76 depend on the observing conditions ; the slight deviation from linearity at the highest energies for large offset angles is due to shower images not fully contained in the field of view . from figures [ fig : calibzen ] and [ fig :",
    "caliboff ] , one verifies that the slope @xmath74 is slightly higher than 1 for showers triggering 2 or 3 telescopes ( figures [ fig : calibzen2 ] , [ fig : caliboff2 ] , [ fig : calibzen3 ] , [ fig : caliboff3 ] ) . for a given value of @xmath67",
    ", @xmath74 is almost independent of the zenith angle and of the offset angle .",
    "+    the impact parameter @xmath77 , i.e. the distance between the centre of the array and the shower axis , also affects the sampling of the shower . in figures [ fig : calibzen ] to [ fig : caliboff3 ] , @xmath71 was averaged over all values of @xmath77 compatible with the trigger conditions ; a better energy estimate is obtained if the measured value of @xmath77 is taken into account . for fixed values of @xmath67 , @xmath32 and @xmath2 ,",
    "the distributions of @xmath71 are plotted for different values of @xmath77 in figures [ fig : dcore500 ] ( 500  gev on - axis showers at zenith ) ; in most cases , @xmath72 varies only slowly with @xmath77",
    ". however , at large distance this variation can be more important as one can see on the distribution obtained for showers triggering only 2 telescopes , as shown in figure [ fig : dcore500 ] . +    the energy estimator is based essentially on the value of @xmath12 , but also on @xmath67 , @xmath32 , @xmath2 and @xmath77 .",
    "simulations for fixed values of these parameters provide a relation between @xmath72 and @xmath52 which can be generalized to arbitrary values of @xmath32 , @xmath2 and @xmath77 through interpolations .",
    "this same relation is then used for a given event satisfying the likelihood fit to find the energy estimator @xmath78 as a function of @xmath12 , @xmath67 , @xmath32 , @xmath2 and @xmath77 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath79 is found to be gaussian to a good approximation for all observing conditions as shown in figure [ fig : endis ] .",
    "these gaussian distributions are characterized by their bias @xmath80 and their standard deviation @xmath81 .",
    "the variations of @xmath82 and of @xmath83 with energy at different zenith angles are shown in figure [ fig : eresolzen ] for on - axis showers ; figure [ fig : eresoloff ] shows the corresponding variations at different offset angles for showers at zenith ( restricting to @xmath4-ray showers with @xmath84 and an angular distance from the centre of the camera lower than @xmath85 ) . the bias is smaller than 5@xmath45 and",
    "@xmath83 is of the order of 15 to 20% at low zenith angles .",
    "the reconstruction method described above differs from the more traditional ones ( ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) in several aspects :    * the analysis is based on shower parameters in 3 dimensions , not on image parameters ; in this way correlations between different stereoscopic views of the same shower are taken into account . *",
    "gamma - ray candidates are selected on the basis of a few criteria based on physical properties : rotational symmetry of electromagnetic shower , depth of shower maximum , lateral spread of the cherenkov photosphere at shower maximum . *",
    "the distribution of the ratio of the last two variables , namely the `` reduced 3d - width '' @xmath0 , is found to be almost independent of the @xmath4-ray energy and zenith angle and @xmath4-rays can be efficiently selected by requiring @xmath86 for all observing conditions .",
    "this criterium provides a @xmath4-ray / hadron discrimination based on the shower shape ( thus relevant for the study of extended sources ) and completely independent of simulations .    with a minimal set of natural cuts , the selection efficiency for @xmath4-rays as applied to h.e.s.s .",
    "data is rather uniform between 100  gev and 10  tev and of the order of 80% ( shape criteria ) and of 50% ( shape and direction criteria ) ; the angular resolution ( from 0.04@xmath1 to 0.1@xmath1 at zenith ) and the energy resolution ( from 15% to 20% in the same conditions ) are comparable to those obtained with the standard h.e.s.s .  analysis @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in a recent article on the blazar h2356 - 309  @xcite where both analyses were used : using the 3d - model , an excess of 715 @xmath4-ray candidates is obtained with a significance of @xmath87 , to be compared with 591 @xmath4-ray candidates and a significance of @xmath88 with the h.e.s.s .",
    "standard analysis .",
    "furthermore , requiring at least 3 triggering telescopes , the 3d - model yields a higher significance ( @xmath89 ) while keeping 453 @xmath4-ray candidates .",
    "thus , the reconstruction method explained above illustrates how the quality of the stereoscopy , characterized by the telescope multiplicity , improves the angular resolution and the hadronic rejection of the array , thus its sensitivity .",
    "the expected number of cherenkov photons collected by a given pixel is given by formula ( [ eq : qth ] ) in which the notations are defined in figure [ fig : tele ] .",
    "the formula includes the integral @xmath90 , taken along the line of sight corresponding to the pixel of interest .",

    "<S> a simple 3d - reconstruction method for gamma - ray induced air showers is presented , which takes full advantage of the assets of a system of atmospheric cherenkov telescopes combining stereoscopy and fine - grain imaging like the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rich information collected by the cameras allows to select electromagnetic showers on the basis of their rotational symmetry with respect to the incident direction , as well as of their relatively small lateral spread . in the framework of a 3d - model of the shower , its main parameters  incident direction , shower core position on the ground , slant depth of shower maximum , average lateral spread of cherenkov photon origins ( or `` photosphere 3d - width '' ) and primary energy  are fitted to the pixel contents of the different images . for gamma - ray showers , </S>",
    "<S> the photosphere 3d - width is found to scale with the slant depth of shower maximum , an effect related to the variation of the cherenkov threshold with the altitude ; this property allows to define a dimensionless quantity @xmath0 ( the `` reduced 3d - width '' ) , which turns out to be an efficient and robust variable to discriminate gamma - rays from primary hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the @xmath0 distribution varies only slowly with the gamma - ray energy and is practically independent of the zenith angle . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the method as applied to h.e.s.s .  is presented . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the requirements imposed to reconstructed showers , the angular resolution at zenith varies from 0.04@xmath1 to 0.1@xmath1 and the spectral resolution in the same conditions from 15% to 20% .    </S>",
