    "there are many theoretical proposals for variation of the fundamental constants of nature , including the variation of the fine structure constant @xmath0@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "furthermore , many evidences behind recent claims of spatial variation in the fine structure constant , due to ground - based telescopes for the observations of ion absorption lines in the light of distant quasars , have led to much discussion because of the controversial results about how different telescopes should observe distinct spatial variations on @xmath0@xcite .",
    "variation over the cosmological time has also been conjectured@xcite@xcite@xcite . in view of all this",
    ", we should be careful to investigate the veracity of such controversial results .",
    "for this , we will start from a new interpretation of the well - known magueijo - smolin ( ms ) dispersion relation by taking into account the presence of an isotropic thermal background field with temperature @xmath1 , which has been addressed in a previous paper@xcite , where we have found the dependence of the speed of light with temperature of the expanding universe .",
    "starting from this result@xcite , the present work goes further in order to obtain the variation of the planck constant with temperature and also the variation of the electron charge with temperature of the universe ; however we finally conclude that the fine structure constant @xmath0 , as a dimensionless number , has remained invariant with the cosmic time scale ( temperature ) .",
    "thus , we will show the invariance of @xmath0 , i.e. , we will find @xmath2 , where @xmath3@xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that our result about the invariance of @xmath0 is in agreement with the observational results of j. bahcall , w. sargent and m. schmidt@xcite who measured the fine structure constant in quasar @xmath4c@xmath5 and showed that its value did not vary significantly with time , giving support to our theoretical result .",
    "furthermore , we should mention that a recent article on the bayesian reanalysis of the quasar dataset@xcite reveals significant support for a skeptical interpretation in which the apparent dipole effect is driven solely by systematic errors of opposing sign inherent in measurements from the keck and vlt telescopes employed to obtain the observations@xcite .",
    "thus , this reanalysis leads us to question such results which show that the fine structure constant exhibits spatial variations .",
    "this strengthens our defense in favor of its isotropy and also its invariance , according to occam s razor@xcite .",
    "although recent astrophysical data suggest that the fine structure constant @xmath0 has increased over the cosmological time , where the combined analysis over more than 100 quasar systems has produced a value of a relative change of @xmath6 , which is at the @xmath7 significance level@xcite , in contrast , we have laboratory tests that cover only a short time span and they have found no indications for the time - variation of @xmath0@xcite .",
    "their advantage , however , is their great accuracy , reproducibility and unequivocal interpretation .",
    "magueijo and smolin(ms)@xcite proposed a dsr theory , where the total energy of a particle should be corrected close to the planck energy scale ( @xmath8 ) as being an invariant scale , so that they have obtained    @xmath9    where @xmath10 , being @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath8 @xmath12 is the planck energy scale ( @xmath13 gev ) and @xmath14 @xmath15 g ) is the planck mass .",
    "notice that , if @xmath16 , the energy of a particle is smaller than the usual @xmath17 ; however if @xmath18,thus ms - energy@xcite becomes larger than the usual @xmath19 and , in fact , diverges for planck mass particles ( @xmath8 ) . for",
    "reasons that will be naturally justified later , let us consider the 2nd case ( @xmath18)@xcite , where the energy of the particle diverges very close to the planck energy scale .",
    "so we have    @xmath20    with @xmath10 .",
    "the eq.(2 ) above shows that the energy of the particle diverges for the planck energy scale ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "such a correction on energy close to the planck scale could be interpreted as being an effect of light dispersion that provides a variation of the speed of light with the energy scale , where @xmath21 should increase for higher energy scales , so that we can write eq.(2 ) as follows :    @xmath22    where the speed of light depends on the energy scale , such that we have @xmath23 according to eq.(2 ) .",
    "so , combining eq.(2 ) with eq.(3 ) , it is easy to see the following dispersion relation for light , namely :    @xmath24    from where , within a cosmological scenario , we can think that the speed of light has diverged in the early universe close to the planck temperature @xmath25 , which is directly related to the planck energy scale @xmath8 connected to a minimum length ( planck length @xmath26 ) as being an initial singularity with planck temperature , namely :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 m ) is the planck length , @xmath14 is the planck mass and @xmath29k ) is the planck temperature in the early universe with radius of about @xmath30 m .    combining eq.(5 ) with eq.(4 ) and considering any energy scale as being of the form @xmath31 to represent the thermal background energy , we find    @xmath32    where the speed of light has been varied with the temperature of the expanding universe , so that it has diverged in the early universe when @xmath33 ( planck length @xmath26 ) .",
    "we could think that the background thermal energy in the universe works like a special `` medium '' with a kind of anomalous index of refraction [ @xmath34 in the sense that it must obey the following inequality @xmath35 , leading to an increase of the speed of light with higher temperatures , i.e. , in the early universe , we had @xmath36 , as @xmath37 and , thus , @xmath21 has increased drastically at that time . in view of this reasoning",
    ", we can simply write eq.(6 ) in the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , @xmath40 being zero for @xmath33 , which leads to @xmath41@xcite . here",
    "we should stress that such a divergence is possible only if we had to consider the 2nd case for the ms - dsr energy equation@xcite , which leads to a realistic result within a cosmological scenario , i.e. , there must be a singularity for the planck scale .    now , basing on eq.(6 ) , we can simply rewrite ms - energy equation [ eq.(2 ) ] in cosmological scenario due to the background temperature , namely :    @xmath42    where we have @xmath43 . the factor",
    "@xmath44 has a non - local origin since it is related to the background temperature of the whole universe .    from eq.(7 ) , we find @xmath45 , with @xmath46 .",
    "so , the change in the speed of light is @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 . for @xmath49 ,",
    "we get @xmath50 .",
    "we should stress that eq.(7 ) provides a correction on energy @xmath19 with background temperature , which can be justified by the fact that the particle is in the presence of a background thermal bath that leads to an increase of its energy when the temperature of the thermal bath is increased , according to the factor @xmath44 . of course such a temperature",
    "would be increased if the radius of the universe decreases .",
    "now , let us consider the energy of a photon modified by the presence of a given background temperature , namely :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 represents the modified momentum of the photon .    on the other hand , we already know that the energy of a photon is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 being the wavelength of the photon and @xmath57 being its frequency . now ,",
    "if we consider its energy modified by the background temperature , we find    @xmath58    by introducing eq.(6 ) ( @xmath59 ) into eq.(9 ) , we write    @xmath60    where @xmath61 .    in order to recover the usual equation @xmath62 from eq.(10 ) above , it is easy to conclude that @xmath63 should be corrected with temperature in the same way of the speed of light @xmath59 in eq.(6 ) .",
    "so we find    @xmath64    or else @xmath65 , with @xmath54 .",
    "so , in the early universe , when @xmath33 , we conclude that @xmath63 has also diverged like @xmath59 .    by substituting eq.(11 ) into eq.(10 ) , we can simply verify the usual equation @xmath62 .",
    "it is known that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum and @xmath68 is the electric permittivity of vacuum .",
    "thus , based on eq.(6 ) , by correcting this maxwell relation with the temperature of the universe , we write    @xmath69    from where we extract    @xmath70    and    @xmath71    since the electric ( @xmath72 ) and magnetic ( @xmath73 ) aspects of radiation are in equal - footing .",
    "now consider two point - like electrons separated by a certain distance @xmath74 .",
    "the electric potential energy @xmath75 between them could be thought in terms of a certain relativistic energy @xmath76 , so that we have @xmath77 .",
    "so we write    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is a certain relativistic mass related to an electric energy of interaction ( @xmath75 ) between the two electrons .    now , by correcting eq.(15 ) with the presence of a thermal background field according to eq.(6 ) , we write the modified electric potential energy , namely :    @xmath80    from where we get    @xmath81    or else    @xmath82    inserting eq.(14 ) into eq.(18 ) , we find    @xmath83    which implies    @xmath84    or    @xmath85{1-\\frac{t}{t_p}}}\\ ] ]    , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , close to the planck scale ( @xmath88k ) , i.e , only at temperatures of the order of @xmath89k , with divergences at @xmath90k . now , it s easy to make a simple extrapolation of the graphs and see that , for much lower temperatures , i.e , @xmath91 k , such constants had too small variations , remaining practically constants . taking the current values of",
    "@xmath92 m/s , @xmath93j.s and @xmath94c , for example , when computing their values at @xmath95k , we find respectively @xmath96 m/s , @xmath97j.s and @xmath98c . in sum",
    ", all these constants varied very rapidly only too close to the planck temperature , so that @xmath0 finally remains invariant@xcite . ]",
    "the fine structure constant without temperature is @xmath99 .",
    "now , by taking into account a given temperature of the expanding universe , we have    @xmath100    finally , by inserting eq.(6)(@xmath59 ) , eq.(11)(@xmath101 ) and eq.(17)(@xmath102 ) into eq.(22 ) , or by inserting @xmath59 , @xmath101 , @xmath103[eq.(14 ) ] and @xmath104[eq.(20 ) ] into eq.(22 ) , or even by inserting @xmath59 , @xmath63 , @xmath105[eq.(13 ) ] and @xmath104[eq.(20 ) ] into eq.(22 ) , we find    @xmath106    or    @xmath107    or    @xmath108    that is ,    @xmath109    which reveals to us the invariance of the fine structure constant with temperature of the expanding universe and , thus , its invariance over the cosmic time scale , which is supported by meticulous observational data@xcite .",
    "in short , we conclude that , although the universal constants as the speed of light ( @xmath21 ) , the planck constant ( @xmath110 ) and the electron charge ( @xmath111 ) have dependence on the temperature of the universe , the fine structure constant @xmath112 is even more fundamental for being invariant with the cosmological time , probably because @xmath0 is a dimensionless number , since the pure number seems to have a special status in the universe .",
