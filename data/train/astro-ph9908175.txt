    "bl  lac  systems represent an extreme class of active galaxy that exhibit featureless continua and undergo rapid variability at all wavelengths ( c.f .",
    "urry et al .",
    "a variety of models have been proposed to explain this extreme behavior , including both intrinsic processes such as relativistic jet accelerations ( georganopoulos & marscher 1998 ) and external effects such as interstellar scintillation ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",
    "another popular model proposes that bl ",
    "lacs   are in fact optically violent variable ( ovv ) quasars whose continua have been amplified by microlenses in a foreground galaxy ( ostriker & vietri 1985 ) ; here enhanced continuum swamps the quasar emission lines , resulting in the featureless spectrum which characterizes bl  lacs .",
    "however , while this model explains the spectral characteristics of bl ",
    "lacs   the source of the variability is still considered to be intrinsic to the ovv source .",
    "more recent variants of this model propose the microlensed source is a relativistic jet , leading to extremely rapid variability ( gopal - krishna & subramanian 1991 ) , while nottale ( 1986 ) developed a microlensing model utilizing very low mass stars to account for both the variability and spectral properties of bl ",
    "lac  systems .",
    "although problems exist with this microlensing hypothesis ( kayser 1988 ; gear 1991 ; lewis & williams 1997 ) , observationally a number of bl ",
    "lac   systems appear to be superimposed on extended nebulosities ( stickel  1988 ) . while it is obvious that in several of these the nebulosity and the bl ",
    "lac  source are physically associated , in others the extended emission appears to be a foreground galaxy , distinct from the bl ",
    "lac   source ( stocke  1985 ) , bolstering the case for the microlensing of bl  lacs . for microlensing to be effective at introducing rapid variability , a substantial optical depth of stellar objects",
    "is required and the bl ",
    "lac  source must possess a small impact parameter with respect to the foreground galaxy . with this ,",
    "however , macrolensing effects become important and most bl - lacs should appear offset from the core of any foreground lensing galaxy . in a fraction of systems , the impact parameter should be sufficiently small that the source will lie within the multiple imaging region of the lens , leading to several images of the same bl ",
    "lac  source about the core of the galaxy ( narayan & schneider 1990 ) .",
    "observational studies reveal bl  lacs to be well - centered upon their hosts ( abraham 1991 ) and it has been proposed that the redshift of several bl  lacsystems have been mis - identified ( narayan & schneider 1990 ) ; given the generally featureless spectrum exhibited by bl ",
    "lacs   such a conclusion is very likely .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore a particular bright , distant bl ",
    "lac   system , pks  0537441 , with the aim of understanding the role of microlensing in explaining its observed properties with a confirmation its redshift , as well as determining the redshift of the putative galaxy along the line - of - sight .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows ; section  [ pks ] details the previous observations of pks  0537441and the historical development of the microlensing model .",
    "new observations of pks  0537441   are discussed in section  [ obs ] , detailing both the ntt spectroscopy and hst imaging presented in this paper . in section",
    "[ conclusions ] the conclusions of this study are presented .",
    "selected as a quasi - stellar source in the parkes 2700mhz radio source ( peterson  1976 ) , pks  0537441  is seen to be a bright @xmath5 point  like source .",
    "a search for pks  0537441  on the harvard observatory photographic plate collection ( liller 1974 ) allowed the determination of a light curve of almost a century in extent , revealing long  term variations of @xmath65 mag with fluctuations of @xmath62 mag occuring over less than two months . while bl ",
    "lac   systems normally exhibit featureless spectra , weak emission lines are sometimes seen during quiescent periods .",
    "this was found to be the case for pks  0537441  which was observed to possess a prominent emission feature at 5304 ; it was proposed that this line is mg ii @xmath7 , placing bl ",
    "lac  at @xmath8 ( peterson 1976 ; stickel , fried & kuehr 1993 ) . at this redshift",
    "the inferred properties of pks  0537441  places it amongst the most luminous of blazars .",
    "it was also suggested that c iii ] @xmath9 was also seen in these early spectra , although this has not been confirmed in subsequent observations .",
    "imaging by stickel   ( 1988 ) revealed that pks  0537441  lies superimposed within a system of low redshift galaxies .",
    "one of these , a spiral galaxy at @xmath10 , is seen @xmath11  eastward , while pks  0537441  was inferred to lie at the core of a galaxy with an extended exponential disk profile . however , deeper follow - up exposures in the optical and nir with the ntt and eso 2.2 m telescope failed to detect any extended emission around pks  0537441   ( falomo   1992 ; kotilainen  1998 ) , suggesting that the findings of stickel  ( 1988 ) were erroneous .    given its apparent brightness , pks  0537441   is an excellent target for studying the properties of bl  lac   objects and it has therefore been the subject of several monitoring campaigns at various wave - bands .",
    "recently it was the subject of a monitoring campaign over a two week period at radio wavelengths ( romero  1994 ) , which revealed large variations , up to a factor of @xmath12 on time - scales as short as @xmath13 secs .",
    "romero  ( 1995 ) interpreted these as being due to microlensing of a relativistic shock ",
    "front by stars in the putative foreground galaxy . the duration of the events @xmath14   hours implies that , if the variability is microlensing - induced , the lenses must consist of sub - solar mass stars in the range @xmath15 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were obtained on the red arm of the emmi instrument at the ntt , operating in service mode .",
    "six exposures , of total duration 6600  sec ( @xmath16  sec and @xmath17  sec ) , were obtained by observatory staff on nov 8 , 1997 , and jan 3 and 5 , 1998 . taken with the tek2k ccd ( @xmath18 m pixels ) and grism # 4 ,",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range @xmath19@xmath20  at 2.8 / pixel resolution .",
    "the gain was set to 1.1 @xmath21 , giving a read - noise of @xmath22 rms , and the spectrograph slit was oriented north - south .",
    "the seeing at the time of the observations , determined from stellar profiles seeing in short pointing images , was better than @xmath23 for all the exposures .",
    "though the grism is reasonably efficient over the wavelength range covered by our spectra ( more than 60% efficient redward of 7000 , but dropping to 25% at 5800 ) , the system response drops rapidly at the red end of our spectral range due to the rapid drop in the quantum efficiency of the ccd ( @xmath24% efficient at 10000 ) .",
    "the spectra were pre - processed in the usual fashion ( debiasing , flat - fielding ) .",
    "so as to establish whether any extended emission could be seen in the spectra , for each exposure , we extracted the spectrum perpendicular to the dispersion direction in four bands of width @xmath23 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "sky - emission features were subtracted at this stage using the observed sky spectrum @xmath28 away from the blazar as a template .",
    "these spectra were then wavelength calibrated and observations of the standard star ltt2415 were used to remove the telluric features and flux - calibrate the spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents the co - added spectrum ( with the corresponding noise spectrum ) in the @xmath23 extracted band .",
    "the flux in the @xmath27 extracted spectrum is a factor of @xmath29 times lower than that presented by stickel  ( 1988 ) , indicating that pks  0537441  was in a quiescent state .",
    "our spectrum is also flatter , with a slope of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , in contrast to -1.6 seen by stickel  ( 1988 ) .",

    ".    however , note that no absorption features indicative of the presence of an additional galaxy spectrum are present .",
    "in particular , we find no evidence for the mgi @xmath44 absorption complex , at least blueward of @xmath45 . between @xmath45   and @xmath46 , the spectrum",
    "is significantly affected by spurious residuals from the correction for telluric absorption , so the spectrum is not reliable . at the redshift of the blazar the mgi complex would lie at @xmath47 , but again no obvious absorption feature can be identified in figure  [ fig1 ] .    to further search for any evidence of an absorption system",
    "the spectra from the different width bands were subtracted ; as the emission from any galaxy component will be extended , compared to the point - like emission from the quasar source , we would expect that the residual of the subtraction between bands of different width would help to remove the emission from the bl ",

    "close examination of this residual spectrum , however , also reveals a number of the emission features identified in figure  [ fig1 ] , and , given the broad width of the @xmath48 emission , these appear to be due to the bl ",
    "lac   source rather than being galactic in origin . as with figure  [ fig1 ] ,",
    "no significant absorption features indicative of a normal galaxy spectrum are visible in figure  [ fig2 ] , making it impossible to determine the redshift of the extended emission , if present .",
    "is there any indication of the presence of a galaxy in the pks  0537441system ?",
    "as discussed in section  [ pks ] , the existence of a galaxy component in this system has a checkered history , originally detected in the imaging work of stickel  ( 1988 ) , with later studies failing to identify any extended emission ( falomo   1992 ; kotilainen   1998 ) . to address this question ,",
    "high resolution images of pks  0537441  are required .",
    "such observations were taken on the 29th of march 1996 with the planetary camera chip of the wfpc2 instrument on board the hubble space telescope , as part of a larger survey of bl lac hosts ( urry   1997 ; urry   1999 ) .",
    "four exposures , of duration 14  sec , 80  sec , and @xmath49  sec , all in the f702w filter ( a 585  wide passband centered on 6913 ) , were obtained from the hst archive .",
    "a median - combined image of the pc frames is presented in the left - hand panel of figure  [ fig3 ] ; the bl ",

    "stickel  1988 ) .",
    "three other ` images ' are noted ; two of these , marked a1 and a2 have been noted in other imaging campaigns ( stickel   1988 ; falomo  1992 ) , while b1 is noted here for the first time .",
    "the nature of these sources will be discussed in more detail in section  [ conclusions ] .    to search for extended emission beneath pks  0537441 , a point - source profile fit and subtracted from the observed bl ",

    "pks  0537441  is extremely well fit by the modeled point - spread function . at @xmath52",
    ", however , pks  0537441   begins to deviate from this model , with excess flux clearly seen at larger radii , at a level very similar to that of the companion galaxy ( g1 ) ; this is the conclusion reached by stickel  ( 1988 ) . but",
    "again , is this extended emission real ? is the tiny - tim model adequate in describing the point - spread function in these planetary camera frames ?",
    "we note that the surface brightness profile presented by falomo  ( 1992 ) , from ntt images , is similarly well described in the central regions by a stellar point - spread function .",
    "however , their figure  4 shows that there is a systematic enhancement of the surface brightness profile with respect to the point - spread function , at radii beyond @xmath53 .",
    "though they concluded that this excess was not significant , due to their larger photometric uncertainties , this same discrepancy is seen to begin at the same radius in our figure  [ fig4 ] , derived from the ten times higher spatial resolution hst data .",
    "this consistency between our experiment , and that of falomo  ( 1992 ) , indicates that it is likely that we are detecting a galactic component in the pks  0537441  system [ this conclusion was also reached by stickel fried & kuehr ( 1993 ) ] .",
    "in this paper we have presented both spectroscopy and imaging of pks  0537441 ; this bl ",
    "lac   source is seen to possess extreme brightness and violent variability and it has been suggested that it is being microlensed by stars in a foreground galaxy .",
    "the apparent detection of such a system added weight to this suggestion ( stickel   1988 ) , although more recent observations have cast doubt on that claim ( falomo  1992 ; kotilainen  1998 ) . the microlensing hypothesis , however , does suffer from several drawbacks and has led to the suggestion that the redshift of pks  0537441  was misidentified ( narayan & schneider 1990 ) ; given the typically featureless spectrum exhibited by bl ",
    "lac  objects such a conclusion is entirely reasonable .",
    "the observations presented here appear to have fortuitously caught pks  0537441   at a low point in its variability and several prominent emission features arising in the bl ",

    "an examination of these spectra failed to reveal any absorption signature indicative of the putative foreground galaxy supposedly responsible for microlensing the bl ",
    "lac  source .",
    "while several recent observations have failed to identify any signature of such a galaxy , the hst / wfpc2 imaging presented here apparently supports the existence of extended emission around pks  0537441 .",
