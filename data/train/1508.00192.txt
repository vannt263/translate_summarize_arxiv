    "clustering is an important class of data analysis that has been extensively applied in a variety of fields , such as identifying different groups of customers in marketing and grouping homologous gene sequences in biology research  @xcite .",
    "clustering results allow data analysts to gain valuable insights into data distribution when it is challenging to make hypotheses on raw data . among various clustering techniques ,",
    "a grid - based clustering algorithm called wavecluster  @xcite is famous for detecting clusters of arbitrary shapes .",
    "wavecluster relies on wavelet transforms , a family of convolutions with appropriate kernel functions , to convert data into a transformed space , where the natural clusters in the data become more distinguishable .    in many data - analysis scenarios , when the data being analyzed contains personal information and the result of the analysis",
    "needs to be shared with the public or untrusted third parties , sensitive private information may be leaked , e.g. , whether certain personal information is stored in a database or has contributed to the analysis .",
    "consider the databases _ a _ and _ b _ in figure  [ fig : privacy - breach ] .",
    "these two databases have two attributes , _",
    "monthly income _ and _ monthly living expenses _ , and the records differ only in one record , _",
    "u_. without _ u _ s participation in database _ a _ , wavecluster identifies two separate clusters , marked by _",
    "blue _ and _ red _ , respectively . with _",
    "s participation , wavecluster identifies only one cluster marked by color _",
    "blue _ from database _ b_. therefore , merely from the number of clusters returned ( rather than which data points belong to which cluster ) , an adversary may infer a user s participation . due to such potential leak of private information ,",
    "data holders may be reluctant to share the original data or data - analysis results with each other or with the public .    in this paper , we develop techniques to perform wavecluster with differential privacy  @xcite .",
    "differential privacy provides a provable strong privacy guarantee that the output of a computation is insensitive to any particular individual . in other words , based on the output , an adversary has limited ability to make inference about whether an individual is present or absent in the dataset .",
    "differential privacy is often achieved by the perturbation of randomized algorithms , and the privacy level is controlled by a parameter @xmath0 called `` privacy budget '' . intuitively , the privacy protection via differential privacy grows stronger as @xmath0 grows smaller .",
    "wavecluster provides a framework that allows any kind of wavelet transform to be plugged in for data transformation , such as the haar transform  @xcite and biorthogonal transform  @xcite .",
    "there are various wavelet transforms that are suitable for different types of applications , such as image compression and signal processing  @xcite .",
    "plugged in different wavelet transforms , wavecluster can leverage different properties of the data , such as frequency and location , for finding the dense regions as clusters .",
    "thus , in this paper , we aim to develop a general technique for achieving differential privacy on wavecluster that accommodates different wavelet transforms .",
    "we first consider a general technique , , that adapts existing differentially private data - publishing techniques to wavecluster through synthetic data generation .",
    "specifically , we could generate synthetic data based on any data model of the original data that is published through differential privacy , and then apply wavecluster using any wavelet transform over the synthetic data .",
    "seems particularly promising as many effective differentially private data - publishing techniques have been proposed in the literature , all of which strive to preserve some important properties of the original data",
    ". therefore , hopefully the `` shape '' of the original data is also preserved in the synthetic data , and consequently could be discovered by wavecluster .",
    "unfortunately , as we will show later in the paper , this synthetic data - generation technique often can not produce accurate results .",
    "differentially private data - publishing techniques such as spatial decompositions  @xcite , adaptive - grid  @xcite , and privelet  @xcite , output noisy descriptions of the data distribution and often contain negative counts for sparse partitions due to random noise .",
    "these negative counts do not affect the accuracy of large range queries ( which is often one of the main utility measures in private data publishing ) since zero - mean noise distribution smoothes the effect of negative counts .",
    "however , negative counts can not be smoothed away in the synthesized dataset , which are typically set to zero counts .",
    "figure  [ fig : baselinediff ] shows an example of inaccurate clustering results produced by using adaptive - grid  @xcite , as we can see , the synthetic data generated in significantly distorts the data distribution , causing two clusters to be merged as one and reducing the accuracy of the wavecluster results .    motivated by the above challenge , we propose three techniques that enforce differential privacy on the key steps of wavecluster , rather than relying on synthetic data generation .",
    "wavecluster accepts as input a set of data points in a multi - dimensional space , and consists of the following main steps .",
    "first , in the quantization step wavecluster quantizes the multi - dimensional space by dividing the space into grids , and computes the count of the data points in each grid .",
    "these counts of grids form a count matrix @xmath1 .",
    "second , in the wavelet transform step wavecluster applies a wavelet transform on the count matrix @xmath1 to obtain the approximation of the multi - dimensional space .",
    "third , in the significant grid identification step wavecluster identifies significant grids based on the pre - defined density threshold .",
    "fourth , in the cluster identification step wavecluster outputs as clusters the connected components from these significant grids  @xcite . to enforce differential privacy on wavecluster",
    ", we first propose a technique , , that introduces laplacian noise to the quantization step .",
    "however , such straightforward privacy enforcement can not produce usable private wavecluster results , since the noise introduced in this step significantly distorts the density threshold for identifying significant grids .",
    "to address this issue , we further propose two techniques , and , which enforce differential privacy on both the quantization step and the significant grid identification step .",
    "these two techniques differ in how to determine the noisy density threshold .",
    "we show that by allocating appropriate budgets in these two steps , both techniques can achieve differential privacy with significantly improved utility .",
    "traditionally , the effectiveness of wavecluster is evaluated through visual inspection by human experts ( i.e. , visually determining whether the discovered clusters match those reflected in the user s mind )  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , visual inspection is inappropriate to assess the utility of differentially private wavecluster .",
    "visual inspection is not quantitative , and thus it is hard to systematically compare the impact of different techniques through visual inspection .",
    "generally , researchers use quantitative measures to assess the utility of differentially private results , such as relative or absolute errors for range queries and prediction accuracy for classification .",
    "but there is no existing utility measures for density - based clustering algorithms with differential privacy .    to mitigate this problem , in this paper",
    "we propose two types of utility measures .",
    "the first is to measure the dissimilarity between true and private wavecluster results by measuring the differences of significant grids and clusters , which correspond to the outputs of the two key steps ( the significant grid identification and the cluster identification ) in wavecluster .",
    "to more intuitively understand the usefulness of discovered clusters , our second utility measure considers one concrete application of cluster analysis , i.e. , to build a classifier based on discovered clusters , and then use that classifier to predict future data .",
    "therefore the prediction accuracy of the classifier from one aspect reflects the actual utility of private wavecluster .    to evaluate the proposed techniques , our experiments use four datasets containing different data shapes that are particularly interesting in the context of clustering  @xcite .",
    "our results show that and achieve high utility for both types of utility measures , and are superior to and .",
