    "the broad band x - ray spectra ( 2 - 300 kev ) of seyfert 1 galaxies are generally well fitted by a cut - off power law continuum + reflection this model depends on three parameters : the spectral index @xmath0 , the high energy cut - off @xmath1 and the reflection normalization @xmath2 .",
    "the physical interpretation of these parameters is generally done in the framework of thermal comptonization mechanism , which is commonly believed to be the origin of the x - ray emission of seyfert galaxies . using approximate relations ( cf .",
    "section 2 ) , it is then possible to derive , from values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , values of the temperature @xmath3 and optical depth @xmath4 of the `` comptonizing '' hot plasma ( the so - called corona ) .",
    "+ if such approximations are sufficient in isotropic geometries , where comptonization process produces roughly cut  off power law spectra , strong discrepancies may appear in anisotropic ones , especially for small optical depth and large temperature .",
    "the contribution of the first scattering order to the outgoing flux is then significantly reduced producing a spectral break ( the so - called anisotropy break ) in the spectrum .",
    "consequently the physical parameter obtained fitting this class of models to broad band x - ray spectra are substantially different from those derived fitting the same data with the power law + cut  off model . in a recent paper ( petrucci et al . , p00 ) , we have applied accurate comptonization models to fit high quality data of the bepposax long look at ngc  5548 and we have underlined the importance of the anisotropic effects . in the same spirit of p00 , we extend our application of accurate comptonization models to a larger sample of objects .",
    "we report in the following the results of this study .",
    "from the complete sample of seyfert 1 observed by bepposax we have selected six objects ( ngc 5548 , ic 4329a , ngc 4151 , eso 141-g55 , mkn 509 and ngc 3783 ) whose observations have high signal - to - noise ratios and hard spectra yielding a good detection in the pds instrument .",
    "concerning ngc 4151 , we have used the observations of july 1996 and january 1999 .",
    "+ we have fitted the data using two different models for the primary continuum : ( 1 ) an exponentially cut  off power law plus a reflection component from neutral material ( pexrav model of xspec , magdziarz & zdziardski , 1995 ) and ( 2 ) a thermal comptonization spectrum from a disk+corona configuration in slab geometry ( code of haardt ( 1994 , hereafter h94 ) .",
    "the fit parameters of h94 are the temperature of the corona @xmath3 , its optical depth @xmath4 , the temperature of the disk @xmath5 ( assuming a black body soft emission ) and the reflection normalization @xmath2 . on the other hand , the pexrav continuum depends only on 3 parameters : the e  folding energy of the cut  off power law",
    "@xmath6 , the photon index @xmath0 and the reflection normalization @xmath2 .",
    "the temperature @xmath3 inferred from the pexrav fits is simply computed as @xmath7 , keeping in mind that such approximation roughly holds for @xmath8 . for @xmath9 , @xmath10 would be more appropriate .",
    "knowing the temperature , the spectral index derived from the pexrav fit can be used to determine the optical depth using the following relation @xmath11^{1/2}-\\frac{3}{2}$ ] ( shapiro , lightman & eardley , 1976 ) .",
    "this equation is valid for @xmath12 , and we have checked _ a posteriori _ that such condition is roughly matched in all cases .",
    "for all objects , the estimated corona temperatures ( respectively optical depths ) from pexrav are substantially smaller ( respectively larger ) than those inferred with an anisotropic comptonization model ( cf . fig .",
    "1a ) . large differences ( up to a factor 8) are found between the two temperature estimates .",
    "+ the reflection normalizations obtained with h94 cluster around 1 , except for two extreme states of ngc 4151 .",
    "they are , in all cases but one ( es0 141-g55 ) , larger than those found using the simple cut  off power - law model ( cf . fig .",
    "in some cases we obtain differences of factors 45 .",
    "+    the reason of these differences is relatively simple . within pexrav",
    "type models , the slope of the power law , determined with small errors by the lecs and mecs data , can not change , by hypothesis , at higher energies . a cut  off around 100 kev is then required to fit the pds data . in comptonization models ,",
    "the lecs and mecs data determine the slope below the anisotropy break . above this",
    "break the intrinsic spectrum is steeper .",
    "it can thus fit the pds data without an additional steepening beyond 100 kev , allowing for a larger temperature ( and consequently a smaller optical depth to keep , roughly , the same power law slope ) and a larger value of the reflection component normalization .",
    "in fig . 2a and 2b the values of @xmath4 vs. @xmath3 , obtained for the 6 sources using the spectral models h94 and pexrav , are compared with the theoretical relations expected for a plane and hemispherical comptonizing region in energy balance ( the temperature and optical depth then satisfy a definite and univocal relation which corresponds to roughly constant compton parameters @xmath13 \\tau ( 1+\\tau ) $ ] . ) +    the best fit results obtained with h94 ( fig .",
    "2a ) are relatively close to the theoretical expectations for the slab case even if they tend to fall preferentially above the solid line .",
    "the data therefore indicate a comptonization parameter larger than for a pure slab geometry , that is a more `` photon - starved '' configuration .",
    "the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 obtained with pexrav ( cf .",
    "2b ) show the same trend as found with h94 that is larger values of @xmath4 for smaller values of @xmath3 .",
    "they are also above the theoretical expectation for a slab and even above the theoretical expectation for a hemisphere .",
    "therefore this set of parameters suggests , for each source of our sample , a configuration more `` photon - starved '' than a hemisphere .",
    "+ an important difference with respect to the slab model is that the optical depths derived from pexrav fits are generally larger than 1 .",
    "the corona should then be optically thick reducing or canceling the effects of anisotropy .",
    "therefore also the pexrav model has an internal consistency .",
    "however a corona with large optical depth may wash out discrete features from the underlying disk ( e.g. lines and reflection itself ) more than would be desirable .",
    "this problem could be alleviated if the corona was `` patchy '' .",
    "+ we conclude that both a hot , optically thin corona with significant anisotropic effects and a less hot , optically thick , patchy corona with negligible anisotropy are consistent with the available data .      a correlation between the reflection normalization @xmath2 and the photon index @xmath0 has been claimed by zdziarski et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter z99 ) from the study of a large number of ginga observations of seyfert and galactic black hole objects .",
    "yet , the validity of this correlation is still under debate since @xmath2 and @xmath0 are strongly correlated in the fitting procedure ( cf .",
    "for example vaughan & edelson , 2000 ) .",
    "+ we have plotted in fig .",
    "3a the reflection normalization @xmath2 versus the photon index @xmath0 obtained with pexrav .",
    "our data do nt show a clear correlation between the two parameters .",
    "however our sample is biased in favor of objects with hard spectra , to ensure a good detection in the pds instrument . when the 13 objects actually observed by bepposax are taken into account a stronger correlation",
    "is observed ( matt , 2000 ) , in agreement with z99 . in the case of the h94 model",
    "we have no simple way of characterizing the spectral shape .",
    "also results are available for only 6 sources and we can not include the other seyfert 1s observed by bepposax .",
    "therefore a direct comparison with the z99 correlation is not possible .",
    "+    z99 interpret the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath0 in the framework of thermal reprocessing models where @xmath2 is directly proportional to the solid angle subtended by the cold matter surrounding the corona . in this case , the larger @xmath2 and the larger the cooling of the corona resulting in softer spectra ( larger @xmath0 ) .",
    "+ it is interesting that the bepposax data can provide the temperatures associated with sources with different values of @xmath2 or @xmath0 , which were not available from the ginga data used by z99 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "3b where we have plotted @xmath14 vs. the corona temperature @xmath15 .",
    "this plot suggests a _ positive _ correlation between the two parameters , that is , the temperature of the corona is _",
    "larger _ for larger values of the reflection normalization .",
    "a plot of @xmath15 vs. @xmath0 shows that steeper spectra correspond to higher temperatures and ( as a corollary ) to lower optical depths .",
    "+ we note that the slab model analysis suggests different trends .",
    "if we plot @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 for the latter model we find that sources with larger @xmath2 tend to have lower @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "3c ) . looking also at fig 2 it appears that this model yields a smaller range of optical depths for the sources in the sample , thus sources with flatter spectra have larger temperatures , a behavior opposite to what is found with pexrav . + it is interesting to note that , in the interpretation of z99 , the @xmath14@xmath16 correlation of fig .",
    "3b suggests that the corona temperature is larger for larger cooling .",
    "such behavior is expected in pair dominated thermal plasma in pair equilibrium ( i.e. where pair creation is balanced by pair annihilation ) .",
    "indeed , in this case , an increase of the cooling corresponds to a decrease of the number of particles in the hard tail of the thermal particle distribution , and thus to a decrease of the pair production rate .",
    "the number of particles in the thermal bath thus decreases , i.e. @xmath4 decreases .",
    "if the heating is kept constant , the available energy is now shared among less particles , resulting in an increase of the temperature .",
    "+ on the contrary , the anticorrelation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 obtained with the slab corona model ( fig .",
    "3c ) is naturally expected in the framework of reprocessing models but for low pair density corona , in complete opposition with the conclusions deduce from our pexrav fits .",
    "the aim of this paper was to test thermal comptonization models over the high signal to noise bepposax observations of a sample of six seyfert 1 .",
    "we use two types of model : a detailed comptonization code in slab geometry , which treats carefully the anisotropy effects in compton processes , and a simple cut  off power law plus reflection model ( pexrav model of xspec ) .",
    "the latter is a relatively good approximation to comptonization spectra in isotropic geometry and/or optically thick corona .",
    "the main results of this work are the following : + data are well fitted by both models and there is no statistical evidence for a model to be better than the other .",
    "both models give results in agreement with a x - ray source geometry more `` photon starved '' than the slab case .",
    "+ are strong differences between the best fit values of the temperature and optical depth of the corona and the reflection normalization obtained with the two models .",
    "we generally obtained larger corona temperature , smaller optical depth and larger reflection normalization with the slab geometry in comparison to @xmath17 + two models leads to strong different relationships between physical parameters .",
    "for instance , we obtain a correlation between the reflection normalization @xmath2 and the corona temperature with pexrav , and an anticorrelation with the slab corona model .",
    "this has major consequences for the physical interpretation of the data .",
    "+ forthcoming observations with chandra , xmm - newton and integral are expected to bring substantial progress to discriminate between these two types of models for the high energy continuum of seyfert galaxies .",
