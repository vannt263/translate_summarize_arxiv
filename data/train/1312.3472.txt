    "partially wetted colloidal particles can be strongly trapped at fluid interfaces . there",

    "if the colloidal particles deform the interface as a consequence of an external force acting on them , such as their weight or an externally imposed electric field among several actual experimental realizations , the dominant contribution to the capillary interaction is the so - called `` capillary monopole ''        . in the ( experimentally realistic ) limit of small interfacial deformations ,",
    "this force is always attractive and has a range given by the    capillary length @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the surface tension of the interface , @xmath2 is the acceleration of gravity , and @xmath3 is the mass density difference between the fluids on both sides of the interface . in typical experimental configurations",
    "the interparticle separation ( @xmath4 micron ) is much smaller than @xmath5 ( @xmath4 millimeter ) , so that any given particle interacts simultaneously with a huge number of neighbors .",
    "furthermore , at separations smaller than @xmath5 , the capillary attraction varies logarithmically and is formally analogous to two  dimensional ( 2d ) newtonian gravity . in these circumstances ,",
    "the capillary interaction is equivalent to `` screened 2d newtonian gravity '' , with a screening length @xmath5 much larger than any microscopic length scale .",
    "therefore we call this interaction `` long  ranged '' . in this context",
    "the _ tunability _ of such a system is of special interest .",
    "the range of the interaction may in principle be varied by changing the capillary length , which is accessible via changes of the surface tension of the interface , e.g. , due to the addition of surfactants .",
    "additionally , the relevant ratios of the interaction range to other length scales of the system ( most notably , the interparticle separation and the system size ) can be easily altered also by changing these other lengths in experimental setups .",
    "likewise , the amplitude of the capillary monopole and , correspondingly , the strength of the interaction is controllable by means of the external force . therefore , for micron ",
    "sized colloidal particles , such a monolayer can serve as a 2d model system for studying the influence of a `` long  ranged '' interaction as a function of its parametric characteristics .",
    "long  ranged interactions are a subject of active research in various branches of physics ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "corresponding to 2d newtonian gravity , cosmology offers a useful analogy for tackling the problem within the so  called `` cold collapse '' approximation , which is widely used to study clustering of collisionless matter : one neglects any force other than gravity ( including diffusion by thermal motion ) . within this approximation ,",

    "[ fig : phase ] as follows :    * in the region below the line s ( stability limit ) and above the line f ( the fundamental mode is the fastest growing one ) there are in general many unstable modes ( thin blue lines ) , but the fastest growing one is the fundamental mode ( i.e. , with the smallest @xmath97 ) , so that the evolution of the density field is dominated by features at the largest scales in real space ( `` collective collapse '' ) .",
    "furthermore , in this region the effect of a finite range of the capillary attraction , i.e. , @xmath119 , is irrelevant and the relative change in the growth rate between different modes is due to the effect of pressure ( eq .  ( [ eq : tau ] ) ) .",
    "this is the region of gravitational  like collapse , which proceeds on a time scale of the order of jeans time ( because most part of this region lies well below the line @xmath120 and in the `` small system '' region , @xmath121 ) .",

    "therefore , the evolution of the density field is dominated by the growth of small  scale perturbations of a certain preferred size ( `` local collapse '' ) .",
    "this is the region of spinodal  like instability , which also proceeds on a time scale of the order of jeans time , except in the corner region @xmath51 , @xmath122 small ( note the location of the line @xmath120 ) . in this corner",
    "the evolution appears substantially slowed down on the scale of jeans time and it corresponds precisely to the usual scenario of spinodal decomposition in fluids after quenching to a temperature below but not too far from the critical point ( note that the spinodal line is actually the line s ) . *",
    "the transition between the two regimes discussed above is smooth and corresponds roughly to the region below the line f but in the `` small system '' region , i.e. , to the left of or around the lines @xmath121 .",
    "there the evolution consists of the simultaneous clustering at a rate of the order of jeans time of widely differing length scales , including both very small scales and the largest possible ones .",
    "this regime thus shares characteristic features of both the `` spinodal instability '' and the `` gravitational instability '' .",
    "which feature dominates the structure formation ( global or local collapse ) depends critically on the distribution of the initial amplitudes of the density perturbations .",
