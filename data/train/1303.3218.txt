    "controllable slow light is useful for optical delay lines , optical buffers  @xcite , and enhanced nonlinear interactions  @xcite ; however , achieving highly confined slow light with weak fields is impractical due to the high losses suffered as a result of the plasmonic confinement of light  @xcite .",
    "there exists a scheme  @xcite using a flat interface metamaterial - dielectric waveguide for slowing highly confined light through electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite , while using metamaterial to minimize losses .",
    "eit with weak fields is interesting in its own right for fundamental reasons , to distinguish it from autler - townes splitting , and also for applications to weak - field sensing  @xcite .",
    "however , the scheme has the limitation that field confinement in the waveguide is only in one transverse spatial dimension , which allows propagating fields to diverge .",
    "we propose using a cylindrical waveguide structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : guidediagram ] , rather than a flat interface , to inherently provide confinement in both transverse directions and prevent field divergence .",
    "the waveguide is composed of a dielectric core and a metamaterial cladding that surrounds the core .",
    "three - level @xmath0 atoms ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eitsys ] ) are homogeneously embedded throughout the core of the waveguide and are driven by a pump field in a low - loss surface mode  @xcite , thereby enabling eit for slowing the signal field in another low - loss surface mode . to prepare eit",
    "the atoms are initially strongly pumped to depopulate the @xmath1 level and relax to the @xmath2 state .",

    ", the intensity of the pump field is lowered because the weaker the pump field , the greater the reduction of group velocity of the signal field .",

    "metamaterials are designed with artificial structure , giving them electromagnetic responses different to those of their constituent materials .",
    "we consider a fishnet - type metamaterial as they have been well studied , both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "metamaterials of this design are inherently lossy , so the permittivity and permeability expressions must necessarily include dissipation terms .",
    "the permittivity of the fishnet metamaterial is described by the drude model  @xcite , @xmath9 with @xmath10 the permittivity of free space , @xmath11 the background permittivity , @xmath12 the plasma frequency of the metal , and @xmath13 the electric damping term .",
    "the permeability , which is in practice achieved through the structure of the metamaterial , is described by the relation  @xcite @xmath14 with @xmath15 the permeability of free space , @xmath16 the background permeability , @xmath17 a geometric parameter , @xmath18 the resonance frequency , and @xmath19 the magnetic damping term .",
    "equations ( [ epsilonmm ] ) and ( [ mumm ] ) describe the electromagnetic properties of the metamaterial cladding and are used , along with a constant permittivity for the core , to determine the modes of the undoped metamaterial - dielectric waveguide .",
    "after preparation for eit , the @xmath1 state is not populated and the atoms are no longer excited by the pump field , which means the pump field effectively travels in the modes of the undoped waveguide . on the other hand",
    ", the signal field can excite the atoms , so the signal field travels in the modes of the doped waveguide . in the following ,",
    "we develop the theory for finding the modes in the undoped waveguide before finding the modes of the doped waveguide .",
    "the guided modes in a cylindrical waveguide are transverse electric ( te ) , transverse magnetic ( tm ) , or a combination of the two ( denoted he or eh )  @xcite .",
    "the tm and te modes are those with field components @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , with @xmath22 the propagation direction .",
    "we restrict our analysis to tm modes , as they are invariant in azimuthal angle @xmath23 , which allows us to simplify the calculations . in general",
    ", the analysis can be done with any choice of modes .",
    "for the tm modes of the metamaterial - dielectric waveguide , the electric fields have the form @xmath24 with c.c .  indicating the complex conjugate , and @xmath25 the complex propagation constants for the allowed modes of the waveguide , which are obtained by solving the dispersion relation . using the definitions @xmath26 and @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the bessel function and modified bessel function , respectively , the dispersion relation for tm modes in an undoped cylindrical metamaterial - dielectric waveguide is  @xcite @xmath30 with @xmath31 @xmath32 the permittivity of the dielectric core , and @xmath33 the core radius .",
    "with this dispersion relation , we can find the low - loss tm surface mode for the pump field as detailed in  @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility of the undoped waveguide core is simply the dielectric susceptibility , @xmath34 when the core is doped with the three - level atoms , the susceptibility of the core becomes the sum @xmath35 , which alters the guided modes near the eit resonance frequency from those of the undoped guide . to find the low loss tm surface mode of the signal field",
    ", we must solve the wave equation with the susceptibility of the doped waveguide core .",
    "the susceptibility of the pumped three - level @xmath0 atoms under eit is  @xcite @xmath36 with @xmath37 the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath38 the refractive index of the dielectric core with @xmath39 the permeability of the dielectric core , @xmath40 the decay rate from level @xmath41 to level @xmath42 and @xmath43 with @xmath44 the number density of three - level atoms .",

    "the rabi frequency of the pump is @xmath51 with @xmath52 the dipole moment of the @xmath49 transition .",
    "equations  ( [ eitchi ] ) and ( [ rabifreq ] ) have @xmath53 dependence but no @xmath23 or @xmath22 dependence .",
    "this is because the pump is in a tm mode , which has a radial dependence but no azimuthal dependence , implying @xmath23 invariance .",
    "furthermore , the pump is approximated as nondepleting , which implies @xmath22 invariance .",
    "this approximation is valid for short propagation lengths , such that the pump does not deplete considerably .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on this approximation .    for longer propagation lengths the pump does deplete , which reduces the rabi frequency @xmath54 and leads to a further reduction in the group velocity . in this case",
    ", one can treat the whole waveguide as a series of concatenated short sections along the propagation direction , such that the pump intensity in each section is approximately constant .",
    "this treatment allows one to determine the group velocity of the signal in each section and calculate the overall delay of the signal in the whole waveguide .    inside the waveguide core ,",
    "the pump field expression is given by @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 unit vectors in the propagation and radial directions , respectively ; @xmath58 a constant that determines the amplitude of the pump , @xmath59 the complex propagation constant for the pump mode , and @xmath60 we define @xmath61 , which is a parameter adjusted by the amplitude of the pump , with @xmath62 such that @xmath63    the permittivity of the doped core depends on the pump field .",
    "the pump field is in a tm surface mode ( see fig .  [",

    "the thin vertical line indicates the interface between the core and cladding regions.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    so the intensity varies steeply in the radial direction ; thus the signal field experiences a steeply graded refractive index in the core . as a result , within the core , the scalar wave equation used to solve for the modes of the undoped guide is no longer valid for the modes of the doped guide . in the cladding region ,",
    "however , the permittivity and permeability are not spatially dependent , so we can still find the fields in this region using the scalar wave equation .    to solve for the propagation constants and the fields in the doped guide , we must begin with the vector wave equation @xmath64 with @xmath65 the laplacian and @xmath66,&r < a,\\\\ \\epsilon_{\\text{mm}}(\\omega),&r\\geq a , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the effective permittivity of the waveguide with three - level @xmath0 atoms embedded in the core .",

    "( [ vectorwave ] ) can be decoupled into scalar equations with the @xmath22 component taking the form @xmath67 with @xmath68 equation  ( [ tmvectwave ] ) is not generally analytically solvable , except at certain frequencies , so we numerically determine the dispersion and attenuation of the low - loss surface mode near the eit resonance frequency .",
    "there are two main problems with solving eq .",
    "( [ tmvectwave ] ) .",
    "first , @xmath69 is complex , meaning it has two free parameters so a standard shooting method can not be employed  @xcite .",
    "the second problem is that the fitness function , @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 the @xmath23 component of the magnetic field in the core and cladding regions , respectively , is not convex , so implementing a hill descent algorithm is not sufficient to determine if a particular value of @xmath69 is a solution . to circumvent these problems we draw inspiration from the shooting method and employ a trial method to solve eq .",
    "( [ tmvectwave ] ) for @xmath73 .",
    "we need to find @xmath73 for a range of frequnecies of interest .",
    "we begin at a frequency where an exact solution for a tm surface mode is found . to find the solution at an adjacent frequency , we slightly deviate the known @xmath69 at the former frequency to obtain a trial value for @xmath69 and numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ tmvectwave ] ) for @xmath74 ; other components of the field are calculated from this trial @xmath73 . to test whether the trial @xmath69 is acceptable , we check if the corresponding trial @xmath73 satisfies the boundary condition at the core - cladding interface to within a tolerance .",
    "mathematically , the acceptance criterion is @xmath75 .",
    "if the trial @xmath73 does not satisfy the boundary condition , a different trial @xmath69 is chosen by slightly deviating the known @xmath69 at the former frequency and the search is repeated . when an acceptable @xmath69 is found , we repeat the search for the next frequency until @xmath73 of the tm surface mode is determined for a range of frequencies of interest .",
    "we apply the same metamaterial parameters presented in our previous work  @xcite to our calculations in this work .",
    "hence , the tm surface mode of the undoped guide found in  @xcite is the mode for the pump of our scheme .",
    "the metamaterial parameters are shown in table  [ mmparams ] .",
    "the core parameters are @xmath76 , @xmath77 and the core radius @xmath78 . for the three - level atoms embedded in the core , we set the number density @xmath79 so that the resulting permittivity remains positive .",
    "the decay rate of the excited state is @xmath80 and that of the hyperfine state is @xmath81 .",
    "these decay rates are consistent with observed values for @xmath82 ions embedded in bulk y@xmath83sio@xmath84 crystal and under cryogenic conditions  @xcite .",

    "the plot shows that the group velocity of the signal for a metamaterial - clad guide is proportional to @xmath90 , and as @xmath91 , this agrees with eit theory  @xcite .     as a function of pump intensity for a metamaterial - clad guide ( @xmath92 ) with @xmath93 and a metal - clad guide ( @xmath94 ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : fracen ] shows the fractional energy @xmath100 of the tm surface mode of the cylindrical metamaterial - dielectric guide as a function of frequency .",
    "for a given mode the fractional energy is the ratio of the energy in one part of the guide , the core for instance , to the total energy of the mode .",
    "the solid line is for the fractional energy in the core whereas the dashed line is for the cladding .",
    "the fraction of energy in the dielectric does not reach 1 , and some of the signal field penetrates into the metamaterial , leading to a nonzero attenuation .",
    "the results above show that embedding three - level @xmath0 atoms in the core of a metamaterial - dielectric waveguide provides coherently controllable slowing of the signal field with reduced losses . in the next section",
    ", we discuss the loss mechanism in the metamaterial waveguide and explain how the existence of the low loss tm surface mode is due to @xmath19 taking a value less than @xmath13 .",
    "in our calculation , we have treated the claddings as if they are infinitely thick . in practice ,",
    "the tm surface modes for the pump and signal fields only penetrate into the metamaterial to some finite depth , so a finite thickness of the cladding regions is sufficient .",
    "the skin depth for both the signal and pump fields is about @xmath101 , with @xmath102 the wavelength of the signal at the eit resonance . as typical fishnet metamaterial has thickness of @xmath101  @xcite , a few layers of fishnet metamaterial ( with dielectric spacers in between )",
    "is sufficient for the cladding .",
    "we find that the attenuation dip near @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lowlosseit ] ) is not as pronounced in the presence of transverse field confinement in the cylindrical waveguide .",
    "the flat metamaterial - dielectric interface has near - zero attenuation near this frequency , whereas the attenuation dip in the cylindrical guide does not approach zero .",
    "the cause for the nonzero attenuation is that the transverse confinement limits the amount of electromagnetic energy that is ejected from the lossy metamaterial .    to illustrate why transverse confinement lessens the attenuation dip near @xmath6 , consider a cylindrical guide in the limit of an infinite radius . in this limit , the interface that the surface wave propagates along becomes flat and the dispersion relation for the cylindrical waveguide reduces to that for a flat interface waveguide . in the case of the flat interface",
    ", the energy can reside almost completely on the dielectric side , leading to near - zero loss  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , for a cylindrical guide in the zero core radius limit , the core almost vanishes ; hence , the energy propagates almost entirely in the lossy metamaterial , which leads to significant loss . for a waveguide with a finite radius , the fraction of the total energy that can be confined to the dielectric lies between 0 and 1 ; thus there is a non - negligible amount of attenuation due to the field interacting with the metamaterial cladding .",
    "we have considered fishnet metamaterial for our scheme , but the scheme is not restricted to using fishnet metamaterial .",
    "other types of metamaterial are applicable , as long as they have permittivity and permeability functions resembling eqs .",
    "( [ epsilonmm ] ) and  ( [ mumm ] ) , with @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . using other metamaterials",
    "is of interest , because when layered fishnet metamaterials are bent to form a cylindrical cladding , the metamaterial may not interact with the fields isotropically .",
    "there now exist various promising fabrication techniques to building bulk metamaterials instead of layered ones  @xcite , which are isotropic .",
    "this system is assumed to operate at a cryogenic temperature as it provides the advantage of mitigating decoherence effects that reduce eit efficacy  @xcite .",
    "an auxiliary advantage of the cryogenic temperatures is increased charge mobility in metals , thereby decreasing attenuation due to a portion of the electromagnetic fields propagating through the metamaterial cladding  @xcite .",
    "the major drawback of cryogenic temperatures is this system needs to be contained within a cryostat , which will complicate its integration and use with other systems that need to operate at higher temperatures .",
    "we are , however , only suggesting the use of cryogenic temperatures in the interest of achieving a proof - of - principle design .",
    "other effects of cryogenic temperatures to consider are a modified refractive index in the dielectric core and altered core dimensions .",
    "these changes , however , can be measured and compensated for based on the operational requirements .",
    "though our main result concerns controllable slow light , the use of eit in this system means it is also capable of stopping the signal pulse completely by turning off the control field entirely  @xcite .",
    "an important application of stopped light is optical quantum memories  @xcite , to which eit is well suited due to its capacity for direct control .",
    "however , the narrow bandwidth restriction inherent in eit - based schemes places a lower - bound restriction on the duration of the signal pulse .",
    "this has implications in terms of data rates for quantum communication and quantum computation schemes that would use this memory .",
    "the imposed lower bound on pulse duration , which correlates directly with a minimum spatial extent , sets an upper limit on the pulse repetition rate . as the maximum allowable overlap for pulses to remain distinguishable restricts the minimum temporal separation between pulses , the number of pulses that can be processed within a given time window is limited .",
    "the effects of the narrow bandwidth on the information storage capability could be avoided , however , by storing information in ways that are not affected by the reduced bandwidth , such as amplitude and phase  @xcite .",
    "the operational bandwidth of this device can easily be broadened by increasing the pump intensity , but comes at the expense of the group velocity reduction that can be achieved .",
    "this is because the spectral width of the eit transparency window is related to the intensity of the pump field  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the bandwidth can be broadened by using another technique to achieve slow light , such as raman amplification  @xcite or photon echo techniques  @xcite .",
    "however , such schemes come at the expense of increased group velocities and controllability",
    ". the raman amplification technique does have the benefit of room temperature operation .",
    "we have considered two cylindrical dielectric - core waveguides of equal size and dimensions , with one having a metal cladding and the other a fishnet metamaterial cladding ; other types of metamaterial cladding are also considerable .",
    "the permittivities of both claddings are given by the drude model , but the metal cladding has constant permeability and the metamaterial cladding is given by the modified - drude model . the signal field propagating through the waveguides is controllably slowed via electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) due to the three - level @xmath0 atoms homogeneously doped throughout the dielectric core of each waveguide .",
    "we have shown that the low - loss tm surface mode exists in the metamaterial waveguide provided that the permeability of the metamaterial cladding has a real part less than unity , i ..",
    "@xmath106 , and the magnetic damping rate is less than the electric damping rate , i ..  @xmath107 .",
    "previous work has shown that this condition is always true for certain optical metamaterials  @xcite .",
    "we predict that such a cylindrical metamaterial - clad waveguide is capable of delivering the same slowing of light but with reduced loss compared to the cylindrical metal - clad waveguide .",
