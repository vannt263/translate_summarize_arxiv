    "( for a sketch of a proof see @xcite , section 2.5.1 . )",

    "( it should be mentioned that no generalization , or explanation , exists for theorem 1 . )",
    "we supply below all the necessary definitions ; for the general theory of kac - moody lie algebras see @xcite .",

    "this follows from proposition 1 and theorem 3 .",
    "proposition 2 is not new : it is essentially contained in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , @xcite yields a description of a bernstein - gelfand - gelfand resolution of the trivial module over a kac - moody lie algebra .",
    "this is also a free resolution of the trivial module over @xmath73 .",
    "we begin by recalling the notion of the order of a differential operator in the standard calculus .",
    "a linear operator @xmath74 is a differential operator of degree 1 ( that is , @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are functions ) , if the identity @xmath78 holds for any functions @xmath79 .",
    "similarly , an operator of degree 2 is characterized by the identity @xmath80 ( and so on ; but we do not need operators of orders greater than 2 ) .",
    "it is well known that the commutator of operators of order @xmath81 and @xmath82 has the order @xmath83 .    in the non - commutative ( super - commutative )",
    "case of chains / cochains of a lie algebra ( with a euclidean structure ) , the notion of a differential order looks slightly different . in particular , the operator @xmath84 has order 1 which means that@xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "however , the operator @xmath87 has order 2 which means that @xmath88 for @xmath86 .",
    "since the laplace operator is a ( super)commutator of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , it also has order 2 , and we have the following lemma .    the laplace operator @xmath91 has the order 2 , that is , @xmath92 for all @xmath86 .",

    ".      let @xmath98 denote the same as in section 1 .",
    "we will now construct a graded lie algebra @xmath99 with euclidean structures in ( finite - dimensional ) spaces @xmath7 satisfying the conclusion of theorem 3 ( with @xmath60 replaced by @xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , we will see that @xmath0 is unique up to an isometric isomorphism , provided that @xmath100 .",
    "( later on , we will see that @xmath0=@xmath73 . )",
    "first consider a given graded lie algebra @xmath0 with euclidean structures in @xmath7 .",
    "choose an orthonormal basis in each @xmath101 ; then wedge products of the elements of the bases in @xmath102 form orthonormal bases in the chain spaces @xmath103 .",
    "for a fixed @xmath104 , consider the matrix        with rows ( columns ) labeled by the elements of our orthonormal bases in @xmath103 with @xmath82 even ( odd ) .",
    "let the shadowed blocks represent the boundary / coboundary operators in the chain / cochain complexes of @xmath0 , and let the unshadowed blocks be zero .",
    "take two rows or two columns of the matrix @xmath105 corresponding to bases elements @xmath106 ( so @xmath82 and @xmath107 have the same parity ) and compute their dot - product . if @xmath108 , then this dot - product is obviously zero . if @xmath109 , it is also zero because of the relations @xmath110 . finally , if @xmath111 , then this dot - product is the coefficient at @xmath112 in @xmath113 ( and the coefficient at @xmath114 in @xmath115 ) .",
    "now , if the laplace operator @xmath116 is the multiplication by a positive number @xmath117 , then the dot - product of every two different rows , as well as of every two different columns , is equal to zero , and the dot - square of every row or column is equal to @xmath117 ; in other words , the whole matrix @xmath105 is an orthogonal matrix times @xmath118 .",
    "this paves the way for a construction announced in the beginning of the section .",
    "first , we put @xmath119 and choose ( in an arbitrary way ) non - zero vectors @xmath120 to have the length 1 .",
    "take a @xmath121 where @xmath65 s are non - negative integers with @xmath122 .",
    "if @xmath123 , we put @xmath124 ; let @xmath125 .",
    "the matrix @xmath105 described above is fully determined , except the left bottom ( shadowed ) block . away from this block ,",
    "the dot product of every two distinct rows or columns is zero , and the dot - square of every row or column is equal to @xmath126 .",
    "this follows from the identities @xmath127 and also from lemma 1 and the remark after it which implies that the laplace operator @xmath128 with @xmath129 ( fully determined ) is multiplication by @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the columns of our matrix disjoint from the left bottom box are pairwise orthogonal and have dot squares @xmath126 .",
    "we can construct the missing columns making the whole matrix an orthogonal matrix times @xmath130 .",
    "since the dot - squares of the rows above the left bottom block are already equal to @xmath126 , the new columns will be confined to this block .",
    "thus , we will have a @xmath102 ( with @xmath131 ) with a ready orthonormal basis , and the new box yields a bracket @xmath132\\colon(\\lambda^2\\g)^{(k)}\\to\\g^{(k)}$ ] .",
    "moreover , the orthogonality of the columns of the new box to the columns of the box next to the right means precisely that this bracket satisfies the jacobi identity .",
    "( notice that it could happen that @xmath133 ; in this case we do not need any new columns , and simply put @xmath124 . )",
    "this completes the construction promised in the beginning of the section ; the uniqueness is obvious .",
    "it remains to prove that the lie algebra @xmath0 of section 2.2 is @xmath73 .",
    "this follows from three remarks .",
    "first , it follows from the construction of section 2.2 that if @xmath134 and @xmath135 , then the bracket mapping @xmath132\\colon(\\lambda^2\\g)^{(k)}\\to\\g^{(k)}$ ] is onto ; hence , @xmath0 ( like @xmath73 ) is generated by @xmath61 .",
    "second , the defining relations @xmath62 hold .",
    "indeed , the degree @xmath121 of @xmath136 is described by the equalities @xmath137 for @xmath138 .",
    "hence , @xmath139 by construction , this means that @xmath124 , hence @xmath62 .",
    "thus , there is a graded epimorphism @xmath140 .",
    "third , it is true that for all @xmath141 . indeed , for any @xmath142 with @xmath71 , the dimensions @xmath143 are determined inductively from the relation @xmath144 .",
    "a similar relation , @xmath145 ( for the same values of @xmath142 ) follows from proposition 2 and the euler - poincar lemma .",
    "in addition to that , @xmath146 , if @xmath147 , and @xmath148 , if @xmath149 , and @xmath123 . hence , our epimorphism @xmath140 is , actually , an isomorphism .",
    "the construction of section 2.2 shows that the maximal nilpotent subalgebra of a kac - moody lie algebra has a canonical euclidean metric .",
    "the metric depends on the choice of generators of length 1 , but the commutator relations do not depend on anything . in some cases ( like theorem 2 )",
    "this metric looks usual , but sometimes , even in the finite - dimensional case , it is less obvious .",
    "for example , the maximal nilpotent subalgebra of the rank 2 exceptional lie algebra @xmath150 has dimension 6 .",
    "the cartan matrix is @xmath151}$ ] .",
    "there is a basis @xmath152 in @xmath73 with the commutator relations @xmath153=\\sqrt3\\ , e_{1,1},\\ , [ e_{0,1},e_{1,1}]=2\\ , e_{1,2},\\ , [ e_{0,1},e_{1,2}]= \\sqrt3\\ , e_{1,3},\\]]-25pt @xmath154=\\sqrt3\\ , e_{2,3},\\ , [ e_{1,1},e_{1,2}]=\\sqrt3\\ , e_{2,3}.\\ ] ] if we regard this basis as orthonormal , then the laplace operator in @xmath155 is the multiplication by @xmath156 .",
    "a more interesting example is provided by the twisted affine kac - moody lie algebra @xmath157 with the cartan matrix @xmath158}$ ] . this lie algebra ( after factoring over the one - dimensional center ) is embedded into the current lie algebra @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "it is well known that it has a basis @xmath160 such that @xmath18=\\alpha_{ij}e_{i+j}$ ] where the numbers @xmath161 depend only on @xmath162 ( see kac s book @xcite , exercise 8.16 ) .",
    "the basis given in the book of kac is not precisely our canonical basis ; to get the latter , we need to modify it by some coefficients : @xmath163;\\quad e_{8s+1}=2\\left[\\begin{array } { ccc } 0&t^{2s}&0\\\\ 0&0&t^{2s}\\\\ 0&0&0\\end{array } \\right];\\quad e_{8s+2}=\\left[\\begin{array } { ccc } 0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0\\\\ t^{2s+1}&0&0\\end{array }",

    "it follows from our results ( and , actually , can be proved directly ) that there is a basis in @xmath176 represented by uniquely chosen monomial cochains ( that is , products of elements of the basis in @xmath177 dual to our canonical basis ) .",
    "this gives rise to a description of the multiplication in @xmath176 , which , however , is not very explicit .",
    "let us begin with a couple of simple remarks .",
    "second , every monomial cochain representing a non - zero element of @xmath176 should contain at least one factor from @xmath178 ; this implies that the cohomological length of @xmath176 does not exceed the rank of @xmath179 , that is the size of @xmath50 .",
    "third , in the finite - dimensional case , the multiplication in @xmath176 satisfies the poincar duality : if a non - zero element @xmath180 is represented by a monomial cochain @xmath181 , then the complimentary monomial @xmath182 also represents a non - zero cohomology class , @xmath183 , and @xmath184 is a non - zero element in @xmath185 .",
    "it follows from the preceding remark that in the finite - dimensional case of rank 2 there are no other non - zero products .",
    "( it seems likely that in the infinite - dimensional case of rank 2 , the multiplication in @xmath176 is trivial . )    now , let us consider some examples .",
    "let @xmath186 be the lie algebra of ( strictly ) upper triangular @xmath49 matrices , associated to the cartan matrix @xmath187\\ ] ] for this lie algebra , @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "the basis in @xmath190 is parametrized by the integral points of the ellipsoid @xmath191 , or , still better , by the elements of the weyl group @xmath192 whose action on the ellipsoid above is generated by the reflections @xmath193 ( in this formula , @xmath194 and @xmath195 are taken to be zero ) . if @xmath196 , then the corresponding cohomology class @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the length of @xmath199 . in this case , @xmath200 has a unique presentation as the sum @xmath201 of different points of the form @xmath202 and the class @xmath203 is represented by the monomial cochain @xmath204 where @xmath205 takes the value 1 on the one - entry matrix @xmath206 and takes the value 0 on all other one - entry matrices .",
    "moreover , if the presentations @xmath207 are disjoint and @xmath208 , then @xmath209 ; in all other cases , @xmath210 .",
    "for example , there are 6 permutations in @xmath211 : @xmath212 .",
    "accordingly , there are 6 integral points on the ellipse @xmath213,@xmath214the cohomology of @xmath215 is spanned by @xmath216 @xmath217 , and all other products of cohomology classes of positive dimensions are zero .",
    "similarly for @xmath218 ( we write @xmath219 for the permutation @xmath220 ) : @xmath221 @xmath222 @xmath223 the cohomology classes of the corresponding monomial cochains form a basis in the cohomology : @xmath224 the multiplication is described by the following relations : @xmath225      1 feigin , b.l .",
