    "after the first planets were discovered , astronomers have been trying to understand if the stars hosting planets are chemically peculiar and even to search for chemical signatures of planet formation on the hosting stars atmospheres . regarding the chemical peculiarities ,",
    "the most significant result was obtained by @xcite and @xcite where a systematic enhancement in @xmath2-elements was found for most of the metal - poor planet hosts . regarding chemical imprints of planet formation",
    ", the results are still feeding a lively debate .",
    "several studies suggested that the chemical abundance trend with the condensation temperature , t@xmath0 , is a signature of terrestrial planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , that the sun shows `` peculiar '' chemical abundances because of the presence of the terrestrial planets in our solar system @xcite . although these conclusions have been strongly debated in other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter gh10,13 ) , the main reason of the observed chemical `` peculiarities '' was not identified .    here",
    "we explore the origin of the trend observed between [ x / h ] ( or [ x / fe ] ) and t@xmath0 using a sample of 148 solar - like stars from gh10,13 . the more detailed analysis and complete results are presented in @xcite .",
    "our initial sample is a combination of two samples of solar analogs ( 95 stars ) and `` hot '' analogs ( 61 stars ) taken from gh10,13 . for 148 of these stars",
    ", @xcite provides the galactic orbital parameters and the ages .",
    "fifty - seven of these stars are planet hosts , while for the remaining 91 no planetary companion has been detected up to now .",
    "the stellar atmospheric parameters and the slopes of the @xmath3[x / fe]@xmath4 versus t@xmath0 were derived using very high - quality harps spectra .",
    "these slopes are corrected for the galactic chemical evolution trends as discussed in gh10,13 .    throughout the paper we defined solar analogs as stars with ; t@xmath5 = 5777@xmath6200 k ; logg = 4.44@xmath60.20 dex ; [ fe / h ] = 0.0@xmath60.2 dex .",
    "fifteen out of 58 solar analogs in this sample are known to be orbited by planets .",
    "after a detailed analysis , we found that the t@xmath0 trend strongly relates ( at more than 4@xmath7 ) with the surface gravity and stellar age ( see figure 1 ) : old stars are more `` depleted '' in refractory elements ( smaller refractory - to - volatile ratios ) than their younger counterparts . at the same time we found no significant correlation of the t@xmath0 slope with other stellar parameters .",
    "slopes versus ages for the full sample ( _ top _ ) and for the solar analogs ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "gray solid lines provide linear fits to the data points.,width=340 ]    since for fgk dwarf stars in the main sequence one does not expect significant changes in their atmospheric chemical abundances with age , we are led to believe that the observed correlation is likely to reflect the chemical evolution in the galaxy .      moving one step further",
    ", we found a tentative evidence that the t@xmath0 slopes correlate also with the mean galactocentric distance of the stars ( r@xmath1 ) , which we use as a proxy of the birth radii .",
    "this trend is indicating that stars which have originated in the inner galaxy have less refractory elements relative to the volatiles .",
    "this result qualitatively agrees with the recent observations of galactic abundance gradients by @xcite , where the authors used young galactic cepheids for the gradient derivations .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) statistics predict the @xmath8 0.21 probability ( @xmath9 ) that solar analogs with and without planets came from the same underlying distribution for t@xmath0 slope . at the same time",
    ", the same statistics predict a @xmath9 @xmath8 0.20 probability that they stem from the same underlying age distributions .",
    "the latter can be seen in figure 1 .",
    "moreover , planet host and non - host samples show a different distribution of r@xmath1 ",
    "@xmath9 @xmath8 0.007",
    ". clearly , the two subsamples are not consistent with respect to the mean galactocentric distance and age .",
    "interestingly , @xcite has already shown that ( giant ) planet host stars tend to have smaller r@xmath1 and probably originate in the inner disk , which follow the same direction as our findings .",
    "these results suggest that the difference in t@xmath0 slopes observed for solar analogs with and without planets is then probably due to the differences in their birth places and birth moment .",
    "our findings lead us to two interesting conclusions i ) the solar analogues with planets in the solar neighborhood mostly come from the inner galaxy ( chemical conditions for their formation are more favorable ? ) and ii ) the age and galactic birth place are the main factors responsible for the abundance ratio of refractory to volatile elements in the stars .      99 adibekyan , v.  z. , delgado mena , e. , sousa , s.  g. , et al .  2012b , a&a , 547 , a36 adibekyan , v.  z. , santos , n.  c. , sousa , s.  g. , et al .",
