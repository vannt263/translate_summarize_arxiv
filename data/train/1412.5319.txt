    "luminous blue variables are massive evolved stars of the highest luminosity . atmospheres of the stars may be highly unstable at the stages when hydrogen is exhausted .",
    "change in ionization state of the most abundant elements determines changes in the gas opacity and in the mass loss rate , thus it creates a variety of lbv observing manifestations . at the maximum visual brightness lbvs show a - f supergiant spectrum , while at the minimum the same star can have a wnl spectrum .",
    "the relation between lbvs and b[e ] supergiants ( b[e]sg ) is still unclear @xcite : they are comparable in luminosities , and similar in spectrum when lbvs are in their hot phase , but b[e]sgs do not change their brightness significantly .",
    "the standard evolution theory does not predict the existence of lbvs .",
    "there are two possible explanations for lbvs . in the first one @xcite",
    "it is considered that lbv is a transition stage from the main sequence to wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "the second scenario assumes @xcite that lbv is a final stage of high mass star s life before supernova ( sn ) explosion .",
    "an assumption also was made by @xcite that lbv can be a product of stellar evolution in binary systems .",
    "recent observations of gamma - ray bursts and supernovae gave an evidence that the sn shock travels through an extended stellar wind envelope , as in lbv or wr . it was shown than stars can explode as sn at both lbv or wr stages @xcite .",
    "lbv is a rare class of stars at a particular stage of evolution . like other massive stars ,",
    "they tend to reside close to the galactic midplane , where their study is difficult because of high dust extinctions .",
    "an additional problem is the uncertainty in distance estimation .",
    "it makes studies of extragalactic lbvs with known distances especially valuable .",
    "@xcite listed five lbvs ( four lbv candidates ) in the milky way and 15 in other local group galaxies .",
    "four were identified in m31 and four more in m33 . since that time , 38 lbvs or lbv candidates in the milky way",
    "have been reported @xcite , 24 in m31 , and 37 in m33 @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed 4 lbvs in m33 @xcite . using the spitzer space telescope archival data",
    "one more lbv and several wnl stars in our galaxy @xcite were found .",
    "@xcite added two more lbv - candidates to m33 and one more to m31 .",
    "@xcite classified lbvs by types form their spectral features : cool , hot , and p cyg lbvs .",
    "@xcite divided the high luminosity stars by six classes based on their spectrophotometric features : lbvs , feii emission - line stars , of / late - wn stars , hot supergiants , intermediate - type supergiants , and warm hypergiants .",
    "@xcite selected several optical variability types for lbvs : the variables with greater than 0.5 mag amplitude , less than 0.5 mag , ex-/dormant lbvs , and candidates .",
    "majority of lbvs show an infrared spectral excess , which makes their infrared observations favorable . @xcite and",
    "@xcite proposed a new classification scheme for lbvs based on their nir photometry .",
    "massive stars on the ( h - k ) - ( j - h ) diagram ( jhk - diagram ) are subdivided by two groups : b[e]sgs have ( h - k ) @xmath0 0.7 mag , and lbvs show ( h - k ) @xmath1 0.4 mag .",
    "this simple criterion is attractive , although derived from a small sample .",
    "the sample of lbvs with known infrared spectra is rather small , just a few for galactic lbvs @xcite . @xcite present ir spectra for 4 lbv candidates ,",
    "one of which is studied by us in this paper .",
    "they also propose to use co lines for identifying b[e]sgs , and have found two such objects .",
    "it is important to collect more nir spectral observations for deriving reliable classification of the highest luminosity stars .    in the paper we present quasi - simultaneous optical and nir spectroscopy for lbvs ( vara-1 and ae and ) and lbv candidates ( j004051.59 + 403303.0 , j004350.50 + 414611.4 , j004417.10 + 411928.0 , j004444.52 + 412804.0 , j004526.62 + 415006.3 ) in the andromeda galaxy .",
    "further in the paper we will refer to the stars using their first ra coordinate .",
    "we describe their spectra energy distribution ( sed ) and check their lbv nature .",
    "the objects were selected from @xcite .",
    "their list consists of 4 known lbvs ( ae and , af and , var 15 , vara-1 ) , two objects ofpe / wn9 , and 18 more lbv candidates .",
    "we adopt the distance to m31 of 752@xmath227 kpc @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy and photometry were performed with scorpio focal reducer @xcite at the bta 6-meter telescope in october 2011 and october 2012 .",
    "the observing log is shown in table 1 .",
    "the data were reduced using standard idl data reduction package .",
    "the nir spectroscopy was conducted with the triplespec spectrograph at the 3.5-m arc telescope at the apache point observatory in september 2011 and october 2012 .",
    "the spectra were reduced using spextool @xcite .",
    "the bvr photometry was observed simultaneously with the optical spectroscopy .",
    "we compare our photometry with the u , b , v , r , i data from @xcite obtained between october 2000 and october 2001 .",
    "some stars have additional photometry data points published to date : for var  a-1 and ae  and we used u , b , v , r , & i photometry from september 1976 , and j , h , & k from november 1980 from @xcite . for j004051.6 @xcite published the u , b , v , r , & i photometry from august - september 1963 .",
    "the jhk photometry is available from the 2mass survey @xcite . to watch the variability , we used two versions of the catalog : 2mass-1 @xcite ( december 1998 ) , and 2mass-2 @xcite ( november 2000 ) .",
    "there are also jhk magnitudes obtained in november 1980 by @xcite for var  a-1 .",
    "the triplespec guider at the 3.5-m telescope provides simultaneous k photometry .",
    "we estimate the k magnitudes for our objects by the comparison with five non - variable reference stars in the 5-arcmin guider field ( using their 2mass magnitudes ) .",
    "accuracy of our optical photometry is not worse than 0.05 mag .",
    "the massey s estimates have 0.01 mag uncertainty , and those by @xcite have 0.05 mag uncertainty ( 0.1 mag in their ir data ) .",
    "our k estimates have 0.1 mag accuracy , while nir magnitudes from @xcite are 0.2 mag accurate , and the 2mass-1 and -2 data have 0.1 mag accuracy . results of the optical and nir photometry are summarized in table 2 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we develop a new method of sed fitting applicable for lbv stars .",
    "it breaks a well - known reddening - stellar temperature degeneracy by an additional assumption that the bolometric luminosity stays constant while the optical v - brightness may vary significantly .",
    "this is an inherent property of lbvs to change their spectral type keeping its bolometric luminosity constant . having the bolometric luminosity and the reddening fixed",
    ", we calculate the v - magnitudes and the stellar temperatures for different states of lbvs .",
    "our approach is successfully verified with two known lbvs in the andromeda galaxy : vara-1 and ae and .",
    "all considered lbv candidates show spectra typical for either lbvs or b[e]sgs .",
    "the luminosity ranges are in agreement with those for known lbvs in m31 .",
    "all the stars show brightness variability , both in ours and literature data . in two stars , j004417.10 and j004526.62 ,",
    "we have also detected spectral variability .",
    "we conclude that two studied stars , j004051.59 and j004526.62 , are lbvs , because they show significant brightness variability .",
    "since j004350.50 does not show sufficient variability , we can not classify the star confidenly , although in its spectrum , luminosity and location in the jhk diagram the star is similar to lbvs .",
    "the star does not show an obvious lbv - like variability and therefore , it remains an lbv - candidate .",
    "one needs to use additional criteria ( e.g. helium content ) to clarify its nature .",
    "we identify two stars j004417.10 and j004444.5 as b[e]-supergiants .",
    "they have an excess in the jhk bands , especially prominent in the k. they are located in the b[e]sg region on the jhk diagram @xcite . nevertheless , both stars indicated variability , j004417.10 changed its spectrum , whereas j004444.5 changed its optical brightness . because of the variability we do not exclude that the b[e]sg classification of these stars can be changed in the future .",
