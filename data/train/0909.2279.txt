    "the mid - infrared spectra of star forming galaxies are punctuated by a series of broad peaks that dominate the emission between 3 and @xmath5 m . these bands are generally accepted to result from the vibrational modes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) @xcite .",
    "pah molecules  planar lattices of aromatic rings containing from 10 s to 100 s of carbon atoms  suffuse the interstellar medium of our own galaxy .",
    "their vibrational modes are excited by absorption of uv photons , and in heavily star forming galaxies the pah bands alone can contribute a substantial fraction of the reprocessed light . given that bolometric infrared ( ir ) emission has long been an important measure of star formation due to the large fraction of dust - absorbed starlight that is re - emitted in the ir , the pah bands themselves offer great promise as a more detailed diagnostic of star formation history and as a probe of star formation in heavily dust - obscured galaxies .",
    "a major factor limiting the diagnostic use of galactic pah emission is that the detailed physics of large pah molecules is poorly understood .",
    "models of stochastic heating of dust grains predict that the relative strengths of pah bands are dependent on the size distribution of pah grains and on the ionization state of the molecules @xcite",
    ". however laboratory tests of pahs have been limited to smaller size molecules than dominate the interstellar medium @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the confidence with which the results of these models can be applied to interstellar pah spectra is still uncertain .",
    "nonetheless , such models indicate that measurements of relative pah band strengths will provide valuable measures of pah growth and destruction and of the ambient radiation field .",
    "observationally , the overall shape of the pah spectrum shows remarkable similarity across a broad range of environments within our own galaxy , and across a range of star formation histories in other galaxies .",
    "however there are still significant variations observed in the relative strengths of certain pah emission bands . _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) and _ spitzer _ studies @xcite have revealed trends between pah band ratios and various properties of the galaxy , including agn activity , star formation history , and/or galaxy morphology . yet , because these properties are themselves related , it has been difficult to disentangle primary physical processes responsible for variations in pah spectra .    to begin to understand the links between galaxies pah emission and their physical properties , it is essential to study a sample spanning the full range of normal galaxy properties , and this sample must include extensive multi - wavelength data to enable characterization of convolved physical properties . these were the primary driving goals behind the spitzer sdss galex spectroscopic survey ( ssgss ) .",
    "the ssgss sample covers galaxies from the blue cloud to the red sequence and transitional galaxies in between , spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass , colour , and dust attenuation .",
    "it combines both broad - wavelength - coverage and high - resolution irs spectroscopy with a thorough suite of multi - wavelength data spanning the far ultraviolet to the far infrared .",
    "this makes it the ideal data set for studying the connection between galaxies detailed ir emission and their physical properties .",
    "in this paper we study the effect of star formation , metallicity , radiation field , and agn incidence on pah molecules by looking at the connection between relative pah emission strengths and optical diagnostics of these properties . in section  [ obs ]",
    "we describe the sample selection , data reduction and spectral decomposition . in section  [ res ]",
    "we study the relationships between the relative strengths of the strongest pah bands and a range optical diagnostics . in section  [ con ]",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the full details of the ssgss sample selection , observations , and data reduction are reported in odowd et al .",
    "( 2009 , in preparation ) . to summarize :",
    "ssgss is a spitzer spectroscopic survey of 101 normal , star - forming galaxies from the lockman hole region .",
    "this @xmath6 square degree field of low galactic hi / cirrus is extensively surveyed in multiple wavebands .",
    "ssgss galaxies were selected to have coverage by sdss , galex and irac ( 4 channel ) and mips ( 24  , 70  ) .",
    "we applied a surface brightness limit of i@xmath7  mjy  sr@xmath8 , and a flux limit of f@xmath9  mjy .",
    "these criteria yielded 154 galaxies , from which we selected 101 galaxies to span the range of normal galaxy properties by uniformly sampling @xmath1 vs. nuv - k space .",
    "this sample has a redshift range of @xmath10 with median redshift @xmath11 , and a total infrared luminosity range of @xmath12 , with median @xmath13 .",
    "spectroscopy was obtained in staring mode using the low - res short - low ( sl ) and long - low ( ll ) irs modules for the entire sample , providing 5.238.0   coverage with resolving power of @xmath1460 to 125 .",
    "hi - res short - high ( sh ) spectroscopy was obtained for a subsample of the brightest 33 galaxies , providing 9.919.6   coverage at @xmath15 .",
    "for the bright subsample , exposure times were 8  min for the sl and ll modules , and 16  min for sh .",
    "for the remaining sample , exposure times were 8  min for sl and 16  min for ll .",
    "all data were taken during spitzer irs campaign 37 .",
    "we used the 2-d spitzer data products processed by the spitzer pipeline version s15.3.0 , which performed standard irs calibration ( ramp fitting , dark subtraction , droop , linearity correction and distortion correction , flat fielding , masking and interpolation , and wavelength calibration ) .",
    "sky subtraction was performed manually , with sky frames constructed from the 2-d data frames , utilizing the shift in galaxy spectrum position between orders to obtain clean sky regions .",
    "irsclean ( v.1.9 ) was used to clean bad and rogue pixels .",
    "spice was used to extract 1-d spectra , and these spectra were finally combined and stitched manually by weighted mean .    due to problems with some observations , the sample studied in this paper consists of 92 galaxies observed with the low - res modules and a subset of 32 observed at hi - res . in addition , for subset of sources spectrophotometric calibration failed for the sl 2@xmath16 order module , resulting in fluxes a factor of @xmath17 lower than expected based on the sl 1@xmath16 order module spectrum and irac photometry .",
    "we eliminate these sources from analyses involving the affected spectral region , as described in section  [ bad6p2 ] .",
    "figure  [ compspec ] shows the composite low - res spectrum for this sample .",
    "pah features and complexes at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , 12 , 12.6 , and 17   are prominent , as are a number of atomic emission lines .",
    "a thermal dust continuum component dominates redward of @xmath18  .",
    "these composite spectra are normalized between 20   and 24  .",
    "the short- and long - low resolution irs modules have respective slit widths of @xmath1437 and 105 , corresponding to physical sizes of 212  kpc and 1034  kpc over the redshift range of the sample , with respective medians 5.5  kpc and 15.6  kpc .",
    "the reduction process makes a flux correction for aperture effects assuming a point - like source .",
    "the maximum correction is at the intersection of the sl and ll modules , where the slit - loss is @xmath1415% and @xmath1445% respectively .",
    "some error may be introduced due the fact that the different apertures sample different regions of the galaxy .",
    "fortunately , the pah features of primary interest are between 6.2 and 11.3  , and so all lie in the short - low regime , and are thus largely self - consistent .",
    "aperture effects may also arise from the wavelength - dependent psf width . in extended sources , this may result in increased sampling of central regions at the expense of extended regions with increasing wavelength .",
    "we use irac and mips photometry in the 6 , 8 , 16 & 24   bands to explore this effect , and find that the difference due to aperture effects in the 7.7  -to-11.4   pah ratio is on average less than 15% , and we find no systematic bias in this effect with any of the optical properties studied in this paper .    the sdss fibre diameter is 3 , corresponding to a physical 1.69.7  kpc , with a median of 4.5  kpc , over the redshift range of the sample .",
    "this is sufficiently close to the scale sampled by the sl slit that aperture effects with sdss data are expected to be minimal .      to measure the strengths of",
    "the pah features we use the pahfit spectral decomposition code of @xcite ( s07 ) .",
    "this code performs @xmath19 fitting of multiple spectral components , including pah features modeled as drude profiles , the thermal dust continuum , starlight , prominent emission lines , and dust extinction .",
    "for ease of comparison with the results of s07 , we use identical temperatures for the thermal continuum components and identical central wavelengths and widths for the pah features .",
    "we report a sample of the fitted fluxes of the most prominent pah features and pah feature complexes in table  [ pahstrengths ] . these include the 6.2 and 8.3   bands , which are discrete pah features , and the 7.7 , 11.3 , and 17   complexes , which are blends of 3 , 2 , and 4 subfeatures respectively .",
    "henceforth , we refer to individual pah features and complexes of multiple features simply as features. in table  [ pahstrengths ] also report the fitted dust extinction optical depth , @xmath20 and the integrated line strengths for [ neii]@xmath21 and [ neiii]@xmath22 . the full table , including the entire data set and uncertainties for all parameters , is available in the _ astrophysical journal _ electronic edition .",

    "introducing this free parameter has the potential to lead to degenerate solutions and hence to large uncertainties in pah feature strengths , and so we investigated the effect of inclusion / omission of extinction fitting on the fit results .",
    "we find that the strengths measured for the 6.2   and 7.7   pah features are very similar whether or not dust extinction is included , with average deviations of less than 5% and no systematic bias . on the other hand ,",
    "the 8.6   and 11.3   feature strengths appear to be systematically overestimated without the inclusion of silicate absorption by an average of 40% and 20% respectively .    due to this systematic effect ,",

    "this method has the advantage of being independent of assumptions about the physical contributions to the fitted spectrum .",
    "however , having applied this method to all spectra , we find that it significantly underestimates pah strengths because it misses the pah features extended wings , and because the continuum is typically overestimated as the spline fitting points usually include substantial pah flux .",
    "worse , we find that pah ratios are particularly sensitive to the systematic errors of this method as it depends strongly on the variable widths and level of blending of pah features . as a result",
    ", we only report results based on the pahfit decompositions .      the lower sensitivity of the 2@xmath16 order of the irs sl module results in low signal for a number of sources , and hence to problems in fitting the 6.2   feature in some cases . although some 6.2   pah flux is clearly present in almost all galaxies , pahfit failed to find a good fit to this feature in 18 cases . in many of these cases ,",
    "the fit significantly underestimated the 6.2   flux , perhaps because of a small mismatch between the width or peak position of the feature and the fitted drude profile .",
    "it is possible to estimate pah fluxes independently of pahfit , however for the analysis of pah ratios we restrict ourselves to self - consistant pah flux measurements using pahfit .",
    "hence , we omit failed 6.2   fits from analyses that directly involve this feature . by bpt designation ( see sect .",
    "[ bptdiag ] ) these include 10 non - active galaxies , 3 composite sources , and 5 agn .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sampobsred ] , a calibration problem with the sl 2@xmath16 order resulted in aberrantly low fluxes in this order for a further subset of the galaxies .",
    "we identify 14 galaxies whose irac flux in the 5.7   band is significantly greater than the sl 2@xmath16 order flux integrated across this band .",

    "these include 10 non - active galaxies and 4 composite sources .    in total ,",
    "30 galaxies are omitted from analyses and plots involving the 6.2   feature .",
    "while this introduces unquantifiable biases , we still include such analyses where we feel that they remain informative .",
    "however the focus of this work is on the more robust pah measurements - in particular th 7.7   and 11.3   features .      throughout this paper",
    "we colour - code to indicate location in log  @xmath3_{5007}/h\\beta$ ] vs. log  @xmath26_{6583}/h\\alpha$ ] space : the so - called bpt diagram of @xcite ( fig .",

    "red points indicate more powerful agn satisfying the @xcite designation , green points indicate composite sources with weaker active components between the kewley and the @xcite designation , while black points indicate galaxies dominated by stellar light , below the kauffmann designation .",
    "bpt designation must be interpreted carefully . rather than an absolute discriminator between star - forming galaxies , composite sources , and agn , for this study we instead interpret it as a measure of the relative dominance of star - formation and agn with the sloan aperture .",
    "the similarity of the sloan and _ spitzer _ sl apertures means that bpt designation measures this relative dominance within roughly the same galactic region responsible for the observed pah emission .",

    "@xmath31 versus @xmath30 shows a similar scatter , but broadens towards low ratio values .",
    "the tight correlations suggest that lower - wavelength pah features are strongly coupled , and are less - strongly tied to the 11.3   feature .        in this figure",
    ", we also compare our results to two other spectroscopic studies of pah intensities :    s07 present spectral decomposition of irs observations of 59 sings galaxies , and we use an identical spectral decomposition technique ( see sect .  [ fitting ] ) .",
    "an important difference between s07 and our survey is , with their local targets and shorter exposure times , they are dominated by the highest surface brightness regions near the nucleus , while our observations sample more of the extended structure .",
    "their reported pah ratios are very similar to ours , with the exception that the s07 sample have , on average , higher @xmath30 , and lack the small number of galaxies with @xmath32 that we observe .",
    "@xcite ( g08 ) present spectral decomposition of iso and spitzer irs observations of galactic hii regions and dwarf spiral and starburst galaxies .",
    "we take the results of their most comparable decomposition technique , in which fit they lorenzian profiles to the pah bands ( as opposed to the drude profiles used by pahfit ) . while their sample show very similar trends in the 7.7   and 8.6   features versus the 11.3   feature , they find that the 6.2   feature is on average stronger by a factor of 1.3 to 2 than both our results and those of s07 .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to the differences in the fitting techniques .",
    "models of the stochastic heating of dust grains @xcite show that the relative power emitted in a given pah band is strongly dependent on the distribution of grain sizes . in general ,",
    "smaller dust grains emit more power in the shorter wavelength bands and larger grains dominate longer wavelengths bands . in the regime of grain sizes expected in interstellar dust ( 10 s to 100 s of carbon atoms ) , rapid drops are expected in the 6.2   and @xmath33 m bands relative to longer - wavelength features , and in 6.2   relative to 7.7  , with increasing grain size .",

    "thus , any difference in pah ratios is likely due to agn dominance and not to a link between agn and star formation properties .    to better establish the independence of this relationship to star formation we analyse a controlled subsample restricted to a narrow age range , with @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ agnvsnon_pahratiohist ] shows the histogram of @xmath30 for galaxies in this range , split between galaxies with dominant agn activity ( either composite or full agn by bpt designation ) , versus galaxies with dominated by star formation . in this range ,",

    "here we see that , for hard radiation fields as measured by @xmath3/h\\beta$ ] , there is a striking difference in pah ratio between younger and older stellar populations .",
    "younger stellar populations ( @xmath39 ) with hard radiation fields ( [ oiii]/h@xmath43 ) have stronger short wavelength pah bands than older galaxies with similar @xmath3/h\\beta$ ] ( significance : 0.05% for @xmath30 , 3% for @xmath34 ) ; they also have stronger short wavelength bands than galaxies of all ages with softer radiation fields ( [ oiii]/h@xmath44 , significance : 2% for @xmath30 , 1% for @xmath34 ) . older populations with hard ionizing fields ( which are also predominantly agn - dominated ) have stronger long wavelength bands than the other populations ( significance : @xmath370.01% for @xmath30 , 8% for @xmath34 ) .",
    "the differences are illustrated in the histograms to the right of figure  [ d4kbpthist ] .",
    "thus , it seems that the behaviour of pah molecules in the presence of a hard radiation field differs depending on the age of the stellar population , and so it may depend on whether the radiation comes predominately from starburst activity or an agn .",
    "these trends may also arise from a link between metallicity and both radiation field hardness and stellar population .",
    "below , we discuss the factors that drive the evolution of short - to - long wavelength pah ratios :    the youngest galaxies begin their evolution with low @xmath1 , low metallicity , a moderately hard radiation field resulting from starburst activity , and high short - to - long wavelength pah ratios . the increase in metallicity with age",
    "is expected toallow the larger grains that dominate the longer wavelength feature in each ratio to be assembled more efficiently , resulting in a drop in this ratio as seen in section  [ opticalcorrelation ]",

    "this may result in a decrease in the ionization fraction of the pah molecules , which , according to the @xcite models ( fig .",

    ". some of these galaxies experience agn activity , and so are subject to radiation fields that are often much harder than in starburst galaxies . if the initial decrease in pah ratio with age is due to increasing neutral fraction of pah molecules , then agn do not seem to reionize these molecules ; indeed , the trend of diminishing pah ratio with galaxy age continues through an increasing incidence of agn .    in section  [ theeffectofagn ]",
    "we saw that agn seem to cause a decrease in pah ratio , particularly @xmath30 , independently of star formation diagnostics , and that @xmath30 also drops with agn - sourced radiation hardness ( fig .",
    "[ pahratiovsionization ] , lower left ) .",
    "this may be due to preferential destruction of small pah grains by x - rays and/or shocks from the agn .",
    "it may also be due to heating of pah molecules by the agn , as ionization fraction decreases with increasing gas temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , if the agn is capable of heating pah to high temperatures in dense regions , compared to the more diffuse heating by stars , then the net effect may be to reduce the ionization fraction .",
    "this differing effect of an agn- or starburst - sourced hard radiation field on the pah spectrum is consistent with the result of s07 , who plot @xmath30 versus @xmath4_{15.6~\\mu m}/[neii]_{12.8~\\mu m}$ ] for their sample . @xmath4/[neii]$ ] provides a nir measure of the hardness of the radiation field . for a subsample of galaxies with significant agn components ( seyferts and liners )",
