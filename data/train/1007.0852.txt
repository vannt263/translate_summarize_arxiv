    "the above solutions focus on the @xmath42-correlated disorder potential which exhibits a singular zero - temperature limit ; the problem with a finite - width correlator @xmath3 of the random potential has remained unsolved so far . in the present paper ,",
    "we study another problem , originally proposed by larkin @xcite , that is amenable to a complete exact solution .",

    "the basic idea is to linearize the problem , either by an expansion of the original random potential@xcite @xmath2 for small values of @xmath57 , @xmath58 or by an expansion of the correlator @xmath3 , see below .",
    "studying the destruction of long - range order due to the presence of quenched disorder , i.e. , the behavior of the displacement field @xmath1 at large distances @xmath15 , the random shift @xmath6 can be dropped and one arrives at the _ larkin _ or _ random - force model _ described by the hamiltonian ( [ 1dp1 ] ) with",
    "@xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes a ( gaussian ) random force field with zero mean @xmath61 and a correlator @xmath62 its free - energy distribution function @xmath63 has been calculated by gorokhov and blatter @xcite for fixed boundary conditions ; here , we extend this analysis to describe the case of free boundary conditions . furthermore , in our analysis of the larkin model as a short - scale approximation for the random potential problem , we are not allowed to ignore the random shift @xmath6 ; in our study , we assume the latter to be gaussian correlated , @xmath64 and uncorrelated with the force , @xmath65 ; we call this approximation the _ shifted random force model_. both models not only serve as approximations to the random polymer problem on short scales but also describe physical problems where the underlying randomness is described by a ( shifted ) random force field on all length scales .",
    "therefore , below we will quote results for these models for arbitrary lengths @xmath10 .    another approximation discussed in the literature @xcite deals with the expansion of the correlator @xmath66 rather than the potential , @xmath67",
    "also , models have been studied with _ ad hoc _ power - law expressions for the correlator @xcite . here",
    "we point out , that expanding the correlator @xmath3 of the random potential or choosing arbitrary forms for the correlator is a problematic step , as this action may generate a non - spectral correlator introducing an ill - defined gaussian measure and thus lead to an unphysical model at the very start , cf .",
    "[ sec : rppc ] below for a detailed discussion . as an immediate consequence , the mapping to the quantum boson problem requiring integration over the random potential @xmath2 fails . on the other hand , performing the integration over the random potential @xmath2 with a well defined correlator @xmath3 first and expanding the resulting interacting @xmath68 between bosons only thereafter is a perfectly admissible program producing _ identical results _ ; in this case , however , we know that the ( perfectly well defined ) quantum boson problem _ does not _ describe the random polymer problem on scales where the approximate quadratic correlator deviates strongly from the original correlator .    in the following , we will discuss the _ harmonic - correlator approximation _ of the original random polymer problem with the understanding , that the harmonic approximation is done after the mapping to bosons .",
    "this approximation then relates to the above shifted random force model with a force correlator @xmath69 \\ , \\delta(x - x ' ) = u\\,\\delta(x - x')$ ] and the shift described by @xmath70 with the additional advantage to preserve the translation invariance of the problem ( note , that the shifted random force model involves only the constant and mixed ( @xmath71 ) terms in the correlator , with the quadratic terms @xmath72 absent ) .",
    "furthermore , in sec.[sec : rppc ] , we will present a criterion assuring the consistent definition of a correlator : such correlators have to be spectral .",
    "also , we emphasize the difference in terminology introduced above : while the random force and shifted random force approximations to the random potential @xmath2 define proper models of disordered elastic systems , this is not the case when expanding the potential correlator @xmath3 ; this is why we refrain from considering a _ model _ with a harmonically correlated random potential but prefer to talk about a harmonic _ approximation _ to the correlator .    the ( shifted ) random force models and the harmonic - correlator approximation produce similar results for various quantities defined at short scales , such as the mean free energy and the displacement correlator .",
    "while all displacement correlators are identical for the two models and the approximation , the random force model supplies us with the distribution function for the _ relaxational _ free energy ( i.e. , the free energy of the distorted string reduced by the energy of the straight string ) , whereas the shifted random force model and the harmonic - correlator approximation provide the distribution function for the total free energy . comparing the latter two , we note that the results for the harmonic - correlator approximation provide a more consistent description of the original problem eq.([1dp2 ] ) at short distances , as the correlator remains translation invariant , while some terms in the expansion of the random potential are dropped for the shifted random force problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the applicability of the harmonic - correlator approximation is limited to short scales , as the free - energy distribution function @xmath8 suffers from a negative second moment whenever large displacements show up , e.g. , at large distances @xmath10 or at high temperatures @xmath32 ; this is to be expected as the harmonic correlator deviates strongly from the original correlator @xmath3 ( and eventually turns negative ) at large arguments .    for a system with quenched disorder it is usually extremely difficult to find averaged physical quantities , e.g. , the mean free energy @xmath73 .",
    "replica theory , requiring calculation of the disorder - averaged @xmath74-th power of the partition function @xmath75 then comes in as a helpful technique .",
    "usually , it is the limit @xmath76 = \\overline{\\ln z}$ ] , to be calculated after analytic continuation of @xmath74 , which is of fundamental interest .",
    "it turns out ( see below ) that the same quantity @xmath75 and its analytic continuation is relevant in the calculation of the free - energy distribution function @xmath27 , since the latter is nothing but the inverse laplace transform of the former @xcite , hence replica theory seems the technique of choice for the solution of the present problem as well .",
    "however , the shifted random force model defines a quadratic problem that can be analyzed in a straightforward manner , i.e. , the partition function @xmath77 $ ] ( involving an integration over the field ) can be found for any configuration @xmath60 of the random force and the disorder average of its @xmath74-th power can be done in the end .",
    "this is opposite to the replica approach where the integrations are interchanged , with the first integration over the disorder of the replicated system generating an interacting imaginary - time quantum boson problem , which then is solved in a second step ( corresponding to the integration over the field ) .",
    "below , we will discuss both procedures for the larkin model and find that they provide similar challenges .    the disorder ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) and elastic ( @xmath13 ) parameters of the above random polymer problems define convenient and physically relevant length and energy scales : the ratio of @xmath79 and @xmath78 defines the transverse length scale @xmath20 where the shifted random force model approximates well the random polymer problem , @xmath80 comparing the elastic energy @xmath81 with the disorder energy @xmath82 accumulated over a distance @xmath10 , one obtains the corresponding longitudinal scale @xmath83 , @xmath84 finally , the energy scale associated with these length scales is @xmath85 note that the longitudinal ( @xmath83 ) and transverse ( @xmath20 ) scales define the limits of validity where our expansions describe the original random polymer problem .",
    "the parameters are not fully appropriate to describe the results of the larkin model , as the latter is characterized by one disorder parameter ( @xmath78 ) only  to allow for proper comparison , below , we will nevertheless express all physical results through @xmath20 , @xmath83 , and @xmath86 .",
    "for the larkin model , these parameters will combine to expressions containing only @xmath78 and @xmath13 .",
    "besides providing new results for the larkin model and a discussion of its use as an approximation to the random potential problem at short scales , the present study also has its merits from a methodological point of view , since this is the only case where the entire analysis ( direct and via replica ) could be carried through in a complete and consistent manner .",

    "[ sec : rdfb ] ) and then apply it to the ( shifted ) random force models ( sec .  [ sec : rfm ] ) .",
    "we then analyze the harmonic - correlator approximation ( section [ sec : rppc ] ) , analyze its failure due to its non - spectral property , and state the spectral condition to be satisfied by a properly defined random - potential correlator @xmath3 ; furthermore , we briefly present the results for the displacement correlators which are idential in all three cases .",

    "it is important to identify problematic correlators right from the beginning ; indeed , the proper definition of the disorder potential is subject to important constraints @xcite regarding its shape @xmath3 and failure to respect these constraints may lead to unphysical results . consider a random potential @xmath375 and its fourier representation @xmath376 ; then the gaussian distribution function of the random function @xmath377 has the form @xmath378 = p_0 \\exp\\bigl(-\\int \\frac{dq}{2\\pi}\\ ,     \\frac{|v(q)|^2}{2 g(q)}\\bigr);\\ ] ] the width @xmath379 has to be positive and relates to the correlation function @xmath3 via @xmath380 expanding both sides in powers of @xmath57 , @xmath381 and comparing coefficients , we find that the @xmath382-th derivative of @xmath3 in the origin relates to the integral @xmath383 , which is a positive quantity .",
    "hence , we have to be careful in our choice of the correlator @xmath3 .",
    "e.g. , truncating the expansion of @xmath3 beyond some @xmath384 , such that @xmath385 for @xmath386 , we impose the condition @xmath387 which can not be satisfied for a positively defined @xmath379 .",
    "obviously then , choosing a parabolic correlator @xmath388 as in eq.([1dp8 ] ) is in severe conflict with the constraint eq .",
    "( [ 1dp12 ] ) .",
    "the averaging over the disorder potential @xmath2 is undefined for those modes ( in fourier space ) where @xmath379 is negative .",
    "hence , going over from the disordered directed polymer ( a statistical mechanics problem ) to the quantum boson problem is an ill - defined step and the results can not be trusted any longer .",
    "on the other hand , performing the integration over the random potential @xmath2 with a well defined , i.e. , spectral , correlator @xmath3 and expanding the resulting interaction @xmath68 between bosons is perfectly admissible and leads to an _ identical result _ ; in this case , however , we know that the quantum boson problem _ does not _ describe the random polymer problem on scales where the approximate quadratic correlator deviates strongly from the original correlator . nevertheless , in the end we have to appreciate , that the harmonic - correlator approximation ( [ 1dp8 ] ) , although breaking down at lengths beyond @xmath83 , does produce more accurate approximate results for the short - range correlated random potential problem ( [ 1dp2 ] ) than the shifted random force model ( [ vfphi ] ) , although the latter remains formally valid at all length scales @xmath10 .",
    "the ( shifted ) random force model then should be used whenever the disorder landscape is given by a force field as defined by eqs.([vfphi ] ) , ( [ 1dp14 ] ) , and ( [ 1dp14_v ] ) , but not as an approximation to a random potential problem .",

    "( [ 1dp8 ] ) ( leading to the harmonic - correlator approximation ) . while both approximations generate the same results for the even and odd moments to leading order , the next to leading order terms turn out different .",
    "in this situation , the results of the harmonic - correlator approximation have to be trusted , as it consistently accounts for the relevant terms preserving the translation invariance of the problem . collecting all results , we find that the free - energy distribution function for the random potential model at ( @xmath321 and ) small scales is a trivial gaussian of width @xmath418 generated by @xmath6 , with a small negative shift @xmath419 and a small reduction @xmath420 in width due to the random force term in the potential .",
    "finally , we mention a few useful insights regarding the replica technique which derive from our analysis above .",
    "the replica technique provides a link between two seemingly unrelated problems , the classical statistical theory of disordered polymers and the quantum many - body theory of attractive bosons .",
    "several stumbling blocks can be eliminated by properly appreciating the subtleties in this mapping . as is well known , after the mapping from polymers to bosons the disorder correlator assumes the role of the interaction potential . while many shapes for the interaction potential may produce meaningful results for the quantum boson problem , only a restricted set of them ( those describing a correlator with positive spectrum ) relate to a meaningful random polymer problem .",
    "hence , the original choice of physical correlators and any modification thereof during the calculation should be done with great care ; in particular , a simple power - law form @xcite might not work .",
    "e.g. , there is nothing wrong in studying quantum bosons with a simple harmonic interaction @xmath421 and the results obtained for the quantum propagator are perfectly acceptable for any constant shift @xmath79 .",
    "however , interpreting the result for the propagator in terms of a replica partition function and transforming back ( via the inverse laplace transformation ) to random polymers , the resulting distribution function becomes unphysical when setting @xmath422 ; dropping a shift @xmath79 in the potential for the bosons is a trivial shift in energy , while ignoring the same shift in the correlator produces unphysical results for the polymer problem after laplace transformation .",
