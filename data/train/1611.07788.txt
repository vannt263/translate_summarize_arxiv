    "a case of particular relevance is cellular signaling by specific molecules @xcite . the existence and impact of significant sample - to - sample fluctuations in the precise timing of cellular regulation , often at low - copy numbers of the signaling molecules , are by now well established both experimentally and theoretically @xcite . remarkably , despite the highly heterogeneous character of the motion of signaling molecules in the nucleus and cell cytoplasm @xcite the overall signaling kinetics appears to be universally stable , thus allowing cellular operation at a remarkable precision @xcite . in the particular case of transcription regulation",
    "the experimentally observed strong positional correlations between pairs of downstream coregulated genes in both prokaryotic @xcite and eukaryotic cells @xcite indicate that proximity may indeed represent a tuning mechanism , which was also supported theoretically in a 3-dimensional setting @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite such proximity effects should only be relevant for so - called _ geometry - controlled kinetics _ when the molecules explore their surrounding space in a _",
    "compact _ manner , that is , for recurrent motion @xcite such as 1-dimensional diffusion or diffusion on fractals @xcite .     and @xmath0 , respectively , depending on the initial distance to the target ( see text for details ) .",
    "as soon as a time - scale separation exists between @xmath1 and @xmath0 a robust proximity effect emerges , with any two @xmath1 being typical and very similar while any two @xmath0 tend to be strongly dissimilar .",
    "this focusing of @xmath1 in turn enables faster and more precise gene regulation . ]    currently , there is no consensus on whether the eukaryotic chromosome has a fractal structure @xcite . in most bacteria",
    "the dna is segregated and spatially highly organized yet lacks a fractal organization @xcite . in this context",
    "the immediate question arises whether compact exploration is indeed necessary for the observed regulatory precision @xcite : namely , are proximity effects truly limited to compact exploration  or could there in fact be a more general mechanism to boost signaling speed and precision ?    beyond the scope of transcription regulation , initial distances in spatial search processes are important in a large variety of contexts , ranging e.g. from locating enemy vessels in the ocean @xcite and search strategies of animals foraging for food @xcite to the global spreading of diseases @xcite .",
    "here , the initial distance to the target is often essential @xcite , in particular , it plays an important role in the foraging behavior of animals when food resources are sparse @xcite , or in the predation behavior of marine vertebrates , including basking sharks @xcite , jellyfish and leatherback turtles @xcite , and southern elephant seals @xcite .",
    "proximity becomes essential in the first - come - first - serve sense corresponding to a destructive search - limit @xcite , i.e. when the target ( food ) disappears upon the first time location by a searcher .",
    "a key experimental factor in gene regulation is the fact , that in _",
    "each realization _ only the fastest few of the @xmath2 to @xmath3 transcription factor molecules relaying the biochemical signal to a gene determine the outcome ( i.e. the cell s response ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , the arrival of the fastest sperm cell at the egg cell decides the future of the new organism to be formed in each particular case . as we will demonstrate below",
    ", this situation is fundamentally very different from the question of how long it takes for the first signal to arrive _ on average _ in an ensemble of independent non - destructive search realizations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this average scenario could correspond , e.g. to ensemble experiments of molecular signaling effects in a colony of genetically identical cells .",
    "the characteristic arrival time of the fastest searcher in an ensemble of non - destructive search realizations is influenced to a dominant extent by massively dissimilar indirect trajectories , i.e. those which interact with the confining boundary before reaching the target @xcite .",
    "the statistics of such indirect trajectories was found to exhibit a qualitatively different behavior with respect to the compactness of spatial exploration in the limit of a large system size , and were therefore suggested to define two different universality classes @xcite .",
    "how is this finding compatible with the fact that the fpt statistics in both cases follow an exponential asymptotic decay ? and moreover , is the long - time behavior of the fpt statistics also sufficient to describe the first arrival kinetics in each given realization , such as encountered in transcription regulation ?",
    "here we address these questions in two steps .",
    "first , without specifying the actual motion pattern , we prove that the long - time behavior of all molecular target search processes in a confined and in particular small domain belongs to the same universality class , irrespective of whether the dynamics is compact or not .",
    "second , we analyze various specific types of motion patterns and show how poisson - like asymptotics arise if the particle experiences an effective repulsion in the immediate vicinity of the target ( fig . [ scheme ] a and b ) .",
    "in contrast , the proximity effects we uncover and quantify here naturally lead to an accumulation of probability for observing direct trajectories for both compact and non - compact poisson - like dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ scheme]c ) , which enhances the speed and precision of the target search process . in this sense , to rationalize the proximity effect in gene regulation one needs to consider explicitly the statistics of direct trajectories , i.e. those which do not interact with the confining boundary before reaching the target . using experimentally relevant parameters for transcription regulation",
    "we argue that proximity effects may indeed represent a universal means for tuning cellular signaling kinetics .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "first we represent a general theory for the long - time behavior of smooth densities , for which all moments are finite , and establish a unification of the previously proposed universality classes in the finite volume case .",
    "next we demonstrate , on the hand of exact result for a variety of different passive and driven diffusion processes , the existence of a universal proximity effect in the presence of a time - scale separation between direct and indirect trajectories .",
    "next , we discuss the biophysical implications of these results in the context of transcription regulation . we conclude with a summary of our results and offer a perspective on the importance of our results for future studies .",
    "to address the problem in the most general setting we impose only mild constraints , which are warranted by the physical setting : we assume the finiteness of the moments @xmath4 of the fpt density .",
    "this means that the dynamics has a finite natural time - scale , as expected in a finite volume .",
    "then the laplace transform of the fpt density , @xmath5 $ ] , of a particle starting at position @xmath6 to arrive at the target at @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "s1 ) , admits a moment expansion @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , it has the following representation in the form of a quotient of convergent power series @xmath9 ( see s1 in supplementary information , si ) , where the superscript @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11th derivative with respect to @xmath12 evaluated at @xmath13 @xcite . here ,",
    "we limit the discussion to hyper - spherically symmetric markov systems but our general result can be readily applied to any geometry given the knowledge of @xmath14 . by cauchy",
    "s theorem the asymptotic behavior of @xmath15 is determined by the root of @xmath16 which is closest to the origin at @xmath13 .    in a confined domain",
    "the transport operator @xmath17 for such dynamics has a discrete , real and non - degenerate eigenvalue spectrum @xmath18 with eigenvectors @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 for all @xmath21 due to the absorbing boundary @xcite . the long - time behavior of @xmath15 is determined in terms of the lowest eigenpair @xmath22 : @xmath23 , where the constant @xmath24 takes into account the specific properties of the given system and @xmath25 denotes asymptotic equality .    by necessity @xmath26",
    "is a simple pole . to find it , we must invert @xmath16 in the vicinity of @xmath27 for negative real @xmath12 . as long as @xmath28 does not have a branch cut along the negative real axis  an assumption , which is confirmed below ",
    "this can be done exactly in the form of a newton series ( for details see si - s2 ) .",
    "the first step of this procedure consists of obtaining the solution @xmath29 of the non - linear equation @xmath30 .",
    "the exact result is given by the newton series ( see si - s2 ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is an almost triangular square matrix with elements @xmath33.\\ ] ] here @xmath34 is the discrete heaviside step function and we use the symbolic convention @xmath35 ( see also si , eq .",

    "is generally rapidly converging , e.g. for 1-dimensional brownian motion it converges to within @xmath36%  of the known result @xmath37 @xcite already at @xmath38 .",
    "as long as the particle is not strongly biased towards the target , in which case @xmath39 , as @xmath15 tends to a delta function , @xmath40 terms are typically sufficient to achieve convergence to numerical precision .",

    "now it is essentially straightforward to invert the laplace transform using cauchy s theorem to obtain the exact long - time behavior of the fpt density ( for a detailed proof see si - s2 ) .",
    "the result reads @xmath46(-\\lambda_0)^l } { \\sum_{l=0}^{k-1}\\sum_{m=1}^{k - l}\\frac{1}{(l+m)!}h^{(l+m)}(-\\lambda_0)^{l+m-1}}\\mathrm{e}^{-\\lambda_0t}.\\ ] ]    note that the moments @xmath45 can be obtained recursively from the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 and vice versa ( see eq .  ( s2 ) in si - s1 for details ) .",
    "( [ exact ] ) to ( [ theorem ] ) are our first main result .",
    "these expressions are important as they enable us to obtain the exact long - time behavior of any smooth density , which has an exponential asymptotic decay .",
    "( [ exact ] ) and ( [ theorem ] ) are _ universal _ in the sense that the obtained asymptotic exponential decay holds for any first passage process with a smooth density , for which all @xmath49 .",
    "note that they also hold irrespective of the initial distance to the target .",
    "namely , while in general the laplace transform of some arbitrary asymptotically exponential density @xmath28 may display multi - scaling with respect to @xmath12 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , smoothness and finiteness of @xmath50 assure exactly the validity of the power series in eq .",
    "( s1 ) at least in the domain @xmath51 for some real @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "this satisfies the requirements for the above result to apply .",
    "our general result should therefore also apply to non - markovian dynamics as soon as all moments of the fpt density are finite . however , while results for the mean fpt for a broad class of gaussian non - markovian processes in bounded domains were obtained recently in @xcite and it is also known that a specific class of confined gaussian non - markovian processes indeed has exponential long - time asymptotics @xcite , the properties of higher moments and the long - time asymptotics of fpt density for a general non - markovian processes remain elusive .      to first demonstrate the universality implied by eq .",
    "( [ theorem ] ) we analyze the fpt behavior in a broad variety of spatially confined systems , in which the stochastic dynamics ranges from compact to non - compact cases , and we also consider diffusion in external fields .",
    "specifically , we study unbiased diffusion in hyper - spherical domains in the presence of a centered absorbing target in dimensions @xmath53 . as an extension to brownian motion",
    "we also examine diffusion in disordered media and fractals with fractal dimension @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "thus we analyze the scaling limit of a markovian random walk , whose mean squared displacement scales as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the random walk dimension and @xmath57 describes subdiffusive motion @xcite .",
    "the various different regimes of the fpt behavior are captured by the parameter @xmath58 . among biased diffusion processes we analyze @xmath59-dimensional diffusion in a linear potential ( taylor dispersion ) @xcite , @xmath60-dimensional diffusion in a radial potential flow @xcite and the kramer s escape of an overdamped particle from a harmonic potential @xcite .",
    "particle - based computer simulations are carried out to corroborate the analytical results .",
    "passive diffusion and @xmath60-dimensional radially biased diffusion is simulated in terms of the ( squared ) bessel process with parameter @xmath61 by numerically integrating the ito stochastic equation @xmath62 with zero mean gaussian white noise of variance @xmath63 up to the fpt @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "biased @xmath59-dimensional diffusion and the kramer s escape from a parabolic potential are simulated by numerically integrating the ito stochastic equations : @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "@xmath59-@xmath67 realizations were taken to measure @xmath15 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ theorem ] ) the fpt densities for these fundamentally different processes should collapse , after rescaling , to the asymptotic unit exponential @xmath68 where @xmath69 represents the prefactor in . in excellent agreement ,",
    "[ collapse ] demonstrates that the rescaled fpt densities indeed collapse to a master curve at long times for all processes considered here .",
    "note the excellent agreement of the data with the predicted single - exponential therefore , the long - time behavior of all first passage processes with finite moments unifies in a single universality class  the family of exponential densities . how can this be reconciled with the two different universality classes obtained in ref .",
    "the solution of this seeming contradiction lies in the exact way the limits are taken , as we detail now .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors considered passive markovian diffusion in a ( generally fractal ) medium with ( fractal ) dimension @xmath54 in a _",
    "large volume limit _ of the confining domain . since",
    "such markovian diffusion is self - similar in arbitrary dimension @xcite , the results are invariant with respect to the exact volume ( or equivalently , the radius of the domain @xmath70 ) if we express time in natural units @xmath71 , where we defined the ( generalized ) diffusion coefficient @xmath72 .",
    "therefore we can , without any loss of generality , consider the problem in a domain of unit radius , and express spatial coordinates in units of @xmath70 ( see below for details of the transformation ) .",
    "in this invariant setting the large volume limit in ref .",
    "@xcite corresponds to the limit when the dimensionless target size @xmath7 tends to be very small .",
    "+ in a passive fractal medium the particle experiences the aforementioned effective , @xmath54- and @xmath73- dependent geometric outward radial bias ( called the centrifugal drift in @xcite ) .",
    "as we will show below , the mathematical origin for the different limiting behaviors with respect to @xmath54 and @xmath73 found in @xcite is actually rooted in the fact , that the limit @xmath74 corresponds to a singular perturbation in the case of non - compact exploration , but merely to a change of the time unit for compact exploration .",
    "mathematically , the limit of a large volume thus has a different meaning for compact and non - compact exploration .",
    "another important point in this context follows from the exact limiting behavior of the coefficients @xmath48 and the rate of convergence of the newton series ( [ exact ] ) when the effective potential experienced by the searching particle in the vicinity of the absorbing target ( originating either from an external force or from the geometric spurious drift in the radial direction ) becomes sufficiently repulsive , such that at least locally in the vicinity of the target the motion is effectively non - recurrent . as we prove below , in this limit already the first correction @xmath75 to the leading order behavior in eq .",
    "( [ first ] ) converges uniformly to @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ theorem ] ) converges with the first term , and eq .",
    "( [ theorem ] ) reduces to @xmath76 here @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the mean fpt from the initial location @xmath6 and the location @xmath79 of the potential minimum .",
    "if the potential is monotonic or when the bias has a geometric origin then @xmath79 corresponds to the location of the confining boundary .    in the limit @xmath74",
    "this effective bias becomes sufficiently large for @xmath80 ( i.e. for so - called non - compact spatial exploration @xcite ) and leads to eq .",
    "( [ general])the emergence of poisson - like asymptotics ( for details , explicit results and proofs see below and si - s3 ) .",
    "in contrast , as we show below in the case of compact exploration , i.e. , @xmath81 , the coefficients @xmath48 become independent of @xmath7 in the limit @xmath74 as the effective outward bias vanishes . as a result ,",
    "higher order terms in eq .",
    "( [ exact ] ) need to be considered as well .",
    "therefore , the long - time behavior of the fpt density for diffusion in generally fractal media in fact falls into a single universality class , i.e. it can be described by the single universal equation ( [ theorem ] ) .",
    "it is only the behavior of the coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ exact ] ) to ( [ theorem ] ) , which in the limit of a vanishing target ( or large volume , in the language of @xcite ) depends on the compactness of the exploration of space .",
    "in fact one can check , by a suitable identification of parameters and a corresponding change of units , that our single universal result reproduces both qualitative regimes of the limiting long - time behavior found in @xcite . in that sense our results in eqs .",
    "( [ exact ] ) to ( [ theorem ] ) fully corroborate and unify the findings in ref .",
    "in addition , we here present the exact forms of the short- and intermediate - time fpt behavior .    here",
    "we generalize the cases considered in @xcite and demonstrate explicitly that the single universal result also captures diffusion in external fields .",
    "in addition , we prove the reduction of eq .",
    "( [ theorem ] ) to the poisson - like behavior ( [ general ] ) for a sufficiently strong locally repulsive potential . an important point we will make",
    "is that in all these cases the long - time behavior is in fact insufficient to describe and explain the _ kinetics in the few - encounter regime _",
    ", such as those occurring in gene regulation , and that the cognizance of the full fpt distribution @xmath15 is needed to quantitatively understand the system .",
    "as we will show later on , the long - time behavior of @xmath15 is not sufficient to explain the proximity effect .",
    "note that even the emergence of poisson - like asymptotics in eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) in general does not imply an existence of a single time scale in the kinetics . in the presence of a time - scale separation between direct and reflected indirect trajectories ( fig .",
    "[ classes]c ) proximity effects emerge for biased as well as for compact and non - compact passive motion .",
    "in contrast to the long - time asymptotic , the short - time behavior of @xmath15 , involving the direct trajectories from the initial position towards the target which do not feel the presence of the confinement , shows no such universality . while it contains in all the studied cases the lvy - smirnov density @xmath82 describing trajectories propagating directly towards the target , in general this expression",
    "is multiplied by a non - universal prefactor and potentially also a @xmath83-dependent function ( see below ) .",
    "the behavior in eq .",
    "( [ lsmirn ] ) is generally known as the sparre andersen result and describes the universal behavior of the free - space fpt statistics of 1-dimensional markov processes with symmetric steps @xcite and thus even holds for lvy flights with a diverging variance of the step length @xcite .",
    "depending on the initial distance to the target , there also exists an intermediate power - law regime corresponding to trajectories which make a brief excursion away from the target .",
    "the range of validity is strongly parameter and system - dependent , but the resulting proximity effect is universal .",
    "we now address the aforementioned specific systems explicitly .",
    "the practical consequences of the proximity effect for gene regulation are discussed in the last subsection .",
    "we focus first on the unbiased diffusion of a particle in a hyperspherically symmetric domain of radius @xmath70 and a perfectly absorbing target with radius @xmath84 in the center . in our discussion",
    "we also include the case of subdiffusion and consider the possibility of a fractal medium with fractal dimension @xmath54 @xcite . for this model the qualitative regimes of the fpt behavior",
    "are captured by the single parameter @xmath58 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ sh_fract ] ) to ( [ expo ] ) as well as si - s3 ) .",
    "if we limit ourselves to embedding dimensions @xmath85 and recall that @xmath56 and @xmath86 , the possible values of @xmath61 fall in the interval spanned between @xmath87- and @xmath59-dimensional brownian motion and hence @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , the size @xmath70 of the confining domain factors out , as it merely sets the characteristic diffusion time @xmath71",

    "our rigorous results provide a general method to determine the exact long - time behavior of a smooth one - sided probability density with finite moments from its laplace transform .",
    "they extend the existing generic asymptotic inversion methods , such as tauberian theorems for slowly varying functions , to functions varying exponentially fast at long times . here",
    "this new method enabled us to unify the first passage time statistics of all fpt densities with asymptotic exponential decay , both passive as well as those under the influence of a deterministic bias , into a single universality class .",
    "moreover , they provided a deep physical insight into the general effects of ( non)recurrent spatial exploration on the fpt behavior , and highlighted the qualitatively very different meaning of assuming a large volume or a small target size . beyond the theoretical advance",
    "our results are directly relevant in a biophysical context .",
    "thus , modern experimental methods allow the observation of individual molecular regulation events .",
    "it is therefore timely to extend the classical vista of mean rate approaches to biochemical kinetics and consider the full distribution of fpts @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results presented here will be a quantitative basis for the development and analysis of massive single - molecule experiments for fpt dynamics in living cells or chemical reactions in micro- and nano - containers .",

    "latter regimes we fully corroborate the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular , the observation that the initial distance to the target will be critically more important for compact exploration .",
    "our results have immediate consequences for the interpretation of single - molecule reaction or binding experiments ( e.g. @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) , that nowadays allow one to directly visualize the few - encounter regime .",
    "namely , the quantification of reaction kinetics is paradigmatically reduced to the mean fpt @xcite , which is meaningful if we are interested in systems , in which most of the molecules are required to react .",
    "in contrast , when only a small number of reactive encounters are required , e.g. the binding of a few tfs to their targets deciding the regulatory pathway of a cell @xcite or phosphorylation cascades in cellular signal - transduction propagating towards the nucleus @xcite , our results show that typical and direct realizations are essential . in this few - encounter regime , mean fpt - based concepts grossly underestimate the speed and precision of experimentally observed signaling kinetics , and would thus lead to severe parameter misjudgments .",
    "these would deteriorate further for fpt cascades .",
    "in other words , the notion of a kinetic rate in the traditional bulk sense ceases to exist in the few - encounters regime .",
