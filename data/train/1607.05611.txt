    "magnetic reconnection is the fundamental plasma process where a change in magnetic topology facilitates the conversion of magnetic energy to plasma kinetic energy and heat .",
    "it plays a fundamental role in causing eruptions in the coronae of the sun and other stars , in the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetospheres of earth and other planets , for confinement in toroidal fusion devices , and in a large collection of astrophysical settings @xcite",
    ".    there has been increased interest in the properties of reconnection in realistic systems going beyond the simplifying assumptions of the sweet - parker model @xcite . in this classical model ,",
    "the magnetic fields , densities , and temperatures are equal on either side of the reconnection site , and the upstream plasmas has no bulk flow other than the inflow in the reference frame of the reconnection site .",
    "one example of going beyond this model is to allow asymmetries in the reconnecting magnetic fields , densities and temperatures on either side of the reconnecting current sheet .",
    "a second example is including the effect of a bulk flow in the upstream plasma , whether in the direction of the reconnecting magnetic field or out of the reconnection plane .    understanding how these effects impact the reconnection process , both quantitatively and qualitatively , is often of great importance for applying our understanding of reconnection to real systems .",
    "one example is reconnection at the dayside magnetopauses of earth and other planets .",
    "the plasmas at the magnetopauses of earth @xcite and mercury @xcite differ on the two sides and the solar wind drives a bulk flow in earth s magnetosheath @xcite and undoubtedly does at mercury s , as well .",
    "when the interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) is northward , the magnetosheath flow is parallel / anti - parallel to the reconnecting magnetic field in the polar regions .",
    "when the imf is southward , magnetosheath flow at the flanks is mostly out of the reconnection plane .",
    "the effect of upstream bulk flow is even more dramatic at the magnetospheres of jupiter and saturn , where rotation of the magnetosphere is much stronger of an effect than at earth @xcite .",
    "a second example where upstream asymmetries and bulk flow are important is in tokamaks .",
    "the density and temperature profiles are peaked in the plasma core with a spatially varying magnetic field , so the plasma profiles at the reconnection site are non - uniform @xcite .",
    "further , there are often bulk flows causing the toroidal and poloidal rotation of the plasma @xcite , especially those driven by neutral beam injection .",
    "therefore , both asymmetries and flows effects are present and are important to the dynamics in magnetospheres and tokamaks .",
    "while the effect of asymmetries and flow shear have separately received much attention @xcite , only a few studies have treated systems that simultaneously contain both effects .",
    "studies of the shock structure far downstream of the reconnection site were carried out analytically @xcite and using magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) modeling @xcite .",
    "particle - in - cell simulations were used to study systems simultaneously including asymmetries , flow shear , and an out - of - plane ( guide ) magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the flow shear and diamagnetic drifts set up with the pressure gradient and the guide field can either reinforce or counteract each other .",
    "more recently , a scaling analysis for systems including both asymmetries and upstream flow in the reconnection plane was performed @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the reconnection site ( the x - line ) typically convects in the outflow direction .",
    "the convection speed of the x - line and the rate of reconnection was predicted as a function of arbitrary upstream plasma parameters for isolated systems ; the results will be reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] . in symmetric",
    "reconnection with a flow shear , reconnection does not occur if the flow is super - alfvnic because the tension in the reconnecting magnetic field can not overcome the energy of the flow @xcite .",
    "there is also a critical flow speed above which reconnection does not occur for asymmetric reconnection ; a generalization of the symmetric result for the asymmetric case was also derived @xcite .",
    "these predictions were successfully tested with two - dimensional numerical simulations using the two - fluid model ( mhd with the hall term and electron inertia ) .",
    "however , it is known that the fluid model is not well - suited to describe systems with asymmetric density and temperature as the fluids do not mix in the absence of thermal conduction @xcite ; even if conduction is present , the fluid model may not faithfully describe mixing in a nearly collisionless plasma as is the case in many applications .",
    "these shortcomings are not present in kinetic simulations , such as the particle - in - cell numerical technique @xcite where macro - particles are evolved in time and plasma mixing naturally occurs .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate the scaling of the reconnection rate and the drift speed of isolated x - lines within a fully kinetic model .    in this study , we perform a systematic numerical study of magnetic reconnection with asymmetries and in - plane upstream flow using the particle - in - cell ( pic ) technique .",
    "we measure relevant quantities in independent simulations in which all quantities are held fixed other than the upstream flow .",
    "we find that the theoretical predictions previously tested in fluid simulations @xcite are consistent with the results of the pic simulations .    in sec .",

    "equation  ( [ eqn::drift_eqn ] ) was derived using conservation of momentum in the @xmath6 direction into and out of the dissipation region .",

    "the key is that the significant increase in upstream flow speed only slightly impacts the reconnection rate , as predicted for reconnection in systems with a strongly asymmetric density @xcite .    as a test of the prediction for the cutoff flow shear speed to shut off asymmetric reconnection , we report results from simulations beyond the predicted cessation conditions .",

    "the predictions are that the x - line will drift with the common upstream drift speed and the reconnection rate is the same as if there was no flow .",
    "as shown in table  [ table::runs ] , this is borne out in the simulations . in summary ,",
    "the simulation results agree quite well with the predictions discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] .",
    "we use particle - in - cell simulations to study the scaling of 2d asymmetric anti - parallel reconnection with an in - plane upstream flow .",
    "the particle - in - cell approach is necessary to faithfully capture the effect of plasma mixing between the two disparate plasmas in the exhaust region , which is not well - described in the fluid description .",
    "we find very good agreement with the scaling predictions as a function of upstream plasma parameters for the drift speed of the x - line , the reconnection rate , and the critical upstream flow speed necessary to suppress reconnection found in a recent study @xcite .",
    "one area in which this study goes beyond the previous fluid simulation study is by testing the theory for systems in which the flow is in the same direction on each upstream side , which has been studied for solar wind applications @xcite .",
    "the results confirm the theory @xcite works in this case as well , and in particular confirms that the figure of merit is @xmath92 .",
    "physically , for a case with @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the same direction , the upstream plasma on both sides enter the diffusion region with momentum in the direction of the reconnecting field , and this momentum makes the x - line convect at the weighted average of the two speeds . in the special case of equal flows on the two sides , the upstream plasmas are stationary in the reference frame of the x - line , so there is no effect on the reconnection rate .",
    "this reveals that reconnection in the solar wind should not be suppressed by flow shear , which is consistent with the observation of active reconnection in the solar wind @xcite .    a important consideration before applying the results here to naturally occurring reconnection or reconnection in the laboratory is that the x - lines in question must be `` isolated '' in the sense that they are free to convect in the external flow for the theory to apply .",
    "this is essentially satisfied in the solar wind , for example , and may also be the case for neoclassical tearing modes ( ntms ) in tokamaks .",
    "however , for the magnetopause of earth and other planets , one should proceed with caution .",
    "a primary x - line is undoubtedly controlled by global considerations such as being line - tied to the ionosphere . therefore , it is not clear if a single x - line would follow the predictions of the theory tested here .",
    "however , a flux rope or flux transfer event ( fte ) @xcite could be considered isolated , so the theory may apply .",
    "there are differences between the predictions tested here and the leading model of open flux ( _ i.e. _ , fte ) motion @xcite , so future work on this topic would be interesting .",
    "an area of potential interest for future study are the properties of the system in regimes where the flow is higher than the cessation condition . in our simulations ,",
    "the current sheet contorts as if beginning to undergo kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "then , reconnection as a secondary process on the bent current sheets begins .",
    "the current sheets flatten and reconnect robustly .",
    "it is not clear whether this is physical or only a function of the finite system size in the simulations , so it is worth future study .",
    "we point out that a limit with such strong flows is not likely to apply at the magnetosphere except possibly when the reconnection site interacts with the dense , cold plasmas in plasmaspheric drainage plumes @xcite , but may be important in tokamaks .",
    "one limitation of this study is that it is in 2d .",
    "any 3d dynamics , including drift waves set up with wave vector in the out - of - plane direction due to the in - plane pressure asymmetry being normal to the reconnecting magnetic field , are artificially suppressed in 2d .",
    "it is not expected drift waves will change the bulk properties of the reconnection , but this is worth future study .",
    "another limitation of the present study is that it does not take into account an out - of - plane component of bulk flow velocity or an out - of - plane ( guide ) magnetic field .",
    "it is known that diamagnetic effects arise in systems with a guide field and a pressure asymmetry @xcite , and that the effects of flow shear and diamagnetic drifts compound @xcite .",
