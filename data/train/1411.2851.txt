    "the introduction of reflective optical elements revolutionized the design and imaging capabilities of telescopes @xcite . while the possibility of creating large diameter objectives was one of the primary aims ,",
    "a significant advantage is that reflective optical elements provide a means of reducing or eliminating the spherical and chromatic aberrations that are inherent in lens  based systems .    here",
    "we explore the opposite extreme of microfabricated optics .",
    "microfabricated optical elements are key components for the development and integration of optics into a range of research and commercial areas @xcite . to date , the majority of the work in microphotonics has been in refractive elements , i.e. microlenses .",
    "however , in this regime microlenses typically have significant numerical apertures and surface curvatures , which introduce large aberrations .",
    "a number of groups have in recent years discussed the design and fabrication of concave micromirrors @xcite .",
    "these examinations are largely driven by two purposes ; for optical tweezing , and for integration into atom optics .",
    "spherical mirrors have been demonstrated to collect light from single ions @xcite .",
    "parabolic mirrors , similar to those described here but with larger length scales , have been also been used as highly efficient collectors of light from single ions @xcite , atoms @xcite , and point sources @xcite . in a similar manner",
    "they may be used to tightly focus light onto atomic samples , which has to date been shown with refractive optics @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the use of reflective micro  optical components for focusing light .",
    "we present the construction and optical characterization of parabolic reflectors with an open aperture of radius 10  @xmath0 m and measured focal lengths that range from 24  @xmath0 m to 36  @xmath0 m .",
    "detailed mapping of the focused intensity field is made possible by the development of a previously  unreported adaptation of a confocal microscope that allows the illumination of the reflector with collimated light , while still maintaining the highly - desirable large - numerical - aperture confocal collection . using this device",
    "we obtain 3d data about the focal plane demonstrating diffraction limited focussing .",
    "we also discuss the application of the parabolic mirror for use in atomic physics and tweezing experiments .",
    "the details of the fabrication of concave paraboloid structures through ion - beam milling are covered in @xcite . briefly , a focused ion - beam ( gallium ions with typical currents of 50 - 300  pa and accelerating voltages of 30  kv ) is used to precisely sculpt a silicon substrate with the required mirror profile , which is subsequently coated with gold to provide a highly - reflective coating . in focused ion - beam milling , controlling the dose of ions to which an area is exposed allows a region of the surface to be sputtered to a known depth , due to a linear relationship between depth and dose in silicon . the applied dose is a function of the beam current , the dwell time , and number of passes the beam makes over an area . by tracing a number of concentric discs of increasing radius , whilst linearly increasing the dose , a parabolic depression can be milled into the substrate . in principle",
    "this would create a stepped contour , however due to edge - effects of the milling process , as well as redistribution of etched material , a larger number of passes creates a smooth contour of the parabolic dish .",
    "further details of the construction and characterization can be found in @xcite , where an rms roughness of 4.0  nm was measured by afm over the range of the concave parabolic surface . due to the identical manufacturing process",
    "similar values are expected in this work .",
    "the propagation of light using microscopic optical elements is a well represented topic in the literature . here",
    "we restrict our discussion to the behavior of light fields after wavelength ",
    "scale apertures and curved surfaces . in their work , goldwin and",
    "hinds @xcite derive analytic results for spherical mirrors , which they further compare with numerical integration of maxwell s equations .",
    "meanwhile , bandi _ et .",
    "_ consider the propagation of light after a wavelength - scale aperture using a fresnel representation of the fields @xcite , which offers the possibility of adding focusing to the formalism .        here",
    ", however , the reflected field was modeled using the angular spectrum method @xcite , which provides a mapping of an electric field from a particular plane into a secondary plane ; @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the cartesian spatial directions , @xmath4 is the wavevector in the @xmath5-direction , @xmath6 is the electric field , and @xmath7 is the 2d fourier spectrum of the electric field in the plane @xmath8 . the result of this compact equation can be understood by first noting that the spatial spectrum of an electric field , @xmath9 can be translated from a plane @xmath10 to another plane @xmath8 using the helmholtz propagator , @xmath11 where the helmholtz propagator in reciprocal space is @xmath12 , @xcite .",
    "we then note that the electric field can be calculated from its spatial spectrum in a plane are by the inverse fourier transform , @xmath13 , @xmath14 these relations , eq .",
    "( 2 ) and eq .",
    "( 3 ) then clearly show the result of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , and can be used to calculate the electric field in an arbitrary plane , given that is is known in one plane .",
    "the essential details of calculating the final intensity profile using the angular spectrum method can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : theory_schematic](c ) ; the initial electric field is fourier transformed , the helmholtz propagator is then applied , before the inverse fourier spectrum is taken . finally , the resulting intensity field is found from the modulus - squared of the electric field .",
    "example codes are available on request from the corresponding author .    for this work , in the plane of @xmath10",
    "a curvature is numerically added to the phase - fronts within the area of the aperture of the mirror .",
    "the curvature is expressed as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the total wavevector , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the radial distance from the center of the mirror , @xmath19 is the mirror aperture radius , and @xmath20 is the focal length .",
    "this modification of the optical wavefront represents the position dependent optical path - length difference , due to the spatially varying propagation distance to the metal surface , fig .",
    "[ fig : theory_schematic ] .",
    "care must be taken to include all modes of the field , including the evanescent ones , in order to return the full field simulation .",
    "all simulations were performed in matlab with the focal length , @xmath20 and the position of the surface as free parameters for fitting to the measured data .",
    "although transmission confocal imaging provides a powerful means of examining microlenses @xcite , reflection images of focusing elements require post analysis to interpret the data . in traditional reflection",
    "confocal microscopy the illuminating laser is focused onto the imaging plane at a point that is confocal with a pinhole in the imaging axis of the microscope .",
    "while this allows accurate probing of the surface it precludes imaging the focal plane of our concave mirrors directly .",
    "instead one may directly image about the center of curvature of the mirror and then infer the transfer function of the mirror assuming the point spread functions of the other optical elements are known . in this work",
    "we devise a scheme that allows interrogation of the focus while illuminating a mirror with a collimated laser beam , fig .",
    "[ fig : confocal_schematic ] .",
    "this arrangement means that the intensity distribution that would be formed in an optical tweezing experiment @xcite , for example , can be faithfully interrogated .",
    "probing the focal plane of the parabolic mirrors requires illumination with collimated light co  axial with the mirror axis ( orthogonal to the substrate surface ) .",
    "the working distance of the objective lens used ( olympus uplansapo 40x/0.9@xmath21 ) is only 180  @xmath0 m , which severely limits introducing further optical elements before the object . to circumvent these restrictions a non - polarizing beam splitter ( npbs )",
    "was introduced between the objective lens and the scanning column of a commercial confocal microscope ( olympus fv1000 scan head with olympus ix81 inverted microscope ) .",
    "this enabled an external probe beam to be introduced through the back aperture of the objective lens using the npbs to combine the beam into the imaging axis , see fig .",
    "[ fig : confocal_schematic ] .",
    "the probe , a commercial solid - state 589  nm laser ( based on sum - frequency generation using two lasing lines of an nd : yag laser ) , was focused , after fiber - coupling to clean up the spatial mode , at the back - focal plane of the objective lens .",
    "the specific probe wavelength was chosen for convenience ( good detector efficiency and high optical power in a single transverse mode ) - the numerical simulations were also conducted for this wavelength to account for wavelength - dependent diffraction effects .",
    "the collimation of the beam emitted was optimized by varying the axial position of the coupling lens .",
    "the npbs , optical fiber , and coupling lens were mounted in a holder with three  axis adjustment , which allowed for overlapping of the optical axes .",
    "the emitted beam had a diameter of 1  mm , justifying the assumption of a spatially uniform intensity profile across the micromirror aperture ( 20  @xmath0 m diameter ) .",
    "the magnification of the combined optical system was calibrated by measuring the aperture diameter of the mirrors .    in order to visually verify the surface quality of the mirrors , as well as to measure the aperture diameter of the mirrors the surface of the mirrors",

    "the raw data were then radially averaged about the optical axis of the beam .",
    "the optical axis was independently found by fitting a 2d gaussian to individual scans near the focal plane and then linearly extrapolating the center  of  mass fits to regions where a simple 2d - gaussian fit was not valid , _",

    "the trap depth would scale at least with the square of the aperture of the mirrors ( the power captured scales as the aperture diameter squared , while the peak intensity increases with the numerical aperture ) meaning that deeper traps could readily be designed .",
    "two dimensional arrays of single trapped atoms could be formed from one laser beam illuminating a congruent 2d array of mirrors .",
