    "during its lifetime , the egret instrument on board the compton gamma ray observatory detected 170 gamma - ray point sources which are not clearly identified with known objects at lower frequencies ( hartman et al .",
    "about a half of these sources are concentrated near the galactic plane , suggesting that they have a relatively local origin ( romero et al .",
    "1999a , gehrels et al . 2000 ) .",
    "different kinds of possible counterparts have been suggested for the galactic population of gamma - ray sources : supernova remnants ( snrs ) in interaction with molecular or atomic clouds ( e.g. sturner & dermer 1995 , esposito et al .",

    "recent variability analysis of the data in the third egret catalog by torres et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that many of the sources at low galactic latitudes display high levels of variability , confirming the results found by mclaughlin et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for the sources of the second egret catalog .",
    "the conjunction of steep gamma - ray spectral indices and strong variability in a few sources seems to suggest the existence of an entirely new population of high - energy sources in the galaxy .",
    "one of such sources is 3eg j1828 + 0142 , located at @xmath2 .",
    "hartman et al . ( 1999 ) suggest that it could be an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , although there is no strong radio blazar within the 95 % confidence contour .",
    "the source presents a steep spectral index with a value @xmath3 and variable gamma emission .",
    "if we introduce the variability index @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fluctuation index of the gamma - ray source and @xmath6 is the averaged fluctuation index of all known gamma - ray pulsars ( which are usually considered as a non - variable population ) , we found that @xmath7 , a clear indication of strong variability .    in this paper",
    "we propose that this source could be a magnetized black hole originated in a relatively recent supernova explosion .",
    "we have used background filtering techniques to isolate the radio image of an extended snr overlapped to the gamma - ray source from the contaminating diffuse emission of the galaxy in radio observations at two frequencies . both the variability and the steep spectral index of the gamma - ray radiation argue against the possibility that the compact object left after the explosion be a pulsar .",
    "we present a model for a magnetized black hole that can reproduce the observed high - energy spectrum and predicts an intense electron - positron annihilation line that could be detected in a couple of years by the spi spectrometer of the integral satellite .    in the next section",
    "we describe the data analysis technique .",
    "then , we present our results , briefly discuss the probability of a chance association of the snr and the gamma ray source , and outline the black hole model .",
    "finally , we discuss the predictions that can test our proposal .",
    "we have studied the surroundings of 3eg j1828 + 0142 using radio data from the surveys by haslam et al .",
    "( 1981 ) and reich & reich ( 1986 ) .",
    "the background filtering method developed by sofue & reich ( 1979 ) was applied to remove the diffuse galactic emission that hides weak and extended radio structures at low galactic latitudes .",
    "the procedure and its application to find low surface brightness snrs is described in detail by combi et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 ) . in the present case",
    "we have applied a gaussian filtering beam of @xmath8 to 0.408- and 1.42-ghz maps of a @xmath9 field around 3eg j1828 + 0142 , finding out a previously unnoticed shell - type structure centered at @xmath10 .",
    "it is a large ( @xmath11 ) source with a total flux density at 1.42 ghz of @xmath12 jy and a nonthermal spectral index @xmath13 , very similar to other shell - type snrs ( see green 1998 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , upper panel , we show the filtered 1.42-ghz image of the source .",
    "the large continuum sources at the south of the new remnant candidate are probably related to the north polar spur ( see jonas s 1999 large - scale map of the region at 2.326 ghz ) .",
    "table 1 lists the main characteristics of the new snr candidate .",
    "the distance of @xmath14 pc has been estimated using the @xmath15 relationship derived by allakhverdiyev et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for low surface brightness snrs , and it should be considered just as a very rough estimate . in any case , the large apparent size of the remnant suggests that it is nearby .    if we assume a standard energy release of @xmath16 erg for the supernova explosion and a typical intercloud density of @xmath17 @xmath18 for the interstellar medium ( spitzer 1998 ) , we get from the sedov solutions that the age of the remnant is @xmath19 yr . a transverse velocity of @xmath20 km s@xmath21 is then required for the compact object left by the explosion in order to be currently located near the outer boundary of the snr .",
    "a denser ambient medium would imply , of course , smaller velocities .",
    "for instance , with a density @xmath22 @xmath18 we get a more reasonable velocity of @xmath23 km s@xmath21 .",
    "it should be also taken into account that the determination of the distance has an uncertainty of @xmath24 % , so even lower velocities are possible .",

    "numerical simulations using large numbers of synthetic populations are then performed in order to determine the probabilities of pure chance associations . when generating synthetic populations of @xmath0-ray sources the distribution in galactic latitude is constrained to be the same as the one actually observed for the 3eg sources .",

    "we have extrapolated the isotropic population of already detected gamma - ray emitting agns towards the region obscured by the galactic disk emission , performing simulations with no gamma - ray source density gradient towards the plane .",
    "kerr - newman isolated black holes are interesting candidates to produce variable gamma - ray sources in the galaxy ( punsly 1998a , 1998b ) .",
    "the configuration of a simple axisymmetric magnetosphere around a maximally rotating black hole attains a minimum energy configuration when the hole and the magnetosphere have equal and opposite charge .",
    "punsly ( 1998a ) has shown that the magnetospheric charge can be supported in a stationary orbiting ring or disk .",
    "the entire magnetized system is stable only in an isolated environment , otherwise accretion onto the hole would disrupt the ring and its fields .",
    "kerr - newman black holes are charged similarly to neutron stars in pulsars .",
    "but unlike neutron stars , black holes have no solid surface and consequently no thermal x - ray emission is expected .",
    "these objects can support strong magnetized bipolar winds in the form of jets where gamma - ray emission is originated by the inverse compton mechanism ( punsly 1998a ) . since both magnetic and rotation axes are always aligned in them ,",
    "their emission is nonpulsating ( np ) and for such a reason they have been called np black holes ( punsly 1999 ) .",
    "we propose that 3eg j1828 + 0142 could be a np black hole created by the same supernova explosion that produced the nearby snr . in what follows we present a specific model that reproduces the steep gamma - ray spectrum observed at egret energies .",
    "the model takes into account electron - positron annihilations in the inner jet , self - compton cooling of the relativistic leptons , and synchrotron emission of the outer jet , in such a way that it provides concrete predictions for different wavebands that can be tested in the near future .",
    "we shall follow the treatment given by punsly ( 1998a ) , considering a black hole mass @xmath44 @xmath45 and a polar magnetic field strength @xmath46 g. the inner jet begins at the inner light cylinder ( located at a cylindrical radius @xmath47 from the symmetry axis ) : @xmath48 this is at a distance @xmath49 from the event horizon : @xmath50    the radius of the jet @xmath51 is given in terms of the axial displacement from the black hole , @xmath52 , as : @xmath53 thus , the inner jet is tightly collimated .",
    "its length is given by : @xmath54 the doppler enhancement factor is constant and assumed to be : @xmath55 the magnetic field and the particle number density vary with @xmath52 as : @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 the maximum thermal lorentz factor , @xmath59 , is : @xmath60    gamma - rays are produced in this inner jet by electron - positron annihilations and self - compton emission .",
    "the annihilation luminosity is enhanced by doppler boosting in the jet as : @xmath61 where @xmath62 \\label{ann}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( see roland & hermsen 1995 , noticing the wrong exponent in their eq .",
    "4 , where it should be no dependency on @xmath31 ) . in the above eq . ( [ ann ] ) , @xmath63 is the number density of electron - positron pairs , @xmath64 is the volume where the annihilations occur , and @xmath65 is the thomson cross section .",
    "the peak of the annihilation line will be at an energy : @xmath66 which in our model corresponds to 6.4 mev , assuming @xmath67 .",
    "the spectral shape of the annihilation line is as in bttcher & schlickeiser ( 1996 ) .",
    "notice , however , that these authors consider an external source of photons for the inverse compton radiation and , consequently , their conclusions on the minimum leptonic number density in the jet do not apply to our case .",
    "the outer jet , which is responsible for the bulk of the synchrotron emission , can be parameterized as a direct extrapolation of the inner jet :    @xmath68    @xmath69    @xmath70    @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    @xmath74    @xmath75    @xmath76    the bulk of the gamma - ray emission is originated in the inner jet .",
    "we have computed its emissivity using the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) formalism developed for agns by ghisellini , maraschi & treves ( 1985 ) and adapted to magnetized black holes by punsly ( 1998b ) . the computed spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "is shown in figure ( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "notice that the radio luminosity is low , so no strong point - like counterpart is expected at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "the radio jets and the terminal radio lobes should appear as a weak ( @xmath77 mjy at 5 ghz ) source with an angular size of a few arcseconds .",
    "any of the sources in table 2 , then , are potential counterparts .    at a few mev , the gamma - ray annihilation luminosity exceeds the ssc emission and the spectrum presents a broad peak .",
    "the pair annihilation contribution produces a steepening in the spectrum , which presents an index @xmath1 in the egret energy band , consistent with the observations .",
    "we have shown in the previous section that when electron - positron annihilation effects are taken into account in the bipolar magnetically dominated wind ejected by a kerr - newman black hole in isolation , a steep - spectrum gamma - ray source with no strong radio counterpart can be produced .",
    "the wind , which is tightly collimated into a jet , possibly experiences strong dissipation near the outer light cylinder ( i.e. at @xmath78 cm from the black hole ) due to plasma instabilities and shocks .",
    "these dissipative processes can load the jet with hot plasma .",
    "if the inner jet were to propagate with a bulk lorentz factor of 5 and were viewed at 20 degrees off the axis , a doppler factor of 2.5 would be attained as in eq .",
    "( [ delta ] ) .",
    "the jet is likely to wiggle either as a consequence of interactions with the enveloping medium or by firehose instabilities .",
    "if the jet were to wobble @xmath79 5 degrees from its nominal value of @xmath80 , then the gamma - ray luminosity would vary by a factor of 9 .",
    "thus , extreme variability is expected in our model .",
    "there are two main types of observations that could confirm in the immediate future our proposal on the nature of the source 3eg j1828 + 0142 .",
    "on the one hand , vlba observations of the sources in table 2 could reveal some structure unresolved in the vla images and show evidence of the twin jets and their end points in the ism , if there is a np black hole producing 3eg j1828 + 0142 . on the other hand , observations with the gamma - ray spectrometer spi in the forthcoming integral mission",
    "should clearly show evidence of the electron - positron annihilation line , which has an expected luminosity of @xmath81 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "x - ray observations with chandra observatory also could be very useful to identify the lower frequency counterpart of 3eg j1828 + 0142 .",
    "the expected luminosity of the np black hole in the chandra energy range is @xmath82 erg s@xmath21 , with a spectral index @xmath83 .",
    "it should appear as a point source positionally coincident with one of the nonthermal radio sources detected in the field .",
    "the fact that the point - like radio sources found within the inner confidence contour of the gamma - ray source have , in most cases , steeper spectral index than the canonical value of @xmath84 expected from the outer jet can be explain by the contribution from the two lobes of radio emission formed at the points where the outer jets end , approximately at 0.1 pc from the black hole .",
    "the emission from these lobes , which is not taken into account in the sed shown in figure [ fig2 ] , has been modeled by punsly ( 1998b ) .",
    "the radio spectrum from these regions is expected to be steeper than the emission from the jet , with values of @xmath85 at 1 ghz ( punsly 1998b ) .",
    "the recent variability analysis of the unidentified gamma - ray sources in the third egret catalog carried out by torres et al .",
    "( 2000 ) shows that the most variable sources near the galactic plane tend to present steep indices @xmath86 .",
    "the model presented here is capable of explaining the association of such indices with high levels of variability and absence of strong radio counterparts in a galactic source .",
    "the discovery of a nearby snr , also reported in this work , provides additional support to the idea of a young black hole behind the source detected by egret ."
