    "there is currently much interest in the qcd perturbative pomeron. this is the phenomenon , obtained by resumming a certain type of soft gluon emission to all orders in the leading logarithm approximation using the balitsky - kuraev - fadin - lipatov ( bfkl ) equation @xcite , which is supposed to produce a sharp rise at small @xmath1 in deep inelastic structure functions @xcite .",
    "recent measurements at hera @xcite may well show the first evidence for this behaviour , although it is premature to draw any definitive conclusions .",
    "one of the difficulties with extracting information on the perturbative pomeron from structure function measurements alone is that both perturbative and non - perturbative effects are very likely intertwined in a non - trivial way , and therefore obtaining information on the former requires some sort of model - dependent subtraction of the latter .",
    "for this reason , attempts have been made to find other quantities which probe more directly the perturbative behaviour . in the context of deep inelastic scattering",
    ", one can look for an associated jet of longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath2 and comparable transverse momentum to the virtual photon momentum @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the bfkl behaviour is then reflected in the growth of the cross section with @xmath4 . alternatively , mueller and navelet have shown @xcite that in high - energy hadron - hadron collisions one can utilize a two - jet inclusive cross section where the jets have small transverse momentum and a large relative rapidity , @xmath5 .",
    "the rise in the cross section with increasing @xmath5 is then controlled by the perturbative pomeron .",
    "it is this latter process that we investigate here .",
    "we first define the cross section introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and show why it is difficult to measure under present experimental conditions .",
    "we then consider an alternative but closely - related quantity , the azimuthal angle correlation between jets at large relative rapidity , which we argue is more promising from an experimental point of view .",
    "predictions are presented for the fermilab @xmath0 collider at @xmath6 .",
    "our results also apply to the corresponding two - jet cross section in deep inelastic scattering as measured at hera , although we shall not pursue this issue here .",
    "consider the inclusive two - jet cross section in @xmath0 ( or @xmath7 ) collisions at energy @xmath8 , where each jet has a minimum transverse momentum @xmath9 , and the jets are produced with equal and opposite large rapidity @xmath10 .",
    "adapting the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the cross section for this can be written in the form .",

    ", the subprocess cross section @xmath15 is expected to rise at large @xmath16 .",

    "this is the analogue of the expected @xmath18 growth of the @xmath19 structure function at small @xmath1 @xcite .    now with @xmath6 and @xmath20 ,",

    "the problem , however , is the additional @xmath21 dependence in the cross section induced by the @xmath1 dependence of the parton distributions in ( [ basic ] ) . at large @xmath16",
    ", the behaviour of the cross section will be completely dominated by the @xmath23 suppression of the parton distributions .",
    "this can only be avoided by increasing the energy @xmath8 of the collider as @xmath16 is increased , in such a way that @xmath24 and @xmath25 remain fixed , which is not an easy proposition in practice",
    ".    there are at least two ways around this difficulty .",
    "first , one could argue that the parton distributions at medium - to - large @xmath1 are now sufficiently well known that they can be factored out of the measured cross section with sufficient accuracy . while this might be true for the quark component of @xmath26 , the gluon component is much less well known at large @xmath1 .",
    "even if it was , there is still a problem with scale dependence  the cross section in ( [ basic ] ) is not known beyond leading logarithm accuracy , and so the choice of scale in the parton distributions is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "a second possibility is to use the distribution in the azimuthal angle difference between the two jets as a signature for bfkl behaviour .",
    "when @xmath16 is small , the cross section is dominated by the lowest order @xmath27 scattering subprocesses and the jets are back - to - back in the transverse plane",
    ". as @xmath16 increases , more and more soft gluons with transverse momentum @xmath28 are emitted in the rapidity interval between the two fast jets , and the azimuthal correlation is gradually lost until , asymptotically , there is no correlation at all .",
    "the change in the overall weighting , due to variations in the parton distributions as @xmath16 increases at fixed @xmath8 , has no effect on the shape of the azimuthal distribution .",
    "the study of the azimuthal correlation between the two jets at large rapidity is the subject of the present analysis .",
    "we first of all derive the basic formulae , which is an extension of the treatment in @xcite , and then make numerical predictions for experimentally measurable quantities .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the weakening of the correlation should already be observable at the fermilab @xmath0 collider .",
    "we start by considering the subprocess cross section for inclusive two - jet ( i.e. parton ) production .",
    "we are interested in jets produced with equal and opposite large longitudinal energy , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the parton beam energy in the parton - parton centre - of - mass , and small transverse momentum @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a fixed cut - off .",

    ", @xmath34 will be a number of order @xmath35 and the maximum value of @xmath30 is set by the kinematic limit @xmath36 .    at the fermilab collider ,",
    "a large fraction of such jet pairs are produced in gluon - gluon collisions , and so in what follows we focus on the subprocess @xmath37 .",

    "the approach to flatness ( @xmath142 ) is slower for the higher cut - off because of the smaller coupling constant .",
    "in this study we have focussed on two important aspects of bfkl perturbative pomeron behaviour .",
    "the first is the rise in the cross section as the rapidity gap between two moderate @xmath143 jets increases , as first discussed in ref .",
    "the difficulty with this signature is that in order to circumvent the additional dependence on rapidity induced by the parton distributions , it is necessary to scale up the collider energy as the rapidity gap increases . at fixed collider energy ,",
    "the dominant effect at large rapidity gap is the suppression of the cross section by the fall - off in the parton distributions as @xmath23 . after allowing for the effects of jet reconstruction and measurement in the detector ,",
    "it is not clear whether the relatively small effects of the bfkl behaviour can be observed .",
    "this is not , however , as severe a problem for the second important feature of the bfkl pomeron  the weakening of the correlation in the azimuthal angle of the two jets .",
    "the distribution in the azimuthal angle difference @xmath46 changes from being back - to - back for central jet pairs with a small rapidity difference , to an asympototically flat distribution as the jets separate in rapidity .",
    "we have presented predictions for the @xmath46 distribution at different rapidity gaps @xmath16 in @xmath102 collisions at @xmath6 , based on the fixed - coupling solutions of the bfkl equation . however , there are very likely non - negligible sub - leading corrections to this behaviour .",
    "we have investigated some of these by comparing the leading - logarithm predictions with those based on the exact low - order matrix elements . from this comparison",
    ", it seems that the leading behaviour may already be dominant for rapidity gaps as small as 4 .    of course , we have _ not _ included such important effects as smearing of the jet energies and angles by the jet algorithms used in the actual experiments .",
    "a more precise analysis would require a correspondong smearing of the @xmath46 distribution , which would inevitably weaken the correlations implied by perturbation theory alone .",
    "the size of this smearing could be estimated , for example , by comparing the actual @xmath46 distribution of two central jets  which should be well - described by lowest order perturbation theory  with the naive @xmath88 expectation .",
    "if the smearing was parametrizable by , say , a gaussian distribution , this could be folded in to the fourier coefficients in the perturbative predictions .",
    "we have not performed such an analysis here , since the form of the smearing is presumably detector and jet algorithm dependent .    in summary , therefore , it would be interesting to measure the azimuthal angle distribution of the two - jet inclusive cross section as a function of the jet rapidity gap , to see if the data are at least qualitatively in line with the flattening of the distribution predicted by the bfkl equation . in this study",
    "we have only considered the case of @xmath102 collisions at @xmath128 .",
    "however , basically the same behaviour should also be manifest in any high - energy collider with quarks and gluons in the initial state .",
    "in particular , photoproduction of jet pairs at hera could also be a useful place to look for evidence of the bfkl behaviour , and , of course , high - energy proton - proton colliders such as the lhc will allow a much larger range of rapidities to be covered .",
    "in this appendix , we present a brief derivation of the solution of the bfkl equation for the two - jet inclusive cross section .",
