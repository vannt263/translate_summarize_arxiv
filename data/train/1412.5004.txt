    "during deep sleep , neurons are highly synchronized , embedded in slow oscillations ( hence the name ` slow - wave sleep ' ) . in this period , most neurons of the cerebral cortex display an oscillatory behavior , generating bursts of spikes with a dominant rhythm of about 1 - 5hz ( 10.20s between bursts ) : the delta rhythm .",
    "this oscillation is highly synchronized among neurons in the cortex and other brain regions .",
    "because of this massive synchronization , the global electrical activity displays a high amplitude oscillation that can be easily observed in the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) as it shows larger amplitude and lower frequency waves than in the awake state ( steriade , mccormick and sejnowski , 1993 ) . under experimental conditions this global oscillatory activity",
    "can be induced by some anesthetics , giving rise to a sleep - like activity .",
    "this allows the study of the neuronal properties of the oscillatory phenomena from an electrophysiological point of view . during the awake state",
    "such global oscillatory synchronized activity does not exist , and neuronal spikes are not organized in repetitive bursts of activity , but follow what could be seen as a more random response , generating trains of spikes with different patterns and frequencies .",
    "this mode of operation is referred to as tonic activity , in contrast to the mentioned slow oscillatory activity ( of course , this tonic activity is not random , and is used to convey all kinds of information ) .",
    "+ the transition between the sleep and awake states is modulated by the so called ` activating ascending pathways ' which originate in neuronal nuclei located in the brain stem ( _ bs _ ) and basal forebrain ( _ bf _ ) .",
    "each activating pathway uses specific neurotransmitters , delivered through specific neural routes ( steriade , 1994 ; bazhenov et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "the experimental electrical stimulation of these nuclei can change the eeg pattern from the typical sleep - like pattern to the one expected in an awake individual .",
    "this happens because stimulation suppresses the slow oscillatory activity , and promotes a tonic mode of activity , thus introducing a tool to study the effects of the mechanisms that underlie the sleep - wake cycle ( hu et al .",
    ", 1989 ; burlet et al . , 2002 ; mario and cudeiro , 2003 ) .",
    "to study this process under controlled laboratory conditions , animals are anesthetized and the activating nuclei manipulated by means of electrical stimulation .",
    "some anesthetics induce a sleep - like state virtually identical to the natural one ; under this condition , the electrical stimulation of either the _ bs _ or the _ bf _ promotes a change in the global brain activity and , for a period of some seconds after the stimulation ( usually from 2 to 20s ) , the eeg shows an awake - like pattern .",
    "thus , it is possible to study the spontaneous synchronization dynamics during those states for the same pairs of neurons , and to look for subtle differences in the awake - like state induced by _",
    "bs _ and _ bf _ , but this requires a synchrony measure sensitive enough to deal with low spike activity , together with powerful statistical tests . + during sleep - like oscillatory periods ( either natural or induced by anesthesia ) the activity is dominated by the 15hz delta rhythm , in which the firing rate is mostly reduced to brief bursts of activity .",
    "there exists also an increase in alpha activity ( 812hz ) ( brown et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "spontaneous activity is usually characterized by low firing activity . under this condition",
    ", statistical analysis becomes difficult and therefore , in order to make inferences , special measures and appropriate statistical testing procedures are needed .",
    "the aforementioned experimental conditions permit the study of dynamic synchronization between pairs of neurons under two types of spontaneous activity : the anesthetic - induced sleep - like activity , and the electrically induced awake - like activity",
    ". the awake - like type of activity needs an initial electrical stimulus to be induced .",
    "afterwards , such mode of activity can last for tens of seconds .",
    "hence , we will consider both the sleep - like and the awake - like signals as periods of spontaneous activity . in any case , this is only a terminological issue that does not change at all the mathematical and statistical results and conclusions .",
    "+ cross - correlation analysis of simultaneously isolated single - neuron activities is a common procedure to study the degree of synchronization evoked under certain conditions , like sensory stimulation .",
    "those approaches are essential to study the information coding and functional organization of the brain , but the spontaneous spike activity can also provide important clues to brain structure and function .",
    "+ correlations between spike trains of neuron pairs can modulate neuronal activity and affect how neurons encode information .",
    "furthermore , sensory and cognitive processing relies on the concerted activity of large populations of neurons .",
    "for instance , in the visual system more information can be extracted from the activity of pairs of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus if correlations between their spikes are taken into account ( dan et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "however correlated neural activity and the correspondent pairwise correlation vary with a number of relevant factors such the firing rate ( de la rocha et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "it is well known that correlations in pairs of neurons that fire few spikes per trial are weaker than in pairs that respond more strongly ( cohen and kohn , 2011 ) .",
    "+ the aim of the present work is to develop statistical tools to study the synchronization strength between pairs of neurons during low firing rate conditions and , also , to discern subtle differences in synchronization during tonic activity . there exist in the literature diverse methods to measure neural synchrony .",
    "harrison , et al .",
    "2013 present a review on synchrony identification methods , including cross - correlation , joint peri - stimulus time histograms , trial - to - trial variability models , inhomogeneous poisson models and generalized regression models for synchronous activity .",
    "other include , the _ unitary - event analysis _ ( grn , 1996 ; grn , diesmann , and aertsen , 2002a , b ) , the _ conditional synchrony measure _ , proposed in faes et al . , ( 2008 ) , the _ event synchronization _ method , proposed in quian quiroga , kreuz and grassberg , ( 2002 ) or the _ cross - nearest spike interval based method _ proposed in gonzlez - montoro et al . , ( 2014 ) . in this occasion , we propose a cross - correlation based method referred to as cross - correlation synchrony index ( ccsi ) , in which the level of synchronization is measured as the area under the cross - correlation function in a neighborhood of zero with a correction for spurious coincidences . in general , synchrony measures are based in binned spike trains .",
    "when firing rates are low , bins need to be defined large enough in order to decrease the number of zeros in the sequence .",
    "this procedure derives in the loss of important information , the timing of events .",
    "the measure we use estimates the distribution of the distances between spikes of different neurons in a smooth fashion , making a more efficient use of the information .",
    "we also propose bootstrap methods for hypothesis testing .",
    "resampling and bootstrap methodology is being widely used to assess for statistical significance of spike correlations ( grn , 2009 ) and to conduct hypothesis tests in neuroscience in general ( kass , ventura , and brown , 2005 ) . a fundamental approach to synchrony in spike trains",
    "is the jitter method ( amarasingham et al . , 2012 ) .",
    "however , the jitter procedure , together with other resampling methodology , are thought to assess synchrony against background variability . in the present work ,",
    "special resampling methods are developed in order to imitate the existing associations between spike trains and conduct the bootstrap tests and , therefore , be able to test for differences in synchrony strength .",
    "experiments were carried out in adult anesthetized ( isoflurane ) and paralyzed ( gallamine ) cats .",
    "the end - tidal co2 , body temperature and heart rate were continuously monitored and maintained under stable conditions .",
    "the animals were suspended on a stereotaxic frame and four craniotomies were performed in order to insert the recording and stimulating electrodes .",
    "all the procedures were performed by the researchers of neurocom group and according to national and international guidelines . +",
    "two recording methods were used : 1 ) in order to assess the global cortical activity , an electrocorticogram ( ecog ) was obtained through a bipolar concentric electrode located in the primary somatosensory cortex ; and , 2 ) an eight - channel multielectrode ( fhc inc . ) was introduced into the primary visual cortex of the animal in order to make simultaneous extracellular recordings of several neurons .",
    "a guide - tube was used to arrange the tungsten electrodes in two rows and four columns , obtaining a grid of 8 recording points separated 200 microns and with independent vertical movement .",
    "concurrently , two bipolar electrodes ( tips separated 500 microns ) were introduced for electrical stimulation at _ bs _ and _ bf_. + using the multielectrode we recorded spontaneous sleep - like activity of groups of neurons ( 13 units by electrode ) for approximately 2 minutes .",
    "next , _ bs _ or _",
    "bf _ was stimulated for 24s ( pulse trains of 28v , up to 1.5ma , and 50hz ) to induce an awake - like state lasting for up to 20s , followed by an spontaneous and slow return to the sleep - like state .",
    "the whole procedure was repeated several times for each activating pathway . in the present work",
    "each of these recordings is called a trial .",
    "the ecog , spike waveforms and time stamps were conveniently filtered , digitized and stored for posterior analysis ( plexon inc , dallas , tx ) .",
    "spikes were isolated using a box sorter during the experiment and re - sorted manually using the principal components of their waveforms ( offline sorter , plexon , inc ) .",
    "thus , to define a single unit , first and second principal components had to be ( visually ) well separated from the projections of all other waveforms ( and noise ) recorded on the same electrode .",
    "let us consider two simultaneous spike trains , recorded in a @xmath0 seconds long time window around time @xmath1 .",
    "let us denote these spike trains by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , which we also call train 1 , and @xmath4 @xmath5 , also referred to as train 2 .",
    "these processes need not to be poisson processes .",
    "the only assumption we make is that the bivariate counting process associated to the simultaneously recorded spike trains , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , is stationary in the time period previous to the stimulus .",
    "we define @xmath8 as the probability that , given a spike in train @xmath6 , there is a synchronous spike in train @xmath7 . by _",
    "synchronous _ we mean that the two spikes occurred at the same time ( or approximately the same time , with , at most , a difference of @xmath9 ) due to the synchronous activity between the two neurons and not to chance .",
    "let us analogously define @xmath10 as the probability that , given a spike of train @xmath7 , there is a synchronous spike in train @xmath6 .",
    "the synchrony measure we propose is the geometric mean of these two probabilities : @xmath11 which is a joint measure of the probability of synchronous firing .",
    "note that , overall , @xmath12 is a standardized measure of the joint firing rate .",
    "let us denote by @xmath13 the normalized cross - correlation function for lags up to @xmath14 seconds .",
    "namely , @xmath13 is the density function of the distances between two spikes , one of each train , provided that that distance is smaller , in absolute value , than @xmath14 .",
    "we call @xmath15 the _ cross - correlation window_. to estimate @xmath12 we propose to approximate the area under @xmath13 in a neighborhood of zero while taking into account the amount of that area that is due to chance .",
    "let , @xmath16 and , to consider how much of @xmath17 corresponds to chance , we propose to subtract the following approximation of the average of @xmath18 , for @xmath19 $ ] , under no synchronous firing :    @xmath20    the proof of ( [ fact_corr ] ) can be found in appendix a. observe that both @xmath9 and @xmath21 are chosen regarding the problem and @xmath13 can be easily estimated with a normalized cross - correlogram or a kernel - smoothed version of it , which we denote by @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 can be estimated as the corresponding integral of @xmath22 , which we denote by @xmath24 .",
    "so , to begin with , we can define a synchrony measure as @xmath25    however , we aim to estimate @xmath26 .",
    "let us study @xmath27 in a little bit more detail .",
    "@xmath27 describes the probability that , given two spikes , one of each spike train , they are synchronous .",
    "this last probability is actually the expected proportion of synchronous pairs of spikes among all possible pairs of spikes observed in @xmath28 that are distant in less than @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath29 @xmath30 be the set of all possible differences between the spike times of one train and the spike times of the second one , which are , in absolute value , smaller than the cross - correlation window @xmath14 .",
    "so , as just mentioned , @xmath27 estimates the expected proportion :    @xmath31    now , for every spike of train 1 , the probability of finding a synchronous spike in train 2 was defined as @xmath8 , therefore , the expected number of synchronous pairs is @xmath32 . on the other hand , for every spike of train 2 ,",
    "the probability of finding a synchronous spike in train 1 was defined as @xmath10 and , therefore , the expected number of synchronous pairs is @xmath33 .",
    "these two last mentioned expected values should be equal and , consequently , @xmath34 which is the expected value of the numerator in ( [ a_tilde ] ) .",
    "+ on the other hand , the denominator in ( [ a_tilde ] ) is the expected total amount of pairs that differ in less than @xmath14 . for every spike observed in spike train 1 ,",
    "the expected number of spikes of train 2 that are closer than @xmath14 is @xmath35 as @xmath36 is the mean firing rate of train 2 in the window @xmath28 .",
    "then , in total , @xmath37 is the expected number of pairs of spikes that differ in less than @xmath14 .",
    "+ hence , @xmath27 is an estimator of @xmath38    this last expression suggest the definition of the estimator @xmath39 of @xmath12 , at time @xmath1 , as some corrected version of @xmath27 , that we will refer to as the cross - correlation synchrony index ( ccsi ) :    @xmath40    as already stated , we are interested in the time evolution of synchrony during the spontaneous sleep - like oscillatory activity and also during the awake - like tonic activity induced after electrical stimulation .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate time - varying synchrony we use moving windows of size @xmath0 and estimate @xmath12 in each window , obtaining @xmath41 .",
    "+      the number of spikes at each time window , @xmath43 , is very variable and when this number is small @xmath44 becomes less reliable . to make the ccsi more robust , in order to be able to highlight characteristics of these curves and find patterns due to experimental conditions , we use a kernel smoother of the form : @xmath45 for some weight functions @xmath46 .",
    "the most common kernel estimator is the nadaraya - watson estimator ( nadaraya , 1964 ; watson , 1964 ) , which is constructed using the weights    @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 a suitable kernel function . for our data",
    ", we used the uniform kernel function @xmath50 if @xmath51 and @xmath52 otherwise and the smoothing parameter @xmath53 .",
    "+      to check whether there are differences between the ccsi during the awake - like period and the ccsi during sleep - like spontaneous activity , a hypothesis test is implemented . as a result of the assumption that the bivariate process is stationary before the stimulus onset",
    ", the synchrony is constant during that time period , i.e. , @xmath54 for every @xmath55 , where @xmath56 denotes the time point where stimulation was applied .",
    "however , the synchrony needs not to be constant after the appearance of the stimulus .",
    "therefore , we aim to test whether the synchrony at two given points , @xmath57 and @xmath58 $ ] , is equal , or , equivalently , whether at time @xmath58 $ ] ( awake - like activity , after the stimulus ) the synchrony index has recovered its stationary sleep - like value . in this context , the null ( @xmath59 ) and alternative ( @xmath60 ) hypotheses can be stated as follows .",
    "for some fixed @xmath61 $ ] :    * @xmath62 * @xmath63 .",
    "the stationarity of the bivariate counting process in @xmath64 $ ] implies that the sampling distribution ( before the stimulus ) of the joint trains @xmath65 does not depend on @xmath1 . as a consequence , @xmath66 , and the sampling distribution of @xmath67",
    "do not depend on @xmath1 in the period previous to the stimulus .",
    "an important issue is , therefore , to approximate the probability distribution of the test statistic @xmath67 under the null hypothesis .",
    "we propose an extension of the stationary bootstrap ( politis and romano , 1994 ) to imitate the synchronous activity in the sleep - like time interval .",
    "politis and romano s stationary bootstrap is a resampling mechanism that mimics the underlying distribution of the stochastic process and also preserves stationarity .",
    "these two properties are preserved by our extension to a bivariate setting . since",
    ", stationarity implies constant synchrony , using the stationary bootstrap guarantees that the resampling distribution of , mimics the sampling distribution of under the null hypothesis , this is .",
    "the proposed procedure produces two synchronous bootstrap spike trains , which are then used to calculate bootstrap versions of under @xmath59 .",
    "the procedure can be described as follows : +    1 .",
    "merge the two trains into one but take note of which spike belonged to which original train , this is , label them .",
    "2 .   compute the inter spike intervals ( isi ) of this joint train .",
    "let us call this sequence of values @xmath68 .",
    "3 .   build @xmath69 and @xmath70 the sets of isi that start in a spike of neuron 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "4 .   choose at random one isi from @xmath68 .",
    "choose the following value in @xmath68 with probability @xmath71 .",
    "with probability @xmath72 choose an isi from the corresponding @xmath73 .",
    "this is , if the last spike came from spike train 1 then the next isi needs to be chosen from @xmath69 and from @xmath70 in the other case .",
    "repeat step 5 until obtaining enough resamples time to imitate the true sampling time .",
    "use the labels on the isi to separate the obtained train into two bootstrap trains .",
    "compute the ccsi for the bootstrap pair of spike trains .",
    "repeat steps 48 @xmath74 times to obtain @xmath74 bootstrap replicates of the ccsi .",
    "this algorithm simulates the joint distribution of the bivariate counting process under the null hypothesis and therefore reproduces the distribution of @xmath67 under the null . to facilitate the reading we delay a more technical description of the algorithm to appendix b. + we seek for significant reductions in synchronization during the awake - like period with respect to the sleep - like period ,",
    "so we computed a significance threshold as follows . for each @xmath75 and each time @xmath1 , @xmath76 is a bootstrap analogue of @xmath67 under @xmath59 .",
    "we assume constant synchrony in the period preceding the stimulus onset .",
    "therefore , the @xmath77-quantile of the set of all values of the bootstrap curves is a plausible choice for a critical value .",
    "we denote this value by @xmath78 .",
    "the null hypothesis is rejected at each time point @xmath61 $ ] if @xmath79 .",
    "observe that these choice of the critical value takes into account multiple testing .",
    "apart from differences in synchrony profiles before ( sleep - like ) and after ( awake - like ) the stimulus onset , we aim to develop a method to study differences in synchronization dynamics during the awake - like period induced by the activation of the two different pathways . in this context",
    "the relevant hypotheses are :    * @xmath80 for all @xmath81 $ ] * @xmath82 for some @xmath81 $ ] .    where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are @xmath12 under _ bs _ or _ bf _ stimulation respectively .",
    "we develop a test that enables to detect in which time periods there are differences , if any , between the awake - like activity induced by each pathway .",
    "the test statistic we use is @xmath85 in this case , due to the expected lack of stationarity induced by the stimulation , the bootstrap setup used in the previous section is not valid . as the test is to be applied in the time interval after stimulation ,",
    "we make use of the different trials for resampling . roughly speaking ,",
    "the method consists in shuffling the trials but taking into account the temporal dependence .",
    "this is , blocks of random lengths are chosen from randomly chosen trials but the order ( in time ) of the blocks is respected :    1 .   merge each trial of the pair of neurons into one train .",
    "this is , obtain one merged train for each recorded trial and keep the information of what original train each spike corresponds to . 2 .",
    "choose one trial at random and choose the first spike of that merged trial .",
    "3 .   given an already chosen spike time , @xmath86 , choose the next spike as @xmath87 from the same trial with probability @xmath71 .",
    "with probability @xmath72 , choose another trial , say @xmath88 , and define @xmath89 ( the next spike time for the bootstrap merged train ) as the next spike time in trial @xmath88 .",
    "4 .   repeat this procedure to obtain as many resampled trials as in the real data scenario .",
    "5 .   separate the resampled trials into the corresponding bootstrap trains .",

    "we used three simultaneously recorded neurons : a , b and c grouped in two pairs : a - b and a - c .",
