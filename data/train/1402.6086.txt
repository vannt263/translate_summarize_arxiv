    "the problem of persistent currents in a toroidal / annular potential of bose - einstein condensed atoms ( of a single species ) has attracted a lot of attention in recent years .",
    "the experiments of refs.@xcite have managed to create persistent currents in such trapping geometries and thus realize probably the most simple superfluid system that has been realized in the laboratory .",
    "these experiments are thus ideal for studying the fascinating effect of frictionless flow , which is one of the many problems associated with the more general effect of  superfluidity \" .",
    "a non - trivial extension of the problem of the stability of persistent currents is the one of mixtures of two distinguishable species . remarkably , this problem has been realized and examined in the recent experiment of ref.@xcite , which makes its theoretical study even more interesting . in ref.@xcite it was shown that the stability of persistent currents is strongly affected by the addition of a second component .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the labels of the two species and @xmath2 is the angular momentum per particle , with @xmath3 being the total angular momentum and @xmath4 being the total population of the two species , it was shown that in the range @xmath5 stability of persistent currents is possible for @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . in",
    "what follows below we assume that @xmath8 .    according to ref.@xcite ,",
    "the energy spectrum consists of a periodic part , plus an envelope parabolic function of @xmath9 , in analogy with the problem of a single component , as shown by felix bloch @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to examine the stability of persistent currents at the corresponding values of @xmath9 which are higher than unity , i.e. , at @xmath10 , with @xmath11 it turns out that for these values of @xmath9 the persistent currents are very fragile , even for very small concentrations of the minority component @xcite .",
    "motivated by ref.@xcite , two recent papers by anoshkin , wu , and zaremba @xcite and by wu and zaremba @xcite examined the same problem theoretically .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was shown that while for @xmath10 , with @xmath11 persistent currents are absent , indeed , still they are possible for @xmath12 . in the language of the present study they investigated the stability of persistent currents around the combination @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the azimuthal angle and @xmath16 to do this , the authors of ref.@xcite found solutions of the coupled nonlinear equations satisfied by the two order parameters and evaluated their energy .",
    "interestingly , the problem considered here may also be viewed from the point of view of solitary - wave solutions , where bound states of  gray \" and  bright \" solitary waves in the two components propagate together along the torus / annulus @xcite .    in the theoretical analysis of refs.@xcite and",
    "@xcite the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 which characterize the coupling between the species @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 respectively , were assumed to be equal to each other . here",
    "@xmath23 , where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the scattering length for elastic atom - atom collisions ( assumed to be positive ) , @xmath26 is the cross section of the toroidal / annular potential , which is approximated as a zero - width , ring potential of radius @xmath27 . in our analysis which follows below",
    "we assume equal values for the couplings @xmath28 and equal masses , @xmath29 . under these assumptions",
    "the condition for phase coexistence ( which is crucial in our analysis ) is satisfied @xcite .",
    "we stress that the problem of persistent currents in the case of unequal couplings and/or unequal masses has a very different behavior , as we will show in a future publication .    in this study",
    "we examine the problem of stability of persistent currents , starting with the states @xmath30 . clearly",
    "this pair of states has an angular momentum @xmath31 .",
    "the benefit from the present study is that it provides an alternative solution of the one given in ref.@xcite , as it avoids solving the two coupled nonlinear differential equations satisfied by @xmath32 and @xmath33 . as a result",
    ", this procedure is also physically transparent . as we explain in more detail below",
    ", the combination @xmath30 is not necessarily the lowest - energy ( yrast ) state for the specific value of @xmath31 , and thus one has to investigate this problem , too .    in what follows",
    "we first investigate in sec.ii the question of persistent currents for @xmath34 , assuming that the pair of states @xmath35 constitute the yrast state for the specific value of @xmath9 .",
    "it turns out that only the case @xmath36 may give stability of the currents @xcite .",
    "then , in sec.iii we investigate the conditions which make the pair @xmath37 the actual yrast state .",
    "we thus derive two phase boundaries in the plane diagram which involves the variables @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in sec.iv",
    "we present our numerical results . in sec.v",
    "we examine the lowest - energy state of the system in the limit of large values of the coupling , showing that the total density is homogeneous for all values of the angular momentum .",
    "finally , in sec.vi we give a summary and a discussion of our results .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system that we consider is @xmath40 here @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) , are the matrix elements for zero - energy elastic atom - atom collisions .    to determine the yrast state around the value of the angular momentum @xmath43 , we first assume that @xmath30 , @xmath44 , is the yrast state for @xmath45 ; the validity of this assumption is actually investigated in sec.iii . for values of @xmath46 , the order parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 will have admixtures of additional states , however while the amplitudes of @xmath47",
    ", @xmath48 will be of order unity , the amplitudes of these other states will be small , much smaller than unity .",
    "furthermore , since we are looking for the yrast state , the combination of the ( additional ) states which will enter @xmath32 will be of the form @xmath49 and correspondingly for @xmath33 , with @xmath50 the reason for this `` symmetric '' choice is that there is a process where two atoms with angular momentum @xmath51 scatter to two other states with angular momentum @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( angular momentum is conserved in the collisions ) .",
    "the corresponding term in the interaction energy will be proportional to @xmath54 , which may become negative , and thus lower the energy .",
    "finally , @xmath55 is equal to unity , since the states @xmath56 and @xmath57 have the lowest kinetic energy , while the matrix element of the interaction that is associated with the above scattering process is independent of the angular momentum .",
    "therefore , we consider the order parameters @xcite @xmath58 where the six coefficients satisfy the obvious conditions of particle normalization and of fixed angular momentum @xmath9 . as",
    "stated also above , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are assumed to be small , and thus linearisation is possible .",
    "we thus evaluate the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the states @xmath32 and @xmath33 and then perform this linearisation to find a quadratic expression for the energy per particle , which is @xmath61   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "however , not all three roots are acceptable . in order for the angular momentum @xmath9 to be smaller than @xmath83",
    "[ since we are interested in the case @xmath84 , only the two larger roots are acceptable .",

    "furthermore , the slope of the energy per particle ( or the  dispersion relation \" ) as function of @xmath9 is equal to @xmath88 .",
    "this may be seen from the fact that we have extremized @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 ) with respect to @xmath9 , which implies that @xmath91 , or @xmath92 /\\partial \\ell = -\\lambda$ ] . as a result , the root that gives the stability is the smaller of the two , since we have to choose the one that has the lowest possible energy",
    "actually , this the one close to the asymptote [ see the bullet in fig.1(a ) ] , as it was found initially in ref.@xcite .",
    "this root tends to @xmath93 for sufficiently large @xmath39 .",
    "the slope of the dispersion relation is thus @xmath94 and clearly only the case @xmath79 may give a local energy minimum @xcite .    turning to the case @xmath75 , there are two asymptotes and four roots [ as in figs.1(b ) and 1(c ) , where we have chosen @xmath95 and @xmath36 in the one case and @xmath96 and @xmath97 in the other , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 in both of them ] .",
    "the dashed horizontal line again corresponds to the value of @xmath82 .",
    "again , using the same procedure as above , it turns out that among the four possible roots only the higher two are acceptable in this case .",
    "again , the root that determines the stability is the one with the smaller value , and actually it is the larger of the two roots which result from the two asymptotes , indicated as bullets in the plots .",
    "for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , or in other words the slope is @xmath100 .",
    "obviously only the case @xmath79 may give a local energy minimum , again .    from fig.1",
    "it is seen clearly that the root which determines the slope in all three cases is positive for sufficiently large values of the coupling @xcite ( and thus the slope is negative ) only in the top and in the middle , but _ not _ in the bottom one .",
    "this observation is consistent with the fact that only in the case @xmath36 does one get stability of the currents .    , for ( a ) @xmath101 , ( b ) @xmath102 , and ( c ) @xmath103 .",

    "in the previous section we assumed implicitly that the pair of states @xmath111 gives the yrast state for the specific value of the angular momentum @xmath110 ( @xmath112 is set equal to zero from now on , since this is the only possible value that may give stability of the currents ) . for @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , where @xmath16 , the yrast state consists of the pairs @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , respectively , for any value of @xmath39 .",
    "for any other value of the angular momentum the yrast state may consist of a combination of more than one modes for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "for example , for weak interatomic interactions and @xmath119 , the whole yrast state consists only of the two lowest - energy modes , i.e. , @xmath120 on the other hand , for sufficiently strong values of @xmath39 , states of a homogeneous density distribution are candidates for being the yrast states , since they minimize the interaction energy .",
    "the combination @xmath13 has a homogeneous density distribution ( in each component separately ) , and this pair of states is indeed the yrast state under the conditions examined below .    to attack this problem one may use the approach described in the previous section , however in the present case the lagrange multiplier is not set equal to zero , but rather in addition to eq.([crit ] ) ( with @xmath36 ) self - consistency of eqs.([fbf ] ) and the equation for the angular momentum introduces the additional condition @xmath121 ^ 2    \\lambda   = 0 , \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{add}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 . using eqs.([crit ] ) and ( [ add ] ) one may eliminate @xmath69 and thus get the critical value of @xmath39 , @xmath123 , as a function of @xmath38 ( or equivalently @xmath124 ) . while this has to be done numerically in general ,",
    "the limiting cases may be handled analytically . for @xmath108 , then @xmath125 , and thus @xmath126 in agreement with the result of wu and zaremba @xcite . comparing the above value of @xmath123 of eq.([addd ] ) with @xmath127 , given by eq.([crg111 ] ) , it turns out that @xmath128 .",
    "in addition , for large values of @xmath39 , then @xmath129 and thus there is one asymptote for the following value of @xmath38 @xmath130 where the solution with the negative sign is not acceptable .",
    "again , the above expression agrees with the one given by ref.@xcite . comparing this value of @xmath131 from eq.([asympto ] ) with @xmath132 given by eq.([asymp ] ) we see that @xmath133 .",
    "in addition to the above analytical results , we investigated numerically ( variationally ) the phase boundary for the combination @xmath13 to become the yrast state ( i.e. , the question investigated in sec.iii ) .",
    "we have thus kept the two neighbouring states around @xmath47 and @xmath134 , namely @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the result of this calculation is shown as the dashed curve in fig.2 for @xmath137 .",
    "this curve terminates due to numerical reasons .",
    "our results , however , are consistent with the divergence of @xmath123 for @xmath138 , according to eq.([asympto ] ) . also , for @xmath108 , @xmath139 , in agreement with eq.([addd ] ) .    more generally , the whole phase boundary that defines the pair @xmath13 to be the actual yrast state coincides with the one that results from the analysis presented in sec.iii , i.e. , from the solution of eqs.([crit ] ) and ( [ add ] ) . in the same figure we have also included the phase boundary for the stability of persistent currents for @xmath140 , eq.([me ] ) , [ again for @xmath137 ] , where @xmath142 .",
    "thus , the results of this section confirm the general picture which implies that the phase for stability of the currents is always included within the phase for the pair @xmath143 to be the yrast state , and thus the results of sec.ii  which rely on this crucial assumption  are always valid .",
    "( dashed curve ) and @xmath127 ( solid curve ) versus @xmath38 , for @xmath102.,width=302,height=207 ]",
    "one remarkable result of the analysis presented in sec.ii is that the slope of the solution that determines the stability of the currents saturates , as it has an upper bound , even for large values of @xmath39 .",
    "this is easily seen , since the solution that determines the stability comes from either the only asymptote in the case @xmath144 , or one of the two asymptotes for ( @xmath145 ) of @xmath77 .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath98 , the slope of the dispersion relation for large values of @xmath39 tends to @xmath146 when @xmath147 , and it tends to @xmath148 when @xmath149 .",
    "to get some insight into this result , let us examine the density , which is given by ( since @xmath150 and @xmath151 ) , @xmath152 ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "n_b(\\theta ) & = & \\frac { x_b } { 2 \\pi r } [ 1 + 2(d_{-1}+d_{1 } ) \\cos \\theta].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] examining the term @xmath153 that appears in the total density @xmath154 , it turns out that this is proportional to @xmath155 as eq.([crit ] ) implies . in other words , the density variation of @xmath154 is constant ( to order @xmath156 ) , which is the reason for the saturation of the slope : the system manages to maintain its density homogeneous ( thus gaining potential energy ) at the expense of kinetic energy ( due to the extra components @xmath135 and @xmath136 in the order parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively ) . for example , for @xmath147 it may be seen after some algebra that for @xmath157 @xmath158 from this formula it follows that the difference @xmath159 is indeed due to the kinetic energy .",
    "the same equation also implies that the slope is @xmath146 , as we argued also above .    actually , the homogeneity of the total density is a more general result , which characterizes the yrast state for all values of the angular momentum when the coupling is sufficiently large . as shown in ref.@xcite , for @xmath160 and @xmath161 , the total density is homogeneous exactly for any value of @xmath39 .",
    "the same result holds for large values of @xmath39 , also for @xmath162 , and thus for _ all _ values of @xmath9 .    to demonstrate this",
    ", we performed a constrained minimization of the energy of the system considering the trial order parameters @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "the imposed constraints were that of particle normalization , of a fixed angular momentum , and finally a constant total density distribution .",
    "figure 3 shows the result of this calculation . in this calculation",
    "the coupling drops out completely from the energy , apart from the  background \" energy of the homogeneous density distribution [ which has an energy @xmath165 .",
    "this calculation thus demonstrates the saturation that we described earlier .",
    "the homogeneity of the total density distribution is expected to become asymptotically exact for large values of @xmath39 . in a sense , this effect is analogous to the fermionization of hard - core bosons in one dimension , where the system pays kinetic energy via the fermionization of the bosons , however it gains ( more ) energy because of the assumed large value of the coupling between the particles .    in the same figure",
    "we also show the result of the minimization of the energy via the method of imaginary - time propagation , for some fixed and relatively large value of the coupling @xmath166 . in this calculation , in order to fix the expectation value of the angular momentum , we have used a lyapunov functional @xcite . while close to each other , the two curves do not coincide , for three reasons .",
    "the first one is that they do not correspond to the same value of @xmath39 .",
    "the second reason is that the one for finite @xmath39 is exact up to numerical error .",
    "the third reason is that the one for finite @xmath39 does not have the constraint of an exactly homogeneous density distribution .",
    "as we saw earlier , variations in the total density of order @xmath156 are expected to be present , as we have also confirmed in the numerical solution we have found with the method of the imaginary - time propagation .    further evidence for the homogeneity of the total density distribution is also shown in fig.4 , where we plot the density of the two species @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and also the total density distribution @xmath154 , for the values used in fig.3 ( @xmath169 , @xmath170 , and @xmath166 ) and also choosing @xmath9 to be 0.3 .",
    "while the density of the two components shows a substantial variation over the ring , the total density is very close to homogeneous , with fluctuations which are of order @xmath156 , as we have checked from our data .     and",
    "@xmath170 , with @xmath171 in the lower curve and  large \" @xmath39 in the higher , evaluated through the two methods described in sec.v.,width=302,height=226 ]     ( dotted curve ) , @xmath168 ( dashed dotted curve ) , and the total density @xmath172 ( solid curve ) , for @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath170 , and @xmath166 that results from the method of imaginary time propagation described in sec.v.,width=302,height=226 ]",
    "in the present study we have examined the problem of stability of persistent currents of a mixture of two bose - einstein condensates which are confined in a ring potential considering the combination @xmath30 .",
    "we have thus found that only the case @xmath13 may give rise to stability of the currents , in agreement with the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "the ( essentially variational ) method that we have used gives insight into this problem , since it avoids solving the two coupled nonlinear differential equations . on the other hand",
    ", there is an additional complication , which has to do with the states @xmath111 being the actual yrast states .",
    "as we have seen , for sufficiently strong interactions and a large population imbalance this combination becomes the yrast state , as seen in the lower curve of fig.2 , for @xmath95 .",
    "for even larger values of the coupling the combination @xmath143 becomes a local minimum of the dispersion relation , provided that the above solution does not belong to the linear part of the dispersion @xcite .    in order for our analysis of the stability of the persistent currents to be valid  which investigates",
    "the behavior of the system at @xmath175  requires that the combination @xmath13 is the yrast state for @xmath110 . in the ( @xmath38 ",
    "@xmath39 ) phase diagram , there are thus two phase boundaries which need to be derived .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath79 the condition for stability of the currents guarantees that the pair @xmath13 is the yrast state [ for @xmath110 and @xmath176 .",
    "as seen from fig.2 , for some fixed population imbalance and some fixed angular momentum @xmath110 , as the coupling increases , first the combination @xmath143 becomes the yrast state and then it provides a local minimum in the dispersion relation .",
    "another remarkable and general result of our study is the homogeneity of the total density distribution ( see fig.4 ) , which characterizes the _ whole _ yrast spectrum for large values of the coupling constant . in this limit",
    "the yrast state has this surprisingly simple feature , in a sense resembling the tonks - girardeau limit of fermionized bosons .",
    "last but not least , it is worth comparing the above results ( which assume that @xmath177 ) with the case where these are unequal , which will be examined in a future publication . the main difference ( in terms of the applicability ) of the main result of this study , i.e. , eq.([me ] ) , is when @xmath124 is not sufficiently small . for equal values of the @xmath28 considered here ,",
    "stability of persistent currents is not possible . on the other hand , for",
    "unequal values of the @xmath28 metastability may be possible for sufficiently strong interatomic interactions .",
    "in addition , the case @xmath178 may also give rise to persistent currents , as opposed to the present problem .",
    "finally , more local minima may appear in the dispersion relation .",
    "given that an experiment on this problem has already been performed @xcite , it would be interesting to investigate whether the interesting structure revealed in the theoretical studies of this problem is indeed observable .",
    "we thank zhigang wu and eugene zaremba for pointing out that the case @xmath178 requires special care .",
    "this project is implemented through the operational program `` education and lifelong learning '' , action archimedes iii and is co - financed by the european union ( european social fund ) and greek national funds ( national strategic reference framework 2007 - 2013 ) .",
    "we stress here that when we refer to  large \" values of the coupling we restrict ourselves to the case where , although @xmath39 is large , still @xmath179 , so that the gas is still in the mean - field limit , away from the tonks - girardeau regime ."
