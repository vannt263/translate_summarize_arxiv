    "single layer of iron selenide ( @xmath1 ) grown on a strong polar insulator @xmath13 ( sto ) exhibits superconductivitywang12,jia15,ultrafast16,wang14,lee14,swave at surprisingly high temperature @xmath14 .",
    "this is an order of magnitude larger than the parent bulk material with the superconducting transition temperature@xcite @xmath15 of @xmath16 .",
    "this suggests that the dominant mechanism of creation of the superconductivity in the @xmath1 layer might be different from that of the bulk @xmath1 and is caused by influence of the sto substrate . to strengthen this point of view the high - resolution angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments@xcite and the ultrafast dynamicsultrafast16 demonstrated the presence of high - energy phonons in sto .",
    "the frequency of the oxygen longitudinal optical ( lo ) mode reaches @xmath17 .",
    "in addition it turns out that the phonons couple strongly to the electrons in the @xmath1 layer ( the coupling constant was estimated to be@xcite @xmath11 , much larger than in the parent material , @xmath18 ) .",
    "the band is flat with only a small momentum transfer to electrons .",
    "this identification is supported by the earlier arpes on sto surface states , which shows a phonon - induced hump at approximately @xmath19 away from the main band and through inelastic neutron scatteringphononsto .",
    "the role of substrate in assisting superconductivity is not limited to generation of phonons .",
    "the polar sto has a huge dielectric constant ( estimated to be above @xmath20 on the surface ) and hence suppresses coulomb repulsion inside the @xmath1 layer .",
    "the nature of electronic states within the @xmath1 layer is by now quite settled experimentally .",
    "the fermi surface of the single unit cell ( 1uc ) consists of two electron - like pockets centred around the crystallographic m - point ( brillouin zone corners ) with a band bottom below the fermi level@xcite @xmath21 .",
    "this means that electrons form a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with small chemical potential .",
    "the novelty of the superconducting system is that the occupied states are close to the band edge , very far from the classic case . in both conventional ( bcs ) and unconventional superconductors",
    "the chemical potential is the largest energy scale in the problem ( even in quasi 2d high @xmath4 cuprates the chemical potential is order of magnitude higher ) .",
    "stm measurements in the superconducting state demonstrates that there are no nodes@xcite ( no sign change of the order parameter ) .",
    "it shows at @xmath22 a fully peaked gap ( with double peaks at @xmath23 with minimum at @xmath24 ) which is suppressed only by magnetic impurities , similar to a conventional 2d s - wave superconductor .",
    "absence of nesting indicates that there are no effects like charge density waves .",
    "an early theory@xcite focused on the screening due to the sto ferroelectric phonons on antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations mediated cooper pairing in parent material @xmath1 .",
    "it suggested that the phonons significantly enhance the cooper pairing and even change the pairing symmetry .",
    "naively the spin fluctuation interaction by itself should lead to nodeless d - wave pairing . for the electron - phonon coupling @xmath25 the enhancement was large , although perhaps not enough to explain the experiment .",
    "when the inter - pocket electron - phonon scattering is also strong , opposite - sign pairing will give way to equal - sign pairing .",
    "later @xcite it was suggested that the interfacial nature of the coupling assists superconductivity in most channels , including those mediated by spin fluctuations .",
    "another idea @xcite is to use both the electron pockets at the fermi surface band and the `` incipient '' hole band below it also found in arpes , namely generalizing to the multiband model .",
    "the conclusion was that `` a weak bare phonon interaction can be used to create a large @xmath4 , even with a spin fluctuation interaction which may be weakened by the incipient band . '' the difficulty is that the forward scattering nature of the essential phonon processes then means that lo phonons can not contribute to the inter - band interaction .",
    "gorkov considered@xcite polarization on the surface , screening and the sto surface lo phonon pairing .",
    "his conclusion is that the lo phonon mediated pairing alone can not account for superconductivity at such high @xmath4 .",
    "the small chemical potential is typical for the sto systems .",
    "another related superconducting ( with much lower @xmath4 ) 2deg system with even much smaller chemical potential is the @xmath3(lao)-sto interface observed earlier@xcite .",
    "the microscopic origin of the superconductivity in the lao / sto system is already quite clear@xcite .",
    "it is the bcs - like s - wave pairing attributed to the same lo phonon modes discussed above in context of the 1uc@xmath26sto system .",
    "spin fluctuations seem not to play any role in the pairing leading to superconductivity .",
    "the phase diagram of lao / sto is qualitatively similar to the dome - shaped phase diagram of the cuprate superconductors : in the underdoped region the critical temperature increases with charge carrier depletion .",
    "the theoretical effort to understand the lao / sto system@xcite resulted in realization that the migdal - eliashberg theory of superconductivity , valid when the phonon frequencies are much smaller than the electron fermi energy , should be generalized .",
    "this is not the case for polar crystals like sto with sufficiently high optical - phonon frequencies , and consequently the dielectric function approach proposed long ago by kirzhnits@xcite and developed in ref@xcite proved to be useful .",
    "it was shown that the plasma excitations are important at larger @xmath27 ( reduce the electron - phonon coupling ) and enable to explain the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath4 as function of bias that changes chemical potential .    in this paper",
    "we further develop a theory of superconductivity in 1uc@xmath1/sto and lao / sto based on phononic mechanism including effects of the screened coulomb repulsion .",
    "in the _ first stage _ a simple model of 2deg with pairing mediated by a dispersionless lo phonons is proposed with coulomb repulsion assumed to be completely screened by huge polarization of sto ( @xmath28 in 1uc@xmath1/sto ) . in this case",
    "the gap equations of the frohlich model can be reduced ( without approximations ) to an integral equation with one variable only and are solved numerically for arbitrary fermi energy @xmath29 , phonon frequency @xmath7 and electron - phonon coupling @xmath30 .",
    "an expression for the adiabatic and nonadiabatic limits are derived and results for @xmath4 compare well with experiments on 1uc@xmath1/sto .",
    "then , in the _ second stage _",
    "we include the rpa screened coulomb repulsion ( for somewhat smaller values of dielectric constants are estimated@xcite to be @xmath31 on the sto side and @xmath32 on the lao side ) and solve a more complicated gap equations numerically ( without making use of the kirzhnits ansatz ) for various @xmath29 and coulomb coupling constant .",
    "both the adiabatic , @xmath33 , ( conventional bcs ) and the nonadiabatic , @xmath34 , cases are considered and compared with the local model studied earlier in the context of bec physicsbec2drev , melik , randeria2d , chubukov . the coulomb repulsion results in significant reduction or even suppression of superconductivity . a phenomenological model for dependence of @xmath29 and @xmath6 on electric field for the lao / sto is proposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic 2deg phonon superconductivity model is introduced in section ii .",
    "the general gaussian approximation for weak electron - phonon interactions and rpa screening is described in section iii . the superstrong screening case ( neglecting coulomb repulsion altogether ) case is solved section iv .",
    "the same calculation is performed using the kirzhnits approach in section v. the general case including the rpa screened coulomb repulsion is investigated numerically in section vi .",
    "the phenomenology of 1uc@xmath1/sto and lao / sto and comparison with experiments are discussed in section vii followed by discussion and summary .",
    "appendices a and b contain the derivation of gorkov equations and the 2d rpa neutralizing background contribution respectively .",
    "as mentioned above various sto systems including 1uc@xmath1/sto ( medium to low density ) and interface lao / sto the ( very low density ) electron gas appears localized in a plane of width of one unit cell ( in fese layer or on the sto side respectively ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system contains three parts@xmath35      we use a continuum parabolic 2deg model one `` flavours '' ( up and down spin projections and two valleys in 1uc@xmath36 ) with effective mass close to mass of electron@xcite ) .",

    "the electrostatics on the surface / interface is quite intricate@xcite , and we approximate it by the coulomb repulsion : @xmath43where @xmath44 is and effective 2d dielectric constant of the system . as mentioned in introduction the effective dielectric constant is huge in sto at low temperatures due to the ionic movements .",
    "crystal vibrations in sto are highly energetic .",

    "the 2uc fese / sto already has three pockets and resembles the parent material more than 1uc@xmath1/sto .      in this case",
    "the dielectric constant is one order of magnitude smaller ( @xmath232 on the sto side and @xmath233 on the lao side , see ref.@xcite where accurate electrostatics was considered ) than in 1uc@xmath1/sto . consequently the coulomb repulsion can not be neglected , especially in view of very low @xmath234 .",
    "therefore we have to use the full model of section iv . in this case one",
    "takes @xmath109 and effective mass @xmath235 ( where @xmath236 is the electron mass in vacuum ) .",
    "recently@xcite the electron - phonon coupling and chemical potential were measured by tunneling from the underdoped to the overdoped region . generally in the underdoped region",
    "the chemical potential rises linearly with the gate voltage @xmath237 , @xmath238 with the slope @xmath239 and is saturated in the overdoped region at value @xmath240 .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling apparently decreases very slowly , @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the undoped value , and @xmath243 is the slope .",
    "our approximate formula eq.([fit_alfa ] ) in this case gives the dependence @xmath244 \\text{. } \\label{voltage}\\ ] ]    taking a measured value for the lo4 mode @xmath245 , lets us estimate the coulomb repulsion constant as@xmath246for @xmath247 .",
    "substituting these values one obtains the fit to experimental values of ref.@xcite , see fig.7 .",
    ".,width=453 ]    qualitatively there are two conflicting tendencies at play .",
    "the reduction of the electron - phonon coupling with @xmath237 reduces @xmath4 , while the increase of @xmath29 ( the charging appears according to experiment only in the underdoped region ) increases @xmath4 .",
    "the overall effect is that in the underdoped case the second tendency prevails , while in the overdoped only the first exists .",
    "this explains the``dome '' shape .",
    "pairing in one atomic layer thick two dimensional electron gas on a strongly dielectric substrate by a single band of high energy longitudinal optical phonons is considered in detail .",
    "the phonon band is assumed to be nearly dispersionless with frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the polar dielectric @xmath0 exhibits such an energetic phonon mode and the 2deg is created both when one unit cell @xmath1 layer is grown on its @xmath2 surface and on the interface with another dielectric like @xmath3 . both the adiabatic , @xmath33 , and the nonadiabatic , @xmath10 , cases are considered and compare well with conventional weak coupling bcs and with the local instantaneous interaction model ( describing the nonadiabatic regime close to the bec crossoverbec2drev , melik , randeria2d , chubukov still assuming that @xmath248 , where @xmath115 is the binding energy , so that the pairing is the bcs type rather than bec ) respectively .",
    "the focus was however on the intermediate region .",
    "the reason is that in several novel materials this is precisely the case . in particular in high @xmath4 one unit cell @xmath1 on @xmath249",
    "the fermi energy is a bit smaller than the phonon frequency @xmath250 . in interface superconductors like @xmath251 interfaces",
    "the ration is smaller @xmath252 still well above the nonadiabatic limit .",
    "it turns out that in the crossover region the critical temperature decreases very slowly as function of @xmath29 , up to @xmath253 , see figs 2 and 3 , and only then drops fast to zero .",
    "the critical temperature was calculated within the weak coupling model of superconductivity .",
    "the theory was applied to two different realizations of such a system : 1uc@xmath1/sto and @xmath251 interfaces .",
    "the numerical solution of the gap equation at @xmath254 was compared with an often utilized kirzhnits dielectric approach for arbitrary ratio @xmath255 this comparison demonstrated excellent agreement between two theories in non - adiabatic range while in adiabatic region the kirzhnits theory gives lower @xmath4 than the numerical solution of the gap equation .",
    "we conclude that , despite small electron concentration , very high critical temperatures observed recently are consistent with the mostly phononic mechanism already due to combination of two peculiar properties of the system .",
    "first , since the optical phonon frequencies @xmath7 are very large and electrons reside in small pockets , @xmath7 is larger than @xmath5 .",
    "second , due to the huge dielectric constant of sto the coulomb repulsion is strongly suppressed inside the layer leading to small @xmath8 .",
    "the required value of the electron - phonon coupling in the superconducting layer is @xmath11 in 1uc@xmath1/sto and @xmath256 in lao / sto . in low @xmath4 lao",
    "/ sto the less suppressed coulomb repulsion results in significant reduction or even suppression of superconductivity . a phenomenological model for dependence of @xmath29 and @xmath6 on electric field for the lao / sto is proposed .",
    "the main insight from this work therefore is that small value of @xmath5 is not an obstacle to achieve @xmath4 of order @xmath257 @xmath7 as long as @xmath6 is sufficiently large and the coulomb repulsion is effectively suppressed by polarization of the 3d substrate .    _",
