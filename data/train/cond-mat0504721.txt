    "the dynamics and roughening of moving interfaces in a disordered medium is a subject of intense interest in non - equilibrium statistical physics @xcite .",
    "examples where such processes are relevant include thin film deposition @xcite , slow combustion fronts in paper @xcite , fluid invasion in fractals @xcite and porous media @xcite , and wetting and propagation of contact lines @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the underlying physics involved in interface roughening is crucial to the control and optimization of these processes , with immediately apparent technological importance .",
    "progress in the theoretical study of interface dynamics has been made over the last two decades and a number of theories have been developed @xcite which agree with the experimental findings in some cases .",
    "much of the theoretical work has been based on analyzing ( spatially ) local interface equations , such as the celebrated kardar - paris - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite , where the physics is governed by a ( nonlinear ) partial differential equation which couples the interface _ locally _ with itself and the quenched randomness .",
    "however , in many cases such a description is not possible @xcite .",
    "a particularly important class of problems in the field of kinetic roughening where local theories can not provide a complete description are those involving fluid invasion in porous media , which are often experimentally studied using hele - shaw cells @xcite or even paper as the wetting medium @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that if the transport of liquid to the advancing wetting front from the reservoir is neglected as in local theories , slowing down of the front in spontaneous imbibition of water in paper can not be explained by local theories unless the liquid conservation law is included in some artificial way . to properly describe the dynamics of wetting fronts in random medium",
    "is a challenging task , and there are several recent theoretical attempts to this end @xcite . in particular , in refs .",
    "@xcite dube _ et al .",
    "_ developed a phase - field model explicitly addressing the issue of liquid conservation in the wetting of a random medium .",
    "this is achieved by a generalized cahn - hilliard equation with suitable boundary condition which couples the system to the reservoir .",
    "a variant of the sharp interface projection method @xcite was used to analytically obtain a non - local interface equation for the case of spontaneous imbibition , and from it a new time dependent length scale governing the kinetic roughening @xmath4 , was extracted . in refs .",
    "@xcite the kinetic roughening of 2d wetting fronts was also analyzed , and estimates for the corresponding scaling exponents were obtained . furthermore , in a recent comprehensive review paper @xcite the case of forced wetting in 2d was briefly discussed , and in ref .",
    "@xcite forced wetting in a 3d model of paper was also considered .    in the present work",
    "our aim is to carry out a comprehensive analysis of wetting fronts in 2d in the case of forced wetting . to this end",
    ", we use the phase - field model of ref .",
    "@xcite with boundary conditions corresponding to a constant mass flux at the reservoir boundary .",
    "this makes the wetting fronts move at a constant average velocity , in contrast to the washburn law for spontaneous wetting .",
    "we first expand on the standard projection method to make it usable under constant flow boundary conditions , and derive the linearized interface equations corresponding to the forced case .",
    "analysis of these equations reveals a crossover length scale @xmath0 , which is time - independent in contrast to the spontaneous wetting case @xcite , and depends on the interface velocity as @xmath5 .",
    "it separates two regimes of dissipative behavior and governs the kinetic roughening of the interfaces by giving an upper cutoff for the correlation length of the interface fluctuations . by numerically integrating the phase field model",
    ", we find that the interfaces are superrough with a roughness exponent of @xmath1 , and a growth exponent of @xmath6 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with recent experiments on hele - shaw cells @xcite .",
    "we also make a direct numerical comparison between the solutions of the full phase field model and the corresponding linearized interface equation .",
    "good agreement is found in spatial correlations , while the temporal correlations in the two models are somewhat different .",
    "this paper proceeds as follows : in section [ model ] we define the phase field model , and present results from the projection and linearization procedure .",
    "we present the resulting interface equations , as well as discuss how the crossover length scale @xmath0 emerges . in section [ numerics ]",
    "we present our numerical results for the driven interfaces in disordered medium .",
    "we consider both spatial and temporal correlation functions , as well as compare the numerical results from the linearized interface equation to the phase field model .",
    "finally , we present our discussion and conclusions in section [ conclusions ] . the appendices",
    "a and b contain some technical details on the projection and linearization procedures leading to the interface equations .",
    "the model describes the dynamics of a liquid invading a disordered medium at a coarse - grained level .",
    "a phase field is used to describe the `` wet '' and `` dry '' phases , with a free energy functional such that the dimensionless phase field obtains the values @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the wet and dry phases , respectively .",
    "since the phase field is an effective density field it is locally conserved .",
    "energy cost for an interface is added by the standard coarse - grained gradient squared term .",
    "the interaction energy between the random medium and the invading liquid is represented by a quenched random field linearly coupled to the phase field .",
    "this leads to the free energy density @xcite @xmath9=\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi(\\mathbf{x , t}))^2+v(\\phi(\\mathbf{x , t } ) ) -\\alpha(\\mathbf{x})\\phi(\\mathbf{x},t),\\ ] ] where @xmath10 has two minima at @xmath8 and @xmath7 , and @xmath11 is the quenched random field .",

    "@xmath12 @xcite , and the quenched field obeys the relations @xmath13 the case of positive ( negative ) @xmath14 corresponds to the liquid spontaneously wetting ( dewetting ) the medium for the case of no external driving @xcite .",

    "the result is @xmath18,\\ ] ] which is essentially the cahn - hilliard equation @xcite .",
    "note that dimensionless units have been set such that the constant relating the phase field gradient to the free energy and the mobility in fick s law are both unity .",
    "this fixes the choice of units in eq . .    in refs",
    "@xcite the case of spontanous , capillary driven wetting was modeled with eq . using boundary conditions where the chemical potential was set to a constant at the liquid reservoir @xmath19 . in order to model the experimental setup of driving the liquid from the reservoir ,",
    "we define our phase - field in the half - plane @xmath20 , and at the line @xmath19 impose the boundary condition @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the unit vector , and @xmath23 is a constant ( flux ) parameter ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . on the top end of the system we set @xmath24 , and use periodic boundaries in the @xmath25 direction .",
    "physically this corresponds to driving the liquid via a constant mass flow , leading to an interface propagating at a constant average velocity @xcite .",
    "the initial condition for the phase field is given by a step function at some height @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is also a parameter in our model , but with the gradient boundary condition here its value is irrelevant , in contrast to the case of spontaneous imbibition , where @xmath28 defines the initial average velocity of the interface @xcite .      the quenched disorder field @xmath29 will cause an initially flat interface to kinetically roughen when it propagates as the liquid invades the medium .",
    "a key step in understanding the physics of this process is writing an equation of motion for the 1d single - valued height variable @xmath30 , defined conveniently by the condition @xmath31 as shown in fig .",
    "it is not obvious _ a priori _ that this can be done , since the problem is inherently non - local due to the conservation law @xcite , but it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that this can be done using methods discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in appendix",
    "[ a ] we will discuss some technical details of the derivation .",
    "the main idea is to use the relevant green s function of the problem defined by @xmath32 with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "this leads to the integro - differential equation of motion @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the interface curvature , and @xmath35 is the boundary term , which is non - vanishing for inhomogenous boundary conditions .",
    "note that eq",
    ".   holds for any geometry given the appropriate green s function . for the half plane with von neumann boundary condition at @xmath19 , the 2d green s function",
    "is obtained by image charge method as @xmath36.\\ ] ] the next step towards an explicit interface equation is to linearize in fluctuations around the disorder - free system solution , @xmath37 , and transform to fourier space , where the equations of different modes of fluctuation are decoupled . the half plane green s function defined in eq .",
    "( [ half - plane green ] ) is not square integratable , however , and thus it does not have a fourier representation .",
    "however , we have found that we can avoid this problem by considering a finite strip of width @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and derive a linearized equation of motion for the _ discrete _ fourier modes of the fluctuations .",
    "then we can take the limit @xmath40 to obtain the equation of motion in fourier space for an interface in half - plane geometry , and the end result is well - defined .",
    "this procedure is exposed in some detail in appendix [ b ] .",
    "the linearization procedure , by construction , gives a separate equation of motion for the mean interface position @xmath41 , which turns out to be coupled to all the fluctuation fourier modes @xmath42 , while the evolutions of the fluctuation modes are independent of each other .",
    "the resulting equations are given by @xmath43 from which we immediately obtain the expected result that @xmath44 this should be contrasted with the washburn law @xmath45 in the case of spontaneous wetting @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the functional form of eq . for the fluctuations of",
    "the interface is similar to the case of spontaneous wetting in ref .",
    "@xcite , except for some sign changes in the terms .",
    "it can be shown that these changes are a direct consequence of the differences between the green s functions in the two cases , and they lead to significant differences in the behavior of the fluctuations as will be discussed below .",
    "the most immediate aspect of these equations is that the fluctuation equation is non - local in real space .",
    "this is to be expected due to the conservation law @xcite .",
    "the locality of the interface equation in fourier space owes to the fact that it has been linearized .",
    "the interface configuration couples to the disorder in a fundamentally non - linear manner , a fact that is somewhat obscured by the superficially simple form of the disorder term @xmath46 , which is defined as @xmath47 the moments of @xmath46 averaged over disorder realizations thus couple to the interface configuration realizations , which in turn are defined by the disorder .",
    "this makes the analysis of @xmath46 a formidable task that must be solved self - consistently involving the interface equation . in more explicit terms , in expressions such as @xmath48 , the angular brackets denote averages over different realizations of @xmath49 , and results can only be obtained numerically .    in eq .",
    "there are two terms that dissipate fluctuations corresponding to different physical effects : the surface tension term @xmath50 and the liquid transport ( conservation law ) @xmath51 .",
    "the surface tension dominates when @xmath52 , leading to a _ time independent _ crossover length scale between the two terms given by @xmath53 this is in striking contrast to the spontaneous case , where the corresponding crossover length is _ time dependent _ with @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the dispersion relation of the fluctuations there is an additional crossover in the transport term obtained by comparing the length scales @xmath41 and @xmath55 .",
    "namely , for @xmath56 the transport term is @xmath57 , while for @xmath58 it is @xmath59 , leading to a crossover between @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the dispersion relation of the interface fluctuations .",
    "regardless of the magnitude of @xmath62 , we will show through numerical studies that the crossover length scale @xmath0 controls the kinetic roughening of the interface in analogy to the spontaneous imbibition case , in that it defines an upper cut - off for fluctuations that are increasing in time and correlated by the surface tension .",
    "the interface fluctuations in the presence of quenched disorder were analyzed by numerical integrations of eq .",

    "the above equation is then solved with the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath67 .",
    "this is a numerical trick invoked to obtain a chemical potential profile consistent with the von neumann boundary condition in the domain from the reservoir at @xmath19 to the interface at @xmath68 .",

    "it is interesting to note from fig .",
    "[ configuration](c ) that behind the moving interface the density field has a finite slope , which remains constant in time .",
    "this is due to the underlying local conservation law for @xmath81 .",
    "we note that the slighly growing value of @xmath82 which is greater than @xmath83 is just a numerical artifact and can be removed by using a method of moving box to hold the interface at a constant height , _",
    "i.e. _ pulling down the disorder field at constant time intervals .      with @xmath84 , the driven wetting front",
