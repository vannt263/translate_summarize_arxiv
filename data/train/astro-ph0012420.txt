    "the idea of varying fundamental constants is not a new one : milne ( 1935 , 1937 ) and dirac ( 1937 ) independently suggested a varying newton gravitational constant .",
    "more modern theories , such as superstring theory , naturally predict variations in fundamental coupling constants ( e.g. forgcs & horvth 1979 ; marciano 1984 ; barrow 1987 ; li & gott 1998 ) , strongly motivating an experimental search .",
    "several authors have demonstrated the idea ( varshalovich & potekhin 1995 and references therein ) , first used by bahcall , sargent & schmidt ( 1967 ) , of using spectra of high redshift gas clouds seen in absorption against background quasars ( qsos ) to constrain possible variation of the fine structure constant , @xmath4 , over cosmological time - scales .",
    "this method is based on a comparison of the observed transition wavelengths of alkali doublets and recent applications of it have yielded constraints on @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the values of @xmath0 at the absorption cloud redshift @xmath8 and in the laboratory respectively ( e.g. cowie & songaila 1995 ; ivanchik , potekhin & varshalovich 1999 ; varshalovich , potekhin & ivanchik 2000 ) .",
    "recently , we have increased the level of precision obtained with the alkali doublet method to @xmath9 using higher quality data ( murphy et al .",
    "2000c ) .",
    "however , a new method offering an order of magnitude improvement in precision was suggested by dzuba , flambaum & webb ( 1999a , b ) and was demonstrated by webb et al .",
    "( 1999 , hereafter w99 ) .",
    "the increase in precision derives from the fact that the relativistic corrections to the energy levels of different ions vary from species to species by up to an order of magnitude . a comparison of the observed mgi , mgii and feii transition wavelengths in 30 absorption systems allowed w99 to tentatively suggest that the mean value of @xmath10 over the redshift range @xmath11 : the fine structure constant may have been smaller in the past .",
    "the present work is the companion paper of murphy et al .",
    "( 2001a , hereafter m01a ) in which we discuss our techniques in detail and present the results of recent work .",
    "we summarise the main points here .",
    "we obtained keck / hires spectra of 28 qsos and analysed 49 absorption systems lying along their lines of sight .",
    "these systems included those mgii / feii systems considered in w99 and also a higher redshift sample of damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) containing absorption lines of ions such as mgi , mgii , alii , aliii , siii , crii , feii , niii and znii , so that our redshift range now covers @xmath12 , corresponding to look - back times from 5 to 12 billion years ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "our absorption systems fell conveniently into two sub - samples : the mgii / feii systems comprised the low redshift sample ( @xmath16 ) and the dlas comprised the high redshift sample ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "there were , however , 2 mgii / feii absorbers within the  sample that lay at low redshift but we have included them in the  sample since the observations and data reduction for the two sub - samples were carried out independently by two different groups .",
    "the analysis is based on the following equation for the wavenumber , @xmath18 , of a given transition at a redshift @xmath8 ; @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the laboratory rest wavenumber of the transition , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are relativistic coefficients , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that the second and third terms on the right hand side only contribute if @xmath25 .",
    "the values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been calculated using many - body techniques in dzuba et al .",
    "( 1999a , b , 2001 ) and we tabulate those values relevant to our analysis in table 1 of m01a .",
    "the values of @xmath20 must be known to a high precision in order to place stringent constraints on @xmath3 .",
    "a precision of @xmath26 corresponds to an uncertainty on @xmath20 @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) since these coefficients are typically an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath21 coefficients .",
    "consider two transitions , one with a low atomic mass , the other a high atomic mass .",
    "typically , the difference between the @xmath21 coefficients for a light species ( e.g. mgii ) and a heavy species ( e.g. feii ) is @xmath29 .",
    "equation [ eq : omega ] , applied to these two transitions , then shows that a precision of @xmath20 of @xmath27 is required in order to detect a variation of @xmath26 . ] .",
    "this corresponds fairly well to the data quality since we can centroid an absorption feature to approximately one tenth of the hires resolution , @xmath30 .",
    "such precision has not been previously achieved for most resonance transitions of ionized species and so measurements of @xmath20 for all relevant species were carried out by several groups ( nave et al .",
    "1991 ; pickering , thorne & webb 1998 ; pickering et al .",
    "2000 ; griesmann & kling 2000 ) using laboratory fourier transform spectrometers .",
    "we have summarised and tabulated these measurements in m01a .    knowing all values of @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ", we then deconvolve each absorption system into individual voigt components and perform a non - linear least squares @xmath31 minimization to find the best - fitting value of @xmath3 at each absorption redshift . for the  sample we confirm the w99 result , our new results giving a weighted mean of @xmath32 . for the new ,  sample ,",
    "we find a similar result : @xmath33 .",
    "both results independently suggest a smaller value of @xmath0 in the past . taking the sample as whole we find @xmath34 , a @xmath35 result .",
    "these new results are also summarised in webb et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter w01 ) .",
    "given the potential importance of such a result for fundamental physics , a thorough investigation of possible systematic problems in the data or in the analysis is essential , and this is the purpose of the present paper . in section 2",
    "we list all effects that one might consider as being able to mimic a systematically non - zero @xmath3 .",
    "we are able to exclude many of them with general arguments .",
    "sections 37 are then given over to a more detailed analysis of five specific effects : wavelength mis - calibration , ionic line blending , atmospheric dispersion effects , differential isotopic saturation and possible isotopic variation .",
    "section 8 describes another test which is sensitive to a simple monotonic wavelength distortion , specifically for the  sample .",
    "we make our conclusions in section 9 .",
    "in m01a and w01 we found that values of @xmath3 were systematically negative and that this trend was evident in two different samples of data occupying different redshift regimes .",
    "we note that the  sample is more susceptible to systematic errors than the  sample .",
    "the mgii lines act as anchors against which the larger feii shifts can be measured .",
    "all of the feii lines have similar magnitude shifts in the same direction ( i.e. @xmath21 is large and positive in all cases ) .",
    "furthermore , all the feii lines lie to the blue of the mgii doublet .",
    "if some systematic error in the wavelength scale is present , which effectively _ compresses _ the spectrum , this would mimic a negative shift in the mean value of @xmath3 ( if it were not degenerate with redshift ) .",
    "the  sample is far more complex in this regard since it contains ions not only with positive coefficients , but also with negative @xmath21 coefficients ( i.e. all crii lines and niii @xmath361741 and @xmath361751 ) . also , the shifts for the various ions are of various magnitudes making it more complicated to predict the effect of a systematic error on our measured values of @xmath3",
    ".      errors in the values of @xmath20 will lead directly to errors in any single determination of @xmath3 .",
    "if , for example , the laboratory wavelengths of the mgii lines were all shifted to the blue or red then this would systematically bias the values of @xmath3 for the  sample .",
    "in m01a we summarise the measurements of all values of @xmath20 .",
    "most measurements were repeated independently and good agreement was obtained in those cases .",
    "a typical measurement accuracy from these laboratory measurements @xmath20 of is @xmath37 , which could only introduce a maximum error in @xmath3 around an order of magnitude below the observed deviation from zero . in practice , since we use several transitions ( particularly for the  sample ) , any associated errors are likely to be smaller .",
    "we therefore consider it unlikely that the systematic shift in @xmath3 is due to errors in the values of @xmath20 .",
    "as also noted in m01a , some laboratory spectra were calibrated with the arii lines of norln ( 1973 ) while others were calibrated with those of whaling et al .",
    "the whaling wavenumbers are systematically larger than those of norln such that @xmath38 . to deal with this discrepancy",
    "we have re - scaled those wavenumbers which had been calibrated using the whaling scale ( alii , aliii , siii ) to the norln scale .",
    "we stress that the difference between the norln and whaling wavenumbers is a _ scaling only _ , and not a distortion .",
    "therefore , is it not possible to introduce an apparent deviation in @xmath3 from zero , since small zero - point offsets in the wavelength scale are degenerate with redshift .      during a one hour exposure ,",
    "representative of the quasar integrations for the sample we have used , the heliocentric velocity may change by as much as @xmath39 .",
    "this will act to smear any spectral feature : the instantaneous spectrum is convolved with a top hat function in velocity space .",
    "however , since we fit a redshift parameter to the spectrum when determining @xmath3 then a velocity space smearing is completely absorbed into the redshift parameter .",
    "heliocentric smearing will have no effect on measurements of @xmath3 .",
    "the ions used in our analysis , with the exception of those of al , have naturally occurring isotopes .",
    "thus , each absorption line will be a composite of absorption lines from all the isotopes of a given species . in all cases other than mg and si , the laboratory wavenumbers we have used correspond to _",
    "composite _ values .",
    "the composite wavenumbers will only strictly be applicable in the optically thin regime ( linear part of the curve of growth ) .",
    "as the column density increases , the strongest isotopic component begins to saturate and the line centroid will shift according to the natural abundances ( cf . section [ sec : iso ] ) of the other isotopes .    the mass isotopic shift , being the dominant splitting mechanism for light atoms , is proportional to @xmath40 for @xmath41 the atomic mass .",
    "the wavelength separation between the isotopes is therefore largest for the lighter ( low @xmath21 ) ions .",
    "isotopic separations have been measured for the mgi @xmath362853 transition by hallstadius ( 1979 ) , for mgii @xmath362796 by drullinger et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and the isotopic structure of all mg lines is presented in pickering et al .",
    "however , similar measurements do not exist for the other transitions of interest . for si we used estimates of the isotopic wavenumbers based on a scaling from the basic mg structure by the mass shift . for all other species , measured ( composite )",
    "wavenumbers were used . see m01a for full details .",
    "we discuss and quantify this effect in section [ sec : saturation ] .",
    "in the above we have assumed that the isotopic abundances in the absorption systems are equal to terrestrial values ( table [ tab : iso ] ) .",
    "however , if the isotopic abundances at high redshift are significantly different then this may lead to apparent shifts in the absorption line centroids and this would cause a systematic error in @xmath3 .",
    "again , the most susceptible transitions are those of mg and si since ( i ) these ions will have the largest isotopic separations ( i.e. @xmath41 is low ) and ( ii ) transitions in these atoms are prominent in our data . if , for the  sample , the @xmath42 mg and @xmath43 mg abundances were zero , we would incorrectly infer a more positive @xmath3 by assuming terrestrial isotopic abundances . in the simple case of finding @xmath3 from mgii@xmath362796 and feii@xmath362344 , we would expect to find @xmath44 in the absence of any real variation in @xmath0 .",
    "we consider this possibility in detail in section [ sec : noiso ]      hyperfine splitting of energy levels occurs in species with odd proton or neutron numbers .",
    "different hyperfine components will have different transition probabilities but the composite wavelength of a line will be unchanged by the splitting ( i.e. the centre of gravity of the hyperfine components is constant with increased splitting ) .",
    "however , a similar differential saturation effect will occur for the hyperfine components as discussed in section [ sec : sat ] for the isotopic components .",
    "the worst case here is that of @xmath45al  the only stable isotope of al  since it has an odd proton number and a very large magnetic moment . in the laboratory experiments of griesmann & kling ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the hyperfine structure of the aliii doublet was clearly resolved and can be seen to be quite prominent . however , as noted in m01a , we only include aliii lines in the analysis of 6 absorption systems of our  sample and in these cases we see very little or no saturation . the effect of removing the individual aliii transitions from those systems on @xmath3 can be seen in fig .",
    "4 . in the case of alii @xmath361670 ,",
    "both the ground and excited state have zero spin and the @xmath46-wave hyperfine splitting in the excited state is very small ( cf .",
    "@xmath42 mg in pickering et al .",
    "thus , we do not expect any al hyperfine saturation effects on @xmath3 .",
    "all other dominant isotopes in our analysis have even proton numbers and where odd isotopes occur these have very low abundances ( see table [ tab : iso ] ) . the @xmath42 mg hyperfine structure has already been taken into account in our analysis but the hyperfine separations are so small that neglecting it would make no difference to @xmath3 even upon saturation . the odd isotopes of si , cr , fe , zn and ni have very low abundances . also , si , cr , fe and ni will have very small hyperfine splitting due either to low magnetic moments or to the nature of the ground and excited state wavefunctions .",
    "we therefore expect that differential hyperfine structure saturation has not effected @xmath3 in our analysis .",
    "an unlikely interpretation , given the above , is cosmological evolution of the hyperfine structure constants but very large relative variations would be required .",
    "another possibility is that the populations of the two hyperfine levels of aliii are not equal in the absorption clouds .",
    "since the gas clouds have very low density , the equilibrium between the two hyperfine levels will be maintained predominantly by interaction with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "for the aliii@xmath361862 transition , this implies a lower limit on the relative populations of the two levels of @xmath47 , leading to a shift in the line centroid of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this is a potential problem for the 6 systems in which we fit aliii lines .",
    "we do not consider this effect in detail but we note that fig . 4 in section [ sec : linrem ] shows that potential lack of thermal equilibrium has no significant effect on @xmath3 .",
    "shifting of ionic energy levels due to large magnetic fields may also be a possibility .",
    "if very large scale magnetic fields exist in the intergalactic medium and quasar light is polarized , then this could result in correlated values of @xmath3 in neighbouring regions of the universe .",
    "however , the qsos studied in m01a and w01 cover a large region of the sky .",
    "furthermore , even in abell clusters , intra - cluster magnetic field strengths are typically @xmath50 g ( e.g. feretti et al . 1999 ) , roughly 9 orders of magnitude below the strength required to cause substantial effects .",
    "we consider this possibility to be very unlikely .",
    "an assumption in the analysis of m01a and w01 is that the absorption velocity structure is the same in different species . of course",
    ", if there were some non - zero velocity between , say , the mgii and feii components of a given cloud then we would incorrectly determine @xmath3 .",
    "however , it is difficult to imagine a mechanism by which the mgii is systematically blue or redshifted with respect to the feii when averaged over a large sample of absorption systems .",
    "suppose for example we have an asymmetric , expanding ( or contracting ) , rotating cloud in which all the feii and mgii lie at different ` radii ' .",
    "any large sample of sight lines through such a cloud would yield an average value of @xmath51 . furthermore , if this was a major effect then the observed scatter in the @xmath3 points would be greater than expected on the basis of our @xmath3 error estimates , and in m01a we showed this not to be the case . no matter how contrived the velocity structure and ionic segregation ,",
    "when averaging over a large number of values of @xmath3 , it is not feasible to generate a systematic offset from zero .      there may be inaccuracies in the wavelength calibration software used to reduce the spectra .",
    "also , human error can not be ruled out .",
    "w99 stated that a drift in the wavelength calibration drift by an amount corresponding to roughly @xmath52 times the mean wavelength - pixel residuals over the range of the ccd could result in a significant error in the  results .",
    "a considerably more complicated form of the mis - calibration would be required to produce a systematic error in the  results .",
    "the wavelength calibration of the qso ccd images is done by comparison with thorium  argon ( thar ) lamp exposures taken before and after the qso frames .",
    "we consider errors in the laboratory wavelengths of the selected thar lines to be negligible as their relative values are known to much greater precision than our values of @xmath20 ( palmer & engleman jr .",
    "however , thar line mis - identifications may lead to serious mis - calibration of the wavelength scale over large wavelength regions .",
    "such mis - identifications can also be applied to the rest of the spectra taken over the same series of observations ( i.e. applied to the spectra of many qsos ) .",
    "thus , _ a priori _ , we can not rule out the possibility that the wavelength scale has been set improperly in this process and that a systematic shift in @xmath0 has not been mimicked .",
    "such a potential effect needs careful investigation .",
    "in section [ sec : wavcal ] we discuss and quantify this effect for our data set .",
    "most thar line lists are presented as air wavelengths .",
    "the usual data reduction procedure is to carry out the wavelength calibration fits to the data using air wavelengths and then convert the calibrated spectrum to vacuum wavelengths .",
    "for example , iraf uses air wavelengths for a selection of lines from the thorium spectral atlas of palmer & engleman jr .",
    "( 1983 ) and from the argon lines of norln ( 1973 ) .",
    "the same list is used in makee ",
    "the hires data reduction package written by t. barlow .",
    "makee was used to calibrate 12 of our  sample and the remainder were calibrated within iraf .",
    "the latter were actually calibrated with a set of vacuum wavelengths , @xmath53 , that iraf states is derived from the air wavelengths , @xmath54 , by using the edln ( 1966 ) formula for the refractive index , @xmath55 , @xmath56=8342.13 + \\frac{2406030}{(130 - \\sigma^2 ) } + \\frac{15997}{(38.9 - \\sigma^2)}\\ ] ] at @xmath57 and atmospheric pressure . instead of using @xmath58",
    ", iraf makes the approximation , @xmath59 .",
    "makee converts the final air wavelength calibrated qso frames to vacuum using the cauchy dispersion formula ( weast 1979 ) , @xmath60=2726.43 + \\frac{12.288}{10^{-8}\\lambda_{\\rm air}^2 } + \\frac{0.3555}{10^{-16}\\lambda_{\\rm air}^4}\\ ] ] at @xmath57 and atmospheric pressure . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are both measured in ngstroms in the above equations .",
    "this difference begs the question , what is the absolute and relative accuracy of these conversion formula ?",
    "first let us refine this question .",
    "the measurements reported by palmer & engleman jr . and",
    "norln were all carried out in vacuum .",
    "the air wavelengths they quote are calculated using the edln formula . thus , iraf and makee will only produce ` correct ' vacuum wavelength scales if they invert the edln formula to calculate the refractive index . as stated above ,",
    "this is not the case .",
    "therefore , to re - state the above question , what error does the iraf and makee air ",
    "vacuum wavelength conversion introduce into the resulting qso wavelength scale ? to illustrate the answer to this we plot the various conversion formulae commonly used in the literature , including those discussed above , in fig .",
    "1 . we have also included the original edln ( 1953 ) formula ) but has slightly different parameters : 6432.8 , 2949810 , 146 , 25540 and 41 in order from left to right , numerator to denominator . ] for comparative purposes .",
    "peck & reeder ( 1972 ) published a fit to revised refractive index data , proposing a 4-parameter formula : @xmath61=\\frac{5791817}{(238.0185 - \\sigma^2 ) } + \\frac{167909}{(57.362 - \\sigma^2)}\\ ] ] at @xmath57 and atmospheric pressure with @xmath62 ( again , @xmath53 is in ngstroms ) .",
    "[ fig : compedlen ]    from fig .",
    "1 we see that the cauchy formula seriously deviates from the other formulas . furthermore",
    ", the difference between the edln and cauchy dispersions is strongly wavelength dependent .",
    "thus , spectra calibrated with makee may have systematically non - zero values of @xmath3 due to this distortion .",
    "as we stated in m01a , we have corrected the 12 effected spectra in our ( ) sample by converting the wavelength scale back to air wavelengths using the ( inverted ) cauchy formula and then back to vacuum using the ( inverted ) edln formula . from fig .",
    "1 we can also see that there is only a small distortion to the wavelength scale introduced due to the approximation made within iraf .",
    "this difference is below our level of precision .",
    "the refractive index of air within the spectrograph depends on temperature ( and also on pressure but this is a smaller effect ) .",
    "if a qso spectrum is calibrated with only a single thar exposure taken at a different spectrograph temperature , we expect a systematic mis - calibration of the qso frame s wavelength scale .",
    "consider a qso frame taken at @xmath57 which is calibrated with a thar exposure taken at @xmath63 and similar pressure .",
    "any wavelength separation in the qso exposure will be overestimated .",
    "for example , the difference between the wavelength separations of vacuum @xmath64 and @xmath65 at @xmath57 and @xmath63 is @xmath66 ( using the tables in weast 1979 ) .",
    "a comparison with values of @xmath67 in table 1 of m01a shows that this would result in a significantly positive @xmath3 for the  sample , the situation not being so clear for the  sample .",
    "note that the above effect can only mimic a systematically non - zero @xmath3 if the spectrograph temperature is systematically higher or lower for the thar frames compared with the qso frames .",
    "this is possible if the thar exposures were always taken before or after the qso frames and the temperature evolves monotonically throughout the night .",
    "however , the effect is greatly reduced if thar exposures are taken near the time of the qso observations .",
    "this was the case in our observations .",
    "we have used image header information to calculate the qso  thar temperature difference , @xmath68 , inside hires for both the low and  samples . here the average of @xmath69 and @xmath70 is taken over all exposures for each object .",
    "we find mean values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the low and  samples respectively .",
    "taking into account that , on average , rest - frame separations between transitions are @xmath73 then we can see that temperature variations could not have mimicked any significant shift in @xmath3 in either sample .",
    "the errors in @xmath3 presented in m01a and w01 take into account errors from signal - to - noise and spectral resolution considerations and the velocity structure of the profile fits .",
    "the errors are also reduced when more lines are fitted simultaneously .",
    "however , we have assumed that we have deconvolved each absorption system into the correct number of velocity components .",
    "there may have been weak , interloping , unresolved lines which , if the interloping species were in the same absorption cloud , could have produced a shift in the fitted line wavelengths of all velocity components of one or more transitions .",
    "we distinguish between _ random _ blends and _ systematic _ blends .",
    "_ random _ blends may occur if many absorption clouds at different redshifts intersect the line of sight to a single qso .",
    "systematic _ blend will occur when two species are in the same cloud and have absorption lines with similar rest - wavelengths .",
    "such an effect could mimic a systematic shift in @xmath0 .",
    "the importance of such an effect diminishes as the number of transitions used in each fit is increased .",
    "therefore , the effect , if present , would be expected to be smaller in our  sample .    in section [ sec : sysblend ] we describe the results of a detailed search for atomic ( and not molecular ) interlopers for all transitions of interest , and place constraints on their strengths and positions .      as noted in m01a ,",
    "all of the  sample and many of the high redshift sample of qsos were observed before 1996 august at which time an image rotator was fitted to hires .",
    "objects observed prior to august 1996 were therefore not observed with the slit length ( spatial direction ) perpendicular to the horizon .",
    "atmospheric dispersion leads to a stretching of the target spectrum relative to the calibration spectrum .",
    "an additional consequence is the potential wavelength - dependent truncation of the qso seeing profile on the slit jaw edges .",
    "this can introduce a wavelength dependent asymmetry in the point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "together , these effects can conspire to mimic a non - zero @xmath3 .",
    "we provide detailed calculations for these effects in section 5 and show that they will tend to produce an apparent _ positive _ @xmath3 , and so can not mimic our results .",
    "if the instrumental profile ( ip ) of hires shows significant _ intrinsic _ asymmetries then we expect absorption line centroids to be incorrectly estimated .",
    "if the asymmetry varies with wavelength , this could mimic a non - zero @xmath3 .",
    "valenti , butler & marcy ( 1995 ) have determined the hires ip for several positions along a single order and they find that the ip is indeed asymmetric and that the asymmetry varies slightly along the echelle order .",
    "valenti et al . ( 1995 ) , do not quantify the asymmetry variation across orders although it is likely to be comparable to the variation along the orders .    as a by - product of the detailed investigation into possible wavelength calibration errors , we find that this effect is negligible ( see section [ sec : wavcal ] for details ) .",
    "we have therefore eliminated , with some reliability , potential systematic errors due to : laboratory wavelength errors , heliocentric velocity variation , hyperfine structure effects , magnetic fields , kinematic effects , air  vacuum wavelength conversion errors and temperature changes during observations .    in the following sections we investigate in considerable detail the remaining effects : wavelength mis - calibration ( and instrumental profile variations ) , line blending , atmospheric dispersion effects , differential isotopic saturation and isotopic abundance variation .",
    "we also consider a simple test for any simple but unidentified systematic errors for the  sample in section [ sec : apns ] .",
    "in this section , we investigate the possibility that wavelength calibration errors could have lead to an apparent non - zero @xmath3 . to quantify this directly , we analyse sets of thar emission lines in the calibration lamp spectra in the same way as each set of qso absorption lines has been analysed .",
    "if no calibration error is present then we expect that @xmath74 for all clouds ( i.e. for all @xmath8 ) .      for each qso spectrum , we selected @xmath7515 sections of thar spectra at wavelengths corresponding to the observed absorption lines in the qso spectra .",
    "each thar @xmath7515  section contains several ( typically up to @xmath76 ) lines .",
    "error arrays were generated assuming poisson counting statistics .",
    "we fitted continua to these thar sections , dividing the raw spectra by the continua to obtain normalized spectra .",
    "the main steps in the procedure are then as follows .",
    "we select several independent sets of thar lines .",
    "each set of thar lines therefore corresponds to , and has been selected in an analogous way to , one qso absorption system .    in order to obtain the best estimate of any wavelength calibration errors ,",
    "the average @xmath77 is determined for each thar set ( typically 37 sets for each qso absorption system ) .",
    "the process of defining sets in this way also provides a direct additional estimate of the errors on @xmath77 .    to fit the thar spectra , a modified version of vpfit was used ( to fit gaussian profiles , see m01a ) , adopting thar laboratory wavelengths from palmer & engleman jr .",
    "( 1983 ) for values of @xmath20 in equation [ eq : omega ] .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath22 coefficients for the qso absorption lines are applied to the corresponding thar lines .",
    "that is , we treat the set of thar lines as if they were the qso lines .",
    "the free parameters involved in each fit were line width ( assumed the same for all thar lines in a given set , although the results were insensitive to this assumption ) , ` redshift ' ( numerically close to zero ) and peak intensity .",
    "we applied the above method to each available thar spectrum corresponding to each qso absorption cloud considered and the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "our first observation is that the scatter in these results is an order of magnitude less than that of the qso absorption results themselves .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that wavelength mis - calibration of the ccd has not mimicked a shift in @xmath0 to any significant degree .",
    "the results above also show that the data quality permit a precision of @xmath78 .",
    "[ fig : wavecal ]    secondly , many points in fig . 2 deviate significantly from zero .",
    "there are three possible reasons for this : weak blended emission lines , thar line mis - identifications , and errors in the thar laboratory wavelengths .",
    "inspecting the thar spectra does indeed reveal typically @xmath7520 easily identifiable , but very weak , lines per @xmath79 and we would expect this to add to the scatter in the final results for @xmath77 .",
    "furthermore , this effect would not produce correlated deviations in @xmath77 , as observed .",
    "consistent with this interpretation , we found that the value of @xmath31 per degree of freedom for a fit to a given set of thar lines was @xmath80 . note that if thar line mis - identifications had occurred , one may expect systematically correlated deviations .",
    "finally , we do not expect any significant errors in the thar laboratory wavelengths ( as discussed in section [ sec : wavemiscal ] ) .    on inspection of some of the thar spectra",
    ", we noted that some thar lines towards the blue end of the spectrum were slightly asymmetric .",
    "this may indicate a degradation in the polynomial fits near the edges of the fitting regions .",
    "there may also be intrinsic asymmetries in the ip ( section [ sec : ip ] ) .",
    "if such asymmetry variations exist then they should also apply to the qso spectra .",
    "however , the results in fig . 2 show that such variations do not produce a systematic effect in @xmath3 at any detectable level .",
    "we therefore conclude this section by stating that the results in fig .",
    "2 show unambiguously that wavelength calibration errors and variations in ip asymmetries are not responsible for the observed shifts in @xmath0 in the qso absorption line results .",
    "in this section we suppose there is an unidentified transition , arising from some species in the same gas cloud as is being studied .",
    "we further assume that this interloping transition is not strong enough and/or sufficiently displaced from one of the lines in the analysis , to be detected directly .",
    "we describe two approaches to explore this : in section 4.1 we attempt to identify candidate blending species and in section 4.2 we describe the results of a test where we remove one transition or one species at a time to investigate the impact on @xmath3 .",
    "there are two main parameters which will determine whether or not any particular interloper can give rise to a significant effect in terms of @xmath3 : column density and the position in wavelength with respect to the ` host ' line of interest . in order to search for a potential interloper , we explore the range in parameter space through numerical simulation , generating trial interlopers , blended with a single stronger ` host ' line , and examining the resulting shift in the combined centroid in terms of @xmath3 . having established the allowed characteristics of a potential interloper , we use photoionization equilibrium models to search for candidate atomic species .",
    "we ignore molecular species .",
    "we restrict the following discussion to blending with mgii @xmath362796 , since @xmath3 is particularly sensitive to blending with this anchor line in the  sample .",
    "we later generalize our discussion to include blending with all other relevant transitions .",
    "consider an interloper  a spectral line of a blending species @xmath81  which is separated from the fitted line centroid wavelength , @xmath82 , by @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) in the frame of the cloud .",
    "let the separation between the actual mgii @xmath362796 wavelength and the fitted line position be @xmath85 ( i.e. @xmath86 ) in the frame of the cloud . that is , the line is fit as a single component , despite the presence of the interloper .",
    "the interloper has a column density @xmath87 .",
    "however , as the species @xmath81 is not known _ a priori _ , we may only determine the quantity @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the oscillator strength of the interloping transition .",
    "we generated a synthetic optically thin mg ii @xmath362796 line and matched this against a composite mg ii @xmath362796 profile which included an additional weak blended component , representing our candidate interloper .",
    "the model was fitted to the ` data ' using vpfit .",
    "the synthetic spectrum was generated using a column density of @xmath90 and a @xmath91-parameter of @xmath92 as these were representative values for the mgii lines in m01a and w01 ( churchill 1997 ) .",
    "we restricted the range of @xmath91-parameters for the interloper using the following physical considerations .",
    "if we consider all lines to be thermally broadened then the @xmath91-parameter varies inversely as the square root of the atomic mass .",
    "any species lighter than mg will have a larger @xmath91-parameter . since we are considering @xmath81 to have transitions in the ultraviolet , we may assume that it probably has a mass greater than or comparable to that of mg .",
    "we therefore place an upper limit of @xmath93 .",
    "also , we did not consider any species with atomic number greater than @xmath75100 and so we adopted a lower limit of @xmath94 .    by comparing sets of model and synthetic blended lines in this way , we can constrain the range of possible values of @xmath85 , given some apparent @xmath3 .",
    "we present the results of the simulation in fig . 3 where we define @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath96 .",
    "the ripples on the three surface reflect errors ( @xmath97 in @xmath98 ) introduced due to the restrictive upper limit placed on @xmath99 .",
    "[ fig : nplot ]    using fig .",
    "3 , we can now specify a certain value of @xmath3 ( i.e. we specify @xmath85 ) and an interloping transition of a species @xmath81 ( i.e. we specify @xmath100 ) and find the lower bound on the column density which that species must have in order to have caused the said shift in @xmath3 . for example , if we are concerned with @xmath26 then @xmath101 and the section of fig .",
    "3 with @xmath102 contains information which restricts the candidate interlopers .",
    "given a species , @xmath81 , what is an upper limit on the column density in any given cloud ? to answer this , we modelled the absorption clouds with a grid of cloudy models ( ferland 1993 )",
    ". cloudy estimates the photoionization conditions in absorption clouds by assuming that the cloud can be approximated as a series of zones , in a plane parallel geometry , illuminated by uv radiation from one direction .",
    "the fact that we are trying to model a ( presumably ) spherical cloud with uv flux incident from all sides is expected to introduce abundance errors of order a factor of 2 ( ferland 1993 ) .",
    "photoionization equilibrium is characterized by ( a ) the shape and intensity of the uv spectrum , ( b ) the number density of hydrogen atoms in the cloud , @xmath103 , ( c ) the size of the cloud , which we assume is the same for all species ( the size can be found by specifying @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the neutral hydrogen column density ) and ( d ) the metallicity , @xmath105 , of the cloud .",
    "it is also useful to define the ionization parameter as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the number density of ionizing photons incident on the cloud .",
    "here we follow the work in bergeron & stasiska ( 1986 ) , bechtold et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , steidel & sargent ( 1989 ) and bergeron et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and choose a power law spectrum , @xmath108 , for @xmath109 the incident flux at frequency @xmath110 .",
    "the low and high energy extremes are given by @xmath111 ( for @xmath112 ) and @xmath113 ( for @xmath114 ) .",
    "all the above parameters ( @xmath115 , @xmath103 , @xmath116 and @xmath105 ) , vary from cloud to cloud and are poorly known quantities .",
    "we therefore use a grid of cloudy models to find an upper limit on the column density of a given ionic species using ranges in these parameters as follows .",
    "for @xmath115 we adopt the range @xmath117 in line with the measured range of parameters for those clouds studied in m01a and w01 ( churchill 1997 ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath116 we use @xmath118 . for @xmath105",

    "@xmath103 is the most difficult parameter to constrain . to obtain an estimate of the lower bound",
    ", one may use the method , first suggested by bahcall ( 1967 ) , whereby one places an upper limit on @xmath120 , the number density of protons in the cloud , using the equation , @xmath121 here , @xmath122 is the column density of cii which has been collisionally excited to the state cii@xmath123 .",
    "@xmath124 is the electron number density .",
    "we assume that @xmath125 and that @xmath126 , and so , using @xmath127 and @xmath128 from songaila et al .",

    "we compare our parameter range estimates above with those assumed in lopez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and find that they are consistent after considering the differences between the assumed radiation field .",
    "we present the results of the grid of cloudy models in table 1 where we only give the value of @xmath133 , the maximum value of @xmath98 that occurred in the grid .",
    "we also present the model responsible for this value of @xmath98 .",

    "the most important conclusion of the work described here is that after a detailed search for instrumental and astrophysical effects , we have found no systematic effect which can easily mimic a negative @xmath3 .    of those effects we have identified and explored ,",
    "two systematic effects have been found to be _ potentially _ significant : atmospheric dispersion and isotopic evolution .",
    "if we were to remove these effects from the data , the resulting @xmath3 would actually be _ more negative _ than the uncorrected effect ( see figs . 7 and 8) .",
    "these corrections are _ not _ applied to the data in m01a and w01 because ( i ) our estimates provide _ upper limits _ on the magnitude of the effects , and ( ii ) we prefer to be as conservative as possible as to the significance of the deviation of @xmath3 from zero .",
    "tighter constraints on @xmath0 are possible for realistic snr from current telescopes / spectrographs .",
    "the analyses above indicate that another order of magnitude precision can be gained using our methods before wavelength calibration and laboratory wavelength errors become significant .",
