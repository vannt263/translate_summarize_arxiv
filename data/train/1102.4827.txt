    "<S> a model for violation and even superviolation of the bell s inequalities in coincidence experiments with photons in local quantum mechanics  is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the model is based on assumption that time retardation or losses in an analyzer depend on angle between linear polarization of an incident photon and the analyzer s axis .    * a model of violation and superviolation of bell s inequality in local quantum mechanics *    </S>",
    "<S> vladimir k. ignatovich + frank laboratory for neutron physics , joint institute for nuclear research , dubna , russia 141980    entangled states of separated particles , introduced by  @xcite and  @xcite make quantum mechanics  nonlocal </S>",
    "<S> . this nonlocality is manifested by violation of bell s inequalities certified in many experiments where correlation of particle s polarizations in coincidence experiments were measured . </S>",
    "<S> however below it will be shown that violation of the bell s inequality in coincidence experiments can be obtained even in the local quantum mechanics .    </S>",
    "<S> let s consider an experiment , which scheme is shown in fig.[f1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the source @xmath0 radiates photons assumed to have individual polarizations along some vector @xmath1 , which has uniform angular distribution in the plane orthogonal to propagation direction . </S>",
    "<S> it is the common belief that the bell s inequalities are not violated in such a case . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is shown below that they can be violated , which supports the results of the numerical experiment reported in  @xcite , and more over , in some experiments one can predict even superviolation , where correlation coefficient surpasses the maximal value @xmath2 .    to be specific let s look at the most popular inequality  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a correlation of polarizations of two particles registered after two analyzers with their axes along unit vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 in an experiment depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ f1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the definition of correlation function is the most important part of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> usual definitions involve some predetermined classical functions  @xcite and does not address the specific features of coincidence experiments such as arrival time of particles and time window , which means that the width @xmath8 of the time window is large enough or @xmath9 , and no other particle can enter any of the detectors inside this window .    we suppose that the radiated photons with their individual polarizations interact with analyzers @xmath6 and @xmath7 quantum mechanically , i.e. probability of a photon with polarization @xmath1 to be transmitted through an analyzer with its axis @xmath6 is equal to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are azimuthal angles of vectors @xmath6 and @xmath1 defined with respect to some axis normal to the propagation direction . in the following this axis will be chosen along the vector @xmath6 , so @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath12 will be assumed to have uniform distribution @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the correlation of registrations looks as in  @xcite @xmath15 where , say , @xmath16 is the probability of registration by detectors @xmath17 in coincidence , and @xmath18 is the angle between vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> the analyzers are supposed here to be without losses , and efficiency of registration after analyzers is supposed to be the same for all the detectors . because of definition eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j ] ) this efficiency can be put to unity .    </S>",
    "<S> the probabilities in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j ] ) can be calculated analytically . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath19 where @xmath8 is the width of the coincidence window , @xmath20 are the time delays of the moment of registration and @xmath21 is the step function equal to unity , when inequality in its argument is satisfied , and to zero otherwise .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to calculate all these probabilities and to show for some particular case , @xmath22 , that the inequality @xmath23 can be violated notwithstanding that the photons are not entangled .    in the following , like in  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> it is supposed that the time difference @xmath24 depends on angular distance between vector of photons polarization @xmath1 and axes of analyzers . for instance </S>",
    "<S> , one can suggest that coincidence counting stops , when this angular distance is larger than @xmath25 for some fixed parameter @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> it means that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j1 ] ) can be represented as @xmath27 where @xmath28 correspond to limiting positions @xmath29 of photon polarizations in fig.[f2 ] . for @xmath30 integration interval </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath31 , as is shown in fig.[f2]a ) , and for @xmath32 integration interval is @xmath33 , as is shown in fig.[f2]b ) . if @xmath34 for @xmath35 and a given @xmath26 is denoted as @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is denoted as @xmath38 , then correlation eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ j ] ) takes the form    @xmath39    and the quantity eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1j1 ] ) , as is easy to check , becomes @xmath40 it is understandable that in the limiting case , when @xmath41 , the integration interval in fig.[f2]b ) shrinks to zero , therefore @xmath42 becomes zero too , and @xmath43 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 1j2 ] ) becomes 4 , which is larger than maximal possible value for entangled states @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> so in this case we have superviolation of the bell s inequality .    </S>",
    "<S> dependence of the function @xmath43 on @xmath26 , where the first variable is omitted , is shown in fig.[f3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen from there that @xmath45 up to @xmath46 .    for conclusion </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to tell that all coincidence experiments devoted to verification of violation of bell s inequalities have a preparation stage , when coincidence is tuned . </S>",
    "<S> this preparation stage is never reported . </S>",
    "<S> however this stage can be crucial for `` success '' of the experiments , as follows from the above considerations . </S>"
