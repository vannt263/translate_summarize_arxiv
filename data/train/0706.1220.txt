    "ram pressure and turbulence / viscous stripping by the icm can efficiently remove cold galactic gas and may be responsible for transforming disk galaxies with active star formation into red s0 galaxies ( e.g. , quilis et al . 2000 ) .",
    "stripping of the galactic ism in clusters has been extensively examined in simulations ( e.g. , schulz & struck 2001 , ss01 hereafter ; roediger & hensler 2005 , rh05 hereafter ) , which show that stripping has significant impacts on the properties of galaxies . in the process of stripping ,",
    "the galactic ism is removed from the disk and the outer galactic disk is truncated , while the inner disc is compressed , accompanied by formation of numerous flocculent arms ( ss01 ; rh05 ) .",
    "the galactic sfr is also modified .",
    "compression of disk ism may trigger prodigious star formation ( e.g. , ss01 ; bekki & couch 2003 ; rh05 ) in the first @xmath6 yr of interaction , even though star formation activity will eventually be suppressed as the galactic ism is depleted .",
    "this initial starburst may explain the blue `` butcher - oemler galaxies '' in @xmath70.3 clusters ( butcher & oemler 1978 ) .",
    "the further evolution of the stripped ism from the disk is not clear because of uncertainties in the transport coefficients ( conductivity and viscosity ) .",
    "it has been suggested that some stripped ism may be able to cool to form stars because the main ism heating source , stellar uv radiation , is much weaker in intracluster space ( e.g. , ss01 ) .",
    "therefore , ism stripping in clusters is important for both galaxy evolution and star formation in clusters .",
    "observational evidence of stripping in cluster late - type galaxies has only begun to accumulate in recent years .",

    "second , we examined the number density of emission - line objects from the large area ly@xmath0 survey at @xmath59 ( malhotra & rhoads 2002 ) as they used the narrow - band filters with similar central wavelength and bandwidth ( @xmath8 80 ) to ours .",

    "six emission - line objects were detected ( for a h@xmath0 flux limit of about 6 times shallower than the faintest emission - line object in our sample ) and their follow - up spectroscopic observations showed that five of them were [ oiii ] @xmath505007 emitters at @xmath64 . if we take their number as the number density of @xmath51 [ oiii ] @xmath505007 emitters in the high luminosity and apply a luminosity function with a power index of -1.4 ( e.g. , pascual et al . 2001 ) , the expected number of [ oiii ] emitters in our whole field is @xmath8 0.09 . for our line flux limit ( @xmath65 ergs s@xmath3 @xmath48 ) , the combined number density of the h@xmath52 and the [ oii ] @xmath503727 emitters is at most comparable to that of [ oiii ] @xmath505007 emitters ( e.g. , pascual et al .",

    "( 2007 ) reported two peculiar galaxies in the massive clusters a1689 ( @xmath141 ) and a2667 ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "images reveal stellar trails composed of bright blue knots and fainter streams behind both galaxies extending to 20 kpc and 75 kpc respectively . the fainter galaxy 131124 - 012040 in a1689 has a similar nir luminosity to , although the star formation in the galaxy has stopped @xmath8 100 myr ago .",
    "they argue that these features are produced through tidal interaction with the cluster potential .",
    "however for , there are no stellar trails connecting the hii regions , at least in the current data .",
    "the detected stellar features 6 kpc downstream of the galaxy are confined around the emission - line regions and hardly extend much .",
    "thus , it is unclear how tidal interactions can strip the clouds responsible for the current hii regions and star clusters , yet not produce stellar trails .",
    "future observations , like optical spectroscopy along both axes and  imaging , will allow us to further quantify the dynamical state of  ( e.g. , how dynamically cool is the disk ? ) and the stellar diffuse emission downstream of the galaxy .",
    "the significance of ram pressure stripping in  and the bow - like front of the hii region distribution drive us to consider another formation mechanism for these hii regions , star - formation in the ram - pressure displaced ism clouds .  is undergoing a strong interaction with the surrounding icm , judging by the compactness of the remnant h@xmath0 disk . assuming an ambient icm density of 6@xmath143 @xmath88 and an icm temperature of 6 kev ( see s06 ) , and for a velocity of the galaxy of 1600 km / s ( @xmath144 ) , the thermal pressure is 0.4@xmath145 k @xmath88 , while the ram pressure is 1.1@xmath145 k @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , the ram pressure is high enough to strip 10 k - 100 k ism clouds with density up to 10@xmath71 @xmath88 .",
    "hi gas will be stripped , as well as some less dense dark clouds and the outskirts of molecular clouds , even though the dense cores of molecular clouds may remain in the disk plane .",
    "schaye ( 2004 ) found a critical surface density of @xmath146 @xmath48 for star formation in the outer parts of the galactic disks .",
    "some stripped dense clouds from the disk of  should have higher surface density than this critical value , even if clouds are very clumpy .",
    "thus , the ability of high ram pressure to displace dense clouds from the disk may affect the efficiency of star formation in the stripped ism .",
    "the initial instantaneous stripping can be fast in a high ram pressure environment ( @xmath147 10 myr from rh05 ) , while most materials stripped off the disk still remain bound .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the stripped ism is complicated .",
    "simulations ( vollmer et al .",
    "2001 ; ss01 ; rh05 ) show that a fraction of stripped materials ( mainly from the outer disk , @xmath8 10% from rh05 ) can still be bound in the galactic halo ( the `` hang - up '' effect ) for a few 100 myr even in a high ram pressure environment .",
    "some material may even fall back to the disk , while most of the stripped ism concentrates within several galaxy diameters downstream , in the lee of the galaxy where the ram pressure is reduced ( e.g. , ss01 ) .",
    "the details of the process rely on many factors , for example , the porosity of the ism in the inner disk or the effective ram pressure downstream of the galaxy , the halo potential , and the efficiency of heat conduction and viscosity .",
    "simulations ( rh05 ; roediger , brggen & hoeft 2006 ) also show that the wake can be very turbulent .",
    "the stripped clouds will collide with each other , which may produce shocks and trigger star formation .",
    "moreover , being in the halo separates them from the strong stellar uv heating flux present in the disk , allowing cooling to be dominant .",
    "thus , star formation may proceed in the halo or even in unbound clouds far away from the galaxy ( e.g. , elo8 and 9 ) .",
    "we notice that oosterloo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) reported that two intergalactic hii regions at least 100 kpc from the nearest galaxy ( an elliptical ) are in a massive isolated hi cloud .",
    "hii regions in hi clouds were also reported in stephan s quintet by mendes de oliveira et al .",
    "thus , star formation in isolated hi clouds is plausible , although the efficiency may be low as suggested by oosterloo & van gorkom ( 2005 ) .",
    "this scenario can explain the spatial distribution of the hii regions although the details are certainly complicated .",
    "ss01 even suggested formation of dwarf galaxies by these means .",
    "we indeed notice that the brightest hii region , elo1 , has an estimated total mass of @xmath148 m@xmath5 .",
    "if star formation in elo1 is still active , elo1 may grow into a dwarf galaxy eventually .",
    "future  and high - resolution hi observations are required to better understand elo1 , other bright hii regions and the stripped ism .",
    "the estimated ages of the hii regions are less than @xmath8 8 myr .",
    "the length of the x - ray tail implies that stripping has lasted for @xmath8 50 myr ( assuming a velocity of @xmath8 1500 km / s in the plane of the sky ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that many hii regions may have already faded .",
    "nevertheless , the long spatial distribution of the hii regions along the tail implies that after the ism has been stripped , the time lapse to the beginning of star formation spans a range up to @xmath8 20 myr or more ( e.g. , for elo8 and 9 ) .",
    "contrary to elo8 and 9 , some luminous hii regions ( e.g. , elo1 - elo3 ) are only @xmath8 1.6 - 5 kpc from the galactic disk in projection , but their ages are comparable to those of elo8 and 9 ( if not longer ) .",
    "their estimated ages are longer than the required time to produce the observed projected offsets .",
    "thus , this may be the evidence that a significant part of stripped ism from the disk can still be bound in the halo .",
    "we also explore the possibility of detecting faded hii regions from the imaging data .",
    "the six additional emission - line regions selected with looser criteria ( fig .",
    "2 ) are certainly candidates with stronger @xmath26 band continuum .",
    "they are also close to the 29 hii regions .",
    "the embedded star clusters are blue if the intrinsic extinction is not too high . from starburst99 model , we find that star clusters like those in elo1 - 3 should be detected in @xmath28 and @xmath26 bands with our data , even at ages of 50 - 60 myr .",
    "however , it is difficult to distinguish them from the various types of galactic stars in the foreground .",
    "about 10 myr after the initial starburst , red supergiants appear and the galactic colors are highly metallicity dependent over this period . for star clusters with metallicities larger than 0.4 solar , starburst99 also predicts a big increase for the @xmath49 color at @xmath8 10 myr for instantaneous starbursts .",
    "@xmath49 color can be as high as 1.7 mag in that period , which makes it almost impossible to select them from galactic stars with imaging data alone ( fig .",
    "2 ) . in fact , ten non - emission - line objects with @xmath149 0.8 mag ( fig .",
    "2 ) are mostly bright stars and none of them are close to the tail .",
    "thus , faded hii regions may be selected only through a spectroscopic survey .",
    "if formation of massive stars proceeds in the stripped ism , high - mass x - ray binaries may form in those star clusters .",
    "the existing shallow ( 14 ks ) observation reveals only three hard x - ray point sources in the tail ( @xmath150 ergs s@xmath3 if in a3627 ) , but both the  and the  spectra reveal an unresolved hard component in the tail ( s06 ) .",
    "interestingly , the brightest  point source p1 ( s06 ) is only @xmath77 from the putative hii region elo5 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , while the combined positional uncertainty from  and the soar data can be up to @xmath151 .",
    "the  point source p3 positionally coincides with a red optical source ( @xmath120=3.2 ) with an h@xmath0 - h@xmath1 color of 0.01 , which is likely a star .",
    "the  point source p2 is 0.7@xmath152 from two star - like objects , but only 2.5@xmath23 away from an emission - line object candidate ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we have a 150 ksec  acis - s observation approved for cycle 9 , which can probe the x - ray point source distribution 20 times deeper than the existed data .",
    "the  data strongly imply a connection between stripping of the ism and star formation in the halo and intracluster space .",
    "the stripped ism not only contributes to the icm , but also adds intracluster light by subsequent star formation after stripping .",
    "the total mass of starbursts in the 29 hii regions is about 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 ( with large uncertainty from age and extinction ) , while the total gas mass of the h@xmath0 tail and the x - ray tail is @xmath153 m@xmath5 ( depending on the filling factor and density variation ) .",
    "as many hii regions may have already faded and star formation may still proceed in the stripped ism , the final total stellar mass formed in the halo and intracluster space should be at least several times larger than the 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 estimated above . as most of hii regions may still be in the halo , it is possible that star formation in stripped ism is more efficient in the halo than in intracluster space . for",
    "the star clusters in the halo , some of them may remain bound , while others may escape the galactic potential through tidal interactions .",
    "thus , this single transforming galaxy  contributes over 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 of new stars in the halo and intracluster space through star formation in the ram - pressure displaced clouds , although it is unclear how many will end in intracluster space .",
    "if some large star clusters are bound to the galaxy for a significant amount of time , the configuration may look like galaxy aggregates found in the coma cluster ( conselice & gallagher 1998 ) .",
    "there are not many cluster galaxies with known h@xmath0 tails , two irregular galaxies in the northwest of a1367 ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2001 ) , ngc  4388 in the virgo cluster ( yoshida et al . 2002 ; 2004 ) , a post - starburst galaxy near the center of the coma cluster ( yagi et al .",
    "2007 ) , and several galaxies in an infalling compact group towards a1367 ( sakai et al . 2002 ; gavazzi et al . 2003",
    "; cortese et al . 2006 ) .",
    "both galaxies in the northwest of a1367 and the post - starburst galaxy in coma have similar @xmath113-band absolute magnitudes as s ( from 0.49 mag fainter to 0.10 mag brighter ) , implying similar total stellar mass as s .",
    "ngc  4388 is 1.3 mag more luminous than  in the @xmath113 band and also larger . both h@xmath0 tails in a1367",
    "are suggested to be produced by ram pressure stripping , while the tidal interaction between the two galaxies may trigger star formation in both galaxies ( gavazzi et al .",
    "the h@xmath0 tail behind the galaxy d100 in coma is remarkably narrow and straight ( 60 kpc @xmath154 kpc ) .",
    "it may be produced through either ram pressure stripping , or comes from the gas of a merging dwarf ( yagi et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 filaments in the northeast of ngc  4388 are suggested to be ionized by ngc  4388 s agn , while ram pressure stripping of the ism provides the cool gas trail ( yoshida et al .",
    "the remarkable infalling compact group in a1367 is composed of several giant galaxies , many dwarf galaxies and h@xmath0-emitting knots .",
    "we notice that the @xmath28 band absolute magnitude of the elo1 ( before correction on the intrinsic extinction ) is comparable to the faint dwarf galaxies in that infalling group ( m@xmath155 = -15.3 mag compared to -15.8 mag ) .",
    "cortese et al . ( 2006 ) suggested that the rich star formation phenomena in this infalling group is triggered by tidal interactions between group members and the ram pressure by the icm .",
    "the galaxy c153 in a2125 ( @xmath12=0.247 ) is another similar case ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ; owen et al .",
    "2006 ) , with a wide 80 kpc [ oii ] tail that is also likely shown in the x - rays .",
    "the galaxy has a distorted disk with substantial star formation activity , just when it is penetrating the cluster core .",
    "however , it is far more distant than all other galaxies discussed here so the interaction can not be studied in the same detail as others .",
    "there are no detections of x - ray tails behind the other galaxies with h@xmath0 tails in the  or  data .",
    "there are also no reports of isolated hii regions near the two galaxies in the northwest of a1367 and d100 in coma .",
    "the spectroscopically confirmed hii region by gerhard et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is north of ngc  4388 but is far away from the h@xmath0 filaments revealed by yoshida et al .",
    "other emission - line objects in that part of the virgo cluster are even farther away from the h@xmath0 filaments ( fig . 1 of okamura et al .",
    "2002 ) . how does the h@xmath0 tail of  form ?",
    "the net h@xmath0 image of the galaxy shows the truncation of the h@xmath0 emission on the front and the sides ( fig . 1 and fig . 6 ) .",
    "in fact , the leading edge of the x - ray emission in  coincides positionally with the h@xmath0 front .",
    "the compactness of the remaining h@xmath0 core demonstrates the strength of the icm wind . compared with simulations by roediger & hensler ( 2005 ) , over 90% of the gas in the original gas disk",
    "should have been removed from the disk , either hanging up in the halo or in the tail .",
    "thus , ram pressure stripping should play an important role in the formation of the observed h@xmath0 tail .",
    "the stellar ionization field in the tail may be too weak to ionize the stripped cold gas to produce the observed h@xmath0 tail , at least from the current data .",
    "the positional coincidence of the h@xmath0 tail and the x - ray tail implies a connection .",
    "can heat conduction from the surrounding icm to the cold stripped ism provide enough energy ?",
    "heat conduction across the embedded cold clouds is most likely saturated .",
    "we use the saturated heat conductivity derived by cowie & mckee ( 1977 ) to estimate the flow - in heat flux . the surface area",
    "is still estimated from a cylinder with a 3.5 kpc diameter and a 40 kpc length ( @xmath335 ) , although the real contact surface is almost certainly higher ( e.g. , for clumpy clouds ) .",
    "the total heat luminosity is 4.7@xmath156 ergs s@xmath3 , for an icm temperature of 6.5 kev and an icm density of 10@xmath157 @xmath158 .",
    "although the energy emitted through h@xmath0 is only a small fraction of the total optical line cooling ( several percent from voit , donahue & slavin 1994 ) , there is enough heat energy for the observed h@xmath0 tail .",
    "however , heat conduction can be largely suppressed by magnetic field at the boundaries of the clouds .",
    "it is likely that both stripping and heat conduction contribute to the observed h@xmath0 tail .",
    "spectroscopic studies of the h@xmath0 tail , though difficult , will better clarify its nature .",
    "radio observations are also required to study the distribution of the cold atomic and molecular gas in and behind .",

    "we present optical imaging and spectroscopic data of  from soar and the ctio 1.5 m telescopes .",
    "an h@xmath0 tail is found behind , extending to at least 40 kpc from the galaxy .",
    "the h@xmath0 tail positionally coincides with the x - ray tail .",
    "we conclude that ram pressure stripping is responsible for the ism tail , while heat conduction from the hot icm may also contribute to the energy of the optical lines .",
    "this discovery makes  the only known cluster galaxy with an x - ray tail and an h@xmath0 tail .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission in  is confined to the central @xmath8 1 kpc ( radius ) region .",
    "the current nuclear sfr ( @xmath8 1.2 m@xmath5/yr ) and the largely enhanced stellar continuum ( after correction of intrinsic extinction ) around the center imply that a galactic bulge may be building up .",
    "at least 29 emission - line objects with high h@xmath0 flux are also revealed by the data .",
    "they all spatially cluster downstream of the galaxy , in or around the stripped ism tail . those closest to the galactic disk form a bow - like front . from analysis of the h@xmath1 frame and the estimate of the background emission - line objects ,",
    "we conclude that the expected number of background objects is much less than one in the whole 3.43@xmath40 field and all 29 emission - line objects are very likely hii regions associated with .",
    "the high number density and luminosities of these hii regions downstream of  dwarf the previously known examples of isolated hii regions in clusters , making a dramatic example full of rich phenomena .",
    "interestingly , one point source ( an ulx with @xmath159 ergs s@xmath3 if in a3627 ) is in the same position as an hii region .",
    "all these detections indicate significant star formation activity in the halo of  and in intracluster space .",
    "our data imply a connection between these hii regions and the stripping of the ism .",
    "we suggest that star formation may proceed in the stripped ism , in both the galactic halo and the intracluster space .",
    "the star formation in the halo may have a higher efficiency as the stripped ism is still bound .",
    "cooling can become dominant when the surrounding uv radiation field is much weaker than in the disk .",
    "cloud collisions may also induce collapse of the ism clouds .",
    "the total mass of the current starbursts in these 29 hii regions is about 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 .",
    "since many hii regions and star clusters may have already faded , the total stellar mass formed in the stripped ism may be several times higher .",

    "there is no reason to believe  is unique .",
