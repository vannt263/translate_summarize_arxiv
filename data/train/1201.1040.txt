    "x - ray plasma ejections ( xpes ) are sudden expulsions of hot magnetized plasma in the solar corona seen in x - rays . they establish a wide range of macroscopic motions showing different morphology , kinematics and physical conditions .",
    "xpes occur usually during the impulsive phase of flares , but their connection with other solar - activity phenomena like : coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , prominences , radio bursts , coronal dimmings , global waves is also known .",
    "there are some restrictions in calling any motions in the corona around the flare times as xpes .",
    "the restrictions regard the size , duration , brightness , speed , etc . and",
    "are introduced mainly by spatial , temporal and spectral resolutions of imaging instruments and their operational schemes .",
    "xpes have been systematically observed since 1991 when _ yohkoh _ satellite began to operate .",
    "they became commonly known since the paper written by @xcite was published .",
    "however , we note earlier articles on essentially the same phenomena from the _ solar maximum mission _ @xcite and from _ yohkoh _ @xcite . until now images recorded by the",
    "_ yohkoh _ soft x - ray telescope , sxt @xcite are the largest database of xpes , even though the newer solar x - ray imaging instruments operate , e.g. , _ goes _ solar x - ray imager , _ reuven ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager _",
    "( _ rhessi _ ) , _ hinode _ x - ray telescope .",
    "detailed analyses of individual xpes were performed first by @xcite and @xcite . in these papers",
    "the authors determined values of physical parameters describing an xpe using temperature and emission measure maps obtained from sxt images .",
    "the maps allowed them to investigate overall magnetic configuration including a flare loop and a reconnection region .",
    "they also used hard x - ray light curves , derived by the _ yohkoh _",
    "hard x - ray telescope , hxt @xcite , for a detailed description of reconnection timing .",
    "@xcite made the first attempt to correlate xpes and cmes . for 17 well - observed limb flares they found that flares associated with cmes",
    "show xpes and opposite  flares not associated with cmes also lack xpes",
    ". a more extensive investigation of association between xpes and flares was performed by @xcite . for 57 well - observed limb flares they found that almost 70% show xpes .",
    "they also reported dependence on x - ray class , namely the association is larger for stronger flares , but it could be caused by observational biases .    to investigate interesting examples of xpes other _",
    "yohkoh _ instruments also have been used , namely the hxt @xcite and the bragg crystal spectrometer , bcs @xcite . in both papers",
    "a special location of investigated events has been chosen .",
    "these xpes occurred far behind the solar limb and due to their fast expansion they came into the view of an instrument before brighter flares , which expand slower .",
    "it is virtually the only way for using full - sun instruments like the bcs to resolve faint soft x - ray emission of xpes .",
    "the behind - the - limb location also protects against strong emission of footpoint hard x - ray sources of flares , which usually dominate fainter coronal emission .",
    "the obtained results proved that an xpe can conatin energetic non - thermal electrons @xcite and superhot thermal plasma @xcite .",
    "an important progress in investigation of xpes gave a trilogy made by @xcite .",
    "they investigated systematically sxt observations obtained during a two - year interval and found 137 xpes .",
    "the events were a subject of multipurpose analysis ",
    "the authors introduced a morphological classification of xpes , investigated their kinematics , specified the association with flares and cmes .",
    "the present name of xpes also comes from these papers .",
    "we recapitulate the results of kim et al . in details in further sections , where we compare them to our results .",
    "more recently , an association between xpes and radio events and prominences has been investigated . in statistical surveys @xcite studied type ii radio bursts , whereas @xcite studied drifting pulsating structures ( dps ) .",
    "both surveys suggest a kind of connection between xpes and radio events but further examinations are needed to establish the connection .",
    "the relationship between hot ( xpes ) and cold ( prominences ) ejections was discussed by @xcite for single events , which was followed up with statistical studies @xcite .    finally , in our short review illustrating a research progress we would like to recall the two following papers .",
    "firstly , the results of a quantitative analysis of sxt images describing time evolution of basic physical parameters for 12 xpes were given by @xcite .",
    "secondly , after extensive analysis of a complex xpe that consisted of several recurrent episodes , @xcite reported a close connection between sequential ejections and successive hard x - ray bursts .",
    "the most commonly accepted physical explanation of xpes connects these phenomena directly with flare magnetic reconnection .",
    "@xcite regarded xpes as a proof of the presence of plasmoids driven by magnetic reconnection occurring above a soft x - ray loop in short - duration , compact - loop flares similar to the _ canonical _ 2d cshkp model ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , which was proposed for long - term , two - ribbon flares .",
    "in this way , @xcite postulated a unification of two observationally distinct classes of flares , i.e. two - ribbon flares and compact - loop flares , by a single mechanism of magnetic reconnection called the _ plasmoid - induced - reconnection model_.    the first qualitative studies of individual events @xcite reported that the measured velocities of xpes are much smaller than the velocity of reconnection outflow expected from the model to be about the alfv@xmath0n speed . to reconcile this discrepancy",
    "the authors suggested : ( 1 ) the high density of the xpes , ( 2 ) the time evolution effect ( i.e. , the plasmoid should be accelerated as it propagates , thus the investigated xpes have not yet reached the maximum velocity ) , or ( 3 ) an interaction with coronal magnetic fields overlying the xpes .",
    "although more recently , 2d resistive - mhd numerical simulations of the reconnection explain kinematical properties of various observational features attributed to the current - sheet plasmoids @xcite , it has been expected that 3d reconnection renders a more realistic description of eruptive phenomena .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested 3d quadrupolar reconnection of two loop systems that appear to exchange their footpoints as a result of loop - loop interaction @xcite .    on the other hand , in some cases the xpes seem to play the same role as phenomena called precursors of cmes @xcite .",
    "this opinion is supported observationally by common kinematical evolution of xpes and cmes @xcite as well as their morphological resemblance @xcite .",
    "if so , loss of equilibrium or mhd instability , commonly accepted as one of the cme triggering mechanism @xcite , also should be taken seriously into consideration as a cause of xpes .",
    "reports concerning xpe observations in the sxt database were scattered until now across many different sources : refereed articles , conference communications , electronic bulletins , etc .",
    "an exception was the survey given by @xcite , which includes almost all the xpes associated with limb flares for a two - years interval .",
    "our motivation was to ingest all available reports in one catalogue and organize them in a uniform way for an easy usage .",
    "we have examined sxt images in those time intervals , in which any systematic searches of xpes did not perform .",
    "knowledge about xpes has so far been shaped by a limited number of events that have repeatedly appeared in the literature .",
    "our catalogue is meant to serve as a convenient tool for every scientist who wants to better understand the nature of xpes .",
    "the catalogue contains the all xpes we know that were observed by the sxt during the entire _ yohkoh _ operations , i.e. between 1991 october 1 and 2001 december 14 .",
    "there are three main surveys of events that we used in our catalogue :    1 .",
    "@xcite , which contains 137 limb events , observed between 1999 april and 2001 march .",
    "2 .   ohyama ( 2009 , private communication ) with 53 limb events that occurred between 1991 october and 1998 august .",
    "the survey was prepared for the aim of statistical research @xcite , but it was not published .",
    "3 .   @xcite , which reports 113 events , observed basically within two time intervals : 1998 september  1999 march and 2001 april  2001 december that were not systematically searched before .",
    "we also incorporated 65 xpes reported in other scientific papers as well as in the electronic bulletin _ yohkoh sxt science nuggets_.    keeping in mind the examination of sxt images made by different authors , we can conclude that the list of xpes associated with limb flares ( defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is heliographic longitude ) is almost complete . on the other hand ,",
    "the list of xpes associated with disk flares is largely incomplete , with the exception of time intervals examined by @xcite .",
    "occasional reports of xpes not associated with any flares @xcite teach us that the sxt images made without any flares should be also examined and this work still awaits to be done .    in summary ,",
    "our catalogue contains 368 events .",
    "time frequency of xpes occurrence during the _ yohkoh _ mission is given in fig .",
    "[ occ ] , where sizes of bins are 6 or 3 months for years 1991 - 1997 and 1998 - 2001 , respectively .",
    "this traces variability of general solar activity .",
    "a larger occurrence rate in cycle 23 in comparison with cycle 22 may be attributable to the revision of the sxt flare mode observing sequences .",
    "indeed , the ratio of the number of xpes and that of flares taken from the _ solar - geophysical data _ ( sgd ) is 3.6 times greater for solar cycle 23 than for cycle 22 .    before 1997",
    ", a routine scheme of observations during the flare mode was dominated by images in which the exposure time and the position of the field of view ( typically 2.5@xmath32.5 arcmin@xmath4 ) were automatically adjusted by the signals and locations of the brightest pixels .",
    "xpes are distinctly fainter and located higher in the corona than flares .",
    "thus , they had usually too poor statistics during short exposure times and due to a fast expansion they left immediately the narrow field of view . under these circumstances , xpes were rarely well - observed .    in 1997 ,",
    "the frequency of images with sufficiently long and constant exposures and broader field - of - view ( 5.2 @xmath3 5.2 arcmin@xmath4 and 10.5 @xmath3 10.5 arcmin@xmath4 ) was increased to every 10 - 20 s @xcite .",
    "this observational scheme worked more favorably for the xpes identification , however flare structures seen in those images often suffer from heavy saturation that manifests itself as vertical spikes disturbing a picture of xpes .",
    "we registered events to the catalogue on the basis of the sxt observations exclusively .",
    "for this reason , we omitted some x - ray ejections from years 1991 - 2001 identified using observations made with other instruments alone , like the hxt , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the online catalogue resides at http://www.astro.uni.wroc.pl/xpe/catalogue.html since 2010 october 22 .",
    "it is also linked from the _ yohkoh _ legacy data archive @xcite .",
    "the general arrangement of the catalogue as a matrix of years and months of observation is presented in fig .",
    "[ mentry]a . after clicking the month ,",
    "each xpe is identified by a chronological catalogue number , date , and time of occurrence .",
    "the letter ( a ) added to a start time means that the xpe began earlier than shown in the available movies . the letter ( b )",
    "added to an end time means that the xpe finished later than shown in the available movies .",
    "the letter ( c ) added to an end time means a time interval of available movies in which we can not identify the xpe reported earlier by other authors .",
    "each events has links to five entries that provide detailed information on the xpe , flare ( sxr and hxr ) , cme , and references on the xpe ( see an example in fig .  [",
    "mentry]b ) .",
    "this entry contains 8 columns labeled as follows : ( 1 ) event i d , ( 2 ) date , ( 3 ) time , ( 4 ) quality , ( 5 ) classification , ( 6 ) movies , ( 7 ) results of analysis , and ( 8) references ( see an example in ( fig .  [",
    "mentry]c ) .",
    "the first three columns are replicated from the higher entry .    in col .",
    "( 4 ) , we indicate the quality of available sxt observations by assigning one letter between ( a ) and ( d ) .",
    "the letter ( a ) means the highest quality : an xpe is clearly seen and only slightly disturbed by flare saturation , observations have almost full spatial and time coverage , images are made by at least two different filters . in conclusion ,",
    "events with this letter are a good source for any kind of quantitative analysis including plasma diagnostics on the basis of the filter - ratio method @xcite .",
    "the letter ( b ) also means quite good quality of observations , but the usage of only a one filter in some cases makes a plasma diagnostics unavailable .",
    "nevertheless , xpes marked with this letter are always good for kinematical studies .",
    "the letter ( c ) means poor quality for some of the following reasons : the brightness of the xpe only marginally above the background , short observation window , inadequate field - of - view , or strong effect from flare saturation . for events with this letter",
    "only limited analyses are usually possible , e.g. a description with our 3-parameters classification . the letter ( d )",
    "is designed for xpes , which were mentioned by other authors but whose presence is not confirmed in the movies that we made .    in col .",
    "( 5 ) we characterize general observational features of xpes using a new classification scheme that we have developed in this catalogue . in our classification",
    "we define three criteria considering : ( a ) morphology of an xpe , ( b ) its kinematics , and ( c ) recurrence . examining each criterion",
    "we distinguish two subclasses of events only : ( a ) 1  collimated , 2  loop - like ; ( b ) 1  confined , 2  eruptive ; ( c ) 1  single , 2  recurrent . in consequence , our classification can resolve @xmath5 subclasses .",
    "our motivation should be commented in the context of the earlier classification made by @xcite , who proposed 5 morphological groups of xpes : a loop - type , spray - type , jet - type , confined , and other . in our opinion ,",
    "the classification that is too ` hair - splitting ' may be uncomfortable in practical usage because it is easy to make a wrong assignment in case of poor quality of the observational data or their limited coverage .",
    "we may recall attempts of organizing properties of cmes as observed by different coronagraphs @xcite .",
    "they have never worked out any commonly accepted classification scheme for cmes on the basis of morphological features only .",
    "our morphological criterion resolves only a direction of soft x - ray plasma movement in comparison with the direction of local magnetic field . roughly speaking , in the case of the subclass 1",
    "the direction is parallel i.e. along the already existing magnetic field lines , in the case of the subclass 2  perpendicular i.e. across the already existing lines ( or strictly speaking  together with them ) .",
    "xpes from the first morphological subclass usually take a form of a blob or a column of matter propagating within a bundle of magnetic lines without any serious modification of their structure",
    ". therefore , these events are more collimated ( hence its name ) and less energetic .",
    "a direction of their motions depends on the configuration of guiding lines .",
    "our subclass 1 comprises the majority of events classified by @xcite as the spray - type and jet - type events .",
    "xpes from the second morphological subclass take a form of a rising loop or a system of loops .",
    "our subclass 2 is very similar to the loop - type events proposed by @xcite .",
    "some events showed features of both morphological subclasses , 1 and 2 , in this case we classified them according to a more evident feature .",
    "for the xpe assignment into one of the kinematical subclasses we have chosen height increase rate above the chromosphere , @xmath6 .",
    "a negative value , @xmath7 , means the subclass 1 , the opposite case , @xmath8 means the subclass 2 .",
    "there are several papers presenting plots @xmath9 for events belonging to both subclasses @xcite .",
    "xpes from the first kinematical subclass can be connected with plasma motion within closed magnetic structures as well as with some changes in a plasma situation or in the local magnetic field structure which do not evacuate any mass from the sun . in summary ,",
    "xpes from the first kinematical subclass suggest the presence of kind of magnetic or gravitational confinement of x - ray plasma . for xpes from the second kinematical subclass ,",
    "an increasing velocity in the radial direction in the field of view of the sxt allows us to anticipate further expansion leading to irreversible changes ( eruption ) of the local magnetic field . in consequence , at least a part of the plasma escapes from the sun .    for many weak xpes",
    "a construction of the diagram @xmath10 vs. @xmath11 was impossible .",
    "therefore , we estimated @xmath12 qualitatively by watching the expansion rate of xpes in movies made with images uniformly spaced in time . in some cases",
    "the classification was problematic because of a limited coverage of available observations , hence we added a question mark to the digit for this criterion .",
    "according to our third criterion we separate disposable , unique xpes that occurred once in a time ( subclass 1 ) from recurrent events for which following expanding structures can be seen with time ( subclass 2 ) .",
    "the majority of xpes described in the literature belongs to the subclass 1 , however samples of the subclass 2 were already presented @xcite .",
    "a partial time coverage of the available observations probably introduces a bias toward single xpes , because a narrow observational window allows us to resolve only a single feature even for recurrent xpes .",
    "especially important is col .",
    "( 6 ) in which all available movies illustrating evolution of the xpe are collected .",
    "the movies consist of images obtained by the sxt and are written in the mpeg format .",
    "images made by using particular filters and spatial resolutions are collected in separate movies .",
    "we label the movies to indicate their contents , e.g. , almg / hn marks images obtained with the almg filter of half resolution .",
    "we use the following standard annotations of filters and spatial resolutions applied in the _ yohkoh _ software @xcite : the filter al.1  the wavelength range 2.5 - 36   , almg  2.4 - 32   , mg3  2.4 - 23   , al12  2.4 - 13   , be119  2.3 - 10   ; the full resolution , fn ,  2.45 arcsec , half resolution , hn , ",
    "4.9 arcsec , quarter resolution , qn ,  9.8 arcsec .",

    "sometimes we divided images made with the same filter and the same spatial resolution onto separate movies consisting of images made with the same time exposition . in that case , the labels contain additionally successive roman digits .",
    "the movies consist of images that we previously processed using the standard _ yohkoh _",
    "routine sxt_prep , allowing us to reduce an influence of typical instrumental biases , e.g. telemetry compression , electronic offset , dark current , straylight , de - jittering . in the images",

    "the `` sxr flare '' entry contains a basic info about a flare that was associated with the given xpe . finding the associated flare for the majority of xpes in the catalogue was very easy .",

    "a flare occurred simultaneously with an xpe but in another active region .",

    "some useful characteristics of xpes included in the catalogue are extracted in table  [ tb1 ] . in this subsection",
    "we discuss general statistics of the catalogue content .    in table[tb2 ] the quality of xpe observations from the catalogue",
    "is summarized .",
    "the most frequent are events that we categorized as ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "contribution of remaining categories is marginal . in sections[ass - fl ] and [ ass - cme ] we present results of a statistical analysis that was performed for two different populations of events : from ( a ) to ( c ) and from ( a ) to ( b ) .",
    "the first population is more frequent , which offers some advantages in statistical approach , however for events categorized as ( c ) observations are often not complete enough to give confidence in our classification choices . in consequence , in the first population an additional bias can be introduced which is inadvisable .",
    "we expect that this problem is overcome for less frequent , second population of xpes which was better observed .    in table[tb3 ]",
    "we summarize heliographic longitudes of xpes in the catalogue . a distinct concentration of the xpes around the solar limb is seen .",
    "this is an artificial effect caused by observational constrains .",
    "xpes are easier for detection when we observe them against the dark background sky than when we observe them between plenty of different features seen on the solar disk . moreover , in two from three main surveys that we used in our catalogue ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ohyama 2009 , private communication ) , only flares that occurred close to the solar limb ( @xmath1 ) were systematically reviewed .",
    "is it possible to estimate the actual number of xpes , which occurred on the sun during the _ yohkoh _ years ? assuming their uniform distribution with heliographic longitude and taking the number for the interval @xmath15 as the most representative , we obtain a value @xmath16 . including a duty time of _ yohkoh _ to be about 0.65 ( ratio of satellite day to the total orbital period ) we obtain a number @xmath17 .",
    "however , even this huge number could be significantly lower than actual due to several reasons .",
    "firstly , we do not include an influence of worse detection conditions before 1997 .",
    "secondly , for strong flares , especially in 2001 , the conditions for detecting xpes were quite bad because of too long exposures .",
    "thirdly , the estimated number is roughly representative for flares stronger than the _ goes _ class c5-c6 . only for those events",
    "the flare mode was initiated in the _ yohkoh _ operation @xcite and this mode guarantees a sufficient time resolution of an image cadence for a successful detection of xpes .",
    "xpes associated with weaker flares are only known accidentally , since no systematic examination of images recorded during the quiet mode of the _ yohkoh _ satellite has been performed yet .    in conclusion",
    ", xpes should be considered as very frequent events occurring in the solar corona .",
    "xpes described in the catalogue are only a minor representation of a countless population of events , which are typical for the hot solar corona .    in table[tb4 ]",
    "we present a time coverage of the observed xpes .",
    "evolution of an important fraction of events ( 42.6% ) is illustrated only partially .",
    "this limits its detailed investigation .",
    "even relatively simple activities like classification can be meaningless .",
    "for example , xpes classified as single and observed only partially can be actually recurrent .    in table[tb5",
    "] we present a number of xpes that were classified onto one of eight subclasses defined under following three criteria : morphological , kinematical , and recurrence .",
    "we organize the results twofold : for the total population and for carefully selected events . in the second case we omitted events categorized as ( c ) , untrustworthy assignments of kinematical criterion as shown in the catalogue with the question mark , and examples classified as single in case of partial time - coverage of observations .",
    "it reduces the whole population almost three times and for particular subclasses even more , but we believe that numbers less affected by observational limits , seen in the last column of table[tb5 ] , are more representative for real conditions .    what do these numbers tell us about xpes ? at first sight , loop - like xpes seem to be more frequent than collimated xpes of a factor 2.1 or 3.2 for total population and special selection , respectively .",
    "however , it can be caused by the effect of observational selection .",
    "on average , loop - like xpes are more massive than collimated ones @xcite , thus they are easier for detection above the background .",
    "indeed , the exclusion of faint events categorized as ( c ) increases relative contribution of loop - like xpes .",
    "it is interesting that in @xcite the number of loop - type xpes ( 60 ) only slightly outnumbers the sum of spray - type and jet - type events ( 51 ) .    for other relations ,",
    "the carefully selected events seem to be less affected by observational constraints than those of the entire populations .",
    "therefore we conclude that the former events adequately characterize intrinsic features of particular subclasses .",
    "for example , for loop - like xpes the relation between eruptive and confined or between recurrent and single events is distinctly different from that for collimated xpes .",
    "loop - like xpes are dominantly eruptive ( 82 to 14 ) and recurrent ( 59 to 37 ) , whereas collimated xpes are more frequently confined ( 19 to 11 ) and single ( 20 to 10 ) .",
    "we would like to stress that subclasses of xpes defined by us resemble some types of classical prominences observed in h@xmath18 line @xcite .",
    "namely , a surge is a prominence that is collimated and confined , a spray is a prominence that is collimated and eruptive , a loop - like and confined event we call as an activation of a prominence , and a loop - like and eruptive event is an eruptive prominence or disparision brisque. classifications of prominences do not distinguish the recurrence criterion , nevertheless there are known observations , in which aforementioned types of prominences were observed as single or recurrent events ( rompolt 2011 , private communication ) .",
    "this similarity between xpes and prominences suggests a close association between hot and cold components of active regions .",
    "this relation was not investigated in details so far , except for @xcite .",
    "using the classification we were able to separate several subclasses of xpes looking more homogeneous than the full population .",
    "unfortunately , we are not sure if particular subclasses of xpes refer to events that are physically different . a quantitative analysis of soft x - ray images would give closer confirmation , however for the majority of xpes in the catalogue this kind of analysis is practically unreliable , due to minor signal and other observational limits .",
    "therefore , the main motivation of this section is to justify the presence of physically different subclasses of xpes by a comparison of properties of other solar - activity phenomena associated with particular xpes .",
    "basic characteristics of flares and cmes are known well . in this section",
    "we present the association of xpes with flares , in section  [ ass - cme ] we present the association of xpes with cmes .",
    "it has been commonly agreed that an xpe is a consequence of a flare occurrence . as a matter of fact , there are 5 xpes in our catalogue , for which we could not find any associated flare . however",
    ", this sample is too small to justify the existence of flareless xpes .",
    "moreover , three of the five xpes occurred close enough to the solar limb that they might have come from flares from the backside .",
    "are they just the tip of an iceberg ?",
    "the answer may depend on extensive and careful examination of sxt images made in the quiet mode .      for better insight in time coincidence between xpes and flares",
    "we mark the time of an xpe on the _ goes _ light curve of an associated flare . in fig .",
    "[ flb - xpeb ] we present a histogram of time differences between start times of flares and xpes for 330 pairs of events . in 311 cases from 330 ( 94.2% ) ,",
    "an increase of soft x - ray emission occurred earlier than the xpe .",
    "the time difference is very often several minutes only ( see maximum and median of the histogram ) , however higher values also occur .",
    "similar conclusions can be given regarding better observed xpes of quality a and b ( compare the gray bins in fig .",

    "about 20% of investigated samples ( 41 from 198 ) any xpes were completed before the flare peak , i.e. within the rising phase of a flare . for almost 80% of events",
    "the final evolution of xpes is seen after the maximum of soft x - ray emission , very often no longer than 10 minutes ( 108 examples from 198 , 54.5% ) .",

    "we also investigated time coincidence between macroscopic x - ray plasma motions ( xpes ) and non - thermal electron signatures ( hxrs ) in detail . in this aim , we measured time differences between the xpe start and the hxt / m1 flare peak .",

    "moreover , the time of the xpe had to fall within 3-hours - interval centered around the extrapolated time of the cme front start at @xmath14 .",
    "for the extrapolation we used the time of the first appearance in the lasco / c2 field of view and the linear velocity taken from the cme catalog .",
    "the histogram of the time differences between the extrapolated cme front onset and the xpe start is presented in fig .",

    "the results summarized in tables  [ flare ] and [ cmes ] strongly suggest that total amount of energy , converted from the magnetic field in an active region during its magnetic reconfiguration , determines characteristics of events including flares , cmes , and xpes , which are thought to be consequences of this common reconfiguration .",

    "it is difficult to point out a universal mechanism responsible for all the events presented in the catalogue .",
    "there is no doubt that the majority of xpes is connected somehow with magnetic reconnection .",
    "however , in many events , the evolution is far from what may be expected from the canonical cshkp model , suggesting the existence of more complex 3d quadrupolar reconnection @xcite .",
    "we often observe an xpe as a result of magnetic reconnection that leads to chromospheric evaporation as a hydrodynamic response of intensified plasma heating or non - thermal electron beams in a flare magnetic structure .    on the other hand",
    ", the close morphological and kinematical connection of some xpes with cmes , together with the similar start time , suggests a mechanism of loss - of - equilibrium type common for cmes .",
    "[ indeed , movies illustrating evolution of some xpes resemble cartoons presenting the tether release model or the tether straining model leading to the magnetic breakout model . ] finally , some movies in the catalogue give an impression that sxr plasma leaks out from the magnetic structure probably under low-@xmath32-plasma conditions .",

    "an inappropriate choice of the mechanism can lead to meaningless and erroneous conclusions regarding processes occurring in the solar corona . in the context of strong inhomogeneity of xpes and several possible mechanisms of their origin ,",
    "it is not advised to routinely interpret all xpes in terms of a single and same mechanism .",
    "the similar conclusion were given by @xcite who criticized the tendency to employ the cshkp model for description all `` masuda - type '' flares @xcite .    if we consider a one particular xpe , it is basically difficult to decide which mechanism is responsible for its occurrence without the complete quantitative analysis including plasma diagnostics and a modeling of magnetic field structure .",
    "these conditions were unreachable in practice for the majority of events in the catalogue .",
    "therefore , in advent of new observations of xpes derived by modern instruments onboard _ hinode _ , _ solar - terrestrial relations observatory _",
    "( _ stereo _ ) , and the _ solar dynamics observatory _",
    "( _ sdo _ ) , we have been trying to give some solutions that would be correct at least in statistical sense .    we have shown that the subclasses of xpes separated on the basis of our simple observational criteria have different levels of correlation with other solar - activity phenomena . the difference is also seen if we consider basic parameters describing these flares and cmes .",
    "however , the association of xpes with different flares or cmes does not mean a specific physical mechanism as far as these flares or cmes represent physically different groups .",
    "in the meantime , discussions concerning a difference in observational characteristics to justify separate physical mechanisms responsible for flares or cmes are still open .",
    "are there two different classes of flares @xcite or all flares can be explained by only one mechanism @xcite ? are there two kinematically different classes of cmes @xcite or the division is artificial @xcite ?",
    "we have found that more energetic xpes are better correlated with flares and cmes and that more energetic xpes correlate with more energetic flares and cmes .",
    "virtually the effect of observational conditions works in the same way and we can not resolve correctly the influence of the effect on our conclusion .",
    "the most promising way in the investigation of xpes is to deal them as an element of a larger ensemble .",
    "the usage of observations made in temporal , spatial , and spectral ranges broader than those needed for direct monitoring of xpes allows the better understanding of processes in which xpes participate .",
    "recently , a similar picture of flares as global events was presented by @xcite .",
    "our experience is that xpes are strongly coupled with flare hxr quasi - periodic oscillations @xcite , probably because the reconnection rate is controlled by plasmoid generation @xcite .",
    "we also found that xpes are somehow associated with progressive spectral hardening in hxrs @xcite , thus with solar energetic particles @xcite .    in the future we are going to upgrade the xpes catalogue by adding entries devoted to associated prominences and radio bursts .",
    "moreover , the _ trace _ movies will be added , if available .",
    "we also are going to perform the comprehensive analysis of several , very interesting events from the catalogue that have been omitted by other _",
