    "<S> the @xmath0 iridate cairo@xmath1 is isostructural with the post - perovskite phase of mgsio@xmath1 , recently shown to occur under extreme pressure in the lower earth s mantle . </S>",

    "<S> configuration - interaction calculations we here provide essential information on the chemical bonding and magnetic interactions in cairo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we predict a large antiferromagnetic superexchange of 120 mev along the @xmath2 axis , the same size with the interactions in the cuprate superconductors , and ferromagnetic couplings smaller by an order of magnitude along @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> cairo@xmath1 can thus be regarded as a @xmath4 quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> while this qualitatively agrees with the stripy magnetic structure proposed by resonant x - ray diffraction , the detailed microscopic picture emerging from our study , in particular , the highly uneven admixture of @xmath5 components , provides a clear prediction for resonant inelastic x - ray scattering experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> iridium oxide compounds are at the heart of intensive experimental and theoretical investigations in solid state physics . </S>",
    "<S> the few different structural varieties displaying ir ions in octahedral coordination and tetravalent @xmath0 valence states , in particular , have recently become a fertile ground for studies of new physics driven by the interplay between strong spin - orbit interactions and electron correlations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit couplings ( soc s ) are sufficiently large to split the ir @xmath6 manifold into well separated @xmath7 and @xmath4 states . </S>",
    "<S> the former are fully occupied while the latter are only half filled . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the widths of the @xmath4 bands , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an effective ir - ir hopping integral and @xmath10 is the coordination number , are comparable to the strength of the onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath11 . for smaller coordination numbers , such as @xmath12 in the layered honeycomb systems li@xmath13iro@xmath1 and na@xmath13iro@xmath1 and @xmath14 for square - lattice sr@xmath13iro@xmath15 and ba@xmath13iro@xmath15 and the post - perovskite cairo@xmath1 , the undoped compounds are insulating at all temperatures and a @xmath4 mott - hubbard type picture seems to be appropriate @xcite . for larger coordination numbers like @xmath16 in the pyrochlore structure , the @xmath6 ir oxides are metallic at high t s and display transitions to antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulating states on cooling @xcite . here , a slater type picture in which the gap opening is intimately related to the onset of af order might be more appropriate , as proposed for example for os oxide perovskite systems with @xmath16 @xcite . nevertheless , </S>",

    "<S> such splittings may arise from distortions of the o octahedron around the ir site and also from the anisotropy of the farther surroundings . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> highly anisotropic systems such as the post - perovskite cairo@xmath1 provide an ideal playground for new insights into the interplay between soc s and lattice distortions . in the layered post - perovskite structure , iro@xmath19 octahedra in the @xmath22 layers share corners along the crystallographic @xmath2 axis , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the ir - o bonds along the corner - sharing chains are substantially shorter than for the edge - sharing links , 1.94 vs.  2.07  , which suggests a stabilization of the @xmath23-like orbital with respect to the @xmath24 and @xmath25 terms . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , small splittings between the @xmath24 and @xmath25 components may in principle arise due to the @xmath3-@xmath26 crystal anisotropy .    the precise nature of the relativistic @xmath0 ground - state wave function obviously depends on the size of the ir @xmath5 splittings . </S>",
    "<S> further , the on - site @xmath0 electron configuration and the kind of ir - o - ir path along a given direction determine the sign and magnitude of the magnetic exchange couplings . _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ calculations where all these effects and interactions are treated on equal footing are therefore highly desirable . for this , we focus on the post - perovskite phase of cairo@xmath1 , which has received significant attention from geologists in recent years because the same crystalline structure is adopted by mgsio@xmath1 in the lower earth s mantle @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the farther solid - state environment is modeled as a one - electron effective potential which in an ionic picture reproduces the madelung field in the cluster region . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations are performed with the molpro quantum chemical software @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we employed energy - consistent relativistic pseudopotentials for ir @xcite and ca @xcite and gaussian - type valence basis functions @xcite ( for details , see supplementary material @xcite ) . for the ground - state calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the orbitals within each finite cluster are variationally optimized at the mcscf level . </S>",
    "<S> all ir @xmath5 functions are included in the active orbital space . </S>",
    "<S> excitations within the ir @xmath5 shell are afterwards computed just for the central iro@xmath19 octahedron while the occupation of the nn ir valence shells is held frozen as in the mcscf ground - state configuration . </S>",
    "<S> spin - orbit interactions are further accounted for as described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent mrci treatment includes all single and double excitations from the o @xmath20 orbitals at the central octahedron and the ir @xmath33 functions . </S>",
    "<S> to partition the o @xmath20 valence orbitals into two different groups , i.e. , at sites of the central octahedron and at nn octahedra , we employ the orbital localization module available with molpro . </S>",
    "<S> crystallographic data as reported by rodi and babel @xcite is used .    </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath4 ground - state wave function therefore has dominant @xmath24 character , as much as @xmath39 by mrci calculations with soc ( mrci+soc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the four components of the @xmath7 quartet are split into groups of two by 0.60.7 ev ( lower lines of table  [ dd_cairo3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lower two @xmath7 terms have @xmath40 @xmath25 character , the highest @xmath7 components have @xmath41 @xmath23 character .    </S>",
    "<S> when soc s are not accounted for , the coupling to spin moments at nn ir sites gives rise for each particular orbital occupation to one sextet , four quartet , and five doublet states . </S>",
    "<S> all those configuration state functions enter the spin - orbit calculations . </S>",
    "<S> 32 different spin - orbit states are therefore generated for each @xmath42 configuration at the central ir site and this causes a finite energy spread in table  [ dd_cairo3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> a simpler and more transparent picture can be obtained by replacing the four ir@xmath43 @xmath29 nn s by closed - shell pt@xmath43 @xmath44 ions . in that case , the mrci excitation energies for the @xmath7 states at the central ir site are 0.67 and 1.38 ev . an instructive computational experiment which we can further make is to replace the distorted post - perovskite structure by a hypothetical cubic perovskite lattice in which the ir - o bond length is the average of the three different bond lengths in post - perovskite cairo@xmath1 , i.e. , 2.03  . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to directly extract the soc @xmath45 for the ir@xmath43 @xmath0 ion because the splitting between the spin - orbit @xmath4 doublet and the four - fold degenerate @xmath7 state is @xmath46 in cubic symmetry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the doublet - quartet splitting comes out as 0.70 ev by mrci+soc calculations for the idealized cubic perovskite structure . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a spin - orbit coupling constant @xmath47 , in agreement with values of 0.390.49 ev earlier extracted for ir@xmath43 impurities from electron spin resonance measurements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of our _ ab initio _ calculations , i.e. , the unusually large @xmath5 splittings and the highly uneven admixture of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath23 character for the spin - orbit @xmath6 states , are in sharp contrast to the interpretation of recent rxd experiments on cairo@xmath1 @xcite . in particular , the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite conclude from the rxd data that the deviations from an isotropic @xmath24-@xmath25-@xmath23 picture are marginal , as also found for instance in the layered square - lattice material sr@xmath13iro@xmath15 @xcite . while for sr@xmath13iro@xmath15 we also obtain @xcite rather small @xmath5 splittings of about 0.1 ev , comparable weights of the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath23 components in the @xmath4 ground - state wave function , and nn superexchange interactions in good agreement with resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) data , for the post - perovskite cairo@xmath1 the quantum chemical results point in a different direction . </S>",
    "<S> these conflicting findings urgently call for ir @xmath48-edge rixs measurements on cairo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the rixs experiments have recently emerged as a most reliable technique for exploring the charge , spin , and orbital degrees of freedom of correlated electrons in solids @xcite .    . </S>",

    "<S> to determine the latter , we designed 8-octahedra clusters including two active ir@xmath43 @xmath29 sites . </S>",
    "<S> the six @xmath33 nn s were modeled as closed - shell pt@xmath43 @xmath44 ions . </S>",
    "<S> all possible occupations were allowed within the set of @xmath5 orbitals at the two active ir sites in the mcscf calculations , which gives rise to nine singlet and nine triplet states with no soc . </S>",
    "<S> the mcscf wave functions were expressed in terms of orbitals optimized for an average of those singlet and triplet states . </S>",
    "<S> all eighteen singlet and triplet states entered the spin - orbit calculations , both at the mcscf and mrci levels . in mrci </S>",
    "<S> , single and double excitations from the ir @xmath5 orbitals and the @xmath20 orbitals of the bridging ligand were included . </S>",
    "<S> such a computational scheme provides @xmath49 values in very good agreement with rixs measurements in the layered iridate sr@xmath13iro@xmath15 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , with no soc s , the nn af exchange constant @xmath50 for octahedra sharing corners along the @xmath2 axis is as large as 91.2 mev by mcscf calculations and 163.4 mev by mrci , see table  [ j_cairo3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 hole orbitals are here the @xmath24 components , as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> although the iro@xmath19 octahedra are tilted somewhat due to rotations about the @xmath3 axis , see fig .  1 , this does not affect much the @xmath58-type @xmath17-@xmath18-@xmath17 overlap and superexchange @xcite interactions . </S>",
    "<S> an af @xmath49 of 163.4 mev is even larger than the values for @xmath59-type superexchange paths in two - dimensional @xmath60 @xmath61 cu oxide superconductors @xcite and points to the role of the larger spatial extent of @xmath33 functions in iridates . with soc s </S>",
    "<S> accounted for , the effective af coupling @xmath50 is reduced to 121.0 mev ( last column in table  [ j_cairo3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - orbit ground - state wave function now acquires sizable @xmath25 character and since the tilting of the iro@xmath19 octahedra does affect the out - of - plane @xmath62-@xmath63-@xmath62 superexchange path , the effective magnetic coupling between the @xmath4 sites is smaller .    for edge - sharing octahedra along the @xmath3 axis , we find a weak nn ferromagnetic ( fm ) coupling @xmath64 mev in the spin - orbit mrci calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the three components of the @xmath65 triplet state in the two - site problem display small splittings of @xmath66 mev ( see supplementary material @xcite ) , which shows that anisotropic non - heisenberg terms @xcite should also be considered when mapping the _ ab initio _ data onto an effective spin hamiltonian . in estimating the heisenberg coupling constant @xmath54 we neglected such terms and used an average of the energies of the @xmath65 triplet components , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the _ ab initio _ results , i.e. , strong af interactions along @xmath2 and weak fm couplings along @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ fig02 ] ) , are in full agreement with the observed striped af magnetic ordering and very large curie - weiss temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mrci+soc @xmath49 values thus provide a firm quantitative basis in understanding the magnetic properties of this material .    </S>",
    "<S> we have employed , in summary , a set of many - body quantum chemical calculations to unravel the @xmath33 electronic structure of the post - perovskite iridate cairo@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> while electronic structure calculations have been earlier performed within the local density approximation to density functional theory and the role of electron correlation effects has been pointed out @xcite , we here make clear quantitative predictions for the ir @xmath5 splittings , character of the entangled spin - orbit wave function , and magnitude of the nn superexchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> our results single out cairo@xmath1 as a @xmath0 system in which lattice distortions and spin - orbit couplings compete on the same energy scale to give rise to highly anisotropic electronic structure and magnetic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the present _ ab initio _ investigation yields a different picture than previously derived on the basis of resonant x - ray diffraction experiments for the relativistic ground - state wave function . the large @xmath5 splittings that we have found from the calculations give rise to dominant @xmath24 hole character and remarkably strong af interactions along the @xmath2 axis . </S>",
    "<S> further , the large af couplings along @xmath2 and weak fm exchange along @xmath3 characterize cairo@xmath1 as a @xmath4 quasi - one - dimensional antiferromagnet .    </S>",
