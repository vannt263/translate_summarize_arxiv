    "the pibeta experiment@xcite at the paul scherrer institute ( psi ) is a comprehensive set of precision measurements of the rare decays of the pion and the muon .",
    "the goals of the experiment s first phase are :    to improve the experimental precision of the pion beta decay branching ratio , @xmath4 ( also referred to as @xmath5 , or @xmath6 ) , from the present @xmath7 to @xmath8 .    to measure the branching ratio of the radiative pion decay @xmath9 ( @xmath1 , or rpd ) , enabling a precise evaluation of the pion axial - vector form factor @xmath10 , and limits on the tensor form factor @xmath11 , predicted to vanish in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "an extensive measurement of the radiative muon decay rate , @xmath12 , with broad phase space coverage , enabling a search for non-(v@xmath13a ) admixtures in the weak lagrangian .",
    "the experiment s second phase calls for a precise measurement of the @xmath14 ( known as @xmath15 ) decay rate , used for normalization in the first phase .",
    "the current 0.33% accuracy would be improved to under 0.2% , in order to provide a precise test of lepton universality , and , hence , of certain extensions to the standard model . in this report",
    "we focus mainly on parts ( i ) and ( ii ) above , and briefly discuss the first muon radiative results , ( iii ) .    the rare pion beta decay , @xmath16 ( branching ratio @xmath17 ) , is one of the most basic semileptonic electroweak processes .",
    "it is a pure vector transition between two spin - zero members of an isospin triplet , and is therefore analogous to superallowed fermi ( sf ) transitions in nuclear beta decay .",
    "the conserved vector current ( cvc ) hypothesis@xcite and quark - lepton universality relate the rate of the pure vector pion beta decay to that of muon decay via the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix element @xmath18@xcite in a theoretically exceptionally clean way.@xcite hence , pion beta decay presents an excellent means for a precise experimental determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath18,@xcite hindered only by the low branching ratio of the decay .",
    "the ckm quark mixing matrix has a special significance in modern physics as a cornerstone of a unified description of the weak interactions of mesons , baryons and nuclei . in a universe with three quark generations",
    "the @xmath19 ckm matrix must be unitary , barring certain classes of hitherto undiscovered processes not contained in the standard model .",
    "thus , an accurate experimental evaluation of the ckm matrix unitarity provides an independent check of possible deviations from the sm . as the best studied element of the ckm matrix",
    ", @xmath18 plays an important role in all tests of its unitarity .",
    "however , evaluations of @xmath18 from neutron decay have , for the most part , not been consistent with results from nuclear sf decays.@xcite clearly , a precise evaluation of @xmath18 from pion beta decay , the theoretically cleanest choice , is of interest .",
    "radiative pion decay offers unparalleled access to information on the pion s structure .",
    "given the unique role of the pion as the quasi - goldstone boson of the strong interaction , the implications are far reaching . in the standard model description@xcite of the @xmath2 decay , where @xmath20 is a real or virtual photon ( @xmath21 pair ) , the decay amplitude @xmath22 depends on the vector v and axial vector a weak hadronic currents .",
    "both currents give rise to structure - dependent terms sd@xmath23 and",
    "sd@xmath24 associated with virtual hadronic states , while the axial - vector current alone causes the inner bremsstrahlung process ib from the pion and positron . the ib contribution to the decay probability can be calculated in a straightforward manner using qed methods . the structure - dependent amplitude is parameterized by the vector form factor @xmath25 [ constrained by cvc to 0.0259(5 ) ] and the axial vector form factor @xmath10 that have to be extracted from experiments .",
    "the ratio @xmath26 in @xmath9 decay directly determines the chiral perturbation theory parameter sum @xmath27 , or , equivalently , @xmath28 , the pion polarizability.@xcite these quantities are of longstanding interest since they are among the few unambiguous predictions of chiral symmetry and qcd at low energies .",
    "the current status of these measurements is not satisfactory , as there is considerable scatter among the various experimental determinations of @xmath29 , and the accepted particle data group ( pdg ) average value has a 14% uncertainty.@xcite    moreover , the statistical accuracy of the present experimental data on the radiative pion decay@xcite can not rule out contributions from other allowed terms in the interaction lagrangian , namely the scalar s , pseudoscalar p , and tensor t admixtures.@xcite nonzero values of any of these amplitudes would imply new physics outside the standard model . in particular",
    ", reports from the istra collaboration@xcite have indicated a nonzero tensor term , @xmath30 .",
    "a careful analysis by herczeg of the existing beta decay data set could not rule out such a value of @xmath11 , which he presumed could be due to leptoquarks@xcite .",
    "in contrast , chizhov proposed a new intermediate chiral boson with an anomalous interaction with matter , in order to account for the apparent non-(v@xmath13a ) behavior in rpd.@xcite    finally , radiative muon decay ( rmd ) provides an even better testing ground for non-(v@xmath13a ) interaction terms than does rpd , thanks to the absence of internal structure in the muon .",
    "measuring photon  positron energy distributions in rmd allows an evaluation of the @xmath31 decay parameter @xmath32 that is predicted to be zero in the v@xmath13a standard model .",
    "the current limit on @xmath32 is loose , @xmath33 .",
    "it is of considerable interest to bring the uncertainties down to a level competitive with the constraints from standard muon decay .    to",
    "the pibeta apparatus is a large - acceptance non - magnetic detector optimized for detection of photons and electrons in the energy range of 5150@xmath34mev with high efficiency , energy resolution and solid angle .",
    "the main sensitive components of the apparatus , shown and labeled in fig .",
    "[ fig : det : xsect ] , are :    beam defining plastic scintillator detectors : bc , a thin forward beam counter , ac@xmath35 and ac@xmath36 , cylindrical active collimators , ad , an active degrader , at , a 9-element segmented active target that stops the @xmath37 beam ;    charged particle tracking and i d : mwpc@xmath35 and mwpc@xmath36 , cylindrical chambers , and pv , a 20-bar segmented thin plastic scintillator hodoscope ;    a 240-element segmented spherical pure - csi shower calorimeter , subtending a solid angle of @xmath38% of @xmath39 .",
    "the entire system is enclosed in a temperature - controlled pb house lined with cosmic muon veto detectors .    to collect the available @xmath40 decay events we recorded all non - prompt large - energy ( above the @xmath41 endpoint ) electromagnetic shower pairs occurring in opposite detector hemispheres ( non - prompt two - arm events ) .",
    "in addition , we recorded a large prescaled sample of non - prompt single shower ( one - arm ) events . using these minimum - bias sets , we extract @xmath6 and @xmath15 events , using the latter for normalization . in a stopped pion experiment",
    "these two channels have nearly the same detector acceptance , and have much of the systematics in common .",
    "these two event classes are part a full complement of twelve fast analog triggers comprising all relevant logic combinations of one- or two - arm , low- or high calorimeter threshold , prompt and delayed ( with respect to @xmath37 stop time ) , as well as a random and a three - arm trigger , all of which were implemented in order to obtain maximally comprehensive and unbiased data samples .",
    "details of the method are explained in detail in ref .  .",
    "the list of decays measured and/or used for normalization in our work is given in table  [ tab : decays ] .",
    "the building and testing of the detector components were completed in 1998 , followed by the assembly and commissioning of the full detector apparatus .",
    "data acquisition with the pibeta detector started in the second half of 1999 , initially at a reduced pion stopping rate , as planned .",
    "the experiment ran subsequently during 2000 and 2001 at @xmath42mhz @xmath37 stopping rate .",
    "we review below the current status of the analysis of the data acquired during this running period .      in spite of its low branching ratio ,",
    "the pion beta decay signal , marked by a nearly back - to - back energetic pair of neutral showers from the @xmath43 decay , is strong and without appreciable background .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pb : sn : tim ] which shows virtually background - free histograms of @xmath20-@xmath20 relative timing , and of the event time distribution following the pion stop time , @xmath44(deg ) .",
    "the corresponding csi calorimeter energy distributions for the @xmath6 events and for the normalizing @xmath15 events are also given in the same figure we note the excellent agreement between the measured distributions and those simulated by the monte carlo program geant3 .",
    "to to    details of the analysis method of the @xmath6 decay channel can be found in refs .   and .",
    "applying our method and using the pdg 2004 recommended value of @xmath45 ,  @xcite we extract the pion beta decay branching ratio : @xmath46                     \\times 10^{-8}\\ , ,    \\label{eq : pb_br}\\ ] ] or , in terms of the decay rate , @xmath47\\,s^{-1}\\,.\\ ] ] in both expressions the first uncertainty is statistical , the second systematic , and the third is the @xmath15 branching ratio uncertainty .",
    "our result represents a six - fold improvement in accuracy over the most precise previous measurement@xcite .",
    "furthermore , our result is in excellent agreement with predictions of the sm and cvc given the pdg recommended value range for @xmath18:@xcite @xmath48 and represents the most accurate test of cvc and cabibbo universality in a meson to date .",
    "our result confirms the validity of the radiative corrections for the process at the level of @xmath49 , since , excluding loop corrections , the sm would predict @xmath50 at 90% c.l .    using our measured branching ratio @xmath51",
    ", we can calculate a new value of @xmath18 from pion beta decay , @xmath52 , which is in excellent agreement with the pdg 2004 average , @xmath53 .",
    "we will continue to improve the overall accuracy of the @xmath54 decay branching ratio to @xmath550.5% by further refining the experiment simulation and analysis , and by adding new data .      during our 1999 - 2001 run we recorded over 40,000 @xmath1 radiative",
    "pion decays ( rpd ) events . besides its intrinsic interest",
    ", the @xmath1 process is an important physics background to other decays under study , particularly the @xmath6 decay .",
    "the pion radiative decay analysis has given us the most surprising result to date , and has commanded significant effort on our part to resolve the issue .",
    "the different event triggers used in our experiment are sensitive to three distinct regions in the @xmath1 phase space :    region a with @xmath57 and @xmath20 emitted into opposite hemispheres , each with energy exceeding that of the michel edge ( @xmath58mev ) , recorded in the main two - arm trigger ,    region b with an energetic photon ( @xmath59 ) , and @xmath60mev , recorded in the one - arm trigger , and    region c with an energetic positron ( @xmath61 ) , and @xmath62mev , also recorded in the one - arm trigger .",
    "together , the three regions overconstrain the standard model parameters describing the decay , and thus allow us to examine possible new information about the pion s hadronic structure , or non-(v@xmath13a ) interactions .",
    "the rpd data are of a similar quality to our @xmath6 event set , particularly in region a , as is readily verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : pe2g : sn : tim ] , which shows histograms of @xmath63-@xmath20 time differences and event timing with respect to the pion stop gate time , @xmath64 .",
    "the analysis of these data is involved ; more details can be found in refs .   and .",
    "to    the dependence of the region-@xmath65 experimental and theoretical branching ratio on the value of @xmath20 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : rp_br ] ( left ) , indicating two solutions .",
    "the positive @xmath20 solution is preferred by a @xmath66 ratio of @xmath67:1 once data from regions @xmath68 and @xmath69 are included in the analysis ( right panel ) .",
    "we compare the experimental and theoretical branching ratios for the three phase space regions in table  [ tab : p2eg : br ] .",
    "we note that due to the large statistical and systematic uncertainties present in all older experiments , our values are consistent with previously published measurements .",
    "the best cvc fit to our data yields @xmath70 this result represents a four - fold improvement in precision over the previous world average @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "it is consistent with chiral lagrangian calculations  @xcite , and will lead to a correspondingly improved precision in the order @xmath72 chiral constant @xmath73 @xcite .    to    thus , our experimental @xmath2 branching ratios and energy distributions in kinematic regions @xmath65 and @xmath69 are compatible with the ( @xmath74 ) interaction .",
    "the sizable 19% shortfall in the measured branching ratio in region @xmath68 dominates the high value of @xmath75 ( table  [ tab : p2eg : br ] ) , and is disconcerting . in a fit restricted to region @xmath65 data only ,",
    "we obtain @xmath76 ; this result remains unchanged if region @xmath69 data are added to the fit .",
    "significantly , all previous studies except one@xcite ( which , too , found an anomaly ) , have analyzed only data with kinematics compatible with our region @xmath65 .",
    "an illustration of the nature of the observed discrepancy is given in the region-@xmath68 plots of a conveniently defined kinematic variable @xmath77 in fig .",

    "[ b ] to    as of this writing the pibeta collaboration is pursuing a dedicated run to determine the extent and nature of the observed discrepancy more precisely .",
    "the 1999 - 2001 run produced a set of some 300,000 radiative muon decay events , increasing the world set by two orders of magnitude .",
    "due to an emphasis in the early analysis on the pion rare decay channels , the rmd analysis has not yet reached the same sub-1% level of precision .",
    "the analysis is currently at the @xmath80% level and both integrated and differential branching ratios are in good agreement with the v@xmath13a sm predictions at this level.@xcite of particular interest are the shapes of differential distributions of @xmath81 , a suitably defined kinematic variable ( analogous to @xmath77 in rpd ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rmd : delta ] .",
    "clearly , nothing like the @xmath82% discrepancy of region @xmath68 in rpd is observed here .    to",
    "this work is in progress , and the 2004 dedicated rpd run is expected to more than double the rmd event set , adding high - quality new data .",
    "interpretation of the pibeta rmd data below the 1% accuracy level will not be possible without new reliable radiative corrections for this process .",
    "over a decade after the last precision measurements of the rare pion and muon decays were completed , the pibeta experiment at psi is revisiting the field , and producing new results . unlike any experiment exploring the field before it , the pibeta project measures simultaneously practically all of the rare @xmath83 and @xmath84 decays .",
    "this gives it an unusually powerful set of built - in consistency checks .",
    "the pion beta decay precision has been improved six - fold , resulting in a first definitive test of the cvc and radiative corrections in a meson .",
    "work on this decay channel is continuing , and will reach @xmath85% accuracy in this first phase of the project .",
    "the current result , with a combined systematic and statistical uncertainty of 0.64% is in excellent agreement with the sm predictions .",
    "the pibeta radiative pion decay measurements cover a broader region of phase space than previous experiments , with more than an order of magnitude higher statistics , and have brought about a four - fold improvement in the precision of the pion axial form facto .",
    "however , the unexpected and pronounced deviation from the v@xmath13a description of the process is limiting this precision , and raising important questions .",
    "this matter is being addressed in a current dedicated run .",
    "finally , in the following , second phase of the project , the pibeta collaboration will turn its attention to the @xmath86 process which provides the best test of lepton universality and a selective check on possible new physics ."
