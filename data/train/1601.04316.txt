    "the _ virtual element method _ ( vem ) introduced in @xcite is a recent generalization of the finite element method which is characterized by the capability of dealing with very general polygonal / polyhedral meshes and the possibility to easily implement highly regular discrete spaces . indeed , by avoiding the explicit construction of the local basis functions",
    ", the vem can easily handle general polygons / polyhedrons without complex integrations on the element ( see @xcite for details on the coding aspects of the method ) .",
    "the interest in numerical methods that can make use of general polytopal meshes has recently undergone a significant growth in the mathematical and engineering literature ; among the large number of papers on this subject , we cite as a minimal sample @xcite .",
    "regarding the vem literature , we limit ourselves to the following few articles @xcite",
    ".    the numerical approximation of eigenvalue problems for partial differential equations derived from engineering applications , is object of great interest from both , the practical and theoretical points of view .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for the state of the art in this subject area .",
    "in particular , this paper focus on the so called acoustic vibration problem ; namely , to compute the vibration modes and the natural frequencies of an inviscid compressible fluid within a rigid cavity @xcite .",
    "one motivation for considering this problem is that it constitutes a stepping stone towards the more challenging goal of devising virtual element spectral approximations for coupled systems involving fluid - structure interaction , which arises in many engineering problems .",
    "the simplest formulation of this problem is obtained by using pressure variations which leads to an eigenvalue problem for the laplace operator  @xcite . however , for coupled problems , it is convenient to use a dual formulation in terms of fluid displacements ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a standard finite element approximation of this problem leads to spurious modes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such a spectral pollution can be avoided by using @xmath0-conforming elements , like raviart - thomas finite elements @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough discussion on this topic .",
    "the aim of this paper is to introduce and analyze an @xmath0 vem which applies to general polygonal ( even non - convex ) meshes for the two - dimensional acoustic vibration problem .",
    "we begin with a variational formulation of the spectral problem relying only on the fluid displacement .",
    "then , we propose a discretization based on the mixed vem introduced in @xcite for general second order elliptic problems . the well - known abstract spectral approximation theory ( see @xcite ) can not be used to deal with the analysis of our problem .",
    "indeed , the kernel of the bilinear form on the left - hand side of the variational formulation has in our case an infinite - dimensional kernel .",
    "although the standard shift strategy allows a solution operator to be defined , this is not compact and its nontrivial essential spectrum may in such cases lead to spectral pollution at the discrete level .",
    "however , by appropriately adapting the abstract spectral approximation theory for non - compact operators developed in @xcite , under rather mild assumptions on the polygonal meshes , we establish that the resulting scheme provides a correct approximation of the spectrum and prove error estimates for the eigenfunctions and a double order for the eigenvalues . as a by - product , we derive optimal approximation estimates for @xmath0 virtual elements with vanishing rotor , a result that could be useful also for other applications . these results and their corresponding proofs",
    "are collected in an appendix .",
    "the outline of this article is as follows : we introduce in section  [ sec : stat ] the variational formulation of the acoustic vibration problem , define a solution operator and establish its spectral characterization . in section  [ sec : discrete ] , we introduce the virtual element discrete formulation , describe the spectrum of a discrete solution operator and establish some auxiliary results . in section  [ sec : approximation ] , we prove that the numerical scheme provides a correct spectral approximation and establish optimal order error estimates for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions . in section  [ sec : numer ] , we report a couple of numerical tests that allow us to assess the convergence properties of the method , to confirm that it is not polluted with spurious modes and to check that the experimental rates of convergence agree with the theoretical ones . finally , we introduce in an appendix the proofs of the approximation results for the introduced virtual element interpolant .    throughout the paper , @xmath1 is a generic lipschitz bounded domain of @xmath2 . for @xmath3 , @xmath4 stands indistinctly for the norm of the hilbertian sobolev spaces @xmath5 or @xmath6 ^ 2 $ ] with the convention @xmath7 .",
    "we also define the hilbert space @xmath8 ^ 2:\\ \\div\\bv\\in\\lo\\right\\}$ ] , whose norm is given by @xmath9 .",
    "finally , we employ @xmath10 to denote a generic null vector and @xmath11 to denote generic constants independent of the discretization parameters , which may take different values at different places .",
    "we consider the free vibration problem for an acoustic fluid within a bounded rigid cavity @xmath12 with polygonal boundary @xmath13 and outward unit normal vector @xmath14 :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the fluid displacement , @xmath17 is the pressure fluctuation , @xmath18 the density , @xmath19 the acoustic speed and @xmath20 the vibration frequency .",
    "multiplying the first equation above by a test function @xmath21 integrating by parts , using the boundary condition and eliminating @xmath17 , we arrive at the following weak formulation in which , for simplicity , we have taken the physical parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 equal to one and denote @xmath22 :    [ p1 ] find @xmath23 , @xmath24 , such that @xmath25    since the bilinear form on the left - hand side is not @xmath26-elliptic , it is convenient to use a shift argument to rewrite this eigenvalue problem in the following equivalent form :    [ p2 ] find @xmath23 , @xmath24 , such that @xmath27    where the bilinear forms are defined for any @xmath28 by @xmath29    we define the solution operator associated with problem  [ p2 ] : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the solution of the corresponding source problem : @xmath32 since the bilinear form @xmath33 is @xmath26-elliptic , the problem above is well posed . as an immediate consequence , we deduce that the linear operator @xmath34 is well defined and bounded . notice that @xmath23 solves problem  [ p1 ] if and only if @xmath35 is an eigenpair of @xmath34 , i.e , if and only if @xmath36 moreover , it is easy to check that @xmath34 is self - adjoint with respect to the inner products @xmath33 and @xmath37 in @xmath38 .    in",
