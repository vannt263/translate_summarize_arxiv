    "in recent years ce based intermetallic compounds have been the topic of many studies because of their large variety of ground states , e.g. heavy  fermion behavior , non  fermi liquid behavior near a quantum critical point , intermediate valency and a metal  to  insulator transition in systems called kondo insulators .",
    "the low  temperature physics of these systems is determined by the hybridisation of the localized ce4f states with the conduction band via exchange interactions ( kondo effect ) . in heavy ",
    "fermion compounds , where the 4f ions constitute a sublattice of the crystal , this gives rise to spin fluctuations of the ce4f moments , which are completely screened below a characteristic temperature @xmath5 . above this temperature these compounds reveal curie  weiss behavior , characteristic of local  moment paramagnets .",
    "below @xmath6 they behave like non  magnetic metals with strongly enhanced effective electron masses . with increasing hybridisation ( @xmath7 ) not only the spin but also the charge of the ce  ions starts to fluctuate , this effect is known as intermediate valency .    in all these kondo  lattice compounds ,",
    "the coherence of the kondo  screening causes a pseudogap within the electronic density of states , which evokes below @xmath6 near the fermi energy @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "its width is of the order of @xmath6 .",
    "if this gap develops exactly at @xmath8 and if the density of states vanishes for zero temperature in the gap , the ground state is insulating .",
    "these so called kondo insulators are still in the focus of recent research activities .",
    "one member of this class is cenisn with @xmath9 .",
    "with decreasing temperature the electric resistance @xmath10 shows a drastic increase below 7k .",
    "this can be explained by the opening of an energy gap in the electronic density of states @xcite . as described in these papers , a serious problem of resistance measurements",
    "was the strong dependence of the results on the sample quality , especially on the concentrations of impurities in the required single crystals , and it seemed , that the purest single crystals reveal metallic behavior down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "meanwhile , pure cenisn has been established as a semi metal with a small overlap of valence and conduction bands @xcite . in this case",
    "the hybridisation matrix elements vanish at appropriate places of the brillonin zone .",
    "therefore the density of states exhibits a very small but finite value in the hybridisation gap at the fermi energy . as bulk materials",
    "always strongly depend on stoichiometry , defects , and heterogeneities , an experimental method was required that can measure the gap on a microscopic scale in polycrystalline or powdered samples . of",
    "course we are aware that ground  state properties of many heavy ",
    "fermion compounds sensitively depend on stoichiometry and sample  growth conditions .",
    "we recall the ground",
    " states of cecu@xmath11si@xmath11 @xcite and upt@xmath12 @xcite , which reveal a variety of magnetic and superconducting states in polycrystals and single crystals with marginal differences in the growth conditions .",
    "cenisn may well be a further candidate of this class .",
    "up to now nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and neutron scattering have been used successfully to investigate the gap in cenisn @xcite . here , we present the first electron ",
    "spin resonance investigations in this compound . to show that the opening of a gap is an intrinsic property of cenisn",
    ", we provide experimental evidence that the gap can systematically be suppressed ( closed or shifted away from @xmath8 ) by substituting co or pt for ni .",
    "as the ce spin relaxes too fast to yield any measurable esr signal , small amounts of gd@xmath0 were doped onto the ce place as esr probe . in normal metals",
    "the linewidth @xmath13 of the gd@xmath0 esr follows a korringa relaxation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 directly measures the electronic density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "it has been shown , that the temperature dependence of the gd linewidth obeys typical patterns in ce compounds @xcite . in heavy",
    " fermions ( e.g. cecu@xmath11si@xmath11 @xcite",
    ", ceni@xmath11ge@xmath11 @xcite ) the ce  spin fluctuations yield an additional contribution to the usual korringa relaxation . in intermediate valent compounds ( e.g. cepd@xmath12 @xcite ,",
    "ceos@xmath11 @xcite ) the korringa relaxation is strongly reduced below @xmath6 because of the reduction of the density of states near @xmath8 .",
    "it is important to note that even a partial reduction of the density of states strongly effects on the gd@xmath0relaxation , whereas the electric resistance still exhibits metallic behavior as long as @xmath16 .    in cenisn both spin fluctuations and reduced density of states influence the gd  esr .",
    "we will see that the esr results in pure cenisn closely agree with those of nmr experiments , and we present a detailed and systematic investigation of the change of the gap in the electronic density of states when doping pt or co on the ni sites .",
    "we find a transition to a purely metallic behavior in co ",
    "doped compounds and to a heavy  fermion behavior for the pt doped alloys .",
    "hence , in the present work we could support and extend the results of former investigations on cenisn by performing esr measurements at a wide temperature range from 1.6 to 120k in high quality polycrystalline samples .",
    "polycrystalline samples of @xmath17 and @xmath18 were melted together stoichiometrically from the elements with a purity better than 99.9% in an argon  arc furnace and annealed for 5 days at 1073k .",
    "x  ray diffraction confirmed the proper @xmath19structure and did not reveal any parasitic impurity phases . because of the anisotropy of the paramagnetic susceptibility , which shows a maximum in the crystallographic a ",
    "axis , it was possible to orient the samples : the polycrystals were powdered to nearly single crystalline grains by a mortar , embeded in liquefied paraffin , and oriented along the a - axis within a static magnetic field of 17 koe .",
    "the esr measurements were performed with a bruker elexsys spectrometer at x - band frequencies ( @xmath20 ghz ) . for cooling the sample , a continuous  flow helium cryostat ( esr900 , oxford instruments )",
    "was used for temperatures above 4 k and a cold  finger helium ",
    "bath cryostat for temperatures below 4 k.",

    "is used by modulating the static field , which yields the derivative of the resonance signal @xmath24 .",

    "the dispersion  to  absorption ratio @xmath34 is used as fit parameter @xmath35 .",

    "to understand the origin of the spectra and their dependencies on temperature and orientation , we have to look at the spin hamiltonian for the gd@xmath0 probe in a metallic uniaxial environment , given by @xcite : @xmath37 + j_{\\text{gd}}\\bbox{s } \\cdot \\bbox{\\sigma}. \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] the first term describes the zeeman interaction of the gd spin @xmath38 with the static magnetic field @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the bohr magneton and @xmath41 the gyromagnetic tensor , which is assumed to be isotropic , with @xmath42 ) .",

    "spins is governed by two mechanism @xcite : @xmath58 the korringa relaxation @xmath59 , which is usually observed in metals , is caused by the third term in equation ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the conduction electrons scatter at the gd  spin and transfer the energy to the lattice .",
    "this contribution is proportional to the temperature t ( dash  dotted curve in the upper frame of figure [ modell ] ) and the square of the electronic density of states at the fermi level @xmath60 : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the exchange integral averaged over the momentum transfer @xmath63 from the scattering of the conduction electrons at the gd  spin .",
    "the second term @xmath64 results from spin fluctuations of the ce4f moments according to the fluctuation  dissipation theorem .",
    "these are transferred to the gd ",
    "spin via rkky interactions : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the rkky coupling to the ce atoms at a distance @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 describes the static ce susceptibility , which in ideal heavy  fermion systems follows a curie ",

    "correlation time @xmath74 of the ce  spins is determined by the characteristic temperature according to @xmath75 . at higher temperatures",
    "@xmath76 it shows a behavior like @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "so , for @xmath78 we expect an additional , strong linear increase of the linewidth @xmath13 with the temperature ( dotted curve in the upper frame of figure [ modell ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the typical heavy  fermion pattern , for cenisn the slope of @xmath79 again decreases at lowest temperatures and approaches zero . a similar behavior was observed in the intermediate valent compounds cepd@xmath12 and ceos@xmath11 , where the korringa slope of the gd linewidth was about 10 times smaller at low temperatures than the korringa relaxation @xmath15 in the respective reference compounds ypd@xmath12 and laos@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this was explained in terms of a reduced density of states of the conduction electrons within a regime @xmath80 at the fermi energy . for a quantitative description @xmath81",
    "was calculated with an energy dependent density of states .",
    "the contribution @xmath82 vanished because of the delocalization of the f  electrons in intermediate valent systems .    in cenisn ,",
    "however , the contribution of the spin  fluctuations can not be neglected .",
    "therefore a quantitative description would be much more complicated .",
    "here we confine ourselves to a qualitative argumentation and to comparisons with results of other experimental methods .",
    "the gradual development of a pseudogap in the density of states of both the conduction electrons and the 4f  electrons below a characteristic temperature is a generic feature , which follows from the coherence of a kondo lattice @xcite .",
    "if the pseudogap develops just at the fermi level , it should reduce the relaxation rate due to @xmath81 as well as @xmath64 , which both depend on @xmath83 .",
    "therefore one expects an s  shaped temperature dependence , which is shown as solid curve in the upper frame of figure [ modell ] .",
    "the excellent agreement of @xmath84 of the measured curve of cenisn , shown in fig .",
    "[ dht ] , with the model of a kondo insulator as shown in fig .",
    "[ modell ] is clearly evident .    for further discussion and comparison with nmr , susceptibility and specific  heat experiments ,",
    "we choose the @xmath85plot , which better pronounces the effect of the pseudogap . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ dh ]  [ rkky ] ) @xmath86 corresponds to the dynamic susceptibility plus a constant effect due to the korringa slope b. the theoretical expectations are shown in the lower frame of figure [ modell ] .",
    "whereas normal metals reveal a constant behavior over the whole temperature range and heavy fermions saturate at a high value at low temperatures , kondo insulators exhibit a maximum in @xmath85 at a temperature @xmath87 , which is a rough measure for the width of the gap .",
    "before we apply this plot on our experimental linewidth data , we have to subtract the residual linewidth @xmath88 , which is always present in real samples and which is caused by impurities and grating division errors . to obtain @xmath88",
    ", one has to extrapolate the linewidth data to zero temperature .",
    "figure [ verglcns ] shows @xmath89 , which nicely resembles the expected pattern for a kondo insulator .",
    "the esr results are compared to @xmath90sn  nmr and static susceptibility @xmath91 results .",
    "the @xmath90sn  nuclear spin relaxes via fermi ",
    "contact interaction to the conduction electron system .",
    "therefore an analogous expression to equation ( [ dh ] ) holds for @xmath92 .",
    "the nmr data @xcite of @xmath93 show a similar behavior as the esr data .",
    "the orientation dependent measurements are very similar to each other , in particular the position of the maximum , which is a gauge for the gap , does not change with orientation .",
    "these data also characterize cenisn as a kondo insulator .",
    "macroscopic experimental methods like the magnetic susceptibility @xmath94 @xcite prove the microscopic data : the decrease of @xmath94 for low temperatures can be explained by a reduction of the density of states at the fermi level . as the correlation time",
    "@xmath74 changes only slightly for @xmath95 , @xmath96 behaves similar to the susceptibility . at low temperatures magnetic impurities",
    "may influence the magnetic susceptibility significantly .    to examine the influence of the substitution of ni by co or pt , we use again the @xmath89 plot ( fig .",
    "[ dhtt ] ) .",
    "first we see a constant value for the compound with 10% co , which behaves like a normal metal .",
    "the compound with a pt concentration of 18% shows a constant high value for low temperatures , typical for a heavy  fermion system .",
    "all other curves exhibit a behavior like a kondo insulator with a maximum at temperatures between 5 k and 15 k. this maximum shifts to lower temperatures for increasing pt concentrations , and to higher temperatures for co doping . as described before",
    ", the maximum characterizes the width of the gap in the density of states .",
    "however , the right extrapolation th @xmath97 is sometimes quite difficult . to avoid a dependence on @xmath97",
    ", we therefore introduced a characteristic temperature @xmath98 , which describes the temperature , at which the bending or second differential on temperature changes from positiv to negativ sign for increasing temperature .",
    "this turning point is characteristic for the size of the gap , too .    to determine the behavior of the gap with an increasing volume of the elementary lattice cell , we substitute ni by pt . we clearly see in fig .",
    "[ ueber_max ] , that this leads to a decrease of this characteristic temperature from 9 k at pure cenisn to 4 k with 9% pt . doping small amounts of co into the samples leads to an increase of the characteristic temperature , indicating an increase of the gap . on the other hand , the behavior of the linewidth gets more linearly .",
    "this points to the fact , that the density of states at fermi level is not zero , but becomes higher and higher for increasing co concentration . at",
    "about 10% co the gap is completely filled , and the sample behaves like a metal .    co substitution does not change the size of the elementary cell volume .",
    "x  ray measurements revealed , that the lattice parameters remain almost constant for doping up to 10% co on the ni sites .",
    "the most important effect of the co seems to be the reduction of the number of electrons .",
    "this leads to a destruction of the abrikosov ",
    "suhl  resonance and so of the heavy ",
    "fermion behavior .",
    "figure [ ueber_max ] also shows data of characteristic temperatures for the gap , got by measurement of specific heat @xcite .",
    "these data correspond very well to our esr data .",
    "we have shown that gd ",
    "esr nicely probes the coherence gap in kondo insulators .",
    "the s  shaped temperature dependence of the linewidth in cenisn : gd is comparable to the spin ",
    "lattice relaxation rate @xmath57 of @xmath90sn  nmr , which both measure the conduction  electron density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "the evolution of the gap by doping pt or co onto the ni site agrees with specific  heat experiments .",
    "pt doping increases the cell volume , hence decreases the hybridisation and therefore narrows the gap , whereas co changes the electron configuration , disturbs the coherence , and the gap is gradually filled and smeared out .",
