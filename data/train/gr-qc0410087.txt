    "much interest has been aroused in wormholes since the morris - thorne article @xcite .",
    "these act as tunnels from one region of spacetime to another , possibly through which observers may freely traverse .",
    "wormhole physics is a specific example of solving the einstein field equation in the reverse direction , namely , one first considers an interesting and exotic spacetime metric , then finds the matter source responsible for the respective geometry . in this manner",
    ", it was found that these traversable wormholes possess a peculiar property , namely exotic matter , involving a stress - energy tensor that violates the null energy condition @xcite .",
    "in fact , they violate all the known pointwise energy conditions and averaged energy conditions , which are fundamental to the singularity theorems and theorems of classical black hole thermodynamics . the weak energy condition ( wec )",
    "assumes that the local energy density is positive and states that @xmath0 , for all timelike vectors @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the stress energy tensor . by continuity ,",
    "the wec implies the null energy condition ( nec ) , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a null vector .",
    "violations of the pointwise energy conditions led to the averaging of the energy conditions over timelike or null geodesics @xcite .",
    "for instance , the averaged weak energy condition ( awec ) states that the integral of the energy density measured by a geodesic observer is non - negative , i.e. , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the observer s proper time .",
    "although classical forms of matter are believed to obey these energy conditions , it is a well - known fact that they are violated by certain quantum fields , amongst which we may refer to the casimir effect .",
    "pioneering work by ford in the late 1970 s on a new set of energy constraints @xcite , led to constraints on negative energy fluxes in 1991 @xcite .",
    "these eventually culminated in the form of the quantum inequality ( qi ) applied to energy densities , which was introduced by ford and roman in 1995 .",
    "the qi was proven directly from quantum field theory , in four - dimensional minkowski spacetime , for free quantized , massless scalar fields and takes the following form @xmath7 in which , @xmath1 is the tangent to a geodesic observer s wordline ; @xmath6 is the observer s proper time and @xmath8 is a sampling time .",
    "the expectation value @xmath9 is taken with respect to an arbitrary state @xmath10 .",
    "contrary to the averaged energy conditions , one does not average over the entire wordline of the observer , but weights the integral with a sampling function of characteristic width , @xmath8 .",
    "the inequality limits the magnitude of the negative energy violations and the time for which they are allowed to exist .",
    "the basic applications to curved spacetimes is that these appear flat if restricted to a sufficiently small region .",
    "the application of the qi to wormhole geometries is of particular interest .",
    "a small spacetime volume around the throat of the wormhole was considered , so that all the dimensions of this volume are much smaller than the minimum proper radius of curvature in the region .",
    "thus , the spacetime can be considered approximately flat in this region , so that the qi constraint may be applied .",
    "the results of the analysis is that either the wormhole possesses a throat size which is only slightly larger than the planck length , or there are large discrepancies in the length scales which characterize the geometry of the wormhole .",
    "the analysis imply that generically the exotic matter is confined to an extremely thin band , and/or that large red - shifts are involved , which present severe difficulties for traversability , such as large tidal forces .",
    "due to these results , ford and roman concluded that the existence of macroscopic traversable wormholes is very improbable ( see @xcite for an interesting review ) .",
    "it was also shown that , by using the qi , enormous amounts of exotic matter are needed to support the alcubierre warp drive and the superluminal krasnikov tube . however , there are a series of objections that can be applied to the qi .",
    "firstly , the qi is only of interest if one is relying on quantum field theory to provide the exotic matter to support the wormhole throat .",
    "but there are classical systems ( non - minimally coupled scalar fields ) that violate the null and the weak energy conditions , whilst presenting plausible results when applying the qi . secondly , even if one relies on quantum field theory to provide exotic matter , the qi does not rule out the existence of wormholes , although they do place serious constraints on the geometry .",
    "thirdly , it may be possible to reformulate the qi in a more transparent covariant notation , and to prove it for arbitrary background geometries .    more recently , visser _ et al _ @xcite , noting the fact that the energy conditions do not actually quantify the `` total amount '' of energy condition violating matter , developed a suitable measure for quantifying this notion by introducing a `` volume integral quantifier ''",
    ". this notion amounts to calculating the definite integrals @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the amount of violation is defined as the extent to which these integrals become negative .",
    "although the null energy and averaged null energy conditions are always violated for wormhole spacetimes , visser _ et al _ considered specific examples of spacetime geometries containing wormholes that are supported by arbitrarily small quantities of averaged null energy condition violating matter .",
    "it is also interesting to note that by using the `` volume integral quantifier '' , extremely stringent conditions were found on `` warp drive '' spacetimes , considering non - relativistic velocities of the bubble velocity  @xcite .",
    "as the violation of the energy conditions is a problematic issue , depending on one s point of view , it is interesting to note that an elegant class of wormhole solutions minimizing the usage of exotic matter was constructed by visser @xcite using the cut - and - paste technique , in which the exotic matter is concentrated at the wormhole throat . using these thin - shell wormholes ,",
    "a dynamic stability was analyzed , either by choosing specific surface equations of state @xcite , or by considering a linearized stability analysis around a static solution @xcite .",
    "one may also construct wormhole solutions by matching an interior wormhole to an exterior vacuum solution , at a junction surface .",
    "in particular , a thin shell around a traversable wormhole , with a zero surface energy density was analyzed in @xcite , and with generic surface stresses in @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis for the plane symmetric case , with a negative cosmological constant , is done in @xcite .",
    "a general class of wormhole geometries with a cosmological constant and junction conditions was analyzed by debenedictis and das  @xcite , and further explored in higher dimensions  @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple , yet interestingly enough , case is that of a construction of a dust shell around a traversable wormhole . the null energy condition violation at the throat is necessary to maintain the wormhole open , although the averaged null energy condition violating matter can be made arbitrarily small @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to further minimize the usage of exotic matter , one may impose that the surface stress energy tensor obeys the energy conditions at the junction surface . for a pressureless dust shell ,",
    "one need only find the regions in which the surface energy density is non - negative , to determine the regions in which all of the energy conditions are satisfied .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we present a specific spacetime metric of a spherically symmetric traversable wormhole , in the presence of a generic cosmological constant , analyzing the respective mathematics of embedding .",
    "we verify that the null energy and the averaged null energy conditions are violated , as was to be expected . using the `` volume integral quantifier '' and considering the specific example of the ellis `` drainhole ''",
    ", we verify that the construction of this spacetime geometry can be made with arbitrarily small quantities of averaged null energy condition violating matter . in section iii",
    ", we present the unique exterior vacuum solution . in section iv , we construct a pressureless dust shell around the interior wormhole spacetime , by matching the latter to the exterior vacuum solution .",
    "we also deduce an expression governing the behavior of the radial pressure across the junction surface . in section",
    "v , we find regions where the surface energy density is positive , thereby satisfying all of the energy conditions at the junction , in order to further minimize the usage of exotic matter . in section vi ,",
    "specific dimensions of the wormhole , namely , the throat radius and the junction interface radius , and estimates of the total traversal time and maximum velocity of an observer journeying through the wormhole , are also found by imposing the traversability conditions .",
    "finally , we conclude in section vii .",
    "consider the following static and spherically symmetric line element ( with @xmath13 ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the cosmological constant .",
    "@xmath15 is called the redshift function , for it is related to the gravitational redshift .",
    "we shall see ahead that this metric corresponds to a wormhole spacetime , so that @xmath16 can be denoted as the form function , as it determines the shape of the wormhole @xcite .",
    "the radial coordinate has a range that increases from a minimum value at @xmath19 , corresponding to the wormhole throat , to @xmath20 , where the interior spacetime will be joined to an exterior vacuum solution .",
    "consider , without a significant loss of generality , an equatorial slice , @xmath21 , of the line element ( [ metricwormhole ] ) , at a fixed moment of time and a fixed @xmath22 .",
    "the metric is thus reduced to @xmath23 , which can then be embedded in a two - dimensional euclidean space , @xmath24 .",
    "the lift function , @xmath25 , is only a function of @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "thus , identifying the radial coordinate , @xmath17 , of the embedding space with the slice considered of the wormhole geometry , we have the condition for the embedding surface , given by @xmath27 to be a solution of a wormhole , the radial coordinate has a minimum value , @xmath28 , denoted as the throat , which defined in terms of the shape function is given by @xmath29 at this value the embedded surface is vertical , i.e. , @xmath30 . as in a general wormhole solution ,",
    "the radial coordinate @xmath17 is ill - behaved near the throat , but the proper radial distance , @xmath31 , is required to be finite throughout spacetime .",
    "this implies that the condition @xmath32 is imposed .",
    "furthermore , one needs to impose that the throat flares out , which mathematically entails that the inverse of the embedding function , @xmath33 , must satisfy @xmath34 at or near the throat .",
    "this flaring - out condition is given by @xmath35 implying that at the throat , @xmath28 or @xmath36 , we have the important condition @xmath37 we will see below that this condition plays a fundamental role in the analysis of the violation of the energy conditions .",

    "( [ necthroat ] ) we have @xmath49 . matter that violates the nec is denoted as exotic matter .",

    "this condition is reflected in the embedding diagram as @xmath50 in the limit @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath52 as @xmath53 . in this case",
