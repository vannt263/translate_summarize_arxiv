    "since the early years of 20th century , there is a causal theory of quantum phenomena called _ de - broglie ",
    "bohm _ theory@xcite .",
    "it is well proved that the causal theory reproduces all the results of the orthodox quantum theory@xcite , as well as predicting some new results ( such as time of tunneling through a barrier@xcite ) which in principle lets the experiment to choose between the orthodox and the causal quantum theories .",
    "perhaps the most important point about the causal theory is that it presents a causal deterministic description of the reality .",
    "but an important by product of this theory is that enables one to put a step towards constructing a successful quantum gravity theory@xcite .",
    "the causal quantum theory is based on two postulates@xcite :    * first law : * : :    the physical reality is described by    @xmath0 where    @xmath1 is the position vector of the particle and    @xmath2 is a self  field .",
    "both have a causal    evolution .",
    "@xmath2 satisfies an appropriate wave    equation ( like the schrdinger equation for a non - relativistic    particle ) while @xmath1 satisfies newton s equation    of motion in which there is an additional force called _ quantum force _    resulted from @xmath2 .",
    "this force can be derived    from some _ quantum potential _ given by @xmath3 for a non    relativistic particle .",
    "* second law : * : :    the statistical features of the theory is such that the ensemble    density is given by @xmath4 .",
    "so the complete description of the physical reality is given by the following two equations for non  relativistic particles : @xmath5 @xmath6    the relativistic extension is easy@xcite .",
    "if one works in the flat minkowski space ",
    "time one should replace the schrdinger equation with some relativistic wave equation ( such as the klein ",
    "gordon equation for spin zero particles ) .",
    "the quantum potential would be generalized to : @xmath7 and the equation of motion is given by : @xmath8 it is important to note that @xmath9 plays the role of the ( quantum ) mass field of the particle@xcite .",
    "the extension to the curved space ",
    "time is trivial@xcite : @xmath10 @xmath11    an important result of all these things is that the quantum effects of matter are in fact geometrical in nature@xcite .",
    "one can easily transforms the above equation of motion to the ordinary geodesic equation via a conformal transformation of the form@xcite : @xmath12 so that the matter quantum effects are included in the conformal degree of freedom of the space  time metric@xcite .",
    "a corollary of this result is that one can always work in a gauge ( classic gauge ) in which no quantum effect be present or in a gauge ( quantum gauge ) in which the conformal degree of freedom of the space ",
    "time metric is identified with the quantum effects of matter@xcite .",
    "an important question is that if this quantum gravity theory leads to some new results .",
    "this theory is investigated for the bigbang and black holes in reference @xcite .",
    "but here we are interested in investigating whether this theory has anything to do with the cluster formation or clustering of the initial uniform distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "the problem of cluster formation is an important problem of cosmology and there are several ways to tackle with it@xcite .",
    "here we do nt want to discuss those theories , and our claim is not that the present work is a good one .",
    "here we only state that _ the cluster formation can also be understood in this way_. it is a further task to decide if this work is in complete agreement with experiment or not .",
    "in order to investigate if the cluster formation can be viewed as a quantum effect produced by the quantum potential , we consider the universe as a fluid .",
    "the hydrodynamics equation is given by : @xmath13 where we have introduced the quantum force in the right hand side just as it is introduced in the equation of motion of a single particle ( see equation ( [ hehe ] ) ) .",
    "it must be noted that the metric itself must be calculated from the corrected einstein s equations including the back ",
    "reaction terms@xcite .",
    "in fact one must solve the above equation and the metric equation simultaneously to obtain the metric and the density .",
    "we shall not do in this way because solving those equations ( equations of references @xcite ) is difficult .",
    "we shall do in a similar way .",
    "it is an iterative way and is based on the fundamental assumption of this theory , that is equation ( [ z ] ) . as the first order of iteration , we consider the space  time metric as given by the classical einstein s equations ( robertson  walker metric ) and solve the above equation for the density , then using the result obtained , calculate the quantum metric using equation ( [ z ] ) .",
    "then the new metric can be used to obtain the density at the second order and so on .    in the comoving frame and with the assumption that the universe is in the dust mode ( @xmath14 ) with the flat robertson  walker metric , we have from the equation ( [ a ] ) : @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes",
    "the first order of iteration and @xmath18 is the hubble s parameter .",
    "the solution of the above two equations is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 should yet be determined .",
    "the constancy of the quantum potential leads to : @xmath21 so that : @xmath22 where : @xmath23 this equation for @xmath20 can simply be solved either in the cartesian coordinates or in the spherical ones .",
    "the solution is : @xmath24 or : @xmath25 this is the first order approximation . at the second order",
    ", one must use the equation ( [ z ] ) to change the scale factor @xmath26 to @xmath27 , and then from the relation ( [ b ] ) we have : @xmath28 so that : @xmath29 and then using this form of the quantum potential in the relation ( [ c ] ) or ( [ d ] ) leads to the following approximation for the density : @xmath30 where : @xmath31 and @xmath20 is given by the relation ( [ d ] ) . this procedure can be done order by order .",
    "in the figures ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) , ( [ 10 ] ) , ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) the density at four times are shown and the clustering can be seen easily . these figures are plotted using the solution in the cartesian coordinates .",
    "it is important to note that the clustering can be seen in any of these figures . in the last figure , however , one observes that at the large scale the universe is homogeneous and isotropic , while at the small scale these symmetries are broken .    at the end , in order to see whether or results are in agreement with the observed clustering , the correlation function ( @xmath34 ) is obtained from the third order of iteration and is compared with the cases @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 and with the standard result of a typical @xmath38 code@xcite . as it can be seen in figure ( [ ccc ] )",
    "our results are in good agreement with the @xmath38 code and with observation .",
    "as we stated previously , our claim here is not that this theory is a good one for the cluster formation problem .",
    "but it is only claimed that in the framework of causal quantum theory , the quantum force _ may _ be a cause for the cluster formation .",
