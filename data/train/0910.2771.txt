    "conventional wireless mobile networks are designed with a cellular architecture , where base stations ( bss ) from different cells control communications for their associated mobile stations ( mss ) independently .",
    "the resulting inter - cell interference is treated as additive noise and minimized by applying a predesigned frequency reuse pattern such that the same frequency band is reused only by non - adjacent cells . due to the rapidly growing demand for high - rate wireless multimedia applications ,",
    "conventional cellular networks have been pushed towards their throughput limits .",
    "consequently , many beyond-3 g wireless technologies such as wimax and 3gpp umts long term evolution ( lte ) have relaxed the constraint on the frequency reuse such that the total frequency band becomes available for reuse by all cells .",
    "however , this factor - one frequency reuse pattern renders the overall network performance limited by the inter - cell interference ; consequently , more sophisticated interference management techniques with multi - cell cooperation become crucial . among others , one effective method to cope with the inter - cell interference in the cellular network is via joint signal processing across different bss . in this correspondence",
    ", we study a particular type of multi - bs cooperation for the downlink transmission , where we are interested in evaluating the benefit in terms of network throughput by cooperatively optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors for different bss each with multiple antennas .",
    "notice that the problem setup of our work is different from that for a fully cooperative multi - cell system considered in , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite , where a central processing unit is assumed with the global knowledge of all the required downlink channels and user messages to jointly design the transmitted signals for all bss .",
    "in contrast , our work focuses on the decentralized implementation of the multi - cell cooperative downlink beamforming assuming only the local message and neighboring - channel knowledge at each bs , which is more practical than implementing the full baseband - level coordination .",
    "it is worth noting that decentralized multi - cell cooperative downlink beamforming has been studied in @xcite to minimize the total power consumption of all bss to meet with mss individual signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) targets , based on the uplink - downlink beamforming duality . in this work ,",
    "we provide a different design approach for rate - optimal strategies in decentralized multi - cell cooperative beamforming .    for the purpose of exposition ,",
    "in this work we consider a simplified scenario , where each ms is equipped with a single antenna , and at any given time there is only one active ms in each cell ( over a particular frequency band ) .",
    "accordingly , we can model the multi - cell cooperative downlink transmission system as a multiple - input single - output ( miso ) gaussian interference channel ( ic ) , termed as miso - ic . from an information - theoretic viewpoint ,",
    "the capacity region of the gaussian ic , which constitutes all the simultaneously achievable rates for all users , is still unknown in general @xcite , while significant progresses have recently been made on approaching this limit @xcite .",
    "capacity - approaching techniques for the gaussian ic in general require certain signal - level encoding / decoding cooperations among the users , while a more pragmatic approach that leads to suboptimal achievable rates of the users is to allow only single - user encoding and decoding by treating the interference from other users as additive gaussian noise . in this work , we adopt the latter approach to study the design of cooperative transmit beamforming for the miso - ic . particularly , we focus on the design criterion to achieve different rate - tuples for the users on the pareto boundary of the achievable rate region for the miso - ic . due to the coupled signal structure ,",
    "the achievable rate region for the miso - ic with interference treated as noise is in general a non - convex set , which renders the joint optimization of beamforming vectors to achieve different pareto - boundary rate - tuples a challenging task .",
    "note that this problem has been studied in @xcite , where for the special two - user case , it was shown that the optimal transmit beamforming vector to achieve a pareto - boundary rate - pair for the miso - ic can be expressed as a linear combination of the zero - forcing ( zf ) and maximum - ratio transmission ( mrt ) beamformers .",
    "the rate maximization for the ic with interference treated as noise has also been studied in the literature via various `` pricing '' algorithms ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , while in general the price - based approach does not achieve the pareto - optimal rates for the miso - ic . in @xcite , the maximum sum - rate for the gaussian ic with interference treated as noise",
    "is characterized in terms of degrees of freedom ( dof ) over the interference - limited regime .    in this correspondence",

    "parametrical _ characterization of the pareto boundary for the miso - ic in terms of the interference - power levels at all receivers caused by different transmitters , also known as the _ interference temperature _ ( it ) levels in the newly emerging `` cognitive radio ( cr ) '' type of applications @xcite .",
    "we show that each pareto - boundary rate - tuple can be achieved in a decentralized manner when each of the users maximizes its own miso channel capacity subject to a certain set of it constraints at the other users receivers , which is identical to the cr miso channel transmit optimization problem studied in @xcite and thus shares the same solution structure .",

    "it is worth noting that the dimensionality reduction approach proposed in this work for characterizing the pareto boundary of the miso - ic is in spirit similar to that proposed in @xcite , where it has been shown that the transmit beamforming vectors to achieve any pareto - boundary rate - tuple of the @xmath24-user miso - ic with interference treated as noise can be expressed in the following forms : @xmath105 where @xmath106 s are complex coefficients .",

    "furthermore , it is assumed that all bss operate according to the same protocol described as follows .",
    "initially , a set of prescribed it constraints in @xmath79 are set over the whole network , and the @xmath25th bs is informed of its corresponding @xmath110 .",
    "accordingly , each bs sets its own transmit beamforming vector via solving problem ( [ eq : cr capacity ] ) and sets its transmit rate equal to the optimal objective value of problem ( [ eq : cr capacity ] ) , which is achievable for its ms since the actual it levels from the other bss must be below their prescribed constraints .",
    "then , by assuming that there is an error - free link between each pair of bss , all different pairs of bss start to communicate with each other for updating their mutual it constraints ( the details are given later in this section ) , under which each pair of bss reset their respective beamforming vectors via solving problem ( [ eq : cr capacity ] ) such that the achievable rates for their mss both get improved .",
    "notice that each pair of updating bss keeps the it constraints for the mss associated with the other bss excluding this pair fixed ; and as a result , the transmit rates for all the other mss are not affected .",

    "second , it remains yet to be proved whether the necessary conditions derived in this work for any particular set of it constraints across the bss to guarantee a pareto - optimal rate - tuple for the miso - ic are also _ sufficient _ , even for the special two - user case .",
    "this proof is essential for the proposed downlink beamforming algorithm to achieve the global convergence ( pareto - optimal rates ) .",
    "last but not least , it is pertinent to analyze the proposed decentralized algorithm that iteratively updates the mutual it constraints between different pairs of bss from a _ game - theoretical _ viewpoint .",
    "it can be verified that problem ( [ eq : cr capacity ] ) is convex , and thus it can be solved by the standard lagrange duality method @xcite .",
    "let @xmath95 , @xmath34 , and @xmath96 be the non - negative dual variables for problem ( [ eq : cr capacity ] ) associated with the @xmath25th bs s it constraint for the @xmath33th ms and its own transmit - power constraint , respectively .",
