    "vortex - antivortex pairs or _ vortex dipoles _ are ubiquitous in two - dimensional ( 2d ) bose condensates .",
    "they are the most natural excitations when a 2d fluid flows past a barrier or through a disordered medium .",
    "such creation of vortices and antivortices has been seen explicitly in recent experiments with trapped atomic condensates @xcite . in 2d , vortex dipoles can be thermally created .",
    "this is important for the thermodynamics of a 2d superfluid , _",
    "e.g. _ , for the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition recently studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "given their pervasiveness and the current experimental interest with harmonically trapped condensates , a thorough study of vortex dipoles in trapped condensates is clearly important .    in this article , we use a combination of methods to analyze vortex - antivortex states and dynamics in a circularly trapped 2d condensate , as described by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) .",
    "first , we use a variational approach to the gpe that can be solved almost analytically , providing qualitative insight .",
    "these insights are explored and complemented by explicit numerical evolutions of the time - dependent gpe , exact solutions for the non - interacting case , and a numerical procedure for accessing stationary solutions of the time - independent gpe .",
    "our results indicate that the dynamics of a vortex - antivortex pair in a trap is unexpectedly rich . in this article",
    "we focus on a subset of possible dynamics , namely , the pair trajectory for cases where the pair is initially placed symmetrically on opposite sides of the trap center .",
    "the physics behind our characteristic pair trajectories involves two effects .",
    "first , a vortex dipole in a large fluid body is a _ propagating _ object , _",
    "i.e. _ , the vortex and antivortex propel each other in a direction perpendicular to the line joining them .",
    "this has been studied in condensates @xcite and is also common experience for ordinary fluids . in a trapped non - rotating condensate",
    ", there is an additional effect .",
    "an off - center vortex is known to precess around the center of the trap @xcite ; we can regard this as inhomogeneity - driven motion . for a vortex dipole in a trap , each of the pair is driven by the inhomogeneity , in a direction opposite to the mutually - driven motion .",
    "one of the two types of motion , mutually driven or inhomogeneity - driven , can dominate , depending on the vortex - antivortex distance .",
    "this leads to the remarkable fact that a vortex dipole with the same sense ( same dipole direction ) can be propagating in one of two opposite directions , depending on the dipole separation .",
    "a similar situation holds for vortex rings in 3d trapped condensates @xcite .",
    "another result of the competition described above is that the two effects can in some cases exactly balance each other , leading to _ stationary configurations _ of vortex pairs . in this article",
    ", we will examine in detail effects of this competition , for a vortex dipole in a circularly trapped condensate .",
    "the conservative dynamics presented here should be accessible experimentally , _",
    "e.g. _ , by creating a vortex - antivortex pair by phase imprinting , analogous to the first creation of a vortex in a laser - cooled condensate @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the recent experiments @xcite deal with _ dissipative _ physics involving creation and destruction of vortex dipoles .",
    "while we have omitted dissipative considerations in this study , we will see that the conservative dynamics is extremely rich by itself .",

    "our presented results are therefore limited to wavefunctions of the form of eq .  .    using one of our variational wavefunctions , or , the euler - lagrange equations of motion , @xmath102 , become equations of motion for the defect positions @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "we can obtain these equations of motion analytically , but they are too cumbersome to reproduce here .    for a single vortex - antivortex pair with unrestricted positions ,",
    "there are four variables , leading to four coupled first - order nonlinear differential equations which can be solved numerically for the vortex trajectory . for the initial conditions we have used , we expect the motion to be symmetric around the @xmath24-axis , so that we can use @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
