    "the standard model induces strangeness changing transitions by two units through the famous box diagram connecting a @xmath10 to a @xmath11 first considered in the pioneering paper by gaillard and lee in 1974@xcite .",
    "this diagram is depicted in fig . 1 where , as one can see , all quarks @xmath12 and @xmath13 are allowed to run in the box .",
    "the result of this diagram is @xmath14 where we have defined @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for the corresponding quark masses and @xmath17 , see below . ] . in the case of the top",
    "we have defined the effective mass@xcite , @xmath18^{1.52},\\ ] ] which takes into account that the top mass is heavier than the @xmath19 . in the ( unrealistic )",
    "limit @xmath20 one would have @xmath21 .",
    "physical observables such as the @xmath3 mass difference and @xmath8 get a contribution from the real and imaginary part , respectively , of the matrix element @xmath22 .",
    "transitions in the standard model.,width=240 ]    as it is usually done , in eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) we have neglected the up quark contribution to the box diagram because it comes with a @xmath23 factor out front . therefore , one could naively conclude that the matrix element @xmath22 is given by the operator ( [ one ] ) up to very small corrections @xmath24 .",
    "however , this argument is flawed because the above box - diagram was obtained assuming that strong interactions are purely perturbative , which is obviously not true .",
    "strong interactions bind light quarks very tightly and produce a mass gap between the @xmath25 octet and and the first hadronic resonance .",
    "consequently , relative to the kaon mass , there are two kinds of contributions to the @xmath1 transition depending on the hadronic scale governing the intermediate states . on the one hand",
    ", there is the contribution in which the intermediate states are members of the goldstone octet .",
    "this contribution is given by the effect of the @xmath26 chiral lagrangian acting twice and is nonlocal at the scale of the kaon mass . in a chiral expansion ,",
    "the leading term in this contribution is of @xmath27 but vanishes due to the gell - mann - okubo mass relation .",
    "the remaining subleading term at @xmath28 , regretfully , depends on unknown low - energy coupling constants .",
    "an estimate of this term was done in ref . @xcite but the result depends on a cutoff and the uncertainties are very large .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that a reliable calculation of these @xmath29 contributions remains a very important issue . in this work , however , we shall not deal with it .    on the other hand",
    ", there is the contribution in which all the intermediate states are ( much ) heavier than the kaon . among these",
    "there are of course the @xmath30 quarks and the @xmath19 boson , but _ also _ all the hadronic resonances with @xmath31 quark content .",
    "this second type of contributions to the @xmath1 transition gives rise to a @xmath0 chiral lagrangian .",
    "the above box diagram with an up quark is a misrepresentation for the contribution coming from these resonances .    in the case of the contributions from @xmath30",
    "one can of course include gluon corrections in a perturbative way , and this has been done in refs .",
    "these perturbative corrections can be lumped into the @xmath32 and @xmath33 coefficients , with the result@xcite    @xmath34^{1.1}\\quad , \\quad \\eta_2=0.57\\pm 0.01\\quad,\\quad \\eta_3=0.47\\pm 0.05\\   { \\nonumber}\\\\ & & c(\\mu)= \\left(\\alpha_s(\\mu)\\right)^{-\\frac{9}{11n_c}}\\ \\left[1 + \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu)}{\\pi}\\left ( \\frac{1433}{1936}+ \\frac{1}{8}\\ \\kappa \\right )   \\right]\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 in the naive dimensional regularization ( resp . t hooft - veltman ) schemes .    obviously , in the case of the up quark contribution in eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) there is no point in including any perturbative gluon correction to it .",
    "furthermore , since the up quark contribution is proportional to @xmath36 , which is real , it can only contribute to the @xmath3 mass difference .",
    "then , the following natural question arises : since @xmath23 is misleading , what is the true size of this up quark contribution to the @xmath3 mass difference ? as we have argued above , there is a nonperturbative contribution which comes from integrating out hadronic resonances .",
    "therefore , in principle , there could be a contribution proportional to a typical hadronic scale @xmath37 gev , so that the corrections to the @xmath3 mass difference would become @xmath38 and could be very important .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath39 have a large imaginary part , there is an important contribution to the @xmath8 parameter in the terms proportional to @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) . could hadronic effects proportional to @xmath41 produce large corrections to , e.g. , the imaginary part of the @xmath42 term in ( [ one ] ) ?    as a matter of fact , both questions above are related because they require considering the problem of subleading corrections to the large-@xmath43 expansion .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , not much work has been devoted to the study of @xmath44 corrections .",
    "apart from the problem of @xmath1 mixing , we are only aware of refs .",
    "@xcite where these corrections have been considered . in the specific case of the @xmath1 matrix element , bijnens , gerard and klein made an estimate in ref .",
    "they restricted themselves to the contribution coming solely from goldstone loops , selecting the leading topologies in the large-@xmath9 limit , and using a sharp cutoff to regulate the ultraviolet divergences which resulted . in this way they obtained a positive correction to the quadratic charm mass contribution to the @xmath3 mass difference of the form @xmath45 , with @xmath46 gev .",
    "although there was no matching between short and long distances and , as a consequence , the physical result for the @xmath1 matrix element was cutoff dependent , there was reasonable numerical stability against variations of the cutoff in the neighborhood of this value for @xmath47 .",
    "pivovarov @xcite considered the ope and obtained matching at the level of quark diagrams ( in @xmath48 ) between the contribution to the box diagram with intermediate charm and the contribution with only up quarks .",
    "however his calculation did not show how to implement matching with mesons and , in particular , did not include the constraints coming from chiral symmetry in the low - energy region . as a consequence ,",
    "his result was very sensitive to an ad - hoc infrared cutoff .",
    "relative to the @xmath49 contribution to the box diagram , he obtained a correction in the range @xmath50 , depending on the choice for this infrared regulator .",
    "it seems to us , therefore , that understanding the size of these corrections is an interesting issue . in this work",
    "we shall reconsider the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite in a framework which incorporates the correct infrared and ultraviolet behavior and which allows matching between long and short distances .",
    "as we shall see , the crucial ingredient for obtaining this matching is the consideration of the constraints imposed by the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "let us back up a bit and describe how to organize the calculation using effective field theory .",
    "in an effective field theory calculation one integrates out all fields whose masses are larger than the kaon mass .",
    "this means that one has a theory in which the quarks @xmath30 , the gauge bosons @xmath51 and the higgs are no longer explicit degrees of freedom in the lagrangian .",
    "only the @xmath31 quarks and the gluons propagate .",
    "a set of matching conditions ensures that , even though the ultraviolet properties of the two lagrangians are very different , the physics from the effective lagrangian does not differ from the one of the original standard model .",
    "the advantage of this way of organizing the calculation is that one disentagles high- from low - energy scales , one at a time , and can treat first all the heavy particles in a perturbative way , order by order in powers of the coupling @xmath52 .",
    "this perturbative running from the @xmath19 scale down to the charm scale is very well understood and under very good theoretical control thanks , among others , to the work of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "after the integration of charm one still has a lagrangian in terms of the _ quarks _ @xmath31 , not the associated mesons , so that the calculation of matrix elements between kaon states is still a nontrivial task .",
    "however , kaons are pseudo - goldstone bosons and therefore their interactions can be organized in a chiral lagrangian in powers of derivatives and masses .",
    "this means that the quark operators obtained in the previous perturbative running can be bosonized in terms of kaon fields as explicit degrees of freedom .",
    "once this is done , the calculation of a kaon matrix element is straightforward .",
    "but in the construction of this chiral lagrangian , exactly as before , one has to make sure that a set of matching conditions are satisfied .",
    "this point has been recognized only recently@xcite .",
    "these conditions are no longer perturbative in powers of @xmath52 and require a nonperturbative treatment ; with the help of the ope , they control the interplay between long and short distances .",
    "obviously these matching conditions can not be solved exactly and one is forced to do some approximations .",
    "since , as usual , these conditions equate a green s function computed in terms of quarks to the same green s function written in terms of mesons , it is very convenient to use an approximation which can be carried out for both degrees of freedom .",
    "the approximation we will use for this matching is the large-@xmath9 expansion in qcd @xcite .",
    "the above program has been applied to other problems as well , including how to estimate low - energy coupling constants in quenched qcd@xcite .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for a list of references .",
    "in section 2 we shall review a toy version of the calculation done by gilman and wise to illustrate how the perturbative running is done , keeping only dimension - six operators .",
    "section 3 will be devoted to the inclusion in this perturbative running of dimension - eight operators , suppressed by @xmath53 relative to the former , after the integration of charm .",
    "section 4 will contain the integration of resonances with the corresponding matching to long distances .",
    "finally , our conclusions will appear in section 5 .    ) in the effective theory below @xmath54.,width=240 ]",
    "let us imagine that the top were as heavy as the w , i.e. @xmath55 . then , at the scale @xmath56 , the box diagram in fig .",
    "1 would give rise to a local effective operator given by @xmath57 what this means is that shrinking the w propagator to a local fermi interaction and leaving out the top contribution differs from the full result in fig . 1 by an amount that can be encoded in the operator ( [ four ] ) , with the value of the coefficient given by @xmath58 .",
    "this is the matching condition for the coefficient @xmath32 in the theory without top quarks and w bosons at @xmath56 .",
    "this value of @xmath59 is to be taken as the boundary condition in the differential equations controlling the running down to scales @xmath60 .    in the region",
    "@xmath61 , the running of the operator ( [ four ] ) is given by the @xmath62 poles of the diagrams in fig .  2 in dimensional regularization , where only the quarks @xmath63 and @xmath64 run around the loop .",
    "this leads to the following differential equation @xmath65 because in this calculation we are doing perturbation theory , the parameter @xmath66 is just the up quark mass and its contribution may be safely neglected . with the above boundary condition , this equation can be trivially integrated to ( setting @xmath67 ) @xmath68    at @xmath69 , one has to integrate out the charm . the diagram in fig .",
    "2 with only the c quark running in the loop requires the coefficient in the operator ( [ four ] ) in this new theory _ without _ charm to satisfy the matching condition @xmath70 , just like the condition from the integration of the top .",
    "therefore , at @xmath71 just below @xmath43 one has a theory with only the quarks @xmath31 and with the coefficient of the operator ( [ four ] ) given by @xmath72 at @xmath73 the perturbative running of @xmath32 is given by the diagram of fig .  2 with solely the up quark running in the loop .",
    "however , this contribution is proportional to @xmath66 . setting @xmath67",
    ", the operator ( [ four ] ) no longer runs .",
    "therefore , the coefficient @xmath32 `` freezes out '' at a scale @xmath71 right below the charm mass , i.e. at a scale which can still be considered perturbative , and it is given by eq .",
    "( [ seven ] ) .",
    "of course our calculation has been too simplistic in two respects .",
    "firstly , @xmath74 is larger than @xmath75 and , secondly , we neglected @xmath52 corrections in the whole discussion of running and matching . the modifications to amend this are nontrivial and",
    "were done in refs .",
    "they give rise to the coefficients @xmath76 and the effective mass @xmath77 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) ( after use of the unitarity condition @xmath78 has been made ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath52 corrections `` defrost '' the coefficient @xmath32 below @xmath43 and make it run in the region @xmath79 like in eq .",
    "( [ three ] ) , where it matches to the weak chiral lagrangian coming from long distances @xcite .",
    "however , and most importantly , all these short - distance modifications are always proportional to the quark masses @xmath74 or @xmath43 and do not change the conclusion of our simplified analysis : at this level there are no power corrections of the scale @xmath80 .",
    "for these corrections to show up , one needs to go to dimension - eight operators",
    ". this will be the subject of the next section .",
    "in this section we shall consider the @xmath0 dimension - eight operators which are generated by the successive integration of the top , the w , and finally charm .",
    "schematically , these operators are of the form @xmath81 with @xmath82 a gluon field strength @xmath83 or two covariant derivatives @xmath84 acting on the quark fields .    in principle",
    ", the proliferation of scales and operators makes this a complicated problem . to simplify matters",
    ", we shall neglect logarithmic corrections such as @xmath85 in front of larger logarithms such as @xmath86 .",
    "this means that we may integrate out simultaneously the top and the w at a common scale , @xmath87 .    at the scale @xmath88 ,",
    "@xmath0 dimension - eight operators may get generated from the difference between the diagrams in fig . 1 and their counterparts in the effective theory without the top and the w boson .",
    "the different contributions can be broken down as follows .",
    "firstly , the top contribution will give terms proportional to @xmath89 ; and the mixed diagrams involving the top and the up and charm quarks will give terms proportional to @xmath90 , because of unitarity .",
    "notice that at the matching scale @xmath88 the @xmath12 quarks are effectively massless .",
    "moreover , the diagrams with only the @xmath12 quarks in the loop will be proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , the net result at @xmath88 is that all contributions are modulated by the factor @xmath92 which is tiny and can be neglected .",
    "notice that the @xmath89 term in eq .",
    "( [ one ] ) is kept only because it is accompanied by the large @xmath93 factor .",
    "this factor now is impossible because , by dimensional analysis , there can be no @xmath74 in front of the operator ( [ op1 ] ) .",
    "however , at the scale @xmath88 there are @xmath26 dimension - six operators which come from @xmath19 exchange at @xmath94 .",
    "the flavor structure of these @xmath26 operators is given schematically by @xmath95 with any combination of color indices .",
    "one should now run down to the scale @xmath69 . in",
    "so doing , squaring one of the operators ( [ op2 ] ) will produce a @xmath0 dimension - eight operator , such as ( [ op1 ] ) .",
    "however , unlike in the dimension - six case ( [ five ] ) , there can be no mass factors in eq .",
    "( [ op1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , not only in the matching condition at @xmath88 but also in the logarithmic running , the @xmath63 and @xmath64 quarks are effectively degenerate .",
    "furthermore , in the mixing of @xmath96 into the operator ( [ op1 ] ) the @xmath97 indices in ( [ op2 ] ) have to be contracted .",
    "thus , this mixing arranges the gim cancelation in the sum @xmath98 and equals @xmath99 , again .",
    "since this is a consequence of flavor symmetry , gluons can not alter this conclusion .    at the scale @xmath69 , charm gets integrated out . at this point",
    "we bring in the large-@xmath9 approximation , which we shall use in the rest of this work . in the large-@xmath9 limit ,",
    "four - quark operators factorize and become a product of two independent color singlets .",
    "this is true even in the presence of gluon operators .",
    "furthermore , we should keep in mind that we are eventually interested in matrix elements between a @xmath10 and a @xmath11 , to lowest order in the chiral expansion , i.e. @xmath27",
    ". there are two ways in which we can get a dimension - eight operator : either as a product of two dimension - four operators , or as a product of a dimension-3 operator times a dimension-5 one .",
    "the first case yields contributions of higher chiral order , namely @xmath28 .",
    "this is because @xmath100 as can be immediately seen by contracting with @xmath101 and use of the equations of motion in the chiral limit .",
    "so , only the possibility @xmath102 is left .",
    "however , @xmath103 is the _ only _ dimension - five current connecting a kaon to the vacuum@xcite .",

    "( [ matchcond ] ) proportional to @xmath36 is , of course , purely real .",
