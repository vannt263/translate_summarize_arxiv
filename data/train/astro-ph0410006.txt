    "the dominant contributions to the integrals in equations ( [ equ:56 ] ) and ( [ equ:57 ] ) arise from modes with @xmath217 such that @xmath218 and @xmath219 , and equation ( [ equ:56 ] ) reduces to @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the rms of the ( large scale ) uniform bulk velocity @xmath222 the factor of @xmath223 in eq .",

    "for the kinetic sz effect , however , we find that the 2-halo correlation term is most important and the 1-halo term can be neglected .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : szpower ] , where we show our prediction for the cmb power spectrum associated with the kinetic sz effect and a comparison with the thermal sz contribution .",
    "it is observed that the kinetic sz contribution is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the thermal sz contribution .",
    "we also see that the thermal sz effect is dominated by individual halos , while the kinetic sz effect is dominated by large scale structure correlations depicted by the 2-halo term .",
    "we understand these results as follows : the temperature anisotropies associated with the thermal sz effect are proportional to the temperature weighted electron density ( or the electron pressure , cf . equation ( 1 ) ) and are therefore dominated by the most massive clusters with a correspondingly high electron temperature .",
    "the kinetic sz contribution is independent of the cluster temperature and depends only on the electron density and the cluster velocity .",
    "contributions to the kinetic sz effect therefore come from baryons tracing all scales down to small mass halos and the cmb power spectrum associated with the kinetic sz rescattering is dominated by the large scale correlations of the halos .",
    "the different mass dependence of the two effects suggests that wide - field thermal and kinetic sz maps will show characteristic differences in that massive halos , or clusters , will be clearly visible in a map tracing the thermal sz effect , while the large scale structure will be more evident in a kinetic sz map . as shown in the thermal and kinetic sz maps in fig .  [",
    "fig : tszksz ] from @xcite , numerical simulations are in fact consistent with this picture ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the contribution due to the line of sight motion of halos , there is an effect resulting from halo rotations as discussed by @xcite .",
    "recent studies have considered this non - uniform motion of cluster gas with numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the signal is considerably smaller than the bulk flow kinetic sz effect and therefore unlikely to be of interest to current and next - generation measurements of arcminute - scale cmb anisotropies .",
    "polarization of cmb anisotropies is generated when the cmb photons scatter off free electrons .",
    "the polarization therefore traces the ionization history of the universe .",

    "cmb polarization towards clusters is generated when the incident radiation has a non - zero temperature quadrupole moment .",
    "the two dominant origins for this quadrupole moment are : ( a ) a projection of the _ primordial _ cmb quadrupole to the cluster location , and ( b ) a local _ kinematic _ quadrupole from cluster peculiar motion . towards a sufficiently large sample of galaxy clusters , we can write the total rms degree of polarization as @xmath228 , ref .",

    "the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) contribution arises along the photon path from the time of last scattering to today , as the cmb photons pass through a time - varying potential : @xmath241 effectively , the photon receives a shift in energy because the potential it falls into is different from the potential it must climb out of .",

    "the primordial quadrupole has a coherence length comparable to the horizon .",
    "we thus expect the polarization signal measured on a @xmath249 patch of sky may differ by order unity from that on a different @xmath249 patch of sky .",
    "finally , note that thomson scattering from cold electrons will not change the photon frequency .",
    "thus , there will be no frequency dependence of the rescattering of the primordial quadrupole .",

    "this is similar to component separation suggestions in the literature as applied to temperature observations , such as the separation of the thermal sz - effect from dominant primordial fluctuations @xcite .",

    "for each cluster we also measure its redshift and the optical depth through the thermal sz effect .",
    "we do this for a large sample of clusters , bin the resulting data into redshift intervals and average over all sky . if the bin size can be chosen small enough this will allow us to reconstruct the rms temperature quadrupole as a function of redshift .",

    "the quadrupole leads to a maximum primordial polarization of @xmath271 @xmath197k .",

    "however , even if the signals were of comparable magnitude the random orientations and characteristic frequency dependence of the kinematic polarization would allow a reliable extraction of the primordial cmb - quadrupole .      in @xcite , we assessed the potential detectability of the isw signature with cluster polarization , while in @xcite , the measurement of cosmological parameters related to the dark energy using cluster polarization data from , say , the planned cmbpol mission , was discussed .",
    "the measurement of dark energy properties is aided by the fact that one probes the redshift evolution of the isw contribution through the growth rate of the gravitational potential .",
    "the latter provides the most sensitive probe of dark energy when compared to all other cosmological probes considered so far @xcite .",
    "this comes from the fact that the growth rate of the gravitational potential is directly proportional to the dark energy equation of state , while quantities such as the distance or the growth factor involve , at least , one integral of this quantity .",
    "+ establishing the isw effect and reconstructing its redshift evolution poses a significant experimental challenge .",
    "the advent of polarization sensitive bolometers , however , suggests that a reliable reconstruction of the isw signature is within reach over the next decade .",

    "in addition to statistical studies to reconstruct the primordial quadrupole from cmb polarization measurement in the direction of resolved galaxy clusters , in the limit that clusters are unresolved , power spectrum measurements would provide an approach to study the polarization signal .",

    "the dependence of our results on the inclusion of the 2-halo term is consistent with the result obtained for the temperature power spectra from the kinetic sz effect @xcite , while it is inconsistent with the thermal sz effect , where contributions are dominated by the 1-halo term over the whole range of angular scales .",
    "the latter behavior is explained by the fact that the thermal sz effect is highly dependent on the most massive halos , while the kinetic sz effect , and the secondary polarization signals calculated here , are independent of the gas temperature and thus can depend on halos with a wider mass range .    as shown in fig .",

    "if the energy scale of inflation is lowered considerably , say to @xmath321 gev , then we might guess that the secondary polarization could ultimately constitute a background .    as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl ] , however , there is a contribution to the b - mode power spectrum that arises from conversion of the primary e - modes to b - modes by gravitational lensing @xcite , and this is considerably larger than the secondary polarization from galaxy clusters .",
