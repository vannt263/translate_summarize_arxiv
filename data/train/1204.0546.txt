    "[ fig : cobweb](f )",
    ". we will focus on the first two cases here .",
    "a fixed point is a solution of @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath3 deviates slightly from @xmath13 and the sequence still converges to @xmath13 , we call it _ stable_. for a differentiable @xmath14 , a stable fixed point requires @xmath15 to reduce deviations in successive iterations @xcite .    in an @xmath0-cycle",
    ", @xmath0 is the smallest positive integer that allows @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath0th iterate of @xmath14 , e.g. , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , any @xmath19 in an @xmath0-cycle of @xmath14 must be a fixed point of @xmath17 .",
    "we can therefore classify a cycle as stable or unstable by the corresponding fixed point of @xmath17 : a stable cycle requires @xmath20 , or by the chain rule , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the @xmath0 points within the cycle , or the orbit .",
    "further , the onset and bifurcation points are defined at the loci where @xmath23 reaches @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the outcome of the iterated sequence of course depends on the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "below we will present an algorithm to identify all regions of @xmath26 that allow stable @xmath0-cycles .",
    "we will illustrate the algorithm on the logistic map @xcite , defined in eq.([eq : logmap ] ) . if @xmath26 is real , we will find windows @xmath27 , within which stable @xmath0-cycles can exist . here ,",
    "if @xmath28 , then @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are the onset ( bifurcation ) points .",
    "there are generally multiple such windows even for a single @xmath0 , but all onset points satisfy the same polynomial equation , and all bifurcation points another .",
    "our goal is thus to find the two polynomials for a given @xmath0 .    to simplify the calculation , we first change variables @xcite by @xmath31 and rewrite the map , in terms of @xmath32 , as @xmath33 we will solve the cycle boundaries as zeros of the polynomials of @xmath34 , and the corresponding polynomials for @xmath26 can be obtained by @xmath35 .",
    "we solve the problem in two steps .",
    "since the @xmath0-cycles form a subset of the fixed points of @xmath17 , we will first find the polynomials at the stability boundaries of the fixed points of @xmath17 ( sections [ sec : cyclic ] to [ sec : examples ] ) , then remove contributions from shorter @xmath36-cycles ( @xmath37 ) ( sections [ sec : primfac ] and [ sec : degprimfac ] ) .",
    "let us consider the first step of finding the fixed points of @xmath17 .",
    "at the first glance , the problem can be tackled by brute force : we can solve eqs.([eq : logmaps ] ) and express @xmath38 in terms of @xmath34 , and then plug the solution into ( [ eq : der ] ) .",
    "the result contains @xmath34 only ( no @xmath19 ) , and is therefore the answer .",
    "but since eqs.([eq : logmaps ] ) are nonlinear , it quickly becomes impossible for @xmath39 , as the degree of polynomials grows exponentially ; thus it is nontrivial to reduce the final equation of @xmath34 into a polynomial one .",
    "nonetheless , on a computer , one can construct a grbner basis @xcite to automate the reduction .",
    "the approach , albeit straightforward , does not exploit the cyclic structure of eqs.([eq : logmaps ] ) , can thus be improved by the following alternative .    instead of solving eqs.([eq :",
    "logmaps ] ) for @xmath19 , we will derive a set of _ homogeneous linear _ equations of cyclic polynomials of @xmath19 ( an example of a cyclic polynomial is @xmath40 ) .",
    "now the matrix formed by the coefficients of the homogeneous linear equations must have a zero determinant , for the cyclic polynomials are not zeros altogether .",
    "thus , the zero - determinant condition gives the needed polynomial equations of @xmath34 , whose roots contain all fixed points of @xmath17 .",
    "this completes the first step .    for the second step ,",
    "we show that short cycles serve as factors in the polynomials obtained above , and thus can be readily factored out .",
    "a polynomial is cyclic if it is invariant under the cycling of variables @xmath41 , e.g. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , for @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "a cyclic polynomial should not to be confused with a symmetric polynomial , which is invariant under the exchange of any two @xmath19 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) ; e.g. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not symmetric , but @xmath50 is .",
    "a cyclic polynomial can be generated by summing over distinct cyclic versions of a simpler polynomial of @xmath19 , or a _ generator _",
    ", e.g. , @xmath51 is a generator of @xmath48 ; @xmath52 is that of @xmath49 ; and @xmath53 is that of @xmath50 ; note that the coefficient before @xmath52 is 1 in the second case for there are only two distinct versions , but is @xmath54 in the third case for there are four .",
    "we now consider cyclic polynomials generated from a monomial of unit coefficient , such as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , but not @xmath50 .",
    "they can be systematically labeled as follows .",
    "we pick the monomial generator , which can be written as @xmath55 , then form a sequence @xmath56 of indices with @xmath57 1 s , @xmath58 2 s ,  , @xmath59 @xmath0 s ; the corresponding cyclic polynomial is denoted by @xmath60 , e.g. , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we omit the length @xmath0 in this notation , for we will mostly work with a fixed @xmath0 at a time .",
    "since a cyclic polynomial can have multiple generators , e.g. , both @xmath51 and @xmath63 are generators of @xmath64 ( assuming @xmath65 ) , we pick the one that corresponds to the smallest @xmath56 in the sense of lexicographic order , e.g. , we choose @xmath51 instead of @xmath63 for @xmath64 , because @xmath66 . finally , we add @xmath67 for completeness .",
    "we further restrict ourselves to a subset of square - free cyclic polynomials , which have no square or higher powers of any @xmath19 , e.g. , @xmath68 is square - free , @xmath69 is not , see table [ tab : sqrfreepoly ] for more examples . obviously , the label @xmath56 of a square - free polynomial has no repeated index .",

    "[ thm : sqrfree ]    we show the theorem by the following square - free reduction .",
    "given a cyclic polynomial @xmath108 , we recursively apply eq.([eq : logmaps ] ) as @xmath113 , until all squares or higher powers of @xmath19 are eliminated .",
    "the process will not last indefinitely for each substitution reduces the degree in @xmath19 ( no matter which @xmath114 ) by one . since the original polynomial is cyclic ,",
    "so is the reduced one .",
    "all terms that involve no @xmath19 are collected to serve as the coefficient before @xmath115 , which is 1 .",
    "since no square or higher powers of @xmath19 can survive the reduction , all cyclic polynomials in the final result are square - free .",
    "the coefficients are polynomials of @xmath34 , for @xmath34 is the only variable introduced by the substitutions .",
    "for example , for @xmath116 , the cyclic polynomial @xmath117 can be written as @xmath118 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "theorem [ thm : sqrfree ] shows that any cyclic polynomial can be expanded as a combination of the square - free ones , which serve as a basis . below",
    "we show that at the onset and bifurcation points , the square - free cyclic polynomials @xmath60 are themselves linearly connected by an @xmath121 matrix equation .",
    "the determinant of matrix must vanish , and this condition yields the solution of the problem .",
    "we first observe that the derivative of @xmath17 is a cyclic polynomial : @xmath122    now , for any @xmath56 , @xmath123 is also a cyclic polynomial , since the product of two cyclic polynomials is cyclic too",
    ". we can therefore expand it by theorem [ thm : sqrfree ] as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a polynomial of @xmath34 , and @xmath126 .    by eq.([eq : der ] ) , at the onset or bifurcation point , @xmath127 is equal to a number @xmath128 or @xmath25 , respectively ; so eq.([eq : xcp0 ] ) becomes a homogeneous linear equation of @xmath60 : @xmath129 or in matrix form , @xmath130 \\ , { \\mathbf{c } } = 0 , \\tag{$\\ref{eq : xcp}'$}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 is the @xmath121 identity matrix , @xmath132 is an @xmath121 matrix , and @xmath133 is an @xmath72-dimensional column vector .",
    "since a set of homogeneous linear equations has a non - trivial solution only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero , we have @xmath134 here we have defined @xmath135 as a polynomial of @xmath34 and @xmath136 , and we have also attached the subscript @xmath0 , for later use with @xmath137 , where @xmath36 are divisors of @xmath0 .",
    "eq.([eq : xr ] ) is a necessary condition since @xmath60 can not vanish altogether ; and since it involves @xmath34 only , the polynomial expansion of the determinant gives the answer to our problem .",
    "to summarize , we have    at the onset and bifurcation points , the square - free cyclic polynomials @xmath60 are linear related by eq.([eq : xcp ] ) , with @xmath136 being @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , and @xmath125 the coefficients from the square - free reduction of @xmath123 with @xmath127 specified by eq.([eq : logder ] ) .",
