    "the question of whether feynman integrals arising in perturbative scalar quantum field theory are periods of mixed tate motives can be seen ( see @xcite , @xcite ) as a question on whether certain relative cohomologies associated to algebraic varieties defined by the data of the parametric representation of the feynman integral are realizations of mixed tate motives . in this paper",
    "we investigate another possible viewpoint on the problem , which leads us to consider a different relative cohomology , defined in terms of the complement of the affine determinant hypersurface and the locus where the hypersurface intersects the image of a simplex under a linear map defined by the feynman graph .",
    "for all graphs with a given number of loops  @xmath2 , admitting a minimal embedding in an orientable surface of genus  @xmath6 , and satisfying a natural combinatorial condition , we relate the question mentioned above to a problem in the geometry of coordinate subspaces of an @xmath2-dimensional vector space , which only depends on the genus  @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely , we consider for each graph @xmath7 as above and satisfying a transparent combinatorial condition ( summarized at the beginning of   [ periodsec ] ) a normal crossing divisor @xmath8 in the affine space @xmath1 of @xmath9 matrices .",
    "we observe that , modulo the issue of divergences , the parametric feynman integral is a period of the pair @xmath10 , where @xmath0 is the determinant hypersurface .",
    "we then observe that all these normal crossing divisors @xmath8 may be immersed into a fixed normal crossing divisor @xmath11 , determined by the number of loops @xmath2 and the embedding genus @xmath6 ; therefore , the question of whether feynman integrals are periods of mixed tate motives may be decided by verifying that the motive @xmath12 whose realization is the relative cohomology of the corresponding pair , is mixed tate .",
    "in fact , we show that verifying this assertion for @xmath13 would suffices to deal with all graphs @xmath7 with @xmath14 ( and satisfying our combinatorial condition ) , simultaneously for all genera .",
    "we approach this question by an inclusion - exclusion argument , reducing it to verifying that specific loci in @xmath1 are mixed tate ( see  [ tmq ] ) .",
    "we carry out this verification for @xmath15 loops (  [ motframesec ] ) , showing that the motive @xmath16 is mixed tate . in doing so",
    ", we obtain explicit formulae for the class @xmath17 $ ] ( corresponding to the ` wheel with three spokes ' ) and for the classes of strata of the same locus , in the grothendieck group of varieties .",
    "these classes may be assembled to construct the corresponding class for any graph with three loops ( satisfying our combinatorial condition ) .",
    "this illustrates a simple case of our strategy : it follows that , modulo the issue of divergences , feynman integrals of graphs with three or fewer loops are indeed periods of mixed tate motives .",
    "carrying out the same strategy for a larger number of loops is a worthwhile project .",
    "finally , in  [ divs ] we discuss the problem of regularization of divergent feynman integrals , and how different possible regularizations can be made compatible with the approach via determinant hypersurfaces described here .",
    "we recall the basic notation and terminology we use in the following .",
    "[ feydiag ] consider a scalar field theory with lagrangian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a polynomial in @xmath20 of degree at least three .",
    "then a one particle irreducible ( 1pi ) feynman graph @xmath7 of the theory is a finite connected graph with the following properties .    *",
    "the valence of each vertex is equal to the degree of one of the monomials in the lagrangian . *",
    "the set @xmath21 of edges of the graph is divided into _ internal _ and _ external _ edges , @xmath22 .",
    "each internal edge connects two vertices of the graph , while the external edges have only one vertex .",
    "( one thinks of an internal edges as being a union of two half - edges and an external one as being a single half - edge . ) * the graph can not be disconnected by removing a single internal edge .",
    "this is the 1pi condition .    in the following",
    "we denote by @xmath23 the number of internal edges , by @xmath24 the number of external edges , and by @xmath25 the number of loops .    in their parametric form , the feynman integrals of _ massless _ perturbative scalar quantum field theories ( _ cf . _   6 - 2 - 3 of @xcite ,  18 of @xcite , and  6 of @xcite ) are integrals of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a possibly divergent @xmath7-factor , @xmath28 is the simplex @xmath29 and the polynomials @xmath30 and @xmath31 are obtained from the combinatorics of the graph , respectively as @xmath32 where the sum is over all the spanning trees @xmath33 of @xmath7 and @xmath34 where the sum is over the cut - sets @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _  the collections of @xmath36 internal edges that divide the graph @xmath7 in exactly two connected components @xmath37 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath38 is a function of the external momenta attached to the vertices in either one of the two components @xmath39 here the @xmath40 are defined as @xmath41 where the @xmath42 are incoming external momenta attached to the external edges of @xmath7 and satisfying the conservation law @xmath43 in order to work with algebraic differential forms defined over @xmath44 , we assume that the external momenta are also taking rational values @xmath45 .",
    "ignoring the @xmath7-function factor in , one is interested in understanding what kind of period is the integral @xmath46    in quantum field theory one can consider the same physical theory ( with specified lagrangian ) in different spacetime dimensions @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , one should think of the dimension @xmath48 as one of the variable parameters in the problem .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we work in the range where @xmath48 is sufficiently large , so that @xmath49 . the case @xmath50 is the _ log divergent _",
    "case , where the integral simplifies to the form @xmath51    another case where the feynman integral has the simpler form , even for graphs that do not necessarily satisfy the log divergent condition , _ i.e.",
    "_  for @xmath52 , is where one considers the case with nonzero mass @xmath53 , but with external momenta set equal to zero . in such cases ,",
    "the parametric feynman integral becomes of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is of the form @xmath56 with @xmath57    in the following we assume that we are either in the massless case and in the range of dimensions @xmath48 satisfying @xmath49 , or in the massive case with zero external momenta and arbitrary dimension .    a first issue one needs to clarify in addressing the question of feynman integrals and periods is the fact that the integral is often divergent .",
    "divergences are contributed by the intersection @xmath58 , with @xmath59 , which is often non - empty .",
    "although there are cases where a nonempty intersection @xmath58 may still give rise to an absolutely convergent integral , hence a period , these are relatively rare cases and usually some regularization and renormalization procedure is needed to eliminate the divergences over the locus where the domain of integration meets the graph hypersurface . notice that these intersections only occur on the boundary @xmath60 , since in the interior of @xmath28 the polynomial @xmath30 is strictly positive ( see ) .",
    "our results will apply directly to all cases where the integral is convergent , while we discuss in section [ divs ] the case where a regularization procedure is required to treat divergences in the feynman integrals .",
    "the main question is then , more precisely formulated , whether it is true that the numbers obtained by computing such integrals ( after removing a possibly divergent gamma factor , and after regularization and renormalization when needed ) are always periods of mixed tate motives .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the reformulation of the problem , where instead of working with the graph hypersurfaces @xmath61 defined by the vanishing of the graph polynomial @xmath62 , one works with the complement of a fixed determinant hypersurface in an affine space of matrices .",
    "this allows us to reduce the problem to one that only depends on the number of loops of the graph , at least for the class of graphs satisfying the combinatorial condition discussed in  [ detsec ]",
    "( for example , @xmath63-vertex connected planar graphs with @xmath2 loops ) .",
    "we propose specific questions in terms of @xmath2 alone , in  [ tmq ] ; these questions may be appreciated independently of our motivation , as they do not refer directly to feynman graphs .",
    "we hope that these reformulations might help to connect the problem to other interesting questions , such as the geometry of intersections of schubert cells and kazhdan  lusztig theory .",
    "with the notation as above , for a given feynman graph @xmath7 , the graph hypersurface @xmath61 is defined as the locus of zeros @xmath64 indeed , @xmath62 is homogeneous of degree @xmath2 , hence it defines a hypersurface of degree @xmath2 in the projective space @xmath65 .",
    "we will also consider the affine cone on @xmath61 , namely the affine hypersurface @xmath66    the question of whether the feynman integral is a period of a mixed tate motive can be approached ( modulo the divergence problem ) as a question on whether the relative cohomology @xmath67 is a realization of a mixed tate motive , where @xmath68 is the algebraic simplex @xmath69 _ i.e. _  the union of the coordinate hyperplanes containing the boundary of the domain of integration @xmath70 .",
    "see for instance @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although working in the projective setting is very natural ( see @xcite ) , there are several reasons why it may be preferable to consider affine hypersurfaces :    * only in the limit cases of a massless theory or of zero external momenta in the massive case does the parameteric feynman integral involve the quotient of two homogeneous polynomial ( @xcite ,  18 ) . * the deformations of the @xmath71 quantum field theory to noncommutative spacetime , which has been the focus of much recent research ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , shows that , even in the massless case the graph polynomials @xmath62 and @xmath72 are no longer homogeneous in the noncommutative setting and only in the limit commutative case they recover this property ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . * as shown in @xcite , in the affine setting the graph hypersurface complement satisfies a multiplicative property over disjoint unions of graphs that makes it possible to define algebro - geometric and motivic feynman rules .    for these various reasons",
    ", in this paper we primarily work in the affine rather than in the projective setting .    in the present paper ,",
    "we approach the problem in a different way , where instead of working with the hypersurface @xmath73 , we map the feynman integral computation and the graph hypersurface in a larger hypersurface @xmath74 inside a larger affine space , so that we will be dealing with a relative cohomology replacing where the ambient space ( the hypersurface complement ) only depends on the number of loops in the graph .",
    "we now show that all the affine varieties @xmath73 , for fixed number of loops @xmath2 , map naturally to a larger hypersurface in a larger affine space , by realizing the polynomial @xmath62 for the given graph as a pullback of a fixed polynomial @xmath75 in @xmath76-variables .",
    "recall that the determinant hypersurface @xmath77 is defined in the following way .",
    "let @xmath78 $ ] be the polynomial ring in @xmath76 variables and set @xmath79 since the determinant is a homogeneous polynomial @xmath75 , this in particular also defines a projective hypersurface in @xmath80 .",
    "we will however mostly concentrate on the affine hypersurface @xmath81 defined by the vanishing of the determinant , _",
    "i.e. _  the cone in @xmath1 of the projective hypersurface @xmath77 .",
    "suppose given any feynman graph @xmath7 with @xmath14 , and with @xmath82 .",
    "it is well known ( see _ e.g. _   18 of @xcite ) that the graph polynomial @xmath30 can be equivalently written in the form of a determinant @xmath83 of an @xmath84-matrix @xmath85 where the @xmath86-matrix @xmath87 is defined in terms of the edges @xmath88 and a choice of a basis for the first homology group , @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , by setting @xmath91 -1 & \\text{edge $ e_i\\in$ loop $ l_k$ , reverse orientation } \\\\[2 mm ] 0 & \\text{otherwise . } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] the determinant @xmath92 is independent both of the choice of orientation on the edges of the graph and of the choice of generators for @xmath93 .",

    "then by construction we have that @xmath102 , from .",
    "we formalize this as follows :    [ xgammadell ] let @xmath7 be a feynman graph with @xmath103 internal edges and @xmath2 loops .",
    "let @xmath104 denote the affine cone on the projective hypersurface @xmath105 .",
    "then @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a linear map depending on @xmath7 .    the next lemma , which follows directly from the definitions , details some of the properties of the map @xmath108 introduced above that we will be using in the following .",
    "[ mapstaui ] the matrix of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , has the following properties .    * for @xmath110 ,",
    "the corresponding entry is the sum of @xmath111 , where the @xmath112 correspond to the edges common to the @xmath113-th and @xmath114-th loop , and the sign is @xmath115 if the orientations of the edges both agree or both disagree with the loop orientations , and @xmath116 otherwise . * for @xmath117 , the entry is the sum of the variables @xmath112 corresponding to the edges in the @xmath113-th loop ( all taken with sign  @xmath118 ) .    now consider a specific edge @xmath119 , and let @xmath120 be the corresponding variable .",
    "then    * the variable @xmath120 appears in @xmath121 if and only if @xmath119 is part of at least one loop . * if @xmath119 belongs to a single loop @xmath122 , then @xmath120 only appears in the diagonal entry @xmath123 , added to the variables corresponding to the other edges forming the loop @xmath122 . *",

    "[ tmq ] has an affirmative answer , then this intersection admits a stratification by mixed tate nonsingular loci .",
    "it seems likely that a suitable sequence of blow - ups would then have the effect of regularizing the integral , while at the same time maintaining the motivic nature of the relevant loci unaltered .",
    "we intend to return to a more detailed analysis of this approach in future work .",
    "belkale and brosnan showed in @xcite that dimensionally regularized feynman integrals can be written in the form of a local igusa l - function , where the coefficients of the laurent series expansion are periods , provided the integrals describing them are convergent .",

    "would still be controlled by the same motivic loci that are involved in the original parametric feynman integral before dimensional regularization .",
    "the result of @xcite is formulated only for the case of log - divergent integrals where only the graph polynomial @xmath30 is present in the feynman parametric form and not the polynomial @xmath31 .",
    "the result was extended to the more general non - log - divergent case by bogner and weinzierl in @xcite .    in this approach ,",
    "if there are singularities in the integrals that compute the coeffients of the laurent series expansion of the local igusa l - function giving the dimensionally regularized feynman integral , these can be treated by an algorithmic procedure developed by bogner and weinzierl in @xcite ( see also the short survey @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm is designed to split the divergent integral into sectors where a change of variable that introduces a blowup at the origin isolates the divergence as a pole in a parameter @xmath613 .",
    "one can then do a subtraction of this polar part in the laurent series expansion in the variable @xmath614 and eliminate the divergence .",
    "the iteration part of the algorithm is based on hironaka s polyhedral game and it is shown in @xcite that the resulting algorithm terminates in finite time .    if one uses this approach in our context one will have to show that the changes of variables introduced in the process of evaluating the integrals in sectors do not alter the motivic nature of the loci involved .",
    "an alternative to the use of blowups is the use of deformations .",
    "we discuss here the simplest possible procedure one can think of that uses deformations of the graph hypersurface ( or of the determinant hypersurface ) .",
    "it is not the most satisfactory deformation method , because it does not lead immediately to a ",
    "minimal subtraction \" procedure , but it suffices here to illustrate the idea .    consider the original parametric feynman integral of the form @xmath615 with exponents @xmath522 and @xmath616 as in , @xmath617 again , for our purposes , we can assume to work in the  stable range \" where @xmath48 is sufficiently large so that both @xmath522 and @xmath616 are positive .",
    "the case of small @xmath48 , which is of direct physics interest , leads one to the different problem of considering the hypersurfaces defined by @xmath31 , as a function of the external momenta @xmath547 and the singularities produced by the intersections of these with the domain of integration .",
    "this type of analysis can be found in the physics literature , for instance in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite ,  18",
    ".    assuming to work in the range where @xmath522 and @xmath616 are positive , one can choose to regularize the integral by introducing a deformation parameter @xmath618 and replaing with the deformed @xmath619 this has the effect of replacing , as locus of the singularities of the integrand , the graph hypersurface @xmath620 , with the level set @xmath621 of the map @xmath622 .",
    "for a choice of @xmath614 in the cut plane @xmath623 , the hypersurface @xmath624 does not intersect the domain of integration @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath625 one has @xmath626 .",
    "this choice has therefore the effect of desingularizing the integral .",
    "the resulting function of @xmath614 extends holomorphically to a function on @xmath627 , where @xmath628 is the bounded interval of values of @xmath62 on @xmath28 .    when we transform the parametric integral using the map @xmath238 into an integral of a form defined on the complement of the determinant hypersurface @xmath74 in @xmath1 on a domain of integration @xmath629 with boundary on the divisor @xmath630 , we can similarly separate the divisor from the hypersurface by the same deformation , where instead of the locus @xmath631 one considers the level set @xmath632 , so that @xmath633 does not intersect @xmath629 . the nature of the period described by the deformed integral is then controlled by the motive @xmath634 for @xmath635 and @xmath636 .",
    "the question becomes then whether the motivic nature of @xmath384 with @xmath637 and @xmath638 and @xmath634 is the same .",
    "this in general is not the case , as one can easily construct examples of fibrations where the generic fiber is not a mixed tate motive while the special one is .",
    "however , in this setting one is dealing with a very special case , where the deformed variety @xmath633 is given by matrices of fixed determinant . up to a rescaling",
    ", one can check that the fiber @xmath639 is indeed a mixed tate motive , from the general results of biglari @xcite , @xcite on reductive groups .",
    "thus , over a set of algebraic values of @xmath614 one does not leave the world of mixed tate motives .",
    "this will give a statement on the nature of the regularized feynman integrals as a period of a mixed tate motive @xmath634 and reduces then the problem to that of removing the divergence as @xmath640 , in such a way that what remains is a convergent integral whose nature as a period is controlled by the original motive @xmath384 .",
