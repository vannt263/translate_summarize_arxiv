    "the spitzer space telescope ( werner et al . 2004 ) , formerly sirtf the * s*pace * i*nfra*r*ed * t*elescope * f*acility , is an 85 cm cryogenic space observatory in earth  trailing orbit .",
    "the observatory was launched in august of 2003 and has an estimated mission lifetime of 5@xmath1 years .",
    "there are three science instruments on  board : irac ( fazio et al . 2004 ) , irs ( houck et al . 2004 ) , and mips ( rieke et al . 2004 ) which together provide the capability for imaging and spectroscopy from 3.6160 @xmath2 m .",
    "the legacy science program was established before launch with two goals : to enable large scale programs of broad scientific and public interest , and to provide access to uniform and coherent datasets as rapidly as possible in support of general observer ( go ) proposals , given the limited lifetime of the mission .",
    "the formation and evolution of planetary systems ( feps ) spitzer legacy science program is one of six such original programs ( for descriptions of the others see evans et al .",
    "2003 ; benjamin et al . 2003",
    "; kennicutt et al . 2003 ; londsdale et al . 2003",
    "; dickenson et al . 2003 ) and uses 350 hours of spitzer observing time .",
    "feps builds upon the rich heritage of spitzer s ancestors in space : the international all - sky mid - infrared survey telescope iras ( the infrared astronomical satellite , 19831985 ) and esa s pointed mission iso ( the infrared space observatory , 19951999 ) , and complements guaranteed time observer ( gto ) and go programs also being pursued with spitzer .    in a single sentence , feps is a comprehensive study of the evolution of gas and dust in the circumstellar environment .",
    "the scientific motivation for feps lies in the fragmented but compelling evidence for dusty circumstellar material surrounding stars spanning a wide range of ages , from young pre - main sequence stars to those as old as , and even older than , the sun .    at young ages , incontrovertible evidence assembled over the past three decades ( based on data from ultraviolet through millimeter wavelengths )",
    ", suggests that most stars are surrounded at birth by accretion disks that are remnants of the star formation process itself ( e.g. beckwith and sargent , 1996 ) .",
    "the revelations provided by iras , and later iso , led to a nearly complete census of optically  thick disks within 100 - 200 pc , and in the case of iso revealed their rich dust mineralogy and gas content ( see lorenzetti 2005 and molster & kemper 2005 for reviews ) . that at least some of these disks build planets has become clear from radial velocity and photometric studies revealing m  sin@xmath3=0.02 - 15 m@xmath4 planets orbiting well over one hundred nearby stars ( e.g. marcy et al . 2005 ) . at older ages",
    ", iras and iso revealed the presence around dozens of main sequence stars of micron - sized grains .",
    "these dusty  debris \" disks are produced in collisions between asteroid - like bodies with orbits that are dynamically stirred by planets ( e.g. lagrange et al . 2000 ) .",
    "subsequently , several of these disks were spatially resolved at optical , infrared , and millimeter wavelengths ( e.g. kalas , liu , & mathews 2004 ; weinberger et al .",
    "1999 ; greaves et al .",
    "1998 ) revealing structure consistent with the planetary perturber interpretation .    the connections between planets , debris disks , and the dusty and gaseous disks near - ubiquitously found in association with recently formed young stars are tantalizing , but not yet unequivocally established .",
    "understanding the evolution of young circumstellar dust and gas disks as they transition through the planet ",
    "building phase requires the hundred - fold enhancement in sensitivity and increased photometric accuracy offered by spitzer at mid- and far - infrared wavlengths . for main sequence stars , while iras discovered the prototypical debris disks ( see backman & paresce 1993 for a review ) and iso made additional surveys ( see de muizon 2005 for a review ) , neither iras nor iso was sensitive enough to detect dust in solar systems older than a few hundred myr for any but the nearest tens of stars .",
    "spitzer , by contrast can detect orders of magnitude smaller dust masses : for a solar - type star at 30 pc , down to @xmath5 kg or @xmath6 m@xmath7 in micron to sub - millimeter size grains at 50 k , only an order of magnitude above the dust mass inferred for our own present - day kuiper belt , and @xmath8 kg or @xmath9 m@xmath7 at 150 k , only an order of magnitude above the dust mass in our present - day asteroid belt plus zodiacal cloud .    the feps program is designed to study circumstellar dust properties around a representative sample of solar - type stars . included",
    "are 328 stars chosen to probe the suspected direct link between disks commonly found around pre  main sequence stars @xmath10 3.0 myr old and our 4.56 gyr old sun and solar system . specifically , we trace the evolution of circumstellar material at ages 3 - 10 myr when stellar accretion from the disk terminates , to 10 - 100 myr when planets achieve their final masses via coalescence of solids and accretion of remnant molecular gas , to 100 - 1000 myr when the final architecture of solar systems takes form and frequent collisions between remnant planetesimals produce copious quantities of dust , and finally , to 1 - 3 gyr mature systems in which planet - driven activity of planetesimals continues to generate detectable dust .",
    "our sample is distributed uniformly in log - age from 3 myr to 3 gyr .",
    "we probe the full range of dust disk optical  depths diagnostic of the major phases of planet system formation and evolution , including primordial disks ( those dominated by ism grains in the process of agglomerating into planetesimals ) and debris disks ( those dominated by collisionally generated dust ) like our own .",
    "our strategy is to obtain for all 328 stars in our sample carefully calibrated spectral energy distributions ( seds ) using all three spitzer intstruments .",
    "a high - resolution spectroscopic survey limited to the younger targets establishes the gas content .",
    "in addition to insight into problems of fundamental scientific and philosophical interest , the feps legacy science program provides a rich database for follow - up observations with spitzer , with existing and future ground - based facilities , as well as sim and jwst , and eventually tpf .",
    "feps complements and motivates many existing spitzer gto and go programs .",
    "we take advantage of spitzer s unprecedented mid - infrared sensitivity and hence its unique ability to detect the photospheres of solar - type stars out to distances of several tens of pc .",
    "spitzer observations of excesses above those photospheres are indicative of dust located at a range of orbital separations , from analogs of the terrestrial zone , to the gas - giant zone , to the kuiper belt zone in our own solar system .",
    "such observations are important in the search for exo - solar planetary systems  either those in formation from primordial dust and gas disks , or those which later perturb planetesimals into crossing orbits that collisionally cascade to produce dusty debris disks . for a given system ,",
    "the mass in small grains to which spitzer is sensitive is first expected to decrease with time as planet formation begins , then increase on a relatively rapid time scale ( few myr ) as the debris phase begins , and finally decrease on a much longer time scale ( many gyr ) as the disk slowly grinds itself down and grains are removed via radiative and mechanical effects .    with the goal of understanding",
    "how common or rare the evolutionary path taken by our solar system might have been , we have initiated a spitzer survey of f ",
    "g  k ( solar - type ) stars .",
    "first , we study the formation of planetary embryos in a survey of post  accretion circumstellar dust disks .",
    "we aim to understand the evolution of disk properties ( mass and radial structure ) and dust properties ( size and composition ) during the main phase of planet  building and early solar system evolution from 3100 myr .",
    "second , we study the growth of gas giants in a sensitive search for warm molecular gas at the level of @xmath112 @xmath12 10@xmath13 m@xmath14 $ ] at 70200 k , in a sub  sample of the targets from our dust disk survey .",
    "our goal is to constrain directly the time available for embryonic planets to accrete gas envelopes .",
    "third , we investigate mature solar system evolution by tracing 100 myr to 3 gyr old dust disks generated through collisions of planetesimals . through our analysis",
    "we hope to infer the locations and masses of giant planets @xmath15 m@xmath16 1 m@xmath17 through their action on the remnant disk .",
    "our large sample enables us to measure the _ mean properties _ of evolving dust disks and discover the _ dispersion _ in evolutionary time scales .",
    "further , we can search for relations between inferred dust evolutionary path and stellar properties such as metallicity and multiplicity . in the following subsections we detail our science strategy .",
    "our experiment begins as the disks are making the transition from optically thick to thin , the point at which all of the disk s mass first becomes detectable through observation .",
    "the feps goals are to :    = -0.05truein    @xmath18 constrain the initial structure and composition of post - accretion , optically thin disks ;    @xmath18 trace the evolution of disk structure , composition , and mass over time ;    @xmath18 characterize the time scales over which primordial disks dissipate and debris disks arise ;    @xmath18 measure changes in the dust particle size distribution due to coagulation of interstellar grains at early stages and shattering associated with high - speed planetesimal collisions at later early - debris stages ;    @xmath18 infer the presence of newly formed planets at orbital radii of 0.3 - 30 au .",
    "photometric observations from 3.6 - 160@xmath2 m with spitzer probe temperatures ( radii ) encompassing the entire system of planets in our solar system . in figure 1",
    "we show the mass sensitivity of spitzer as a function of wavelength , indicating the mass in small grains that spitzer can detect as a function of orbital radius .",
    "detailed spectrophotometry in the range 5.340 @xmath2 m permits a search for gaps in disks caused by the dynamical interaction of young gas giant planets and the particulate disk from 0.210 au .",
    "this extends from just outside the innermost radii of the exo - solar `` hot jupiters '' ( thought to have suffered significant orbital migration in a viscous accretion disk ) to the gas giants of our solar system ( thought to have formed beyond the `` ice line '' ) .",
    "mid  infrared spectroscopic observations are sensitive to dust properties including size distribution and composition .",
    "they thus probe physical conditions in the disk .",
    "from observations in the 5.340 @xmath2 m spectral region we determine the relative importance of broad features attributed to amorphous silicates ( ubiquitous in the ism ) compared to numerous narrow features due to crystalline dust ( observed only in circumstellar environments ) . in this way",
    ", we can look for evidence of , e.g. radial mixing in the disk since the temperature required to anneal grains ( @xmath11 1000k ) is substantial higher than that inferred for the continuum emitting material ( @xmath0 300k ) .",
    "further , the shape and strength of specific mid - infrared spectroscopic features provide constraints on the fractional contribution of each grain population to the total opacity , necessary for estimating dust mass surface densities ( see section 4.2 ) .      next , we have undertaken the most sensitive survey to date of atomic and molecular gas in post  accretion disk systems . in order to characterize gas dissipation and to place limits on the time available for giant planet formation we obtain high spectral resolution ( r=600 ) data from 1037 @xmath2 m with the irs of 35 stars selected from our dust disk survey sample .",
    "the data include the s(0 ) 28.2 @xmath2 m , s(1 ) 17.0 @xmath2 m , and s(2 ) 12.3 @xmath2 m h@xmath19 lines as well as strong atomic lines such as [ si ] 25.23 @xmath2 m , [ si ii ] 34.8 @xmath2 m , and [ feii ] 26 @xmath2 m ( gorti & hollenbach 2004 ; hollenbach et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we focus on the post - accretion epochs from 3100 myr to examine whether gas disks persist after disk accretion onto the star has ceased and planetesimal agglomeration has removed the dust disk , potentially providing `` nucleation sites '' for gas giant planet formation .    understanding gas ",
    "dust dynamics is crucial to our ability to derive the time scales important in planet formation and evolution .",
    "the dust and gas experiments being conducted at young ages ( @xmath10100 myr ) have an important synergy in furthering this understanding because dust dynamics are controlled by gas drag rather than radiation pressure when the gas - to - dust mass ratio is @xmath110.1 , while it is the presence of dust that mediates gas heating and therefore detectability .",
    "if the gas to dust ratio is low ( the dust opacity per gas particle high ) and the gas and dust are at similar temperatures , the detection of gas lines by spitzer becomes difficult due to the small ratio of line to continuum .",
    "however , the theoretical models of gorti & hollenbach ( 2004 ) show that in many instances the dust opacity is sufficiently low and the gas temperature sufficiently high ( @xmath20 k ) that small quantities ( @xmath21 m@xmath4 ) of gas , if present , can be detected by spitzer around nearby disks with optically thin dust ( see section 4.4 ) .",
    "finally , we conduct a study of second generation `` debris disks '' .",
    "the presence of _ any _ observable circumstellar dust around stars older than the maximum lifetime of a primordial dust disk ( the sum of the to  be  determined gas dissipation time scale and the characteristic poynting ",
    "robertson drag time scale ) provides compelling evidence not only for large reservoirs of planetesimals colliding to produce the dust , but also for the existence of massive planetary bodies that dynamically perturb planetesimal orbits inducing frequent collisions .",
    "we have undertaken the first comprehensive survey of f5k5 stars with ages 100 myr to 3 gyr that is sensitive to dust disks comparable to those characteristic of our own solar system throughout its evolution .",
    "we chart the history of our solar system from 100300 myr , the last phase of terrestrial and ice giant ( ( uranus- and neptune - like ) planet  building , through 0.31 gyr , bracketing the `` late heavy bombardment '' impact peak which might have had an effect on the early evolution of life on earth , and finally over 1.03.0 gyr , examining the diversity of evolutionary paths among mature planetary system .",
    "spectroscopic observations in the range 5.340 @xmath2 m enable diagnosis of gaps caused by giant planets and estimates of dust size and composition which translate directly into constraints on the mass opacity coeffients for the dust ( miyake & nakagawa , 1993 ) as well as poynting - robertson drag time scales ( backman e & parsece , 1993 ) .",
    "a complete and uniform set of spitzer photometric and spectroscopic observations are obtained for all stars in our dust disk evolution sample , as described below . to derive statistically meaningful results on the disk and dust properties , we observe @xmath050 stars in each of 6 logarithmically spaced age bins from 3 myr ( connecting our legacy program to that of evans et al . ) to 3 gyr ( beyond which there is strong emphasis by gtos on debris disk science ; beichman et al . 2005 ) .",
    "our targets span a narrow mass range ( 0.7 - 2.2  m@xmath22 ) and are proximate enough to enable a complete census for circumstellar dust comparable to our model solar system as a function of age .",
    "we measure the stellar photosphere at snr@xmath1130 for @xmath23 3.624 @xmath2 m , snr @xmath11 5 at 70 @xmath2 m ( or snr @xmath11 5 for 5 @xmath12 the current zodiacal dust emission ) with broadband photometry from irac and mips ( subject to calibration uncertainties ) . to identify gaps in the dust distribution created by the presence of giant planets from 0.210 au , we require relative spectrophotometry with snr@xmath1130 from 5.311 @xmath2 m , and with snr @xmath0 612 at wavelengths between 2030 @xmath2 m with the irs .",
    "a sub - sample of 35 stars comprises our gas disk evolution study with the high resolution mode of the irs .",
    "this sample spans a range of spectral type ( f3k5 ) , age ( 3100 myr ) , activity ( l@xmath24 ) , and a wide range of infrared excess emission , with some preference for optically ",
    "thin excess in the mid  infrared .",
    "fourteen stars were chosen for first - look observations and enable us to explore the limits implied by null results and guide our choice of follow  up observations for additional stars drawn from our dust disk survey .",
    "our goal is to collect data capable of realizing the fundamental limits imposed by instrument stability and systematic calibration uncertainties .",
    "integration times are chosen according to each star s distance , age and spectral type to reach uniform snr at the photospheric limits , as specified above  thereby providing a _",
    "complete census _ of dust disks for our targets .",
    "the source list for feps consists of young near - solar analogs , stars ranging in mass from 0.7 - 2.2 m@xmath22 though strongly peaked at 1 m@xmath25 ( see figure 2 ) , and spanning ages 3 myr to 3 gyr ( our sun is 4.56 gyr old ) .",
    "the stars are drawn from three recently assembled samples .",
    "first , soderblom et al . ( 1999 ) have produced a well - characterized set of @xmath05000 solar - type stars spread over the entire sky ( see also henry et al .",
    "1996 ) having parallaxes that place the stars within 60 pc , ( b - v ) colors between 0.52 and 0.81 ( f8-k0 spectral types ) , and location in the hertzsprung - russell diagram within 1.0 mag of the solar - metallicity zero - age main sequence .",
    "this sample is fully complete out to 50 pc .",
    "the age distribution in such a volume - limited region around the sun is roughly flat in linear age units out to 2.5 gyr , at which point heating by the galactic disk has increased the scale height of older stars and thus removed them from the volume - limited sample . from this catalog we have selected a sample with ages based on the r@xmath26 chromospheric activity index from @xmath0100 myr to 3 gyr .",
    "however , being located more than 100 pc from the nearest sites of recent star formation , the immediate solar neighborhood is deficient in stars with ages younger than 100 myr .",
    "hence the volume limit was extended in order to identify large enough samples of young stars for the feps project .",
    "we have conducted a new ( e.g. mamajek et al . , 2002 ) and literature - based examination to identify stars whose ages are in the range 3 - 100 myr .",
    "these were selected as having ( b - v ) colors between 0.58 and 1.15 or spectral types g0-k0 , strong x - ray emission , kinematics appropriate for the young galactic disk , and high lithium abundance compared to the 120 myr old pleiades .",
    "young stars are copious coronal x - ray emitters and a large body of literature demonstrates the connection between x - ray emission , chromospheric activity , stellar rotation , and age . the surface density distribution of x - ray sources detected by the rosat all - sky survey reveals a concentration of objects coincident with gould s belt , a feature in the distant solar neighborhood ( 50 - 1000 pc ) comprised of an expanding ring of atomic and molecular gas of which nearly all star - forming regions within 1 kpc are a part .",
    "these x - ray sources are thought to be the dispersed low - mass counterparts to a series of 1 - 100 myr - old open clusters and extant and fossil ob associations that delineate gould s belt ( e.g. torra et al .",
    "2000 ; guillout 1998 ) .",
    "proper motion data enable us to select the nearest of these young , x - ray - emitting stars with space motions consistent with those of higher mass stars having measured parallax , and hence estimate their distances .",
    "follow - up optical spectroscopy of these x - ray + proper motion selected stars is used to confirm youth and determine photospheric properties .",
    "a total of @xmath0600 field stars are x - ray - selected candidate young stars .    finally , stars in nearby well - studied open clusters [ ic 2602 ( 55 myr ) , alpha per ( 90 myr ) , pleiades ( 125 myr ) , hyades ( 650 myr ) ] serve to `` benchmark '' our field star results by providing samples nearly identical in age , composition , and birth environment .",
    "we considered all known members of these clusters meeting our targetted mass / b - v color / spectral type range that were not part of gto samples .    from this large parent sample",
    ", stars were selected for potential observation with spitzer if they met all of the following additional criteria .",
    "the criteria were chosen to ensure sufficient signal - to - noise on the stellar photosphere out to 24 @xmath2 m with spitzer and thus accurate characterization of the underlying photosphere both observationally and with stellar models .",
    "* k @xmath1010 mag ( young @xmath10100 myr x - ray selected and cluster samples ) or k @xmath106.75 mag ( older 0.1 - 3 gyr hipparcos @xmath1 rhk selected sample ) * 24 @xmath2 m background @xmath101.70 mjy / arcsec@xmath27 ( x - ray selected samples ) or @xmath101.54 mjy / arcsec@xmath27 ( hipparcos @xmath1 rhk sample ) * 70 @xmath2 m background @xmath100.76 mjy / arcsec@xmath27 * galactic latitude @xmath28 ( stars in ic 2602 were permitted to violate this criterion ) * quality 2mass jhk photometry , with no flags * no projected 2mass companions closer than 5 \" * no projected 2mass companions closer than 15 \" unless they are _ both _ bluer in j - k _ and _ fainter in k by @xmath113 mag than the spitzer target .",
    "these critera were applied uniformly to our parent sample though in the cases of a few exceptional stars ( such as the ic 2602 sample ) some criteria were violated .",
    "next , targets appearing on spitzer gto programs were removed from the source list .",
    "also , to a limited degree , stars identified through spectroscopy or high resolution imaging literature published through march 2001 as being binary , with companions closer than 2 \" , were removed .",
    "these cases were all either spectroscopic binaries or visual binaries with small delta magnitudes and the literature search was not exhaustive .",
    "subsequent investigation using ao imaging have uncovered additional binary systems with larger delta magnitudes remaining within the feps sample ( e.g. metchev & hillenbrand , 2004 ) .    finally , amongst the stars in our parent sample older than @xmath0600 myr , approximately 1/2 were arbitrarily removed from our program in order to even out the age bins and bring the observing program within the allocated number of spitzer hours ( 350 ) .    based on pre - spitzer spectral energy distributions assembled from the literature , 2mass , iras , iso , and ancillary observations conducted to date ,",
    "several ( 5 - 7 ) of the youngest stars in our program show some hint of circumstellar material . because the stars were randomly selected based on their kinematic and activity properties as derived from optical information",
    ", these previously known dust excesses do not bias the program .    to this source list a set of 14 stars was added , which were suspected to have optically thin dust excesses based on observations from iras and iso .",
    "these stars formed part of our first - look gas disk detection survey and should not be used to derive the statistics of dust debris as a function of age .",
    "our final target list for observations with spitzer and ground - based ancillary programs consists of 328 solar - type stars distributed uniformly in log - age between 3 myr and 3 gyr .",
    "approximately 60 of these are members of the open clusters ic 2602 , alpha per , pleiades or hyades .",
    "the remainder are field stars distributed in distance between 11 and 180 pc .",
    "the relation between distance and age for this sample is shown in figure 3 .",

    "2005 ; see also strom et al .",
    "2005 ) and the other ( top ) excluding those effects . in the former case , dust production diminishes linearly in time as expected for a high density planetestimal belt in collisional equilibrium where dust is ultimately removed through radiation pressure blowout of the smallest fragments ( dominik and decin , 2003 ; wyatt , 2005 ) until the instability occurs at approximately 500600 myr . in the latter case ,",
    "the belt grinds itself down to the low density limit where dust removal is dominated by p ",
    "r drag and the dust mass observed decays at t@xmath43 . in the absence of this instability , our hypothetical solar system is detectable by spitzer with irac ( zodiacal dust disk ) and mips ( kuiper disk ) from 30 pc at age 100 myr , while only the kuiper belt dust would be found at an age of 4.5 gyr . in this way , we can attempt to address whether or not our solar system is common or rare compared to typical stars in the disk of the milky way galaxy .",
    "details concerning this model can be found in meyer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "one deficiency in this model is neglecting the drag on orbiting grains due to stellar winds .",
    "azimuthal wind drag could dominate radiation p - r drag for the high mass - loss rates expected from young solar - type stars ( jura 2004 ) .",
    "this would decrease grain lifetimes in systems that are p ",

    "however , recent work ( wood et al . 2005 ) suggests that the large effects suggested in earlier work ( wood et al .",
    "2002 ) may have been overestimated .",
    "while this effect can be important , its magnitude is still uncertain .",
    "the observed seds from dust disks are determined in part , by the optical properties of the dust contained therein .",
    "both particle size and composition are important in determining the absorption and emission properties of the dust , thus determining its temperature for a given distance from the central star . in the absence of constraints on dust properties from spectral features ,",
    "resolved images of disks in thermal emission or scattered light , or far  ir / sub  mm spectral slopes , models to explain the observed seds of debris disks ar necessarily degenerate ( see for example hines et al .",
    "spectroscopic observations of solid state features can provide important constraints on physical models for the dust .",
    "for example , large particles ( @xmath44 ) are not efficient radiators at their natural resonance frequencies .",
    "thus the absence of expected solid state features from abundant species can indicate a minimize grain size .",
    "similarly , specific chemical compositions of dust can change the shape and central wavelength of resonance features , or indicate significant structural differences in the dust ( e.g. amorphous versus crystalline silicates ) . discerning the difference between mg and fe  rich end member silicates and fractions of amorphous to crystalline silicates provide crucial information concerning the chemical properties of the nebula in which parent body planetesimals formed , as well as the processing history of the dust .",
    "detailed models exploring these effects are described in wolf & hillenbrand ( 2003 ) and bouwman et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "as part of our theory effort we have developed numerical tools to model debris disks originating from an outer belt of planetesimals and evolving under the effect of gravitational perturbation from giant planets in various planetary configurations and for different dust particle sizes and compositions ( moro - martn & malhotra , 2002 ; moro - martn & malhotra , 2003 ; and moro - martn et al .",
    "even though the particle dynamics is chaotic , our method can robustly estimate the equilibrium radial density distribution of dust .",
    "the dust density structure carved by giant planets affects the shape of the disk sed , in a manner that depends upon the the mass and location of the perturbing planet as well as the grain properties ( chemical composition , density and size distribution ) .",
    "we found that the sed of a debris disk with embedded giant planets is fundamentally different from that of a disk without planets , the former showing a significant decrease of the near / mid - ir flux due to the clearing of dust inside the planet s orbit .",
    "the sed is particularly sensitive to the location of the planet , i.e. to the area interior to the planet s orbit that is depleted in dust due to gravitational scattering by the planet .",
    "our dynamical models show that for a planet in a circular orbit with semimajor @xmath45@xmath46 , the radius of the depleted inner zone is in the range of 0.81.2@xmath47 depending upon the planet mass .",
    "our models also show that the dust depletion factor ( i.e.  the ratio between the dust density inside and outside the depleted region ) depends significantly on the planet mass when the mass is in the range @xmath48 .",
    "however , there are two issues that complicate the interpretation of the sed in terms of planet location : ( 1 ) the seds are degenerate .",
    "in particular , there is a degeneracy between the dust grain chemical composition and the semimajor axis of the planet responsible for inner the gap .",
    "for example , the sed of a dust disk dominated by weakly absorbing grains ( fe - poor silicate ) has its minimum at wavelengths longer than those of a disk dominated by strongly absorbing grains ( e.g. carbonaceous and fe - rich silicate ) , which may be mistaken by the presence of a larger inner gap .",
    "this degeneracy can be resolved either with high resolution spectroscopy ( which would constrain the grain chemical composition as discussed above ) , or high spatial resolution images ( which would spatially resolve the inner edge of the dust disk ) .",
    "( 2 ) because of the spitzer sensitivity limit , the debris disks observed by feps may be in the collision - dominated regime , where the dynamics of the dust particles are dominated by collisions rather than p - r drag ( dominik & decin , 2003 ; wyatt , 2005 ) .",
    "this may result in the dust particles suffering multiple collisions , that could break them down into smaller and smaller grains until they are blown out from the system by radiation pressure , before they have time to migrate from the dust - producing plantesimals to a planet - crossing orbit .      in order to interpret our high resolution spectroscopic observations of gas in disks from ages of 3 myr to 100 myr",
    ", we have developed detailed thermo - chemical models of gas and dust in optically thin disks ( gorti & hollenbach 2004 ) .",
    "our models calculate the gas spectral line emission and dust continuum emission for comparison with observed data and thereby infer disk properties .",
    "the models calculate the gas and dust temperatures separately , assuming a balance between the heating and cooling processes .",

    "the gas cools by ionic , atomic and molecular line emission .",
    "the disk temperature structure , vertical density structure , and chemistry is self - consistently calculated in our disk models by requiring thermal balance , vertical pressure equilibrium and by assuming steady - state chemistry .",
    "our chemical network consists of 73 ionic , atomic and molecular species involving h , he , c , o , si , mg , fe and s and 537 reactions . inputs to our models are stellar parameters such as the radiation field at x - ray , uv and visible wavelengths , the disk surface density distribution in gas and dust , and dust properties ( chemical composition and size distribution ) .",
    "most of the stellar and dust parameters are determined through ancillary observations and by modeling of the dust continuum observed through the feps program . for a given dust and gas surface density distribution , our theoretical models can predict the spectral line emission from the gas and the dust continuum emission for comparison to observations .",
    "we are in the process of developing similar gas disk models for younger , optically thick dust disks .",
    "we use a two - layer model for the dust temperature calculation ( chiang & goldreich 1997 ) , and adopt a procedure similar to that for optically thin disks for the gas temperature . the gas and dust temperature",
    "are calculated separately and the emergent line plus continuum spectrum computed .",

    "the feps h@xmath19 program will measure spectral line fluxes ( or upper limits to line fluxes ) and these will be compared with the gas models to infer the gas masses in disks and the spatial distribution of gas ( e.g. hollenbach et al . 2005 ; pascucci et al .",

    "it is important to always keep in mind how the results depend on the input assumptions , as well as explore the full range of model parameters allowed by the data , including the uncertainties .",
    "emission in excess of that expected from the stellar photospheres is found by subtracting model photospheric flux estimates from the observed fluxes across the wavelength range accessible to spitzer .",
    "we execute the following generic analysis for all sources with excess emission of 5 @xmath33 or greater at one or more wavelengths , or equivalent detections of lower snr but at two or more wavlengths .",
    "we begin by calculating an approximate dust temperature if the excess is detected at two or more wavelengths .",
    "if the excess is detected at only one wavelength , we derive a temperature limit using the excess and the bluest broadband point without excess . with this temperature fit to the data",
    ", we then estimate the ratio of excess luminosity in the infrared to the total stellar luminosity @xmath51 .",
    "if the source presents an excess over a broad range of wavelength , we explore whether a range of dust temperatures would be a more appropriate model .",
    "emission that appears to be optically  thick in the direction perpendicular to the disk from the point of view of the observer over a range of wavelength is initially assumed to be a primordial gas  rich disk left over from the formation of the star .",
    "if high resolution irs data are available for the source we can assess whether those these observations constrain the amount of molecular gas remnant in the disk .",
    "other observations such as mm  wave co data or evidence for active accretion onto the star can also suggest a primordial disk .",
    "evidence for a flared disk geometry from the sed can also provide evidence for a gas  rich primordial disk .",
    "if there is no evidence for remnant gas in the disk , we proceed under the premise that the disk might be a debris disk , where the dust we see is generated through collisions of larger parent bodies in a planesimal belt . assuming the grains are large , efficient absorbers and emitters of light",
    ", we can calculate the required dust cross  sectional area for the emitting grains , and determine a plausible radius in the disk for the planetesimal belt . for an excess observed at a wavelength @xmath23",
    ", we can assume that grains larger than @xmath52 can be treated approximately as perfect blackbodies .",
    "given the luminosity of the star , we can also calculate the radiation pressure blow  out size , providing a bound on the smallest particles that could be responsible for the radiation . to further constrain the grain size distribution and composition",
    ", we also search for evidence of solid state emisson features in the irs low resolution spectra obtained for each source . if grains exist in the circumstellar disk at temperatures corresponding to emission at the appropriate wavelength ( e.g. 300 k for the 10 @xmath2 m silicate feature ) , the lack of expected spectral features attributed to specific grain compositions can place constraints on their abundance ( e.g. upper limit to the fraction of crystalline silicates in the debris dust ) or particle size ( grains larger than @xmath53 will not be efficient radiators in the reasonance feature ) or both . these observations , as well as the observed spectral slope in the far  infrared / sub - mm , constrain the grain size distribution , and thus the range of plausible models for the radii in the disk responsible for the emission at a given temperature .",
    "for example , very small grains ( @xmath10 0.1 @xmath2 m ) can reach the same temperature at @xmath11 30 au as very large grains ( @xmath11 10 @xmath2 m ) at @xmath10 3 au ( backman & paresce , 1993 ) .",
    "armed with this information , we can calculate basic quantities such as the mass surface density of emitting grains for a given particle size / radius in the disk .",
    "this enables us to compare the lifetime of grains of various size under the assumption that they are subject to both mutual collisions in the disk as well as the effects of p ",
    "r drag ( e.g. burns et al .",
    "1979 ) . in most cases , observed debris disks have surface densities so high that many collisions will occur between dust grains before they have time to evolve in radius significantly under p ",
    "r drag ( dominik & decin , 2003 ; wyatt , 2005 ) . in this case",
    ", the grains are eroded down to the blowout size and removed from the system through radiation pressure . if the ir excess",
    "is confined to cooler temperatures ( and therefore larger radii ) , we can also place limits on the mass surface density _ inside _ of r@xmath54 and characterize the presence of an inner hole in the dust distribution . in principle , limits on the mass surface density outside of the observed disk radius and r@xmath55 could be constrained by fir and sub - mm observations as well .",
    "in the case where the ir excess is detected with snr @xmath11 5 at several wavelengths , we explore disk model parameters in a robust way by modelling the excess emission and calculating the best ",
    "fit by computing the reduced chi  squared metric . given the number of degrees of freedom in the model , the number of observations , and robust uncertainties in the observations , the reduced chi  squared can provide an estimate of the probability that any parameter lies within a range of values ( confidence interval ) if the data were drawn from a particular model . as a result we can define _",
    "contours _ of allowed ( correlated ) parameters in a multi  dimensional space defined by the model parameters . this requires clearly defined model parameters that can be varied over a range to produce acceptable fits to the data , and clearly defined uncertainties in our data that can be interpreted as errors in a gaussian probablistic sense .    even in the absence of robust parameter estimation described above",
    ", we can often constrain the family of permitted models or offer a preferred model on the basis of likely physical scenarios and occam s razor .",
    "for example , in the case where two models match well the observed excess ( small grains at large radii vs. large grains at smaller radii ) , one can argue that the large grain model might be preferred if the surface density of that model were so large as to enable the disk to maintain an inner hole on the basis of mutual collisions down to the blow  out size .",
    "the small grain at large radii model might have a surface density so low that an interior planet might be required in order to avoid grains filling in the hole under the action of p ",
    "thus the large grain model at small radii requires fewer assumptions and might be preferred .",
    "furthermore , we know that t tauri stars in their youth have optically  thick circumstellar disks from @xmath10 0.1 au that extend to @xmath11 30 au . it might seem implausible to require a massive circumstellar disk composed entirely of small grains @xmath10 1 @xmath2 m at r @xmath11 100 au with no evidence for dust or planetesimals inside of 30 au , rather than a more modest remnant disk composed of larger grains at radii where we know giant planets form and disks exist around sun  like stars ( cf .",

    "<S> we provide an overview of the spitzer legacy program  formation and evolution of planetary systems \" ( feps ) which was proposed in 2000 , begun in 2001 , and executed aboard the spitzer space telescope between 2003 and 2006 . </S>",
    "<S> this program exploits the sensitivity of spitzer to carry out mid - infrared spectrophotometric observations of solar - type stars . with a sample of @xmath0328 stars ranging in age from @xmath03 myr to @xmath03 gyr , we trace the evolution of circumstellar gas and dust from primordial planet - building stages in young circumstellar disks through to older collisionally generated debris disks . </S>",
    "<S> when completed , our program will help define the time scales over which terrestrial and gas giant planets are built , constrain the frequency of planetesimal collisions as a function of time , and establish the diversity of mature planetary architectures .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the observational program , we have coordinated a concomitant theoretical effort aimed at understanding the dynamics of circumstellar dust with and without the effects of embedded planets , dust spectral energy distributions , and atomic and molecular gas line emission . </S>",
    "<S> together with the observations , these efforts will provide astronomical context for understanding whether our solar system  and its habitable planet  is a common or a rare circumstance . </S>",
