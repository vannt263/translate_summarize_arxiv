    "the use of diffractive processes to study the standard model ( sm ) and new physics at the lhc has only been fully appreciated within the last few years ; see , for example @xcite , or the recent reviews @xcite , and references therein . by detecting protons that have lost only about 1 - 3@xmath5 of their longitudinal momentum @xcite , a rich qcd , electroweak , higgs and",
    "bsm programme becomes accessible experimentally , with the potential to study phenomena which are unique to the lhc , and difficult even at a future linear collider .",
    "particularly interesting are the so - called central exclusive production ( cep ) processes which provide an extremely favourable environment to search for , and identify the nature of , new particles at the lhc .",
    "the first that comes to mind are the higgs bosons , but there is also a potentially rich , more exotic , physics menu including ( light ) gluino and squark production , searches for extra dimensions , gluinonia , radions , and indeed any new object which has @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) quantum numbers and couples strongly to gluons , see for instance @xcite . by `` central exclusive '' we mean a process of the type @xmath8 , where the + signs denote the absence of hadronic activity ( that is , the presence of rapidity gaps ) between the outgoing protons and the decay products of the centrally produced system @xmath9 . the basic mechanism driving the process is shown in fig .  [ pxp ] .",
    "the system @xmath9 is produced by the fusion of two active gluons , with a screening gluon exchanged to neutralize the colour.,height=113 ]    there are several reasons why cep is especially attractive for searches for new heavy objects .",
    ", if the outgoing protons remain intact and scatter through small angles then , to a very good approximation , the primary active di - gluon system obeys a @xmath10 , c - even , p - even , selection rule @xcite . here",
    "@xmath11 is the projection of the total angular momentum along the proton beam axis .",
    "this selection rule readily permits a clean determination of the quantum numbers of the observed new ( for example , higgs - like ) resonance , when the dominant production is a scalar state .",
    "_ secondly _ , because the process is exclusive , the energy loss of the outgoing protons is directly related to the mass of the central system , allowing a potentially excellent mass resolution , irrespective of the decay mode of the centrally produced system .",
    "_ thirdly _ , in many topical cases , in particular , for higgs boson production , a signal - to - background ratio of order 1 ( or even better ) is achievable @xcite , @xcite-@xcite . in particular , due to @xmath10 selection , leading - order qcd @xmath12 production is suppressed by a factor @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the transverse energy of the @xmath15 jets .",
    "therefore , for a low mass higgs , @xmath16 gev , there is a possibility to observe the main @xmath12 decay mode @xcite , and to directly measure the @xmath17 yukawa coupling constant .",
    "the signal - to - background ratio may become significantly larger for a higgs boson in certain regions of the mssm parameter space @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , by tagging both of the outgoing protons , the lhc is effectively turned into a gluon - gluon collider .",
    "this will open up a rich , ` high - rate ' qcd physics menu ( especially concerning diffractive phenomena ) , which will allow the study of the skewed , unintegrated gluon densities , as well as the details of rapidity gap survival ; see , for example , @xcite . note that cep provides a source of practically pure gluon jets ; that is we effectively have a ` gluon factory ' @xcite .",
    "this provides an ideal laboratory in which to study the detailed properties of gluon jets , especially in comparison with quark jets .",
    "the forward - proton - tagging approach also offers a unique programme of high - energy photon - interaction physics at the lhc ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the ` benchmark ' cep new physics process is higgs production",
    ". studies of the higgs sector are at the heart of the recent proposal @xcite to complement the lhc central detectors with proton taggers placed at 420 m either side of the interaction point .",
    "our current understanding is , that if a sm - like higgs boson exists in nature , it will be detected at the lhc .",
    "however , various extended models predict a large diversity of higgs - like bosons with different masses , couplings and cp - parities . the best studied extension of the sm up to now is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite , in which there are three neutral higgs bosons , the scalars @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the pseudoscalar @xmath20 .",
    "the forward proton tagging mode is especially advantageous for the study of the mssm sector @xcite .",
    "note that when using the `` standard '' non - diffractive production mechanisms , there is usually an important region of mssm parameter region , where the lhc can detect only the higgs boson with sm - like properties . to check that a discovered state is indeed a scalar higgs boson , and to distinguish between the higgs boson(s ) of the sm or the mssm and",
    "those from of extended higgs theories will be highly non - trivial task . without forward proton tagging",
    ", it would require interplay with observations at the next linear collider .",
    "moreover , within the mssm , the weak - boson - fusion channel becomes of no practical use for the production of the heavier scalar @xmath19 or the pseudoscalar @xmath20 boson . on the other hand , in the forward proton mode the pseudoscalar @xmath20",
    "is practically filtered out , and the detection of the @xmath19 boson should be achievable @xcite .",
    "in addition , in some mssm scenarios , cep provides an excellent opportunity for probing the cp - structure of the higgs sector , either by measuring directly the azimuthal asymmetry of the outgoing tagged protons @xcite or by studying the correlations between the decay products @xcite . in fig .",
    "@xmath21 we show , for reference purposes , the total cep cross section for the sm higgs boson times branching ratio for the @xmath22 and @xmath12 channels , as a function of the higgs mass .",
    "we see that the expected total cross section for the cep of a sm higgs , with mass 120 gev , is 3  fb , falling to just less than 1  fb for a mass of 200 gev ; see @xcite .    with a good understanding of the detectors and favourable experimental conditions , the rate for the sm higgs of mass 120 gev for the integrated lhc luminosity of @xmath23 would be quite sizeable ( around 100 events ) . however , with the presently envisaged lhc detectors , there are various experimental problems .",
    "first of all , trigger signals from protons detected at 420 m can not reach the central detector in time to be used in the level 1 trigger . for this , we have to rely on the central detector .",
    "other factors may also strongly reduce the current expectations for the detected signal rate , in particular , the @xmath24-tagging efficiency , the jet energy resolution etc . at high luminosities",
    "there is also a potentially dangerous problem of backgrounds due to the overlapping events in the same bunch crossing ( the so - called `` pile - up '' events ) . in summary , with the current hardware , the expectation is that there will be not more than a dozen sm higgs signal events for an integrated lhc luminosity of @xmath23 . whether experimental ingenuity will increase this number remains to be seen .",
    "indeed , it is quite possible that `` clever '' hardware and the use of optimized cuts will increase the rate .",
    "for example , the number of @xmath25 events would double if the trigger thresholds on single leptons could be reduced @xcite .",
    "further improvement of the @xmath24-tagging efficiency and of the jet energy resolution would be particularly welcome .",
    "note that the forward - proton mode offers the possibility to study the combined event rate using the so - called trigger cocktail.    as we already mentioned , in the mssm , the cep cross sections can be an order - of - magnitude or more higher @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ratio ] , which shows the contours for the ratio @xmath26 of signal events in the mssm over those in the sm in the cep of @xmath27 in the @xmath28@xmath29 plane , see @xcite .     of the @xmath27 signal events in the mssm over those in the sm in ced process in the @xmath28@xmath29 plane .",
    "the ratio is shown for the @xmath30 benchmark scenario ( with @xmath31 gev ) .",
    "the values of the mass of the lighter cp - even higgs boson , @xmath32 , are indicated by dashed contour lines .",
    "the dark shaded region is excluded by the lep higgs searches.,height=302 ]    as discussed above , the exclusive higgs signal is particularly clean , and the signal - to - background ratio is quite favourable , at least , at an instantaneous luminosity @xmath33 , when the effect of pile - up can be kept under control , see @xcite .",
    "however , without improving the lhc hardware , the expected event rate in the sm case is quite limited , and so it is important to test various ingredients of the adopted theoretical scheme @xcite by studying the related processes at the existing experimental facilities , hera and the tevatron .",
    "various such tests have been performed so far , see for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "quite recently the predictions for the non - perturbative so - called survival factor have been confronted with hera data on the leading neutron spectra @xcite .",
    "the straightforward checks come from the study of processes which are mediated by the same mechanism as cep of the higgs boson , but with rates which are sufficiently high , so that they may be observed at the tevatron ( as well as at the lhc ) .",
    "the most obvious examples are those in which the higgs is replaced by either a dijet system , or a @xmath34 meson , or a @xmath35 pair .",
    "the reported preliminary cdf data on these cep processes ( see for example,@xcite ) show a reasonable agreement with the theoretical expectations by durham group , see also @xcite .    especially impressive",
    "are the recent cdf data @xcite on exclusive production of a pair of high @xmath14 jets , @xmath36 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite such measurements could provide an effective @xmath37 ` luminosity monitor ' just in the kinematical region appropriate for higgs production .",
    "the corresponding cross section was evaluated to be about 10@xmath38 times larger than that for the production of a sm higgs boson .",
    "since the dijet cep cross section is rather large , this process appears to be an ideal ` standard candle ' .",
    "a comparison of the data with analytical predictions @xcite is given in fig .",
    "it shows the @xmath40 dependence for the dijet events with @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the invariant energy of the incoming pomeron - pomeron system . the agreement with the theoretical expectations @xcite lends credence to the predictions for the ced higgs production @xcite .",
    "[ h ]    = 0.6",
    "the importance of the @xmath43 process , in particular as a susy higgs search mode , means that the physical backgrounds to this reaction must be thoroughly addressed .",
    "recall that the unique advantage of the @xmath12 cep process is the @xmath10 selection rule , which requires the lo @xmath44 background to vanish in the limit of massless quarks and forward going protons . however , there are still four main sources of background @xcite .",
    "these are the contributions from the following subprocesses .    *",
    "the prolific ( lo ) @xmath45 subprocess can mimic @xmath12 production since we may misidentify the gluons as @xmath24 and @xmath46 jets . *",
    "an admixture of @xmath47 production , arising from non - forward going protons , which contributes to the ( qhc ) lo @xmath44 background . * because of non - zero mass of the quark there is a contribution to the @xmath10 ( qhnc ) cross section of order @xmath48 .",
    "this term currently raises the main concern .",
    "the problem is that the result is strongly affected by the ( uncomfortably large ) higher - order qcd effects see @xcite . in particular , the one - loop double logarithmic contribution exceeds the born term , and the final result becomes strongly dependent on the nnlo effects , as well as on the scale @xmath49 of the qcd coupling @xmath50 and on the running @xmath24  quark mass .",
    "there is no complete calculation of these higher - order effects for the @xmath44 process , but only estimates based on a seemingly plausible hypotheses regarding the nnlo effects @xcite .",
    "the validity of these estimates has an accuracy not better than a factor of 2 - 4 .",
    "this contribution is the main source of the theoretical uncertainty in the current predictions for the non - pile - up background .",
    "the good news is that this contribution decreases with increasing @xmath14 much faster than the other background terms @xcite . *",
    "finally , there is a possibility of nlo @xmath51 background contributions , which for large angle , hard gluon radiation do not obey the selection rules , see @xcite . of course , in principle , the extra gluon may be observed experimentally and the contribution of such background events reduced . however , there are important exceptions @xcite .",
    "first , the extra gluon may go unobserved in the direction of a forward proton .",
    "this background is reduced by requiring the approximate equality @xmath52 .",
    "calculations @xcite show that this background does not exceed 5@xmath5 of the sm higgs signal , and so it may be safely neglected .",
    "the remaining danger is large - angle hard gluon emission which is collinear with either the @xmath24 or @xmath46 jet , and , therefore , unobservable .",
    "this background source results in a sizeable contribution which should be included , see @xcite .",
    "there are also other ( potentially worrying ) background sources , which after a thorough investigation @xcite , have been omitted in the final expression for the @xmath53 background in @xcite .",
    "this is either because their contributions are numerically small from the very beginning , or because they can be reduced to an acceptable level by straightforward experimental cuts . among these",
    ", there is the nnlo qhc ( `` cut non - reconstructible '' ) contribution to the exclusive process , which comes from the one - loop box diagrams .",
    "this contribution is not mass - suppressed and is potentially important , especially for large @xmath54 . however , for masses below 300 gev , this contribution is comparatively small .",
    "next , a potential background source can arise from the collision of two soft pomerons",
    ". this can result in the two main categories of events :    * central higgs boson production accompanied by two ( or more ) additional gluon jets , * production of a high @xmath14 @xmath12-pair accompanied by the gluon jets .    in these cases",
    "the higgs boson or the @xmath12 pair are produced in the collision of two gluons ( from the pomeron wave functions ) via the hard subprocesses ( @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) similar to the usual inelastic event . in",
    "both processes the mass , @xmath57 , of the central @xmath12 system ( resulting either from the higgs decay or from the qcd background ) is not equal to the ` pomeron - pomeron ' mass @xmath58 , measured by the proton detectors .",
    "the suppression of such backgrounds is controlled by the requirement that @xmath59 should lie within the @xmath60 mass interval .",
    "these backgrounds were carefully evaluated in @xcite , and it was found that they are quite small . indeed , if we use the mrw2006 dpdfs @xcite , and take @xmath61 gev , then the @xmath62 and @xmath63 contributions are each less than about 6@xmath5 of the sm higgs signal .",
    "finally , a potential background could result from the emissions of additional gluons .",
    "a particular case , caused by the qcd @xmath64 process , was already addressed in the item ( iv ) above .",
    "there may also be a contribution coming from the @xmath65 production process .",
    "this contribution is suppressed by the requirement that the @xmath66-channel two - gluon exchange across the gap region should be colourless .",
    "thus , there is no single gluon radiation , and the non - zero contribution starts from @xmath67 .",
    "next , we have to impose the mass matching condition discussed in the item ( iv ) above .",
    "numerically , this background appears to be small ( about 15@xmath5 of the sm higgs signal @xcite ) and , again , it can be neglected .",
    "it should be noted that the effect of gluon emission off the screening gluon ( see fig .",
    "[ pxp ] ) is also numerically small .    in summary ,",
    "the main background contributions come from exclusive dijet production as listed in the items ( i)-(iv ) above . within the accuracy of the existing calculations @xcite , the overall background to the @xmath68 higgs signal in the @xmath69 mode",
    "can be approximated by the following formula , see @xcite 0.5 fb / gev , [ eq : backbb ] where the first term in the square brackets corresponds to the processes listed in items ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iv ) , while the last term comes from the mass - suppressed term described in item ( iii ) .",
    "we emphasize that this approximate expression may be used only for the purposes of making quick estimates of the background , since no detector simulation has been performed .",
    "we expect that such a simulation , together with the optimization procedure , will further reduce the effect of background .",
    "although the @xmath27 signal has special advantages , we have discussed problems which arise , in the sm case , to render it challenging from an experimental perspective . in @xcite , attention was turned to the @xmath22 decay mode .",
    "triggering on this channel is not a problem , since the final state is rich in high-@xmath71 leptons .",
    "efficiencies of about 20@xmath5 can be achieved if the standard leptonic and di - leptonic trigger thresholds are applied .",
    "the advantages of forward proton tagging are , however , still explicit . even for the gold - plated double leptonic decay channel",
    ", the mass resolution will be very good , and , of course , the observation of the higgs with the tagged protons immediately establishes its quantum numbers .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that there would be a detectable signal with a small and controllable background for the ced production of a sm - like higgs boson in the mass interval between 140 gev and 200 gev .",
    "unfortunately , with the standard lepton triggers and experimental acceptances and selections  @xcite , currently we can expect only a handful of @xmath72 events from a 120 gev sm higgs for @xmath73 .",
    "the rate of detected events could rise after further modifications of hardware .",
    "for example , the reduction of the level  1 leptonic trigger thresholds would allow the statistics to double .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the situation would improve in favourable regions of the mssm parameter space , but here , unlike the @xmath69 mode , the expected rise , as compared to sm , is not dramatic , no more than a factor of 4 - 5 . in order to fully exploit all the advantages of the @xmath22 channel more dedicated experimental studies",
    "are needed .",
    "the installation of proton - tagging detectors in the distant forward regions around the atlas and/or cms central detectors would add unique capabilities to the existing lhc experimental programme .",
    "the calculation of the rates of cep processes show that there is a real chance that new heavy particle production could be observed in this mode . for a higgs boson",
    "this would amount to a direct determination of its quantum numbers . for certain mssm scenarios",
    ", the tagged - proton channel may even be the higgs discovery channel .",
    "moreover , with sufficient luminosity , proton tagging may provide direct evidence of cp - violation within the higgs sector .",
    "there is also a rich qcd , electroweak , and more exotic physics , menu .",
    "this includes searches for extra dimensions , light gluino and squark production , gluinonia , radions , and , indeed , any object which has @xmath6 or @xmath7 quantum numbers and which couples strongly to gluons @xcite .",
    "here we focused on the unique advantages of cep higgs production .",
    "the events are clean , but the predicted yield for the sm higgs for an integrated luminosity of @xmath73 is comparatively low , after experimental cuts and acceptances .",
    "further efforts to optimize the event selection and cut procedure are very desirable .",
    "the signal - to - background ratio in the @xmath69 mode is about 1 , depending crucially on the accuracy with which @xmath74 can be measured . in the mssm",
    "there are certain regions of parameter space which can be especially ` proton tagging friendly ' @xcite . here",
    "the signal - to - background ratios in the @xmath69 channel can exceed the sm by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the observation of the decay of higgs to @xmath69 would allow a direct determination of the @xmath24  yukawa coupling .    from the experimental perspective ,",
    "the simplest exclusive channel in which to observe a sm higgs boson with mass between 140 gev and 200 gev is the @xmath22 decay mode . according to studies in @xcite",
    ", there will be a detectable signal at @xmath73 , and the non - pile - up backgrounds are small and controllable .",
    "however , contrary to the @xmath69 case , no dramatic rise in the rate is expected within the mssm .    potentially , the pile - up events could endanger the prospects of cep studies at high luminosities .",
    "currently the situation is far from being hopeless , but further detailed studies are needed .",
    "the pile - up is currently under very intensive scrutiny by both , atlas and cms ; for a detailed discussion , see @xcite , ( see also @xcite ) .",
