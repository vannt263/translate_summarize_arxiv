    "<S> we establish a set of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions in the lipkin - meshkov - glick model under monochromatic modulation of the inter - particle interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the external driving induces a rich phase diagram that characterizes the multistability in the system . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the number of stable configurations can be tuned by increasing the amplitude of the driving field . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by studying the quantum evolution , we demonstrate that the system exhibits a set of quantum phases that correspond to dynamically stabilized states .    </S>",
    "<S> a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) is a drastic change of state of a many - body system which occurs at zero temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to thermodynamic phase transitions  which are driven by thermal fluctuations , qpts are entirely driven by quantum fluctuations . rather recently </S>",
    "<S> , there is an increasing interest in the study of many - particle systems under the an external variation of the parameters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , recent works explore the quantum dynamics of topological states of matter controlled by a driving field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent investigations show that by means of monochromatic fields , unconventional quantum phases in the dicke model @xcite and the quantum ising model @xcite can be generated , which are unaccessible in their undriven counterparts .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to undriven qpts , transitions to excited levels are induced as a result of the external driving , even if the system is prepared initially in the ground state of the undriven model . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , signatures of quantum criticality can also appear in excited states . </S>",
    "<S> a similar issue has been explored in undriven models , where a recent line of research are excited - state phase transitions , e.g. in mean - field type qpts such as the lipkin - meshkov - glick @xcite or the dicke superradiance @xcite model . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the connection between chaos and criticality @xcite has been studied in detail for the interacting boson model @xcite . despite of the original motivation of the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model as a toy model to test approximation methods in manybody physics @xcite , currently it constitutes an active field of research and a natural scenario to study the relation between qpts and spin squeezing @xcite and quantum fisher information as a resource for high - precision quantum estimation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , rather recently , experimental realizations of the lmg model in optical cavity qed @xcite and circuit qed @xcite have been suggested .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we study a driven version of the lmg model in which we assume a time - dependent inter - particle interaction . in comparison with previous works which considered dynamical properties of the lmg model under an adiabatic change of parameters of the system across the quantum critical point @xcite , the effect of fast and slow quenches of the transverse field @xcite , and a periodically - driven uniaxial lmg model @xcite , we address here the fundamental issue of driving - induced qpts in the lmg model .    </S>",
    "<S> the current experimental feasibilities allow us to control externally the parameters of many - body systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the kicked top , has been realized experimentally in an ensemble of laser - cooled cs atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , an optical realization of the uniaxial driven lmg in photonic lattices @xcite and by using superconducting charge qubits connected in parallel to a common superconductor inductance @xcite have been suggested .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that when the driving is near resonance with the excitation energy of the undriven system the nature of criticality changes dramatically . additionally , we find that the external driving induces stable configurations which do not have analogue in the undriven system . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to a novel route of experimental studies exploring the characteristics of criticality under nonequilibrium conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> a more specific outline of our paper is as follows . in section [ sectioni ] </S>",
    "<S> we describe the fundamentals on the qpt in the undriven lmg model and construct a bosonized effective hamiltonian which allows us to describe the stability properties of the symmetric phase . in section [ sectionii ] </S>",
    "<S> we find an effective hamiltonian by using the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and describe the quantum evolution of the observables to understand the characteristics of the novel nonequilibrium metastable phases . </S>",
    "<S> finally , conclusive remarks are given in section [ sectioniii ] . </S>"
