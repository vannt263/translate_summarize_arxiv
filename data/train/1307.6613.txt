    "the first thing to notice is that a configuration with impurities on the same rung breaks the ladder and the elementary excitation is then a magnon in the largest piece which energy cost is slightly larger than the spin gap . such effect does not enter in the effective model since no spin-@xmath0 is located at the vicinity of an impurity in that case .    without frustration ( @xmath79 ) , the effective interaction oscillates at @xmath108 , even at short distances , except when @xmath109 for which the effective coupling is almost zero within dmrg accuracy .",

    "we here discuss the nature of the couplings distribution @xmath113 resulting from doping the ladder and which is a central quantity for the understanding of the magnetic responses .",

    "chain breaking effects should lower this value since configurations where two impurities are on the same rung do not bring any free spin .",
    "taking this effect into account gives an expected saturation at @xmath335 .",
    "this effect matters for dmrg or qmc data as well as experiments .",
    "using the random dimer model , the low - temperature magnetization curve ( for @xmath336 ) takes a fermi - dirac form to a good approximation @xmath337 where @xmath234 plays the role of the chemical potential .",
    "this is physically transparent as the system is equivalent in this limit to a collection of two - level systems with only the singlet and triplet @xmath338 states contributing to the low - energy physics which naturally maps onto fermionic statistics .    in particular , the @xmath188 limit of this model",
    "gives that the magnetic curve is simply related to the repartition function @xmath339 of the couplings through @xmath340 . in the case of the continuous distribution , this yields a power - law behavior @xmath341 with @xmath269 and for @xmath342 , which already deviates significantly from the brillouin picture .",
    "it is important to notice that situation where @xmath343 from is physical in the case of systems with a large correlation length @xmath344 .",
    "then , the curvature of the magnetic curve is expected to change from concave to convex .     and finite temperature .",
    "@xmath345 represents the magnetization jump . ]",
    "still , we see that the random dimer model fails to reproduce the correct @xmath257 limit and gives for the jump @xmath346 ( @xmath347 for eq .  ) .",
    "one can incorporate the exact result in the rdm by stretching the repartition function of antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath348 .",
    "we thus define the phenomenological  stretched random dimer  ansatz as @xmath349 physically , the issue of the random dimer model is that it works with total spins @xmath350 and @xmath351 and can not capture the large - spin formation . these features and ansatz of the random dimer model",
    "are represented on fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetization - rdm](a ) .",
    "lastly , this rough understanding of the shape of the curve leads to the following simple power - law fit which could be useful for experiments or numerical calculations : @xmath352 in which one can leave free the three parameters @xmath345 , @xmath102 and @xmath268 . interestingly ,",
    "rsrg arguments  @xcite have also proposed a power - law behavior for the magnetic curve when @xmath353 based on energy scales phenomenology .",
    "we compute numerically the magnetization curves at zero temperature using dmrg on the microscopic model and average over many configurations .",
    "the results for the isotropic ladder @xmath354 are displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetization - t0](a - b ) for both a system without frustration and with frustration in the incommensurate regime .",
    "qualitatively , the two curve are essentially governed by the coupling distribution and frustration does not have a drastic qualitative effect .",
    "interestingly , the simple approximations described in the preceding section account rather well of the behavior of the curve .",
    "first , the ed on the effective model captures the power - law like behavior and even underlines the discrete nature of the coupling distribution .",
    "this discrete nature is transparent from the ansatz using the exact effective couplings .",
    "the dmrg does show faded steps corresponding to the larger couplings , and ed too .",
    "the envelope of the random dimer model is captured by the continuous version of the coupling distribution .",
    "yet , we see that one really needs the discretized version to be quantitative .",
    "last , we show that a fit of the form captures the mean power - law behavior of the curve in a satisfactory way .",
    "this is all the more relevant as we will see that temperature tends to fade the steps due to the discrete couplings .",
    "one can notice the slight difference between the ed and dmrg results .",
    "we attribute these to two main possible effects .",
    "first , as the systems are chosen to have the same total number of impurities , the limitation of the two - body interaction effective model can play a role .",
    "many - impurity interactions could become relevant even though these are subdominant effects .",
    "second , we have seen that chain breaking effects must make the saturation plateau occur at @xmath355 , but it also has the effect of averaging magnetic curves over various dopings .",
    "indeed , in the presence of chain breaking effects , each piece has a different doping which approaches @xmath19 on average but can be lower or higher .",
    "this should have significant effects compare to the fixed @xmath19 curve of the ed on the effective model .",
    "the last important remark is that no saturation plateau is reached in the isotropic ladder . as for the curie constant plateau ,",
    "this is due to the fact that the typical energy scales are of the same order of magnitude @xmath356 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : j0 ] ) .",
    "then , magnons become activated by the magnetic field before all impurities are truly polarized . the energy scales separation in the strong - coupling limit suggests that such a plateau could be possible at large @xmath322 but we have not investigated this situation in details . in particular , the microscopic model displays small couplings in this limit which are harder to capture with dmrg .",
    "the approximation of eq .  , naturally yields low - temperature corrections from a sommerfeld expansion , valid provided @xmath357 , which reads @xmath358 , where @xmath359 is the derivative of the coupling distribution . for instance , in the case of the continuous distribution and taking the approximation @xmath360 , the temperature corrections depend on doping and magnetic field through @xmath361 here again , the response to a small temperature is expected to strongly depend on the side of the limiting case @xmath362 , displaying a change in sign on the corrections . in the particular situation",
    "where @xmath362 , for which @xmath113 is flat , the magnetization curve of the random dimer model can actually be computed exactly @xmath363}{1 + 2\\cosh[h / t ] } \\\\ & \\times \\frac{t}{j_0}\\ln\\left\\ { \\frac{1+e^{j_0/t}(1 + 2\\cosh[h / t])}{1+e^{-j_0/t}(1 + 2\\cosh[h / t ] ) } \\right\\}\\;.   \\end{split } \\label{eq : m - exact - z1}\\ ] ] following the previous remark on the inability of the random dimer model to account for the large - spin formation , we can devise an extension of the stretched dimer model at finite temperatures using the following ansatz : @xmath364 where the first part accounts for the contribution of ferromagnetic couplings , while the second accounts for the magnetization process of antiferromagnetic dimers .",
    "the first term should in principle correspond to a brillouin function of spin @xmath195 but this version already gives satisfactory results",
    ".       of depleted ladders of size @xmath365 sites , averaged over @xmath366 disordered samples , at finite temperature @xmath367 .",
    "different impurity concentrations @xmath368 are shown , together with the clean case at the same temperature for comparison .",
    "horizontal dashed lines show the expected saturation value for the impurities @xmath369 , and the full lines are ed results obtained with pbc on 1000 random clusters of 10 impurities from which one clearly sees that the saturation value is only reached when @xmath370 . ]",
    "the effect of temperature is first discussed on fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetization - finitet ] by showing the comparison between the brillouin response to the ed and random dimer model predictions for four increasing temperatures .",
    "all curves should collapse at high temperatures @xmath248 .",
    "we see that the zero - temperature steps are rapidly faded as temperature is turn on .",
    "still , the deviation from the brillouin curve due to the interaction remains well visible for finite temperature and actually makes the random dimer model almost exact .    in order to validate the above comparison",
    ", we have compared the ed on the effective model to qmc , which is the appropriate method for finite temperature calculations on the microscopic model . in fig .",
    "[ fig : magnetization ] , one observes a rather good agreement for several realistic dopings .",
    "the larger the doping , the larger the deviation from the brillouin curve is and the larger the distance from saturation is when the magnons set in .",
    "the slight difference between ed and qmc could here again be attributed to many - impurities interactions not taken into account in the effective model and also to the effective doping averaging induced by chain breaking effects , as for the zero - temperature curve .",
    "then , the following message is almost quantitatively correct from the comparison between all different approaches : the low - part of the magnetic curve probes the couplings distribution between the impurities .",
    "this is evident in the random dimer model and the picture survives to the microscopic model rather well .",
    "this simple analysis is certainly due to the fact that we are discussing a simple observable ( density of magnetization ) which is little affected by low - energy behavior or correlations in the system .",
    "therefore , it could be accessible and interesting to test such phenomenology in experiments working with quasi one - dimensional systems .",
    "our theoretical study could in principle apply to several realistic spin gapped materials .",
    "however , as seen above , a clear separation between different energy scales  the spin gap @xmath3 below which free local moments are expected , and the largest effective coupling @xmath105 below which they start to correlate upon random f - af exchanges  would be difficult to achieve in systems close to the isotropic ladder limit .",
    "the separation remains plausible in the strong - coupling limit , although we have not investigate this point quantitatively in this paper . in the isotropic case",
    ", a saturation regime of impurity spins will be hardly detectable .",
    "nevertheless , the regime of large spin could be detected in curie tails at low temperature , provided the three dimensional ordering of induced moments ( expected below temperatures set by three dimensional couplings ) occurs at low enough temperature .",
    "in such a respect , a new analysis of susceptibility data of zn ( @xmath350 ) or ni ( @xmath351 ) doped bicu@xmath1po@xmath2 form ref .   may give interesting results , although the three dimensional ordering of induced moments occurs below a few kelvins  @xcite .",
    "perhaps more promising is the doped haldane chain system y@xmath1banio@xmath7  @xcite where a very small inter - chain coupling @xmath371 k is expected from neutron scattering  @xcite despite a very large spin gap @xmath372 k.    more generally , our study clearly shows that curie tails , present in all af materials even for undoped ones , because of intrinsic defects or imry - ma domain formation with random couplings  @xcite , have to be analyzed perhaps more carefully than what is usually done . in particular , the assumption of free impurities leading to the extraction of their concentration @xmath19 through the simple form @xmath373 is not expected to be valid in many experimental situations .    regarding the magnetization curve , our work can potentially apply to many materials where brillouin - like responses are observed upon increasing the external field . for spin - gapped systems , the effective couplings between local moments can strongly renormalize downwards the brillouin - like magnetization , and pushes the saturation towards larger magnetic fields , possibly larger than the spin gap @xmath3 .",
    "this means that , at the critical field where magnon excitations start to appear , not all impurity - induced moments have been saturated .",
    "such a phenomenology is expected for bicu@xmath1po@xmath2 in a field  @xcite . nevertheless , for this ladder material  @xcite , and also for other systems such as the herbertsmithite kagom compound  @xcite , the presence of non - negligible dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm )",
    "anisotropies make the situation much more difficult to analyze since dm terms induce a finite magnetic response also below the spin gap .",
    "the modification of the brillouin - like response due to the competition between impurity physics and dm interactions in an external field at finite temperature is a very interesting subject , relevant for many realistic systems , that we leave for future studies .",
    "the physics of randomly depleted ladder , studied initially in the seminal work of sigrist and furusaki  @xcite , offers a remarkable playground for studying the effect of impurity disorder in gapped systems without and with frustration . in this contribution to the field , we improved on several intuitive results of ref .   to provide quantitative predictions and comparison to numerics and adressed the shape of the magnetization curve .",
    "based on a detailed analysis of the effective couplings between impurities and of the corresponding coupling distribution , we focussed the main two magnetic responses : the zero - field susceptibility , through the temperature - dependent curie constant , and the magnetization curve .",
    "the first one is shown to have a non - trivial power - law behavior at very - low temperature in qualitative agreement with a rsrg scenario . the high - temperature deviation from free impurity spins",
    "is well captured by a simple random dimer model .",
    "this model also accounts qualitatively well for the magnetization curve for which we give several phenomenological fits at zero and finite - temperature which are in good agreement with accurate numerical calculations .",
    "one of the key outcome of this study is that incommensurability ( induced by frustration ) plays little role in the local quantities we looked at .",
    "indeed , the main consequence of incommensurability is a mere reduction of the zero - temperature spontaneous magnetization and of the low - temperature limit of the curie constant .",
    "the situation might be different in higher dimensional system but the one - dimensional version seems to be in the same universality class , as expected from rsrg arguments .",
    "these predictions on the magnetic responses could motivate experiments in that direction since the required temperatures and magnetic fields are accessible for several compounds .",
