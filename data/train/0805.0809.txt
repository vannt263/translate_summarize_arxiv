    "<S> the cms experiment will provide good quality measurements of yields and spectra of identified charged and neutral particles , both in p - p and heavy - ion collisions , thus contributing to the study of soft hadronic physics at the lhc energies .    the cms experiment at the lhc is a general purpose detector designed to explore physics at the tev energy scale @xcite . </S>",
