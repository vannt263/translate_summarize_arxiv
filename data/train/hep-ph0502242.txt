    "however it turns out that _ the simplest scenario with @xmath6 does not work : the tau condensation is favoured instead of the top . _    on the other hand , it is known that field theories in six dimensions have several interesting features relating to proton stability  @xcite , explanation of the number of the generations of fermions  @xcite , etc .. in order to construct a viable top condensate model in six dimensions , a strong interaction other than the six dimensional qcd should be required , because the attractive force provided by the bulk qcd is not sufficient to generate the top condensate . a candidate for such a strong interaction",
    "is topcolor .",
    "@xcite ( see for reviews refs .  @xcite . )",
    "we may introduce the topcolor interaction in the bulk .",
    "topcolor should be broken down in low energy . in four dimensions",
    ", some involved dynamical mechanism is needed in order to break topcolor , unless a ( composite ) scalar field is introduced for simplicity . as for the gauge symmetry breaking , the extra dimension scenario has an advantage : the gauge symmetry breaking can be easily achieved by imposing appropriate boundary conditions ( bc s ) .",
    "@xcite on the basis of more general bc s , the higgsless theory was proposed  @xcite .",
    "the gauge symmetry breaking mechanism via nontrivial bc s can be also applied to other models for the dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we here study nontrivial bc s for the topcolor breaking along with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "benefits of the topcolor breaking through nontrivial bc s are as follows : the mechanism is very simple and hence it is easy to extend to various models .",
    "we can break spontaneously the topcolor gauge symmetry without introducing explicitly a ( composite ) scalar field and thereby we can carry out the model building incorporating only fermions and gauge bosons ( in the bulk ) . in passing ,",
    "the topcolor gauge bosons do not have mass terms in the bulk in the gauge breaking mechanism via the bc s .",
    "therefore the theory does not provide four - fermion ( njl - type ) interactions in the bulk , unlike four dimensional topcolor models .",
    "let us investigate a six dimensional topcolor model with the @xmath7 gauge symmetry .",
    "we assign the topcolor charge , @xmath8 , to the top and bottom quarks in the bulk , while we do the @xmath9 charge to the first and second generation quarks in the bulk .",
    "we then impose the nontrivial bc s so that @xmath7 breaks down to the diagonal subgroup , which is identified to qcd .",
    "we also put the electroweak gauge interaction in the bulk and hence the electroweak gauge sector is the same as the universal extra dimension model  @xcite . in order to obtain the chiral fermion in four dimensions , we apply the compactification on a square proposed by dobrescu and pontn  @xcite , which is closely related to the compactification on the orbifold @xmath10 .    for a viable model",
    "it is required that only the top condensation occurs while other condensations such as bottom and leptons do not .",
    "the up and charm condensations should be suppressed as well .",
    "we call the requirement `` tmac condition '' and the energy scale `` tmac scale '' as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "once we specify the model , the renormalization group ( rg ) flows of the gauge couplings can be determined through the truncated kaluza - klein ( kk ) effective theory  @xcite .",
    "the running effects are very important to study the tmac scale .",
    "suppression of the up and charm condensations can be realized by the difference of the gauge coupling strengths between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "since the non - abelian gauge theory in the bulk has the ultraviolet fixed point ( uvfp ) within the truncated kk effective theory  @xcite , the difference is essentially determined by the values of the uvfp for @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "note that the value of the uvfp is controlled by the number @xmath11 of fermions , i.e. , the model parameter , and that the value increases as the number @xmath11 is larger . in our model",
    ", we assign the @xmath9 charge to the first and second generation quarks , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "therefore we need to introduce more than three ( vector - like heavy ) fermions with the @xmath8 charge other than the top and bottom quarks .",
    "we then find that the top condensation takes place while the up and charm condensations are actually suppressed .",
    "can we realize the mass hierarchy between the top and bottom ?",
    "we here note that the bulk hypercharge interaction @xmath0 rapidly becomes strong owing to the power - like running .",
    "thus the @xmath13 tilting mechanism to suppress the bottom quark condensation is automatically incorporated in our model .",
    "however the lepton condensation is apparently favoured extremely near the landau pole of @xmath0 .",
    "it means that the tmac scale will be found in the region that it is large enough to suppress the bottom condensation while it is smaller than the scale for the lepton condensation .",
    "we concretely analyze the tmac scale by using the ladder sd equation and depict the results in two dimensional plane of the cutoff @xmath14 and the ratio of the topcolor and qcd couplings @xmath15 at the compactification scale @xmath16 . for a slice @xmath17 , for example",

    "both of the top and bottom condensations take place . if we choose the ratio of the values of the topcolor and qcd couplings at @xmath184 10 tev to @xmath220@xmath221 , the tmac region is @xmath18@xmath19 . in the region",
    "it turns out that the up- and charm - condensations do not occur . for @xmath222",
    "the lepton condensation is favoured .",
    "similarly , the tmac regions are also found for models with @xmath223 .",
    "however the regions become narrower : for @xmath224@xmath225 , @xmath226@xmath19 , @xmath227 ; for @xmath228@xmath229 , @xmath230@xmath19 , @xmath231 .",
    "we studied the topcolor model in the six dimensional bulk .",
    "we assigned the nontrivial bc s to the topcolor gauge fields so that the topcolor is broken down on the boundaries .",
    "as a three generation model we considered the model whose charge assignments are shown in table  [ tab1 ] . since the top and bottom quarks have the topcolor charge while the other quarks do not in the model , the up and charm condensations are unlikely to occur . when the bulk @xmath0 interaction is sufficiently strong , the bottom condensation is also suppressed . in this way",
    ", we can expect that only the top quark condenses , which is required for a viable model . in order to demonstrate the existence of such a situation",
    ", we analyzed the ladder sd equation including the rge effects of the bulk gauge couplings .",
    "we then found that the situation can be realized in the `` top '' region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which is the result for the model with three extra ( heavy ) vector - like fermions having the topcolor charge , i.e. , @xmath219 .",
    "for example , when the ratio of the couplings of topcolor and qcd is taken to @xmath220@xmath221 with @xmath232 being the compactification scale , the cutoff @xmath14 should be @xmath18@xmath19 .",
    "the models with @xmath223 may be possible as well .",
    "the electroweak gauge sector of the model is the same as the universal extra dimension model  @xcite .",
    "the compactification scale @xmath16 is severely constrained by the lep precision data  @xcite . since the kk modes of bulk fermions are vector - like , the constraint from the @xmath233 parameter is suppressed , @xmath234 .",
    "hence the @xmath114-parameter constraint is essential",
    ". we may estimate the @xmath114-parameter as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath235 where we neglected @xmath236 contributions .",
    "when we take @xmath237 or @xmath238 with @xmath239 , the estimate of the @xmath114-parameter is @xmath240 the current constraint @xmath241 at @xmath242 c.l . with the higgs boson mass @xmath243 gev  @xcite yields @xmath244@xmath245  tev .",
    "for larger @xmath246 the lower bound of @xmath16 gets smaller . for the reference value @xmath247 tev",
    ", we can expect that the contributions of kk modes to the @xmath114-parameter is negligibly small , even if we take into account errors arising from nonperturbative effects .",
    "if the compactification scale @xmath16 is larger than a several tev , the kk modes will not be observed directly in lhc .",
    "in such a case , the higgs production via the gluon fusion process may become important in order to discriminate the present model from the sm .",
    "@xcite    the mass of the top quark may be predicted larger than the experimental value , because a stronger gauge coupling than qcd was used in the model and the top - yukawa couplings is determined through the infrared value of the gauge coupling from the viewpoint of rges  @xcite .",
    "if so , the top - seesaw mechanism  @xcite is helpful .",
    "when we apply the top - seesaw scheme , we need to introduce a heavy fermion with the same charge assignment as @xmath248 .",
    "our approach is very sensitive to the cutoff , so that the uv completion by theory space  @xcite may be required .",
