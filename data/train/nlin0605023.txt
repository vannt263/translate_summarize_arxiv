    "numerous works have inspired physicists and guided them towards the studies of financial markets .",
    "we could start with bachelier ( 1900 ) @xcite who introduced what shall perhaps remain the simplest and most successful model for price variations based on gaussian statistics @xcite . on the other hand , pareto ( 1897 )",
    "@xcite had observed that large price variations seem to be described by a curve interpolating between two power - laws .    for an econophysicist using statistical mechanics as primary support of investigations",
    ", nature seems to work as a `` self - organized system '' .",
    "@xcite `` scaling laws '' are everywhere , but rarely contain cycles .",
    "nevertheless it is understandable that physicists try to convince themselves that there is some punctuated equilibrium in economy , i.e. a market can be in a metastable equilibrium .",
    "a fundamental question is that of ` value' ; not only value of money , but more generally the value of goods @xcite .",
    "in fact , in extreme situations , prices may not represent actual values .",
    "for instance , in the aftermath of a natural disaster , the amount of destruction - measured using pre - disaster prices - is a poor proxy for actual welfare losses , because of reconstruction constraints and interactions with basic needs . we will not debate on whether there is a real value of goods here , but will consider whether in absence of such a notion a  free  market can exist , and if so what would be its characteristics .",
    "markets surely started through barter , but later exchange of goods needed money for a surviving economy in the real world , money seems needed for a functioning of the economy .",
    "changes in the quantity of money may affect this functioning through inflation and deflation processes .",
    "however , there is strong empirical evidence that changes in the quantity of money affect the true value of goods , at least on the short term and modify the @xmath4 faced by agents , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "moreover we all complain about taxes , not only on income and capital , but also about so called vat , imposed on any transaction .",
    "we will not debate their value , but it is of interest to examine whether taxes influence the characteristics of very simple exchange markets .",
    "let us also , for the sake of perspective , refer to a few previous reports on the question of wealth and values within physics research work . models of prices are too numerous to be recalled here .",
    "models of values and wealth are sometimes quite elaborate . since we wish to devise a basic algorithm we only recall here below the following ones .",
    "pianegonda et al .",
    "@xcite in a series of papers introduced one dimensional models of wealth redistributions .",
    "it was of interest to compare things when the commercial links were frozen with the case in which the economical agents can choose their commercial partners at each time step .",
    "das and yarlagadda @xcite mathematically analyzed a simple market model where trading at each point in time involves only two agents with the sum of their money being conserved and with neither parties coming out with negative money after the interaction process .",
    "the exchange involved random re - distribution among the two players of a fixed fraction of their total money .",
    "chakraborti @xcite studied the distributions of money for different types of monetary transactions .",
    "he examined a model in which the agents invest equal amounts of money in each transaction .",
    "chatterjee @xcite studied the pareto law appearance in a kinetic model of market with random saving propensity , a pairwise exchange model using a slightly different exchange rule has been published by slanina @xcite .",
    "he also introduced the possibility of money entering or leaving at each exchange point .",
    "following the work by , patriarca , chakrabarti and kaski ( pck)@xcite , richmond et al . managed to solve their collision model analytically and showed that as formulated , it does not account for the observed data .",
    "the pareto exponent for the cpk exchange model is exactly one .",
    "values greater than 1 are not admitted by the model without introducing additional complexity such as memory , breaking the conservation of money during the exchange process or modifying the exchange rule as indeed was done by slanina .",
    "cpk and coworkers only did a numerical simulation and concluded that because they got a pareto exponent just above one ( they actually got 1.03 ) the model could account for the real data .",
    "the papers @xcite show au contraire , that it could not ! ! in fact , the generalised lotka volterra solution is well able to fit the real data . as a result",
    "it is believed that the cpk exchange model may be abandoned - or at least require serious modification .",
    "some economists also have strong philosophical objections to this particular exchange model .",
    "recently manolova et al .",
    "@xcite have studied an economy consisting of a finite number of agents located on a one - dimensional torus .",
    "each agent buys a set of goods from its nearest ( left ) neighbor , produces some other goods , sells goods to its nearest ( right ) neighbor and consumes the rest .",
    "thus , there are two opposite fluxes on the torus - goods and money .",
    "each agent attempts to maximize a risk aversion utility function of the expected produced and consumed quantities w.r.t .",
    "its production and exchange decision .",
    "information is local - each agent knows only the history of its own buy , sell , and production decisions .",
    "the individual agents plan over a revolving time horizon of two periods .",
    "thus , in each period , the agents must form anticipations about what will happen in the next period ( mean and variance ) , based on their past experiences .",
    "the authors investigated the transitory and permanent impact of local or global injections of money on the dynamics of exchanged quantities , prices , and individual welfare , and the mechanisms that explain this evolution .",
    "the distribution of wealth among the members of such a society is often assumed to result from one fundamental mechanism : trade .",
    "more sophisticated models assume two mechanisms , like trade and savings @xcite or trade and investment @xcite .",
    "others take into account good productions like in ref .",
    "@xcite : it was shown that the dynamics of exchange value in a system composed of many interacting agents exhibit cooperative emergence and collapse of global value for individual goods .",
    "several extensions have been proposed and published .",
    "it is still apparently unclear whether a more simple constraint leads to wealth redistribution , or to huge disparity in the society .",
    "it is of interest to use similar ideas , as those of previously quoted authors , considering agents as interacting randomly , e.g. around a table , still imposing a constant amount of money and yet a constant amount of goods , the exchange involving random re - distribution between two agents of a fraction of their total money and goods , with constraints to be defined in sect.2 .",
    "the goal of such a basic approach is thus to devise the most basic model of exchanges wealth redistribution under the most simple rules , and value definition , i.e. when there is no anticipation , nor utility ( like saving ) constraint . in section 3",
    ", we will outline the monte carlo steps done for implementing the model .",
    "we present a few results in sect.4 , - it will be seen that one can imagine a society made of two groups , the merchants , having goods ( and money ) , the bankers having money ( and goods ) .",
    "we end with conclusions in sect.5 .",
    "we present here a very simple model of goods and money flow . in the model",
    "we consider a constant number , @xmath5 , of agents , each possessing at the beginning the same amount of goods , called here apples , and money ( e.g. _ euro _ ) . at each step",
    "an agent is arbitrarily selected to look randomly for a partner from whom she may want to buy apples . with a 50 % probability the decision could be either _ yes , i want to buy _ , or _",
    "no , i do not want to buy_. the decision does not depend neither on previous decisions nor on any other factor .",
    "it is completely random .",
    "the details are explained in the algorithm given below .",
    "then it is determined randomly how many apples she would like to buy from such the partner , and how much money she is willing to pay .",
    "then the partner is checked whether she has enough apples and if so , whether she wants to sell . when both answers are positive , the transaction is made and the apples and money are appropriately transferred . in such a way",
    "there is no predetermined direction of neither flow .",
    "the total amount of money and goods are conserved throughout the process .",
    "the same is for the number of agents .",
    "even if somebody sold all her apples and run out of money , she still stays in the game , although rather as an observer , since she can neither buy nor sell .    when we agreed that , like in the manolova et al .",
    "paper @xcite , agents are pinpointed and the exchange is done only between nearest neighbors , we found that the dynamics stopped quickly , since if close to a rich agent there is a very poor one , no trading is possible .",
    "therefore in our model there is no fixed link among agents ( or spatial position ) and the underlying network of connections is a dynamical one .",
    "the algorithm is the following :    1",
    ".   chose randomly agent @xmath6 , 2 .",
    "check whether she has money and determine , with a 50 % probability ( flipping a coin ) , whether she wants to buy , 3 .",
    "determine how many apples ( from 1 to 5 , the maximum we allowed ) and for how much ( random fraction of the total amount of money she has ) , 4 .",
    "find , randomly , another agent @xmath7 , 5 .",
    "check whether she has enough apples to sell to the agent @xmath6 , 6 .   if so , determine whether she wants to sell , again by tossing a coin , 7 .",
    "when positive , pass the apples from @xmath7 to @xmath6 and money from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , 8 .",
    "when @xmath5 times the choice 1 has been made , one monte carlo step ( mcs ) has been completed .    during the simulation",
    "we have recorded the following quantities :    * amount of apples sold * amount of money transferred * number of transactions * maximum of apples possessed * maximum of money possessed * distribution of apples * distribution of money    in so doing we consider that the economy is bipolar : there are  more merchant - like agents \" , with their distribution and status characterized by the number of apples they own , and more banker - like agents characterized by the amount of money .",
    "of course , bankers have ( buy or sell ) apples and merchants own some money as well , beside having apples .",
    "we have performed our simulations with the following values of the parameters : the total number of agents @xmath5 = 60 , initial amount of money per agents ( the same for all ) = 50 ( `` eur '' ) , initial amount of apples , also 50 .",
    "the simulations were performed till 10000 mcs and the results averaged over 500 independent runs , which gave us quite good statistics .",
    "we have checked how robust the results are with respect to the changes in the size of the market , hence the number of agents , and the amount of goods ( apples ) and money attributed at the beginning to each agent .",
    "the time dependence of the maximum amount of apples and money is presented in figure [ maxima ] on a doubly logarithmic scale .",
    "it is seen that although asymptotically both curves are flat , the richest agent arrives at her maximum faster than her colleague having the maximum number of apples .",
    "this effect is most probably due to the fact that in order to slow down the dynamics we allowed at most 5 apples to be sold in a single transaction .",
    "on the other hand we did not put any limit on the price , which is restricted only by the amount of money in the pocket of the buying agent .",
    "although the price is randomly determined by the seller and also randomly accepted , or not , by the buyer , the fluctuations on the number of transactions per time , the number of exchanged apples and amount of money , show only little scatter and remain at approximately the same levels ( 11 , 11 , 35 respectively ) throughout the simulations .",
    "the distribution of wealth , shown in figure [ di - m - log ] , as well as the distribution of goods ( figure [ di - a - log ] ) show that the initial distributions peaked at the values 50 , spread quite fast and after some 1000 mcs there is already some amount of agents owing many apples and others becoming quite rich .",
    "it should be noted that the distributions are neither symmetric , nor are they similar one to another .",
    "the distribution of wealth shows many agents possessing below 20 `` eur '' and just a few ( the rich bankers ) having more than 140 .",
    "the distribution of apples is not so drastic , but again the majority of agents has below 20 apples ; there are few ( rich ) merchants .",
    "this asymmetry with respect to the wealth distribution is the results of our `` socialist '' restriction on the maximum of apples sold in one transaction .            this log - log plot ( fig .",
    "[ di - m - log ] ) recovers the findings of pareto for price distributions , @xcite i.e. , the ( money ) wealth variations seem to be described by a curve interpolating between two power - laws with some crossover .",
    "what can be pointed out is the relative stability of the crossover point , and the asymptotic nature of the power laws , respectively -0.5 and -2.0 at low and high ( money ) wealth . the ( good ) value distribution ( fig .",
    "[ di - a - log ] ) i s different from the ( money ) wealth , at low value , due to the type of market we impose .",
    "however a similar -2.0 asymptotic power law is found for the large amount of goods in possession of the ( rich in goods ) agents .",
    "we have been also interested how the results generated by our simple model change when we allow for a larger amount of agents .",
    "therefore we changed the number @xmath5 of agents to 20 and 100 .",
    "most interesting would be the time development of the maximum of apples and money , since for the average price and the distributions one would expect the same behavior , regardless of the size of the market . as could be seen from figures [ scal1 ] and [ scal2 ] , the curves , after appropriate scaling , are quite similar . in the figure [ scal1 ]",
    "the data for @xmath5 = 60 were divided by 1.22 and the data for @xmath5 by 1.32 , while in the figure [ scal2 ] the ratios were 1.42 and 1.60 , respectively .",
    "finally , we decided to check if our model is sensitive to some modifications , therefore we introduced taxes . at each transaction",
    "a certain amount of money paid goes not to the seller but to the `` state '' , hence disappears from the market , which is no longer closed , as far as money is concerned .",
    "notice that the ref.@xcite paper on the lotka volterra approach is also an exchange model where the so - called autocatalytic term allows the redistribution or extraction of money from all agents simultaneously . in this sense",
    "it can mimic a tax .",
    "for the present considerations we invented a flat tax rate of 1 % on the money which is exchanged .",
    "the amount of apples remains constant .",
    "the changes in the results are presented in figures [ maxima3 ] and [ price3 ] .",
    "the remaining characteristics , like the number of transactions , are the same as in the closed market . in the figures we present data for the case of @xmath5 = 60 agents , each having at the beginning 50 apples and 50 euros .",
    "as seen , the effect of taxes is not immediately felt , - as often !",
    "the maximum number of apples owned by the best merchants increases with time , - it accelerates when taxation is coming into play , on the richest agents , for levelling off , when the taxation effect is slowing down .",
    "figure [ distr - m - l - unl ] shows the effect of taxation on the distribution of wealth in the `` society '' .",
    "it is clear that taxation , which in our model reduces the amount of money circulating in the system , has similar effect like reducing the initial amount of money received by each agent .",
    "however this is not seen at the initial stages of the simulation and the distributions of wealth after , say 1000 mcs , show no essential differences between the case _ with taxes _ and _ no taxes_. after 10000 mcs there were no rich agents ( having more than 100 euros ) in the system with taxes and there were relatively many having just below 5 euros .",
    "we may therefore conclude that in the system with taxes the  difference  between the richest and the poorest agent is smaller than in the system without taxes , - quite natural indeed .",
    "also the average price per apple ( figure [ price3 ] ) goes down significantly .",
    "this however does not imply that in a system with taxes the agents are , on average , better off . as shown in figure [ distr - m - l - unl",
    "] , there are more poor agents in that case .",
    "it should be also noticed that in our simple model the tax money is dissipated , it simply disappears from the system , without being reintroduced into it in any way .",
    "the distributions of apples , even in the final stage , are quite similar in the two cases .",
    "we have presented a very simple model of a closed marked with free exchange of goods and wealth .",
    "the model contains just the following parameters : size of the market ( number of agents ) and the amount of goods and money owned initially by each agent .",
    "the role played in the dynamics by each of these factors has been investigated and discussed .",
    "the role of initial conditions has not been examined : e.g. we have also assumed an initially uniform distribution .",
    "we have imposed completely random rules , i.e. the amount of goods and the accepted price , as well as the trade decisions have no relation to trends , previous activity , anticipation , savings , etc .",
    "also partners for trading are chosen randomly among all agents .",
    "this is found to be very relevant in view of maintaining a dynamic economy .",
    "this does not require money or good injections as in manolova et al .",
    "@xcite , as often thought of  politically speaking  as well .",
    "of course , there is a catalytic effect , in imposing inflation , as qualitatively seen in comparing our results with theirs .",
    "such a free market stabilizes itself pretty soon ,  the average price , number of transactions , number of goods sold and money paid for them , become asymptotically fixed in time .",
    "in some sense there is an intrinsically generated (  self - organized  ) utility function .",
    "the distribution of money and goods shows a stratification of the `` society '' : there are poor and wealthy agents ; some have money , others own goods . this division is deeper in `` shallow '' markets , i.e. when there is less money and goods circulating .",
    "apart from that , many other characteristics of the market ( number of transactions , average price , etc ) have similar behavior and do not depend in a qualitative way on the size of the market .",
    "most of the results appear  quite natural  .",
    "considering characteristic exponents of power law tails for wealth distributions , there seems to be a trend away from pareto s values of 1.5 to slightly higher values .",
    "it can be wondered @xcite if this represents the impact of socialism since a higher slope value is associated with greater redistribution of money , as we found , whereas a low value of the pareto exponent suggests the rich really are rich and the poor are poor .",
    "notice that in the presently examined exchange market , one can be rich either because of owning money or because of having many apples .",
    "there is no king owning both .",
    "we have also considered the case when part of the money disappears from the market under the form of `` taxes '' , at each transaction .",
    "we have found that many characteristics are quite similar to the  no tax  case , but again the difference is mostly seen in the distribution of wealth , i.e. , the poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer . most of the results appear  quite natural  .",
    "notice also that recent studies of uk data show that the pareto exponent associated with the medium to high income range has over the decade 1992 -2002 decreased from 3.3 to 2.7 . during this period taxation",
    "has increased@xcite .",
    "it can be wondered @xcite if this represents the impact of socialism since a higher slope value is associated with greater redistribution of money , whereas a low value of the pareto exponent suggests the rich really are rich and the poor are poor .",
    "we are aware that in our simple model we have much reduced macro and micro economy conditions and therefore further modifications of our model may be needed .",
    "this however will reduce the simplicity and transparency of the present model ( _ ockham razor _ ) .    in future work",
    ", it could be useful to discuss the  differences  between classical and neoclassical theories of _ price / apple _ and _ value / money_. the relevance of trade transactions in which the prices differ in time depending on the quantity of values / prices ( or money / goods ) to be exchanged at a given time through ( several ) interacting agents , as in real economic societies should be examined .",
    "the relationship between trading volume and the prices of both financial assets and commodities is also of significant relevance to economists , traders and politicians .",
