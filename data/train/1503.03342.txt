    "microcavity polaritons , the novel quasiparticles resulting from the coherent strong coupling between quantum well excitons and cavity photons  @xcite , have unique mixed matter - light properties that none of their constituents displays on its own . because of their energy dispersion and their strong non - linearity inherited from the excitonic components",
    ", polaritons continuously injected by an external laser into a pump state with suitable wavevector and energy can undergo coherent stimulated scattering into two conjugate states  @xcite , the signal and the idler , a process known as optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) . since their first realisation  @xcite",
    ", the interest in microcavity optical parametric phenomena has involved several fields of fundamental and applicative research  @xcite .",
    "recently , considerable resources have been invested in exploring the fundamental properties of parametric processes , including the possibility of macroscopic phase coherence and superfluid behaviour  @xcite . in spite of the coherent nature of the driving laser pump",
    ", the opo process belongs to the class of non - equilibrium phase transitions , in which a @xmath1 phase symmetry is spontaneously broken  @xcite .",
    "while the phase of the pumped mode is locked to the incident laser , the ones of signal and idler are free to be simultaneously rotated in opposite directions . because of this phase freedom , recent experiments  @xcite have tested the opo superfluid properties by exploring the physics of the signal - idler order parameter , demonstrating the existence and metastability of vortex configurations . as the order parameter involves both signal and idler , their phase winding have opposite signs  @xcite .",
    "crucially , this makes both opo fluids to display quantized flow metastability simultaneously .    while in equilibrium condensates",
    "different aspects of superfluidity are typically closely related  @xcite , this is no longer true in a non - equilibrium context as for microcavity polaritons  @xcite . in particular , those aspects of superfluidity related to the frictionless flow around defects are expected to be much more involved in opo condensates than for any other investigated polariton condensates , such as for the case of incoherent pumping  @xcite , and single - state resonantly pumped microcavities  @xcite . independently on the pumping scheme , the driving and the polariton finite lifetime prompt questions about the meaning of superfluid behaviour , when the spectrum of collective excitations is complex rather than real , raising conceptual interrogatives about the applicability of a landau criterion  @xcite . yet , an additional complexity characterises the opo regime , where the simultaneous presence of three oscillation frequencies and momenta for pump , signal and idler correspondingly multiplies the number of collective excitation branches  @xcite . note that from the experimental point of view , pioneering experiments  @xcite have observed a ballistic non - spreading propagation of signal / idler polariton wavepackets in a triggered - opo configuration .",
    "however , given the complexity of the dynamics as well as the nonlinear interactions involved in this time - dependent configuration  @xcite , theoretical understanding of these observations is not complete yet .",
    "this article reports a joint theoretical and experimental study of an opo configuration where a wide and steady - state condensate hits a stationary localised defect in the microcavity .",
    "contrary to the criterion for quantized flow metastability for which signal and idler display simultaneous locked responses , we find that their scattering properties when the opo hits a static defect are different .",
    "in particular we investigate the scattering properties of all three fluids , pump , signal and idler , in both real and momentum space .",
    "we find that the modulations generated by the defect in each fluid are determined not only by its associated rayleigh scattering ring , but each component displays additional rings because of the cross - talk with the other components imposed by nonlinear and parametric processes .",
    "we single out three factors determining which one of these rings influences the most each fluid response : the coupling strength between the three opo states , the resonance of the ring with the blue - shifted lower polariton dispersion , the values of each fluid group velocity and lifetime together establishing how far each modulation can propagate from the defect .",
    "the concurrence of these effects implies that the idler strongly scatters inheriting the same modulations as the pump , while the modulations due to its own ring can propagate only very close to the defect and can not be appreciated . yet",
    ", the modulations in the signal are strongly suppressed , and not at all visible in experiments , because the slope of the polariton dispersion in its low momentum component brings all rayleigh rings coming from pump and idler out of resonance .",
    "note that the kinematic conditions for opo are incompatible with the pump and idler being in the subsonic regime .",
    "thus , the coupling between the three components always implies some degree of scattering in the signal . in practice",

    ", we apply a gaussian filter to the real space images ( see inset of the left top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ereal ] ) . as explained in more details in  @xcite , gaussian filtering consists of subtracting from the original data a copy which has been convoluted with a gaussian kernel , thus getting rid of the long - wavelength modulations .",
    "this procedure reveals that indeed the pump imprints its modulation also into the signal , even though these are extremely weak , thus leaving the signal basically insensitive to the presence of the defect .",
    "pump and idler states are each mostly resonant with their own rings , i.e. , @xmath96 at @xmath30 and @xmath97 at @xmath98 , respectively .",
    "thus one should then observe two superimposed modulations in both pump and idler filtered emissions , the stronger one for each being the most resonant one .",
    "however , the modulations associated to the idler only propagate very close to the defect , at an average distance @xmath99 m before getting damped , and thus are not clearly visible . for the opo conditions considered ,",
    "this is due to the small idler group velocity @xmath100 , as the dispersion is almost excitonic at the idler energy .",
    "we can conclude that , for the typical opo condition with a signal at @xmath12 , considered in figs .",
    "[ fig : spect ] and  [ fig : ereal ] , the signal fluid does not show modulations and the extremely weak scattering inherited from the pump state can be appreciated only after a gaussian filtering procedure of the image .",

    "the agreement between the results obtained experimentally and within the linear response approximation is additionally confirmed by an exact full numerical analysis of the coupled equations   for a finite size pump via a 5@xmath121-order adaptive - step runge - kutta algorithm .",
