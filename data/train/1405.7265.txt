    "electron diffraction patterns exhibiting octagonal , decagonal , dodecagonal , and icosahedral point symmetry are found in various alloys .",
    "the most well - known pattern is the icosahedral phase in @xmath3-@xmath4 alloys , which is observed when these materials are cooled at a rapid rate such that their constituent atoms do not have adequate time to form a crystal lattice .",
    "these structures are referred to as quasicrystals  @xcite . in principle , quasicrystals are characterized as atomic structures that present long - range quasiperiodic translational and long - range orientational order .",
    "they can exhibit rotational symmetries otherwise forbidden to crystals . in the last decade , quasicrystals have attracted significant attention , mostly because of their stronger magnetic properties and enhanced elasticity at higher temperatures , compared with the traditional crystals .    a most intriguing research topic about quasicrystals is to determine whether its intrinsic complicated structure can result in a change of the universality class compared with its counterpart periodic structure . to this end , potts model  @xcite offers a simple and feasible way to study quasicrystals from this perspective , as it contains both first- and second - order phase transitions .",
    "however , given the lack of periodicity of these quasiperiodic lattices , only numerical approaches can be performed .",
    "previous monte carlo studies on the ferromagnetic potts model for quasiperiodic lattices  @xcite have revealed that both the systems belong to the same universality class , despite the critical temperature of the quasiperiodic lattices being higher than that of the square lattices .",
    "however , given the great variety of existing quasiperiodic lattices , this query has not been solved completely . consequently , this necessitates extensive computational research for accurately estimating the static critical exponents in these lattices . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "studies concerning the @xmath2 potts model on quasiperiodic lattices have been rarely reported in the literature .",
    "the present study investigates the critical behavior of the ferromagnetic @xmath5-potts model on quasiperiodic decagonal lattices ( qdl ) to accurately estimate the infinite qdl critical temperature and critical exponents for each case .",
    "an interesting example of a natural structure which presents a decagonal symmetry is the @xmath6 quasicrystal found in the khatyrka meteorite  @xcite .",
    "the quasiperiodic lattices analyzed in this study were generated using the strip projection method  @xcite with spins placed in the vertices of the rhombi that constitute the qdl ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were applied on these lattices to avoid the boundary effects caused by the finite size .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : proc ] briefly describes the strip projection method adopted for generating the qdl and periodic boundary conditions used in the simulations . details of the potts model and monte carlo simulation approach are described in section [ sec : mms ] . in section [ sec : f ] , a succinct description of the finite - size scaling ( fss ) relations used in the study is presented . in section [ sec : r ] , we present the results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 potts model and compare them with previous results on quasi - periodic lattices . in section [ sec : c ] , we conclude by summarizing the results and providing recommendations for further research .    a periodic approximation of the qdl generates by the strip projection method .",

    "the strip projection method is a powerful technique for constructing periodic and non - periodic lattices .",
    "the methodology can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , starting from a regular lattice @xmath21 whose unit cell , @xmath22 , is spanned by the @xmath23 vectors @xmath24 , we can resolve @xmath25 into two mutually orthogonal subspaces , namely , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , of dimensions @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "second , we define a `` strip '' @xmath31 as a set of all the points whose positions are obtained by adding any vector in @xmath26 to any vector in @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "the required lattice , @xmath33 , is the projection in @xmath26 of all the points in @xmath34 that are included in the strip , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "the requirement that any point @xmath36 lies in the strip is equivalent to the condition that the projection of @xmath37 in @xmath27 lies within the projection of @xmath22 in @xmath27 .",
    "this equivalence can be mathematically expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , accordingly , the lattice can be defined as follows : @xmath41 one way to describe the projection of the points @xmath42 given by @xmath43 ( where the @xmath44 s are integers ) onto @xmath26 and @xmath27 is to choose an orthogonal basis @xmath45 in @xmath26 and an orthogonal basis @xmath46 in @xmath27 .",
    "together they form a new basis @xmath47 of @xmath25 . assuming @xmath48 , the relationship between the two basis can be given by a rigid rotational operation . by defining a rotation matrix @xmath49 , it is possible to determine the projection matrices using the following equations @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "the rotation matrix @xmath49 can be split into an @xmath52 submatrix @xmath53 and @xmath54 submatrix @xmath55 : @xmath56 to generate the decagonal quasiperiodic lattice , the points in the finite region of a 5d hypercubic lattice ( @xmath57 ) are projected onto an 2d subspace ( @xmath26 ) only if these points are projected inside a rhombic icosahedron , which in this case is the `` strip '' .",
    "the resulting quasiperiodic lattice is obtained through the standard rotation matrix : @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the decagonal quasiperiodic lattice consists of two types of building blocks , usually represented by a fat rhombus with an acute angle of @xmath61 and a thin rhombus with an acute angle of @xmath62 , arranged according to specific matching rules .",
    "however , the quasiperiodic lattices are not suitable for monte carlo simulation with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "a more suitable approach is to construct a periodic approximation of these lattices .",
    "this can be realized by simply replacing the golden number @xmath63 in the sub - matrix @xmath55 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) by a rational number @xmath64 , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are successive terms in the fibonacci sequence @xmath67 fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the periodic approximation of the qdl inside a square projection window .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are imposed at lattice sites closer to the square projection window . for finite lattices , the number of nearest neighbors at a given site range from @xmath68 to @xmath69 with a mean coordination number equal to @xmath70 .",
    "the mean coordination number is expected to be lower than @xmath71 , given the existence of a small fraction ( @xmath72 1.0% ) of sites on the boundary with a coordination number lower than @xmath68 in the finite lattices is analyzed in this study .",
    "to study the critical behavior in the qdl , we updated our lattices using the wolff algorithm  @xcite . for a fixed temperature , we define a monte carlo step ( mcs ) per spin by accumulating the flip times of all the spins and then dividing them by the total spin number .",
    "the hamiltonian of the _ q_-states ferromagnetic potts model ( @xmath73 ) can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the kronecker delta function , and the sum runs over all nearest neighbors of @xmath76 .",
