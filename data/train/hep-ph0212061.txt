    "in order to interpret data on nuclear collisions from current experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and future experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , it is necessary to have knowledge of the _ initial conditions_. there are large uncertainties in the estimates of the initial produced gluon density , @xmath3 in central @xmath4 at @xmath5  agev and @xmath6 in central @xmath7 reactions at @xmath8  agev , since widely different models ( e.g. see @xcite ) seem to be roughly consistent with data  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , essential to check the energy dependence of the density of the produced quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) with observables complementary to the particle multiplicity @xmath9 and transverse energy @xmath10 per unit rapidity .",
    "observables are ideally suited for this task because they provide an estimate  @xcite of the energy loss , @xmath11 , of fast partons , resulting from medium induced non - abelian radiation along their path , as first discussed in  @xcite in the context of relativistic heavy ion reactions .",
    "the approximate linear dependence of @xmath11 on @xmath12 is the key that enables high-@xmath0 observables to convey information about the initial conditions .",

    "the idea is to exploit the spatial azimuthal asymmetry of non - central nuclear collisions .",

    "while this approach is discussed in more detail below , it is important to emphasize here that at the single inclusive jet ( or hadron ) level the resulting high-@xmath0 azimuthal asymmetry is also perfectly coupled to the reaction plane .",
    "it has been suggested that in the limit of very large energy loss the momentum asymmetry is driven by jet production from the boundary of the interaction volume  @xcite .",
    "recently , a classical computation of the elliptic flow at transverse momenta @xmath26 in the framework of _ gluon saturation _ models has been performed  @xcite .",
