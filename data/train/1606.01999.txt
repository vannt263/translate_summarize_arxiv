    "quantum transport through topological insulators and superconductors has received a large amount of attention in condensed matter physics over the past few years @xcite .",
    "one of the most influential discoveries is that topological phases supporting majorana fermions can be realized and engineered in the heterostructures based on s - wave superconductors and materials with strong spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "the search for majorana bound states ( mbss ) is motivated in part by their non - abelian characteristics and potential application in fault - tolerant quantum computations @xcite .",
    "it was predicted that the signature of the mbss may exhibit as a zero bias conductance peak in the normal metal / topological superconductor junctions , as has been observed in hybrid devices of superconductor and semiconductor nanowire @xcite and in ferromagnetic iron atomic chains on the surface of superconducting lead @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , an unambiguous experimental verification remains elusive because zero - bias peaks can also have non - majorana origins , such as the kondo effect or disorder effect @xcite .",
    "the signal of current noise cross correlation could provide an alternative , even confirmative proof , to verify the existence of mbss . in non - majorana devices",
    ", it has been demonstrated experimentally that cooper pairs can split into spin - entangled electrons flowing in two spatially separated normal metals , resulting in a positive current - current correlation @xcite .",
    "although many theoretical studies have been devoted to investigate the property of the noise cross correlation induced by mbss @xcite , the majorana - modulated nonlocal transport signal has not been reported experimentally up to now .",
    "one of the possible reasons is that the energy splitting of mbss , which is essential to induce the noise cross correlation , is usually weak .",
    "the majorana energy splitting is at most tens of @xmath0ev in a topological nanowire with a length of @xmath1 m @xcite , and it approaches zero near the critical zeeman field between the trivial and topological phases @xcite . compared to the majorana energy splitting , other energy scales , such as the intra- and inter - dot coulomb interaction and superconducting pairing energy , are much stronger .",
    "for instance , a typical value of the inter - dot coulomb interaction is of the order of @xmath2mev @xcite , and the pairing energy of a cooper pair is of the order of @xmath2ev .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to produce robust current - current correlations by combining the nonlocality of majorana fermions and other robust physical mechanisms .    recently , quantum transport properties modulated by coulomb interactions in majorana devices have attracted much attention @xcite . in an interacting transistor coupled to mbss",
    ", it is found that the conductance shows coulomb oscillations with universal halving of the finite temperature peak under strong blockade conditions @xcite .",
    "altland and egger studied multiple helical nanowires in proximity to a common mesoscopic superconducting island with a finite charging energy @xcite .",
    "the mbss prepared in a superconducting island with coulomb interactions are suggested to realize the topological kondo effect @xcite .",
    "bri and cooper studied the simplest case with three leads coupled to two pairs of majorana fermions with a charging energy @xcite .",
    "the superconducting coulomb island supporting mbss offers a new playground to generate nonlocal current - current correlations in the absence of a finite majorana energy splitting .",
    "however , since the large global charging energy is itself a strong nonlocal perturbation , it becomes troublesome whether the measured nonlocal current correlations are essentially generated by the charging energy or mbss .",
    "it has been pointed out that poissonian shot noises are generically obtained by mbss in a floating topological superconductor in the absence of charging energy @xcite .",
    "however , it does not provide a unique signature to confirm the existence of mbss .",
    "although the coulomb - modulated conductance properties in majorana devices have been well studied , it remains unknown how coulomb interaction affects the nonlocal current noise cross correlations in majorana systems .",
    "( see main text ) is proportional to a gate voltage @xmath3 that controls the average charge on the sc island .",
    "the leads are biased with the chemical potential @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "crossed andreev reflections can be induced by correlating the currents that flow into the topological nanowire via the mbss .",

    "the purpose to insert the quantum dots is to offer an efficient way to modulate the nonlocal current correlations without affecting the property of the mbss .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model hamiltonian of the majorana - dot device fabricated on a superconducting coulomb island , as well as the current and noise cross correlation formulas . in sec .",
    "iii , we investigate the nonlocal transport properties modulated by the charging energy in the island .",
    "we consider the cases that the superconducting island is floating and connected to a bulk superconductor , respectively . for comparison , the current noise cross correlation property in the absence of mbss ,",
    "is also discussed .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "a schematic of the coulomb - majorana junction is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . we consider a semiconductor nanowire proximity - coupled to a mesoscopic superconducting island with a finite charging energy , and there exists a pair of mbss at the wire ends under a proper magnetic field @xcite .",
    "each end of the nanowire connects to a normal metal electrode via a quantum dot .",
    "the intraisland coulomb interactions introduce correlations between the two mbss , and thereby generate the cross correlation between the currents flowing through the two quantum dots .",
    "it is convenient to define nonlocal auxiliary fermion operators @xmath6 , @xmath7 for the mbss , with the number operator @xmath8 . in the regular fermionic representation",
    ", the instantaneous charged state of the superconducting island is described by ( @xmath9 ) , where the integer @xmath10 represents the cooper pair number in the island and @xmath11 is the eigenvalue of @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath13 the nanowire is in the topological superconducting state and isolated mbss appear at the wire ends .",
    "including the majorana energy splitting and a coulomb charging term , the island hamiltonian is fully expressed by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the majorana energy splitting and the capacitive charging effect is denoted by @xmath16 and can be tuned by a gate voltage parameter @xmath17 .",
    "experimentally , the charging energy in a superconducting island can reach at about @xmath18ev @xcite .",
    "next , the two quantum dots in fig .",
    "1 are assumed to be in the coulomb blockade regime such that each dot can be modeled as a single fermion level .",
    "the energy level in each dot can be tuned by gate voltages , and the spin degeneracy on the dots also breaks by the zeeman field which induces the topological superconducting phase of the wire . as a consequence",
    ", we can use the effectively spinless fermion operators @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) for the dots @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantum dots reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the dot energy level and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) represents the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator on dot @xmath23 .",
    "different from the noninteracting case in which @xmath24 , there exists an energy cost when absorbing or emitting a cooper pair in the superconducting island . to ensure the charge conservation ,",
    "it is essential to add a factor @xmath25 in the tunneling terms @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , which changes the cooper pair number @xmath10 by one unit and thus restores the charge balance .",
    "the hamiltonian of the majorana - dot tunneling then reads @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the dot - majorana coupling strength and the operator @xmath30 raises ( lowers ) the cooper pair number by one unit , i.e. , @xmath31 . in conjunction with spin - orbit coupling and the zeeman splitting , the nanowire in the topological phase resembles an effective @xmath32-wave superconductor .",
    "therefore , the cooper pair exchange with the bulk superconductor involves the spin - flip scattering processes .",
    "the spin properties of the topological nanowire as well as spin - flip processes in the contact can be fully taken into account via the tunnel couplings @xmath29 and @xmath33 , where @xmath33 denotes the cooper pair exchange strength between the nanowire and the bulk superconductor .",
    "the tunnel couplings capture the possible spin dependence of microscopic transition amplitudes and can be taken as real - valued positive @xcite .",
    "we include the cooper pair exchange between the superconducting island and another bulk superconductor , @xmath34 with the josephson coupling @xmath33 .",
    "finally , the electrodes and the dot - electrode tunneling are described by the hamiltonians @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator in the lead @xmath23 with an energy @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the lead - dot coupling strength .",
    "the current noise cross correlation has been well studied in a dot - majorana - dot structure when the majorana nanowire is directly in proximity with a bulk superconductor @xcite . in this case , a finite majorana energy splitting is essential to generate nonlocal correlations .",
    "in contrast , here the cross correlations could be controlled by the charging energy of the superconducting island as well as the majorana energy splitting .",
    "if we consider a one - dimensional tight - binding kitaev model @xcite , the two quantum dots look like two extended sites of the kitaev model . in this sense , the majorana zero modes will be located near the interface between the nanowire and the quantum dots , where the tail part of the wave function of the zero modes could enter the quantum dots . differently , the dot energy levels could be tunable by applying gate voltages .",
    "if the dot energy levels are tuned to be high enough , the wave function of majorana mode will appear hardly at the quantum dots .",
    "we exploit the diagonalized master equation ( dme ) approach to investigate the electronic transport through this system in the sequential tunneling regime @xcite . in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", the applicability of the dme approach has been discussed in the majorana devices , by comparing with the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method .",
    "it is shown that the dme works well in most regimes of system parameters , while it breaks down for strong central region - lead coupling or when energy degeneracies appear .",
    "here we extend our discussion to the interacting case .",
    "compared to the negf method , the dme approach is convenient in dealing with many interacting energy levels , and there is strong coherence between different levels .    in the dme approach ,",
    "we firstly diagonalize the hamiltonian of the island - dot part and obtain the eigenvalues @xmath40 and their corresponding eigenfunctions @xmath41 .",

    "in the following , we present numerical results for the sequential tunneling currents and their correlations in the presence of the charging energy on the superconducting island in the nonlinear response regime .",
    "the negative noise cross correlation is related to the antibunching between tunneling events , which arises as a result of the pauli exclusive principle of scattered electrons , while the positive cross correlation is usually related to the bunching of tunneling processes , e.g. , due to the interchannel coulomb blockade or crossed andreev reflection @xcite . in the calculation",

    "the transport channels through all eigen energy levels are open and the competition between different tunneling paths leads to the positive @xmath134 in all regions . in this case ,",
    "the cross correlation @xmath134 in the region of antisymmetric level configuration ( @xmath88 ) is much stronger than those in other regions . when the coupling strength @xmath33 is comparable to the charging energy @xmath16 , the enhanced current cross correlations appear in the large @xmath130 limit , as a result of the dynamical coulomb blockade effect .",
    "when @xmath33 is strong enough , all the cooper pair number states @xmath114 are well mixed , which suppresses the coulomb blockade effect .",

    "now we turn to investigate the effect of a finite majorana energy splitting . in the noninteracting case and at small voltages , previous studies @xcite have shown that a finite majorana energy splitting induces a four - peak cloverlike pattern of cross correlation with two positive parts ( for @xmath157 ) and two negative parts ( for @xmath158 ) when tuning the two dot energy levels .",
    "figure 8 shows the current noise cross correlation @xmath134 as a function of dot energy levels for the case of symmetric ( @xmath87 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath87 ) level configurations of two dots at small lead voltages .",

    "it consists of a superconductor island coupled to two quantum dots , and each dot is connected to a normal metallic electrode . in the case that the pairing strength in the superconducting island is much stronger than other system parameters , the quasiparticles in the superconductor are inaccessible , and one can trace out of the degrees of freedom of the superconducting island without inducing any dissipative dynamics .",
    "an effective hamiltonian to describe the dynamics of the double dots could be obtained by performing a real - time perturbative expansion @xcite . in the limit of an infinite intradot coulomb interaction , the effective model hamiltonian of the dots - superconducting island part",
    "is given by @xmath161 here @xmath162 is the effective pairing strength between the quantum dots , and it is determined by the coupling strength between the superconducting island and quantum dots .",
    "the pairing terms in @xmath163 describe the formation of nonlocal superconducting correlations between the two dots induced by the splitting of cooper pairs into the two dots .     as functions of dot energy level @xmath145 and @xmath146 for ( a ) @xmath139 and ( b ) @xmath143 in the absence of the mbss .",

    "it should be noted that this device can still host mbs on each dot if the electron tunneling processes between two dots are considered @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , an inhomogeneous magnetic field is considered to make two dots fully spin - polarized , but in different directions with an angle @xmath165 .",
    "the amplitude for tunneling between the dots therefore depends on the angle @xmath165 as @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the tunneling amplitude for parallel fields .",
    "similarly , the effective pairing @xmath162 also depends on the angle and is given by @xmath168 , where @xmath169 is the pairing strength between two dots for antiparallel spin polarizations . in the case of @xmath170 and",
    "either @xmath145 or @xmath146 being equal to zero , zero energy solutions of mbss could be obtained @xcite . when the superconducting gap is much larger than other energy scales , electrons tunneling between two dots via the superconductor",
    "will be strongly suppressed .",
    "therefore , the validation of the non - majorana setup we considered is that the processes of electrons tunneling between two dots via the superconductor are rather weak , i.e. , @xmath171 .    in the absence of mbss , there are no other low - energy quasiparticle states in the superconducting island and electrons tunnel from the quantum dots into the island in pairs . in the limit of infinitely strong coulomb interaction in the quantum dots ,",
    "the currents are dominated by the crossed andreev reflection .",
    "only a positive current cross correlation could be generated and the sign of the cross correlation is independent of the dot energy levels and the charging energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig-10 ] the current noise cross correlation is plotted as a function of dot energy levels in the absence of mbss .",
    "only a positive cross correlation exists for the non - majorana device .",
    "this is quite different from the results in the presence of mbss . in figs .",
    "[ fig-6]-[fig-8 ] , only a negative cross correlation is generated at low lead chemical potentials .",
    "therefore , we can check the existence of mbss from the sign of the current noise cross correlation at the small lead chemical potentials .",
    "we have assumed that the on - site coulomb interaction in the two dots is so strong that only one electron is allowed to stay in the dot at one time . in this case , the direct andreev reflection processes are suppressed .",
    "finally we briefly discuss the effect of the direct andreev reflection processes on the current noise cross correlation .",
    "if the two dots are connected to a bulk superconductor , the crossed andreev reflection induces positive cross correlation , while the direct andreev reflection processes do not contribute to the cross correlation .",
    "however , if the two dots are coupled to a superconducting island with a finite charging energy , the direct andreev reflection processes through one dot will compete with the tunneling in another dot to lower the energy in the island . in this case",
    ", it is expected that a negative cross correlation is induced .",
    "in conclusion , we investigate the currents and their noise cross correlations modulated by a global charging energy in a hybrid device of mbss and quantum dots .",
    "the mbss are created in a semiconductor nanowire in proximity to a mesoscopic superconducting island .",
    "each end of the nanowire is weakly connected to a quantum dot and a normal metal lead .",
    "this configuration is motivated by the possibility to switch the sign of current noise cross correlation by varying the dot energy levels .",
    "we have studied two cases : the superconducting island is floating , and the island is connected to another bulk superconductor .",
    "the floating island case shows a negative differential conductance and a giant super - poissonian shot noise , resulting from the interplay of the nonlocality of the mbss and dynamical coulomb blockade .",
    "when the superconducting island is coupled to the bulk superconductor , we show that the current noise cross correlation is always negative as a function of dot energy levels at low lead chemical potentials .",
    "in contrast , the current cross correlation is always positive in a non - majorana setup . for current cross correlations induced by the energy splitting of mbss",
    ", a four - peak cloverlike pattern of the noise cross correlation appears when tuning the dot energy levels .",
    "however , the pattern becomes more complex in the presence of a charging energy on the superconducting island . with the increase of lead chemical potentials ,",
    "the cross correlation becomes positive gradually for the antisymmetric configuration of the dot energy levels .",
    "when the coupling strength between the island and the bulk superconductor is comparable to the charging energy , the noise cross correlation is strongly enhanced in the antisymmetric level configuration .",
