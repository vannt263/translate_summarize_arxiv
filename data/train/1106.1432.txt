    "recently , @xcite made a deep image at 1.4 ghz with the westerbork array ( wsrt ) and detected mm18423 + 5938 at a position consistent with ours to within @xmath114 .",
    "they used the radio - fir relation to infer an apparent luminosity @xmath115 consistent with our new estimate .",
    "the velocity - integrated co(1 - 0 ) flux density yields a luminosity @xmath116  k km s@xmath8 pc@xmath9 using the relationships from @xcite . if corrected by @xmath11 , this is the typical luminosity found for smgs , _",

    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "the gas - to - dynamical mass ratio exceeds unity for the dynamical mass ( @xmath121 m@xmath119 ) computed for an hypothetical edge - on disk by using the fwhm of the lines ( @xmath122 km / s ) as an indication of the rotation velocity .",
    "this exceedingly large ratio and the fact that a disk in mm18423 + 5938 is not expected to be supported by the radiation pressure of an agn @xcite suggest that a disk would be inclined .",
    "note that this ratio still exceeds unity if a merger model is used instead , the enclosed dynamical mass is approximately a factor of 2 larger in this case @xcite . in fig  [ evla ] , the second component in the co(1 - 0 ) and co(2 - 1 ) lines detected at a low significance level",
    "is blueshifted by  200 - 300 km s@xmath8 .",
    "we have verified that this component is not visible in the averaged profile of the three high order ( j=4,6,7 ) co lines observed at the iram 30 m @xcite , which indicates there are distinct co components that have low excitation only within mm18423 + 5938 .",
    "such a component would be indicative of either a more extended low order co component of the rotating disk or possibly the second component of a merger .",
    "the high order co excitation ladder observed with emir / iram was fitted with a large velocity gradient ( lvg radiative transfer model , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) ) in lestrade et al .",
    "the co(1 - 0 ) peak flux density ( @xmath126 mjy ) is consistent with this model , while the co(2 - 1 ) measurement ( @xmath127 mjy ) is marginally in excess by @xmath128 when the 20% calibration uncertainty at 47  ghz is included .",
    "although this uncertainty is presently large , we note that the ratio of the flux densities co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) is difficult to explain even with differential lensing if the excitation is spatially variable in the galaxy , unless co(1 - 0 ) is moderately optically thick , with rising optical depth toward co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "new evla observations are required to investigate this in more detail .",
    "the peak rest - frame brightness temperature of the ring is 12 k ( east clump in our map of fig  [ evla ] ) .",
    "this is similar to what has been seen in other @xmath129  smgs , such as gn20 @xcite , although we can not rule - out higher @xmath130 clumps that are not resolved by our present observations .",
    "while there is a long history of co observations from strongly lensed , high redshift galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mm18423 + 5938 is only the second complete einstein ring seen in co emission , after the z=4.1 quasar host galaxy pss j2322 + 1944 @xcite .",
    "we identified the lens and derived a magnification factor of @xmath131 using a preliminary lensing model .",
    "we measured a luminosity @xmath5 , and corresponding @xmath132 mass , for mm18423 + 5938 that , when corrected for magnification , are similar to the unlensed smgs .",
    "however , the relatively large range for @xmath103 in our present analysis requires further observations to better sample the fir sed in order to better constrain the implied star formation rate .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite for the molecular einstein ring observed towards the qso pss j2322 + 1944 , the brighter smg mm18423 + 5938 provides a unique opportunity to study the gas dynamics on physical scale as small as @xmath133 pc with further high sensitivity and high spatial resolution evla observations .",
