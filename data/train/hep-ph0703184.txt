    "discrete charge - parity ( cp ) symmetry violation is an interesting and puzzling phenomenon within the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "while the sm has been successful in explaining all of the available experimental data , it fails to provide an explanation for the breaking of cp .",
    "insight into understanding its nature and structure would shed light on diverse issues ranging from the origin of the mass to the evolution of our universe .",
    "the sm presents an economical scenario for cp violation , described through only one weak phase in cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "even though the observed direct cp violation in k @xcite and b @xcite decays can be accommodated via the ckm matrix of the sm , this is not true for other phenomena , such as the matter - antimatter asymmetry present in the universe .",
    "in addition , the standard model fails to explain the origin of cp violation but merely parameterizes it .",
    "thus the sm framework could be viewed as a low energy effective version of a more complete theory , and cp violation offers a motivation to go beyond the sm . in the models beyond the sm",
    ", the existence of new sources of cp violation other than the ckm phase , resolves some of the problems of the sm , but not all .",
    "one of the leading candidates of physics beyond the sm is supersymmetry , in particular the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "supersymmetry provides a compelling argument for the stabilization of the higgs sector against quadratic divergencies and allows unification of gauge couplings at high energies , both unexplained by the sm . in the mssm ,",
    "enough baryon asymmetry can be generated at the electroweak scale at any temperature by means of the existence of an additional higgs doublet .",
    "however , the mssm has difficulty reconciling the smallness of the electric dipole moments with expectations of scalar fermion masses and the size of new cp violating phases introduced by soft supersymmetry breaking @xcite .    in mssm , there are many parameters which can in principle be complex , even after making all allowed rotations to get rid of unphysical phases .",
    "this raises the interesting possibility that cp violation , or cp asymmetries , might arise in other sectors of the model than the quark sector , and that would provide a spectacular signal of physics beyond the standard model . in particular , it is possible that there might be a close relationship between the higgs sector and cp violation .",
    "the structure and properties of the higgs sector are under intense scrutiny at present .",
    "though indications at lep for a light higgs boson of mass around 115 gev are encouraging , they await confirmation .",
    "searching for higgs bosons is one of the major objectives of present and future high energy experiments .",
    "in particular , a charged higgs boson , predicted by most models to have mass of the order of the weak scale , would be a definite sign for physics beyond the sm .",
    "the phenomenology of charged higgs bosons is less model dependent than that of neutral higgs bosons , and it is governed by the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 . because charged higgs couplings are proportional to fermion masses , the decays to third generation quarks and leptons are dominant . at hadron colliders , such as the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) ,",
    "a light charged higgs boson can be produced from the decay of top quark via @xmath8 , if @xmath9 .",
    "if the charged higgs boson is heavier than the top quark , there are three channels for producing charged higgs pairs : @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; as well as the single charged higgs production @xmath12 ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in many cases complementary information from more than one channel will be accessible at the lhc .",
    "the lhc has a high potential for detecting heavy higgs states which might be beyond the kinematic reach of the planned international linear collider ( ilc ) . at the ilc ,",
    "the main production mechanism for charged higgs bosons would be @xmath13 , followed by one of the allowed decays @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the pair production cross section for charged higgs at ilc is about 2.5 larger than for the neutral ones @xcite . provided that a higgs boson couples to the z boson",
    ", the ilc will observe it independently of its decay characteristics .",
    "the discovery potential is practically independent of @xmath6 and extends up to 1.2 tev for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb@xmath16@xcite . for specific examples of how the integrated information obtained by ilc and lhc can be used for higgs detection and determination of parameters in the higgs sector ,",
    "see @xcite .    in its most general form ,",
    "the mssm predicts a plethora of new cp phases .",
    "these new sources of flavor and cp violation give rise to the enhancement of cp violation effects alluded to before , which could provide distinguishing signs for mssm at present and future colliders . in this study",
    ", we concentrate on analysis of the cp asymmetry in charged higgs decays @xmath17 in the framework of the mssm . here",
    "the corresponding neutral higgs cp asymmetry in @xmath19 has been discussed in ref .",
    "the cp asymmetry in the main decay mode @xmath20 and other two - body non - quark charged higgs decays have been considered in @xcite .",
    "recently , these authors have discussed various cp asymmetries in @xmath20 by including the decay products of the top quark and subsequently the w boson and showed that the decay rate cp asymmetry can go up to @xmath21 @xcite . in this work , we revisit the asymmetries in @xmath20 , but also discuss the other three quark decay modes and compare the size of the cp asymmetry in all the channels .",
    "we show that even though in some part of the parameter space , the @xmath22 channel has sizable cp asymmetry with respect to the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath4 channel , this result has to be taken with caution since the former has very small branching ratios ( @xmath23 s ) which makes harder to observe it .",
    "we introduce and discuss another relevant quantity is closely related to the total number of events @xmath24 required to establish a measurable cp violation for a particular mode .",
    "the exact formula is @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 is the standard deviation and @xmath27 is the detection efficiency . ]",
    "@xcite , @xmath28 , for each decay mode , with @xmath29 the cp asymmetry , and @xmath23 the branching ratio for a given decay mode .",
    "this function was shown to be a measure of the number of required charged higgs bosons to be produced at colliders for observing an asymmetry for a given channel .",
    "based on this analysis , we conclude that @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are all optimal channels which could reveal a measurable cp asymmetry at the order of @xmath33 .",
    "we also discuss the cp asymmetry induced by the phases of the flavor violating parameters @xmath34 alone and note that their contribution is small and thus unlikely to account for a measurable cp asymmetry in any of the decay modes considered in this study .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly review the mssm , concentrating on the sources of cp violation .",
    "the decay processes are presented in section [ decays ] and the numerical analysis of the decays under consideration in the section [ numerical ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conc ] .",
    "details of the method used for calculations are presented in the appendix .",
    "the superpotential @xmath35 of the mssm lagrangian and the relevant part of the soft breaking lagrangian @xmath36 are respectively @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the higgs doublets with vacuum expectation values @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively , @xmath42 is the @xmath43 scalar doublet , @xmath44 , @xmath45 are the up- and down - quark @xmath43 singlets , respectively , @xmath46 represent scalar quarks , @xmath47 are the yukawa couplings and @xmath48 are generation indices . here",

    "potential new sources of flavor violation arise from couplings of quarks and squarks to gauginos .",

    "in addition to the flavor dependence in yukawa matrices , there are additional sources of flavor violation due to the soft mass terms and @xmath52-terms .",
    "the richness of the flavor structure depends on the assumed textures of soft mass and @xmath52 terms at the gut scale . assuming both the soft mass and @xmath52-terms to be flavor blind at gut scale can still induce flavor violation at electroweak scale due to their evolution from gut scale down to the electroweak scale using the renormalization group equations .",
    "the flavor violating effects become much bigger if the soft mass and/or @xmath52-term(s ) are flavor dependent at gut scale ( see , for example , @xcite for details ) .    for reasons",
    "we discuss further on , we assume @xmath53 real and a common phase for @xmath54 and @xmath55 . note that @xmath56 has negligible effect since it is multiplied by the strange quark mass .",

    "we do not repeat listing the chargino and neutralino sectors of the mssm here , as we do nt assume a new non - zero cp phase in either sector ; for the details see ref .  @xcite . as the gluino contribution is dominant for",

    "there is a similar interaction for the down case .",
    "considering the number of complex parameters in mssm , further assumptions are needed for simplicity and predictability . in the gaugino sector , two of three gaugino masses could be complex , unless a degenerate spectrum at grand unified theory ( gut ) scale is assumed .",
    "we assume all three gaugino mass terms real at any scale .",
    "the higgsino mass parameter @xmath53 is in principle complex .",
    "however , the phase of @xmath53 is strongly constrained by the electron dipole moment ( edm ) measurements of neutron @xcite and can not exceed values of the order of 0.01 - 0.001 . for the effects of cp violating susy phases on other edms and systems ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we simply neglect this phase and consider @xmath53 real . in the squark sector , there are trilinear soft couplings of quarks , @xmath71 , which are complex .",
    "in addition to these , the misalignment between quarks and squarks arising through the diagonalization of their respective mass matrices leads to new sources of flavor violation , with parameters denoted as @xmath72 .",
    "these are also generally complex , and could have large imaginary parts .",
    "we will assume non - zero flavor violation only between the second and third generations , because the ones involving the first generation are required to be small , based on experimental constraints in @xmath73 and @xmath74 physics @xcite .",
    "the kaon mass splitting parameter @xmath75 due to @xmath76 mixing , and the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath77 put severe constraints on the real and imaginary parts of the flavor violating parameters @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "somewhat weaker bounds can also be obtained from k physics for the up sector between the first and second generations as well but stringent bounds on @xmath79 can be obtained by using the experimental bound on the @xmath80 mixing parameter @xmath81 . in a similar fashion , the flavor violating parameters @xmath82 between the first and third generations can be restricted with the use of low energy b physics measurements ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the common feature of these constraints is that the upper bounds on the flavor parameters involving the first generation have to be less than 0.1 @xcite .",
    "there are however no similar limits on the mixings between the second and third generations so that we will keep them arbitrary .",
    "we assume that there are non - zero phases from the trilinear couplings @xmath71 and intergenerational flavor mixing parameters @xmath34 . for further simplification ,",
    "we assume a common phase @xmath84 = { \\rm arg}[a_d ] \\equiv { \\rm arg}[a]$ ] .",
    "thus , the supersymmetric sources of cp violation of interest in charged higgs decays come from the soft broken terms @xmath85 , @xmath86 and the trilinear scalar coupling @xmath87 , and are introduced through the matrix @xmath88 . in the following section ,",
    "we analyze their effects on the calculation of the cp asymmetry .",

    "these decays are tree level processes and one could calculate the branching ratios , decays widths , etc . with tree - level approximation .    6.5 in    however , it is known that @xcite the cp - odd observable @xmath29 requires a nontrivial phase from feynman diagrams ( called absorptive or strong phase ) , in addition to the weak phase mentioned in the previous section . this way ,",
    "the imaginary part of the amplitude is non - zero , @xmath91 .",
    "one way of introducing such a phase is through one - loop feynman diagrams , where some of the intermediate particles go on - shell .",

    "these events are obtained by running the sensitive parameters randomly in the parameter ranges @xmath151\\in(-\\pi,\\pi),\\ ; m_{\\tilde g}\\in(200,1000)\\,$]gev , @xmath152gev , and @xmath153 .",
    "note that the x - axes are in logarithmic scale .",
    "the branching ratios are calculated by evaluating all the other tree level charged higgs decay widths with the feynhiggs program .",
    "again , the small graphs show the positive part of the asymmetry distribution in the logarithmic scale . from these scatter plots",
    ", one can make a few observations .",
    "each decay channel has a possibility to develop an asymmetry bigger than @xmath1 . in the case of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , there are quite number of events which yield asymmetries around @xmath154 , which is as large an asymmetry as the other two channels can attain .",
    "but the number of charged higgs bosons required to observe such an asymmetry is around @xmath155 for @xmath22 decay , which is @xmath156 to @xmath157 orders of magnitude more than the number needed to make such a measurement in the @xmath135 or @xmath20 channel , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath133 yields a comparable asymmetry distribution with respect to @xmath135 , and also the required number of charged higgs is similar for some part of the parameter space which maximizes the asymmetry .",
    "clearly , the parameter set for the maximal scenario is different for each decay modes .",
    "such a similarity between @xmath4 and @xmath3 channels is not surprising since the @xmath4 decay mode can have a branching ratio comparable to , or larger than , that of @xmath3 decay mode , depending on the value of @xmath57 . in the @xmath4 channel , since the strange quark is light , it is difficult to distinguish it from @xmath158 channel .",
    "so , we can conclude that , depending mainly on the @xmath57 value , the asymmetry in both @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be competitive with the one from @xmath2 if there are enough charged higgs bosons produced at the colliders .",
    "but one needs at least @xmath159 times more statistics for @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases . from fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter1 ] , the distribution of the events for @xmath2 modes , unlike the other channels , are not scattered much since in almost the entire parameter range considered in the scan , its branching ratio remains constant .    in the last figure , fig .",
    "[ fig : scatter2 ] , we perform the same scan of the parameter space as before , but with a non - zero phase @xmath138 $ ] in the up - type squark mixing matrix , while switching the phase of @xmath52 off .",
    "so , instead of running the trilinear coupling @xmath52 and its phase , we run @xmath141 and its phase in the range @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "it seems that the largest asymmetry comes from the @xmath135 process which could be at most as large as @xmath162 , but at least @xmath163 number of higgs produced are required to probe such asymmetry .",
    "additionally , the asymmetry is still significantly smaller than the case where the absorptive phase originated from the trilinear couplings . for the other channels , not only are the asymmetries very small , but as a consequence the number of charged higgs required to observe them is enormous .",
    "in this study , we analyzed the possibility of obtaining measurable signals for cp asymmetry in the charged higgs decays @xmath0 for the second and third generation quarks in the mssm .",
    "above the top quark threshold , charged higgs bosons decay mainly to @xmath2 , but decays to @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath22 are also relevant",
    ". the cp asymmetry of the main decay mode @xmath2 and other non - quark charged higgs decays have been considered previously @xcite . here",
    "we analyzed , discussed and compared all significant quark channels to pinpoint which one is more likely to produce a visible asymmetry at the colliders .",
    "a non - zero cp asymmetry requires an absorptive phase , for which we considered possible interference terms between tree - level and one - loop diagrams .",
    "then we calculated the imaginary parts of one - loop scalar two- and three - point diagrams by first deriving first generic analytical formulas for the discontinuity in such diagrams with the help of cutkosky rules .",
    "we then presented the results obtained for the vectorial and tensorial types of integrals . within the mssm framework , we investigated the effect on the asymmetry of two relevant absorptive phases ; the common phase of the trilinear couplings @xmath52 , and the phase from flavor the violating parameter @xmath141 .",
    "we analyzed their effects separately and without considering any interference effects .",
    "consideration of non - zero values for @xmath131 $ ] predicted asymmetries around @xmath5 for each decay mode .",
    "however , by including the requirement that @xmath149 is proportional to the number of required higgs bosons , our analysis indicates that only @xmath32 and @xmath164 decay processes would be likely to induce a measurable cp asymmetry , with the requirement that at least @xmath165 charged higgs bosons be produced at the colliders . unlike the phase @xmath131 $ ] , the phase @xmath141 can not account a sizable cp asymmetry @xmath29 . in this case",
    ", only @xmath135 can get an asymmetry around @xmath162 , with the requirement that @xmath163 charged higgs bosons must be produced at the colliders , in order to translate into a measurable asymmetry .",
    "the fact that the arguments of @xmath52 and @xmath141 give rise to cp asymmetries of different orders of magnitude justifies _ a posteriori _ neglecting interference effects .",
    "this work is supported in part by nserc of canada under the grant no . sap01105354 .",
    "we calculate the absorptive part of the loop diagrams by applying the cutkosky rules . in general , in the loop integration , we end up with a numerator with scalar , vectorial , or tensorial structures ( and their pseudo counterparts ) , depending on the types of particles running in the loop .",
    "we first consider the scalar case and then outline the method for the vectorial and tensorial cases and present the results .",
    "we discuss self energy and vertex cases separately .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : cuts]-(a ) , if we assume that particles running in the loop are scalar , we get a @xmath166 type scalar two - point passarino - veltman function @xcite .",
    "we use the convention that all external momenta are incoming and the diagram ( a ) of fig .",

    "if we denote this integral as @xmath179 , then the discontinuity can be written @xmath180 where `` @xmath181 '' means that @xmath182 should be considered as a part of the integrand of @xmath173 term .    in a similar manner",
    ", one can calculate a tensorial type of two - point integral . since we will need terms only up to second rank tensors in our calculation",

    "[ fig : relevant ] becomes the sum of the above terms @xmath186 where @xmath187 s include all other contributions arising from the feynman rules and the index @xmath188 runs over loop diagrams .",
    "the evaluation is similar to the two - point function case but the calculation is more cumbersome .",

    "@xmath190 are the internal masses . again using cutkosky rules",
