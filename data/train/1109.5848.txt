    "the study of quantum - interference effects ( qie ) is a central theme in the electron transport properties of mesoscopic and nanoscale conductors .",
    "@xcite when the dimensions of a miniature conductor become comparable to the electron dephasing length @xmath5 , the qie cause notable corrections to the classical ( magneto)conductivity , and the ohm s law may no longer be valid .",
    "@xmath5 is the characteristic length scale over which the electron wavefunction maintains its deterministic phase memory .",
    "@xcite    one of the most extensively studied phase - coherence phenomena is the universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) .",
    "@xcite ucf has the unique feature that their fluctuation magnitudes increase with the lowering of @xmath2 ( usually , at temperatures @xmath6 k ) .",
    "@xcite in most cases , the properties of ucf are studied by measuring the conductance @xmath7 as a function of magnetic field @xmath8 or fermi energy , where the ucf exhibit reproducible but aperiodic  fingerprints , \" provided that the device is constantly maintained at low @xmath2 . on the other hand , the temporal ucf ( tucf ) have not been widely seen in experiments , where @xmath7 fluctuates with time .",
    "@xcite previously ,  direct \" observations of tucf in nonmagnetic metals had only been made in thin bi wires and films @xcite and ag films @xcite at very low @xmath9 k. @xcite besides , the power spectra as a function of @xmath2 or @xmath8 had been studied , @xcite which effectively had integrated over the tucf events over time .",
    "these phenomena were ascribed to perpetual fluctuations of single scattering centers between their bistable positions with time scales @xmath10 , which values have a very broad distribution .",
    "@xcite the current theory on tucf has made no connection with @xmath10 , @xcite though the switching rates of particular defects have been measured in several cases .",
    "@xcite    ruthenium dioxide ( ruo@xmath0 ) crystallizes in the rutile structure and exhibits metallic conductivities , which can be described by the standard boltzmann equation .",
    "@xcite quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) ruo@xmath0 nanowires ( nws ) are stable in the ambient environment and could be applied as interconnects in nanoelectronic devices .",
    "@xcite previously , the magnetoresistance ( mr ) in the weak - localization ( wl ) effect had been studied in three - dimensional ( 3d ) ruo@xmath0 thick films .",
    "@xcite in that case , the ucf were not observed due to the macroscopic sample dimensions . in sharp contrast",
    ", we find in this work that the @xmath7 of individual ruo@xmath0 nw fluctuates markedly with time .",
    "thus , the mr is largely smeared out and difficult to trace .",
    "the tucf persist up to a very high @xmath1 k. furthermore , our measured tucf can be quantitatively described by the saturated and unsaturated theories of feng , @xcite which have been predicted for two decades but not yet been experimentally tested for 1d .",
    "we thus identify the microscopic origin for our tucf to be the existence of rich amounts of mobile defects in metal oxide nws .",
    "the dynamic defects could arise from oxygen nonstoichiometries .",
    "@xcite    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii contains our experimental method .",
    "section iii contains our experimental results and theoretical analysis . a proposal for using the tucf as a sensitive probe for the characteristic time scales of the mobile defects is also discussed .",
    "our conclusion is given in sec .",
    "single - crystalline ruo@xmath0 nws were grown by the thermal evaporation method .",
    "the morphology and atomic structure of the nws were studied by the scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and the transmission electron microscopy . @xcite",
    "four - probe individual nw devices were fabricated by the electron - beam lithography . @xcite",
    "[ figure [ fig1](c ) shows an sem image of the nw67 nanowire device . ]",
    "the resistance measurements were performed on standard @xmath11he and @xmath12he cryostats .",
    "@xcite a linear research lr-700 ac resistance bridge operating at a frequency of 16 hz was employed for resistance measurements .",
    "an excitation current of @xmath13 na ( so that the voltage drop @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant ) was applied to avoid electron heating .",

    "the samples are named according to their diameter .",
    ".parameters for ruo@xmath0 nws .",

    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our assertion that the observed tucf are due to mobile defects is further supported by examining the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ fig3](a ) shows the normalized resistance , @xmath21(30k ) , as a function of @xmath2 for the nw67 and nw54 nanowires from several cooldowns . in the nw67 nanowire",
    ", @xmath20 increases by a large amount @xmath22% as @xmath2 is reduced to 0.26 k. the @xmath20 increases due to 1d wl and @xmath23-@xmath23 interaction ( eei ) effects predict an increase @xmath6% in this sample [ the solid and dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , respectively ] .",
    "the discrepancy demands an extra , governing contribution to the observed  large \" low-@xmath2 resistance rise .",
    "( similar conclusion applies to the nw54 nanowire . ) in contrast , such a discrepancy was not found in conventionally deposited bi wires .",
    "@xcite this extra contribution originates most likely from the scattering of conduction electrons with mobile defects ( two - level systems , tls ) .",
    "@xcite indeed , a logarithmic @xmath2 dependence followed by a  saturation \" behavior is consistent with the tls - induced @xmath20 rise .",
    "@xcite moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) indicates that , as @xmath2 reduces , the measured @xmath20 distributes over a wider range of @xmath20 values at a given @xmath2 .",
    "this is a direct manifestation of the tucf .",
    "note that both the increments in @xmath20 and in the @xmath20 distribution are markedly larger for the nw67 than for the nw54 nanowire , suggesting again a much higher level of mobile defects in the former nw .",

    "[ fig3](b ) for the nw67 nanowire from three cooldowns .",
    "the detailed variations in @xmath20 differ in the three runs , obviously due to the rearrangement of mobile defects ( while the peak - to - peak fluctuation magnitudes remain similar , @xmath24 @xmath25 or @xmath26 ) .",

    "[ fig1](a ) reveals a @xmath27 frequency dependence with @xmath28 in the interval @xmath29 0.0051 hz [ fig .",

    "( c ) noise power spectrum log@xmath30(@xmath32 ) as a function of log@xmath30(@xmath33 ) of nw67 nanowire .",
    "the solid line through the 2.0 ( 6.0 ) k data is a least - square fit to @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) frequency dependence .",
    "[ fig3],width=302,height=188 ]      we would like to point out that tucf could provide more microscopic information about the mobile defects than one previously thought .",
    "specifically , we are referring to the time scale @xmath10 in which the mobile defects perpetually fluctuate between their bistable positions .",
    "though the current tucf theory @xcite has left this @xmath10 aspect unaddressed , it does lead one to a vital piece of information , namely , the number of mobile defects @xmath36 in a phase - coherence segment . in this work ,",
    "we have obtained @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) for the nw67 ( nw54 ) nanowire .",
    "these mobile defects can be configured in @xmath39 possible ways where their respective @xmath7 values vary with @xmath40 , according to ucf .",
    "however , the tucf would not have been observed in an experiment with a measuring time @xmath41 for each taking of the @xmath7 data , if we were in the regime @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the time for the mobile defects to evolve through the entire @xmath44 configurations .",
    "thus the condition @xmath45 must hold in this work .",
    "assuming that @xmath46 , the condition that the dynamics of these @xmath36 mobile defects can be observed in our tucf experiment provides us a lower bound to the @xmath10 of these defects , namely , @xmath47 . specifically , taking @xmath48 s , we have @xmath49 ns for @xmath50 ( nw67 nanowire ) , and @xmath51 s for @xmath52 ( nw54 nanowire ) .",
    "this large variation in @xmath53 or , for that matter , @xmath10 , values of the mobile defects is consistent with current understanding .",
    "the value of @xmath54 ns is in quantitative accord with the properties of tls in disordered metals .",
    "@xmath41 is the upper bound of @xmath10 , since the @xmath55 cases are the slow fluctuation events , which has been excluded in our @xmath56 analysis .",
    "we also note that the above discussion does not rule out the possible existence of very fast tls with time scales shorter than @xmath53 in our nanowires .",
    "our results here thus imply a possible use of @xmath41 for a more microscopic probe of the mobile defects .",
    "we have observed temporal universal conductance fluctuations in ruo@xmath0 nanowires up to very high temperatures of @xmath57 k. the tucf originate from rich and vigorous mobile defects ( e.g. , oxygen nonstoichiometries ) in as - grown nanowires .",
    "the measured tucf magnitudes are well described by the 1d theory and the numbers of mobile defects have been evaluated .",
    "furthermore , we discuss that the microscopic information on the characteristic time scales of the mobile defects may be learned from tucf measurements .",
