    "accretion powered millisecond x - ray pulsars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) show small amplitude , almost sinusoidal x - ray time variations , the dominant periods of which are thought to correspond to the spin periods of the neutron stars ( e.g. , lamb & boutloukos 2007 ) . lamb et al ( 2009 ) argued that the millisecond x - ray variations are produced by an x - ray emitting hot spot located at a magnetic pole of the rotating neutron star , and that so long as the center of the hot spot is only slightly off the rotation axis the x - ray variations produced will have small amplitudes and become almost sinusoidal .",
    "they also suggested that if the hot spot is located close to the rotation axis , a slight drift of the hot spot away from the rotation axis leads to appreciable changes in the amplitudes and phases of the x - ray variations .",
    "lamb et al ( 2009 ) pointed out that a temporal change in mass accretion rates and hence the radius of the magnetosphere , for example , can cause such a drift of the hot spot .",
    "it is now well known that neutron stars can support various kinds of oscillation modes ( e.g. , mcdermott et al 1988 ) .",
    "there have been , however , no observational evidences that definitely indicate global oscillations of the stars , probably except for quasi - periodic oscillations observed in the tail of giant x - ray flares from soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) ( duncan 1998 ; israel et al 2005 ; strohmayer & watts 2005 , 2006 ; watts & strohmayer 2006 ) , which are believed to have a global magnetic field as strong as @xmath17 g at the surface ( e.g. , woods & thompson 2006 ) .",
    "the qpos observed in sgrs may be caused by damping oscillations excited when a sudden restructuring of a global magnetic field in the neutron star takes place . for any global oscillations of a neutron star to become observable , mechanisms are needed that excite the oscillations to have amplitudes large enough to produce observable variations in the radiation flux .",
    "the @xmath18 mechanism can be an example of such excitation mechanisms for low frequency @xmath19-modes and @xmath0-modes in the surface fluid layers of mass accreting neutron stars ( e.g. , strohmayer & lee 1996 ; narayan & cooper 2007 ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0-modes propagating in the surface fluid layers of mass accreting neutron stars have been proposed for the burst oscillations observed during type i x - ray bursts in low mass x - ray binaries ( strohmayer et al 1996 , 1997 ; heyl 2004 , 2005 ; lee 2004 ; lee & strohmayer 2005 ) .",
    "it is also argued that retrograde oscillation modes can be destabilized by emitting gravitational waves if they satisfy the frequency condition given by @xmath20 ( friedman & schutz 1978 ) , and that @xmath0-modes , which are retrograde modes , are to become unstable to the gravitational radiation reaction ( andersson 1998 ) , where @xmath5 is the spin frequency of the star , @xmath21 is the oscillation frequency observed in the corotating frame , and @xmath4 is the azimuthal wave number of the mode .",
    "@xmath12-modes in the fluid core of rapidly rotating neutron stars have been a subject of intensive studies ( e.g. , lindblom , owen , & morsink 1998 ; owen et al .",
    "1998 ; lockitch & friedman 1999 ; yoshida & lee 2000ab , 2001 ) and are now regarded as a possible candidate for oscillation modes of a neutron star that are excited to produce observable effects .    if a hot spot on a rapidly rotating neutron star can produce clean light curves without any strong harmonics of the spin frequency , it may be possible to use the light curves as a probe into oscillation modes that are excited to periodically disturb the spot so that the periodicities of the modes manifest themselves in the light curves . in this paper",
    ", we calculate light curves by a hot spot taking account of the disturbances by @xmath0-modes in the fluid core , which are assumed to be excited by emitting gravitational waves .",
    "although the amplitudes of the @xmath0-modes are confined into the core , in the presence of a global magnetic field the amplitudes may penetrate to the surface fluid ocean ( e.g. , lee 2010 ) .",
    "in general , the radial component of the displacement vector of the @xmath0-modes at the surface have amplitudes much smaller that the horizontal and toroidal components , and hence the temperature variations at the surface produced by the @xmath0-modes would be too small to have observable amplitudes .",
    "if the horizontal component of the @xmath0-modes is large enough to deform the hot spot appreciably , on the other hand , the periodic deformation of the spot may manifest itself in the light curves produced by the hot spot .",
    " 2 is for method of solution , and numerical results are given in  3 , and  4 is for conclusion .",
    "we consider a rapidly rotating neutron star having a hot spot on the surface and assume that @xmath0-modes in the fluid core are destabilized by emitting gravitational waves ( friedman & morsink 1998 ; andersson 1998 ) .",
    "for a distant observer , light curves produced by the hot spot will then be observed to have periodic flux variations with the dominant period equal to the spin period of the star .",
    "if the core @xmath0-modes excited by emitting gravitational waves can penetrate the solid crust to have sufficient amplitudes at the surface to give periodic disturbances to the spot , it is expected that the periodicities due to the core @xmath0-modes will be contained in the light curves from the hot spot .",
    "it is the aim of this section to present a method of calculation of light curves produced by a surface hot spot which is disturbed by a core @xmath0-mode .",
    "it is convenient to use two cartesian coordinate systems @xmath22 and @xmath23 and to assume the distant observer is in the @xmath24-@xmath25 and @xmath26-@xmath27 planes , where the @xmath25-axis is the spin axis of the star and @xmath27-axis is pointing to the distant observer and @xmath28 .",
    "we denote by @xmath29 and @xmath30 spherical polar coordinates associated with the cartesian coordinates , where the @xmath25-axis ( @xmath27-axis ) corresponds to the axis defined by @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 the inclination angle between the @xmath25-axis and @xmath27-axis .",
    "if we assume schwarzschild metric to calculate photon trajectories around the spinning neutron star , for a photon emitted from a point @xmath34 on the surface of the star and reaching the distant observer , the angle @xmath35 is given by ( see pechenick , ftaclas & cohen 1983 ) =_r^^-1/2 , where @xmath36 is the impact parameter given by b = rwhere @xmath37 is the angle between the surface normal vector @xmath38 and the direction vector @xmath39 , measured by a non - rotating observer at the stellar surface , of the photon that reaches the distant observer , and @xmath40 is the schwarzschild radius , and @xmath12 and @xmath41 are the radius and mass of the star , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the gravitational constant and the light velocity , respectively . note that the three vectors @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath44 are coplanar , where @xmath44 is the unit vector along the @xmath27-axis .",

    "hereafter , we let @xmath57 and @xmath61 denote coordinates defined in the corotating frame of the star .    to take account of the effects of periodic disturbances due to core @xmath0-modes on the spot , we first calculate small amplitude oscillations of rotating and magnetized neutron stars in newtonian dynamics , disregarding general relativistic effects on the oscillations ( lee 2010 ) . we introduce a dipole magnetic field given by @xmath62",
    "whose magnetic axis is assumed to align with the spin axis of the star , where @xmath63 is the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "since the magnetic pressure in the deep interior is much smaller than the gas pressure for neutron stars with a magnetic field whose strength at the surface is comparable to or less than @xmath64 g , we treat the fluid core as being non - magnetic ( e.g. , lee 2007 , 2010 ) .",

    "since the neutron star core is nearly isentropic such that @xmath188 with @xmath146 being the brunt - visl frequency , we only have to consider the @xmath189 @xmath0-modes , for which we have @xmath190 , and we obtain the frequency @xmath191 for @xmath192 in the co - rotating frame of the star .",
    "although no detection of periodicities @xmath193 associated with the @xmath13 core @xmath0-mode has so far been reported , any detection of periodicities caused by the @xmath189 core @xmath0-modes in the x - ray millisecond pulsation makes it possible to use the frequency deviation given by @xmath194 to derive information about the equations of state and the thermal stratification in the core .    employing spcae - time metric numerically computed for rotating neutron stars in stead of the schwarzschild metric , cadeau et al ( 2005 , 2007 )",
    "have discussed the frame dragging effects on the light curves produced by a small hot spot on the surface of rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "cadeau et al ( 2007 ) have concluded that in most cases the differences in the light curves between the choice of metric are smaller than the differences caused by the spherical or oblate shape of the initial emission surface .",
    "we think this is also the case for light curves produced by a finite hot spot periodically modified by the @xmath0-mode .",
    "we may also guess that the effects of the rotational deformation of neutron stars on the frequency and surface wave - pattern of the @xmath0-mode , for example , could be more significant than the frame dragging effects for light curves .",
    "we believe that at the current stage of investigation the frame dragging may be regarded as one of the effects that become discernible only after very accurate light curve determination becomes possible observationally and theoretically .    to use a surface hot spot of a rapidly rotating neutron star as a probe into core @xmath0-modes , the modes must penetrate the solid crust to have sufficient amplitudes at the surface .",
    "the detectability of periodicities due to the core @xmath0-modes in light curves therefore may depend on , for example , the thickness of the solid crust , the property of the surface fluid ocean , and the strength of the magnetic field and so on . in this paper , although we have used the functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 computed for a low mass , cold neutron star model with a thick solid crust , which makes the frequency spectrum simple , it is desirable to use the functions computed for more massive neutron stars as well , which may have a thin solid crust and hence have a different oscillation frequency spectrum from that for a cold low mass neutron star . for accretion powered neutron stars , it is also desirable to use mass accreting neutron star models with a hot fluid ocean and solid crust , with which we can examine how the amplitudes of core @xmath0-modes at the surface depends on the physical properties of the fluid ocean and solid crust .",
    "the existence of a magnetic field is another important factor we have to consider , particularly to determine the wave patterns at the surface .",
    "although the effects of a magnetic field on the displacement vector @xmath70 of core @xmath0-modes have been examined only for a dipole field whose axis aligns with the spin axis , we need to examine how an oblique dipole field and a field different from a dipole one change the surface wave patterns ( e.g. , heng & spitkovsky 2009 ) .    applying a weak nonlinear theory , arras et al ( 2003 ) have estimated the saturation level for the @xmath0-mode energy @xmath195 by considering nonlinear transfer of energy to the sea of stellar inertial oscillation modes of rotating stars with negligible buoyancy and elastic restoring force and without magnetic field . for the saturation energy in the strong driving limit of the @xmath0-mode , they obtained an estimate given by @xmath196 , which may amount to the mode amplitude parameter @xmath197 , where @xmath198 denotes the spin frequency of the star .",
    "if this amplitude estimation is correct , the amplitude parameter @xmath6 for neutron stars spinning at @xmath199 becomes of order of @xmath200 , which is by one order of magnitude smaller than the value @xmath174 used in this paper for presentation and may suggest that the detectability of the periodic modulation due to the @xmath0-modes is not very high even for small values of @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we have been discussing the possibility of using x - ray light curves from a hot spot as a probe into the core @xmath0-modes of neutron stars , but it is also conceivable that periodicities due to the @xmath0-modes , which may shake the surface magnetic field , are contained in the pulses , possibly as drifting sub- or micro - pulses , from millisecond radio pulsars .",

    "<S> we calculate light curves produced by a hot spot of a rapidly rotating neutron star , assuming that the spot is perturbed by a core @xmath0-mode , which is destabilized by emitting gravitational waves . to calculate light curves , we take account of relativistic effects such as the doppler boost due to the rapid rotation and light bending assuming the schwarzschild metric around the neutron star . </S>",
