    "classical multiplier problems have been studied for a long time using techniques of analysis . for nearly 40 years",
    ", a probabilistic approach has been developed which allowed further studies in operator theory .",
    "the early probabilistic techniques were based on properties of brownian motion and martingales . in late 1970",
    "s and early 1980 s this study was generalised to a setup where markov processes were in focus .",
    "some early research was done by p.a .",
    "he presented in @xcite probabilistic techniques which were used to prove boundedness of littlewood - paley functions by means of martingales . after the presentation of these new techniques , boundedness results on @xmath1",
    "were revisited . in early years",
    ", the main approach was to develop alternative proofs of classical results in the language of probability .",
    "later some generalisations followed .",
    "we recommend the reader ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iv ) to have a grasp of the probabilistic approach to this theory when brownian motion is considered as the markov process of interest .",
    "together with the boundedness of operators , multiplier theorems , among which there are mihlin s and marcinkiewicz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* iv.5 ) , are also widely studied from the probabilistic point of view .",
    "well - known multiplier theorems became the focus of this research , and it was aimed to determine whether their constraints could be generalised by the tools of martingale theory .",
    "one of these studies was done by n. bouleau and d. lamberton in @xcite where the authors proved boundedness of an operator using a product of a markov process with a stable process .",
    "their arguments yields a new multiplier theorem with a new set of conditions .",
    "the condition is the integrability of a bounded borel measurable function with respect to a kernel corresponding to their product process .",
    "our motivation originates from aforementioned paper @xcite . in the their work ,",
    "n. bouleau and d. lamberton worked with a general type of processes .",
    "however the tools of the general case are restrictive . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we focused on a specific process , namely a symmetric stable process , and we replaced brownian motion of the classical setup with this stable process . by means of these processes , we introduced new types of littlewood - paley operators , and proved boundedness results which could not be proved for general markov processes .",
    "these new operators present an opportunity to study multiplier results obtained in @xcite once again .",
    "now we have a set of more specific tools using which we aim to prove a new multiplier theorem in this paper and present an application of our new boundedness results .    in @xcite and",
    "later in @xcite , we studied some operators related to classical littlewood - paley theory . for this purpose , we adapted probabilistic approach to the theory . in the classical setup , one uses a @xmath2-dimensional brownian motion in the upper half space of @xmath3 and let it run until the process hits the boundary . in our work , we replaced @xmath0-dimensional component of brownian motion with a symmetric stable process and kept 1-dimensional brownian motion as is . under this new setup , we introduced some new operators , and we proved their boundedness under certain conditions .",
    "first of all , we introduce some preliminary results from @xcite and state references for details in this section . throughout the paper @xmath4 will denote a positive constant .",
    "its value may change from line to line .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-dimensional right continuous ( rotationally ) symmetric @xmath5-stable process @xmath6 for @xmath7 , that is , @xmath6 is a right continuous markov process with independent and stationary increments whose characteristic function is @xmath8 .",
    "the function @xmath9 will denote its ( symmetric ) transition density such that @xmath10 and @xmath11 will denote the corresponding semi - group @xmath12 .",
    "here @xmath13 is the probability measure for the process started at @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the expectation taken with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "a well - known property of symmetric @xmath16stable processes is that the transition density @xmath17 satisfies the scaling property @xmath18 which can be verified by using the characteristic function .",
    "similarly , we denote a one - dimensional brownian motion ( independent from @xmath19 ) by @xmath20 and the probability measure for the process started at @xmath21 by @xmath22 .",
    "the process of interest is the product @xmath23 started at @xmath24 , the corresponding probability measure and the expectation are @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "next , define the stopping time @xmath27 which is the first time @xmath28 hits the boundary of @xmath3 .",
    "note that the first exit time @xmath29 depends only on @xmath20 due to the independence of @xmath20 and @xmath19 .    to provide a connection between probabilistic and deterministic integrals",
    ", we will use two main tools ; a new measure @xmath30 and the vertical green function . denoting the lebesgue measure on @xmath31 by @xmath32 , we define the measure @xmath30 by @xmath33 note that this is not a probability measure .",
    "let @xmath34 denote the  expectation \" with respect to this measure .",
    "we note that for any measurable set @xmath35 in @xmath31 , @xmath36 and so the law of @xmath37 under this new measure is @xmath32 . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use @xmath38 to denote lebesgue measure on @xmath31 .",
    "just to emphasize the connection between the measure @xmath30 and the lebesgue measure , sometimes we will use @xmath39 instead of @xmath38 . but both of them should be treated as the same measure .",
    "second , for a positive borel function @xmath40 , the vertical green function is given by @xmath41=\\int_0^\\infty ( s\\wedge a)f(s)ds.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this property will be used together with the new measure @xmath30 in section [ multiplier_section ] .",
    "harmonic functions play a key role in showing boundedness of littlewood - paley operators . here",
    "we adapt the probabilistic interpretation of a harmonic function .",
    "a continuous function @xmath42 is said to be harmonic ( with respect to the process @xmath28 ) if @xmath43 is a martingale with respect to the filtration @xmath44 and the probability measure @xmath25 for any starting point @xmath24 .",
    "one way to obtain such a harmonic function is to start with a bounded borel function @xmath45 and define an extension @xmath46 by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the exit distribution of one - dimensional brownian motion which is given by @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) . by a slight abuse of notation",
    ", we will denote both the function on @xmath31 and its extension to the upper - half space by the same letter , that is , @xmath50 .",
    "next , we define the semi - group @xmath51 .",
    "this semi - group provides us a representation of the extension @xmath52 we note that this is a convolution with the probability kernel @xmath53 which is radially decreasing in @xmath54 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) ) and its fourier transform is @xmath55    an immediate result is that both of the semi - groups @xmath56 and @xmath57 are invariant under the lebesgue measure , that is , @xmath58 this follows from the symmetry of the kernels and the invariance under the dual action .",
    "one of the key tools in proving certain inequalities is the density estimates on @xmath17 .",
    "although there is an infinite series expansion , it is not very easy to work with . for this purpose",
    ", we will use the two - sided estimate @xmath59 @xmath60 , which allows us to control the tail of the transition density .",
    "in addition , we will need to control the derivative of @xmath17 .",
    "the following lemma provides this control .",
    "let @xmath61 denote the @xmath62 partial derivative in the direction of @xmath63 coordinate .",
    "[ lemma_der_of_dens ] for @xmath64 and @xmath65    * @xmath66 and + * @xmath67 whenever @xmath21 .",
    "first note that ( ii . ) follows from ( i. ) once we use the scaling property @xmath68 hence it is enough to prove part ( i. ) .",
    "the density function @xmath69 is obtained by fourier inversion of @xmath70 . moreover ,",
    "the function @xmath71 is integrable for any multi - index @xmath72 .",
    "hence the density function and all of its partial derivatives are bounded .",
    "another way to obtain the density function is to use @xmath73 , the density of an @xmath74 stable subordinator whose laplace transform is given by @xmath75 . using @xmath73",
    ", we can express the density as @xmath76 this can be verified by taking the fourier transform of the equation ( [ dens_rep ] ) . for some constant @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , we can obtain the first partial derivative in @xmath79 , @xmath80 temporarily , let us denote the @xmath0-dimensional density function by @xmath81 and define @xmath82 whenever @xmath83 .",
    "the equation ( [ der_of_dens ] ) can be written as @xmath84 and hence using the upper - bound in ( [ sas_estimate ] ) @xmath85 which gives the result for @xmath86 .",
    "the case @xmath87 is similar when we observe that @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "in this section , we will discuss some preliminary results on our jump process .",
    "one can find the details for general jump processes in @xcite .",
    "first , let us define a new martingale by @xmath90 where @xmath28 is the product process explained in the previous section and @xmath40 is a bounded measurable function .",
    "@xmath91 is a jump process and , moreover , @xmath91 has at most countably many jumps ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "17.1 , p 132 ) for the details ) .",
    "so we can label these jumps as @xmath92 so that each @xmath93 is either predictable or inaccessible with disjoint graphs .",
    "moreover , the process @xmath91 has jumps only at these times @xmath93 and jump sizes are bounded .",
    "here we do not assume that @xmath93 s are ordered , that is , @xmath94 does not imply @xmath95 .",
    "now consider the process @xmath96 we note that this process makes a jump of size @xmath97 at time @xmath98 and constant afterwards if the jumps size is small , that is , if the jump size @xmath99 .",
    "( in this paper , a jump at time @xmath98 is referred as a large jump , if its size is @xmath100 . ) since the vertical component @xmath101 of @xmath28 is continuous , the jumps correspond to those of the horizontal component @xmath6 .",
    "so this process ignores large jumps of @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath40 is real - valued , we can write @xmath102 as a difference of two increasing processes , one with positive jumps and the other with negative jumps .",
    "hence @xmath102 admits a compensator , say @xmath103 .",
    "so the process @xmath104 obtained as @xmath105 is a martingale .",
    "note that @xmath106 has no small jumps at time @xmath98 .",
    "moreover , @xmath107 s are pairwise orthogonal , since each of them correspond to jumps at different times .",
    "in other words , @xmath108 whenever @xmath109 for all @xmath21 .",
    "then by the orthogonality lemma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 17.2 ) , we obtain @xmath110 and also @xmath111 for @xmath112 then using this orthogonality property , we can write @xmath113&={\\mathbb{e}}^{(x , a)}\\left[(m_\\infty-\\sum_{i=1}^mm_\\infty^i+\\sum_{i=1}^mm_\\infty^i)^2\\right]\\\\                              & = { \\mathbb{e}}^{(x , a)}\\left[(m_\\infty-\\sum_{i=1}^mm_\\infty^i)^2+(\\sum_{i=1}^mm_\\infty^i)^2\\right]\\\\                              & \\geq{\\mathbb{e}}^{(x , a)}\\left[(\\sum_{i=1}^mm_\\infty^i)^2\\right]\\\\                              & = \\sum_{i=1}^m{\\mathbb{e}}^{(x , a)}\\left[(m_\\infty^i)^2\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence we see @xmath114&= { \\mathbb{e}}^{(x , a)}\\left[(\\sum_{i=1}^mm_\\infty^i)^2\\right]\\leq { \\mathbb{e}}^{(x , a)}\\left[(m_\\infty)^2\\right]<\\infty\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for any positive integer @xmath115 , and so the series @xmath116 $ ] converges . we conclude that @xmath117 converges in @xmath118 , say to @xmath119 .",
    "so @xmath119 is the purely discontinuous part of @xmath91 consisting of small jumps .",
    "hence @xmath120_t=\\sum_{0\\leq s \\leq t } ( \\delta u_s)^2 $ ] . denoting the continuous part by @xmath121",
    ", we write @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the part corresponding to large jumps . since @xmath101 is brownian motion , two processes @xmath124 and @xmath125 are indistinguishable .",
    "moreover , @xmath126_t=\\langle m^c\\rangle_t + \\sum_{0\\leq s \\leq t } ( \\delta m_s)^2\\ ] ] and @xmath126_\\infty\\geq [ u]_\\infty.\\ ] ] then by the burkholder - davis - gundy inequality @xmath127_t^{p/2}m(dx)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so @xmath128_\\infty^{p/2}\\leq c { { \\mathbb{e}}^{m_a}}[m]_\\infty^{p/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after using the burkholder - davis - gundy inequality once again and applying doob s inequality , we have @xmath129_t^{p/2}&\\leq c\\ , { { \\mathbb{e}}^{m_a}}\\left ( \\sup_{0\\leq s \\leq t } |m_s|^p\\right)\\leq c\\ , { { \\mathbb{e}}^{m_a}}|m_t|^{p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which leads to @xmath129_\\infty^{p/2}\\leq c\\ , { { \\mathbb{e}}^{m_a}}|m_\\infty|^{p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence by ( [ law_of_exit ] ) @xmath130",
    "let @xmath131 be a bounded borel function on @xmath132 and @xmath133 . define      where @xmath135 is the translation operator given by @xmath136 and @xmath137 is the extension of @xmath40 to upper - half space @xmath3",
    "as described before , that is , @xmath138 first we should note that the semigroup @xmath57 commutes with the translation operator .",
    "this follows from the commutative property of the semigroup @xmath11 of the lvy process @xmath19 with @xmath135 . to be clear , @xmath139 for any @xmath83 .",
    "hence by using the commutativity of operators @xmath57 and @xmath135 and the semigroup property of @xmath57 , we can write @xmath140 in this form , it is easy to see that @xmath141 is linear , that is , for any @xmath142 and @xmath143 , we have @xmath144 .",
    "second , we will show that this operator is well - defined on @xmath145 , the space of smooth and compactly supported functions , which is dense in @xmath1 .",
    "for this purpose , let @xmath146 .",
    "since @xmath147 is a bounded function and @xmath148 it is enough to consider the following two integrals : @xmath149 and @xmath150 to bound the first integral , note that @xmath151 then @xmath152 to bound the second integral we use lemma [ lemma_der_of_dens ] .",
    "we observe that @xmath153 hence @xmath154 then @xmath155 hence @xmath141 is well - defined on @xmath145 .",
    "we note that the above are finite if @xmath156 . although the tools on the jump processes in section 1 works whenever @xmath157 , the operator @xmath141 is well - defined if @xmath158 .",
    "hence we restrict our result to the case @xmath156 .",
    "let @xmath146 , @xmath147 be a bounded borel function and @xmath141 be as defined in ( [ op_t ] ) .",
    "without loss of generality we may assume @xmath147 is positive valued , since otherwise we can write this function as a combination of positive and negative parts , @xmath161 , and apply the argument to both @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "in the first step , we will use the purely discontinuous martingale @xmath119 which was defined in the previous section . by means of @xmath119 ,",
    "let us define a new martingale @xmath164 where @xmath20 is the 1-dimensional brownian component of @xmath165 .",
    "by considering @xmath166 and using burkholder - davis - gundy inequality , we can bound the expectation of this martingale .",
    "that is , @xmath167_\\infty^{p/2 } m(dx)\\\\              & \\leq c \\ , \\int { \\mathbb{e}}^{(x , a ) } [ u]_\\infty^{p/2 } m(dx)\\leq c \\ , \\int { \\mathbb{e}}^{(x , a ) } |u_\\infty|^{p } m(dx)\\leq c \\ , ||f||^p_p \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the inequality ( [ u_f_relation ] ) .",
    "now let @xmath168 be the conjugate exponent of @xmath169 so that @xmath170 and @xmath171 be a compactly supported smooth function in @xmath172 .",
    "similar to before , we denote the extension of @xmath171 by @xmath173 or by @xmath174 .",
    "we also denote the martingale which is obtained from @xmath171 by @xmath175 .    by the product rule for martingales with jumps ( see @xcite ) we obtain @xmath176 note that @xmath177 throughout the rest of this section , we will denote the above function by @xmath178 for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we write for any @xmath179 @xmath180 then we have @xmath181 if we use the lvy system formula ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) here , we obtain @xmath182 the semigroup @xmath56 is invariant under the measure @xmath115 .",
    "hence the last line equals @xmath183 next , if we set @xmath184 and write @xmath185 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are positive and negative parts of the function , respectively , then we can apply the green kernel of the vertical component ( i.e. , the brownian component ) to the integrals @xmath188 then the integral in ( [ int_green ] ) becomes @xmath189    in the second step , we will express @xmath190 in terms of the above integral .",
    "for this purpose , we will denote the usual inner product by @xmath191 and write @xmath192 if @xmath171 is as taken before , we can write @xmath193 by the inequalities ( [ first_int_bound ] ) and ( [ second_int_bound ] ) and using the assumption that @xmath171 is compactly supported and continuous , we conclude that this inner product is bounded , that is , @xmath194 hence one can use fubini to interchange the order of integrals in ( [ inner_product ] ) to write @xmath195 at this point , as a side note , we observe that this inner product relates to @xmath196 which was defined in @xcite by @xmath197 ^ 2\\frac{dh}{|h|^{d+\\alpha } } \\,dt   \\right]^{1/2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]          in the third step , we will find a bound for the inner product above . for this purpose , we apply the hlder inequality first to get @xmath200 by ( [ v - infty ] ) , we obtain @xmath201 and also we have @xmath202 by ( [ law_of_exit ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath203 for any @xmath204 , by ( [ main1 ] ) and ( [ main2 ] ) .",
    "now if we let @xmath205 , then we obtain @xmath206 hence @xmath141 is a bounded operator on @xmath145 and it extends to @xmath1 .      in the theorem",
    "above , we proved that the operator @xmath141 is bounded on @xmath1 .",
