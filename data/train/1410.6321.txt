    "interest rate is a rate charged for the use of the money .",
    "its stochastic character , which can be observed on financial markets , motivates stochastic modelling of interest rates .",
    "one class of such models , so called short rate models , is based on specifying a stochastic differential equation for the instantaneous interest rate ( also called short rate ) or several factors which determine it .",
    "interest rates with other maturities are then computed from bond prices which are obtained as solutions to a parabolic partial differential equations .",
    "more details about interest rate modelling can be found , for example , in books @xcite , @xcite .",
    "multi - factor models include various factors to describe the short rate better : they consider stochastic volatility ( see a book @xcite for a recent treatment of these models ) , effect of interest rates in a monetary union to a country before it joins the union in @xcite , @xcite , writing the short rate as a sum of factors for example in @xcite where the factors are interpreted as current effects of streams of economic `` news '' .",
    "one of the possible approaches to calibrating a model is comparing the market interest rates to those determined by the model , see for example @xcite for such a calibration of one - factor models and @xcite for a two - factor model .",
    "this requires s a quick computation of bond prices , since these need to be computed for all the data used in the calibration and every parameter set considered in the optimization process .",
    "closed form solution to the partial differential equation for the bond prices is , however , available only for a few models .",
    "therefore , there are papers finding approximate analytical solutions for more complicated models , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider a model which uses short rate and long rate and is parametrized by means of taking the long rate and the spread ( which is the difference between the short and the long rates ) .",
    "the original model was formulated in @xcite in the 80s . however",
    ", modelling spread is an interesting feature also later , cf .",
    "@xcite and a recent paper @xcite for its application for predictive purposes .",
    "a generalization of the original paper @xcite , considering a more general form of volatilities and correlations , has been studied using econometric time series techniques in @xcite .",
    "model with these variables is one of the two - factor models considered in @xcite , to which they applied their estimation methodology .",
    "we consider pricing bonds in this model and apply perturbation analysis ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) to an integral and a nonlinear equation which needs to be solved in order to apply the approximate analytical formula for bond prices proposed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following section we present the schaefer - schwartz model @xcite and the mathematical problem which is solved in evaluating their approximate formula for bond prices . in section 3",
    "we introduce a small parameter which is used in asymptotic expansions in subsequent subsections .",
    "section 4 provides numerical examples of the results obtained by the expansions and compare them with values obtained numerically .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion which summarizes the results .",
    "the model proposed by schaefer and schwartz in @xcite is formulated in terms of stochastic differential equations for the consol rate ( defined as the yield of a bond that has a constant continuous coupon and infinite maturity , also called long rate ) @xmath0 and spread @xmath1 between the short rate and the consol rate .",
    "the authors assume the variables to follow the system of stochastic differential equations @xmath2 where @xmath3 are wiener processed which are assumed to be uncorrelated ; schaefer and schwartz provide references to empirical studies supporting this assumption .",
    "this specification assumes that the spread evolves according to ornstein - uhlenbeck process ( [ eq : sde - spread ] ) which is a mean - reverting process with a conditional normal distribution .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for the spread between the interest rates which can take both positive and negative values .",
    "the interest rates themselves should not attain negative values which motivates the square root type of volatility in the process ( [ eq : sde - consol ] ) for the consol rate .",
    "note that if it is assumed to be mean - reverting too , we obtain the well known square root bessel process .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , the function @xmath4 have no effect on the partial differential equation for the bond prices and hence it is left in the general form .",
    "the price @xmath5 of a discount bond with maturity @xmath6 when the current spread equals @xmath1 and consol rate equals @xmath0 is a solution to the partial differential equation , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation ( 4 ) ) , @xmath7 for @xmath8 , with initial condition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is so called market price of spread risk , which is assumed to be constant .",
    "the approximation proposed by schaefer and schwartz is based on finding the exact solution an equation closely related to ( [ eq : exact ] ) . in particular",
    ", they change the term @xmath1 in the coefficient of @xmath12 to a constant @xmath13 .",
    "then , the solution @xmath14 of the modified equation can be separated in the form @xmath15 where the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be expressed in the closed form .",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper @xcite for the details of the motivation ( which is based on expressing the stochastic differential equations in so called risk neutral equivalent measure and temporarily disregarding their stochastic part ) and mathematical derivation of the problem corresponding to finding @xmath13 according to the selected criterion ; now we present on the formulation of the resulting problem .",
    "the final result is , that the constant @xmath13 is chosen as the solution to the nonlinear equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the solution of the system @xmath21 with initial conditions @xmath22 , @xmath23 which are the values of the spread and consol rate for which the bond price is being evaluated .",
    "they compare the results of bond prices computed by this procedure with numerically solving the partial differential equation ( [ eq : exact ] ) and conclude that the approximation gives accurate results",
    ".    however , the expressions for the integral @xmath24 defined by ( [ eq : integral ] , which are given by the authors , are quite complicated ( cf .",
    "* equation ( a6 ) ) ) :    * for @xmath25 @xmath26 * for @xmath27 @xmath28 * for @xmath29 @xmath30 , \\label{eq : a6c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath31 is the gamma function , @xmath32 is the incomplete gamma function , @xmath33 and @xmath34 is assumed to be positive ( this means @xmath35 which is the empirically relevant case , for which in the equilibrium the consol rate is higher as the instantaneous rate ) .",
    "these complicated expressions motivate us to use perturbation methods and derive the approximations to integral ( [ eq : integral ] ) as well as to the solution to the nonlinear equation ( [ eq : nonlinear ] ) which are easily evaluated .",
    "alternatively , the system of ordinary differential equations ( [ eq : ode : s ] ) , ( [ eq : ode : l ] ) can be easily solved numerically ; we use this approach to obtain numerical values with which we will compare our approximations .",
    "firstly , we note that the equation ( [ eq : ode : s ] ) with initial condition @xmath22 has the solution @xmath36 we introduce the small parameter @xmath37 which will be used in the subsequent computations .",
    "note that is represents the difference between the current value of the spread and its equilibrium value .",
    "interest rates are expressed as decimal numbers in term structure models ( for example , 0.01 corresponds to the interest rate of 1 percent _ per annum _ ) , so we can expect this parameter to be `` small '' . using this parameter",
    ", we express @xmath38 as @xmath39      we write @xmath20 in the form of an asymptotic series in integer powers of @xmath40 : @xmath41 from the initial condition @xmath23 we obtain @xmath42 substituting ( [ eq : l : expansion ] ) and ( [ eq : s : solution ] ) into the ordinary differential equation ( [ eq : ode : l ] ) we obtain the system of equations for the functions @xmath43 : @xmath44 thus , @xmath45 and the functions @xmath43 can be computed in the closed form by evaluating recursively @xmath46 they turn out to be linear combinations of exponential functions ; we list some of the first ones : @xmath47 with the coefficients given by @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 we assume that @xmath51 is not an integral multiple of @xmath52 which is satisfied in a generic case since @xmath51 is the adjusted equilibrium value of the spread ( in financial setting , its equilibrium value under the equivalent risk - neutral pricing measure ) given by ( [ eq : mu_hat ] ) and @xmath52 is the speed of mean - reversion of spread to the equilibrium value .",
    "since the coefficients @xmath54 of the expansion ( [ eq : l : expansion ] ) are linear combinations of exponentials , we can easily derive a similar expansion for the integral ( [ eq : integral ] ) .",
    "we write ( since it is this multiple of the integral that will be used in the following section ) @xmath55 then , @xmath56 and the first terms are given by @xmath57 with the coefficients given by @xmath58    @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61      we rewrite the equation ( [ eq : nonlinear ] ) into the form @xmath62 and write its solution @xmath13 as @xmath63    now , it is easy to write both the left - hand side and the right - hand side of ( [ eq : nonlinear : mod ] ) in an asymptotic expansion in @xmath40 , using ( [ eq : s_hat_expansion ] ) , expansion of @xmath64 given by ( [ eq : tau_bar_expansion ] ) and by writing ( in what follows , for the sake of brevity we omit argument @xmath6 in the coefficients ) @xmath65 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    matching the coefficients of order @xmath66 in ( [ eq : nonlinear : mod ] ) we obtain that @xmath67 k_n & = & rhs_n , \\label{eq : kn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for @xmath68 , the right - hand side @xmath69 of ( [ eq : kn ] ) is expressed by the previously computed quantities .",
    "again , we write the first terms which will be used in our numerical experiment : @xmath70 note that the result ( [ eq : k0 ] ) is in accordance with comparing ( [ eq : a6b ] ) with ( [ eq : nonlinear ] ) from which it follows that @xmath71 if @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath72 ) as it is also noted in the paper @xcite .",
    "we use the values which are used as base parameters in @xcite : @xmath73 .",
    "the initial values of spread and consol rate considered in @xcite are @xmath74 $ ] for @xmath75 and @xmath76 $ ] for @xmath77 .",
    "we take @xmath78 ( middle of their range ) and the following three choices of @xmath75 : the borderline cases @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and the middle of the interval @xmath81 .",
    "these correspond to @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "figures [ fig : ode1 ] , [ fig : ode2 ] and [ fig : ode3 ] show the comparison of successive approximations of @xmath20 with the numerical solution of the ordinary differential equation ( [ eq : ode : l ] ) with substituted ( [ eq : s : solution ] ) for @xmath38 .",
    "table [ tab : integral ] shows the successive approximations of the term @xmath64 , where @xmath24 is the integral ( [ eq : integral ] ) and their comparison with the results obtained by integrating the numerical solution of ( [ eq : ode : l ] ) for a bond with maturity @xmath85 year .",
    "finally , table [ tab : s_hat ] shows the successive approximations of @xmath13 , the quantity of interest , compared to its numerically obtained value , again for @xmath85 .    .",

    "we proposed an application of perturbation methods to approximating the variable which is needed to evaluate the analytical approximation formula for bond prices in schaefer and schwartz model @xcite .",
    "we took the difference between the current level of spread and its equilibrium value as a small parameter and constructed expansions which finally led to an expansion of the constant needed in the approximation formula .",
    "coefficients are given in a closed form and our numerical results show a very good approximation power , which suggests that this approach can be successfully used in practical evaluation of the model .",
