    "the atoms are trapped in a transverse optical lattice and thus can be taken into and out of the cavity for local operations in order to circumvent the requirement for individual addressing .",
    "we consider a high q optical cavity couples photons to the certain transitions in atoms whose internal states are shown in fig .",
    "the key parameters describing a cavity qed system are the cavity resonance frequency @xmath0 , the frequency @xmath1 of the atomic transition from the ground state @xmath2 to the excited state @xmath3 .",

    ", the photon passes through pbs2 .",
    "the polarization of the reflected photon is subsequently rotated by hwp2 .",

    "the photon passes hwp3 and pbs4 and is then detected by single - photon detectors .",

    "owing to the well known polarization dependent reflectivity , the transmitted photons are preferentially vertically polarized .",
    "in the ideal case , the vertical polarized photons are perfectly transmitted , while the horizontal polarized ones are partially reflected .",

    "atom 2 trapped in optical lattice b now is moved into the cavity while atom 1 is outside , and the pulse is reflected successively to enter the cavity again , so that the same operation is applied on atom 2 and the pulse .",
