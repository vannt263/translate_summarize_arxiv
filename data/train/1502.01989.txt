    "a probe of galaxy evolution , independent of galaxy flux , is provided by absorption lines in quasar spectra superposed by foreground galaxies along the sightlines , particularly the damped lyman-@xmath3 ( dla ; neutral hydrogen column densities @xmath4 @xmath5 ) and sub - dla ( @xmath6 @xmath5 ; proux et al .",
    "2003 ) absorbers .",
    "dlas and sub - dlas are the primary neutral gas reservoir available for star formation ( e.g. , storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ; proux et al .",
    "2005 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2005 ; noterdaeme et al . 2009 , 2012 ; zafar et al .",
    "furthermore , they offer the most precise element abundance measurements in distant galaxies , independent of electron temperature , complementing the emission - line abundances in lyman - break galaxies ( lbg s ) or star - forming uv selected galaxies ( e.g. , shapley et al .",
    "2004 ; erb et al .",
    "the metallicities , relative abundances , and gas kinematics of dlas / sub - dlas provide unique indicators of the star formation history , regardless of galaxy redshift or morphology . in the era of precision cosmology , the snapshots of galaxy properties offered by dlas / sub - dlas are crucial for constraining the co - moving densities of gas and metals and their evolution ( e.g. , kulkarni et al . 2007 ) .",
    "nearly undepleted elements such as zn and s in dlas / sub - dlas offer direct `` dust - free '' metallicity indicators .",
    "measurements of zn or s abundances exist for many dlas . like dlas , sub - dlas also show damping wings in the h i ly-@xmath3 absorption line profiles and hence allow reliable determinations of the h i column densities .",
    "the ionization corrections for sub - dlas are relatively modest , compared to those for the lyman limit systems ( lls ) ( e.g. , dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "2003 ; meiring et al .",
    "2007 , 2009b ) .",
    "sub - dlas are thus also well - suited for measuring element abundances . however , until recently , most element abundance studies largely ignored sub - dlas due to their lower @xmath7 and the need for high - resolution spectrographs .",
    "further , most earlier studies ignored absorbers at redshifts @xmath8 ( corresponding to @xmath9 of cosmic history ) due to the need for ultraviolet spectra to access the h i ly-@xmath3 line ( for measuring @xmath10 ) and s ii @xmath11 ( for measuring @xmath12 ) at @xmath8 , and zn ii @xmath13 ( for measuring @xmath14 ) at @xmath15 .",
    "most chemical evolution models predict that the mass - weighted mean metallicity of galaxies should rise from @xmath16 solar at @xmath17 to @xmath18 solar at @xmath19 ( e.g. , pei et al .",
    "1999 ; somerville et al . 2001 ; cora et al .",
    "surprisingly , recent studies show that the dla global mean metallicity is only @xmath20 solar even at low redshifts , and does not reach the near - solar value predicted for the global mean metallicity at @xmath19 ( e.g. , kulkarni et al . 2005 , 2007 , 2010 ; proux et al . 2006b ; and references therein ; battisti et al .",
    "a missing metals problem was also noted in high-@xmath21 dlas from star formation rate ( sfr ) estimates based on c ii * absorption ( wolfe et al . 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , after adding up the metal content of known dlas , ly-@xmath3 forest , uv - selected galaxies , and sub - mm galaxies , @xmath22 of the predicted metals at @xmath23 appear to be missing ( e.g. , pettini 2006 ; bouche et al . 2007 ; but see also @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , recent ground - based studies by our group and others have uncovered several near - solar or super - solar metallicity sub - dlas at @xmath24 ( proux et al .",

    "2008 ; dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "2009 ; and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath25 of sub - dlas with zn data at @xmath26 have solar or super - solar metallicity .",
    "moreover , supersolar sub - dlas appear to exist even at @xmath27 ( prochaska et al .",
    "2006 ; som et al .",
    "an extrapolation of the @xmath28 data to lower redshifts suggests that the mean metallicity of sub - dlas is solar at @xmath29 ( e.g. , kulkarni et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ; see also york et al . 2006 ,",
    "prochaska et al . 2006 ) .",
    "in fact , sub - dlas may contribute several times more than dlas to the cosmic metal budget at @xmath30 ( @xcite ) .    despite the above - mentioned developments , several issues remain unanswered regarding the chemical evolution of sub - dlas .",
    "one of the main issues is whether the observed trends are reliable , given the small - number statistics , especially at @xmath31 , where the samples are particularly sparse .",
    "second , the role of ionization needs to be addressed directly for low-@xmath21 sub - dlas .",
    "the kinematics of low-@xmath21 sub - dlas also has yet to be investigated . above all",

    "the cos spectra presented here were acquired as part of the hst program go 12536 .",
    "the observations were obtained with the cos fuv or nuv channels in the time - tag mode with the g130 m or g185 m grating .",
    "each sightline was observed in multiple exposures spanning four offset positions ( fp - pos=1 - 4 ) for each central wavelength setting in order to minimize the effects of fixed - pattern noise in the detector . for phl1226 and phl1598 ,",
    "one exposure each ( for 1412 s and 1462 s , respectively ) was lost due to an error in the fine guidance sensors .",
    "table 2 summarizes the observations .",
    "our main goal was to measure the absorption lines of fe ii , fe iii , s ii , s iii , si  ii , and si iii .",
    "in addition , our settings covered lines of c ii , c ii@xmath1 , n i , n v , o i , o  vi , si  ii@xmath1 , p ii , ar i , mn ii , and/or ni ii for some absorbers .",
    "the presence of multiple lines for most ions helps to remove confusion with ly-@xmath3 forest lines and to correct for saturation effects .",
    "the exposure times were designed using the cos online exposure time calculator and the fuv / nuv fluxes for our target quasars .",
    "our goal was to reach a 3@xmath40 sensitivity of 0.1 solar metallicity in our absorbers . using the h i column density of each absorber , we estimated the s  ii column density corresponding to a 0.1 solar metallicity , and hence the corresponding equivalent width limit needed to detect the s ii @xmath41 line at a 3 @xmath40 level .",
    "we designed the exposure times so as to reach the corresponding signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) needed for each object to reach this limit .",
    "the spectra were reduced and extracted with standard image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) and space telescope science data analysis system ( stsdas ) packages .",
    "the data were processed with calcos ( version 2.19.7 ) during retrieval via the  on the fly reprocessing \" ( otfr ) system .",
    "for phl 1226 and phl 1598 , the otfr - processing included the compromised exposures mentioned above ; therefore these otfr - processed files were not used in further analysis .",
    "the raw data for these two sightlines , after retrieval , were reprocessed without the compromised exposures using calcos .",
    "the pipeline processed raw time - tag data from each exposure into a flat - fielded , background - subtracted , flux- and wavelength - calibrated one - dimensional extracted ( x1d ) spectrum .",
    "( see massa & york 2013 for a detailed description of the data flow through fuv and nuv time - tag spectroscopic pipelines . )",
    "the x1d files corresponding to all the exposures from a single visit were then co - added by the pipeline to produce a single one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the spectra from multiple visits for a sightline ( where applicable ) were then combined using iraf .",
    "the un - binned spectra used for the analysis have dispersions of @xmath42 9.6 m pixel@xmath36 and @xmath42 37 m pixel@xmath36 for fuv and nuv , respectively .",
    "the s / n near the s ii @xmath43 1250 , 1253 , 1259 triplet are in the range @xmath42 7 - 8 pixel@xmath36 for the fuv data and @xmath42 17 - 30 pixel@xmath36 for the nuv data .",
    "the spectra from different segments of the two detectors were continuum - fitted using the iraf  continuum \" task . for all spectra from a given detector segment",
    ", we experimented with continuum fitting using both cubic spline and legendre polynomial functions , and adopted the better fitting function ( judged from the rms of the residuals ) for the continuum fit .",
    "the continuum - normalized spectra were then used for identifying and measuring absorption features at the known sub - dla redshifts .",
    "the equivalent widths of the absorption lines were measured using the package `` specp '' ( developed by d. welty and j. lauroesch ) . the rest - frame",
    "equivalent widths derived from these measurements are listed in table 3 .",
    "the 1@xmath40 errors for the equivalent widths are given as well and include the effect of the photon noise and the uncertainty in continuum placement .",
    "cells marked with an ellipsis represent lines which could not be measured due to one or more of the following : lack of coverage , blending with ly@xmath3 forest lines , very poor s / n due to spectrograph inefficiency at wavelength extremes , or coincidence of the line with artifacts .",
    "column density determinations were performed by fitting multi - component voigt profiles to the observed absorption lines , using the programs vpfit ( version 10.0 ) and fits6p @xcite .",
    "these programs iteratively minimize the @xmath44 residual between the data and the theoretical voigt profiles convolved with the instrumental profile .",
    "our profile fits incorporate the wavelength - dependent line spread functions of cos .",
    "a discussion of our profile - fitting technique can also be found in khare et al .",
    "estimation of the integrated column densities from the absorption profiles was done also via the apparent optical depth ( aod ; see savage & sembach 1991 ) method using the program  specp \" .",
    "determination of integrated column density using the aod method is independent of the velocity structure model and provides a check of the total column densities derived using the multi - component profile fits .",
    "the atomic data for all lines were adopted from morton ( 2003 ) . while a few oscillator strengths have been improved recently ( see , e.g. , kisielius et al .",
    "2014 for s  ii ) , the changes are relatively small ( e.g. , @xmath45 dex for s  ii ) .    for the absorbers toward phl 1226 and",
    "pks 0439 - 433 , our data covered the h i ly-@xmath3 absorption lines . in these cases ,",
    "the h i column densities were estimated using voigt profile fitting .",
    "these voigt profile fits are shown in fig .",
    "1 . our @xmath7 values match within @xmath46 with those estimated from lower resolution hst spectra in past studies ( e.g. , rao et al .",
    "the voigt profile fits to the metal absorption line profiles for the absorbers required multiple components . the moderate spectral resolution and s",
    "/ n of our cos spectra limited the number of components we can resolve .",
    "for each sub - dla , we adopted the minimum number of velocity components that were necessary to explain all the absorption lines observed .",
    "a velocity component for an ion species was included in our fits only if it was consistent with at least two absorption line profiles , but in general , all the velocity components considered were present in most strong line profiles .",
    "the effective doppler parameter ( @xmath47 ) and velocity ( @xmath48 ) values of the components were determined by fitting multiple lines simultaneously . for the strong components ,",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 were determined from weaker and less saturated lines , while for the weaker components , the stronger transitions were used . for each component , @xmath47 and @xmath48 values",
    "were adjusted iteratively until a consistent set of these values , providing the best fit to that component in the different lines , was found .",
    "the uncertainties in the @xmath47 values were @xmath49 , and the uncertainties in the @xmath48 values were consistent with the spectral resolution .",
    "absorption profiles of neutral ( o  i , n  i , ar  i ) , singly ionized ( such as s  ii , si  ii , fe  ii , p  ii , mn  ii , ni  ii , c  ii ) and doubly ionized ( fe  iii , si  iii , s  iii ) metals in a system were fitted using the same set of @xmath47 and @xmath48 values , because these ions showed absorption at common velocities . in a few cases ,",
    "some doubly ionized metals also showed absorption at other velocities , which was fitted with additional velocity components .",
    "the voigt profile fits , obtained using these @xmath47 and @xmath48 values , were used to determine the column densities of various ions in individual components .",
    "if a multiplet was observed ( such as s ii @xmath43 1250 , 1253 , 1259 ; si ii @xmath43 1021 , 1193 , 1260 ; n i @xmath43 1199.6 , 1200.2 , 1200.7 ) the lines were fitted simultaneously . the contribution from si ii ,",
    "as obtained from the typically saturated si ii @xmath50 1193 or si ii @xmath50 1260 ( if the former was not available ) , to the blend between si ii @xmath50 1190.2 and s iii @xmath50 1190.4 was used to obtain an upper limit on the contribution from s iii .",
    "absorption lines from n  v ( @xmath43 1239 , 1243 ) and o  vi ( @xmath43 1032 , 1038 ) , detected in two absorbers in our sample , appear to be wider and show less sub - component structure in comparison with the lower - ion line profiles .",
    "consequently , the velocity structures adopted to fit the n  v and o  vi absorption lines were independent of those adopted for the lower ions .    figs .",

    "tables 4 - 9 list the velocities with respect to the absorber redshifts reported in the literature ( based on measurements of the ly-@xmath3 line ) , doppler parameters , and column densities for each component fitted to the various metal ions for the absorbers .",
    "the column densities in the weaker components that could not be well - constrained due to noise are each marked with an ellipsis in tables 4 - 9 ; their contributions to the total column densities are negligible .",
    "the column densities of individual components were added to derive total column densities , and the uncertainties in the total column densities were estimated by adding in quadrature the uncertainties in the column densities of the individual components .",
    "the total column densities thus determined were compared with the integrated column densities estimated using the aod method and were found to agree closely , as can be seen from tables 10 - 13 .",
    "the uncertainties in the total column densities derived from the profile fits were comparable to the uncertainties in the integrated column densities from the aod method ( which include the effect of photon noise and the uncertainty in continuum placement ) . in case",
    "a line was not detected , the limiting equivalent width was determined from the local s / n , and a corresponding 3@xmath40 column density upper limit was determined , assuming a linear curve of growth . for a saturated line ,",
    "the total column density measurement using the aod method was adopted as the column density lower limit .",
    "we note that , at the spectral resolution and s / n of our cos data , it is difficult to determine the velocity structures of the absorbers with high degree of accuracy .",
    "the velocity structure models adopted in our voigt profile fits are thus approximate and are not meant to give exact kinematic information about the absorbing gas . however ,",
    "as mentioned before , the total column densities derived from our profile fits agree well , within the uncertainties , with the integrated column densities derived via the aod method which is independent of any velocity structure model .",
    "we stress that our main goal is to determine the total element abundances ( combined over all velocity components ) , for which the integrated column densities inferred from our fits as well as aod calculations are adequate .",
    "element abundances were estimated for each absorption system using the total metal column densities ( summed over all the velocity components ) derived from our data and the h i column densities ( from our data if available , or using values published in the literature ) . throughout this paper , we use the standard notation [ x / y ] = log @xmath51 - log  @xmath52 to denote the relative abundances of elements x and y. the reference solar abundances log @xmath52 were adopted from the photospheric values of @xcite .",

    "thus , our values do not suggest a profound odd - even effect between these two elements .",
    "the measured abundances of n are substantially sub - solar .",

    "as noted in those studies , higher redshift sub - dlas appear to follow a [ mn / fe ] vs. metallicity trend that is steeper than that for dlas , and for abundances in the milky way and the small magellanic cloud .",
    "in fact , the [ mn / fe ] value for the sub - dla toward pks 0439 - 433 lies substantially above the [ mn / fe ] vs. metallicity trend for the higher redshift sub - dlas .",
    "finally , we note that while our abundance analysis is based on integrated column densities ( summed over all velocity components ) , there appear to be some variations between different components .",
    "for example , the s ii and p ii profiles in the absorbers toward both phl 1226 and pks 0439 - 433 seem to differ in different components , suggesting a variation of the s / p ratio between the components .",
    "the mn ii and fe ii profiles in the absorber toward pks 0439 - 433 also show differences between different components .",
    "a variation between components is also seen in the n i / n ii ratio in the absorbers toward phl 1226 and pks 0439 - 433 , suggesting a variation in the ionizing radiation field and/or density .",
    "the n i/ o i ratio in the absorber toward phl 1226 also appears to vary between different components , which could suggest nucleosynthetic variations owing to varying stellar populations .",
    "the spectral resolution of our cos data is not sufficient to meaningfully address these component - to - component variations .",
    "observations at higher spectral resolution are essential to address such variations in detail .      in both dla and sub - dla studies ,",
    "abundances are often calculated from a limited number of ions that are observationally accessible .",
    "for example , since the dominant ionization stages of zn and s are usually zn ii and s ii , [ zn / h ] and [ s / h ] are often estimated from zn  ii/ h i and s  ii/ h i , respectively . in principle",
    ", the true abundances could be different , depending on the column densities of the higher ions ( e.g. zn iii , s  iii , h  ii ) .",
    "it is , therefore , important to estimate the extent of these ionization corrections , defined as @xmath114_{total } - [ x_{dominant \\ , ion}/h i]$ ] .",
    "the element abundances in dlas are generally believed to be not much affected by ionization effects , since dlas , due to their high @xmath7 , are expected to cause self - shielding of photons with @xmath115 ev , i.e. photons capable of ionizing h i. on the other hand , lyman limit systems and ( especially ) the lyman - alpha forest are highly ionized owing to their lower h i column densities .",
    "given that the h i column densities of sub - dlas lie in between those of dlas and lyman - limit systems , sub - dlas are likely to contain some ionized gas .",
    "( indeed , as described earlier , strong n ii , n v , and o vi absorption is observed toward two of our sub - dlas . )",
    "this raises the question of whether ionization corrections could be the possible explanation of the high metallicities seen in higher - redshift sub - dlas .",
    "however , several ionization modeling studies of sub - dlas at @xmath116 showed that while these sub - dlas can be significantly ionized , ionization corrections can not explain their high element abundances ; in fact , the ionization correction for zn is positive , i.e. the true [ zn / h ] is even _ higher _ than that estimated from [ zn ii / h i ] ( see , e.g. , meiring et al . 2007 , 2009b ; som et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "we now inspect whether ionization corrections are significant in the @xmath32 sub - dlas .",
    "given that the intergalactic uv radiation field is much less intense at low redshifts ( e.g. , kulkarni & fall 1993 ; scott et al .",
    "2002 ) , the low - redshift sub - dlas may be expected to be less ionized than their higher - redshift counterparts . on the other hand , if sfrs are especially high in these low-@xmath21 sub - dlas , the local radiation field could be stronger .    to investigate the extent of ionization corrections , we performed photoionization model calculations for all the absorbers in our sample using version 13.01 of the plasma simulation code _ cloudy _ ( ferland et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the models assumed the ionizing radiation incident on the sub - dla absorbing gas to be a combination of the intergalactic uv background ( adopted from @xcite and @xcite and evaluated at the absorber redshift ) and a radiation field produced by o / b type stars ( based on a kurucz model stellar spectrum for a temperature of 30,000 k ) , mixed in equal parts .",
    "the inclusion of the stellar component of the ionizing radiation in our models was motivated by suggestions that the contribution from local sources to the ionization of quasar absorbers may not be negligible in comparison with the background ionizing radiation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the radiation fields mentioned above , our simulation includes the cosmic ray background as well as the cosmic microwave background at the absorber redshift .",
    "we note , however , that our models did not include radiation originating in local shocks from white dwarfs , compact binary systems , or supernovae . for each absorber , grids of photoionization models , tailored to match the observed n@xmath117 and the observed metallicity based on n@xmath118 ,",
    "were produced by varying the ionization parameter , defined as @xmath119 ( where @xmath120 is the flux of radiation with h@xmath121 @xmath122 13.6 ev ) , from @xmath123 to 1 .",
    "the simulated column density ratios between various ions were then compared with the observed values to constrain the ionization parameter and estimate ionization corrections . in particular , we used column density ratios of the adjacent ions of the same element ( e.g. , si iii/ si ii ,",
    "s iii / s ii , or fe iii / fe ii ) , as they provide more reliable observational constraints than the ratios involving different elements , which may be affected by differential depletion or intrinsic nucleosynthetic differences .",
    "we note that the shape of the ionizing spectrum strongly influences ionization in the gas and therefore the results of our simulations are sensitive to the assumption for the incident spectrum .",
    "we also note that our models do not use the observed column densities of o vi , since o vi may be largely collisionally ionized .",
    "indeed , in the absorbers toward phl 1226 and pks 0439 - 433 , the column density of o vi implied by our photo - ionization models is about 1/1000 of that observed ; thus , most of the o vi in these absorbers appears to be collisionally ionized .",
    "we caution that our photoionization models are , as is usual in such models , based on several simplifying assumptions .",
    "the estimates of ionization corrections should therefore be treated as indicative , since they are sensitive to various parameters such as the radiation field , cloud geometry , gas density , abundance pattern , etc .",
    "for example , the assumptions of uniform density and radiation field for the different velocity components is likely be too simplistic , given the presence of multi - phase gas seen from a comparison of the higher and lower ions .",
    "however , to obtain more realistic models fitting each component separately , it would be necessary to determine the h i column density in individual velocity components ( e.g. from higher lyman - series absorption lines ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of information in the existing data regarding @xmath7 in individual components , together with the lack of knowledge of the spatial positioning of the gas at various velocity components and their effects on radiative transfer , make it difficult to perform more sophisticated photoionization modeling .",
    "however , as we note in section 4.3.1 , the model results appear to be consistent with the observational constraint on electron density from a si ii fine structure line in at least one absorber where we have column density estimates of si ii@xmath1 and si ii .",
    "we now describe the results of our photo - ionization simulations for the individual systems .",

    "the metallicity gradients show correlations with the galaxy hubble type , bar strength and merger events ( e.g. , kewley et al .",

    "cresci et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have reported ` inverse ' gradients in z@xmath423 galaxies , with the central regions having a lower metallicity than outer regions ( unlike trends in local galaxies ) .",
    "such inverse gradients can result from dilution of the central gas by accretion of primordial gas , as expected in cold gas accretion models ( e.g. , rupke et al .",
    "dla / sub - dlas offer an excellent direct probe of the metallicity gradients in distant galaxies .",
    "this is because the absorption - line metallicity pertains to the gas along the sightline to the background quasar , while the emission - line metallicity in the foreground galaxy ( if known ) refers to the gas near the center of the galaxy .",
    "thus , one can estimate the metallicity gradient in the absorbing galaxy by comparing the absorption - line metallicity and the emission - line metallicity . for the sub - dlas toward phl 1226 and",
