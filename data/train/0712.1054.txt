    "the role of environment in the formation and evolution of galaxies is a topic of much interest in modern astrophysics .",
    "@xcite found that the abundance of early - type galaxies increases in dense environment indicating that environment has an effect on galaxy morphology .",
    "this _ morphology - density relation _ has been further studied by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has been extended to lower density regions and high - redshift clusters @xcite .",
    "there have been several physical mechanisms proposed to explain this relation , such as ram pressure stripping @xcite , tidal forces @xcite , galaxy harassment @xcite , starvation @xcite , and interaction and merging @xcite .",
    "some of these processes involve violent gas dynamics , and hence it is quite likely that environment influences the star formation rate in galaxies @xcite .",
    "the cosmic star formation history itself is also suspected to depend on environment @xcite .",
    "perhaps as hints of these suspicions , galaxy properties such as color , luminosity , and size appear to depend on environment @xcite .",
    "however , the exact physical processes that link between galaxy properties and environment are still far from being clear .",
    "galaxy clusters are the most dense regions in the large - scale universe .",
    "the number density of galaxies in clusters can be several hundred times larger than that of the field .",
    "they are thus ideal laboratories for studying the effect of environment on the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the first galaxy cluster catalogues @xcite were based on the visual inspection of photographic plates .",
    "while these catalogues have been widely adopted , they suffer from many selection effects and spurious detections due to projection effects .",
    "furthermore , the visual inspection of large parts of the sky is very time consuming .",
    "systematic searchers for galaxy clusters are needed to ensure the efficiency and reliability of the cluster detection . among the most popular in the absence of spectroscopic information",
    "were the technique using the early - type galaxy color - magnitude relation @xcite and finding brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first automatic search for optical clusters looking for overdense regions was by @xcite followed by numerous others @xcite .    with the advent of large - area , spectroscopic redshift surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) and two degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) ,",
    "large cosmological volumes with redshift have become available .",
    "we are finally able to systematically search for galaxy clusters in a large volume by measuring the local 3-d number density of galaxies . while the 3-d densities measured based on the spectroscopic database are more powerful than projection - based 2-d searches for delineating the local galaxy distribution , they require a high level of coverage of member galaxies in the spectroscopic survey a priori",
    ". however , even the most up - to - date surveys ( such as the sdss ) show only @xmath270% completeness rate in dense regions , hampering us from measuring the densities accurately . in this paper",
    ", we introduce an improved method for finding galaxy clusters by measuring local densities using both spectroscopic and _ photometric _ data , and provide a new catalogue of the clusters we have found .",
    "we assume cosmological parameters @xmath3 , and @xmath4 throughout this paper , and all distances are comoving .",
    "the sdss is performing a survey to cover a quarter of the whole sky .",
    "the imaging survey of the sdss dr5 contains 215 million objects in 8000 @xmath5 .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic survey mapped 5740 @xmath5 obtaining about a million spectra of which 674,749 objects are classified as galaxies .",
    "the galaxy redshifts provided make it possible to study 3-d structure of galaxy distribution .",
    "the sdss photometric pipeline provides several kinds of magnitudes . for galaxy colors",
    ", we use the ` modelmags ` as they provide unbiased colors regardless of any color gradients . for galaxy luminosities ,",
    "we use ` petromags ` as these are a better estimate of the total luminosity @xcite .",
    "we also apply a k - correction as described in @xcite and correct for galactic extinction with the @xcite values provided by the sdss pipeline .",
    "we use the sdss dr5 both photometric and spectroscopic data . for the galaxies with spectra",
    ", we extract _ all types of galaxies _ in the range @xmath1 and having @xmath6 @xcite . at @xmath7",
    ", @xmath8 corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath9 . in order to create a volume - limited sample and",
    "so avoid biases with redshift , we cut at this absolute magnitude .    for galaxies without spectra , we select all galaxies with @xmath10 to have the same apparent magnitude cut as the spectroscopic data .",
    "its faint limit comes from the sdss spectroscopic survey limit , and the bright limit is from the fact that the objects of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are almost always stars rather than galaxies .",
    "popular methods to measure galaxy local densities include a simple estimation of spatial number density in a certain radius and the distance to the _ n_th nearest galaxy .",
    "the number density , however , can not tell us about the concentration status which is critical for studying dynamical evolution , while using the _",
    "n_th nearest galaxy can be biased by local density fluctuations .",
    "thus , in addition to the number density , the spatial separation between galaxies can be taken into account as well to provide additional information .",
    "for example , closer neighbors can be weighted more than distant galaxies .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter s06 ) introduced such a weighting scheme with a gaussian filter .",
    "the s06 scheme considers neighboring galaxies in the ellipsoid defined by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the searching distance criterion , @xmath15 is the projected distance and @xmath16 is the line - of - sight distance , all in mpc , to a neighboring galaxy .",
    "it allows all the galaxies within the ellipsoid to be counted for measuring the density .",
    "the @xmath17 factor is a simple compensation for `` the finger - of - god '' effect due to the peculiar motion and is estimated by counting the number of galaxies @xmath18 within the sphere of radius @xmath14 as : @xmath19 where @xmath18 is capped at 10 .",
    "hence , this can scale along the radial direction up to a factor of 3 .",
    "density measures by adopting a fixed volume in comoving space can lead to sampling vastly different volumes in the field and in clusters due to the stretching of the line of sight direction by the finger - of - god effect .    the density parameter to each member galaxy based on the spectroscopic data is calculated as @xmath20    \\label{rho_g2}\\ ] ] by summing up for all the members within the search ellipsoid . the target galaxy is not included in the density summation .",
    "our algorithm estimates the local density with surrounding galaxies in a relatively large area and thus minimizes local effects .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to improve the density measurement scheme of s06 by adding photometric member candidates and build on the s06 algorithm to design an effective cluster search method .      since we do not have the line - of - sight information on the photometric member galaxies , we first measure the 2-d densities for our spectroscopic galaxy samples ignoring the line - of - sight information .",
    "we first define an ellipsoid as in s06 : @xmath21 we choose @xmath22mpc because it optimizes the search for the density peak and the brightest cluster galaxy of the cluster .",
    "for @xmath23 we adopt the distance corresponding to three times the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "note that @xmath23 is used only for selecting member galaxies but not for the 2-d density measurement .",
    "readers are referred to  3.5 for more details .",
    "galaxies within the ellipsoid are regarded as member galaxies of the cluster .",
    "then the new 2-d density @xmath24 for the spectroscopic members is :    @xmath25    \\label{rho_g1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22mpc .      .",
    "the dots with rectangles are galaxies covered by the sdss spectroscopic survey and the crosses are the missed ones .",
    "the completeness rate for this cluster is only 55% in this field of view and 65% within 1mpc radius from the cluster center .",
    "this figure illustrates the problem of fiber collisions in dense environments . ]",
    "the sdss spectroscopic survey tries to cover galaxies as completely as possible with a tiling algorithm @xcite . however , its selection scheme can leave some galaxies unobserved due to fiber collisions .",
    "figure [ a2670 ] shows the extreme case of abell2670 which shows only 65% of spectroscopic coverage rate within the 1mpc radius from the cluster center .",
    "this effect is generally worse for denser regions because the fiber collision problem is obviously worse in the more crowded regions .",
    "we estimate the spectroscopic completeness , that is , the number fraction of galaxies covered by the sdss dr5 spectroscopic survey , to be @xmath26 for rich clusters . an independent study has also reported that @xmath27 of true brightest cluster galaxies are missed by the spectroscopic survey @xcite .",
    "the `` incompleteness '' of the spectroscopic survey causes a problem in measuring the densities of galaxies in dense regions .",
    "we attempt to alleviate this by further considering photometric data .",
    "early - type galaxies in clusters have a tight correlation between their optical colors and luminosity , known as the color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) .",
    "the cmr was first observed by @xcite and is often reported to be universal within errors @xcite .",
    "based on these assumptions , we can select candidate cluster members even though they do not have redshift because galaxies on the cmr have a high likelihood of belonging to the cluster .",
    "thus , we find the slope and scatter of the cmr in order to select `` photometric members '' . for small clusters , the slope of the cmr can be difficult to achieve .",
    "hence , we construct an empirical cmr by stacking galaxies that are members of 20 typical clusters determined by their redshifts .",
    "we do this for five redshift bins with @xmath28 , and an example is shown in figure  [ cmr ] .",
    "a linear fit with @xmath29 clipping is iterated until the number of galaxies on the cmr remains constant .",
    "the galaxies residing on the cmr @xmath30 in @xmath31 color are selected as `` photometric members '' .",
    "we compute the 2-d photometric density @xmath32 following eq .",
    "[ rho_g1 ] using only the photometric members .    .",
    "the gray - solid line shows a linear fit after @xmath33 clipping until the number of galaxies on the cmr becomes constant and the dashed lines show the scatter ( the gray - solid line @xmath34 in @xmath31 color ) . the vertical dot - dashed line is a absolute magnitude cut in our data selection . ]    the total density @xmath35 of a galaxy is calculated by combining the spectroscopic and photometric density parameters : @xmath36 in the process of combining @xmath24 and @xmath32 we are losing the line - of - sight information and our density measures are projected into only two dimensions ; but , our method still provides improved density measures as will be demonstrated in  4 . through our follow - up spectroscopic observations .",
    "when we determine whether a particular galaxy without redshift belongs to a cluster as described in this section , we assume that the galaxy is at the redshift of the cluster and apply the same absolute magnitude cut as discussed in  2 .",
    "we have attempted improving our local density measure further by applying a galaxy luminosity weight ( i.e. weighting more luminous galaxies more ) but found no significant difference .",
    "hence , we have decided to ignore it .",
    "we expect that the cmr to be effective for finding cluster member galaxies but that it may still suffer from the projection effect of background and foreground objects .",
    "hence , we test its efficiency .",
    "we restrict the test on the spectroscopic data only , because only with redshift we can determine whether a particular galaxy is a cluster member or not , that is , for a convincingly high confidence .",
    "besides , we use early - type galaxies alone for this test as our cmr method works only for them . in order to select early - type galaxies ( etgs ) , we use the morphological index _",
    "fracdev _ from the sdss pipeline , which shows the weight of the de vaucouleurs profile in the two - component profile fit with the devaucouleurs and exponential profiles .",
    "we apply the highly conservative @xmath37-band @xmath38 cut , and the galaxies selected are highly likely to be early type . using the spectroscopic members meeting the same @xmath39 criterion , we check the validity of our scheme defining the following two cmr - related quantities . @xmath40",
    "the `` cmr completeness '' is a measure of the number of the early - type cluster members that also sit on the cmr .",
    "the `` cmr purity '' tells us the fraction of galaxies selected by the cmr method that are indeed early - type cluster members .",
    "figure  [ cmr_test ] presents the cmr completeness and purity of our clusters as a function of density .",
    "the cmr completeness is around 90% meaning that 90% of the early - type ( by @xmath39 ) member galaxies indeed sit on the cmr .",
    "the purity is 7085% meaning that only 7085% of the galaxies on the cmr are early - type ( by @xmath39 ) members .",
    "the rest may be background or foreground galaxies .",
    "exact values of these parameters modestly depend on the @xmath39 criterion adopted , but on the whole both parameters show high values validating our scheme .",
    "the sdss dr5 photometric data includes about a million galaxies in the magnitude range described in  2 .",
    "searching for clusters through the entire data set would require an exhaustive amount of effort .",
    "so we begin our cluster search first by estimating the local density of @xmath41 members and identify about 7000 galaxies with high density measures as candidate cluster positions . for this selection we use 3-d spectroscopic density parameter ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "we then select all the photometric and spectroscopic galaxies within a 2 mpc radius from the cluster center candidate galaxies and estimate their total 2-d local density with both the spectroscopic and photometric members for all galaxies in this radius .    with these 2-d spectro - photometric density measurements",
    ", we find the galaxy with the highest density in the area of a 2 mpc circle and @xmath43 .",
    "the highest density galaxy in a local area is defined as the maximum - density galaxy ( hereafter mdg ) . as the mdg resides at the densest part of the selected volume ,",
    "we define it as the cluster center and declare it a cluster if the @xmath35 of an mdg is greater than 4.0 which roughly corresponds to a cluster velocity dispersion of @xmath44 .",
    "and the purity is 7085% with an apparent density dependence .",
    "the high values of these parameters validate our cmr technique . ]",
    "we @xmath45 that the mdg should be close to the cluster center and coincide with the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ; @xcite ) .",
    "we compared the projected separation of bcgs to mdgs and found that they do not always coincide , however .",
    "we assume that a good cluster search scheme should identify mdgs as bcgs as well , and thus we vary the member search radius ( the short axis of the ellipsoid ) hoping to minimize the separation .",
    "figure  [ bcg_separation ] shows the separation between mdgs and bcgs .",
    "the mean and error bars reflect the large scatter in the sample .",
    "the median is a better estimate of the typical distance and shows a convergence towards a lower value of search radius .",
    "but too small a value of the search radius would miss too many member galaxies in the density measurement and be dominated by local density fluctuations .",
    "the typical virial radius of our clusters is 0.5mpc in the 2-d projection , and a substantial fraction ( @xmath46% ) of clusters have a virial radius greater than 0.5mpc and extend beyond 1mpc . considering this ,",
    "we have chosen 1mpc as our search radius .",
    "it should be noted that our search using spectroscopic data and the cmr is liable to missing clusters that are dominated by blue , starforming galaxies , if any .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we perform a cross - matching between existing catalogues and ours .",
    "the matching criteria are 2mpc in the projected radius and @xmath43 . when the known clusters do not have redshift ( e.g. , zwicky clusters ) , we just match them within 2mpc radius in the sky .",
    "each cluster in our catalogue is matched with other catalogues separately .",
    "the clusters that are detected in our method are generally in the existing catalogues ( see table [ recovery ] ) .",
    "most rich clusters are matched with abell or zwicky clusters and this implies that the new algorithm using mdgs successfully finds rich galaxy clusters .",
    "for those clusters in the existing catalogues which include redshift , we can check the rate at which our method recovers clusters known previously .",
    "some abell clusters have redshifts and the c4 catalogue clusters always do @xcite",
    ". we cross - check our clusters against the abell and c4 clusters that are in the sdss area and in our redshift range .",
    "128 out of 162 abell clusters with redshifts and 300 out of 458 c4 clusters are detected in our method , corresponding to detection rates of 79% and 66% , respectively . if we lower the @xmath35 cut for `` clusters '' from 4.0 to 1.0 we would find 89% and 95% of abell and c4 clusters , respectively .",
    "for example , by using a @xmath47 cut , we can recover additional 18 abell clusters .",
    "however , such a low value of cut ( @xmath48 ) would also find significantly more cluster candidates ( 3,959 ) many of which may be false detection .",
    "our density measures with @xmath49 cut are in general based on about 7 member galaxies . besides , when only a small number of galaxies are used for density measurement , the density measures become less reliable , too .",
    "since our goal is to construct a database of galaxy clusters with @xmath50 and hence reliable density measures , we think our @xmath51 cut is a good compromise .",
    "however , we admit that this choice is still somewhat arbitrary and by using this cut we are neglecting smaller clusters . in this",
    "regard , our 924 cluster candidates represent a robust sample of relatively - rich clusters .",
    "the galaxy clusters that were known to abell but missed by our method are mostly due to the @xmath35 cut as mentioned above .",
    "in addition , our method missed 9 abell clusters which are mainly composed of relatively faint galaxies that do not make it to our volume - limited sample .",
    "two abell clusters were missed because they are found by our method to be parts of larger clusters , just like the m87 and m49 groups in virgo cluster .",
    "five additional clusters were missed due to various minor reasons : e.g. , mismatch in the redshift of the center galaxy of a cluster , mismatch in the position of the center galaxy of a cluster , and so on .",
    "we compare our new catalogue to the c4 cluster catalogue @xcite .",
    "while we use the density @xmath35 to represent the richness of a cluster , the c4 catalogue provides the number of galaxies within various radii .",
    "we compare our density measures within 1mpc , @xmath35 , with the c4 richness ( c4 parameter wmag1000 ) in figure  [ c4_richness ] .",
    "the match is reasonably good but shows a large scatter .",
    "the systematic difference in vertical scale has a couple of critical origins .",
    "most importantly , our limiting magnitude , @xmath52 , is somewhat brighter than that of c4 ( -19.9 ) .",
    "secondly , our density is not a simple count of galaxies but weighted by the distance from the cluster center .",
    "thirdly , our method , unlike c4 , includes additional photometric member candidates .",
    "fourthly , our choice for the search radius ( 1mpc ) is smaller than that of c4 ( @xmath53mpc ) .",
    "lastly , the member - search volume in c4 is a cylinder with a line - of - sight length corresponding to four times the velocity dispersion , while ours is an ellipsoid with a length that is 3 times the velocity dispersion .",
    "the large scatter is mainly a result of two effects . to begin with",
    ", the position of the central galaxy of a cluster can be different mainly because our method includes photometric member candidates .",
    "in addition , the redshift of a cluster can also be different .",
    "we notice some difference in the velocity dispersion measured as well , which also contributes to the scatter .",
    "( listed in table 1 ) and y - axis shows ngal ( wmag 1000 ) from the c4 catalogue .",

    "the small black dots show the density measures of our clusters based only on the sdss database .",

    "<S> recent large - scale galaxy spectroscopic surveys , such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , enable us to execute a systematic , relatively - unbiased search for galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> such surveys make it possible to measure the 3-d distribution of galaxies but are hampered by the incompleteness problem due to fiber collisions . in this study </S>",
    "<S> we aim to develop a density measuring technique that alleviates the problem and derives densities more accurately by adding additional cluster member galaxies that follow optical color - magnitude relations for the given redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the new density measured with both spectroscopic and photometric data shows a good agreement with apparent information on cluster images and is supported by follow - up observations . by adopting this new method , </S>",
    "<S> a total of 924 @xmath0 galaxy clusters are found from the sdss dr5 database in the redshift range @xmath1 , of which 212 are new . </S>",
    "<S> local maximum - density galaxies successfully represent cluster centers . </S>",
    "<S> we provide the cluster catalogue including a number of cluster parameters . </S>"
