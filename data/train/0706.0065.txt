    "monte carlo simulations , based on metropolis sampling algorithm , have immensely contributed to our understanding of a variety of complex physical systems and their thermodynamic behavior  @xcite . yet",
    ", they are also known to be computationally inefficient in situations where low entropy microstates of a canonical system are to be sampled in sufficient numbers in order to obtain accurate estimates of relevant thermodynamic parameters .",
    "employing suitable biassing rules that favor these microstates , especially in irreversible growth models , does not ensure a neat solution to this problem because the associated weights could wildly fluctuate leading to large errors .",
    "wang - landau flat histogram algorithm  @xcite is a recently proposed dynamical method for efficiently sampling such microstates and hence , for accurately computing the density of states ( dos ) of the system under study .",
    "a particularly interesting idea , highlighted recently by prellberg and krawczyk  @xcite in the context of self avoiding walk ( saw )  @xcite , is to recognize the dos as simply the average of weights associated with all monte carlo attempts to sample the required microstates ; acceptance of a microstate depends on how the associated weight compares with the average and is implemented in such a way that the energy histogram becomes progressively flatter . in this step - by - step growth model , also known as the kinetic growth walk ( kgw )  @xcite , the weight associated with a microstate ( a walk configuration ) is the product of single step weights which are , in fact , the local _ microcanonical _ partition functions or equivalently the number of available directions for the individual steps . since the model is athermal",
    ", it is intuitively clear that the average weight could provide an estimate of the dos .",
    "if , on the other hand , the individual steps are sampled on the basis of the _ energy _ being gained by the walk , their associated weights are customarily taken to be equal to the inverse of the corresponding step probabilities ; again the configurational average of their products could lead to an estimate of the dos .",
    "an interesting alternative is to set the single step weights equal to the local _ canonical _ partition functions , a straightforward generalization of the athermal case . assuming that the configurational average of their products over all monte carlo attempts leads to an estimate of the _ canonical _ partition function , it is not necessary that it would be a sum of terms that are factorizable into the ( athermal ) dos and the corresponding boltzmann factor .    in this paper",
    ", we clarify this point by using interacting growth walk ( igw ) model  @xcite , which is a finite temperature generalization of the kgw .",
    "we explain how the _ canonical _ partition function for walks of given length is exactly equal to the average of the products of local partition functions associated with all possible walk configurations including those that have failed to grow to the full length . in this case , we show that the density of states ( dos ) can not be factored out of the canonical partition function .",
    "further , we present monte carlo results for igws on the diamond lattice and show that the set of igw configurations available for study is temperature - dependent , in contrast to the athermal set of kgw configurations , even though the weighted averages lead to the expected thermodynamic behavior of saw .",
    "consider a saw configuration , @xmath0 , made up of an ordered set of @xmath1 directions , @xmath2 , taken consecutively on a regular lattice of coordination number @xmath3 .",
    "recognizing the fact that self - avoidance for the current step is a non - local requirement involving the entire walk configuration , we denote by @xmath4 the number of acceptable or available directions for the @xmath5 step .",
    "the walk proceeds further only if the direction chosen for the next step is acceptable ; it is trapped at the @xmath6 step and will not grow further , if @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "local acceptability criteria decide the length and configuration of the walk .",
    "it is quite likely that an acceptable step leads to a site some of whose nearest neighbours are sites through which the walk configuration has already grown .",
    "let @xmath8 be the number of such non - bonded nearest neighbours , also called _ contacts _ , encountered by the @xmath5 step in the direction @xmath9 . clearly , the total number of _ contacts _ in the configuration @xmath10 is the sum of _ contacts _ made by each step in the walk . by assigning a quantum of energy ,",
    "say @xmath11 , to each of these _ contact_s , we will be able to treat the walk as a thermal object .",
    "there are @xmath3 possible directions for the first step taken from an arbitrary lattice site , called the origin ; each of these directions leads to @xmath12 possible directions for the second step , and so on until the first @xmath13 steps of the walk are taken without making any contact .",
    "the total number of possible configurations identified upto @xmath13 steps is therefore @xmath14 .",
    "some of these configurations would make _ contacts _",
    ", for the first time , at the @xmath15 step .",
    "for example , @xmath16 and @xmath17 on honecomb , square and triangular lattices respectively .",
    "subsequently , each of these contact making configurations would have , say , @xmath18 directions for the @xmath19 step .",
    "some of these growing configurations will be geometrically trapped at the @xmath20 step and hence can not grow further .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath21 at which trapping occurs for the first time depends on the lattice on which the walk is grown .",
    "for example , min@xmath22 and @xmath23 on honeycomb , square and triangular lattices respectively .",
    "if we map out all the configurations till they are either geometrically trapped or have grown to their full specified length , say @xmath24 , we have the _ genealogical tree _ , @xmath25 , of saws of length less than or equal to @xmath24 .",
    "clearly , any trapped @xmath26-step saw configuration ( @xmath27 ) , realizable by a growth algorithm , is a _ branch _ of the _ genealogical tree_. it flowcharts all possible outcomes of a growth algorithm and is , in fact assumed to be made up of all possible @xmath24-step saws as well as all possible trapped @xmath26-step saws ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the shortest branch of the tree is of length @xmath21 , at which length the growth of the branch is stopped on a given lattice . counting the number of branches of length @xmath26 in the tree , @xmath25 , for all @xmath26 in range @xmath28 $ ] could provide a complete description of the treeit is of interest to know whether a growth algorithm that uses local growth rules to trace out a branch can estimate , in particular , the number of branches of length @xmath24 , which is equal to the total number of @xmath24-step saws , @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath30 be the probability of growing a @xmath26-step walk , or equivalently of realizing a @xmath26-step branch of the genealogical tree @xmath25 , at an inverse temperature @xmath31 . since any branch of this tree is a either a realizable saw configuration of length equal to @xmath24 or",
    "a realizable trapped saw configuration of length less than @xmath24 , and _ vice versa _",
    ", we have the normalization for their growth probabilities : @xmath32 since @xmath25 ( @xmath33 ) does not have a branch of length less than @xmath21 , @xmath34 and hence the summation is from @xmath21 onwards .    in terms of the single step probabilities , @xmath35 , we can write @xmath36 where the prefactor @xmath37^{-1}$ ] is the probability of growing the initial segment of length @xmath38 , which does not make any contact during its growth and hence is athermal .    single step probabilities , @xmath35 , are in general assumed to be temperature dependent so as to take into account the possibility of bias due to contacts .",
    "however , in the case of kgw , it is temperature - independent and is given by @xmath39 it is locally normalized over all acceptable steps . in the case of igw , on the other hand , @xmath35 is a temperature - dependent locally normalized jump probability for the @xmath40 step in the direction @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of available sites for the @xmath40 step and , without loss of generality , @xmath11 may be set equal to unity .",
    "growing a saw of length more than the minimum @xmath13 steps with history - dependent , local step - probabilities has an important consequence - namely , that its growth probability , @xmath44 , will not be the same as that obtained by growing the same configuration in the reverse order .",
    "the reason for this is the different local growth environments in which the walk has to sample its next step .",
    "one way of quantifying and correcting for this is to assign a _",
    "canonical _ weight to the @xmath40 step in the direction @xmath41 of a growing configuration @xmath45 , if acceptable ( _ i.e. , _ if @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 it may be recognized immediately as grassberger s perm - b weight  @xcite for igw and is , of course , zero for a step that is not acceptable .",
    "these weights assigned to the individual steps , in turn , define a _",
    "canonical _ weight that can be assigned to an @xmath24-step configuration , @xmath48 : @xmath49 where the prefactor @xmath14 is due to the fact that the walk does not make any contacts for the first @xmath13 steps , and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the total number of contacts in an @xmath24-step configuration @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath53 , by definition , for walks of lengths less than @xmath24 .",
    "the average value of @xmath54 , taken over the entire genealogical tree @xmath25 , is given by @xmath55 the last identity is due to the normalization of the growth probabilities given by eq.(1 ) , as well as due to @xmath53 , by definition , for walks of length less than @xmath24 . from eq.(7 ) , it is clear that @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the _",
    "canonical partition function _ for @xmath24-step interacting self avoiding walks ( isaw )  @xcite . in other words , averaging the canonical weights , defined in eq.(7 ) , over the entire _ genealogical tree _ , @xmath25 , gives the exact value of @xmath57 .    because mapping the entire genealogical tree , @xmath25 , is quite a formidable task for large values of @xmath24 ,",
    "monte carlo methods are employed for estimating the average value of @xmath58 : @xmath59 where the summation is over all successful @xmath24-step walks and @xmath60 is the total number of attempts made to generate them . with the probability of growing a configuration implicitly taken care by the algorithmic rules ,",
    "this equation may be recognized as an equivalent of eq.(8 ) ; the monte carlo estimate of @xmath58 will approach that given by eq.(10 ) as the number of attempts , @xmath60 , becomes sufficiently large ( _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath61 ) .",
    "it must be noted that the identity , eq.(10 ) , holds good whatever be the growth walk used .",
    "for example , the single - step probability of kgw is temperature - independent ( eq.(3 ) ) whereas that of igw is temperature - dependent ( eq.(4 ) ) , yet either of them could be used for estimating @xmath57 . in order to understand the basic difference between them , we first rewrite eq.(9 ) in the form , @xmath62 where the inner summation is over all the @xmath24-step configurations that make @xmath63 _ contacts _ and @xmath64 is the maximum number of _ contacts _ an @xmath24-step configuration will make .",
    "a comparison with eq.(10 ) immediately leads to the identification , @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the total number of configurations making @xmath63 _ contacts _ , or equivalently the density of states ( dos ) .",
    "this begs the question whether a term - by - term identification is also implied .    in the case of kgw ,",
    "the weights being temperature - independent , we have the identity , @xmath67 that leads to the factorizability of the individual terms @xmath68 , namely , @xmath69 in other words , term - by - term identification in eq.(14 ) is meaningful for kgw because the athermally generated configurations are assigned appropriate boltzmann factors _ a posteriori_.    on the contrary , the probability of generating an igw configuration is temperature - dependent , and from eqns .",
    "( 4 - 7 ) , we have the product , @xmath70 where @xmath71-function ensures that the configuration @xmath52 has @xmath63 _ contacts_. it is clearly not factorizable into temperature - independent ( dos ) and temperature - dependent terms , like in the case of kgw ( eqs.(15 and 16 ) ) .",
    "yet , eqs.(10 and 12 ) ensure that the configurational average of igw weights ( or equivalently , the perm - b weights ) provides an estimate of the canonical partition function and hence can also be used for computing the energy fluctuation as a function of temperature .",
    "a monte carlo estimate of @xmath68 follows from eq.(11 ) : @xmath72 in the case of kgw , the weights are temperature - independent and we immediately have a monte carlo estimate of the density of states , @xmath66 , from eq.(15 ) : @xmath73 in the case of igw , however , such a direct estimate of the dos is not possible .    a dynamical algorithm for estimating @xmath74 at any given step @xmath75 has recently been proposed by prellberg and krawczyk  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath76 be the canonical weight assigned to the @xmath77 configuration , @xmath10 , at the @xmath5 step .",
    "this configuration is either allowed to grow further or is terminated depending on how its weight compares with the updated average , @xmath78/(s+1)$ ] : @xmath79 since @xmath74 is an estimate of the canonical partition function , @xmath80 , the parameter @xmath81 could be considered as the boltzmann factor @xmath82 , where @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "hence , _ without enrichment _ , eq.(20 ) is a simple metropolis criterion that is also physically meaningful for the growth walks .",
    "using this simple metropolis criterion , without enrichment , we have estimated , and shown in fig.1 , normalized fluctuations in the number of contacts per monomer , @xmath84 , for fairly short igws of length upto @xmath85 steps on a diamond lattice . as the walk length increases , the peak shifts towards the expected value , @xmath86  @xcite , indicating thereby that the specific heat data are not sensitive to the factorizability of the canonical weights associated with kgw and igw respectively .",

    ", width=384,height=336 ]    large fluctuations in the weights could be a severe problem , as illustrated in the inset of fig.1 for example .",
    "in fact , sample loss due to pruning outweighs the reduction in loss due to attrition at higher values of @xmath31 ; consequently , reduction in the effective sample size may also contribute to wild fluctuation in the weights .",
    "the data presented in the inset correspond to igws grown at @xmath91 ; it took about three hours of pentium iv @xmath92 ghz processor time to collect them .",
    "while the unweighted variance per monomer increases monotonically with the length of the walk , the weighted ones fluctuate wildly ; nevertheless , a definite trend could still be discerned by a simple adjacent averaging of the weighted data .     at @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
