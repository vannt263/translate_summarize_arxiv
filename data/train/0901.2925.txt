    "recently there has been a series of experimental results suggesting that we may have indirectly detected dark matter ( dm ) within our galaxy .",
    "the combination of the positron fraction measured by the pamela experiment  @xcite and the atic / ppb - bets experiments  @xcite , have led to a compelling picture of dm being responsible for a new population of positrons at high energies .",
    "these excesses , if confirmed , could in principle have alternative explanations through either refining our understanding of charged particle propagation within our galaxy , or by identifying new astrophysical sources of positrons coming , for instance , from pulsars  @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing therefore , that new experimental data expected in the near future could not only confirm or contradict those results , but also allow us to possibly determine the physics behind these excesses .",
    "furthermore , in the case of dm , such experiments could strongly constrain the various dm models .    broadly speaking ,",
    "the plethora of dm models bifurcate into either annihilating  @xcite or decaying  @xcite dm . in this paper",
    "we choose to focus on the former possibility as being the source of the electronic excesses .",
    "the above experiments then place strong restrictions on the models , so we adopt the following phenomenological inputs as constraints :    * there is an excess in the flux ratio @xmath0 observed by the pamela experiment extending to _ at least _ 100 gev  @xcite .",
    "* there is an excess in the atic / ppb - bets experiments for the flux of charged electrons and positrons , @xmath1 , extending to energies of @xmath2 gev  @xcite .",
    "* there is no excess observed by the pamela experiment in the antiproton flux  @xcite .",
    "* in the absence of large local overdensity in the dm distribution ( boost factor ) , the annihilation cross section in our galaxy needs to be @xmath3 times larger than a standard thermal wimp .",
    "these facts are not easily reconciled .",
    "the last of these assumptions follows from the large measured rates combined with the higher mass scale indicated by the atic / ppb - bets anomaly . for the case of a wimp dm , a large enhancement of the cross section",
    "is needed  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a large boost factor ( bf ) is required .",
    "however , such a possibility seems unlikely in light of the results from n - body simulations@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a model must prefer annihilation into leptonic final states so that the antiproton fraction is not overpopulated .",
    "there has been a recent explosion in model building that attempts to incorporate the necessary ingredients to explain these excesses . typically , these models explain the electronic activity by either assuming a symmetry that forbids hadronic production , or otherwise postulating an intermediate light state that can only decay into light leptons due to kinematics .",
    "most of these studies have either stopped at the heuristic level of explanation , or attempted quantitatively only to postdict certain experiments .",
    "it is therefore desirable to consider a larger set of experimental data in order to better establish the correct model - building direction .",
    "we attempt to address the following questions :    * given a model that can explain the pamela and atic / ppb - bets data , what are the experimental bounds arising from other experiments ? * what are the viable classes of models ? * for these models , what are the implications for upcoming experiments ?    the most logical additional signature which has not been entirely explored is the one coming from photons . whenever there are charged particles in the final state there will be additional photons radiated , leading to a model independent signature  @xcite .",
    "additional sources of photons may contribute depending on the specific details of the model .",
    "recently there have been a few papers  @xcite that have studied the bounds from high energy photons in models that explain the excesses .",
    "the authors of  @xcite reached the conclusion that for most dark matter density profiles , experimental results rule out the possibility of annihilating dm as an explanation of the excesses . in",
    "@xcite the case where dm directly annihilates into a pair of sm leptons was studied .",
    "we reach a similar conclusion to  @xcite , that such models disagree with the experimental data collected for high energy photons . in  @xcite models where dm annihilates through a light state and then into leptons was studied . in our paper",
    "we focus on these models and reach a different conclusion than the authors of  @xcite . while we find there exists some tension between models that explain atic / ppb - bets and high energy photons , they are not ruled out by an order of magnitude .",
    "we also include several effects that have not yet been studied in the literature , that can ameliorate this tension , such as dark sector radiation .    to study the implications of the present experimental data , we construct a module that incorporates many of the required features necessary for a model to explain the excesses .",
    "this module has several parameters that allow us to interpolate between different classes of models .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows . for annihilating dm scenarios that explain both pamela and atic / ppb - bets :    * rather generically",
    ", such models are in tension with constraints from high - energy photons .",
    "* photons are more constraining than the antiprotons measurements .",
    "in particular , models that produce antiprotons and still fit the pamela data in many cases produce too many photons to be consistent with the measurements . *",
    "the tension is not sufficient to exclude all models .",
    "however , it requires a factor of order @xmath4 that may arise from various sources , e.g. a local boost factor or a less cuspy dm profile .",
    "we find a number of interesting implications based on these results .",
    "upcoming experiments have the power to exclude the full region of parameter space , for models that explain the atic / ppb - bets excesses with annihilating dm . from this point of view",
    "decaying dm models are attractive because they generate fewer photons at the center of the galaxy",
    ". models of annihilating dm that do not seek to explain the atic / ppb - bets are also viable , and can be tested with several ongoing experiments .",
    "in particular , we stress the importance of the currently running experiment , fermi @xcite , for helping determine the underlying nature of these excesses .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : udm ] we construct a dm module that enables us to investigate the parameter space of models .",
    "we then calculate the particle physics input for the relevant experiments , namely the injection spectrums for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in section  [ sec :",
    "ai ] we discuss the astrophysical inputs for our study .",
    "we review the methods used in this study for propagating the various particles from their source to earth .",
    "additionally , we further discuss the experimental inputs that we use , and comment on many of the uncertainties associated in calculating the fluxes for them . in section  [ sec : pb ] we present the resulting astrophysical fluxes calculated from our particle physics module .",
    "we demonstrate how the various particle physics and astrophysics parameters affect the predicted fluxes for @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : imp ] we discuss the implications and interpretations of the regions of parameter space that we find to be consistent with the experiments studied . in appendix",
    "[ app : box ] we discuss the so called  leaky box \" approximation which we use to estimate the positron background flux .",
    "we are interested in understanding the bounds and predictions for characteristic dm models that could be used to explain the excesses observed . in this work",
    "we do not focus on the bounds for a particular model nor are we completely model independent .",
    "instead , we construct a module that contains the most important components that we identify from the particle physics perspective .",
    "this module can then be appropriately recast to reflect the predictions from a wide array of models that have been , and inevitably will be , built .",
    "we construct the dark matter module loosely in accord with the unified dark matter model of arkani - hamed _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "this model offers the intriguing possibility to describe not only the pamela and atic / ppb - bets excesses , but also the integral  @xcite and dama  @xcite excesses simultaneously .",
    "we treat  @xcite as representative of a class of ideas , and choose to incorporate those features of  @xcite that are relevant to studying the experimental consequences for indirect searches in the high energy @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels .",
    "the components we choose to include in our module for explaining the excesses are the following .",
    "we assume there are heavy dm particle(s ) , @xmath9(s ) , that are charged under some  dark \" gauge group , and possibly the sm electroweak ( ew ) gauge groups as well .",
    "additionally , the dark gauge group is broken and therefore the sector consists of light gauge bosons which we collectively refer to as @xmath10 .",
    "the light gauge bosons are required for two reasons : on the one hand , they allow for a kinematical explanation for the electron but no antiproton excess measured by the above experiments .",
    "on the other hand , they play part in the sommerfeld mechanism that can enhance the usual thermal wimp cross - section to the required rate today . with this in mind",
    ", we allow the @xmath9 s to annihilate either through the sm ew gauge bosons , @xmath11 , or the @xmath10 s : @xmath12 if @xmath9 annihilates through sm gauge bosons , then the final states are clear .",
    "the annihilation into @xmath10 needs further explanation .",
    "if one assumes that there are measurable consequences in experiments then @xmath10 ultimately needs to decay into sm final states .",
    "there are two possibilities that allow @xmath10 to decay .",
    "either the sm matter fields are charged under the dark gauge group , in which case @xmath10 can decay into sm fields based on their charge assignments . otherwise , the @xmath10 gauge bosons can mix with the sm gauge bosons and thereby decay through this mixing .",
    "while either scenario is possible in principle , we will choose the latter and couple @xmath10 to the sm matter through gauge boson mixing .",
    "on general grounds the vector @xmath10 will decay back to sm states by mixing through the photon or the z boson .",
    "however , given the lightness of @xmath10 , the decays going through z mixing will be further suppressed by at least @xmath13 . unless the @xmath7-@xmath10 mixing is much smaller than the z-@xmath10 mixing , one can then assume that @xmath10 couples to sm particles proportionally to their electric charge .",
    "hence the @xmath10 decay branching fractions are completely determined by its mass .",
    "an example annihilation is shown in figure  [ fig : ann ] .",
    "annihilation , @xmath14 via the mixing of @xmath10 and @xmath7.,width=288 ]    with these considerations we have come up with a minimal module that has five particle physics parameters :    * @xmath15 - sets the mass scale for the dm annihilation . * @xmath16 - determines what states @xmath10 can decay into and the kinematics of the decay products . *",
    "@xmath17 - the strength of the gauge coupling in the dark sector . * @xmath18 - a free parameter for the overall cross section . * @xmath19 - a free parameter for the relative contributions of the annihilations into the sm vs dark gauge bosons .",
    "while some of these parameters may seem redundant , they allow us to cover the parameter space of a large number of models without having to calculate within each model separately .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of @xmath17 as a separate parameter is noticeable as we keep @xmath20 and @xmath21 free .",
    "once we stipulate that @xmath10 is a dark gauge boson , we need to allow for the possibility that the dark gauge group is nonabelian .",
    "in fact this is exactly what is desired in  @xcite to explain dama and integral anomalies .",
    "if @xmath10 represents collectively the gauge bosons of a nonabelian group , then there are additional processes for annihilation into the sm compared to those shown in figure  [ fig : ann ] .",
    "annihilation , with the inclusion of the dark sector shower.,width=288 ]    just like in qcd once the gauge bosons are produced , they can shower and split into new gauge bosons .",
    "we give an example of this process in figure  [ fig : sho ] , where after showering the dark gauge boson subsequently decays into sm final states through photon mixing .",
    "this process has not been quantitatively explored before in this context and we demonstrate the effect in later sections .",
    "as we shall see , while naively there is no large enhancement as the @xmath10 s are massive , a significant change in the resulting energy spectrum arises since we assume @xmath22",
    ".    there additionally could be another annihilation channel for @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "this is strongly dependent on the model , and could in principle be used as a separate parameter in our module .",
    "for instance this mode will not occur with any appreciable rate in models where @xmath9 is a single majorana particle .",
    "we choose not to include this as a separate parameter , and instead one can infer bounds on this mode from our @xmath21 appropriately rescaled .      in this section",
    "we calculate the particle physics input for all dark matter indirect experiments . for the experiments that we are interested in",
    ", we simply need the injection spectrum of @xmath24 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 coming from the annihilation of the @xmath9 s .",
    "therefore we need to calculate the inclusive annihilation of @xmath25 at threshold and then extract the energy distribution , @xmath26 , for each particle we are interested in .    to calculate @xmath26 we implement our module in several mc programs and scan over the particle physics parameters @xmath15,@xmath16 and @xmath17 that define it .",
    "we do _ not _ calculate @xmath27 and @xmath21 from first principles , instead we will _",
    "fit _ the experimental data for pamela and atic / ppb - bets to fix these parameters .",
    "the result of this fit will then dictate what boost factor is needed compared to a standard thermal wimp annihilation cross section . if one calculated the sommerfeld effect within a model , this would constrain the values of the masses and gauge couplings given the necessary cross section . however , since we do not wish to focus on one particular model alone , we do not require this consistency check .",
    "additionally once the mass and @xmath17 are given , a model could predict the ratio @xmath21 .",
    "however , @xmath21 can also be an independent of @xmath17 , for instance if the dm fields @xmath9 are singlets under the sm and mixed through a yukawa coupling .    to implement the module in event generators we make the specific choice of @xmath28 for the dark gauge group , and we define @xmath9 to be a bi - doublet under the sm @xmath28 and the hidden @xmath28 .",
    "this choice _ only _ affects the dark gauge boson parton shower directly , since @xmath29 and @xmath21 are fit to data .",
    "however , since we will scan over @xmath17 , a different choice of coupling can still be be used to approximately interpolate amongst different casimirs and extrapolate the results to different gauge groups .",
    "the parameter space we choose to cover is shown in table  [ tab : params ] . our choice of whether to implement a parton shower in the dark sector is a binary one .",
    "this allows us to cover the case where the dark gauge group is @xmath30 and the gauge bosons do nt shower .",

    "in this section we discuss the implications for models that attempt to explain the pamela and atic / ppb - bets excesses , based on the results shown in section  [ sec : pb ] . in section  [ sec : pb ] we have shown by varying the particle physics and astrophysics parameters that only certain regions of parameter space can satisfy all the various experimental constraints .",
    "specifically , the most difficult constraints arose from the hess s measurement of the gc and gr regions .",
    "indeed it was initially believed that hadronic activity from dm was needed to be suppressed in order to avoid creating an excess in the antiproton flux .",

    "this is not a conclusion that we agree with .",
    "these papers primarily investigated the case where dm annihilated directly into leptons .",
    "as shown in section  [ sec : udmdndx ] , the @xmath35 calculated in these cases is actually quite different , and a simple rescaling of the overall rate does not interpolate between the case of directly annihilating into leptons and annihilating through @xmath10 . to demonstrate that there exist viable models that satisfy the high energy constraints we show a best fit point from the scan over our parameters . in figure  [ fig : bestfit ] this point is shown where @xmath36 tev , @xmath37 mev , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , for an einasto profile with @xmath40 and the med propagation parameters .",
    "additionally , for comparison , figure  [ fig : bestfit ] shows the same parameters except we change the dm profile to einasto @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , we show in the figure how hess alters this fit by giving the best fit case where only pamela and atic / ppb - bets are included in the @xmath42 .",
    "this corresponds to a best fit point of @xmath43 gev , @xmath37 mev , @xmath44 , with no parton shower , an einasto density profile with @xmath41 and min propagation parameters . as we can see",
    ", one can find a fit for annihilating background that _ includes _ a photon background for hess and satisfies the data .",
    "still , for a good fit , the dm profile is required to be less cuspy than the preferred profile of @xmath41 .",
    "we can also quantify a suppression factor for an einasto profile with @xmath41 , that could come in principle from several sources , so that the effective @xmath45 is as good as our best fit point . for @xmath37 mev one",
    "needs a suppression factor of 3 - 4 , for @xmath46 mev we need a factor of 4 , while for @xmath47 gev we need a larger suppression of @xmath48 .",
    "a recent paper  @xcite investigated the case of dm annihilating through a light @xmath10 and then into leptons .",
    "their claim was that models of this type that satisfied pamela / atic with standard dm density profiles were ruled out unless an order of magnitude local boost factor was included .",
    "their most stringent bounds come from examining sgr a * , in radio frequencies similar to  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , such a constraint is highly sensitive to knowledge of the dm density profile at distances much below @xmath49 pc which is beyond the resolution limit of current simulations .",
    "nonetheless , if one takes the bound at face value we find that their band that agrees with the pamela measurement is different than ours , and we can fit both pamela and their radio bound . in the region of high energy gammas",
    "this constraint is not more significant than the hess gc one .",
    "the authors also consider bounds from the the sagitarius dwarf galaxy . since the sagitarrius dwarf galaxy is being tidally disrupted by the milky way it is dubious to trust bounds coming from this alone .",
    "we have checked for one of the most studied dwarf galaxies , draco ( that is not too close to our galaxy to be tidally disrupted ) , that the bounds are easily satisfied by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "as discussed , the most significant bound we find arises from the study of the gr region , and as shown in figure  [ fig : bestfit ] they can be satisfied .    while there exist points in parameter space that can satisfy all experimental constraints , this does not mean that generically there is no tension between dm annihilation models of this type and the experimental results . as we can see from section  [ sec : pb ] , in many regions of parameter space",
    "the hess experiment would completely rule out models from the gr data .",
    "this is due to the fact that the hess experiment in both the gc and the gr , records data that has a best fit to a power law .",
    "once one includes dm annihilating in the energy range that hess studies , it automatically introduces a non - power law shape on top of the background .",
    "since the pamela experiment currently studies energies less than the photon energies recorded by hess , there is no tension between these experiments .",
    "however , the inclusion of atic / ppb - bets experiments , automatically signal a mass scale which creates the tension .",
    "we demonstrate this in figure  [ fig : tension ] where we separate our @xmath42 function into @xmath50 and @xmath51 and plot two dimensional contours of @xmath42 for each , in the space of @xmath15 and @xmath52 .",

    "\\end{array}$ ]    as we can see from figure  [ fig : tension ] the best fit for @xmath42 taking into account pamela / atic / ppb - bets alone prefers a lower mass scale and higher cross - sections , while hess prefers a low cross - sections and potentially higher masses in order to preserve its pure power law background .",
    "this generic tension could mean several things .",
    "first , the excesses in pamela and atic / ppb - bets may simply be caused by astrophysics .",
    "pulsars for instance could explain the leptonic excesses without necessarily introducing a large component of high energy gamma rays at the center of our galaxy .",
    "second , it could be a red herring , and as we have demonstrated , models of this type do have points in parameter space that could account for the experimental data . another way to avoid the tension would be to investigate models of decaying dm  @xcite instead of annihilating dm since the amount of photons at the center of the galaxy would then scale like @xmath54 instead of @xmath55 . while these are all possible interpretations",
    ", we wish to point out another .",
    "the starting point of current dm investigations is to automatically assume all the recent excesses reported by experiments , and work under the assumption that there is / will be no conflicting data .",
    "for instance in the case of the atic / ppb - bets experiments the excesses that are shown conflict with the existing ec  @xcite data . it has been pointed out in the past that ec was based on a much smaller detector area and thus could be more prone to systematic errors .",
    "this could be the cause of the apparent discrepancy between the atic / ppb - bets and ec data .",
    "still , it is curious nonetheless that atic / ppb - bets and hess are the experiments that seem to have a tension if the picture of annihilating dm is true .",
    "one possibility could be that the anomaly observed by atic disappears in the future , or that the excess they see is unrelated to dm but rather to astrophysics ( e.g. cooling ) . in this case",
    "a model would only need to satisfy the pamela experiment and the mass scale could be much lower in principle .",

    "the fact that this is a viable option is not immediately clear without calculating the results for the other experiments . indeed ,",
    "if one lowers the mass scale , there are several potential difficulties that need to be confronted .",
    "one needs to make sure that no feature is introduced in the electron flux that would have been seen thus far . at lower energies , even though one can avoid the bounds from the hess gr data , in principle one could now be in danger of over - populating the low energy photons for the egret experiment .",
    "as we show in figure  [ fig : light ] for the case of @xmath57 gev , @xmath37 mev and @xmath58 , with an einasto density profile for @xmath41 and med propagation , one can satisfy all experimental constraints easily with @xmath59 .",
    "this is an incredibly interesting prospect as it opens up possible new avenues for model building and additionally provides even _ more _ testable predictions . by lowering the mass scale",
    "the high energy photons are now completely within reach of the fermi experiment @xcite and furthermore a nontrivial turnover in the positron fraction measured by pamela could be observed . in figure",
    "[ fig : light ] we plot the photon flux expected from the high energy photons observable by fermi when looking at the gc .",
    "this is well within the sensitivity range of the experiment , and it is an open question whether or not the high energy photons are observable compared to the ics contribution .",
    "we postpone this for future work  @xcite .",
    "as we have stated , there are several possibilities for explaining the excesses : annihilating dm for low or high @xmath15 , decaying dm , astrophysics / pulsars , some unknown idea or combination thereof .",
