    "hence , we can not define partition independent entropy of the noisy system using formula ( [ parks ] ) , as the supremum in ( [ parks ] ) is equal to the infinity . on the other hand , there are two kinds of randomness in our model : the first is connected with the deterministic dynamics ; the second comes from the stochastic perturbation .",
    "accordingly , we split the total partition dependent entropy @xmath55 of a noisy system @xmath56 given by ( [ part ] ) and ( [ padep ] ) into two components : the _ noise entropy _ and the _ dynamical entropy_. the latter quantity characterizes the underlying dynamics @xmath41 and is defined by    @xmath57    where the entropy of the noise @xmath58 reads    @xmath59    and @xmath60 is a stochastic system given by ( [ langev ] ) with @xmath48 ( _ pure noise _ ) .",

    "note , that this quantity vanishes for the noise uniformly spread over the entire space ( @xmath77 ) , becomes negative for @xmath78 and diverges to minus infinity in the deterministic limit @xmath79 .    for the system",
    "@xmath80 combining the deterministic evolution @xmath8 and the stochastic perturbation , the probability density of transition from @xmath14 to @xmath15 during one time step is given by @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "the bg - entropy for this system can be defined as    @xmath83    due to the homogeneity of the noise and due to the periodic boundary conditions the integral over @xmath15 in ( [ hbol ] ) does not depend on @xmath14 .",
    "therefore for any system @xmath8 perturbed by a nonzero noise ( @xmath84 ) one obtains    @xmath85    applying this equality and using the same methods as in @xcite we can prove that the total entropy fulfills the following inequalities ( the first inequality can be deduced from the lower bound for the variation of information obtained in theorem  2.3 from @xcite ; the second inequality comes from the definition )    @xmath86    for @xmath48 we get    @xmath87    hence , both the total entropy @xmath88 and the noise entropy @xmath58 diverges logarithmically in the limit @xmath62 .",
    "let us now study how does the dynamical entropy , which is the difference of these quantities , depend on the partition @xmath89 .",
    "if the partition @xmath90 consists of one cell only ( @xmath91 ) , we have @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the dynamical entropy with respect to this trivial partition equals zero for any system , which guarantees that the dynamical entropy given by the supremum over all partitions ( [ hdynsup ] ) is non  negative .",
    "let us now investigate the behavior of the total entropy in the opposite case @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) for a non - zero noise strength @xmath93 . performing the time limit ( [ padep ] ) we find , as in @xcite , that for very fine partitions the total entropy of the system is given approximately by the sum of the boltzmann - gibbs entropy and the entropy of the partition ( this statement is again based on the theorem  2.3 from @xcite )",
    "@xmath94    observe that due to the property ( [ hceqhcf ] ) the right - hand side does not depend on the dynamical system @xmath8 and the approximate equality ( [ totapprox ] ) holds also for the entropy of the noise @xmath58 .",
    "therefore dynamical entropy tends to zero for both limiting cases    @xmath95    let us now discuss , what are the minimal and maximal dynamical entropies admissible for a certain kind of stochastic noise . from ( [ bgineq ] ) and ( [ bgineqnoise ] ) we get    @xmath96",
    "thus the dynamical entropy is bounded from above by @xmath97 .",
    "combining this with ( [ limdyn ] ) one obtain    @xmath98    this relation provides a valuable interpretation of the boltzmann  gibbs entropy .",
    "this quantity , determined by the given probability distribution of the noise @xmath99 , tells us whether the character of the dynamics of a specific deterministic system @xmath8 can be resolved under the influence of this noise .",
    "for example , the rectangular noise of width @xmath77 may be called _ disruptive _ , since the corresponding bg ",
    "entropy is equal to zero , and consequently @xmath100 for every uniform partition @xmath9 . under the influence of such a noise",
    "we have no information , whatsoever , concerning the underlying dynamics @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , it is unlikely to distinguish between two systems , both having ks  entropies larger than @xmath97 of the noise present .",
    "evidently , in the deterministic limit the maximal entropy tends to infinity . on the other hand , in this case",
    ", one obtains in ( [ limdyn ] ) the ks  entropy .",
    "this apparent paradox consists in the order of the two limits : the number of cells in coarse - graining to infinity and the noise strength to zero .",
    "these two limits do not commute .",
    "note that several authors proposed different approaches to the notion of dynamical entropy of noisy system .",
    "crutchfield and packard @xcite introduced the _ excess entropy _ to analyze the difference between partial entropies of a noisy system and the corresponding deterministic system , and investigated its dependence on the noise strength @xmath93 and the number of the time steps @xmath16 .    in order to avoid problems with the unbounded growth of the total entropy for sufficiently fine partitions gaspard and wang studied @xmath101entropy @xcite , where the supremum is taken only over the class of the partitions , for which the minimal diameter of a cell is larger than @xmath101 .",
    "this quantity can be numerically approximated by the algorithm of cohen and procaccia @xcite .",
    "the @xmath101-entropy diverges logarithmically in the limit @xmath102 ; the character of this divergence may be used to classify various kinds of random processes @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the dynamical entropy on time yields another interesting problem . for discrete deterministic systems",
    "the ks - entropy is additive in time : @xmath103 . on the other hand it follows from ( [ hmax ] ) that the dynamical entropy of a noisy system fulfills @xmath104 , for each time @xmath105 .",

    "the related issue has been recently raised by fox @xcite in the context of deterministic evolution of gaussian densities .",
    "the discontinuity of @xmath106 in the limit @xmath7 is a consequence of the fact that the another limits : time to infinity and noise strength to zero do not commute .    in some sense",
    "this resembles the noncommutativity of the limits _ time _",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 in quantum mechanics , crucial for investigation of the so  called _ quantum chaos _",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "continuing this analogy even further , the entropy of noise corresponds to the entropy of quantum measurement @xcite , while the boltzmann - gibbs entropy @xmath112 plays the role of the wehrl entropy @xcite , recently used by two of us ( ws , k ) to estimate the coherent states dynamical entropy @xcite .",
