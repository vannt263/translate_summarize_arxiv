    "the globular clusters belong to the oldest populations in our galaxy . for the general reviews on globular clusters , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their formation @xcite is closely related to the formation process of our galaxy .",
    "the formation of a globular cluster may take place in two stages : ( 1 ) the formation of a proto - globular cloud ( pgc ) and ( 2 ) the formation of a star cluster from the pgc .",
    "there are three scenarios for the formation of a pgc , denoted as primary , secondary , and tertiary model @xcite , where the pgc forms in different stages , i.e. , before , during , or after the collapse of the galaxy , respectively .",
    "* the primary model was suggested by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the jeans mass of the recombination stage of the universe is comparable to the observed masses of globular clusters and thus the pgc can form due to the gravitational instability .",
    "globular clusters may be debris of these objects .",
    "the most serious problem with this primary model is that there have been few intergalactic globular clusters discovered .",
    "almost all globular clusters ever discovered exist in galaxies . * in the secondary model , on which we concentrate in the present paper , the pgc forms due to thermal instabilities @xcite .",
    "our detailed investigation and calculation are presented in the following sections . * for the tertiary model , one example is that globular clusters form from large - scale unorganized motion of interstellar gas as in the magellanic clouds , which are now producing young clusters @xcite .",
    "another example is that very young globular clusters are observed in nearby galaxy ngc 1705 and 1569 @xcite .",
    "once the pgc forms , there might be many ways to form a globular cluster ( gc ) .",
    "@xcite summarized the scenarios of the formation of gcs from pgcs as follows .",
    "the pgc can be divided into two types depending on their masses .",
    "the cloud , whose mass exceeds the jeans mass , is gravitationally unstable , thus spontaneously collapsing to form stars .",
    "the cloud , whose mass is smaller than the jeans mass , is stable until some instabilities are introduced . a cloud - cloud collision or cloud - disk collision can trigger such instability .",
    "when such collisions occur , the cloud would become thermally unstable owing to the efficient cooling .",
    "this cooling would lead to the formation of a very dense region , thus inducing a burst of star formation .    in the present paper , we examine quantitatively the above still qualitative scenario of the globular cluster formation .",
    "we use our smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code @xcite to simulate the formation of a globular cluster from a pgc .",
    "our code includes the following physical processes : radiative cooling , star formation , energy feedback from stars including stellar winds and supernovae , and chemical enrichment from stars .",
    "the sph method which includes star formation processes like ours has been applied to many astrophysical problems .",
    "such problems include the formation of isolated galaxies @xcite , the evolution of galaxies @xcite , and the cosmological simulations @xcite . however , our study is the first attempt to apply this method to the globular cluster formation ( preliminary results have been presented in @xcite ) .    among the two triggers of the instability , collapse and collision , we concentrate on the collapse case in the present paper .",
    "the collision case for a wide range of parameters ( masses of the two clouds , a relative velocity between the clouds etc . ) will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "this paper consists of the following sections . in section 2 our sph method",
    "is described . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our linear analysis for the thermal instabilities to form a pgc . in section 4",
    ", we present the results of the evolution of the pgc with two different initial compositions of gases .",
    "sections 5 and 6 are devoted to discussions and concluding remarks , respectively .",
    "to simulate the formation of a star cluster from gases , we use our grape - sph code using remote - grape library @xcite .",
    "the grape is a special purpose computer for the self gravity calculations in general n - body system @xcite .",
    "our grape - sph code includes various physical processes , e.g. , radiative cooling , star formation , and feedback from formed stars .",
    "there are many different implementations of the sph method ( a recent comparison of various sph implementations is presented in @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    ", we describe an essential point of our sph code .",
    "the sph formulation that we use is the same as the described in @xcite .",
    "we use the smoothing length that can vary spatially and evolve with time , and integrate equations of motion with a second order runge - kutta method as described in @xcite .",
    "details of the implementation of our code are described in @xcite . in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe the physical processes ( cooling , star formation , and feedback ) in some detail .",
    "the radiative cooling rates depend on the temperature and ionization states of the gas .",
    "also , the chemical composition of the gas affects the cooling rate drastically .",
    "we perform sph simulations for the following three cases ( a , b , c ) of the gas with different physical state and chemical composition .",
    "case a : we assume that the chemical composition of the gas is primordial with no heavy elements and the gas is in ionization equilibrium . in this case , our treatment of radiative cooling is essentially the same as adopted by @xcite ; they computed the cooling rate using the two - body processes of h and he , and free - free emissions . the cooling function ( @xmath1 )",
    "is shown in figure [ cooling ] with the solid line . in this case , the cooling rate decreases very rapidly as the temperature @xmath2 decreases below @xmath3 k so that the gas would not radiatively cool below @xmath4 k.    case b : we assume that the gas includes some heavy elements and is in ionization equilibrium . in this case , we use the cooling function with different chemical composition that is computed by mappings iii software by r.s .",
    "sutherland ( mappings iii is the successor of mappings ii that is described in @xcite ) .",
    "we compute the cooling function of the ionization equilibrium gas for [ fe / h ] @xmath5 - 0.0 with the solar abundance ratio ( see table 4 of @xcite ) and present the results in figure [ cooling ] with the dashed lines ( each line corresponds to [ fe / h ] = @xmath6 respectively from the top to the bottom ) .",
    "existence of heavy elements significantly enhances the cooling rates . at @xmath7",
    "k , the cooling due to the forbidden line emission of carbon and oxygen is efficient . for [ fe / h ]",
    "= @xmath8 , the cooling rates around @xmath9k are 100 times larger than the cooling rates of primordial hydrogen and helium gas .",
    "these differences would make the evolution of the gas very different .",
    "case c : we concern about the non - equilibrium cooling .",
    "if the gas cools from high temperatures , ionization equilibrium is not realized .",
    "figure [ recombination ] shows the ratio between the recombination time ( @xmath10 ) of hydrogen and the cooling time ( @xmath11 ) of primordial gas in ionization equilibrium ; @xmath10/@xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 are defined as @xmath12 and @xmath13 where the @xmath14 is the recombination coefficient of hydrogen and electron , @xmath15 is the fraction of free electrons , and @xmath16 is the bolzman constant . for @xmath14 , we use the value of @xcite . clearly , the cooling time is much shorter than the recombination time for @xmath17 k , so that ionization equilibrium is not realized when the gas cools from high temperatures . in the non - equilibrium case ,",
    "the existence of electrons and ionized hydrogen at @xmath7 k makes it possible to form h@xmath18 molecules through the creation of intermediaries h@xmath19 and h@xmath20 as : @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "these h@xmath18 molecules cause further cooling down to @xmath23 k owing to the rotational - vibrational line excitation .    to include the effect of such molecular cooling , we have to solve rate equations that determine the ionization states of h and he atoms , and the formation and destruction of h@xmath18 molecules . in our case ,",
    "the typical time step in solving the rate equations is shorter than the dynamical time step , which is determined mainly by the courant condition . integrating all equations with a shorter timestep than the dynamical time is very costed work .",
    "so we divide the dynamical timestep with dynamical variables ( density etc . ) being constant in solving the energy and rate equations , which is similar to the method adopted in @xcite .",
    "the rate - coefficients are also the same as used in @xcite .",
    "included species are h@xmath24 , h@xmath25 , he@xmath24 , he@xmath25 , he@xmath26 , h@xmath19 , h@xmath27 , h@xmath18 , h@xmath28 and e , where h@xmath28 is the exited hydrogen molecule . in our sph code",
    ", we solve the rate equations for 10 species in each sph particle with a reasonable computing time .",
    "solving the rate equations for the gas including heavy elements ( over 200 species ) is not feasible with a current resource so that we only concern the hydrogen and helium plasma in the present paper .",
    "the cooling function for the non - equilibrium case is presented in figure [ cooling ] with the dotted line . in computing these cooling rates",
    ", we follow the isobaric temperature evolution of the fully ionized gas . initially , the temperature and hydrogen number density of the gas are 10@xmath29 k and 0.01 @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "we assume optically thin plasmas so that the gas cools rapidly . around @xmath17",
    "k , h@xmath18 molecules begin to form . at @xmath7",
    "k , the cooling rate due to h@xmath18 molecules is comparable to the cooling rate for [ fe / h ] = @xmath8 gas .    finally , we summarize the treatment of the cooling rates in our sph code",
    ". we can perform sph simulations for these three cases a , b and c. in the present paper , we will study the evolution of a pgc with two different initial chemical compositions , e.g. , a metal - free gas cloud and a metal - rich gas cloud .",
    "in the former case , we solve the energy and rate equations simultaneously for each sph particle ( case b ) if the gas temperature is lower than @xmath31 k and the gas particle is not in the heating phase ( see section 2.3 ) .",
    "if these conditions are met , we use the pre - computed cooling table for the ionization equilibrium case ( case a ) . in the latter case , we use the pre - computed cooling table to solve the energy equations ( case c ) .",
    "our treatment of star formation is the same as adopted by @xcite .",
    "hereafter , `` star '' means `` star particle '' , which is not an individual star but an association of many stars . a star forms in the region where the flow is converging , cooling , and jeans unstable .",
    "these conditions are expressed as @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 here @xmath11 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the cooling time , dynamical time , and sound crossing time , respectively , and expressed as @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath41 is the specific thermal energy , and @xmath42 is the local sound speed . a star forms in the region where these all three conditions are satisfied .",
    "the star formation rate is given as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the density of a star , and @xmath45 with a star formation parameter @xmath46 .",
    "in the present paper , we adopt @xmath47 , i.e. , a star forms in a dynamical time .",
    "the last term of equation [ starform ] is similar to the schmidt s law @xcite . integrating equation ( [ starform ] ) over one time step @xmath48 and making calculations with the equations for sph",
    ", we obtain the mass of a newly formed star in @xmath48 as @xmath49 \\pi h_i^3 \\rho_i .",
    "\\label{star_mass}\\ ] ] the newly formed star is then treated as a collision - less particle .",
    "we introduce the minimum allowed mass ( @xmath50 10 @xmath51 ) for the newly formed star to prevent the unphysical effects in the equation of motion and the treatment of the feedback processes .",
    "we note the star formation recipes in our sph code . in the regions with increasing densities , first two conditions for the star formation ( eq . [ sf_1 ] and [ sf_2 ] ) are almost satisfied .",
    "thus whether star forms in some regions is determined mostly by the jeans criterion ( eq . [ sf_3 ] ) .",
    "the critical density for the star formation in our treatment is obtained as @xmath52 here , it is assumed that the neighbor radius is expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is determined experimentally , because @xmath55 is determined in order to make the number of neighbor particles almost constant in some range ( 30 - 80 in our codes ) .",
    "since the typical value of @xmath54 is 1.0 - 1.1 , @xmath56 ranges 1.0 - 2.0 .",
    "then if @xmath57 is constant , the critical density is determined almost only by the temperature .",
    "the typical calculations in the present paper use 5000 gas particles for a 10@xmath58 @xmath51   gas sphere .",
    "thus the initial mass per particle ( @xmath57 in eq .",
    "[ sf_4 ] ) is @xmath50 200 @xmath51 . for @xmath59",
    "k and 10@xmath60 k , the critical density for star formation is @xmath61 and 10@xmath62 g @xmath30 , respectively . with the star formation recipes used in our sph code , the star forms only in the very high density region if @xmath4 k. there are , however , the maximum density ( @xmath63 ) that numerically reached in the sph method ; it is estimated @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of neighbor particles and @xmath66 is the gravitational softening length . in the present calculations , @xmath67 g @xmath30 , these arguments ensure that with the star formation recipes used in our sph code and the initial conditions of the present calculations , the star forms in the region where the temperature is as low as 10@xmath60 k.      the formed stars eject gases and heavy elements in stellar winds and type ii supernova explosions and heats up , accelerate , and enrich a circumstellar and an interstellar medium .",
    "high energy explosions like supernova produce high temperature and low density regions in interstellar medium . in the sph method ,",
    "the numerical accuracy for high density regions is much better than mesh based methods but the accuracy for low density regions are poorer . a typical resolution of usual sph simulations , e.g. , @xcite , including a star formation process ( 100 - 1000 pc ) is larger than a typical size of supernova remnants ( @xmath68 pc ) .",
    "thus , it is difficult to properly include the energy , momentum , and mass release from stars in the sph method because of the nature of the sph method and the poor resolutions in current computing resources .",
    "we must use some approximations to mimic real feedback processes in the sph method .",
    "one of the method has been proposed by @xcite . in their method , the energy produced by a supernova explosion is distributed to neighbor gas particles of each star mostly as a thermal energy and the rest is distributed as a velocity perturbation to the gas particles ; the fraction of the energy in a kinetic form is a free parameter ( we note that @xcite presented the population synthesis model of stellar feedback processes ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we distribute the energy to neighbor particles in a pure thermal form as a zero - th order approximation , because the size and time scale of our model are much smaller than those of a galaxy formation model of @xcite .",
    "the energy ejection rate per star is given as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the total energy ejected by stellar winds during the stellar lifetime and @xmath71 are the energy ejected by one type ii supernova explosion .",
    "the @xmath72 is the number of stars per unit time expelling their envelopes at the current epoch and @xmath73 is the rate of type ii supernovae .",
    "we define the @xmath72 and @xmath73 as follows @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the initial mass function ( imf ) , namely @xmath77 gives the number of stars in the mass range of ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) and the @xmath80 is the stellar lifetime @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we assume the power law type imf as @xmath81 where the @xmath82 is the constant .",
    "for the upper and lower limit masses in eq .",
    "( 19 ) , @xmath83 120 @xmath51   and @xmath84 0.05 @xmath51   are assumed . in eq .",
    "( 17 ) and ( 18 ) , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 50.0 @xmath51 ) and @xmath87 ( @xmath86 8.0 @xmath51 ) are the upper and lower limit masses of the stars that explode as type ii supernovae .    for the supernova energy , we assume that @xmath88 erg . for the stellar wind , @xmath70 is estimated to be 0.2@xmath89 erg for solar metallicity stars from the observational data of ob associations @xcite .",
    "the chemical abundance of a massive star significantly affects @xmath70 @xcite , so that we use metallicity dependent e@xmath90 as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the mass fraction of metal in the star .      in our code",
    ", the mass ejection due to stellar winds is combined with the mass ejection due to type ii supernova .",
    "thus , the mass ejection rate per star is written as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the average mass ejected by stellar winds and type ii supernovae defined as @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the mass that is locked up in the neutron star and assumed to be 1.4 @xmath51 .",
    "the fraction of heavy metal in @xmath97 is computed by the nucleosynthesis yield of type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "we assume that the feedback phase continues for @xmath98 yr from the formation of each star and is divided into two phases : a stellar wind phase and a supernova phase .",
    "the stellar wind phase continues for @xmath99 yr , during which only the energy ejection from stars is included ; the ejected mass is included in the supernova phase for simplicity .",
    "the supernova phase begins at @xmath100 and ends at @xmath101 . during the supernova phase",
    ", the energy ejection is given by eq .",
    "the mass ejection is the sum of the contributions by the stellar winds and type ii supernovae .",
    "the thermal energies , gases , and heavy elements from stellar winds and supernovae are smoothed over neighbor particles of the star within a neighbor radius of @xmath102 ( feedback radius ) .",
    "we treat @xmath102 as a parameter to meet the observational constraints .",
    "such neighbor particles are called `` in heating phase '' .",
    "when the gas particles are in heating phase , we assume that the cooling is suppressed as proposed in @xcite .",
    "this treatment produces the high temperature region around the star .",
    "thus , the star formation is forbidden in the gas particles in heating phase .",
    "we first examine the radiative condensations , which occur in a wide range of astrophysical circumstances from solar prominence to interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "radiative condensations in optically thin plasma have been considered by many authors since the pioneering work by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the scale length of gravitational instability in a collapsing proto - galaxy is much larger than the radii of globular clusters @xcite . as will be shown in the following sections , the scale length of radiative condensations is comparable to the radii of globular clusters .",
    "thus , in a collapsing proto - galaxy , radiative condensations may be the only mechanism to form a pgc @xcite .",
    "the characteristic equation for the growth rate of radiative condensations , @xmath103 , is obtained from the linearized equations for perturbations as @xmath104 where @xmath42 is the sound speed , @xmath105 is the ratio of the specific heats , @xmath106 is the wavenumber of the perturbation , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the wavenumber of sound waves whose frequencies are equal to the growth rate of isothermal and isochoric perturbation , respectively , and @xmath109 is the inverse of the scale length of thermal conduction @xcite .",
    "@xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 are expressed as @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the equilibrium temperature and density , respectively , k@xmath115 is the bolzman constant , and @xmath1 is the cooling function ( figure [ cooling ] ) .",

    "( [ chara ] ) as a cubic equation of @xmath103 for different @xmath120 , we obtain the dispersion relation between @xmath103 and @xmath120 . in applying to our galaxy , we adopt @xmath121 k and @xmath122 g @xmath30 @xcite . with these values",
    ", the dispersion relation has a peak at some @xmath120 . in the present paper ,",
    "we assume that the scale for the maximum growth rate is typical scale of a pgc . to obtain the typical scale of a pgc for different @xmath113 and @xmath114 , equation ( [ chara ] )",
    "is viewed as a quadratic in @xmath123 ( see section ii ( d ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the results for different @xmath113 and @xmath114 are presented in figure [ m_n ] . in applying to our galaxy",
    ", we obtain the scale length of @xmath124 pc .",
    "this scale length is consistent with the following simple estimate . for the adopted cooling function",
    ", the wavelengths for @xmath107 and @xmath109 with @xmath121 k and @xmath122 g @xmath30 are respectively obtained as @xmath125 this implies that the perturbation with a scale greater than @xmath126 pc is dumped owing to the limit of the sound speed , and the perturbation with a scale smaller than 1 pc is also dumped by thermal conduction .",
    "thus the typical scale of a pgc in our galaxy is estimated to be several hundreds pc and the mass of a pgc ranges from 10@xmath29 to 10@xmath127 @xmath51 .",
    "the estimated scale of a pgc is larger than the present radius of globular clusters ( 10 - 100 pc ) .",
    "this implies that during radiative condensations , a pgc shrinks before star formation begins or star formation in a pgc occurs in the central region of the cloud .",
    "if we consider the metal - free pgc where the ionization equilibrium is achieved , the cooling time , @xmath128 , of the pgc is much shorter than the dynamical time , @xmath129 ( @xmath130 0.25 for @xmath121 k and @xmath122 g @xmath30 ) .",
    "after the short period of radiative condensations ( @xmath131 ) , the pgc becomes a warm dense cloud ( @xmath4 k ) surrounded by a hot thin gas with @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the qualitative discussion on the evolution of such a metal - free pgc has been presented by @xcite .",
    "they argued that in the first stage of collapsing galaxy , the assumption of ionization equilibrium is not valid because of little radiative emission .",
    "if the ionization equilibrium is not achieved , the temperature of high density regions can be as low as @xmath132 k due to hydrogen molecular cooling . in this case , the high density cold cloud with @xmath133 k is surrounded by a warm gas .",

    "these first generation stars are the source of radiative emission to maintain the ionization equilibrium .",
    "if such radiation continues long enough , a cold pgc will evolve almost isothermally with @xmath4 k and form the isothermal profile of @xmath135 .",
    "the core size of the pgc will decrease from the initial size of several hundreds pc to a size comparable to the observed globular cluster . according to these arguments",
    ", we can assume that the density structure of a pgc has a form of @xmath135 .    for the initial conditions of the pgc",
    ", we use the king profile with fixed mass of @xmath136 @xmath51   which nearly equals to the jeans mass of the current conditions ( @xmath114 and @xmath113 ) .",
    "we assume that this sphere represents the inner regions of the pgc .",
    "we examine three different cases for a initial radius of @xmath137 150 , 200 , and 300 pc .",

    "the reason for such a metallicity dependence is summarized below .",
    "the bound stellar mass , the central stellar density , and the central velocity dispersion are summarized in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the results depend on the metallicity as follows :    1 .",
    "the initial metallicity significantly affects the star formation history .",
    "this difference makes the subsequent evolution different .",
    "2 .   for the higher metallicity ,",
    "the final stellar mass at @xmath149 10 myr is larger because of the more efficient cooling rate .",
    "3 .   the bound stellar mass is not an increasing function of the initial metallicity .",
    "this is because heating due to the stellar winds is larger for higher metallicity .",
    "4 .   for lower metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath162 ) , only @xmath170 @xmath51   stars form .",
    "this implies that [ fe / h ] @xmath0 is necessary to form globular clusters of @xmath151 @xmath51   if @xmath171 300 pc .      in this subsection",
    ", we describe the dependence of the results on various numerical parameters , e.g. , the initial particle number ( @xmath172 ) and the feedback radius ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "we use the metal - rich cloud of [ fe / h ] @xmath167 as a reference model , where @xmath173 5000 and @xmath145 3 pc .",
    "first , we describe the dependence on the initial particle number . with larger ( smaller ) number of initial gas particles ,",
    "the initial masses of the gas particles are smaller ( larger ) .",
    "there is no strong dependence on the mass of the gas particles in our star formation recipes because eq .",
    "( [ star_mass ] ) dose not include the mass of the gas particles .",
    "however , the maximum density ( @xmath63 ) that can be represented in the sph method depends on the mass of the gas particles , which may produce weak dependence on @xmath172 . to confirm this",
    ", we evolve the model with @xmath174 . the overall evolution is almost indistinguishable to the reference model .",
    "the stellar mass at @xmath149 10 myr becomes @xmath175 @xmath51 , which is slightly smaller than @xmath176 @xmath51  in the reference model . for @xmath177 ( a half of the reference model ) , we obtain the stellar mass of @xmath168 @xmath51 . in figure",
    "[ compare_1 ] , we compare the gas density profiles at @xmath149 10 myr for different @xmath172 .",
    "the position of the shell for the model with @xmath174 is different from other models because of the smaller stellar mass at the same epoch .",
    "however , all three models show the similar density profiles so that we conclude that the dependence on the initial gas particle number is week .",
    "thus , @xmath178 5000 is sufficient for the current numerical model .",
    "secondary , we describe the dependence on the size of the feedback radius @xmath102 . in our model ,",
    "the cooling and the star formation are suppressed for the gas particles in heating phase .",
    "we therefore expect that the size of @xmath102 affects the star formation history . with larger @xmath145 5 pc ,",
    "the star formation rates are smaller and the final stellar mass ( @xmath179 @xmath51 ) is smaller than @xmath176 @xmath51   in the reference model ( @xmath145 5 pc ) . on the other hand",
    ", we obtain the stellar mass of @xmath180 @xmath51   with smaller @xmath102 (= 2 pc ) . within the reasonable range of @xmath102 around 3pc , the final stellar mass changes by a factor of 0.7 - 1.5 .",
    "the results of our calculations are summarized as follows ( see also table [ table1 ] ) :    1 .   in all cases , the overall evolution is similar .",
    "initially , the star burst occurs in the central region .",
    "the central star burst is halted by the heating due to type ii supernovae . the heating cause the expansion of the central region and forms a shell structure .",
    "the subsequent star formation occurs in the shell .",
    "2 .   for the metal - free collapse case , the stellar mass at @xmath149 10 myr correlates with initial concentrations . to obtain the star cluster as massive as globular clusters ( @xmath151 @xmath51 ) , the initial concentration of the pgc must be large enough , i.e. , @xmath158 pc .",
    "3 .   for the metal - rich collapse",
    ", the initial metallicity significantly affects the evolution . to obtain the star cluster as massive as globular clusters",
    ", the initial metallicity must be as larger as [ fe / h ] @xmath181 .",
    "if the initial metallicity is low ( [ fe / h ] @xmath182 ) , very few stars form .",
    "this suggests that during the initial phase of the galaxy formation , i.e. , when the ism contains little heavy element , the formation efficiency of the globular cluster is low .",
    "5 .   the results",
    "is not strongly affected by the initial number of gas particles .",
    "@xmath178 5000 is sufficient for the current numerical model .",
    "the dependence on the feedback radius is more evident .",
    "in all our numerical models , a shell - like gaseous structure is formed .",
    "the formation of the shell - like structure of gases has also been reported in the simulations of the formation of dwarf elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "they argued that the difference in the density structure between normal ellipticals ( de vaucouleurs law ) and dwarf ellipticals ( exponential law ) can be explained by the formation of such a shell - like structure and the star formation in the shell .",
    "the most crucial difference between the normal elliptical and the dwarf is their mass , and the less massive galaxy is more strongly affected by the energy inputs from stars .",
    "similar argument may be applicable to our numerical models . in the case of the globular cluster formation",
    ", however , the mass is even smaller than the dwarf galaxies . owing to this fact",
    ", the effect of the energy inputs from stars is more drastic so that the star formation in the shell is much less efficient than in the dwarf galaxies .",
    "also , the stars formed in the shell is not gravitationally bound due to the outward velocity of the shell .",
    "thus , the bound globular cluster consists of the stars formed before the shell formation .",
    "the stellar density of such stars is not affected by the shell formation and the star formation in the shell .",
    "the chemical composition of stars in globular clusters is one of the most crucial quantities to constrain the model for the globular cluster formation .",
    "the stars in a globular cluster have almost the same heavy elements abundances @xcite .",
    "this small dispersion in metallicity ( @xmath183 $ ] ) suggests that the formation period of globular clusters is so short that the stars in globular clusters can be regarded to form almost simultaneously as shown in our numerical models .",
    "@xcite suggested that the second generation stars would form in the shell and the self - enrichment could occur there . in our model",
    ", the star formation takes place in the shell after @xmath149 5 myr ( see figure [ 150_free_birth ] ) .",
    "however , when the stars form in the shell , the shell has not been enriched with newly ejected heavy metal as shown in the solid line in figure [ 150_free_birth ] .",
    "this line shows the radius of the metal - enriched region defined as @xmath184 ) by summing over the metal - enriched gas particles .",
    "the metal - enriched region expands outwardly but does not reach the star forming region , which implies that the self - enrichment dose not occur in our model ( we note that the star formation is suppressed in the gas particles near the stars in our numerical model as described in section 2.3.3 ) . in the present model ,",
    "no external medium outside the cloud is included , because of technical difficulties in the sph method ( see , however , @xcite for a possible improvement ) .",
    "if there exists external medium outside the cloud , the density of the shell would be higher and the star formation history would be different ; this possibility needs further study to confirm .",
    "when a pgc is an initially metal - free cloud or the initial metallicity of a pgc is low , the resulted mass and the central stellar density are lower than the observed mass and density of the globular clusters .",
    "such `` failed ''",
    "globular clusters might be the field halo stars .",
    "another possibility is a open cluster .",
    "typical age of open clusters in our galaxy is @xmath185 yr .",
    "however , there also exist such old open clusters as @xmath186 gyr @xcite .",
    "the age of the most old open cluster is comparable to the age of globular clusters .",
    "the central density of the `` failed ''",
    "globular cluster is as low as the central density of typical open clusters .",
    "thus , the formation processes of such old open clusters may be the similar to our model of globular cluster formation but starting from lower initial concentration .",
    "very old open clusters might be the debris of `` failed '' globular clusters and there might have existed many more open clusters at the formation of our galaxy .",
    "for the processes of globular clusters formation , only the qualitative scenarios have been discussed previously @xcite . in this paper , we present the first attempt to simulate the globular cluster formation with three - dimensional hydrodynamical method , which includes the star formation and its feedback effects .",
    "we assume that , in the collapsing galaxy , isothermal cold clouds form through thermal condensations and become proto - globular clouds .",
    "we obtain the size of proto - globular clouds by means of the linear stability analysis ( figure [ m_n ] ) and compute the evolution of the inner region of the pgc starting from various initial radius @xmath138 .",
    "the results of our calculations are summarized as follows :    1 .   in order for the globular cluster - like system to form from a metal - free pgc",
    ", the initial concentration of the pgc must be large enough .",
    "it is required that the metallicity of a pgc is high enough to produce the globular cluster - like system . in our calculations ,",
    "the required metallicity is estimated to be [ fe / h ] @xmath0 .",
    "3 .   in all cases , the shell like structure of the gas forms .",
    "although the star formation occurs in the shell , the self - enrichment is not seen to occur",
    ".      1 .   in the collapsing proto - galaxy ,",
    "the first generation stars of @xmath134 @xmath51   form due to the efficient cooling by hydrogen molecules .",
    "such population iii stars eject the gas with heavy elements and chemically contaminate the proto - galaxy gases .",
    "such first generation stars radiate dissociative photons , and the entire proto - galaxy is settled down to ionization equilibrium .",
    "3 .   with equilibrium cooling",
    ", the density perturbation grows due to thermal instability . and forms an isothermal cloud with a density structure of @xmath187 .",
    "such clouds are the proto - cloud of globular clusters .",
    "when the density of the pgc becomes high enough , the burst of star formation occurs .",
    "some high density clouds produce the globular clusters , and others may produce the field stars and/or the halo open clusters .",
    "5 .   during the formation of the galaxy ,",
    "the formation efficiency of the globular cluster become significantly large when the metallicity of the pgc become as large as [ fe / h ] @xmath181 .    as mentioned in section 5.1",
    ", we do not take account of the effect of the external medium in the present calculations .",
    "if we include the effect of the external medium , the structure of the shell may be different and further star formation may occur in that shell .",
    "@xcite suggested that only a few supernovae per myr is sufficient to reverse the contraction of the 10@xmath58 @xmath51   cloud .",
    "such an effect of the external medium needs to be studied .",
    "the globular cluster formation is considered to occur not only in the proto - galaxies but also in the present galaxies , e.g. , lmc , smc , and interacting galaxy ngc4038/ngc4039 .",
    "in such environment , different formation processes would take place , which correspond to the tertiary models @xcite . in the case of ngc4038/ngc4039 ( the antennae galaxies )",
