    "* @xmath283 is not reduced to a single cycle . in this case",
    "we are left with a series of questions , for instance : * * * question 1 * : can we find @xmath147 such that rational cycles are not dense in @xmath283 ? * * * question 2 * : when does @xmath283 contain a ball in @xmath286 ?    * aknowledgements : * the authors acknowledge l. sadun and robert f. williams for allowing the reproduction of some figures from @xcite .",
