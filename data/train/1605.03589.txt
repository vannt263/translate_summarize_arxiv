    "in the hierarchical cold dark matter and dark energy ( @xmath2cdm ) model for galaxy formation , matter condenses into small clumps that then merge to create increasingly massive objects over time .",
    "this model has provided several predictions that are in excellent agreement with observations ( e.g. , spergel et al .",
    "2007 ; larson et al . 2011 ) . for star formation to begin in @xmath2cdm ,",
    "the temperature of gas contained within condensed dark matter ` halos ' must cool sufficiently to allow the formation of galaxies . because larger galaxies have more gravitational compression , and hence a higher temperature , they might be expected to take longer to cool and form stars , with the largest galaxies only now reaching significant star formation rates ( sfrs ) .",
    "observational studies of star formation rates , on the other hand , have found several surprising trends : the cosmic star formation rate density reaches a peak at @xmath3 , 5 - 3 billion years after the big bang and then decreases until today ( hopkins & beacom , 2006 ; karim et al .",
    "2011 ) , sfrs peaked earlier in more massive galaxies and more recently in smaller galaxies ( e.g. guzman et al .",
    "1997 ; brinchmann & ellis 2000 ) , and today sfrs are lower in more massive galaxies ( heavens et al .",
    "2004 ; panter et al .",
    "these trends , known collectively as ` downsizing ' ( e.g. cowie et al .",
    "1996 ; bauer et al . 2005 ; panter et al . 2007 ; karim 2011 ) , are clearly at odds with the naive predictions of the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "a similar such discrepancy involves the properties of galaxy clusters , as constrained by high - resolution x - ray and radio observations such as those from the chandra observatory and the very large array . while many clusters appear to be quiescent , about a third show strong peaks in their central x - ray surface brightness distributions , indicating that their gas is cooling rapidly ( e.g. fabian & nulsen 1977 ; nulsen et al .",
    "1982 ; stewart et al . 1984 ; fabian 1994 ; tamura et al . 2001 ; cavagnolo et al . 2009 ) .",
    "however , this cooling is neither accompanied by strong star formation nor a significant fraction of gas colder than 1 kev ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "2001 ; rafferty et al . 2006",
    "; mcnamara & nulsen 2007 ) .",
    "instead galaxy formation is halted by an unknown energy source ( e.g.  croton et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "a prominent theory is that energetic feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is required to explain these two discrepancies ( e.g. , scannapieco & oh 2004 ; springel et al .",
    "2005 ; thacker et al .",
    "2006 ; dunn & fabian 2006 ; sijacki et al .",
    "2007 ; booth & schaye 2009 ; dubois et al . 2013 ; martizzi et al . 2013 ) .",
    "agn are among the most energetic objects in the universe , characterized by their extremely luminous cores powered by the infall of gas from a relativistic accretion disk ( e.g. , rees 1984 ) onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) with mass @xmath4 .",
    "agn are associated with two modes of feedback into their environments .",
    "the kinematic or radio mode is associated with collimated relativistic jets , and low and radiatively inefficient accretion rates ( e.g. , falcke & biermann , 1999 ; sambruna et al . 2000 ; merloni & heinz 2007 ) , while the quasar or wind mode is associated with isotropic energy deposit , and high and radiatively efficient accretion ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "depending on the feedback mode , it has been shown that agn can provide the energy needed to maintain the hot icm ( e.g. , dunn & fabian 2006 ) , with kinematic feedback creating the large buoyant bubbles ( e.g. , dunn et al .",
    "it is also clear that this feedback can hamper cooling of galactic halo gas , preferentially reducing the sfr first in large halos at early times , and then smaller halos at late times ( e.g. , scannapieco & oh 2004 ; scannapieco et al .",
    "agn also act to remove , via accretion and heating , the low specific angular momentum ( sam ) gas from the central region of its halo , gas that would otherwise form stars .",
    "this leads to a net increase in the galactic sam .",
    "however , agn can also increase galactic sam where feedback has heated gas and reduced the of possibly high angular momentum gas into the galactic disk ( e.g. , dubois et al .",
    "2013 ; genel et al .",
    "2015 ; nelson et al .",
    "2015 ) , .",
    "unfortunately , agn feedback is extremely difficult to simulate as its effects span several orders of magnitude , originating on sub - parsec scales , and impacting kiloparsec and even megaparsec scales .",
    "thus numerical methods must implement a subgrid prescriptions for injecting the feedback model if they are resolving cluster or cosmological scales .",
    "the nature of this feedback is also highly debated , with different studies focusing on different input mechanisms for the feedback energy , and different environments in which to study its effects .",
    "the first models of agn feedback were limited to smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations .",
    "springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used the sph code gadget-2 ( springel 2005 ) to study individual and merging galaxies with black holes ( bhs ) and feedback , injected into the simulation thermally and isotropically .",
    "they found that the feedback energy was sufficient to regulate the bh growth .",
    "thacker et al .",
    "( 2006b ; 2009 ) carried out sph simulations using the hydra ( couchman et al .",
    "1995 ; thacker & couchman 2006 ) code with an isotropic kinematic outflow model for agn feedback .",
    "their results reproduced the antihierarchical turnoff in the quasar luminosity function , as well as the spatial distribution of quasars on both small and large scales .",
    "however , the impact of feedback was significantly less than predicted by analogous semianalytic models , a difference that could be traced to in - shock cooling as occurred in they sph simulation .",
    "sijacki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) introduced a dual mode prescription for their agn simulations in gadget-2 , resulting in better agreement between the simulated galaxy stellar mass density and observations than previous models .",
    "booth & schaye ( 2009 ) performed sph simulations using the gadget iii code with a modified version of the agn prescription of springel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and found that the bhs greatly suppressed the star formation in high - mass galaxies , self - regulating their feedback such that they agreed with the @xmath5-@xmath6 relation , a tight correlation between bh mass , @xmath5 and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy s bulge , @xmath6 ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al . 2000 ; tremaine et al .",
    "recently , planelles et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , le brun et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , and pike et al .",
    "( 2014 ) used variants of gadget iii and gadget-2 to study the impact of agn on a range of galaxy masses and clusters , and how agn models can be tuned to produce better agreement between simulated and observed galaxy groups and clusters . finally , barai et al . ( 2013 ) and wurster & thacker ( 2013 ) each used sph simulations ( gadget iii and hydra , respectively ) to consider the impact of various agn feedback models on isolated galaxies and mergers , showing some success in replicating the @xmath5-@xmath6 relation .",
    "all such sph simulations , which use lagrangian schemes to solve the equations of fluid dynamics , are very efficient at resolving dense structures . however , sph is not without its shortcomings . as particles moves along with the mass ,",
    "sph is ill - equipped to resolve the low - density environment surrounding galaxies and clusters , although it is through this medium that the feedback interacts with the surrounding structure .",
    "furthermore , traditional , also called standard , sph has difficulties accurately modeling shocks and mixing ( e.g. , morris 1996 ; marri & white 2003 ; agertz et al . 2007 ; hopkins 2013 ) , which are essential when studying the impact of feedback on surrounding structure .",
    "fortunately , there is on - going effort and success in reformulating the sph method to overcome the mixing and shock issues discussed above ( e.g. , price 2012 ; hopkins 2013 ) , although they have not yet become the standard practice .",
    "thus , recently adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) methods are gaining interest , as amr is a shock - capturing method , it can set high spatial resolution in any region of the simulation volume and resolves shocks with only a few cells .",
    "dubois et al . ( 2010 ) introduced kinematic radio - mode feedback in ramses simulations , and then in dubois et al .",
    "( 2013 ) used both radio and quasar models of agn feedback in the amr code ramses ( teyssier et al . 2002 ) to study the growth of a galaxy cluster in a full cosmological simulation .",
    "their study focused on the accretion history of the cluster smbh and the effect of feedback on the gas content and temperature .",
    "they found that only with agn feedback were they able to greatly heat the gas and affect its ability to accrete onto the central galaxy , thus limiting the overall sfr and accretion on to the smbh , while being in good agreement with the empirical @xmath5-@xmath6 relation .",
    "martizzi et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also used ramses to simulate an isolated cluster halo , studying how quickly cluster gas heated by agn feedback cools back into the central region .    aside from using different hydrodynamical methods , these collection of studies are quite diverse in how they model the deposited feedback energy and its impact on the environment .",
    "thus the role of the simulation method in determining the conclusions of these studies is difficult to disentangle in the absence of a comparison that employs the same physical model across different simulation codes .",
    "the importance of comparisons between simulation techniques has also been highlighted by the usefulness of such studies in models of structure formation without agn feedback .",
    "for example , the santa barbara cluster comparison project @xcite compared the results of twelve numerical codes using the same initial conditions to study the virialization of a massive galaxy cluster , without including feedback or radiative cooling , finding that agreement was best for properties of the dark matter and worst for the total x - ray luminosity",
    ". similar comparisons with higher resolution were done in voit et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and then mitchell et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , focusing on the central entropy profiles of clusters , and they showed that the core entropy was lower in sph than in amr due to under - mixing in sph , and to a lesser degree , over - mixing in amr .",
    "a detailed computational comparison between amr and sph methods for standard hydrodynamic turbulence was performed by @xcite , which demonstrated the inherent difficulties of modeling shear layers with standard sph .",
    "this work also highlighted the effect of steep density gradients in standard sph simulations , where an effective surface tension between the two phases would lead to limited mixing , overcooling , and angular momentum transport ( kaufmann et al . 2007 ) .",
    "code comparisons continue to be important . for the aquila project ,",
    "@xcite studied the formation of a milky way - size galaxy , wherein 13 different numerical methods were used , starting from the same initial conditions , with no attempt to use identical sub - grid models ( gas cooling and the formation and feedback of stars and agn ) .",
    "they found that while the variety of different gas physics led to a large span in the physical characteristics of the final galaxy , it was inconsistent with observations of real galaxies .",
    "they also found that gas cooled more efficiently in grid codes , leading to higher star formation rates .",
    "in contrast to the aquila project , the now underway agora project is combining the works of 95 scientists to use a variety of numerical codes with as identical as possible implementations of various baryonic physics to produce more observationally consistent galaxies ( kim et al .",
    "there has been a suite of work comparing galactic and cosmological simulations from the recently introduced moving - mesh code arepo , with the sph code gadget iii ( e.g. , springel 2010 ; bauer & springel 2012 ; kere et al .",
    "2012 ; sijacki et al . 2012 ; torrey et al .",
    "2012a ; vogelsberger et al .",
    "2012 ; nelson et al .",
    "2013 ) , which only recently included agn feedback ( hayward et al .",
    "these have further demonstrated where shortcomings exist in the ability of sph codes to mix merging material . in particular , kere et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found that with radiative gas cooling arepo had either the same or lower central entropy profiles depending on the halo mass , which is opposite the results of grid codes in non - radiative simulations ( e.g. , voit et al .",
    "2005 ; mitchell et al .",
    "finally , the nifty cosmology workshop has also lead to simulation comparison papers that include amr and sph codes , and the moving mesh code arepo ( sembolini et al .",
    "2015b , 2015a ) . for non - radiative simulations they reproduced the radial profile results of mitchell et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . by introducing cooling and agn feedback , at @xmath7",
    "they see better qualitative agreement in the halo profiles , but with larger scatter .",
    "in this work , we wish to continue the effort to compare the results from different codes as they simulate the cosmologically consistent formation of a cluster environment , including agn feedback .",
    "we perform two simulation suites , one with amr and one with standard sph , from the same initial conditions , studying the impact of different subgrid physics , including cooling , star formation , stellar and agn feedback models .",
    "note that we attempt to implement nearly identical sub - grid baryonic physics models , using the same parameter values in these models to emphasize the role of the numerical method .",
    "we compare the ability of these two numerical methods to model the evolution of the cluster environment and its response to these subgrid models , including the gas temperature , sfrs , and gas content .",
    "we stress that these results are only applicable to standard sph implementations , and future work comparing with non - standard sph implementations is required . in a companion paper ( richardson et al .",
    "2016 in prep ) we compare the amr and sph impact of agn feedback on the characteristics of halos ranging from 10@xmath8 to 10@xmath9 .    the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ methods ] we discuss the cooling , star formation and stellar feedback , and agn formation , accretion , merging and feedback methods in both the grid and particle codes . in  [ results ] we first give a detailed comparison of the results from our non - cooling and our fiducial simulations , where no agn feedback is included .",
    "these constitute the backbone of our analysis , as it is only with respect to these non - agn runs that we can determine how agn affects the cluster growth in amr and sph simulations .",
    "we then present the results from our simulations with agn feedback .",
    "we give a discussion and conclude in  [ concl5 ] .",
    "simulations were conducted with either the amr code ramses @xcite or the sph code hydra @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions were generated using the mpgrafic @xcite package which creates a realization of the density fluctuations on a grid according to the desired power spectrum , and uses the zeldovich approximation to calculate the corresponding particle velocities .",
    "our initial conditions were generated at a redshift of @xmath10 , centered on a region in which a cluster halo with virial mass @xmath11 forms by @xmath7 .",
    "we assumed a @xmath2cdm cosmology with cosmological parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) = ( 0.73 , 0.27 , 0.044 , 0.8 , 0.7 ) from the 7-year _ wmap _ @xcite .",
    "our simulations were carried out in a 100 @xmath17 mpc comoving box with periodic boundaries and were run to @xmath18 . in both particle and grid simulations we assumed a",
    "zoomed - in realization of this box , with a spherical high - resolution region 25 @xmath17 mpc in diameter , an effective dark matter particle number of 1024@xmath19 , and a mass resolution of @xmath20 this high resolution region was selected to contain all particles found in the halo by @xmath21 , and thus constitutes a conservative estimate of the necessary high - resolution region for @xmath18 . outside of the high resolution region , we uniformly decreased the dark matter particle resolution until reaching an effective particle number of 64@xmath19 , for amr , and 128@xmath19 , for sph , in the outer regions of the box . the dark matter particle initial conditions were identical between the grid and particle simulations .",
    "we carried out the grid simulations with the ramses code @xcite , which uses an unsplit second - order godunov scheme for evolving the euler equations for the gas .",
    "ramses  variables are cell - centered and interpolated to the cell faces for flux calculations , which are then used with a harten - lax - van leer - contact riemann solver ( van leer 1979 ; einfeldt 1988 ) . for calculating the gravitational potential and",
    "accelerations , collisionless star , black hole , and dark matter particles had their mass mapped to the grid with a cloud - in - cell ( cic ) scheme ( birdsall & fuss , 1997 ) .",
    "the cic method was also used for comparing gas and particle densities for star formation and sink particle generation , discussed further below .",
    "gas within the high - resolution region was refined using a semi - lagrangian technique .",
    "when more than 8 dark matter particles were in a cell , or when the baryon density in a cell was 8 times more than the cosmic average , the cell was split into 8 , doubling the spatial resolution .",
    "we aimed for a fixed maximum physical resolution of @xmath22 pc , where the maximum refinement level was increased with increasing cosmic scale factor , with increments occurring at @xmath23 39 , 19 , 9 , and 4 .",
    "thus the spatial resolution at any one time varied from 435 physical pc to 870 physical pc . to avoid over - resolving the dark matter in dense gas regions , we set the maximum level to map the dark matter particles into cells at @xmath24 . for comparison , at @xmath25 ,",
    "the gas was refined up to @xmath26 levels of resolution .",
    "thus from @xmath25 to 3 the dark matter had an effective softening length of 2 physical kpc , given by twice the width of grid cell at @xmath27 .",
    "we carried out the particle - based simulations with the hydra code ( couchman et al .",
    "1995 ; thacker & couchman 2006 ) , which uses an adaptive particle - particle , particle - mesh method @xcite to calculate the gravitational forces and an sph method ( gingold & marigold 1977 ; lucy 1977 ) to calculate the hydrodynamic forces .",
    "this is a standard implementation of sph without a forced conservation of entropy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and does not include methods for better capturing contact discontinuities ( e.g. hopkins et al . 2013 ) .",
    "we used the same initial conditions for dark matter as for the ramses run , and overlaid the gas particles onto the dark matter particle positions , which then trace the gas density field .",
    "note , hydra  employs a modification of the kernel gradient to prevent the formation of the pair instability ( thomas & couchman 1992 ) , and where pressure is important we confirm that gas and dm particles separate within a few time steps .",
    "hydra uses the s2 gravitational softening length @xcite , @xmath28 , for mediating close encounter scattering events , with the minimum smoothing length given by @xmath29 .",
    "we set @xmath30 physical pc , giving the same softening length for dark matter particles in the two codes at late redshifts .",
    "although the spatial resolution of a grid or particle method is not exactly equal to these two quantities , we found that the star formation histories were sufficiently similar when relating these parameters in this way .",
    "we discuss this further in  [ sf ] .",
    "each gas particle set its smoothing length such that it overlapped with roughly 52 neighbors , although at any given step this number could vary between 32 and 82 .    optically thin ,",
    "atomic cooling from hydrogen , helium , and metals was calculated following @xcite for temperatures above 10@xmath31 k , and metal fine - structure cooling following @xcite at cooler temperatures .",
    "the gas temperature was not allowed to drop below @xmath32 k via radiative and metal line cooling , although adiabatic cooling below this limit was permitted .",
    "after @xmath33 heating from an ultraviolet background was modeled following @xcite . for simplicity and consistency between codes , the metallicity was set at a constant value of a third solar for the entirety of the simulation , as typically observed in the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "we note that a recently identified error in the cooling prescription in ramses  shows that its metal cooling tables also include the contribution from hydrogen and helium , thus in regions where h and he are the main source of cooling ( e.g. , high temperature synchrotron tail ) we were adding an extra third of cooling ( since this extra term scales with the metallicity ) .",
    "however , for consistency , the same cooling tables were used in the hydra  simulation , thus this error does not account for any differences between the two methods .      in both types of simulations ,",
    "star formation followed a schmidt - kennicut law ( schmidt 1955 ; kennicut 1998 ) , with the star formation rate given as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the star forming efficiency , @xmath36 is the gas mass , and @xmath37 is the gravitational free - fall time in the vicinity of the star - forming region , with @xmath38 the gravitational constant and @xmath39 the gas mass density in a given resolution element .",
    "we set @xmath40 consistent with observations of giant molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "star formation was implemented where the gas density was above a hydrogen number density threshold , sufficient to overcome the local hydrodynamic pressure . for these resolutions",
    ", we set this threshold to be @xmath41 hydrogen atoms @xmath42 .",
    "we also incorporate a baryon overdensity threshold , comparing the local density of gas and stars to dark matter .",
    "this is necessary to prevent star formation from proceeding in cosmic filaments at high redshift . for sph , if the total baryon mass within two smoothing lengths of a gas particle was more than 0.25 that of the enclosed dark matter , then the particle was permitted to proceed with the star formation prescription discussed below . for amr",
    ", we checked on a cell - by - cell case , and required a stricter threshold than sph to ensure the gas in the smaller volume was indeed dominating the local mass .",
    "we allowed this to vary with time since the dark matter softening transitioned to 1 kpc , and ensured agreement with the global star formation rate in the sph simulation in the zoom - region of the box .",
    "this resulted in the gas overdensity threshold ranging from 0.25 to 20 times the dark matter mass in a given cell .",
    "we assumed that cold gas above the density threshold belonged to the multiphase interstellar medium ( ism ) , which we could not resolve . as such",
    "we employed a polytropic equation of state for such gas with @xmath43 , with polytropic index @xmath44 , and ism temperature @xmath32 k. the density is also consistent with particle simulations of similar resolution ( e.g. , mccarthy et al .",
    "2010 ; scannapieco et al .",
    "2012 and references therein ; sijacki et al . 2012",
    "; hayward et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the implementation of star formation in ramses is described in @xcite .",
    "we defined a unit stellar mass , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the proton mass , and @xmath47 is the hydrogen mass fraction .",
    "thus the unit stellar mass is the mass in a cell at the threshold density , and is therefore the minimum stellar mass .",
    "if a cell s gas density was above the star - formation threshold density and overdensity then we used equation  ( [ eqsf ] ) with @xmath48 to determine the amount of stellar mass expected to be created in the next time step . comparing this",
    "expected mass with the unit stellar mass yielded an expected number of stars to be formed , which was used as the expectation value for a random integer drawn from a poisson distribution .",
    "a star particle was then generated with the same velocity as the cell and a mass equal to the random number times the unit stellar mass , and the cell s mass was reduced by the star particle s mass .",
    "the implementation of star formation in hydra is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "each gas particle accumulated a stellar component following equation  ( [ eqsf ] ) , where @xmath49 was that gas particle s mass , and @xmath39 was the local gas density at the particle .",
    "once the accumulated mass was equal to the star particle mass , which we set to be half the high - resolution gas particle mass , a star particle was formed , and the gas particle s mass was equivalently reduced . until the time at which a star was formed , the gas dynamics used the total gas particle mass , not just the non - stellar component .",
    "the only exception to this was that the mass in equation  ( [ eqsf ] ) only included the non - stellar component of the gas particle .",
    "once a gas particle that already made one star particle had converted 80% of its remaining mass into stars , then that entire gas particle was turned into a second star particle .    in figure  [ figcsf ]",
    "we compare the history of star formation for the two codes in a 25 @xmath17 comoving mpc sphere centered on the region of interest .",
    "the varying resolution of the ramses  runs is manifested by the delay in star formation shortly before an increase in maximum refinement level , occurring at roughly @xmath50 and @xmath25 .",
    "while for @xmath51 there was fairly good agreement before using the overdensity threshold discussed above , the inclusion of this threshold results in stars forming only in galaxy cores .",
    "we assumed @xmath52 of the stellar mass formed was contained in high - mass stars that contributed feedback through type ii supernovae ( sne ) , with 10@xmath53 erg of energy released for 10 @xmath54 of high - mass stars ( i.e. per 100 @xmath54 of total stars ) .",
    "we thus used a total efficiency of @xmath55 erg g@xmath56 ( sommer - larsen et al .",
    "this energy was deposited immediately into the vicinity of the formed star particle .",
    "although the typical lifetime of a high - mass star was on order tens of time - steps , our single particle is representative of several giant molecular clouds , and we expect little issue to arise from injecting this energy without a delay at those kpc resolutions ( see wurster & thacker 2013 ) .",
    "the implementation of the stellar feedback in ramses is described in @xcite .",
    "this energy was deposited kinematically with a radius of a single cell around the star particle .",
    "the injected mass , momentum , and energy are consistent with a sedov blast wave solution .",
    "the implementation of the stellar feedback in hydra is described in @xcite .",
    "since particle positions are not isotropic , we injected this energy thermally , using a kernel weighting for gas particles within the star particle s former smoothing length .",
    "post - feedback cooling uses a multiphase description of the gas density , which is much lower than the cold gas . in this model , pressure equilibrium",
    "is assumed , and the resulting decrease in density is determined by the net energy increase . in this way , the method is similar to other delayed cooling schemes ( see for example gerritsen & icke 1997 ) .",
    "this multiphase density then gradually returns to the particle density , set by a half - life time of 1 myr , consistent with the time for the blast wave to reach the cooling radius for densities near our star - formation threshold and feedback energy @xcite .",
    "black holes ( bhs ) were modeled as sink particles in both types of simulations , and they were formed where the local gas and stellar density were both above the star formation criteria , @xmath57 .",
    "all bhs had a seed mass of @xmath58 , and to ensure only one bh was made per galaxy , they were only allowed to form in locations at least 30 comoving kpc from all other bhs . in ramses , this particle was given the same momentum as its cell of origin , and the cell s mass was reduced by the seed mass . in hydra ,",
    "the bhs were spawned at the same location and with the same momentum as the source gas particle , and the gas mass was reduced by the seed mass .",

    "these differences are visibile in the temperature projections and slices shown in the middle and right panels of figure  [ fig_fid_images5 ] , and are much more apparent than in the nc comparison runs shown in figure  [ fig_adiab_images ] . thus the increased post - shock temperature and slightly wider shock in sph ( e.g. , hubber et al . 2013 ) leads to a lower cooling rate .",

    "the authors argued that the moving mesh was capturing a cooling flow , and thus sph was not capturing sufficient cooling in the gas .",

    "the introduction of agn feedback results in very little apparent impact on the density distribution at this redshift .",
    "this is mostly due to only a 30% drop in overall gas fraction , which is difficult to see with the scale spanning 6 orders of magnitude .",
    "however , under close comparison with figure  [ fig_fid_images5 ] , we see that the densest regions in the qso  runs have the largest decrement in density compared with the fid  runs , while the filaments inside the cluster are somewhat denser . in amr",
    "we see that the filaments are slightly pushed off - center , and are thinner . in sph",
    ", there is a lower number of collapsed clumps , suggesting that the feedback is offsetting the numerical dissipation .",
    "finally , the diffuse halo medium inside the virial radius is slightly denser with agn .",
    "thus , while by @xmath81 agn feedback is not effective in moving large amounts of matter out of the cluster environment , it does reduce the central densest peaks and delay gas accretion into the halo .    the middle and right columns of figure  [ fig_qso_images5 ] present projections and slices of the gas temperature , respectively .",
    "while agn feedback does not affect the gas density , it clearly affects the gas temperature . in both simulation types ,",
    "the agn feedback results in a larger volume of hot gas than in the fid  runs , with an increase in the hot gas volume - filling factor of roughly 10 , and a virial shock radius well beyond the virial radius .",
    "however , note that in both fid  and qso  simulations the amount of heated gas is consistently greater for the sph simulations .",
    "given that more gas is heated in sph , it is thus surprising that the temperature slices reveal that the two methods give a consistent picture of the halo gas ( within the white circle ) .",
    "the halo virial radii are 66 physical kpc and 70 physical kpc for amr - qso  and sph - qso , respectively , and within the halo the gas is nearly uniform at the virial temperature of @xmath132 k. although the amr filaments are more continuous than in sph , similar to what is seen in the fid  simulations , the cold filaments in amr - qso  truncate at a larger radius than in amr - fid  and point slightly away from the center of the cluster .",
    "the filaments truncation radius is signified by a second shock located at the virial radius .",
    "thus , although it is not visible in the large - scale projections , the agn is impacting filament gas on small scales in the amr simulation , which is also seen in higher resolution runs in dubois et al .",
    "we do not see a similar impact on the filaments in sph however , and this is consistent with what is seen in di matteo et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "we interpret the similarity of the amr and sph halo gas as follows : although the injection scale of the agn feedback for the two methods is not identical , the agn eventually heats the halo gas sufficiently to self - regulate its accretion , and this self - regulating gas configuration occurs at a `` critical entropy '' ( oh & benson 2003 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ) . we find that this critical entropy is largely code independent .",
    "however , it is clear that sph causes more collateral gas heating , such that the gas at very large radii is heated to @xmath133 k in the process of increasing the halo gas to the same critical entropy .",
    "this becomes much clearer at @xmath82 as discussed below .    beyond the halo",
    ", we see that the intergalactic medium in the sph simulation is significantly cooler than in the amr simulation .",
    "this difference is unfortunately caused by an erroneous switch that turned off reionization heating for gas below 500 k in our sph - qso  simulation .",
    "however , the shock increases the temperature in amr by three orders of magnitude , and therefore the fact that the igm gas is artificially cooled results in little impact on the halo itself .",
    "the impact of agn feedback on the gas profiles of the cluster environment at @xmath81 are presented in figure  [ fig_qso_prof5 ] .",
    "even though the temperature projections show a strong signature of agn feedback in both simulations , the average profiles in this figure are largely similar to the fiducial cases shown in figure  [ fig_fid_prof5 ] . however , in the qso  simulations , the distribution of gas at very high entropies has increased , extending roughly an order of magnitude higher than in figure  [ fig_fid_prof5 ] , with the largest increases occurring at very small radii ( @xmath134 physical kpc ) and very large radii ( @xmath135 physical kpc ) . additionally , the inclusion of agn has resulted in less low entropy gas at 10 - 20 kpc in the amr simulation , while in the sph simulation there is less low - entropy gas ( @xmath136 0.001 kev @xmath1 ) at all radii , but more mid - entropy gas ( @xmath137 0.1 kev @xmath1 ) at 5 - 20 physical kpc . finally , by comparing the qso  results with the non - radiative profile given in voit et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we see that the inclusion of agn feedback has resulted in a higher average entropy value at all radii for amr , and a higher average entropy for the central gas in the sph case .    agn feedback acts to diminish the sph and amr central density values and average values , bringing the two methods into better agreement .",
    "however , the hot sph gas extends to higher densities , indicative of a very recent feedback event in which the gas has not yet had an opportunity to expand . this central , hot , feature is visible in the insets shown in figure  [ fig_qso_images5 ] , which also show the presence of more cool gas in sph , explaining the lower entropy profile .",
    "overall there is much better agreement between the two methods than in the fid  runs , where the agn heating results in similarly increased entropy profiles necessary for self - regulating their accretion .",

    "this increase in high entropy , hot gas is also shown in the one - dimensional pdf plots of temperature , which illustrate that in the amr case the agn heat less gas but this gas is heated to higher entropies and temperatures than in the sph case .",

    "projections of gas density and projections and slices of gas temperature out to 8 @xmath118 are shown in figure  [ fig_qso_images3 ] .",
    "we see the same small effects as at @xmath81 .",
    "thus , even at later times when agn have a larger impact , thermal feedback does not lead to large - scale redistribution of gas .",
    "the temperature projections now present significantly more extended hot gas , which , if we consider all gas heated above the typical igm temperature of @xmath142 k , is more volume filling in sph . however ,",
    "if we consider the region with projected temperature above @xmath143 k , then we again see that there is fairly good agreement between the two methods .",
    "this region in sph is only slightly larger and reaches temperatures only slightly hotter than in amr .",
    "thus we find that the methods produce a halo gas temperature distribution that is much more consistent than in the @xmath18 fid  runs and the qso  runs at @xmath81 .",

    "this agreement on intermediate and large - scales aside , the inserts , showing the gas density and temperature in the inner 0.2@xmath118 , do show a few differences . thus while the agn feedback acts to make the bulk of the halo material consistent thermodynamically , on smaller scales the gas is impacted differently . in sph there is a more centrally collapsed , hot , gas clump , which is broader in density than in temperature , and whose outskirts are denser than its interior .",
    "this region is in the process of a feedback - driven expansion , leading to a shock front with higher density and therefore increased cooling .",

    "the gas density peaks outside of the center at roughly 4 physical kpc , where entropy drops .",
    "we have confirmed that this is not due to an improper choice of halo center .    on intermediate and large scales in figure  [ fig_qso_prof3 ]",
    "there is again better agreement between the two methods . outside of the central clump",
    ", the agn has led to a much larger amount of gas at high entropy at large radii , compared with the fid  simulations in figure  [ fig_fid_prof3 ] . within the virial radius , the average entropy and density profiles are even more consistent than in the fid  and @xmath81 qso  runs .",
    "given that in sph there is a central clump with higher density , we would expect to see lower entropy in the core of the sph halo .",

    "a more detailed study of the angular momentum of the different gas phases is beyond the scope of this work .    at small radii",

    "additionally , it is possibly that the more collimated filament streams in amr incur more sam from tidal torques since it has a high quadrupole moment ( e.g. , danovich 2015 ) , which is also weakly supported at high @xmath156 and large radii .",
    "the inclusion of agn feedback also leads to markedly different behavior in the inner region for the two methods . in sph",

    "the star formation rate is consistently lower in sph , but grows faster than in amr .",
    "since the rate is lower , there is more gas present at later times from which to form stars in sph . for the fid",

    "since the star formation rate is lower in the sph runs , it takes longer before the stellar density reaches the threshold to trigger the formation of a bh .",
    "thus , the sph bhs form later and are less massive at very high redshifts .",
    "since bhs are generated at the limit of density resolution , this could be a large source of discrepancy between the two codes .",
    "it is thus very interesting that the halo environment is so similar at late times . due to the delayed formation ,",
    "the sph bhs total growth rate is near eddington , until the bh masses approaches that of their amr counterparts , at which point the growth rates are in good agreement , consistent within a factor of two in absolute terms , or roughly the same value relative to their eddington rate .",
    "this is consistent with the agns entering the self regulation phase . at @xmath161",
    "a medium - sized sph black hole falls into a clump ( see figure  [ fig_qso_images3 ] ) , where its accretion increases very quickly .",
    "this accretion will remain high until the pressure is increased enough to turn off accretion , and this is what occurs at @xmath18 in figure  [ fig_qso_prof3 ] . during the period of best agreement between the two methods , @xmath162",
    ", we note that the baryon fractions are also in very good agreement ( see figure  [ fig_halo_evo ] ) , but we see almost no correlation between the sfr during this time .",
    "unfortunately , without sampling the star formation over smaller intervals , we are unable to determine whether fluctuations in star formation correlate with fluctuations in black hole accretion , suggested in other works ( e.g. , dubois et al .",
    "thus , for a self - regulation scenario , constraining agn feedback with simulations will not come from the characteristics of the halo environment , but by the characteristics of the black holes themselves , their agreement with observed empirical relations , and the impact of agn on the igm and surrounding structure .",
    "to better understand the impact of agn feedback on the formation and evolution of a large cluster and how this evolution can be biased by numerical effects , we have simulated the growth of a cluster from identical initial conditions in two different numerical methods . using the amr code ramsesand the sph code hydra  we have attempted to match their radiative cooling , star formation , stellar feedback , and their black hole formation , growth , and energetic feedback processes , with the caveat that the fundamental differences between the methods will make modeling even simple structure formation not necessarily identical . by comparing these simulations with successively more complex baryonic physics ,",
    "we have observed the following key points :    * regardless of the treatment of baryonic processes , sph consistently has a lower central entropy profile than amr , with the sole exception being directly after an energetic feedback event . while this has been seen before for non - radiative simulations , comparisons with moving mesh codes",
    "have suggested that sph codes may have higher central entropy profiles .",
    "* gas that is heated by the virial shock can efficiently cool at high redshift in simulations , although this cooling may not be captured numerically if an artificial viscosity is employed or if the shock width is not well resolved .",
    "future work studying the resolution dependence of this feature will shed further light on this issue .",
    "* agn feedback reduces the baryonic fraction of halos by roughly 30% , regardless of the numerical method .",
    "the baryon fraction is highly dependent on the location of the virial shock , as it sets the bottleneck for subsequent baryonic accretion .",
    "* agn feedback leads to better agreement between the two methods on the thermal state of the halo gas , consistent with a picture of self - regulation .",
    "regardless of the numerical method , the agn will accrete matter until moving most of the gas to entropies of roughly 100 kev @xmath1 , at which point subsequent accretion diminishes . *",
    "we see hints of agn feedback impacting the termination point and orientation of filamentary cold flows in amr , acting to push these streams beyond the impact radius of the agn . in sph ,",
    "the filaments are more discrete , allowing the agn heated gas to escape around the flows , with little impact on their location or orientation .",
    "this may also explain the decrease in angular momentum of the central halo in amr .",
    "* agn feedback leads to a reduction in the total star formation rate of the cluster halo , by up to an order of magnitude by @xmath18 .",

    "<S> we perform adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) and smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) cosmological zoom simulations of a region around a forming galaxy cluster , comparing the ability of the methods to handle successively more complex baryonic physics . in the simplest , non - radiative case , </S>",
    "<S> the two methods are in good agreement with each other , but the sph simulations generate central cores with slightly lower entropies and virial shocks at slightly larger radii , consistent with what has been seen in previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of radiative cooling , star formation , and stellar feedback leads to much larger differences between the two methods . most dramatically , at @xmath0 rapid cooling in the amr case moves the accretion shock well within the virial radius , while this shock remains near the virial radius in the sph case , due to excess heating , coupled with poorer capturing of the shock width . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the addition of feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to the simulations results in much better agreement between the methods . in this case both simulations display halo gas entropies of 100 kev @xmath1 , similar decrements in the star - formation rate , and a drop in the halo baryon content of roughly 30% . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with agn growth being self - regulated , regardless of the numerical method . </S>",
    "<S> however , the simulations with agn feedback continue to differ in aspects that are not self - regulated , such that in sph a larger volume of gas is impacted by feedback , and the cluster still has a lower entropy central core . </S>"
