    "understanding the origin of the cosmic ray ( cr ) energy spectrum is central to astrophysics and has long been the focus of intensive study .",
    "the spectrum of cr nuclei at @xmath010@xmath110@xmath2gev / nucleon is thought to be the result of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) mechanisms in supernova remnants ( snr ) , followed by diffusive propagation in the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .",
    "the conventional descriptions predict source spectra such as @xmath3 for primary nuclei ( _ e.g. _ , , ) which are steepened as @xmath4 by diffusion .",
    "the data constrain @xmath52.7 ( depending on the element ) and @xmath60.20.7 , whereby @xmath72.02.5 . in dsa calculations ,",
    "the source spectral slope should be @xmath82.2 , which implies @xmath90.5 .",
    "on the other hand , large values for @xmath10 are at odds with the anisotropy observations at tev energies , which favor @xmath110.3 . on top of that , recent experiments atic-2 , cream , and pamela , reported a remarkable spectral hardening at energies above @xmath0100gev / nucleon which can not be explained by conventional mechanisms @xcite .",
    "proposed explanations of this effect deal with acceleration mechanisms @xcite , nearby snrs @xcite or multi - source populations @xcite .",
    "i propose here that the hardening originates from a spatial change of the cr diffusion properties in the different regions of the galactic halo .",
    "the key hypotesis is that the diffusion coefficient @xmath12 is not separable into energy and space terms as usually assumed .",
    "as i will show , this hypotesis leads to a pronounced change in slope for the energy spectra of cr nuclei at earth , giving a good description of the present data .",
    "remarkably , the model proposed here has also positive impacts on several open problems in the cr acceleration / propagation physics .",
    "i use a one - dimensional inhomogeneus diffusion model for cr transport and interactions @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is modeled to be a disc ( half - thickness @xmath13100pc ) containing the gas ( number density @xmath141@xmath15 ) and the cr sources .",
    "the disc is surrounded by a diffusive halo ( half - thickness @xmath165kpc ) with zero matter density . for each stable cr nucleus , the transport equation is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is its number density as function of the @xmath19-coordinate , @xmath20 is the position - dependent diffusion coefficient and @xmath21 is the destruction rate in the ism at velocity @xmath22 and cross section @xmath23 .",
    "the source term @xmath24 is split into a primary term @xmath25 , from snrs , and a secondary production term @xmath26 , from spallation of heavier ( @xmath27 ) nuclei with rate @xmath28 .",
    "the quantities @xmath29 , @xmath12 , @xmath24 and @xmath30 depend on energy too .",
    "equation[eq::transport1d ] can be solved in steady - state conditions ( @xmath31 ) with the boundary conditions @xmath32 @xcite . for each cr nucleus",
    ", the differential energy spectrum is given by : @xmath33 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath34@xmath35@xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38@xmath35@xmath39 . in cr propagation studies ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient is usually assumed to be separable as @xmath40 ( in homogeneus models @xmath411 , whereby @xmath42 ) . in these models ,",
    "the functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are independent on energy , so that the predictions at earth ( @xmath19@xmath45@xmath46 ) are spectrally uninfluenced by the choice of @xmath47 .",
    "conversely , i employ a non - separable @xmath48 , which reflects the existence of different cr transport properties in the propagation volume , depending on the nature and scale distribution of the magnetic - field irregularities .",
    "in fact , while snr explosions may generate large irregularities in the region near the galactic plane , the situation in the outer halo is different because that medium is undisturbed by snrs . from these considerations , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite found that the turbulence spectrum in the halo should be flatter than that in the galactic plane .",
    "this implies a strong latitudinal dependence for the parameter @xmath10 , which suggests spatial variations of the cr energy spectra .",
    "noticeably , new data reported by _",
    "fermi_/lat on the diffuse @xmath49-ray emission at @xmath010100gev of energy seem to support these suggestions : the @xmath49-ray spectra observed near the galactic plane ( latitude @xmath508@xmath51 ) are found to be harder than those at higher latitudes @xcite . following the above arguments ,",
    "i adopt a simple _ two - halo model _ consisting in two diffusive zones .",
    "the _ inner halo _ is taken to surround the disk for a typical size @xmath52 of a few hundred pc ( @xmath530.1 ) .",
    "its medium properties are influenced by snrs , which produce a steep turbulence spectrum in terms of energy density per wave number , @xmath54 , presumably close to the kolmogorov regime @xmath551/3 .",
    "the _ outer halo _ represents a wider region , @xmath56 , which is undisturbed by snrs .",
    "its turbulence spectrum is driven by crs and should be flatter .",
    "for instance , crs with rigidity spectrum @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 ) excite turbulent modes of wave - numbers @xmath59 , giving a spectrum @xmath0@xmath60 , where @xmath61 is of the order of the unity .",
    "this situation can be realized by a rigidity dependent diffusion coefficient of the type @xmath62 where @xmath630.04kpc / myr specifies its normalization at the reference rigidity @xmath645gv . for @xmath65 , the diffusion coefficient of eq.[eq::twohalodiffcoeff ]",
    "produces a higher cr confinement in the inner halo ( with @xmath551/3 ) , whereas the outer halo ( with @xmath660.5  1 ) represents a _ reservoir _ from which crs leak out rapidly and can re - enter the inner halo .",
    "the non - separability of @xmath12 has a remarkable consequence on the model predictions at @xmath67 .",
    "it can be understood if one neglects the term @xmath30 and takes a source term @xmath68 . from eq.[eq::solutionvsz ] and using eq.[eq::twohalodiffcoeff ] , one finds @xmath69 which describes the cr spectrum as a result of two components .",
    "its differential log - slope as a function of rigidity reads @xmath70 which shows a clear transition between two regimes . in practice the low - energy regime ( @xmath71 )",
    "is never reached due to spallation , that becomes relevant and even dominant over escape ( @xmath72 ) . in this case",
    "the log - slope is better approximated by @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "the hard high - energy regime ( @xmath74 ) is determined by the diffusion properties of the inner halo only . in this limit",
    "one has @xmath75 .",
    "the effect vanishes at all rigidities when passing to the homogeneus limit of @xmath76 ( one - halo ) or @xmath77 ( identical halos ) , where one recovers the usual relation @xmath78 . from eq.[eq::solutionvsz ] , it can be seen that the intensity of the harder component diminishes gradually with increasing @xmath79 , _",

    "the implementation of the model follows refs.@xcite .",
    "the source spectra are taken as @xmath80 , with @xmath812.3 for @xmath82 and @xmath812.16 for @xcite .",
    "the two halos are defined by @xmath165kpc and @xmath830.5kpc .",
    "a kolmogorov - type diffusion is adopted for the inner halo ( @xmath841/3 ) , while @xmath85 is taken as 0.55 , consistently with ref.@xcite .",
    "results from the two - halo model ( solid lines ) are compared with those from the homogeneus model ( dashed lines ) , which uses @xmath840.6 , and with recent cr data .",
    "below @xmath010gev / nucleon , the solar modulation is apparent and it is described using a _ force - field _ modulation potential @xmath86400mv @xcite . note that my model may be inadequate in this energy region due to approximations .",
    "remarkably , my model reproduce well the observed changes in slope at @xmath87100gev , in good agreement with the trend indicated by the data .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the sharp spectral structures suggested by the pamela data at @xmath0300gev can not be recovered .",
    "figure[fig::ccresults]c shows the mean logarithmic mass , @xmath88 , which is described well by the two - halo model .",
    "figure[fig::ccresults]d shows the ratio from the two - halo model , which is predicted to harden as @xmath89 , while its low - energy behavior is similar to that of the homogeneus model ( with @xmath900.6 in the whole halo ) .",
    "interestingly , a slight flattening for the ratio is also suggested by recent data , _",
    "e.g. _ , from tracer . a multi - channel study of the data will allow to resolutely test these features .",
    "the ratio hardening is also connected with the global large - scale anisotropy amplitude , which should increases as @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "thus , the two - halo model predicts a gradual flattening of @xmath92 , as indicated by the present data .",
    "it is also interesting noticing that the anisotropy may be furtherly reduced at all energies if one accounts for a proper radial dependence for @xmath12 @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the model i proposed is potentially able to reconcile a weak energy dependent of the anisotropy amplitude ( as suggested by observations ) with relatively hard source spectra @xmath932.2 ( as preferred by the dsa theory ) , giving good fits to the ratio .",
    "i recall that plain diffusion models employ @xmath932.2 and @xmath940.5 in the whole halo ( which gives a too strong energy dependence for @xmath92 ) , whereas diffusive - reacceleration models use @xmath932.4 and @xmath941/3 ( which are too challenging for the dsa and require strong reacceleration to match the data ) .",
    "i have shown that the spectral hardening observed in crs may be consequence of a galactic diffusion coefficient that is not separable in energy and space terms . from the model presented here ,",
    "the hardening arises naturally as a local effect and vanishes gradually in the outer halo , where the cr spectra are also predicted to be steeper .",
    "this effect must be experienced by all cr nuclei as well as by secondary - to - primary ratios .",
    "recent data from _ fermi_/lat and tracer seem to support this scenario , but the change in slope predicted by this model is more gradual than that suggested by pamela data .",
    "all these features can be tested with the data forthcoming by , so that the present model will be discriminated against other interpretations .",
    "this scenario has an interesting impact on the cr physics .",
    "as shown , a kolmogorov diffusion for the inner halo ( @xmath551/3 ) is consistent with relatively hard source spectra ( @xmath72.2 ) , giving good descriptions of both the ratio and the high - energy trend of the anisotropy amplitude .",
