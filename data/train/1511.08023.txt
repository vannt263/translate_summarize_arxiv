    "all the three bases are parametrized by collections of mutually non - intersecting arcs and closed loops , and all their elements are _ positive _ , i.e. the expansion of any basis element in any cluster is a laurent monomial with non - negative coefficients .    in the present paper ,",

    "the bracelet basis of the cluster algebra of the affine type @xmath0 is atomic .",
    "recently , gross , hacking , keel and kontsevich  @xcite constructed a canonical positive _ theta _",
