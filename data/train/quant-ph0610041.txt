    "time - of - flight measurements are a standard tool for many experimentalists . since the particles or atoms involved are usually fast , their center - of - mass motion is typically treated classically , yielding a simple description of the time - of - flight measurement . but as the diffraction and interference experiments using temporal ( instead of spatial ) slits of szriftgiser et .",
    "al have shown @xcite , such a description of the center - of - mass motion by means of classical physics is not always sufficient : the advance of cooling techniques has made it possible to create ultracold gases in a trap and produce very slow atoms , e.g. , by opening the trap .",
    "whenever such ultracold atoms are involved , the spatial extent and the spreading of the wave function can show noticeable effects .",
    "even the seemingly simple question of the time spent by a particle in a given region of space does not possess a simple and definite answer .",
    "related to this `` dwell - time '' problem are the problems of `` passage time , '' concentrating on those particles that actually cross the region of interest and are not reflected , and `` tunneling time '' in the case of a barrier that classically can not be traversed inside the region of interest .",
    "these problems have on one hand been treated axiomatically aiming at ideal quantities relying only on the system of interest , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "other approaches may be called `` operational '' in the sense that a sort of `` measurement device '' is introduced to which the system of interest is coupled ; see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . for a critical review on different approaches to tunneling times",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .    a distinction that can be drawn between the various time - related quantities recalled above concerns whether they are pre- or post- decoherence . since the present work models the measurement apparatus , it can be thought of as post - decoherence ; in fact it is one of our objectives to include decoherence - inducing processes , thereby eliminating some of the black magic of quantum measurement . on the other hand",
    ", one can take , for example , a path integral approach to tunneling time @xcite in which the paths are sorted by ( variously defined ) times spent in the barrier region .",
    "for these paths , amplitudes are retained , so it is very much a pre - decoherence calculation . as a result interpretive issues arise ( discussed for example by @xcite ) which do not enter in the present work .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate a particular measurement scheme for passage times , mimicking the way a time - of - flight experiment is typically performed : employing a particular spin - boson detector model for measuring quantum arrival times investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , our measurement scheme involves two measurements of arrival time by means of this detector , one upon entering the region of interest and one when exiting ; see fig .",
    "[ passage_setup ] .",
    "this scheme can be expected to distort the particle s wave function less than a scheme based on the continuous coupling of the particle to a measurement device .",
    "indeed , it will be seen that a passage - time measurement by means of `` slow '' detectors yields a rather broad passage - time distribution . but",
    "detectors responding quickly to the presence of the particle also yield a broad distribution .",
    "this will be shown to be a quantum effect involving the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "however , there is an intermediate range for the detector parameters yielding optimal results . in the best case",
    "the precision of the measurement can be estimated to behave like @xmath0 , improving the results obtained from clock models @xcite .    in sec .",

    "we briefly review the detector model introduced in refs . @xcite and the arrival - time distribution obtained from this model in ref .",
    "the detector consists of a three - dimensional array of spins with ferromagnetic interaction in a metastable state .",
    "the spins are weakly coupled to the environment , modeled as a bath of bosons .",
    "the effect of the particle to be observed is to strongly enhance the spin - bath coupling when the particle s wave function overlaps with that of a spin .",
    "thus when the particle is close to a spin , this spin flips with strongly increased probability due to the enhanced spin - bath coupling . by means of the ferromagnetic interaction , this in turn triggers the subsequent spontaneous flipping of the neighboring spins , and finally , by a domino effect , of all spins , even in the absence of the particle .",
    "in this way , the single spin flip induced by the presence of the particle is amplified to a macroscopic event , and either the change in the detector state or in the bath state can be measured .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model is @xmath2 where we use the following definitions : @xmath3 is the free hamiltonian of the particle ; @xmath4 with @xmath5 denoting the excited state of the @xmath6 spin and @xmath7 is the free hamiltonian of the detector ; @xmath8 is the energy difference between ground state and excited state of the @xmath6 spin , and @xmath9 is the coupling energy between the spins @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "further , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the annihilation operator for a boson with wave vector @xmath14 , is the free hamiltonian of the environment , modeled as a bath of bosons , and @xmath15 with @xmath16 and the coupling constants @xmath17 and the phases @xmath18 depending on the particular realization of the detector and the bath , describes the permanent spin - bath coupling .",
    "the spin - bath coupling is strongly enhanced in the particle s presence due to @xmath19 with @xmath20 thus , the enhanced coupling of the @xmath6 spin to the bath is proportional to a sensitivity function @xmath21 which vanishes outside the region @xmath22 where the @xmath6 spin is located .",
    "an example would be the characteristic function which is @xmath23 on @xmath22 and zero outside .",
    "it will be assumed in the sequel that the markov property [ see eq .",
    "( [ markov ] ) ] holds in an appropriate continuum limit .",
    "initially , the system is prepared in the state @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ground state of the bath ( no bosons present ) , and @xmath26 denotes the spatial wave function of the particle . for the @xmath8 only slightly above the energetic threshold set by the ferromagnetic spin - spin coupling , and @xmath17 sufficiently small , the probability of a spontaneous spin flip ( false positive ) is very small @xcite .",
    "but when the particle is close to the @xmath6 spin , the excited state @xmath5 decays much more quickly , due to the enhanced coupling , `` @xmath27 , '' of the spin to the bath .",
    "then , the ferromagnetic force experienced by its neighbors is strongly reduced , and these spins can therefore flip rather quickly , even in the absence of the particle , by means of the @xmath17 .",

    "the bath modes were indexed by wave vectors @xmath28 and the coupling constants were assumed to be of the form @xmath29 with @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 we introduce `` modified resonance frequencies '' @xmath33 which incorporate the ferromagnetic spin - spin coupling .",
    "the correlation function @xmath34 is defined by @xmath35 and similarly for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",

    "an example for such a model would be the detection by means of laser induced fluorescence . in that case , the reset state after the detection of the first fluorescence photon explicitely incorporates a recoil due to the momentum of the emitted photon @xcite .",
    "it appears reasonable that in the present model no such recoil on the particle occurs : after all , the boson is emitted not by the particle but by the spin lattice .",
    "hence , the recoil should be experienced by this lattice , rather than by the particle , similar to what occurs in the mssbauer effect .",
    "of course , the projection of the wave packet onto the detector region by means of the reset operation also changes the momentum distribution of the wave packet .",
    "after detection of a boson , the further interaction of the particle with the detector depends on the particular choice of parameters of the detector model .",
    "the internal dynamics of the detector after the first spin flip has been investigated in detail in refs.@xcite . based on these results , several choices are possible such that the amplification of the first spin flip will not significantly change the spatial wave function after the first spin flip , @xmath137 .",
    "this means that effectively only one reset operation , associated with the very first spin flip , has to be performed on the spatial wave function .",
    "such `` minimally invasive '' detector models will be of interest if one is interested in actual quantum mechanical limitations of a passage - time measurement .",
    "as a simple example , consider a ring of identical spins with nearest - neighbor interaction , @xmath138 with @xmath139 kronecker s @xmath140 , @xmath141 as before , and @xmath142 identified with @xmath143 .",
    "the rate for the neighbors of the first - flipped spin to flip into _ their _ ground state is denoted by @xmath144 and is given by the right side of eq .",

    "if this time is very short , as one can achieve by making @xmath91 large ( while @xmath90 remains small to prevent spontaneous spin flips before the first particle - induced spin flip ) , the reset operations associated with these subsequent spin flips will not significantly change the particle s state since the wave function has been projected onto the detector by the first reset operation already .    another possibility to prevent the spatial wave function from being changed by the amplification process would be to couple only one spin to the particle , by choosing @xmath149 in eq .",
    "( [ general_coupling ] ) .",
    "( in fact , this is the _ de facto _ setup of the detector actually investigated in refs .",

    "we now consider two detectors separated by some distance .",
    "as indicated in the preceding section , we assume that the amplification of the first spin flip to a macroscopic event is very fast and does not change the spatial wave function .",

    "then , the joint probability density for the first detector detecting the particle at @xmath150 _ and _ the second one detecting it at @xmath151 is given by @xmath152 where the superscripts indicate the detector under consideration and the second argument is the initial state for which the respective probability density is calculated . since @xmath153 is bilinear in the wave function",

    "the initial wave packet is prepared in the remote past far away from the detector such that the free wave packet ( with no detectors present ) would be described at @xmath100 by a gaussian minimal uncertainty packet around @xmath156 with @xmath157 and average velocity @xmath158 .",

    "it is seen that small and large values of @xmath125 give rise to rather broad distributions , while the intermediate value yields a narrower one .",
    "the reason for the broad distribution arising for small @xmath125 can be understood by looking at the arrival - time distribution measured by the first detector ( see fig .",
    "[ arrival_fig ] ) : it is already this distribution which is rather broad for small @xmath125 .    physically , small @xmath125 means that the detector is responding only slowly to the presence of the particle ; the undetected amplitude @xmath44 decays only slowly , yielding a broad arrival - time distribution at each of the two detectors and consequently a broad passage - time distribution . in other words ,",
    "the poor quality of the passage - time measurement arises from the poor quality of the individual arrival - time measurements .",
    "the measurement of the arrival time , however , can be improved by making @xmath125 large , that is , by making the detector responding faster to the presence of the particle . in fig .",
    "[ arrival_fig ] it is seen , e.g. , that for @xmath165 one comes much closer to kijowski s arrival - time distribution ; this in turn is known to have minimum standard deviation among all those distributions fulfilling certain axioms transferred to quantum mechanics from classical arrival - time distributions @xcite , and thus provides a sort of `` ideal distribution . ''    while the broad passage - time distribution for small @xmath125 can be understood simply as due to the poor quality of the individual measurements , the broad distribution for large @xmath125 is more interesting .",
    "it can be understood looking at the reset state immediately after the detection by the first detector .",
    "of course , this reset state depends on the instant of time when the detection took place ; as an example , we consider detection times @xmath166 if @xmath167 and @xmath168 if @xmath169 , which are close to the maximum of the respective probability distribution @xmath63 ( see fig .  [ arrival_fig ] ) .",
    "the reset states and the free packet at the respective times are shown in fig .",
    "[ reset_x ] .",
    "it is seen that the fast detection has a strong impact on the wave function .",
    "large @xmath125 means that @xmath44 , in particular that part of @xmath44 which overlaps with the detector , decays very fast .",
    "but since the reset state ( [ state ] ) immediately after the detection is essentially the projection of @xmath44 onto the detector region , the fast decay of this overlap yields a reset state which is very narrow in position space , located at the very beginning of the detector .",
    "thus , by the heisenberg uncertainty relation , it is very broad in momentum space as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ reset_k ] .",
    "it is intuitively clear that such a broad momentum distribution immediately after the measurement of the entry time by the first detector yields a broad passage - time distribution .",
    "so the broad passage - time distribution in case of large @xmath125 is due to the strong distortion of the wave function by the first measurement .",
    "since the broad momentum distribution of the typical reset states in this case is enforced by the heisenberg uncertainty relation , this is a pure quantum effect .",
    "in refs .  @xcite a measurement scheme for passage times was investigated , based on the ( semi- ) continuous coupling of a particle to a clock .",
    "it was argued in these references that the precision of the measurement behaves like @xmath1 where @xmath170 denotes the kinetic energy of the particle .",
    "one now may wonder whether or not the @xmath1 behavior is a fundamental quantum limit for measuring passage times .",
    "we argue that this is not the case since the present measurement scheme by means of two spatially separated detectors yields , for optimal parameter choices , passage - time densities with widths behaving like @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for low energies , we have an example which breaks the @xmath1 limitation of the clock model .      in this subsection",
    "we give an estimate for the width of the passage - time density obtained from the present measurement scheme .",
    "we assume that the detectors can be described by the continuum limit and that transmission and reflection without detection are negligible .",
    "this assumption is justified in the examples of the preceding section , which employed rectangular sensitivity functions .",

    "the length @xmath173 imposes an upper limit on the width of the reset state in position space , @xmath175 by the heisenberg uncertainty relation , this immediately yields a lower bound for the width @xmath176 of the reset state in momentum space , @xmath177 note that this is only a very rough estimate , without taking into account details of the actual wave packet .",
    "if the incident wave packet is very narrow in position space , then @xmath178 also may be much smaller than @xmath173 , and consequently @xmath179 may be much larger than @xmath180 .",
    "also , the reset state may be far from being a gaussian , and then already the first inequality in eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) may underestimate the width of @xmath179 seriously .",
    "let @xmath181 denote the width of the measured passage - time distribution .",
    "there are several contributions to this width .",
    "first , a particle with velocity @xmath172 takes the time @xmath182 to travel the distance @xmath183 between the two detectors , and therefore the width of the reset state in position space contributes @xmath184 to @xmath181 .",
    "second , the width in momentum space contributes according to @xmath185 third , the width of the delay , @xmath186 , for the first detection due to the spin - boson interaction is roughly @xmath187 an estimate for the width of the passage - time distribution is given by the sum of these contributions , where @xmath186 has to be counted twice since it arises in both detectors : @xmath188 from this estimate it is again seen that both small as well as large values of @xmath125 , i.e. , both slow as well as fast detectors , lead to rather broad passage - time distributions ( due to @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively ) .",
    "having established the general estimate for @xmath181 in eq.([delta_tau ] ) , we now turn to the task of finding optimal parameters , minimizing @xmath181 .",
    "we are interested in measuring the passage time through a spatial interval of length @xmath183 , the distance between the starting points of the two detectors , which we regard as fixed .",
    "first , we consider given detectors , i.e. , a given detection rate , @xmath125 .",
    "again , particles with mean velocity @xmath172 would be detected within an interval with length @xmath173 given approximately by @xmath191 .",
    "this means that the velocities must not be too large since in order to avoid undetected transmission @xmath173 must not exceed the actual length of the detector ( and in particular @xmath173 must not exceed @xmath183 ) .",
    "quantum effects , however , are expected to play a role for slow particles while fast particles may be treated classically , hence this is not a serious drawback .",
    "we assume that the reset state is a gaussian wave packet , or at least close to a gaussian , so that in the second line of eq.([delta_tau ] ) the approximate equality holds , @xmath192 we note that @xmath193 is a purely detector - related quantity , while the remaining contribution to @xmath181 is determined by the shape of the reset state only .",
    "we will first optimize this latter quantity . for given particles with given mean velocity , i.e. , @xmath194 and @xmath172 fixed",
    ", this is minimal for @xmath195 substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ delta_tau_gauss ] ) and writing @xmath196 for the kinetic energy of the incident particles yields @xmath197 the subscript `` @xmath198 '' indicates that only the reset state was optimized while the detection rate @xmath125 was considered as a given quantity .    aiming at optimizing also the detection rate @xmath125 for minimal @xmath199 , one would like to choose @xmath125 as large as possible in order to reduce the @xmath193 contribution to @xmath181 .",
    "however , one has to take into account that the width of the reset state is bounded by eq.([reset_x_bound ] ) .",
    "thus , given @xmath183 , @xmath194 , and @xmath172 , the decay rate must be at most of the order of @xmath200 with @xmath201 as in eq .",
    "( [ delta_x_opt ] ) .",
    "in fact , we may choose the incoming state such that it forms a gaussian minimal uncertainty packet at the starting point of the first detector with width in position space @xmath202 and choose further @xmath203 we note that , by this parameter choice , yet another requirement of a good measurement scheme is fulfilled : the detection by the first detector will not change the wave function too strongly .",
    "the reset operation after this detection is essentially a projection onto the detector region , and the detection is slow enough that at typical detection times most of the wave packet overlaps with the detector , hence the projection does not change the wave function too much .",
    "thus , the reset state will be close to a gaussian wave packet with width @xmath204 . substituting eq.([a_opt ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ delta_tau_opt_reset ] ) finally yields @xmath205    we stress that , independent of the detection rate @xmath125 , the optimal energy dependence of @xmath181 is limited to @xmath0 already by the dependence of @xmath181 on the width of the reset state in position space , @xmath206 [ eq .",
    "( [ delta_tau_x ] ) ] , and on its width in momentum space , @xmath207 [ see eq.([delta_tau_p ] ) ] .",
    "for the example of a cesium atom with @xmath208 and a distance of @xmath209 between the detectors ( with rectangular sensitivity function ) of the preceding section , optimal values would be according to eqs .",
    "( [ delta_x_opt ] ) and ( [ a_opt ] ) @xmath210 considering the wave packet with @xmath211 actually investigated in the examples , the optimal decay rate according to eq .",
    "( [ a_opt ] ) would be @xmath212 .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that the example with @xmath125 closest to @xmath213 yields the narrowest distribution .",
    "we have investigated the continuum limit of a fully quantum mechanical spin - boson model for the detection of a moving particle and its application to passage - time measurements .",
    "the continuum limit has been derived under the condition that the spin - boson interaction satisfies the markov property , an assumption that was explicitly verified in ref .",
    "analytical expressions for the state immediately after the first detection have been obtained , and for an example with a simplified detector model and 15 boson modes it was shown numerically that the continuum limit is in very good agreement with the discrete model .",
    "further , analytical expressions for the passage - time distribution have been obtained , and numerical examples for passage - time measurements have been discussed .",
    "detectors with a very slow response yield broad distributions , due to the poor quality of the individual measurements , and so do very fast detectors , due to the strong distortion of the particle s wave function by the measurement .",
    "intermediate detectors yield narrower distributions .",
    "the optimal precision of the present measurement scheme has been estimated to behave like @xmath0 , where @xmath170 is the kinetic energy of the incident particle . for slow particles",
    "this is better than , and in contrast to , a scheme based on quantum clocks which yields an @xmath1 behavior .",
