    "recently , a new class of commensurate - incommensurate ( c - i ) transition , magnetic - field induced c - i transition , which had been theoretically predicted,@xcite was experimentally established in an one - dimensional antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg spin system coupled to lattice degrees of freedom , the spin - peierls ( sp ) system ; the magnetic transition is observed in magnetization measurements @xcite and the incommensurate lattice modulation is visibly shown in x - ray diffraction experiments.@xcite the sp system shows a transition at @xmath7 from the uniform ( u ) spin-1/2 quantum liquid phase to the dimerized ( d ) phase , where spin - singlet ground state is formed at the expense of the lattice deformation energy.@xcite with the application of magnetic field , a new magnetic phase appears above a threshold field @xmath4 because the nonmagnetic spin - singlet state becomes energetically unfavorable in high magnetic fields .",
    "the magnetic moment is partly recovered in the chain , and spin solitons `` are formed in this magnetic phase .",
    "the spin soliton '' contains both lattice deformation and moment ( carrying spin 1/2 ) , whose spatial distribution is governed by the sine - gordon equation .",
    "usually , the periodicity of the solitons are determined simply by the applied magnetic field , and as a result , the spin and lattice modulation becomes incommensurate .",
    "therefore , this high - field phase is called incommensurate ( i ) phase .",
    "after the existence of the incommensurate modulation is established , the subsequent interest on this i phase is how the spin and lattice modulation evolves under higher magnetic fields ( well above @xmath4 ) , where the soliton distance becomes comparable to the soliton width",
    ". @xcite    the discovery of the inorganic sp compound cugeo@xmath3 ( ref .  ) opened the way to impurity substitiution and it turned out that just a small amount of the impurity modifies the phase diagram to a more complicated one ; @xcite with decreasing temperature , after the appearance of d phase at @xmath7 , the system shows another transition to a peculiar ordered phase , where antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range order and the sp order coexist [ dimerized af ( d - af ) phase].@xcite the staggered moment and the lattice deformation are spatially modulated in d - af phase ; the amplitude is larger near the impurity sites and smaller in between them.@xcite in contrast to such well - established pictures of the ordered phase in low fields ( d and d - af phase ) , the spin distribution in high - field phases of the impurity - doped systems is still under question .",
    "also , the phase boundaries for the high - field phases are not yet investigated for the system with its cu site substituted by impurities ( cu - o chains are directly disordered ) , although there exist several reports on these phase boundaries for the system whose ge site is substituted .",
    "recently , we reported that @xmath0 of cu@xmath1mg@xmath2geo@xmath3 is sensitive to the mg - doping ( disorder),@xcite and demonstrated that such transport measurement is useful in examining the disorder effects . in this work ,",
    "we have measured the thermal conductivity of cu@xmath1mg@xmath2geo@xmath3 single crystals with the application of magnetic field up to 16 t. the specific heat is also measured supplementally for the identical samples .",
    "first , @xmath0 of the pure cugeo@xmath3 is measured in order to identify the dominant scattering mechanism in the i phase .",
    "it turned out that the dominant heat carriers ( phonons ) are strongly scattered with the appearance of the spin solitons in the i phase , indicating that @xmath0 is a good probe of the soliton distribution .",
    "our main result is an anomalous plateau feature found in the @xmath5 profile in the antiferromagnetically ordered i ( i - af ) phase of the mg - doped samples , suggesting that the spin solitons are frozen in the i - af phase .",
    "the single crystals of cu@xmath1mg@xmath2geo@xmath3 were grown with a floating - zone method . we have prepared both pure cugeo@xmath3 ( the sp transition temperature @xmath7=14.5 k ) and two mg - doped samples @xmath8 and @xmath9 with @xmath7 s of 11.5  k and 9  k , respectively .",
    "( the @xmath7 s are determined by dc magnetization measurements ) .",
    "the mg concentration is carefully determined by inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectroscopy ( icp - aes ) .",
    "@xcite the mg - doped samples shows the nel transition at @xmath10  2.5  k and 3  k , respectively.@xcite masuda _",
    "carefully examined @xmath11 dependence of the @xmath6 for the same series of crystals and found that @xmath6 jumps at the impurity - driven transition from the d - af phase to the uniform af phase without dimerization .",
    "@xcite note that the d - af phase shows up below @xmath6 in the sample used for our present study because the mg concentration of the both samples is smaller than the critical concentration @xmath12 ( @xmath13).@xcite the thermal conductivity is measured using a one heater , two thermometers \" method .",
    "the direction of the heat current and the magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath14-axis , i.e. , the chain direction .",
    "the detailed experimental technique is described elsewhere.@xcite since the total thermal conductivity is expressed as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are specific heat and diffusivity of each heat carrier denoted by @xmath18 ( the diffusivity @xmath17 is proportional to the mean free path of the heat carrier ) , the specific heat measurement is helpful in the analysis of the @xmath0 data .",
    "we have measured the specific heat in magetic fields up to 16 t by the usual relaxation method for the same samples .",
    "the addenda consists of a sapphire substrate , a cernox temperature sensor ( calibrated in magnetic fields ) and 1-k@xmath19 micro heater .",
    "the connection from the addenda to the heat sink is made by sb - au thin wires to provide a moderate heat - relaxation rate , from which the heat capacity is calculated .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "1(a ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in fields up to 16 t. the transition temperatures from the u phase to the d phase ( below 9  t ) and to the i phase ( above 14 t ) are indicated as @xmath7 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "while both phonons and spin excitations carry a large amount of heat in the u phase , @xcite phonons become the dominant heat carrier at temperatures well below @xmath7 in the d phase because of the spin gap .",
    "these phonons are mostly scattered by defects at the lowest temperatures , where spin excitations are almost absent , and field dependence is small there ; the 0-t and 9-t curves merge below @xmath21  3  k. when thermally excited spin excitations increase with temperature and the scattering rate of the phonons are enhanced , via spin - phonon coupling , @xmath0 starts to decrease with temperature , producing a pronounced peak around @xmath21  5  k.@xcite since this peak in @xmath0 is a manifestation of the spin gap , the peak height is rapidly suppressed with magnetic fields.@xcite    the field dependence of @xmath0 at 4.2 k is presented in the main panel of fig .",
    "1(a ) to see the suppression of the peak under magnetic fields . a sudden drop in @xmath0 , accompanied by hysteresis , shows up at the first order transition from the d phase to the i phase ( @xmath22 t ) .",
    "when the magnetic field increases above @xmath4 , @xmath0 starts to increase at @xmath21 14 t. the specific heat @xmath23 is measured for the same sample in order to elucidate the origin of the field dependence of @xmath0 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the 14-t and 16-t data are plotted together with zero - field data in fig .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0 , @xmath23 in the i phase is _ larger _ than that in the d phase below @xmath25  10  k , indicating that the jump in @xmath0 at @xmath4 is caused by a sudden change in _",
    "diffusivity_. it is also to be noted that the values of @xmath23 at 14  t and at 16  t do not significantly differ below @xmath20 , while @xmath0 shows an apparent increase above 14  t , suggesting the enhancement in the diffusivity @xmath17 with the field application above @xmath26  t.      figure 2(a ) shows the @xmath5 profile of the @xmath8 sample at 5 k , which is above the zero - field @xmath6 ( @xmath27  k ) , determined from dc magnetization .",
    "similarly to the pure sample [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , @xmath0 is rapidly suppressed with magnetic field when the field approaches @xmath28  t , and then increases in the field range above @xmath4 .",
    "hysteresis is observed in the vicinity of @xmath4 also for this sample , although the transition becomes broader .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "the transition temperatures @xmath7 and @xmath20 are indicated with arrows ( together with @xmath6 ) .",
    "note that the 14-t and 16-t curves merge below @xmath6 , suggesting field independent @xmath5 above @xmath4 in this temperature range .",
    "since this feature is expected to be more pronounced for a sample with higher @xmath6 , we measured the field dependence of the @xmath9 sample .",
    "figure 3(a ) presents @xmath5 profiles at the temperatures of 2.5  k and 5  k. an apparent plateau is observed above @xmath28  t in the 2.5-k curve , while the 5-k curve shows a slight upturn above @xmath4 , similarly to the field profile in the i phase of the pure sample .",
    "figure 3(b ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in three different fields above @xmath4 and that without magnetic field .",
    "one can see that the 12- , 14- and 16-t curves merge below @xmath29  k , which is close to zero - field @xmath6 ( @xmath21  3  k ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the specific heat of the same @xmath9 sample .",
    "the 16-t curve shows a @xmath30-shaped anomaly , indicating that @xmath6 under this magnetic field is around 4  k , just below which the plateau feature appears in the @xmath5 profile .",
    "note that @xmath6 at 16  t is apparently higher than the zero - field @xmath6 , because the spin fluctuation is reduced by field application.@xcite it is also notable that a broad anomaly is observed above @xmath6 up to @xmath31  8.5  k , suggesting the existence of another phase at higher temperatures .",
    "first , let us consider the @xmath5 profile at 4.2  k shown in fig",
    "the dominant heat carriers are phonons in the pure cugeo@xmath3 well below @xmath7 , where the spin excitations are hardly excited because of the spin gap",
    ". therefore , @xmath5 shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) mostly reflects the field dependence of @xmath32 at least below @xmath4 .",
    "when the population of the spin excitations gradually increases with field , the scattering by the spin excitations increases and , as the result , @xmath32 slowly decreases .",
    "while the major part of the specific heat is due to phonons in the d phase , the additional component , i.e. , magnetic specific heat @xmath33 , appears in the i phase , as shown in fig .",
    "this result reproduces the report by lorenz _",
    "et al . _ , @xcite and is consistent with the theory claiming that @xmath33 is due to magnetoelastic excitations called phasons .",
    "@xcite since both @xmath33 and @xmath34 depends on temperature as @xmath35 , the total @xmath23 is @xmath35 .",
    "the thermal conductivity is given by @xmath15 ( @xmath36 ) , where the additional magnetic specific heat @xmath33 reaches twice as large as the phonon contribution @xmath34 [ see fig .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath0 suddenly _ decreases _ at the transition from the d phase to the i phase , meaning that the decrease in @xmath32 is dominant at the transition , though the newly appearing phasons could also carry some heat . since",
    "little change in @xmath34 is expected at @xmath4 , it must be @xmath37 that is responsible for the abrupt change in @xmath5 , indicating the sudden appearance of new scatterers of phonons in the i phase .",
    "it is most likely that phonons are strongly scattered by domain walls accompanied with the spin solitons , which would be equivalent to the scattering by the phasons .",
    "note that the ultra - sonic results , in which sudden change in elastic constants was shown at @xmath4 , are understood in terms of the phonon - soliton interaction .",
    "the @xmath5 profile above @xmath4 also is not simply explained by @xmath23 in the i phase ; @xmath0 increases above @xmath21  14  t , while the difference in @xmath33 at 14 t and that at 16 t is negligible within the accuracy of our measurement ( @xmath38% of @xmath33 ) , @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) . since the enhancement in @xmath0 from 14 t to 16",
    "t is more than four times larger than this maximum error , the diffusivity should be responsible for the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath0 also in the field range above @xmath4 .",
    "assuming that @xmath39 is governed by the scattering by the domain walls in the i phase , as is discussed above , @xmath39 should be modified when the soliton distribution changes with field . in a sufficiently high magnetic field where the soliton distance @xmath40 becomes comparable to the soliton width @xmath41 , the adjacent solitons would overlap with each other and the lattice and spin modulation might become sinusoidal wave , as is suggested by a recent nmr measurement @xcite and a magnetostriction result.@xcite it is expected that the cross section of the domain - wall scattering is smaller for the sinusoidal - wave modulation than for the independent solitons , because the amplitude of the lattice modulation is smaller for the sinusoidal - wave distribution .",
    "such field dependence of the soliton distribution well explains the enhancement in @xmath39 with field above @xmath4 , and is consistent with the @xmath5 profile in the i phase .",
    "the ratio of @xmath42 is @xmath43 at @xmath26  t ( ref .  ) where the overlapping becomes evident in @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath23 data demonstrate anomalies at the transition temperatures and at the critical field , we can discuss the phase boundary for the high - field phases of the mg - doped cugeo@xmath3 .",
    "so far , contradictory results are reported on the high - field incommensurate phases for cugeo@xmath3 crystals whose ge site is substituted by si .",
    "two transitions are observed in the specific heat measurement ; one is from the u phase to the incommensurate phase without af ordering ( i phase ) and the other is a nel transition from this i phase to the i - af phase.@xcite on the other hand , the result of a ultrasound - velocity measurement suggests a direct transition from the u phase to the i - af phase .",
    "@xcite    let us discuss this problem on the basis of our @xmath0 and @xmath23 data for the mg - doped samples , where cu - o chain is directly modulated .",
    "the nel transition to the i - af phase is apparent also for the mg - doped samples ; the specific heat shows a clear @xmath30-shaped peak ( fig .",
    "4 ) , and the field dependence of @xmath0 disappears as shown in fig .  2(b ) and fig .",
    "in addition to the features at the nel ordering , an enhancement is observed below @xmath44  k in @xmath0 for the @xmath8 sample [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] . the specific heat data for the @xmath9 sample in 16  t also shows an enhancement below @xmath45  k ( fig .",
    "the results indicate the existence of the i phase without af order for the mg - doped samples.@xcite however , the anomaly in the @xmath23 data is not so obvious at @xmath20 as at @xmath6 .",
    "this is probably because of the existence of short - range ordered ( sro ) state in the sp transition in the impurity - doped cugeo@xmath3 . noting that long - range sp order is not established down to @xmath21  6.5  k at 0  t for the @xmath9 sample ( ref .  ) , and assuming the sro state also in magnetic fields above @xmath4 , the transition temperature @xmath20 \" will not be well - defined .",
    "the field induced transition from d to i and from d - af to i - af phases at @xmath4 is also evident in the @xmath5 profile ; @xmath0 for the @xmath8 sample and the two curves for the @xmath9 sample ( at 2.5 k and 5 k ) rapidly decrease ( with hysteresis when @xmath8 ) with the application of magnetic fields below @xmath46  11.5  t , while the decrease abruptly disappears above @xmath4 [ fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .",
    "3(a ) ] , similarly to the d - i transition observed for the pure cugeo@xmath3 .",
    "note that the transition at 5  k ( above @xmath47  4  k ) and that at 2.5  k ( below @xmath6 ) take place at almost the same field around @xmath46  11.5  t , i.e. , the value of @xmath4 is irrelevant to whether the temperature is above or below @xmath6 .",
    "the above results suggest that both transitions , from d to i and from d - af to i - af , are commensurate - incommensurate \" transition , which is characterized by the appearance of the spin solitons . the suggested phase diagram is presented in fig .",
    "5 , following the discussion in this subsection .",
    "the most striking observation in the @xmath5 profile for the mg - doped samples is the plateau feature which appears in the i - af phase [ see fig .",
    "since the plateau suddenly appears above @xmath4 , it should be related to the specific scattering mechanism in the incommensurate phase , i.e. , the scattering by the domain - walls .",
    "therefore , the field independence in the i - af phase suggests that the soliton population and their distribution are _ not _ affected by the magnitude of the applied magnetic field , indicating that the solitons are frozen . since the plateau in @xmath5 is present only below @xmath6 [ see fig .",
    "3(b ) ] , it is the specific feature of the i - af phase , and the af order must be essential for the soliton freezing . in the i - af phase , it is suggested that solitons are preferably distributed around the impurity sites and that staggered moments are distributed also in between these solitons.@xcite since the spin - flop transition takes place at @xmath48  t , @xcite the staggered moments are directed almost perpendicular to @xmath49 in the i - af phase . when the magnetic field increases , there are two ways to gain the magnetic energy @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the additional magnetization : one is to append other solitons in between the impurity sites , though this position is not so favored compared to the impurity sites , and the other is to ca nt the staggered moments to the direction of @xmath49 .",
    "the second process can give an origin of the soliton freezing \" induced by the antiferromagnetism , because the soliton distribution is preserved under further magnetic field .",
    "although the above scenario gives a plausible explanation , independent measurements by neutron scattering and/or nmr are required to elucidate this microscopic mechanism of the antiferromagnetism - induced soliton freezing .    the dotted line in fig .",
    "3(b ) indicates that @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath52 when the sample is cooled below @xmath6 .",
    "since the specific heat have the temperature dependence of @xmath35 , the diffusivity should behave as @xmath53 , the typical temperature dependence of @xmath32 when phonons are scattered by dislocations of solids , like defects .",
    "the observation shows that the domain walls of the spin solitons behave as rigid dislocations , which would be consistent with the above picture of the frozen solitons in the i - af phase .",
    "the results of the thermal conductivity measurement on both pure and mg - doped cugeo@xmath3 , accompanied with the specific heat measurement for the same crystals , help to further understand the high - field incommensurate phase of the sp system , the spin - soliton phase .",
    "first , it turned out that the phonon transport in the i phase is governed by the domain - wall scattering due to the significant phonon - soliton interaction , and is strongly influenced by spatial distribution of the solitons .",
    "since the kink features in @xmath49 and @xmath54 dependence caused by the appearance ( change in the distribution ) of the solitons tell us the transition into ( in ) the i phase , the @xmath55 phase diagram of the mg - doped cugeo@xmath3 ( where the cuo chain is directly disturbed ) , is established .",
    "based on our result of @xmath5 above @xmath4 , it is suggested that the spin solitons are frozen in the i - af phase with the help of the af ordering , providing a clue for the full understanding of the spin distribution in this unusual coexistence phase .",

    "<S> in particular , the plateau feature in the doped samples suggests freezing \" of the solitons , in which antiferromagnetism must be playing an essential role because this feature is absent at temperatures above @xmath6 .    2 </S>"
