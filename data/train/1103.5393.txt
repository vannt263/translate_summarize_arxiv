    "the stellar rate of the carbon - nitrogen - oxygen ( cno ) cycle of hydrogen burning @xcite is controlled by the slowest process , the @xmath0n(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction @xcite . in the sun ,",
    "hydrogen burning proceeds mainly by the competing proton - proton chain , and the cno cycle contributes only 0.8% to the energy production @xcite .",
    "however , solar cno hydrogen burning gives rise to neutrino emission lines from the @xmath3 decay of @xmath4n and @xmath2o @xcite . it has recently been suggested @xcite to use the expected cno neutrino flux data from the borexino detector @xcite and the planned sno+ @xcite detector to measure the abundance of carbon and nitrogen in the solar core .",
    "this would address the so - called solar metallicity problem @xcite , which is given by the fact that the new solar metallicities @xcite lead to inconsistencies in the standard solar model .",
    "the correct interpretation of the expected cno neutrino data requires , however , that the nuclear reaction rate of the cno cycle , which is determined by the @xmath0n(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o cross section , be known with sufficient precision .",

    "subsequently , a number of new experimental and theoretical results on this reaction have been reported @xcite , showing that the recommended value of the reaction rate @xcite has to be revised downward by a factor of two . in particular , capture to the ground state in @xmath2o ( fig .  [",
    "fig : levels - o15 ] ) was shown to be strongly suppressed @xcite .",
    "this reduction is now adopted in a very recent compilation @xcite",

    "this discrepancy amounts to about 15% of the total extrapolated @xmath11 , dominating the uncertainty .",
    "the only significant methodical difference between the two fits from luna @xcite and tunl @xcite is the treatment of high - energy data .",
    "the luna fit is a global fit , based on the luna data presented in the same paper , and on the schrder _",
    "_ data @xcite which had been corrected for the summing - in effect .",
    "the tunl fit , on the other hand , is a partial fit based solely on the tunl data presented in the same paper , with the higher - energy r - matrix poles kept fixed based on a previous fit of the schrder _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "the starting values and general procedure for both fits are otherwise the same @xcite .",
    "the experimental data points by luna @xcite and tunl @xcite are generally in agreement with each other , but they show some systematic uncertainty due to the fact that both groups had employed large germanium detectors in close geometry . this arrangement had been chosen in order to obtain a high enough detection efficiency for the weak ground state capture line .",
    "however , in this way both groups also incurred true coincidence summing - in corrections of more than 100% for the ground state data .",

    "the experimental problem of the previous high summing - in correction is solved by using a clover detector .",
    "the problem of the selection of the database is solved by providing the ground state cross section relative to that for the well - known capture to the state at 6792kev .",
    "the present relative data can then be added to one particular data set without introducing additional scaling uncertainty .",
    "alternatively , they can be rescaled to absolute data using an overall fit of 6792kev capture based on several independent works , strongly reducing the scaling uncertainty .    for the present experiment , the energy range of @xmath7 = 317 - 353kev has been selected , far enough above the 259kev resonance to limit resonant contributions , and at the same time a region where a sensitive minimum @xcite of r - matrix fits is observed .",

    "because of their limited energy span , the present data alone can not form the basis of new extrapolations .",
    "however , they may serve as useful reference points in an energy range that may be accessible not only at luna , but also at future underground accelerators .    the new branching ratios for the decay of the 259kev resonance that are shown here improve the precision of the database for this resonance .",
    "since this resonance is often used as normalization point for experimental work on the @xmath0n(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o reaction ( * ? ? ?",

    "the present data are an important ingredient in updates of the standard solar model @xcite .",
    "when experimental data for the flux of solar cno neutrinos due to the @xmath55-decay of @xmath4n and @xmath2o become available from borexino @xcite or sno+ @xcite , precise @xmath0n(p,@xmath1)@xmath2o cross sections may contribute to a direct measurement of the solar metallicity through a comparison of cno and @xmath56b neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "possible next steps in improving the precision for the extrapolated s - factor of this reaction @xcite are to re - study the cross section at higher energies @xcite , in order to improve the extrapolation , and a remeasurement of the strength of the 259kev resonance ."
