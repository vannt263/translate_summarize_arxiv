    "birkhoff s theorem ( bt ) states that in general relativity ( gr ) any spherically symmetric solution of the einstein field equations in vacuum must be stationary and asymptotically flat . as a consequence",
    "the metric exterior to a spherically symmetric mass distribution must be a schwarzschild metric .",
    "one important corollary of the theorem is that the metric inside a spherical shell ( or inside the innermost of a sequence of concentric such sheels ) is the minkowski metric .",
    "birkhoff s theorem is the generalization from newtonian theory to gr of gauss law for gravity . as a consequence of gauss law , outside a spherically symmetric mass distribution",
    ", the newtonian gravitational field is that of a point mass at the center of the distribution .",
    "meanwhile , the gravitational field anywhere inside any spherical mass shell vanishes , in the context of the inverse - square - law of newtonian gravity , these results are easily understood .",
    "for example , at a point inside a spherical shell , the force on a test particle from any thin ring on the shell , is precisely balanced by the force due to a ring subtending the same angle but directly opposite the first ring . even if the test particle is not at the center .",
    "this is because the decrease in the gravitational force due to one ring being farther away from the test particle , is precisely balanced by the increase in area ( and so mass ) of that farther - away ring .",
    "one can think of birkhoff s theorem as describing the motion of a zero - mass test particle in the presence of a spherically symmetric mass distribution .",
    "a zero - mass test particle does not spoil the spherical symmetry .",
    "however , in realistic situations , the `` test particles '' probing a gravitational field have a finite mass .",
    "often , this mass is not small at all , as in the case of a large galaxy inside a cluster .",
    "therefore , unless the test particle is at the center of the distribution , its presence perturbs the system from spherical symmetry , spoiling the assumptions underlying bt .",
    "this paper addresses the impact this violation of spherical symmetry has both in gr and in theories that implement the ideas of modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) .",
    "mond @xcite , the reader will recall , is an alternative to dark matter in which the missing gravity problem of galaixes is solved by altering the gravitational force law , rather than by introducing new unseen forms of matter .    in both gr and mond , there are reasons to suspect that the force on a test particle inside a spherical mass shell may not actually vanish .",
    "general relativity is a metric theory .",
    "massive bodies change the geometry around them .",
    "a massive test particle distorts the space around it and thus a `` spherical shell '' ceases to be a spherical shell unless the test particle is at its center .",
    "this distortion effect from test particle will appear in any modification of gr that preserves its metric nature  such as dgp , teves @xcite , generalized einstein aether ( gea ) and f(r ) .    in the case of mond , which is not itself a metric theory ( although its covariant implementations , such as teves and gea are ) , the inverse - square law which is crucial for the vanishing acceleration of the test particle inside the shell ( or at least for our intuitive understanding of why it vanishes ) does not exist .",
    "mond was proposed to explain galactic rotation curves , and therefore is characterized by a gravitational field scaling as @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 at large distances from a bounded mass distribution . in what follows , we consider the mass distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ dist ]  a spherical shell of mass @xmath2 plus an interior off - center point mass , @xmath3 , of much lower mass .",
    "we may consider this distribution to be a very simplified version of for example a galaxy in a cluster , or a clump of matter ",
    "star , globular cluster , clump of dark matter  inside a galaxy .",
    "for definiteness we will the total mass of the system to be typical of a galaxy cluster , @xmath4 , and take the radius of the shell to be fixed at a typical cluster raius , @xmath5 . we now proceed to investigate the acceleration of the point mass in both general relativity and mond .",
    "in newtonian mechanics , a spherical shell is a well - defined object .",
    "however , in gr , since particles change the geometry around them , the simple definition of a sphere as a set of point equidistant from some common point ( the center ) is lost in the presence of a perturbing mass .",
    "we define a spherical shell using parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) coordinates .",
    "we identify a point , the center , such that the distance from the center in ppn coordinates is the same for each point on the shell .",
    "we call this distance @xmath6 the radius of the shell",

    ", we should remove from equation ( [ einstein ] ) the terms that are associated with the acceleration of the shell ( which is much smaller than the acceleration of the point particle ) .",

    "the gravitational acceleration clearly does not vanish  it points toward the center .",
    "a particle inside a spherical shell is therefore attracted toward the center to restore spherical symmetry , where the acceleration happily does vanish .",
    "however , since @xmath21 , the acceleration is very small compared to , say , the newtonian acceleration just outside the shell , @xmath22 .",
    "it is suppressed by both the ratio of the test mass to the shell mass , and , more importantly , by the ration of the schwarzschild radius @xmath23 of the shell to its physical radius .",
    "this suppression factor is huge for typcial astrophysical systems , @xmath24 for our choice of mass and radius .",
    "this suppression factor makes the acceleration physically insignificant in gr .",

    "we note that the first term , which is dominant over other terms , is independent of the specific choice of @xmath38 function .",
    "it is a consequence solely of the mond condition : @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) from which the field equation ( [ modpossion ] ) is derived is invariant under spacetime translations and spatial rotations .",
    "energy - momentum and angular momentum conservation therefore hold for an isolated system in mond .",
    "in particular , newton s third law of action and reaction is valid .",
    "hence , the acceleration @xmath69 of the point particle in the frame of the shell can be found from equation ( [ sforce ] ) .",

    "to find the acceleration of the point particle in a more general case , we adapt the numerical scheme developed by milgrom @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the field @xmath82 is defined by @xmath83 so long as @xmath38 is monotonic , one can invert the relation in equation ( [ ufunction ] ) and write @xmath84 in terms of u. for the specific choice of @xmath38 given by equation ( [ mufunction ] ) , @xmath85 the field @xmath86 , then , satisfies the set of differential equations @xmath87 the discretization and numerical calculation on the lattice is done in terms of @xmath86 . because of the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath84 and @xmath86 , one can find @xmath84 from @xmath86 .",

    "the code iterates to make the curl vanish at each vertex of the lattice . @xmath88 also serves as the boundary condition for the numerical solution . since @xmath90 , @xmath86 and @xmath88",
    "differ only by the curl field .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the curl field for a bounded mass distribution vanishes at least as fast as @xmath91 . then , assuming that the physical size of the lattice is large compared to the mass distribution , @xmath92 on the boundary .",
    "we implement milgrom s algorithm on a spherical lattice .",

    "[ comp2 ] shows how numerical values depend on the number of lattice points .",
    "as expected , the values approach the perturbative solution as l increases . in the following study , we use the lattice size of @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "[ mass ] is where @xmath106 . in this regime ,",

    "this implies that galaxies with slight mass differences might experience quite different acceleration in theoriest that implement the mond limit .",
    "the distance dependence of the acceleration is shown in fig .",
    "[ aposition ] .",
    "again , the acceleration of the particle vanishes when the particle is near the center ( @xmath107 ) , and increases monotonically outward .",
    "near the shell ( @xmath108 ) , the value for @xmath109 exceed that for @xmath110 .",
    "this is because the peak mentioned above occurs at lower value of @xmath105 for larger value of @xmath20 .",
    "unlike for gr , in mond the acceleration of the point particle is a significant fraction of @xmath76 .",
    "especially when the particle is close to the shell , the acceleration can be larger than @xmath76 .",
    "in both general relativity and mond , the acceleration of a massive test particle inside a spherical mass shell vanishes only when the particle is at the center of the shell . when the particle is displaced from the center , the particle experiences a force toward the center of the shell , the direction in which spherical symmetry would be restored .",
    "the magnitude of the acceleraion in gr is not physically significant in most ( or probably all ) astrophysical situations of interest , since it is suppressed by the ration of the schwarzschild radius of the shell to the size of the shell .    in mond , on the contrary",
    ", the acceleration of the point particle is a significant fraction of the surface gravity just outside the shell .",
    "this is despite the fact that mond has a birkhoff or gauss - like theorem which implies that the potential inside an isolated spherical mass shell is constant .",
    "however , this theorem operates in the absence of the usual explanation for gauss law in newtonian gravity or classical electrostatics  the balance between the @xmath111 growth of surface areas and the @xmath1 force law .",
    "thus , when the very particular conditions of birkhoff s theorem are broken even a little , the graviational force re - emerges at considerable strength .",
    "the characteristic mond field for the values of parameters used in this paper is approximately @xmath112 . from fig .",
    "[ mass ] and fig .",
    "[ aposition ] , we can see that the acceleration inside the spherical shell can be significant at this scale .    in mond ,",
    "the applicability of birkhoff s theorem is very limited , and in computations one needs to consider not only the local mass distribution but also the background mass distribution .",
