    "classification of the gapped electronic states from the viewpoint of quantum topology has shed a new light on our understanding of the physical properties of solids .",
    "topological insulators and superconductors are the two major ingredients of this classification @xcite . the topological periodic table has been proposed based on the time - reversal , particle - hole , and chiral symmetries , which are the three fundamental and robust symmetries of the hamiltonian even without the translational symmetries or point - group symmetries @xcite .",
    "10 classes are identified in this table , and the homotopy group is allocated to each class depending on the spatial dimensionality of the system . this mathematical classification alone , however , does not provide the physical properties of the concrete systems , nor provide the way how to construct the topological indices linked to the zero - energy bound states at the boundary of the sample .",
    "therefore , the studies of explicit models are needed to explore the rich physics hidden in the periodic table .",
    "one interesting question is how the two different physical phenomena , characterized by each topological index , are related within the same symmetry class . to examine this question in the simplest model , we analyze in this paper the dimerized kitaev model , which belongs to the bdi class and is a hybrid system comprised of the spinless su - schrieffer - heeger model of polyacetylene @xcite and the kitaev model of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath0-wave topological superconductor @xcite .",
    "the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model , i.e. , dimerized one - dimensional chain , is a model proposed for polyacetylene . at the edges of the sample or at the kink of the dimerization pattern , i.e. , soliton , the zero - energy in - gap bound states appear due to the topological reason . on the other hand ,",
    "the kitaev model is the one - dimensional spinless @xmath0-wave topological superconductor , where superconducting pairing occurs between the nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the finite chain of the kitaev model supports majorana fermions at edges .",
    "the kitaev model is realized by using a 1d nanowire with strong rashba spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "several experiments about the nanowire systems have so far been reported @xcite .",
    "both models have the particle - hole symmetry . however , their origins are different . in the case of the ssh model ,",
    "the sublattice symmetry between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sublattices gives the particle - hole symmetry , while the superconductivity is the source in the kitaev model .",
    "correspondingly , we can define the two kinds of topological indices , @xmath3 and @xmath4 in eqs .",

    "@xmath3 is induced by the sublattice symmetry and equals the number of zero - energy states , while @xmath4 is induced by the particle - hole symmetry due to the superconductor and equals the number of majorana zero - energy states . by these two indices ,",
    "the phase diagram is determined , and their relation to the zero - energy states at the edges and the associated transport properties are revealed .",
    "we also investigate the zero - energy states in the presence of a dimerization soliton in our hybrid model .",
    "as is expected , a zero - energy fermionic state appears in the ssh - like region , which is eventually suppressed by the @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "remarkably , we find a peak of the local density of states ( ldos ) at zero energy splits into two peaks which shift toward the edges by the effect of the @xmath0-wave pairing .",
