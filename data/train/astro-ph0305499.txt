    "starburst galaxies emit hard x - rays as wells as soft x - rays from the hot gas due to starburst phenomena ( e.g. pietsch et al . 2000 , bregman , schulman , & tomisaka 1995 ) . the hard x - rays can be represented by thermal emission with @xmath9 @xmath10 a few kev ( e.g. awaki et al .",
    "1996 , tsuru et al . 1997 ) .",
    "although the @xmath11 observations did not have the capability to investigate the hard x - rays in detail , the @xmath1 x - ray observatory , with its superior spatial resolution , has now resolved the hard x - ray emission into many discrete sources ( e.g. griffiths et al .",
    "2000 for m82 and weaver et al .",
    "2001 for ngc 253 ) .",
    "recent @xmath1 observations suggest the existence of a relationship between star formation and these discrete sources , especially ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( e.g. fabbiano , zezas , & murray 2001 ; lira et al .",
    "the relationship is crucial to study the evolution of starburst galaxies .",
    "thus , we have to know the nature of discrete sources in detail .",
    "ngc 1569 is one of the closest dwarf starburst galaxy at a distance of 2.2 mpc with similar metallicity to that of the magellanic clouds ( israel 1988 ) .",
    "the size of this galaxy is 1.6 @xmath2 1.1 kpc . since this galaxy is thought to have entered a starburst phase 1020 myr ago ( e.g. israel & de bruyn 1988 ) , it is suitable for the investigation of the relationship between starburst phase and the x - ray populations .",
    "the asca observation revealed that ngc 1569 possesses a hard x - ray component with @xmath12 3.7 kev similar to other starburst galaxies ( della ceca et al .",
    "the hard component was spatially resolved into point sources by the @xmath1 observation ( martin , kobulnicky , & heckman 2002 ) : in order to properly classify these sources , we have searched for short timescale variability of the hard x - ray sources in ngc 1569 . here ,",
    "we present our results and discuss their implication for the x - ray sources in ngc 1569 .",
    "ngc 1569 was observed with the @xmath1 x - ray observatory on 2000 april 11 .",
    "the galaxy was placed on the acis - s3 chip .",
    "the data were screened , and were available in the archive under sequence number of 600085 .",
    "the total exposure time with all known corrections was @xmath097 ks .",
    "we analyzed the data of bright x - ray sources in the central region of ngc 1569 using ciao 2.2.1 .",
    "an x - ray image in the 0.510 kev band of the ngc 1569 central region was produced , and then the image was smoothed using the adaptive smoothing algorithm in csmooth .",
    "the smoothing scale was adjusted to achieve a minimum s / n of 2 and a maximum s / n of 5 .",
    "the image of the central region of ngc 1569 is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the image size is a 31.@xmath134 square , which corresponds to a 335 pc square at ngc 1569 .",
    "four bright sources , ( cxou 043048.1 + 645050 , cxou 043048.2 + 645046 , cxou 043048.6 + 645058 , and cxou 043049.8 + 645055 ) , with s / n @xmath10 5 , are clearly detected .",
    "we extracted light curves of all four sources with a bin size of 2000 s ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the data were accumulated within 4@xmath13 diameter circles centered on the sources . within this diameter ,",
    "the encircled energy is greater than 90% .",
    "we found that the x - ray flux of cxou 043048.1 + 645050 increased by @xmath010 times in only 2 @xmath2 10@xmath3 s , and that cxou 043048.6 + 645058 showed rapid variability with a time scale of 2000 s , and a flare - like event towards the end of the observation in fig .",
    "2 . in order to examine these time variabilities",
    ", we made a corresponding light curve of a nearby background region ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the count rate of the background was scaled by the size of the source region for comparison with the source count rate .",
    "the averaged background count rate was only 4 @xmath2 10@xmath14 c s@xmath7 , which was much smaller than the source count rates .",
    "we divided the observation into two , and then extracted spectra of the two variable sources in order to investigate whether any spectral changes accompany the time variability .",
    "the first half of the observation ( with an accumulation time of @xmath048 ks ) corresponds to a weak phase for both of the sources .",
    "the surface brightness of the diffuse x - ray emission from the galaxy is very low ( fig .",
    "1 ) . therefore a background spectrum ( shown in fig .",
    "2 ) was extracted from the data within the nearby blank - field region displayed in fig.1 to subtract the diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "we note that the background was high at the start of the observation as pointed out by martin , kobulnicky , & heckman ( 2002 ) .",
    "however , we included these events in our analysis , because the background count rate was still much smaller than the source count rate .",
    "3 shows spectra of cxou 043048.1 + 645050 and cxou 043048.6 + 645058 from the first half and in the latter half of the observation .",
    "the spectra were fitted separately with a single power - law model . in the fitting ,",
    "the column density was fixed at galactic column density of @xmath15 = 2.1 @xmath2 10@xmath16 @xmath17 ( burton 1985 ) , when the best - fit column was smaller than the galactic value .",
    "the observed x - ray fluxes and absorbed luminosities are estimated using the best - fit values ( table 1 ) .",
    "in the galaxy ngc 1569 , four bright hard x - ray sources are detected with @xmath1 .",
    "two of them show short - timescale variability .",
    "their mean luminosities are of order 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath7 in the 0.510 kev band , and their spectra are well fitted with a single power - law model .",
    "cxou 043048.1 + 645050 has no optical counterpart , and was considered to be an x - ray binary by martin , kobulnicky , & heckman ( 2002 ) from its spectral energy density .",
    "its x - ray flux dramatically increased in only 2 @xmath2 10@xmath3 s. this short timescale variability suggests that this source is actually associated with an x - ray binary , although it has a steep spectrum with @xmath18 4.1 .",
    "the mean , absorbed luminosity in the latter half of the @xmath1 observation was 5.3 @xmath2 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath7 in the 0.510 kev band ( table 1 ) . in its bright phase , which occurred 8 @xmath2 10@xmath3 s after the begining of the observation ( in fig .",
    "2 ) , the absorbed 0.510 kev luminosity was @xmath01 @xmath2 10@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 , which translates to an unabsorbed luminosity of 5.4 @xmath2 10@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "this is larger than the eddington limit for a 1.4 @xmath19 neutron star , @xmath20 = 2 @xmath2 10@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 ( supper et al . 1997 ) .",
    "most of high mass x - ray binaries have flat x - ray spectra with a photon index of @xmath01 ( e.g. yokogawa et al .",
    "2000 ) and most of low mass x - ray binaries ( hereafter lmxbs ) have an age of more than 100 myr ( e.g. white & ghosh 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , this source seems likely to be a stellar black hole rather than a neutron star binary .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with a disk blackbody model , and then obtained the best - fit values of @xmath21 = 0.43@xmath220.05 kev and @xmath15 = ( 2.1@xmath220.4 ) @xmath2 10@xmath16 @xmath17 , where @xmath23 is the temperature at the innermost disk boundary ( table 2 ) .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the disk blackbody component ( @xmath24 ) in the bright phase was estimated to be 1 @xmath2 10@xmath6(cos @xmath25)@xmath7 ergs s@xmath7 , where @xmath25 is the inclination angle of the disk ( makishima et al .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 suggest that the source is a possible candidate of a stellar black hole with @xmath020(cos @xmath25)@xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the spectrum in the first half was also fitted with a disk blackbody model with @xmath28 kev and @xmath5 1.3 @xmath2 10@xmath8(cos @xmath25)@xmath7 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "these values can be explained by a smaller mass - accretion onto the stellar black hole .",
    "the large values of @xmath29 in tables 1 and 2 are mostly due to absorption - like features at about 1.2 kev and 1.6 kev .",
    "these features exist before background subtraction and so are not caused by problems with the background spectra .",
    "adding absorption lines at 1.2 kev and 1.6 kev to the power law and disk blackbody models improves the reduced @xmath29 values in tables 1 and 2 to 1.1 and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "future observations to confirm whether these absorption features are intrinsic or not are very important .",
    "cxou 043048.6 + 645058 is associated with a star cluster ( hunter et al .",
    "the age of the star cluster is considered to be @xmath30 30 myr , based on the optical color of the cluster .",
    "cxou 043048.6 + 645058 showed variability on the order of a thousand seconds , and also showed an interesting flare - like feature .",
    "however , its spectrum did not change significantly during the @xmath1 observation .",
    "the unabsorbed luminosities in the 0.510 kev band were 3.6 @xmath2 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath7 and 7 @xmath2 10@xmath8 ergs s@xmath7 in the first and latter half of the observation , respectively .",
    "although the x - ray spectrum and the x - ray luminosity are similar to those of neutron star binaries , the presented evidence does not allow to distinguish between the two possibilities of a neutron star binary and a black - hole binary .",
    "we found that several weak sources also showed time variability .",
    "4 shows the x - ray images during the first half and the latter half of the observation .",
    "sources # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 are seen in the first half , but are not seen in the latter half .",
    "their count rates during the first half were ( 2@xmath221 ) @xmath2 10@xmath14 c s@xmath7 , ( 2@xmath221 ) @xmath2 10@xmath14 c s@xmath7 , and ( 7@xmath222 ) @xmath2 10@xmath14 c s@xmath7 , which correspond to the x - ray luminosities in the range of ( 14 ) @xmath2 10@xmath31 ergs s@xmath7 , and those during the latter half were @xmath30 1 @xmath2 10@xmath14 c s@xmath7 , @xmath30 1 @xmath2 10@xmath14 c s@xmath7 , ( 2@xmath221 ) @xmath2 10@xmath14 c s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "these errors are given for 68% confidence .",
    "the time variabilities suggest that these sources are x - ray binaries .",
    "since many lmxbs are formed after few gyr from the start of starburst phase , most of those detected sources would be high mass x - ray binaries rather than lmxbs .",
    "in fact , the similar irregular galaxy , smc contains many high mass x - ray binaries ( yokogawa et al .",
    "we have discovered rapid variability from two bright x - ray point sources in ngc 1569 with @xmath1 .",
    "the x - ray flux of cxou 043048.1 + 645050 increased within 2 @xmath2 10@xmath3 s. during its bright phase , the spectrum was fitted with a disk blackbody model with @xmath4 0.43 kev and the bolometric luminosity is @xmath010@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "based on its properties , we suggest that this object may be a stellar black hole binary rather than a neutron star binary .",
    "cxou 043048.6 + 645058 also showed short time variability along with a flare - like event .",
    "its spectrum did not significantly change during this time . considering the x - ray characteristics of this source",
    ", it may be a neutron star binary , although we can not rule out a possibility of a stellar black hole binary .",
    "we also found that three weak x - ray sources showed possible time variability .",
    "this large number of variable sources may suggest an abundant population of x - ray binaries in ngc 1569 . using a large x - ray observatory , such as @xmath32-@xmath33 and @xmath34",
    ", we can will be able to detect the time variability of fainter objects , and may detect x - ray pulsations of x - ray binaries in ngc 1569 .",

    "we also thank an anonymous referee for comments and suggestions that greatly improved the paper .",
