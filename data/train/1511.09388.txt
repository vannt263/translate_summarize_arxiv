    "note that , in addition , it is also possible to _ shift _ the _ position _ of dirac points in momentum space by inducing anisotropic tunneling rates along different lattice directions , e.g. , by an anisotropic intensity distribution in the three lattice laser beams as in ref.@xcite .",

    "after the crossed dipole trap ( xdt , dashed green line ) is switched off the quantization axis is rotated back to its initial orientation during the time - of - flight ( tof ) before a stern - gerlach gradient field ( sg ) is applied for @xmath76 that separates the spin components . ]    in the superfluid regime , the atomic ensemble occupies the lowest bloch band of the lattice at zero quasimomentum @xmath77 . in the following , we use the notation @xmath78 for the @xmath79-th bloch wave function at zero quasimomentum in the hyperfine state @xmath80 . from the initial state in the zeroth bloch band @xmath81 transitions",
    "can be driven to other bloch bands @xmath82 .",
    "the microwave spectroscopy can be treated as a two - level problem such that transitions are described as a rabi oscillation between the initial state @xmath81 and the final state @xmath82 .",
    "the ratio of transferred atoms is then given by @xmath83 where the frequency detuning @xmath84 is determined by the microwave frequency @xmath85 and the frequency difference @xmath86 between the initial and the final hyperfine state in its respective bloch band .",

    "an example for a microwave transition from the initial @xmath90 state into the @xmath91 state for @xmath92 is shown in fig.[fig:10 ] . here ,",
    "the involved spin components are separated during time - of - flight by a stern - gerlach gradient field and detected by resonant absorption imaging [ see fig . ] .",
    "the resulting transition spectra , depicted in fig . , exhibit clear resonance features , whereby a clear shift of the transition frequency can be observed in the spin - dependent honeycomb lattice .",

    "( b ) microwave spectra for the transition obtained in the 1d and the 3d - lattice . while the transition in the state - independent 1d - lattice is exactly at the same position as for the free dipole trap ( zero position of the microwave frequency difference ) the transition in the state - dependent potential",
    "is clearly shifted towards larger frequencies .",
    "error bars indicate the standard deviation of the data that were averaged at least twice .",
    "solid lines depict fits to the spectra according to eq.([eq6sinc ] ) for the 1d - lattice ( black ) and a double gaussian for the 3d - lattice case ( blue ) . ]    in fig.[fig:05 ] two different scenarios are investigated with respect to the orientation of the quantization axis .",
    "the microwave spectra presented in fig .",
    "are obtained for an initial state with magnetic quantum number @xmath93 that is independent of any circular polarization of the lattice light field while the final state with @xmath94 is strongly influenced by the rotation of the quantization field .",
    "hereby , the honeycomb lattice depth amounts to @xmath95 and the additionally confining 1d - lattice depth is @xmath96 .",
    "in contrast , the spectra shown in fig .",
    "are obtained for the opposite case of a state - independent final hyperfine state and a state - dependent initial state .",
    "while the honeycomb lattice depth is also set to @xmath95 , the 1d - lattice potential of @xmath97 significantly increases on - site interaction effects .     to @xmath53",
    "is shown for a honeycomb lattice depth of @xmath95 and an additional 1d - lattice of @xmath96 .",
    "a shift of the transition between lowest bloch state towards smaller frequencies can clearly be observed for increasing energy offset between the final two - fold atomic basis .",
    "in addition , a second transition into the first excited bloch state appears for a strong energy difference ( see red arrows in the inset ) .",
    "( b ) a transition from @xmath39 to @xmath98 is shown for the same honeycomb lattice depth but a strong 1d - lattice of @xmath97 .",
    "again , a transition to the first excited bloch state emerges for increasing energy offset while a residual transition to the lowest bloch state remains .",
    "solid lines in ( a ) and ( b ) are gaussian fits to the data . ]    for @xmath56 , the quantization axis is aligned exactly in the lattice plane and the twofold atomic basis of the honeycomb lattice is completely degenerate .",
    "both spectroscopy signals are thus identical . indicated by the respective insets ,",
    "both the initial and final state have an effective magnetic quantum number @xmath57 . here",
    ", a single resonance is observed that corresponds to a transition into the lowest bloch function of the final state .",
    "the transition into the second bloch state is not observed as the franck - condon overlap between the initial and final wave functions vanishes : both final and initial state are eigenstates of the isotropic honeycomb potential and , thus , orthonormal .",
    "this circumstance , however , significantly changes for an effective magnetic quantum number different from zero .",
    "let us first consider the transition @xmath99 in fig .. if the quantization axis is rotated out of the lattice plane the resonance position for the transition between lowest bands first gets shifted towards smaller frequencies as evident for the case of @xmath100 . this behavior can be understood as the final bloch state @xmath101 becomes more deeply trapped at the now stronger confining sublattice site .",
    "hence , the energy difference between initial and final state decreases due to the light shift . for larger energy offsets between the twofold atomic basis the resonance",
    "is shifted further towards smaller frequencies as observed in the spectra for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "in addition , a second resonance appears that indicates a transition into the second bloch state .",
    "this transition emerges since the initial and final potentials now strongly differ such that the respective bloch functions of initial and final state are no longer orthonormal . here , the change from an asymmetric triangular state to a symmetric honeycomb state is evident as the energy offset between the sublattice sites decreases .    .",
    "as expected the franck - condon overlap for the transitions to the second bloch state vanishes for both cases in the symmetric honeycomb lattice at @xmath104 where initial and final states are similar .",
    "( b ) _ ab initio _ calculations of the resonance positions reproduce the extracted values ( circles and triangles ) .",
    "while interaction effects are omitted for the calculations of the @xmath99 transition , the @xmath105 transition is investigated by the iterative gross - pitaevskii method described in the text .",
    "dashed lines indicate the calculated resonance positions neglecting interaction effects for the transition @xmath105 . ]",
    "the corresponding microwave spectra of the investigated @xmath105 transition are shown in fig .. a similar emergence of a transition to the second bloch state can be observed for an increasing energy offset .",
    "moreover , this resonance shifts towards higher transition frequencies as now the energetically lower _ initial _ state of the @xmath106 hyperfine manifold rather than the final state becomes increasingly confined such that the transitions are further separated . strikingly , a similar shift of the transition to the first bloch state is not reproduced .",
    "while the resonance position remains relatively constant for an increasing energy offset , it quickly becomes broader and vanishes .",
    "in contrast to the previously discussed @xmath99 transition such a behavior can not be understood in a simple single - particle picture .    in fig.[fig:06 ] the calculated franck - condon factors and the resonance positions of the first two bloch states are shown for the transitions @xmath99 and @xmath105 . in the non - interaction limit",
    "the theory predicts that the absolute values of both transition frequencies and franck - condon coincide ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the finite spread of the calculated wave function overlap and the resonance positions indicate an assumed uncertainty of the calibrated lattice depths by @xmath107 .",
    "our experimental results for the @xmath105 transition are in strong contradiction to this prediction .",
    "indeed , for the @xmath105 transition , with a potential depth of @xmath97 , the additional confining 1d - lattice was chosen to be significantly stronger as compared to the @xmath99 transition ( @xmath108 ) . in addition , the initial state is confined to a single lattice site for quantization axis angles different from @xmath49 .",
    "this inhomogeneous density distribution strongly influences the final state , which experiences an effective potential deformed by the repulsive interparticle interactions . to gain a deeper understanding of the strength of this effect ,",
    "the eigenfunction of @xmath98 is numerically evaluated by solving coupled gross - pitevskii equations including the additional interaction shift . for the calculations , homogeneous average filling of @xmath109 to @xmath110 particles per lattice site",
    "was estimated while the calibrated lattice depths were assumed to be exact .",
    "this initial occupation number strongly affects the influence of the effective interaction potential giving rise to the areas of uncertainty in the depicted calculations . in comparison to calculations neglecting interaction effects ( dashed lines ) ,",
    "the obtained values for the frank - condon overlaps show a significant increase of the transition to the second band .",
    "moreover , the observed shift of resonance frequencies for an increasing site - offset is confirmed by the iterative mean - field method in stark contrast to the non - interacting case .",
    "the observed resonance positions from the microwave spectra in fig.[fig:05 ] , indicated by circles ( triangles ) for the transition to the first ( second ) bloch state are in good agreement with the _ ab initio _ calculations .    in conclusion ,",
    "the agreement of the investigated microwave spectra with the expected behavior of atomic ensembles in the state - dependent honeycomb lattice verifies the experimental technique of continuously tuning the band structure by altering the potential in real - space .",
    "moreover , strong influences of interaction effects could be reproduced by means of an additional effective mean - field potential .",
    "while the interest in multi - orbital systems of ultracold atoms has increased tremendously in recent years , mechanisms responsible for inter - band relaxation remain elusive and such decay processes still lack a deeper understanding .",
    "in contrast to solid state systems where a variety of mechanisms may induce band decay processes ( e.g. , charge carrier multiplication or exchange of energy with spin degrees of freedom ) inter - band dynamics of ultracold atoms is driven by collisional processes @xcite .",
    "for example , heinze _ et al . _",
    "@xcite report a striking influence of the scattering length on the lifetime of a particle - like excitation in the second energy band of single - component fermi gas .",
    "in the following , we aim to investigate decay mechanisms of bosonic atoms in excited bands of the tunable honeycomb lattice with respect to the presence of dirac cones . by utilizing the possibility to continuously alter both the real - space lattice potential and , thus ,",
    "the energy band structure the gap at the dirac cones can be opened and closed in a controlled manner .",

    "to the @xmath39 state ( see inset ) exhibits three distinct resonances that can be attributed to the four lowest energy bands .",
    "band mapping images ( c ) reveal the characteristic shape and population of the corresponding brillouin zone ( b ) , where the third and fourth band are simultaneously populated since they are degenerate at the @xmath111 point [ compare fig.[fig:02 ] ] .",

    ", a microwave spectrum of the transition from the @xmath112 state into the @xmath39 state is shown for a quantization field aligned along the @xmath23-axis ( @xmath113 )",
    ". it is obtained at lattice depths of @xmath114 and @xmath115 . by applying a band mapping procedure , information of the momentum - resolved band population can be obtained . here",
    ", transitions to different bloch bands can be identified [ compare fig . and ] .",
    "the resonance with the highest frequency is the transition to the lowest bloch band where the corresponding band mapping image clearly reproduces the hexagonal shape of the first brillouin zone .",
    "while this transition is relatively weak due to the small spatial overlap between the wave functions that are primarily confined to different lattice sites ( see inset ) , the transition to the second bloch state is strongly pronounced . here ,",
    "the band mapping image shows the characteristic hexagram of the second brillouin zone . for smaller transition frequencies , a broad transition into both the third and the fourth energy band can be observed .",
    "these transitions occur simultaneously as they are degenerate at zero quasimomentum .",
    "again , the band mapping clearly shows the population of the respective brillouin zones .",
    "note that , in contrast to the spectroscopy signal itself , the shown images were obtained by a _ sweep _ of the microwave frequency over the resonance ( indicated by gray shaded areas ) . with this , an optimal transfer into the given state can be achieved . the solid line in fig .",
    "shows a theoretical calculation of the transition spectrum . despite the relatively small lattice depths ,",
    "mean - field interaction effects have been taken into account , whereby the initial on - site occupation number has been weighted according to the in - trap thomas - fermi density profile . in order to reproduce the shape of the transition , sinc - profiles determined by eq.([eq6sinc ] ) have been summed for all four lowest transitions at every evaluated frequency . with the absolute height of the transition being the only free parameter in the numerical calculations the obtained",
    "signal is in excellent agreement with the experimental data .",
    "results shown in fig.[fig:07 ] demonstrate that sweeping the microwave pulse frequency through a transition to a final bloch state is a suitable technique to transfer an atomic ensemble with high efficiency into excited bloch bands of an optical lattice . in the following ,",
    "we employ this method in order to investigate the dynamical behavior of atoms excited to the second bloch band with respect to the presence of dirac cones between the two lowest bands that can be adjusted by the rotation of the quantization axis .    in fig .",

    "the difference of the decay timescales between the two scenarios is emphasized as time - of - flight images for the same initial state with opened and closed bands are shown . while in the case of a broken inversion symmetry ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath113 and @xmath118 the first brillouin zone is populated by a majority of atoms after waiting times larger than @xmath119 , this occurs already after approximately @xmath120 for the case of closed dirac points .",

    "for the same reason , the validity of observations corresponding to a final state of @xmath98 ( gray markers ) is limited : the band gap can not be opened in this case .    for bosonic atoms in higher bands of optical lattices ,",
    "the decay mechanisms are driven by the interactions .",
    "two collisional channels have been identified so far .",
    "a collision of atoms in the first excited bloch band can result in both atoms decaying into the lowest energy band @xcite or one atom being excited into a higher band while the other atom decays into the lowest band @xcite , whereby both processes clearly are only allowed if energy and momentum can be conserved . in the former case the excess energy of the band gap",

    "however , the presence of this decay mechanism is contradicted by the observations shown in fig.[fig:08 ] : no increase of higher - band populations could be observed for any measurement series and the combined atom number in the first and second brillouin zone remains constant for the measurements of the @xmath39 as depicted in fig ..    here , the described models of band decay in optical lattices fail to explain our observations . however , as an important aspect , the additional influence of the external trapping potential has to be taken into account as it induces a momentum oscillation of the atoms in the excited band .",
    "for an oscillation through the minimal band gap atoms can , thus , undergo a landau - zener - stckelberg transition into the lowest band .",
    "yet , simulations of such transitions with the harmonic trapping frequencies present in the system yield timescales of such decay processes that are at least an order of magnitude larger as the observed lifetimes .",
    "we therefore tend to exclude this scenario as an explanation for the striking difference in the observed lifetimes of atoms in the excited band for opened and closed dirac cones .",
    "in conclusion , we have successfully demonstrated a novel approach to continuously alter both the real - space lattice potential as well as the energy band structure of a state - dependent _ artificial graphene _ lattice .",
    "moreover , by breaking the inversion symmetry of the lattice , an energy gap at the dirac points can be opened and adjusted continuously . as this experimental technique solely relies on a change of the orientation of the systems quantization field it opens up new possibilities in both the static as well as the dynamic engineering of state - dependent optical potentials in a clean and easily controllable way .    in proof - of - principle experiments ,",

    "the resulting spectra are in good agreement with numerical calculations of transition frequencies .",
    "furthermore , interaction effects could be described by means of an effective potential in the mean - field regime .",
    "extensive _ ab initio _ simulations of a microwave spectrum over a large frequency range yield an excellent agreement with the obtained data by including the in - trap density distribution of atoms .",
    "the study of decay mechanisms from the first excited bloch band revealed a striking influence of the lifetime in the excited band with respect to the presence of dirac points .",
    "however , further systematic investigations are necessary in order to solve open questions regarding the identification of decay mechanisms .    beyond the discussed experiments , the newly implemented technique offers many other possible applications .",
    "for example , the ability to quickly rotate the quantization axis could allow for excitation schemes similar to ref.@xcite and @xcite , where the sudden change of the anisotropy of sublattices enabled the coherent population of higher bloch bands . moreover , the behavior of mixtures of different hyperfine states in a honeycomb lattice can be influenced profoundly by its state - dependency .",
    "for example , repulsive interactions between a mixture of two hyperfine states that are trapped at different basis sites leads to a strong _ tunneling blockade _ in both triangular sublattices @xcite .",
    "in addition , such binary spin mixtures can give rise to a new quantum phase in the superfluid regime .",
    "it is characterized by a phase twist of the complex superfluid order parameter and results in a symmetry breaking in momentum space @xcite .    in a combination with time - reversal symmetry breaking induced by periodic lattice driving as presented in @xcite the inversion symmetry breaking due to the rotation of the quantization axis",
    "could be utilized to investigate topological phase transitions in the framework of the haldane model @xcite or to engineer non - abelian gauge fields @xcite . moreover , the rotation itself can also be utilized for periodic driving schemes in analogy to the spatial translation discussed in the previous chapters . here , a modulation of the sublattice energy offset may give rise to exotic dynamics in quantum spin - mixtures .",
