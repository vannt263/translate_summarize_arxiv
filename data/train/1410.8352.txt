    "we calculated all three masses for each system by inverting ( by means of interpolation ) @xmath35 where @xmath3 is the mass of the companion star and @xmath36 is the orbital inclination .",
    "the minimum mass is calculated by retrieving the companion mass required for the case where @xmath26 , the median mass by calculating the companion mass required for the case where @xmath24 and the maximum mass ( @xmath37per cent probability limit ) with @xmath27 .",

    "[ he - wd ] that the @xmath3@xmath4 relation for msps with he wd companions is close to the rb region but rbs often lie to the right of it .",
    "to see statistically whether the rbs are consistent with having formed in a similar way to the msps with he wd companions , we use the method described by @xcite to predict the inclinations of the rb systems given the period  companion mass relation and the individual measured binary mass functions for the rbs ( calculated from their minimum companion masses ) .",
    "we expect these inclinations to be randomly oriented in space if the rbs are consistent with being formed by the rejuvenation mechanism .",

    "s test shows it is rather unlikely the rbs were formed in the same way as the he wd systems .",
    "@xcite studied the formation of both rbs and bws .",
    "they explored the route to these systems from lmxb progenitors with the mesa stellar evolution code @xcite .",
    "they found that a factor which determines whether the system evolves to a bw or a rb is the efficiency of the ablation process .",
    "they controlled this by an efficiency parameter @xmath30 and they computed the evolution of binary systems that initially consisted of a @xmath29 ns and a @xmath39 main - sequence donor in an orbital period of @xmath40d .",
    "the roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) begins with the companion still on the ms and continues until the donor star becomes fully convective at @xmath41 , corresponding to @xmath42 .",
    "at this point they turn off magnetic braking . interrupting magnetic braking",
    "causes the binary star to temporarily detach ( cease rlof ) .",
    "when it detaches the donor is out of thermal equilibrium and inflated following its rapid mass loss episode . during the detached phase it shrinks back into thermal equilibrium .",
    "angular momentum loss by gravitational radiation continues and drives the stars to shorter orbital periods until rlof resumes .",
    "the lack of rlof for a small range of periods accounts for the period gap in cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "the top of the gap is when the star detaches and the bottom is when the system reconnects . in the calculations made by @xcite ablation",
    "turns on when the system detaches at the top of the period gap and thereafter the evolution is governed by the interplay between ablation and orbital angular momentum loss by the emission of gravitational radiation : ablation increases the period while emission of gravitational radiation decreases it .",
    "@xcite propose that the variation in @xmath30 may be related to the orientation of the magnetic axis with respect to the spin axis so geometric effects are responsible for the two distinct regions that are occupied in the @xmath3@xmath4 plane by rbs and bws .",
    "they note that the rb systems at relatively large companion mass and large orbital periods are not reached by their tracks .",
    "@xcite completed a study of the evolution of close binary systems with a radio pulsar member .",
    "they considered the scenario in which the systems begin with a ns and a ms donor star in a phase of rlof .",
    "they computed the effect of x - ray irradiation feedback on the mass transfer .",
    "they argued that the x - radiation from accretion onto the ns could lead to rlof occurring in cyclic episodes .",
    "there are times when the mass transfer is weak and the pulsar turns on its radio emission mechanism ablating the companion .",
    "they conclude that bws descend from rbs but not all rbs become bws .",
    "a supernova is not necessary for there to be a pulsar in the system .",
    "the production of msps by aic was suggested by @xcite and extensively investigated by @xcite .",
    "we propose that rbs and some bws can be formed by accretion induced collapse of an onemg wd as a direct result of accretion , without a time lag between the cessation of the mass transfer and the aic event .",
    "if a cool , slowly rotating stellar core composed of oxygen , neon and magnesium ( onemg ) reaches @xmath43 then electron captures lead to its collapse .",
    "there is a loss of pressure support in the star triggered by the sudden capture of electrons by neon and magnesium nuclei .",
    "when a stellar envelope remains it is ejected in an electron capture supernova ( ec sn ) .",
    "an onemg wd that accretes sufficient matter from its companion can similarly collapse .",
    "this is accretion induced collapse ( aic ) . in single stars",
    "the zero - age main - sequence mass range that produces onemg cores that go through the necessary evolutionary steps to lead to a ec sn is very narrow , only about @xmath44 wide @xcite .",
    "only four per cent of single stars die in this way . in single stars",
    "the ec sn occurs when the star is on the super asymptotic giant branch ( sagb , @xcite ) . in the most massive agb stars ,",
    "core carbon - burning ignites gently before the envelope is lost .",
    "duplicity increases the range over which an ec sn can occur because mass transfer can prematurely remove the stellar envelope .",
    "it has been suggested that stars in close binaries systems with masses in the range @xmath45 to @xmath46 are likely to collapse in an ec sn , whereas single stars in the same mass range would end there evolution as onemg wds @xcite . because they lose their hydrogen - rich envelopes via mass transfer before entering the agb phase they bypass the second dredge - up of elements from their core leaving them with a larger helium core than their single star counterparts .",
    "initially our systems comprise two stars in a relatively wide detached binary system , the primary with mass between @xmath45 to @xmath46 and its companion with a mass of about @xmath39 ( refer to fig .",
    "[ aic ] , stage 1 ) .",
    "this binary system must be wide enough to allow the core of the primary star to grow an onemg core at its centre .",
    "this becomes the wd which later collapses to become a msp .",
    "the primary star evolves to overfill its roche lobe in such a way that a period of common envelope ( ce ) evolution commences ( fig .",
    "[ aic ] , stage 2 ) . in this epoch",
    "the secondary star and the core of the primary star spiral in towards each other whilst engulfed in the envelope of the primary .",
    "the envelope is ejected and the two stars emerge in a now much tighter binary system .",
    "the secondary star then evolves to overflow its roche lobe and starts to transfer matter to its now wd companion , formerly the hot core of the primary star left after the ejection of its envelope .",
    "the mass ratio of the companions is such that the rlof is stable ( fig .",
    "[ aic ] , stage 3 ) .",
    "the wd accretes matter from the secondary star until it reaches @xmath47 . in the aic the newly formed ns conserves",
    "the spin of its progenitor wd but loses some of its gravitational mass to general relativistic binding energy .",
    "this mass loss is thought to be around @xmath48 but it depends on the equation of state of the neutron star @xcite .",
    "it terminates the rlof because the system widens as the period adjusts to accommodate its new ns inhabitant .",
    "owing to the detachment , the pulsar can now turn on as a radio source and be observed as a msp . in this phase",
    "the system has the characteristics of a rb system ( fig .",
    "[ aic ] , stage 4 ) . without any additional mass loss ,",
    "the orbit of the system in this phase is constantly shortened by the drainage of orbital angular momentum by the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "the orbit would eventually shrink and force another phase of stable rlof .",
    "such a system would continue to accrete as an x - ray binary .",
    "the ns would grow and spin up , leaving the companion further depleted .",
    "however radiation from the pulsar can ablate its companion . in this case",
    "the orbit grows as the mass of the companion falls because the orbital angular momentum lost from the system is sufficient to avoid further rlof .",
    "there are some properties of aic events that make them attractive for the production of msps .",
    "when a typical onemg wd implodes to form a ns , the conservation of magnetic flux dictates that the final ns should have @xmath49 which is typical of the magnetic flux of msps .",
    "conservation of angular momentum leads to the ns spinning at millisecond periods .",
    "the kick of the aic is thought to be small @xcite so a system in which one star undergoes an aic has a good chance to remain bound and to have a low spatial velocity .",
    "thus we predict that rbs should have low spatial velocities .",
    "there are a couple of rbs listed in the atnf pulsar catalogue with measured proper motions that are consistent with this prediction , but there is not enough data to make a conclusive statistical statement .",
    "note that within the aic scenario we bypass the need to bury the magnetic field of a normal pulsar during rlof .",
    "all measured rb systems have almost circular orbits @xcite . during an aic of a onemg wd in a binary system ,",
    "an orbital eccentricity is induced . in the cases we present in this work the instantaneous expulsion of gravitational mass forces the once circular systems to have about @xmath50 .",
    "this eccentricity is rather short - lived because tidal interaction between the companion star and the newly formed ns quickly circularizes the orbit .",
    "the circularization timescale for the binary systems after the aic is about @xmath51 which is very short compared to the lifetime of our rbs ( about @xmath52 ) .",

    "the spectrum of the companion does point towards the conclusion that it is a he wd but is has a surface gravity of @xmath131 which is lower than a typical he wd , a lower effective temperature of @xmath132k and a larger radius than expected . for its period",
    "it has a larger mass than is predicted by the @xmath3@xmath4 relation for msps with he wd companions .",
    "considering the possibility that j1816 + 4510 formed in the same way as the canonical msp and he wd detached pair , the lower surface gravity and temperature , along with a larger radius could be consistent with ablation of the companion by the msp .",
    "this process would move the star to lower masses for a given period .",
    "however , this would take a system initially on the @xmath3@xmath4 relation for msps with he wd companions to the left of it rather than to the right .",
    "in our aic scenario we can make a model that passes through the data point of j1816 + 4510 in the @xmath3@xmath4 plane with a mass consistent with observations .",
    "it requires near conservative mass transfer to be possible .",
    "we begin with an initial wd mass of @xmath73 with a @xmath39 donor in an orbital period of @xmath133d .",
    "the wd grows efficiently to @xmath78 then undergoes the aic losing @xmath81 to become a @xmath25 ns .",
    "ablation then turns on with efficiency @xmath134 but this is not strong enough to keep the system detached so there is another phase of rlof .",
    "this rlof is conservative and the ns grows and spins up until it reaches the period gap , where it detaches as a @xmath135 ns .",
    "ablation turns on again at the same rate of @xmath134 .",
    "this decreases the companion mass and the orbital period .",
    "this model s track across the @xmath3@xmath4 plane is the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ ablate ] . not only is this method of obtaining the j1816 + 4510 system rather finely tuned but the companion does not display all of the same physical properties at the point where the model and the data point coincide . in our model",
    "the surface temperature of the companion to j1816 + 4510 is five times lower than that measured .",
    "however the companion in our model is consistent with almost filling its roche lobe and has a surface gravity of @xmath136 .    to get a he wd in the redback phase",
    ", the companion must have evolved off the ms : it must begin rlof between core hydrogen exhaustion and core helium ignition .",
    "in addition the companion must have lost practically all of its envelope in rlof to reveal its he core in order for the system to be observed as a msp with a he wd companion .",
    "a possible solution to the puzzle of j1816 + 4510 s formation is that the ns was born with a very high mass after an iron - core collapse supernova . in this scenario",
    "the pulsar would still need to be spun up by rlof to millisecond periods via the standard rejuvenation method @xcite .",
    "we have shown how redbacks can be produced if there is a phase of companion detachment in a close binary in which one component is a rapidly spinning neutron star .",
    "such detachment from roche lobe overflow interrupts accretion on to the neutron star so that the pulsar s radio emission mechanism can turn on and ablate the companion .",
    "we considered two causes of detachment , 1 ) directly after an accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of a onemg wd and 2 ) detachment of an accreting neutron star ( formed via aic ) and its companion at the equivalent of the cv period gap when the companion star becomes fully convective .",
    "we can split these two causes of detachment into high ablation cases and low ablation case respectively .",
    "we explored our aic scenario by allowing the wd to accrete up to a mass of @xmath78 ( from an original mass of @xmath73 ) , when it instantaneously loses @xmath81 of matter to simulate the loss of gravitational mass to internal binding energy of the neutron star .",
    "this abrupt mass loss widens the orbit and so terminates the roche lobe overflow .",
    "thereafter the interplay between ablation and magnetic braking dominates the evolution of the system .",
    "orbital angular momentum loss , owing to the emission of gravitational waves , operates in such systems but it is orbit shrinkage associated with magnetic braking that dominates . in our aic scenario we see that ablation efficiency governs whether the system remains detached to become a redback or shrinks back to an x - ray binary . for systems with higher ablation rates , of efficiency parameter @xmath101 , we found that the ablation rate is strong enough to keep the systems detached after an aic .",
    "lower ablation rates , @xmath102 , are not strong enough so such systems enter a second phase of roche lobe overflow , now with an neutron star accretor .",
    "when @xmath103 the ablation rate is strong enough after detachment at the top of the period gap to maintain a rb state and for @xmath104 the ablation rate is not strong enough and systems reconnect for a third phase of roche lobe overflow .",
    "these systems with very low @xmath30 could evolve to become black widows .",
    "a system only appears as redback when ablation dominates the evolution of the system . by varying the ablation efficiency we can produce models that can populate the redback region in @xmath3@xmath4 space while keeping all roche lobe overflow wholly conservative .    to investigate the effect that nova eruptions have on redback production we allow for a fraction @xmath137 of mass accreted by a white dwarf to be expelled with the specific angular momentum of the white dwarf in its orbit . for an initial binary system with a @xmath39 donor , a @xmath73 accretor and @xmath74",
    ", we find that varying @xmath105 from 0.2  to  1 , whilst maintaining an ablation efficiency of @xmath109 , thoroughly populates the redback region in the @xmath3@xmath4 plane .",
    "the lower @xmath105 the more mass is lost from the system in nova eruptions . for larger @xmath105",
    "we obtain models that reach the higher companion masses and larger periods that are thus far unexplained in literature @xcite .",
    "we have compared our models to a list of 17 known redback systems selected from both the atnf pulsar catalogue and those recorded by @xcite .",
    "we used the minimum mass of each system to obtain its binary mass function and this to calculate the maximum , median and minimum masses for the systems with a neutron star of @xmath25 which is consist with observed aic remnant masses and projected aic mass loss from a rigidly rotating white dwarf .",
    "we also investigated the possibility that rapidly rotating white dwarfs avoid aic until somewhat higher masses .",
    "these collapse to form more massive neutron stars .",
    "the resulting binary msps occupy a similar region in @xmath3@xmath4 space so that a range of neutron star masses from @xmath25 to as much as @xmath130 could exist in rbs within this scenario .    combining the systems that become redbacks straight after aic with those that become redbacks at the top of the period gap ( after an aic in previous evolution )",
    "we conclude that the aic scenario comprehensively covers the entire rb region of the @xmath3@xmath4 plane .",
    "we note that the system , j1816 + 4510 , that has a measured neutron star mass of @xmath121 fits in our aic in many respects but has an observed temperature far higher than the temperatures we are getting in models .",
