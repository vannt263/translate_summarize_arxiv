    "this regime is shown in fig .",
    "[ ncmean_xi0_6]-b for @xmath94 .",
    "this is a clear example where the collective behaviour of the active suspension depends not only on its degree of activity , but also on the type of hydrodynamic stresses squirmers induce in the surrounding fluid . as we decrease @xmath40 , the range of @xmath0 for which coarsening is observed increases asymmetrically between pushers and pullers .",
    "figure [ ncmean ] summarizes all results obtained for abp and squirmers . in both cases ,",
    "cluster formation is due to the competition between attraction and self - propulsion , as quantified by @xmath40 .    figure  [ ncmean]-a displays the mean cluster - size as a function of time for self - propelled brownian particles in two dimensions at different interaction strength .",
    "when attraction is stronger than propulsion ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 , dark blue curves ) , we observe the system coarsening and that the stronger the attraction the faster the coarsening .",
    "whereas when attraction competes with propulsion ( @xmath106 ) the system quickly enters a regime of steady state clusters , whose size depends on the propulsion strength ( the higher the propulsion , the smaller the clusters ) .    in figure [ ncmean]-b , we observe that the mean cluster size for @xmath107 is sensitive to the nature of the active hydrodynamics interactions , and changes with @xmath0 : pushers ( @xmath108 ) reach a steady state faster and the larger the @xmath109 the lower the mean cluster size ; whereas pullers , @xmath110 , coarsen .",
    "pullers with @xmath111 first reach a metastable mean cluster size of about 15 particles at short times , and their mean cluster size grows again due to cluster - cluster interactions : the smaller the @xmath0 the longer the time a suspension remains in its metastable state .    to ensure the robustness of either the cluster of the coarsening state , we have carried out simulations over longer times and simulations whose initial configuration consisted of all particles forming one big cluster : we observed that while at the beginning the mean cluster size dropped to the metastable state , then grew in the same way as when particles were randomly distributed at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "cluster formation is caused by attraction competing with self - propulsion .",
    "however , for squirmers active stresses modulate this competition . as a result",
    ", we observe that pullers promote cluster formation because of their tendency to align to nearby squirmers .",
    "therefore , for a given @xmath40 , a larger fraction of pullers coarsen compared to pushers of analogous active stress . for an equivalent @xmath40 , clusters of active brownian are on average larger than squirmers one , indicating that active stresses contribute to break clusters due to an induced hydrodynamic dispersion .",
    "however , we can not exclude that by fine tuning @xmath0 there may be ranges of @xmath40 for which the same mean cluster size can be obtained both for abp and squirmers .",
    "as shown in figure  [ ncmean]-c - f , when we further increase the activity beyond @xmath112 we enter a regime where all suspensions reach a steady state in which squirmers do not merge in one cluster , and the mean cluster size decreases as @xmath40 increases .",

    "abp with the same @xmath40 develop a mean cluster size similar to the pushers with a slightly negative value of @xmath0 ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the stress activity dictates the magnitude of the average cluster size , since pullers form larger clusters than pushers .",

    "the average cluster size is now smaller than for @xmath113 .",
    "for weak pullers ( @xmath115 ) the system exhibits a transient arrest : this behaviour could be attributed to the development of metastable clusters , before reaching the stable distribution for longer times .",
    "moreover , these puller suspensions exhibit stronger density fluctuations ( as we will discuss later ) which could underlining this peculiar behaviour .",

    "we observe that when @xmath115 and @xmath40 beyond @xmath116 @xmath118 oscillates at long times ( beyond the meta - stable state ) , and identify this feature as a third scenario where the mean cluster size of the suspension has an oscillatory behaviour , associated with a specific parameters range ( for @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) . to validate the persistence of the fluctuations",
    ", we run these simulations for longer time and conclude that 1 ) the attraction strength only affects the relaxation time towards this oscillatory regime , 2 ) the larger the value of @xmath40 the smaller the relaxation time . therefore , while the stress generated by the squirmers promotes both alignment and clustering between them , favouring oscillations of the mean cluster size , the attractive interaction partially competes delaying the relaxation to the regime controlled by active stresses .    in figure [ photos ]",

    "[ photos]-d ) .",
    "even though coarsening disappears increasing @xmath40 both for squirmers and for abp , particles are not distributed in the same way ( as shown in figures [ photos]-b and [ photos]-e and f ) and squirmer clusters are smaller , on average , than their brownian counterparts .",

    "in this paper we have carried out a systematic study of semi - dilute suspensions of interactive squirmers restricted to swim in a plane surrounded by an unconfined fluid .",
    "we have seen that active hydrodynamic stresses give rise to a steady state characterized by dynamic clusters .",

    "this fact already shows that the collective behaviour of an active suspension is not only a function of its degree of activity , quantified by @xmath40 , but rather on the details of the hydrodynamic coupling .",

    "we have analysed the collective behavior over time scales large compared to these intrinsic oscillations .",

    "increases significantly the cutoff distance for the csds .",
    "we have further compared the properties of the cluster phase of squirmers with the one generated by active brownian disks . in the latter case",
    "there are no stresses due to the surrounding fluid , and the only relevant parameter is @xmath40 , the effective pclet number .",
    "we have found that when attraction competes with activity , abp form larger clusters than squirmers at equivalent @xmath40 and the properties of the cluster phase resemble those of weak pushers .",
    "however , when activity dominates the csds are similar to the csds of pushers with the same interaction strength .",
    "the radius of gyration of the observed clusters also identifies the impact of active stresses .",
    "we have found that the exponent of the dependence of the radius of gyration on cluster size corresponds to clusters that are always more compact than dla and move from dlca to rlca as active stresses change from pushers to pullers .",
    "attractive forces lead to more compact clusters , but do not change qualitatively the trend promoted by active stresses .",
    "when attractive interactions compete with activity we find that clusters shrink as @xmath0 grows , while when activity dominates a contraction - expansion effect occurs for pullers .",
    "squirmers form generically polarized clusters , but the degree of ordering decreases with cluster size , showing again a strong difference between pullers and pushers.the polar order of the clusters is reduced when hydrodynamic interactions are present in the case where attraction competes with the activity , thus abp clusters are more aligned .",
    "this characteristic effect however is not observed once the activity dominates the attractive interactions .",
    "therefore , we have shown that hydrodynamics alone can sustain a cluster phase of active swimmers ( pullers ) , while abp form cluster phases due to the competition between activity and self propulsion .",
    "the structural properties of the cluster phases of squirmers and abp are similar , although squirmers show sensitivity to active stresses .",

    "@xmath9 is equivalent to the strength of a quadrupole for a symmetric arrangement of electric dipoles , when the dipole moments vanish .",
    "then , taking into account that we have only two non - zero terms , the boundary conditions on the surface of the squirmers depicted in equations ( [ slip_veloc ] ) can be written as @xmath232        to start with , we compute the radial distribution function of the lennard - jones fluid at the @xmath71 studied in the manuscript ( only considering configurations in the time interval when the system is in steady state ) . from figure 9",
    "we already observe that the system with pullers is more ordered than the system with pushers . in order to detect the clusters in the suspension , we use the first minimum ( @xmath234 ) of the radial distribution function and identify particles within this distance as neighbours belonging to the same cluster .    even though the @xmath235 depends on the hydrodynamic feature and the interaction strength , in figure [ gr ]",
    "we show that a value of @xmath236 is compatible with all chosen values of @xmath40 and @xmath0 .",
    "whereas the @xmath235s for abp have their first minimum at @xmath237 , this difference between squirmers and abp come from the fact that squirmers needs a soft repulsive potential for short distance ( @xmath238 ) in order to avoid overlapping among them .     for three different values of @xmath239 .",
    "the color code of the curves is as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath235s for abp are plotted in red .",
    "black line represents the chosen value of @xmath240 for squirmers , while pink line is @xmath234 for abp . ]    one important remark about the radial distribution function around @xmath234 is that it is quite flat , being the first and second coordination shell not too close to each other .",
    "therefore , choosing any value within this minimum is not going to affect the cluster size .    in figure",
    "[ fs_cutoff ] , we show the cluster - size distribution functions for different values of @xmath0 at @xmath113 , using three different values of @xmath241 .",
    "as expected , the csds follow the same power law with an exponential tail behaviour for the three values of @xmath234 , even though they move to larger clusters for larger values of @xmath234 for pushers ( that are less ordered , as shown in figure [ gr ] ) .              in figure  [ f_s_bp0_5 ]",
    "we represent the cluster - size distribution for different values of @xmath40 and @xmath0 evaluated at the same @xmath247 for two different system sizes , @xmath248 with filled symbols and @xmath249 with empty symbols .     for values of @xmath239 .",
    "in all panels , solid symbols are for small systems with @xmath248 whereas solid symbols are for big systems with @xmath249.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   for values of @xmath239 . in all panels ,",

    "however , when @xmath117 the results obtained for the small and large system only coincide for small clusters and deviate for larger ones .",
    "this is due to the fact that at @xmath117 cluster formation is originated by hydrodynamics ( long range ) interactions , thus affected by the system size .",
    "we now evaluate the clusters radius of gyration for two different system sizes . in figure  [ rg_bp05 ]",
