    "the images were deconvolved using the maximum likelihood method @xcite .",
    "like all deconvolution methods , knowledge of the point - spread function ( psf ) of an unresolved source is needed at each wavelength .",
    "the delivered psf can change due to different wind loads on the secondary mirror and differences in the telescope flexure as a function of telescope position . to mitigate these effects on ground - based telescopes ,",
    "high s / n observations of mid - infrared bright stars are usually taken immediately before and/or after each science target observation and as close to the science target as possible ( @xmath35 away ) so as to get the best psf calibration for use in the deconvolution procedure .",
    "however , in our case , finding a psf star that is bright enough at wavelengths out to 40 @xmath21 m that fulfills these requirements is nearly impossible and thus was not attempted .",
    "standard star images taken throughout our flight similarly did not have sufficient s / n for use as a psf calibrator at the longer wavelengths .",
    "therefore , we used these standard stars observations to determine an average fwhm for each wavelength for the flight .",
    "then artificially generated psfs ( using an airy pattern calculated from the wavelength , telescope diameter , and central obscuration diameter ) were constructed and convolved with a gaussian to achieve psfs with fwhms that equaled the measured average fwhms of the standard stars .",
    "these idealized psfs were then used in the deconvolution procedure .",
    "these deconvolved images compare favorably to simple unsharp masking of the original images , and hence all of the substructures revealed in the deconvolved images are believed to be real with high confidence .",

    "this work finds that the total luminosity is slightly lower than previous estimates .",
    "note this model can not account for the excess emission at @xmath47 m .",
    "one explanation for this emission is clumpiness in the dust cloud , or a cavity opening , which allows short wavelength radiation from warm dust to leak through holes in the cloud .",
    "we model radiation from the warmer interior of the shell as a single - temperature ( 425 k ) blackbody component .",
    "the plausibility of this model is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : w3ohsed ] , whereby an excellent fit to the data is achieved with a temperature consistent with that of the interior of the dust shell .",
    "there may also be a scattered light component at these wavelengths , but we do not model such a component since its geometry is relatively unconstrained .    an alternate explanation for the excess at @xmath48 m is a relatively high abundance of very small grains compared with large grains . in order to fit the data at @xmath48 m , we would need to consider a model with a modified mrn grain size distribution ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "however , in the ionized region , small grains can become super - heated and destroyed .",
    "the emission would come from a relatively high abundance of small grains in the infalling shell ; such grains would need to be primordial . given the jets that are seen in molecular emission , it is most likely that the excess short wavelength radiation originates in a cavity opening .",
    "the prediction one can make from this explanation is the presence of continuum emission in the amporphous silicate absorption band at 9.7 @xmath21 m , which decreases the depth of the absorption feature .",
    "mid - ir spectroscopy in the @xmath50 m window could be used to test this prediction .      in the radio continuum , the hot core w3(h@xmath4o )",
    "consists of 3 clumps designated as a , b , and c @xcite .",
    "an early claim to a detection of w3(h@xmath4o ) in the infrared came from @xcite who presented ground - based observations at @xmath51 m showing emission at the location of w3(h@xmath4o ) c , which lies approximately @xmath52 east of w3(oh ) .",
    "no emission was seen from sources a and b , which lie approximately @xmath53 east of w3(oh ) .",
    "however , this observation was not substantiated by @xcite who did not detect any emission from these sources at @xmath54 m , despite their spatially resolving w3(oh ) . in the forcast data , the separation of the peaks in the double - peaked line profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : line_plots ] ) yields the separation between w3(h@xmath4o ) and w3(oh ) , which we find to be @xmath55 at 37.1 @xmath21 m and @xmath56 at 31.4 @xmath21 m .",

    "<S> we model the dust component as a spherical shell containing an inner cavity with radius @xmath0 au , irradiated by a central star of type o9 and temperature @xmath1 k. the total luminosity of this system is @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> an observed excess of @xmath3 m emission in the sed can be explained by our viewing a cavity opening or clumpiness in the shell structure whereby radiation from the warm interior of the shell can escape . </S>",

    "<S> _ observations of four young stellar and protostellar objects in the sofia field , presumably associated with the w3 molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> results from the model sed fitting tool of @xcite suggest that two objects ( 2mass j02270352 + 6152357 and 2mass j02270824 + 6152281 ) are intermediate - luminosity ( @xmath7 ) protostars ; one object ( 2mass j02270887 + 6152344 ) is either a high - mass protostar with luminosity @xmath8 l@xmath9 or a less massive young star with a substantial circumstellar disk but depleted envelope ; and one object ( 2mass j02270743 + 6152281 ) is an intermediate - luminosity ( @xmath10 ) protostar nearing the end of its envelope accretion phase or a young star surrounded by a circumstellar disk with no appreciable circumstellar envelope . </S>"
