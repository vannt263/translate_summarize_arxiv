    "these problems with equation  ( [ eq : rmdm ] ) can be resolved as follows .",
    "first , instead of using the dm of the entire cosmic web to calculate the magnetic field strength , the dm only due to the whim should be used .",
    "this can be achieved by replacing @xmath105 with @xmath106 in equation  ( [ eq : rmdm ] ) , where @xmath3 is the value for t57 .",

    "figure [ f4 ] shows @xmath3 and @xmath4 for t57 as a function of dm for all in our cosmology model .",
    "this demonstrates that for the observed dms of frbs ( @xmath84  @xmath10 ) , errors for the evaluations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for t57 should be @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the redshift of an frb does not need to be known for estimating the igmf in filaments of galaxies using equation  ( [ eq : bf ] ) , provided that any local dm and rm contributions associated with the frb s host galaxy or immediate environment are also accounted for .",

    "our work suggests that if enough dms and rms of frbs can be determined , the strength of the igmf in galaxy filaments could then be estimated .",

    "first , we have used dm as an indicator of the redshift of an frb .",
    "although dm is a tight function of redshift , there is a variance .",
    "the variance introduces an uncertainty in deriving the the redshift from the observed dm , at an estimated level @xmath83 at a 1@xmath82 level . the uncertainty in redshift propagates into the evaluations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the whim .",
    "the uncertainties in the evaluations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are estimated to be @xmath109 .",
    "overall , the uncertainty in @xmath104 should be at most a few to several @xmath114 .",
    "in future , if host galaxies of frbs are identified and their redshifts are determined by follow - up observations such as line measurements , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the whim can be directly evaluated from the redshift instead of from the dm , reducing the uncertainties in the field strength estimate .",
    "there of course are other , possibly larger , uncertainties that we have not accounted for here .",
    "recent studies have noted that the dm contributions of frb host galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and of the foreground milky way and local supercluster ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could all be significant .",
    "likewise , the rm contributed by the frb s immediate environment , host galaxies , intervening galaxies along the los and the milky way could all be larger than the rm due to the whim ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the above additional contributions could be partly incorporated through further modeling , statistical approaches and faraday synthesis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , this will inevitably introduce additional uncertainties in @xmath104 .",
    "the number of frbs needed to reliably estimate the igmf in galaxy filaments would depend on such unknown foreground and host contributions as well as the cosmic variance .",
    "the estimation of the number is thus beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "further work using numerical simulations is needed to establish how many frb detections and how wide a survey area are needed to overcome involved uncertainties .    finally , it is interesting to apply our results to the observed data .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , very recently , the linearly polarized frb  110523 with dm @xmath115 @xmath10 and rm @xmath116 @xmath15 was found by @xcite .",
    "the observed amplitude of rm is too large to ascribe to magnetic fields in filaments .",
    "the authors suggest that the rm of the frb could be due to magnetic fields in the vicinity of the source itself or within the host galaxy ( see also fig .",
    "14 of * ? ? ?",
    "but it could be also contributed by magnetic fields in intervening and/or host galaxy clusters .",
    "although our equation  ( [ eq : bf ] ) was presented for the whim ( t57 ) , it can be also applied to the hot gas in clusters ( t79 ) .",
    "if we apply equation  ( [ eq : bf ] ) to the observed values of rm and dm for frb  110523 , along with @xmath117 and @xmath4 for t79 , we obtain @xmath118  @xmath23 g , which is somewhat strong , but possible for magnetic fields in clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we examine the proposal that the dispersion measures ( dms ) and faraday rotation measures ( rms ) of extragalactic linearly - polarized fast radio bursts ( frbs ) can be used to probe the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) in filaments of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the dm through the cosmic web is dominated by contributions from the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) in filaments and from the gas in voids . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> rm is induced mostly by the hot medium in galaxy clusters , and only a fraction of it is produced in the whim . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if one excludes frbs whose sightlines pass through galaxy clusters , the line - of - sight strength of the igmf in filaments , @xmath0 , is approximately @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a known constant . here , the redshift of the frb is not required to be known ; @xmath3 is the fraction of total dm due the whim , while @xmath4 is the redshift of interevening gas weighted by the whim gas density , both of which can be evaluated for a given cosmology model solely from the dm of an frb . using data on structure formation simulations and a model igmf , we show that @xmath1 closely reproduces the density - weighted line - of - sight strength of the igmf in filaments of the large - scale structure . </S>"
