    "the binding energy of the nucleus , or its mass , contains information about interactions between its constituent protons and neutrons .",
    "precision mass data as well as separation energies extracted from them can unveil much about the underlying nuclear structure  @xcite .",
    "for instance , magic numbers can easily be seen from separation energies which reveal a huge drop ( depending on the size of the closed shell ) , or a jump or a gap ( depending on the way the separation energy is constructed ) after a magic number  @xcite .",
    "in addition , separation energies can reflect collective effects as we will discuss below .",
    "such data are therefore valuable in understanding the underlying shell structure in nuclei and the evolution of collective effects , and are therefore essential to provide the basis for the development and testing of a comprehensive theory of nuclei . in turn",
    ", a reliable nuclear theory is of utmost importance for calculating the properties of unknown nuclei , which are needed , for example , in the modelling of the rapid neutron capture process ( r - process ) of nucleosynthesis in stars  @xcite .",
    "therefore , new data on neutron - rich heavy nuclei are essential",
    ".    however , such data are scarce mainly due to the complexity of producing these exotic nuclei .",
    "this becomes evident if one glances at the chart of nuclides ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) where for elements @xmath8 the number of observed neutron - rich nuclides is very limited .",
    "very recently , several tens of new isotopes were discovered in projectile fragmentation of uranium beams , though no spectroscopic information could yet be obtained for these nuclei  @xcite .",
    "their production rates are tiny , which requires very efficient measurement techniques .",
    "one such technique for mass measurements is storage - ring mass spectrometry  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on direct mass measurements of neutron - rich nuclei in the element range from lutetium to osmium .",
    "masses for nine nuclei were measured for the first time , and for three nuclei the mass uncertainty was improved .",
    "it is known that nuclear collective effects can be seen in the behavior of nucleon separation energies  @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the relation between rather subtle effects in two - neutron separation energies , @xmath9 , and changes in both collectivity and neutron number . observed irregularities in the smooth two - neutron separation energies for hf and w isotopes",

    "the experiment was conducted at gsi helmholtzzentrum fr schwerionenforschung in darmstadt .",
    "heavy neutron - rich nuclei of interest were produced in projectile fragmentation of @xmath0au primary beams .",
    "the experiment described here was part of a larger experimental campaign , some results of which are described in refs .",
    "the @xmath0au beams were accelerated to the energy of 11.4  mev / u in the linear accelerator unilac and then injected into the heavy ion synchrotron sis-18  @xcite , where they were further accelerated to an energy of 469.35  mev / u .",
    "the @xmath0au@xmath12 beams were fast extracted ( within about 1  @xmath13s ) and focused on a production target located at the entrance of the fragment separator frs  @xcite . as target we used 1036  mg/@xmath14 thick @xmath15be with a 221  mg/@xmath14 nb backing for more efficient electron stripping .",
    "the reaction products emerged from the target as highly - charged ions having mostly 0 , 1 , or 2 bound electrons .",
    "the nuclides of interest were transported through the frs , being operated as a pure magnetic rigidity ( @xmath16 ) analyzer  @xcite , and injected into the cooler - storage ring esr  @xcite .",
    "the transmission through the frs and the injection into the esr were optimized with the primary beam , and the magnetic setting of frs - esr was fixed at @xmath17  tm throughout the entire experiment .",
    "all ion species within the acceptance of the frs - esr of about @xmath18% were injected and stored .",
    "only @xmath19% of the esr acceptance is filled at the injection .",
    "we note , that in contrast to the settings described in refs .",
    "@xcite , in this experiment no energy - loss degraders were employed in the frs .",
    "the relationship between relative revolution frequencies ( @xmath20 ) , relative mass - over - charge ratios ( @xmath21 ) and velocities ( @xmath22 ) of the particles stored in a ring is given by  @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the relativistic lorentz factor , @xmath25 is the momentum compaction factor , which characterizes the relative variation of the orbit length of stored particles per relative variation of their magnetic rigidity ( for more details see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for the esr",
    ", @xmath25 is nearly constant for the entire revolution frequency acceptance and is @xmath26 . from eq .",
    "it becomes obvious that the revolution frequency is a measure of the mass - over - charge ratios of the stored ions provided that the second term on the right hand side , containing the velocity spread ( @xmath27 ) , can be eliminated .",
    "the latter is achieved by applying electron cooling  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "the stored ions are merged over a length of about 2.5  m with a continuous beam of electrons in the electron cooler device .",
    "the mean circumference of the esr is 108.4  m and at our energies the ions circulate with a frequency of about 2  mhz passing the electron cooler at each revolution .",
    "the energy of the electrons is very accurately defined by the applied acceleration potential . within a few seconds",
    "the mean velocity of the ions becomes equal to the mean velocity of the electrons .",
    "the velocity spread of the stored ions , which is @xmath28 at the injection , is thereby reduced to @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the schottky mass spectrometry ( sms ) technique has been applied to the electron cooled ions  @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "every stored highly - charged ion at each revolution in the esr induces mirror charges on a couple of parallel electrostatic copper plates , the schottky pick - up installed inside the ring aperture .",
    "the noise from the pick - up , which is dominated by the thermal noise , is amplified by a broad - band low - noise amplifier  @xcite . in the present experiment",
    ", we analyzed the noise power at about 60  mhz , corresponding to the 30@xmath30 harmonic of the revolution frequency of the stored ions .",
    "the pick - up signal was down - mixed using a @xmath3160  mhz reference frequency from an external frequency generator .",
    "the acceptance of the esr at the 30@xmath30 harmonic corresponds to about 320  khz  @xcite .",
    "therefore , to cover the entire esr acceptance we digitized the signal with a sampling frequency of 640  khz using a commercial 16-bit adc  @xcite .",
    "a fourier transform of the digitized data yielded the noise - power density spectrum , or the schottky frequency spectrum  @xcite .",
    "new ions were injected every few minutes . at the injection into the esr ,",
    "the previously stored ions were removed .",
    "several schottky frequency spectra were created for each injection .",
    "the parameters of the fourier transform algorithm were optimized offline .",
    "a frequency resolution of 4.77  hz / channel was chosen , which corresponds to the time resolution of 0.21  s per spectrum .",
    "furthermore , every 50 consecutive schottky spectra were averaged to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "thus , schottky spectra integrated over 10  s were produced .",
    "the latter means that several independent subsequent frequency spectra were obtained for each injection of the ions into the esr .",
    "the electron cooling forces the ions to the same mean velocity thus filling the entire acceptance of the esr of @xmath32 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . since @xmath33 , by changing the velocity of the electrons in different injections , ions with different @xmath21 can be studied . in the present experiment we varied the electron cooler voltage in the range from 204  kv to 218  kv . on average eight injections",
    "were recorded for each cooler setting . in order to facilitate the assignment of the revolution frequencies with the corresponding isotope identification",
    ", all spectra within each cooler setting were combined together . in this case",
    "the maximum number of ion species present in each setting can be used for the identification .",
    "the latter is done based on eq .  .",
    "as a starting point for the identification we used the frequency of the stored @xmath0au@xmath34 primary ions .",
    "an example of the combined schottky frequency spectrum for an electron cooler voltage of @xmath35  kv is illustrated in fig .",

    "correspondingly , these nuclei have @xmath82-factors of 4.4 and 3 , respectively . the greater collectivity of @xmath81w compared to @xmath76os suggested by their @xmath82-factors is reflected in its lower 2@xmath68 energies as seen in fig .  [ s2n_e2 ] ( right ) .",
    "thus , for two reasons  both greater collectivity and more valence nucleons ",
    "the collective binding should be much greater in @xmath81w than in @xmath76os and changes in binding energies ( @xmath90 values ) should be on a larger scale .",
    "we suggest that this accounts for the fact that we see a flattening in @xmath81w clearly but not in @xmath76os in fig .",
    "[ s2n_e2 ] ( left ) . obviously , it is very important to have new data , both masses and spectroscopic information , on even more neutron rich w isotopes although such experiments are difficult .",

    "similarly , mass and spectroscopic measurements are suggested for nuclei such as yb with @xmath131 . to conclude , these new data illustrate subtle changes in structure and the correlation with @xmath67(2@xmath68 ) reveals a valuable way to correlate changes in structure in terms of both masses and spectroscopic observables .",
    "of course , to quantitatively test these ideas requires a systematic collective model study of the mass - structure relationship in this region .",
