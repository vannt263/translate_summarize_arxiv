    "frustration in magnetic systems is usually of geometrical origin , but it may also arise due to competing exchange interactions .",
    "@xcite a common feature of frustrated spin systems is that the interactions along different bonds compete with one another , and this leads in some cases to disordered states and to quantum phase transitions when the interaction strength is varied .",
    "another possibility is so - called `` order - by - disorder '' , and several microscopic mechanisms which stabilize ordered state in spin systems have been investigated.@xcite here we shall focus on the triangular lattice , where frustrated interactions suggest that valence - bond configurations in spin model with antiferromagnetic ( af ) interactions could play an important role , @xcite and we supplement them in this work by the frustrated orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "recently interesting physical realizations of frustrated interactions were introduced in the context of spin - orbital superexchange which arises in transition metal oxides with active orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite in such models frustration is intrinsic and follows from the directional nature of orbital interactions.@xcite therefore , the orbital part of the spin - orbital superexchange is frustrated even _ without _ any geometrical frustration .",
    "generic features of this direction - dependent interactions are captured within the two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum compass model,@xcite which exhibits a quantum phase transition through an isotropic point with highly degenerate ground state ( gs).@xcite this high degeneracy is a fingerprint of highly frustrated interactions and occurs also in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) compass model.@xcite it is also characterized by a rather surprising hidden dimer order in the gs which follows from the symmetry of compass interactions.@xcite    frustration in the orbital superexchange models is somewhat more subtle  the interactions depend on the type of active orbital degree of freedom and in each case differ from those in the quantum compass model . in case of @xmath2",
    "orbitals the interactions are directional as in the quantum compass model , but they are ising - type only for one cubic axis , e.g. for the bonds @xmath3 along the @xmath4 cubic axis one has the interaction @xmath5 , while for the bonds @xmath3 in the @xmath6 planes they involve linear combinations of @xmath7 operators which arise from the directional orbital states along the considered ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) axis @xcite ( here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are pauli matrices ) .",
    "this particular structure follows from the fact that although only one of @xmath2 orbital states participates in charge excitations along each single cubic axis and the interactions appear to be classical in a 1d @xmath2 orbital model,@xcite their superposition is quantum either in a 2d model,@xcite or in a three - dimensional one.@xcite in contrast , two @xmath1 orbitals are active and participate in charge excitations along each cubic direction , so the respective interactions involve _ a priori _ all three components of the orbital pseudospin @xmath12 doublet , with the restriction that the active orbital @xmath1 doublet changes with the cubic axis .",
    "@xcite for instance , where the degeneracy of @xmath1 orbitals is removed by crystal field in the vanadium perovskites and @xmath13 orbitals are filled , the @xmath14 orbital doublet contributes with orbital fluctuations to the bonds along the @xmath4 axis.@xcite    realistic superexchange models for perovskite transition metal oxides include both orbital and spin degrees of freedom , which are strongly interrelated.@xcite two important questions for these models are : ( i ) whether the orbital frustration can be removed by properly selected spin states , or frustration is even enhanced by spin - orbital quantum fluctuations , and ( ii ) to what extent spin dynamics may be treated as independent of orbital dynamics.@xcite the disordered gs was suggested for the @xmath1 orbitals in @xmath0 configuration on the perovskite lattice.@xcite    in the present paper we want to focus on the model derived for the transition metal ions in @xmath0 configuration for the triangular lattice,@xcite with frustration being both of orbital and geometrical origin .",
    "this spin - orbital model corresponds to the undistorted natio@xmath15 and describes magnetic interactions in the spin - orbital space , with superexchange and direct exchange . in the direct exchange case",
    "the model is exactly solvable and the gs was determined by considering the dimer coverings of the lattice , with each dimer containing a spin singlet accompanied by two active orbitals on the direct exchange bond.@xcite in a general case the gs and the ratio of superexchange and direct exchange are not known  the latter depends on the respective effective hopping elements via the oxygen orbitals responsible for the superexchange and the @xmath16 hopping which gives the direct exchange .",
    "therefore , we use it below as a model parameter .",
    "a second parameter of the spin - orbital model considered here is hund s exchange interaction .",
    "one might expect that also in case of superexchange interactions @xmath1 orbitals could order and remove the frustration in the triangular lattice , as they do , for instance , in livo@xmath15.@xcite it was argued , however , in ref . that the gs of the present @xmath0 spin - orbital model is disordered and dominated by dimer correlations practically for any ratio of the superexchange and direct exchange interaction .",
    "this conclusion was drawn by considering the mean - field ( mf ) states , variational wave functions with valence - bond correlations , and exact diagonalization of small systems of not more than @xmath17 sites .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to reanalyze the spin - orbital states in the @xmath0 spin - orbital model on the triangular lattice,@xcite and provide evidence in favor of the disordered spin - orbital liquid gs from numerical studies of larger finite systems , having up to @xmath18 sites .",
    "we use extensively lanczos diagonalization , but for rather small systems of size up to @xmath19 sites where full diagonalization is also possible in the subspace of @xmath20 total spin , both methods were compared with each other .",
    "thereby , we addressed a few general questions which concern the spin - orbital physics for varying parameters of the model : ( i ) nature of dimer spin and orbital correlations , ( ii ) nature of the transition to the spin - polarized ferromagnetic ( fm ) state with increasing hund s exchange , ( iii ) importance of spin - orbital entanglement@xcite and its consequences for the transition from low - spin to high - spin states",

    "this qualitative limitation could play a role particularly in disordered systems , where the physical consequences of entangled spin - orbital states are more severe .    in summary , the present spin - orbital model on the triangular lattice provides a beautiful example of highly frustrated interactions with the ground state dominated by : ( i ) quantum fluctuations , and ( ii ) spin - orbital entanglement .",

    "<S> we investigate the ground state of the @xmath0 spin - orbital model for triply degenerate @xmath1 orbitals on a triangular lattice which unifies intrinsic frustration of spin and orbital interactions with geometrical frustration . using full or lanczos exact diagonalization of finite clusters we establish that the ground state of the spin - orbital model which interpolates between the superexchange and direct exchange interactions on the bonds is characterized by valence - bond correlations . in the absence of hund s </S>",
    "<S> exchange the model describes a competition between various possible valence - bond states . by considering the clusters with open boundary conditions </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that orbital interactions are always frustrated , but this frustration is removed by pronounced spin singlet correlations which coexist with supporting them dimer orbital correlations . </S>",
    "<S> such local configurations contribute to the disordered ground states found for the clusters with periodic boundary conditions which interpolate between a highly resonating , dimer - based , entangled spin - orbital liquid phase , and a valence - bond state with completely static spin - singlet states . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these states are also realized for the infinite lattice and anticipate that pronounced transitions between different regimes found for particular geometries will turn out to smooth crossovers in the properties of the spin - orbital liquid in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we provide evidence that the resonating spin - orbital liquid phase involves entangled states on the bonds . </S>",
    "<S> in such a phase classical considerations based on the mean - field theory can not be used , spin exchange interactions do not determine spin bond correlations , and quantum fluctuations play a crucial role in the ground states and magnetic transitions . + _ published in : physical review b * 83 * , 094406 ( 2011 ) . _ </S>"
