    "next figure ( fig .  ( [ udep ] ) ) depicts the dependence of the renormalized magnons on the correlations in the conduction band ( @xmath67 ) , at half - filling : the trend is a hardening of magnons when @xmath67 is increased ( such hardening appears also for the mfa magnons ) , and we show cases where @xmath198 ranges between 0.008 ( for @xmath199 ) and 0.83 ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "this may be understood by the reinforcement of u - dependent antiferromagnetism ( spin polarization ) in the conduction band , which renders conduction electrons less available to follow easily the spin excitation determined by magnon excitation in the local moment subsystem : an energetic cost is involved .",
    "in fact , the magnon gap value we obtain at @xmath201 is directly related to the correlation value , and to the symmetry breaking involved in our treatment when the itinerant antiferromagnetism of the conduction band is considered ( as was also reported in previous work on spin excitations in manganites ) .",
    "@xcite notice that increasing @xmath67 also reduces q - dependent details in the renormalized magnons : this can be explained by analizing the indirect effect which @xmath67 has on magnons ( while @xmath16 has also a direct effect , since it appears also as explicit multiplicative factor of the perturbatively obtained magnon corrections ) .",
    "@xmath67 affects magnons through the modifications it induces in electron bandstructure , and in particular the @xmath67-driven increase of energy denominators of the perturbative coefficients which determine the q - dependent renormalization of magnons ( details in the appendix ) , which explains the above mentioned result .",
    "the recent more refined dmft+nrg treatment of correlations in an extended kondo lattice model@xcite unfortunately does not allow us comparison , here , as their finite u results are presented for antiferromagnetic @xmath16 outside the region of interest in our problem : their correlated af kondo coupling system is studied at much too large kondo coupling ( namely , @xmath202 ) for the antiferromagnetic state to remain stable , being the kondo insulator with all moments locally quenched the stable phase near half filling in that case .",

    "the deviation of the renormalized magnon energies from the bare magnon values is increased with the filling : at half - filling the renormalization is largest , there being more conduction electrons present , which contribute to the renormalization of magnons by their kondo coupling to the local moments . doping away from half - filling we",
    "obtain a smooth reduction of such renormalization effects .",
    "thus , both filling and electron correlation do increase renormalization effects , and we have already mentioned that both result in similar increases of spin polarization of the conduction band .",
    "we will shortly come back to this point , when introducing our last figure .",
    "let us briefly refer again to the q - dependence of the af magnon renormalization we find .",
    "some anisotropy is present : a larger q - dependence is noticeable along bz diagonal paths such as @xmath205 or @xmath206 ( see e.g. fig .",
    "( [ ndep ] ) ) or paths along the symmetry axes .",
    "while the renormalization effects are more pronounced at long wavelenghts : in particular , they are maximal at the bz center where we find a spin stiffness increasing with doping , and decreasing with u or @xmath189 .",
    "making allowance for the quite different systems involved , let us mention that the renormalized af magnon behavior we obtain contrasts with the one recently disclosed by ins measurements in _ ferromagnetic metallic manganites_:@xcite where low - q spin wave stiffness appears insensitive to doping , while magnons exhibit a doping - dependent renormalization at the bz boundaries ( recently suggested to be related to electronic correlations@xcite ) .    .",

    "( [ nearcein3 ] ) we show magnon results we obtained with three different sets of model parameters : as can be seen , all of them providing a reasonably good description of the measured cein@xmath5 magnons.@xcite at the same time , these parameter sets yield examples of behavior of the magnon renormalization of the model discussed above :    \\(a ) the first parameter set used in fig .",
    "6 provides an example of convergence of our perturbative expansion for a case with @xmath209 , at half - filling and with negligible @xmath67 ; notice a slightly larger q - dependence is obtained in this case ( to be expected from the q - dependent expressions of the perturbative coefficients ) : e.g. easily noticeable different height of the main peaks ( at symmetry points m and r ) is visible ;    \\(b ) with parameter set ( b ) of fig .",

    "cein@xmath5 magnons is obtained ( considering our calculations are done for sc magnetic sublattices ( thus bcc lattice ) , while cein@xmath5 in fact is fcc ) .",
    "the agreement here is slightly better than with set ( a ) .",
    "this shows how delicate the interplay between the different parameters of the model is : since , compared with parameter set ( a ) , here we obtain a quite similar result at half - filling but with @xmath210 and @xmath211 ;    \\(c ) finally we illustrate that we can obtain a quite similar description of the cein@xmath5 measured magnons away from half filling : e.g. assuming @xmath212 but compensating the decrease in electron energy due to doping by an increase in band correlation : taking @xmath213 while keeping @xmath214 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that these sets of parameters allowing description of ins results are in parameter ranges independently suggested by other authors for these compounds .",
    "a concrete example is the phenomenological fit of specific heat curves for cein@xmath5 , which was made by lobos et al.,@xcite using : @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 ; while for cerh@xmath11si@xmath11 they have used : @xmath219 and @xmath220 ; and their data extrapolation for cepd@xmath11si@xmath11 was : @xmath219 with a negligible @xmath189 .",
    "in the present work , we have studied spin wave excitations in heavy fermion compounds with antiferromagnetic long - range order , where a strong competition of rkky and kondo screening is present , as evidenced by nearly equal magnetic ordering and kondo temperatures .",
    "we have described these systems using a microscopic model including a lattice of correlated f - electron orbitals ( as in ce- , u- compounds of this family ) hybridized with a correlated conduction band , with the presence of competing rkky - heisenberg and kondo magnetic couplings .    through a series of unitary transformations we perturbatively derived a second - order effective hamiltonian describing the spin wave excitations , renormalized by their interaction with the conduction electrons .",
    "we have numerically studied the effect of the different parameters of this effective model on the magnon energy renormalization by the conduction electrons .",
    "we have been able to find appropriate sets of model parameters to describe the few existing measurements of magnons by inelastic neutron scattering in single crystal samples of antiferromagnetic heavy fermion ce compounds .",
    "these parameter sets also agree with the ranges proposed for these compounds , through phenomenological fits of other experiments , like specific heat .",
    "our results may provide information of interest for the prediction of inelastic neutron scattering experiments in other compounds of this family , like cerh@xmath11si@xmath11 , where there have been suggestions that the rkky coupling should be stronger than kondo effect,@xcite and the only existing nis measurements are of poor quality : they were made on polycrystals@xcite many years ago , and with lower resolution .",
    "as outlook towards related future work , we might mention the description of the experimentally reported magnon damping effects , and the study of the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in the context of the present model .",
