    "if @xmath95 is an odd positive integer , then from the proof of the theorem [ size ] , we see that the degree of every vertex of @xmath49 is an even integer .",

    ".    edge connectivity of @xmath49 is @xmath64 .",
    "we have diameter of @xmath49 is @xmath108 .",
    "so , by theorem 3.1 @xcite , its edge connectivity is equal to its minimum degree , i.e. @xmath64",
    ".    deletion of the vertex @xmath44 makes the graph @xmath49 disconnected .",
    "hence we have the following result .",
    "the vertex connectivity of the graph @xmath49 is @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath49 is planar if and only if @xmath109 .",
    "every 1-dimensional subspace of @xmath0 is a complete subgraph of @xmath49 .",
    "so , for @xmath110 , @xmath49 contains @xmath111 , the complete subgraph of @xmath49 of five vertices , which is nonplanar .",
    "rest of the result follows from figure 1 .",
    "in this section , we determine the eigen values of the adjacency matrix , the laplacian matrix and the distance matrix of the graph @xmath49 .",
    "we note that the elements of an 1-dimensional subspace of @xmath0 are adjacent with each other .",
    "so , the adjacency matrix @xmath112 of @xmath49 , is given below , where rows and columns are indexed by the vertices @xmath44 and the non - zero elements of all 1-dimensional subspaces successively .",
    "thus      order of this matrix is @xmath114 .",
    "hence @xmath115 is a matrix of order @xmath60 .",
    "also @xmath115 is a block diagonal matrix , having @xmath116 blocks each of order @xmath64 and entries on the principal diagonal are @xmath31 and @xmath69 otherwise .",
    "also , the degree of the null vector is @xmath60 and the degree of all other elements is @xmath64 .",
    "so the diagonal matrix of vertex degrees of @xmath49 is                                                                          the second smallest eigen value of the laplacian matrix @xmath156 of a graph @xmath135 , is denoted by @xmath157 .",
    "this quantity shares many properties with the vertex or edge - connectivity and according to fiedler @xcite , is called the algebraic connectivity of @xmath135 .",
    "so , from theorem [ laplacianpoly ] , we have the following result .",
