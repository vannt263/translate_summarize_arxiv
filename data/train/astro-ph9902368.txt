    "since its discovery as an extremely low - metallicity galaxy , the blue compact galaxy ( bcg ) sbs 0335052 ( sbs  second byurakan survey ) has been seen as a good candidate to be a nearby , young dwarf galaxy ( izotov et al .",

    "the emission from the underlying component , with @xmath6 = 0.00.2 , would seem to arise from the combination of ionized gas emission and emission from young ( @xmath710@xmath8 yr ) stars ( izotov et al .",

    "another piece of evidence favoring of a young age for sbs 0335052 has been presented by thuan & izotov ( 1997 ) from _ hst _ @xmath9 spectrophotometry .",

    "the heavy element abundances in neutral gas are several orders of magnitude lower than those in the ionized gas ( thuan & izotov 1997 ) .",
    "the very large array ( vla ) map of sbs  0335052 reveals the presence at the same redshift of a large extended h i cloud , 64 kpc in size , with a mass two orders of magnitude larger than that of the observed stars ( pustilnik et al .",
    "two prominent , slightly - resolved h i peaks have been detected , separated by 22 kpc .",
    "the eastern peak coincides approximately with sbs 0335052 .",

    "( 1997 ) sought to identify the western h i peak using the digital sky survey ( dss ) and found an optical counterpart designated as sbs  0335052w .",

    "the oxygen abundance in both of the brightest regions of sbs 0335052w is 0.10.2 dex smaller than in sbs 0335052 ( izotov et al . 1997 ) and is the same as that in i zw 18 ( sk93 ) .",

    "the smoothing scale of the adaptive filter was 11@xmath1211 pixels . before applying an adaptive filter",

    "such a mask is necessary for proper determination of noise statistics used by the filter .",

    "more evidence for a common evolution of the two h ii regions in the sbs 0335052 system comes from spectroscopic observations of sbs 0335052w .",
    "the spectra of this h ii region , shown in figures 1 and 2 , resemble a spectrum of more moderate excitation as compared with the spectrum of the brighter companion and shows stronger low excitation [ o ii]@xmath153727 emission .",

    "however , _ hst _ wfpc2 observations of sbs 0335052 ( til97 , papaderos et al .",

    "the age of the oldest extended low - intensity stellar population in sbs 0335052 is @xmath18 100 myr ( izotov et al .",
    "1997 ; til97 ) .",
    "these observations imply that the assumption of an instantaneous burst of star formation is not valid . instead , star formation in sbs 0335052 during last @xmath18 100 myr would be consistent with propagating star formation from nw to se at a velocity @xmath18 18 km s@xmath17 in a region of @xmath18 1 kpc in size ( papaderos et al . 1998 ) .",
    "a similar situation is observed in the other known very metal - deficient galaxy , i zw 18 , where star formation likely propagated in the se direction from the older c component to the youngest se component ( izotov & thuan 1998b ) .    while the youngest ionizing cluster in the sbs 0335052w seems to be older than that in the sbs",

    "the surface brightness distribution in @xmath1 for sbs 0335052 is in a good agreement with that obtained by til97 and the total @xmath1 magnitude derived from both observations is coincident within 0.05 mag .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 profiles for sbs 0335052 and sbs 0335052w at large distances are fitted well by an exponential .",
    "the @xmath3 color in both hii regions gets redder with increasing radius .",
    "izotov et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that the @xmath6 color of the extended stellar emission is strongly modified by the emission of ionized gas .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "3b that the @xmath3 color in sbs 0335052w is affected by the presence of ionized gas emission but to a lesser extent than in sbs 0335052 where gaseous emission is stronger .",

    "the sharp change of @xmath3 between 0.17 at log @xmath36=8.0 and 0.36 at log @xmath36=8.1 is caused by the appearance of the first asymptotic giant branch stars , where @xmath36 is expressed in yr .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath37 colors are even more sensitive to the appearance of the first asymptotic giant branch stars and , therefore , they are better discriminators between young and old stellar populations .",
    "it follows from table 4 that the observed @xmath3 = 0.2 in the outer envelope of sbs 0335052w can be explained only by the presence of a stellar population with age @xmath7100 myr .",
    "the assumption of a continuous star formation rate in the galaxy with an age @xmath7 100 myr does not change its colors appreciably due to the weak dependence of colors on age at @xmath36 = 10  100 myr ( table 4 ) which is the most likely age for the extended stellar component in sbs 0335052 and its western counterpart .",
    "of course , we can not exclude completely the presence of an old stellar population simply because the young stellar population dominates the radiation .",
    "however , if present , the extended old population in the sbs 0335052 is less significant than in the majority of bcgs where it is easily detected .",
    "hence , the @xmath16 photometric results contradict neither the hypothesis of a young age for sbs  0335052 and sbs  0335052w , nor their common origin during the last @xmath7100 myr .",
    "however , as the @xmath3 color is a weak discriminator of the age of a stellar population , photometric observations in other broad bands are necessary to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "the existence of two young regions of star formation separated by 24 kpc poses the problem of identifying a mechanism for synchronizing star formation .",

    "no stellar or ionized gaseous optical emission is detected between both the components ( papaderos et al . 1998 ) .",
    "these observations argue against models where star formation in two widely separated regions is caused by the collision of two gaseous clouds or by tidal effects .",
