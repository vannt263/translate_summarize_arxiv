    "this paper introduces a simple stochastic model , an ehrenfest model with large jumps ( elj ) , to explain the observed fact that the density function of price change fits well to a symmetrical lvy stable distribution near the central part of the density function , while it has a truncated tail far from the center @xcite .",
    "the proposed model also explains that it is close to a gaussian distribution for long sampling intervals .",
    "changes in stock prices and exchange rates for currencies are one of the best examples to which the random walk concept is applicable @xcite .",
    "we have seen a lot of work of related topics since the work of l. bachelier in 1900 . in financial theory such as the argument on the black - scholes model , the distribution of ( logarithmic ) stock returns is assumed to be gaussian .",
    "it seems that this assumption is well accepted for a long sampling interval of empirical data , namely those for sampling intervals of several days , a week or longer .    in the case of a short sampling interval of empirical data ,",
    "i.e. those for sampling intervals of several seconds , minutes or hours , the price returns are not distributed according to a gaussian law @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath1 for the empirical density function of the s&p500 index estimated for short sampling intervals indicates that the density function follows a stable law ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .    the price changes are therefore said to be distributed according to a stable law with a characteristic exponent @xmath0 for short sampling intervals , and a gaussian distribution ( @xmath2 ) for long sampling intervals @xcite .",
    "the ehrenfest model @xcite envisages two boxes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 particles distributed in these boxes .",
    "a particle is chosen at random and moved from one box to the other and the same procedure is repeated .",
    "we consider a generalized ehrenfest model in which @xmath6 steps of the ehrenfest model take place with probability @xmath7 at each step , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a normalization constant defined by : for simplicity , @xmath10 is fixed to be 1 in the following discussion .",
    "this generalized model becomes identical to the original ehrenfest model in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "suppose that initially there are @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) particles in box @xmath3 , after repeating the above procedure @xmath14 times , there are @xmath15 particles in box @xmath3 .",
    "the probability of this event calculated in case of the original ehrenfest model @xcite can be described as : where with the duration of each step for the original ehrenfest model defined as @xmath16 , consider a particle moving along the @xmath17-axis in such a way that at the time @xmath18 it is located at @xmath19 . in the diffusion limit : we have where we denote the particle number in the box @xmath3 after @xmath14 steps as @xmath20 , and define the changes as : where @xmath21 denotes the step interval . using the above @xmath22",
    ", we define the empirical density @xmath23 as : where @xmath24 and @xmath25 denotes the kronecker delta .    using eq .",
    "( [ ehrenfest kac ] ) , the probability density function of the changes @xmath22 for the proposed model @xmath26 is expressed as : where @xmath27 = 0,1,2 , .... using the diffusion approximation , the above equation can be approximated by eq .",
    "( [ p(z ) our ehrenfest ] ) .    assuming that the initial density function is given by a gaussian density function @xmath28 , the probability density function of the change @xmath29 in the original ehrenfest model , obtained from the diffusion approximation ( [ ehrenfest p(x_0|x ; t ) ] ) ,",
    "is given by : where @xmath30 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the variance of the change @xmath29 is given by :    , title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] +  @xmath31    figure [ fig .",
    "variance ] shows the behavior of the function : from this figure , we find that when both @xmath32 and @xmath33 are sufficiently large , the difference @xmath34 remains small , even if @xmath32 and @xmath33 are very different .",
    "the time series of the elj is interpreted as a time series chosen randomly from that of the original ehrenfest model .",
    "( [ p(z ) ehrenfest ] ) , the probability density function of the elj is approximated as : and the variance as : when @xmath35 is large , the density of elj in eq .",
    "( [ p(z ) our ehrenfest ] ) will be approximately given by : with where @xmath36 of the summation is an integer satisfying the condition @xmath37 . from the above equation",
    ", we find that the density of the proposed model decays in proportion to @xmath38 toward the end of the tail as seen in fig .",
    "[ density m q2b3 with the lines estimated by log likelihood ] ( a ) , whereas in fig .",
    "[ density m q2b3 with the lines estimated by log likelihood ] ( b ) , the tail decays in proportion to @xmath39 to mid - way when @xmath21 is small .",
    "the lvy stable symmetrical density function is given by : for the characteristic exponent @xmath1 ( @xmath40 ) and positive scale factor @xmath41 .",
    "this reduces to a gaussian density function when @xmath1 = 2 .",
    "the lvy stable density is characterized by a fat tail and kurtosis , is consistent with empirical data , and satisfies a scaling law .",
    "it is one of the most natural generalization of the gaussian distribution which is stable with respect to convolution .    from eq .",
    "( [ p(z ) our ehrenfest ] ) , we find the reason that the stable density function @xmath42 is chosen for the best fitting density function of the proposed model for shorter @xmath21 by the maximum likelihood method that we will explain later .",
    "the large coefficient of @xmath43 in the exponential function gives a sharper peak at the origin , in contrast , the small coefficient of @xmath43 affords a flatter peak , broadening the density function .",
    "therefore , the density function given by the sum of these two types of terms with dissimilar coefficients has a fatter tail than the gaussian density function .",
    "when @xmath21 is sufficiently large , the density function on proposed model becomes the sum of the gaussian density functions of almost the same shape .",
    "therefore , the density function in the proposed model is given by the gaussian density function for longer sampling intervals .",
    "the proposed model well describes the changes in the stock indices such as the s&p500 , topix and currency exchange rates .",
    "let each particle in the box @xmath3 represent a buy stance dealer and each particle in the box @xmath4 represent a sell stance dealer .",
    "these dealers will get a lot of information from a newspaper , television , radio , business reports etc . on business conditions , weather reports , governmental decisions etc . and their view will be changed from buy to sell or from sell to buy on the basis of such information .",
    "these changes will generate a change in the stock price or the exchange rate .",
    "we assume that a change in the dealer s mind directly causes a change in the price so that @xmath44 is interpreted as the price .",
    "as the information is spatially and temporally distributed , and any piece of information may have a different impact on the dealers , the price will sometimes change drastically within minutes , or sometimes only slightly over hours . the difference between the progress of time in the elj and in the original ehrenfest model describes this phenomenon . the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 might thus represent the dealers ( price change ) sensitivity and frequency of information .",
    "the maximum likelihood method @xcite is employed to estimate parameters of the model .",
    "it is assume that a joint density function @xmath47 of the random variable @xmath48 is given , where the parameter @xmath49 specifies the density function .",
    "if the random variables are mutually independent , then the joint probability density function of @xmath48 is given as the product of the individual density functions of @xmath50 .",
    "thus we have taking the logarithm on the right - hand side yields the log likelihood : for the present case , the log likelihood is expressed as : the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters of the model is obtained by maximizing this quantity .",
    "the results of a numerical simulation of the trajectory of @xmath44 is shown in fig .  [",
    "m , q2b3 ] , where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "big jumps that do not exist in the original ehrenfest model are observed in the proposed model . because of these big jumps ,",
    "the empirical density @xmath23 of the new model is a better fit to a stable distribution ( @xmath0 ) , whereas the empirical density @xmath23 is given by a gaussian distribution in the original ehrenfest model .",

    "these results were obtained for a sequence of about one million steps of the elj .",
