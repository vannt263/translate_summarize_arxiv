    "quantum state engineering has been a subject of increasing interest and various methods for generating highly nonclassical states of optical fields have been proposed . a promising method for generating novel quantum states",
    "has been conditional measurement .",
    "in fact , when a system , such as a correlated two - mode optical field or a correlated atom - field system , is prepared in an entangled state of two subsystems and a measurement is performed on one subsystem , then the quantum state of the other subsystem can be reduced to a new state . in particular , it turned out that conditional measurement on a beam splitter may be advantageously used for generating new classes of quantum states @xcite .",
    "very interesting states are the so - called photon - added and photon - subtracted states that are obtained by repeated application of the photon creation and destruction operator , respectively , on a given state @xcite . in this paper we show that for various classes of states the corresponding photon - added and -subtracted states can be produced by means of conditional measurement on a beam splitter . in particular , when a signal mode is mixed with a reference mode prepared in a photon - number state and in one of the output channels no photons are detected , then the mode in the other output channel is prepared in a photon - added state .",
    "accordingly , a photon - subtracted state is produced when the reference mode is in the vacuum and the conditional output measurement yields a nonvanishing number of photons .",
    "typical examples of states the method applies to are thermal states , coherent states , squeezed states , displaced photon - number states and others .",
    "it is worth noting that photon - added and photon - subtracted squeezed vacuum states represent two different classes of schrdinger - cat - like states .",
    "we analyze the states in terms of quadrature - component distributions and phase - space functions and calculate the probability of producing them .",
    "finally we discuss modifications that may be observed under realistic experimental conditions .",

    "another class of schrdinger - cat - like states can be prepared when photons are not subtracted from a squeezed vacuum but added to it , which is the case when a squeezed vacuum is mixed with a photon - number state and a zero - photon conditional output measurement is performed .",
    "we have derived the quadrature - component distributions and the wigner and husimi functions for the two classes of states .",
    "further we have given the probabilities of preparing the states .",
    "it is worth noting that the component states of a schrdinger - cat - like state of the type of a photon - added squeezed vacuum can be regarded as non - gaussian squeezed coherent states that tend to the familiar gaussian squeezed coherent states ( two - photon coherent states ) as the number of added photons becomes sufficiently large .",
    "in contrast to photon adding , the component states of a schrdinger - cat - like state of the type of a photon - subtracted squeezed vacuum are , in a very good approximation , gaussian squeezed coherent states which with increasing number of subtracted photons approach ordinary coherent states .",
    "with regard to realistic experimental conditions , we have considered multichannel photon - number detection in photon - subtracted state generation as well as sub - poissonian photon - number input statistics in photon - added state generation .",
