    "interfacial instabilities arise in a wide variety of contexts , often of applied interest , such as dendritic growth , directional solidification , flows in porous media , flame propagation , electrodeposition , or bacterial growth @xcite . notwithstanding",
    "this disparity , there has been a search for unifying common features concerning the more fundamental problem of their underlying nonequilibrium dynamics .",
    "one such feature seems to be the role of anisotropy in determining the observed morphology .",
    "thus , the finding that anisotropy is necessary for the needle crystal to solve the steady state solidification problem ( see e.g. @xcite ) and indeed a critical amount of it to stabilize its tip and ( possibly ) generate side - branches in related local models @xcite motivated the inclusion of anisotropy in viscous fingering experiments , either by engraving the plates @xcite , or by using a liquid crystal @xcite . in turn , these experiments in anisotropic viscous fingering confirmed the existence of a tip - splitting / side - branching transition controlled by anisotropy and driving force .",
    "again , theoretical work on the solidification problem @xcite and numerical integration of its ( nonlocal ) dynamics @xcite showed the anisotropy in the surface tension to control the transition in this system together with the dimensionless undercooling . to our knowledge",
    ", no analytical or numerical work on anisotropic viscous fingering @xcite has focused on this transition so far .    in this way , a picture that some kind of anisotropy can control the tip - splitting or side - branching behavior of different systems emerged .",
    "however , it is still not clear how different these anisotropies and systems can be .",
    "on the one hand , not all kinds of anisotropy seem to control the transition .",
    "the channel walls in a viscous fingering experiment , for instance , are known to play the same role as surface tension anisotropy in free dendritic growth as far as the existence of a single finger steady state solution with surface tension is concerned . moreover , even with isotropic surface tension , this steady finger is stable up to a certain critical amount of noise @xcite , but no side - branching is observed , in contrast to free dendritic growth . above this threshold",
    "the tip splits , but again no side - branching is observed , in spite of the anisotropy due to the channel walls .",
    "it is necessary to introduce some other type of anisotropy to observe the transition to side - branching . on the other hand , some types of anisotropy not directly acting on the surface tension @xcite",
    "seem to actually control the transition in some systems , as is the case of liquid crystal viscous fingering experiments , which varied mainly the anisotropy in the viscosity , as well as etched cells , where the exact effect of the grooves on the free boundary equations is unclear .",
    "therefore a connection between surface tension anisotropy ( seen to control the transition in the solidification problem both experimentally and in simulations ) and other types of anisotropy clearly lacks . here",
    "we present such a connection for the case of a simple model of a liquid crystal .",
    "specifically , we show that two different viscosities in two perpendicular directions ( in addition to some already anisotropic surface tension ) can be mapped to a two - fold surface tension anisotropy ( times the rescaled original anisotropic surface tension ) through a convenient axis rescaling .",
    "moreover , we integrate the resulting problem to confirm the existence of the morphological transition also for the viscous fingering equations .",
    "the numerics use a previously developed @xcite and thoroughly tested @xcite phase - field model for viscous fingering .",
    "we do find such a transition as a function of the amount of anisotropy and the value of the dimensionless surface tension itself ( i.e. , the driving force for fixed surface tension ) .",
    "the results are consistent with experimental results in viscous fingering with a liquid crystal @xcite and etched cells @xcite , and also with theory and simulations for the solidification problem @xcite .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ secmod ] we refer to the special features of liquid crystals concerning viscous fingering and present a simple model for them .",
    "we then map this model onto the basic saffman - taylor problem with a two - fold anisotropy in the surface tension . in sec .",
    "[ secpf ] we briefly describe the phase - field model used and present the numerical results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ secdis ] we discuss their consequences for viscous fingering with a liquid crystal and consistency with related problems .",
    "in the nematic phase of a liquid crystal its molecules are locally oriented , giving rise to anisotropy in the viscosity and surface tension .",
    "the degree of orientation depends on the proximity of the other phase(s ) , namely the isotropic ( and for some liquid crystals the smectic ) , i.e. , it still depends on temperature , and so does the anisotropy , mainly in the viscosity @xcite",
    ". therefore one should be able to explain the tip - splitting / side - branching transition as a function of temperature in the nematics by means of the anisotropy in the viscosity alone .    in a viscous fingering experiment",
    ", the director forms a small angle with the velocity field , except maybe for the neighborhood of the interface , where it might follow its normal direction .",
    "so , as a first approximation , one can consider that there is flow alignment , and , therefore , a velocity dependent viscosity , which would make the flow nonlaplacian .",
    "however , in the vicinity of a finger tip we can approximate the direction of the flow for that of the finger , so that we can make a minimal model with only two different viscosities : one in the direction parallel to the finger and one in the perpendicular one .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us now review the formulation of the saffman ",
    "taylor equations to account for those two different viscosities in two perpendicular directions @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    ". we will do it for the channel geometry , although the result also applies to the circular cell used in the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite with minor changes .",
    "( i.e. two different viscosities in the radial and tangential directions would also map to the standard viscous fingering equations and the same functional dependence for the surface tension anisotropy ) .",
    "for the sake of generality , we consider both the displaced ( @xmath2 ) and the injected ( @xmath3 ) fluid to have a certain distinct viscosity ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) .    as in the usual saffman  taylor problem ,",
    "in each bulk we assume the flow to be incompressible , @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the fluid velocity in the reference frame moving with the mean interface at @xmath8 , the injection velocity ) , and also darcy s law to hold , but now for two different viscosities @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 stand for each fluid , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the @xmath0 , @xmath1 components of @xmath7 , @xmath15 is the pressure , @xmath16 is an inverse mobility in the @xmath0 direction , @xmath17 , in the @xmath1 direction , @xmath18 , the density , and @xmath19 , the effective gravity in the plane of the channel .",

    "@xcite ) . however , because of the different viscosities in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions , the problem is nonlaplacian ( there is vorticity ) in the bulk : @xmath29    to circumvent this , we rescale the @xmath0 and @xmath1 axis by a different factor",
    ". we also take advantage to adimensionalize the resulting equations in the same way as in refs .",
    "@xcite , so that they can be compared to those in these references , and especially to ref .",
    "@xcite in order to generalize the phase - field model described there to the case of anisotropic viscosity .",
    "thus , we perform the following change of variables : @xmath30 where tildes denote new variables , @xmath31 have units of length , @xmath32 is a velocity , and @xmath33 , the channel width .",
    "we find @xmath34 so that the flow is still incompressible and we can define a new stream function @xmath35 $ ] , which will be laplacian in the bulk if and only if [ see eq .",

    "( [ eq : choice ] ) , this implies that the ratio @xmath38 must be the same for both fluids . in an air - liquid crystal experiment , this is obviously not the case , but , in the limit in which the viscosity of the air is negligible compared to that of the liquid crystal , the anisotropic character of the air viscosity in our model becomes irrelevant . in terms of the stream function , eq .",

    "a similar result was found in a different context , namely for the nematic - smectic b transition , where two different heat diffusivities in two perpendicular directions could be mapped to the same type of anisotropy in the surface tension and the same type of transformation in the original anisotropy @xcite .",
    "however , note that here the assumption is that the growth is in the direction of lowest viscosity ( because of flow alignment of the director ) , which results in growth in the direction of largest surface tension ( @xmath68 ) , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite the situation is just the opposite : growth was found to be in the direction of lowest diffusivity because that is the direction of lowest capillary length . also for isotropic diffusivities it is known that steady needle crystals can only grow in the direction of minimal capillary length @xcite , although there the anisotropy is assumed to be four - fold .",
    "finally , for the described minimal model the original anisotropy in the surface tension would be two - fold , e.g. @xmath69 so that the transformed anisotropy would read @xmath70",

    "this model was introduced for isotropic viscous fingering in ref .",
    "@xcite and extensively tested in ref .",
    "@xcite . from this work",
    "we know that it will yield converged results for the steady fingers ( and , in particular , for their widths ) if both @xmath81 and @xmath82 . the only change to be made for the anisotropic case is to set @xmath83 not merely equal to a constant , but to that given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : banis ] ) taking @xmath84 .",
    "this gives @xmath85 , which not only satisfies the desired sharp - interface limit , but also ensures that the introduction of anisotropy will not result in any extra first - order correction to the free boundary problem , so that the above conditions on @xmath86 still hold .",
    "the same phase - field equations could be used for the circular geometry reinterpreting the parameters , since an analogue rescaling yields formally the same result .",
    "however , the boundary conditions would change .",
    "for instance , injection at the center of the cell should also be considered .",
    "anyhow , we choose to simulate the well controlled situation in which an ( unstable ) steady finger propagates in a channel of width @xmath33 .",
    "this representation is of course exact for single fingers in experiments carried out in the linear hele ",
    "shaw cell @xcite , but only a ( good ) approximation for the vicinity of a finger in a multifinger configuration ( with many fingers ) in the circular geometry @xcite .",
    "we investigate the transition between the tip - splitting and side - branching behaviors as both the dimensionless surface tension @xmath87 and its anisotropy @xmath88 are varied .",
    "we are interested mainly in the effect of the anisotropy coming from the viscosity ( @xmath88 ) , so we drop that in the original surface tension ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the runs use equal viscosities in both fluids , @xmath90 , for reasons of numerical efficiency ( @xmath91 ) , but we do not expect the viscosity contrast to affect the stability of the tip for similar reasons for which it does not play any role in the ( linear ) stability of a flat interface . to check this conjecture we ran simulations with @xmath92 both for @xmath90 and @xmath93 , two values of the viscosity contrast for which a dramatic change in the competition dynamics was seen using the same phase - field model @xcite , and we found that the transition lies in both cases between @xmath94 and @xmath95",
    ". these @xmath93 runs are indeed the ones shown in figs . 1 and 2",
    ".    we use @xmath96 , so that we can simulate accurately with values of the dimensionless surface tension down to @xmath97 .",
    "we first run a steady finger with a large , isotropic dimensionless surface tension @xmath98 , large enough for the finger not to destabilize for the amount of ( numerical ) noise we have and thus reach its steady width and velocity . once this is achieved see inner interface in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b) , we perform a `` quench '' in surface tension , i.e. , we instantly reduce it to some lower value . simultaneously , we also introduce some amount of anisotropy @xmath88 .    the subsequent interface evolution for @xmath92 ( and @xmath93 , @xmath99 )",

    "( simulations used only half of the channel and reflecting boundary conditions at its center @xmath101 ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath1 position of the interface at the center of the channel ( also in the frame of the mean interface ) is plotted against time in fig .",
    "2 .    for this value of @xmath87",
    "the finger clearly destabilizes : first its tip widens and flattens ( see fig . 1 ) and therefore slows down ( see fig .",
    "2 ) for any value of the anisotropy .",
    "( note that for @xmath102 the tip position would be a straight line in time , since the finger was steady , and , in particular , its velocity ) .",
    "then , for @xmath94 the tip continues to flatten and slow down until its curvature [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] and eventually its velocity in the frame of the mean interface ( lower curve in fig .",
    "2 ) reverse their signs . finally , the velocity of the interface at the center of the channel seems to reach some negative constant value ( again , in the frame moving with the mean interface ) corresponding to the growth of two parallel fingers at each side .",
    "we identify this reversal of the curvature sign at the center of the finger and this always convex tip position vs. time plot with the tip - splitting morphology .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath95 the reversal of the curvature sign takes place at some distance of the center of the channel , while at the center the curvature increases again [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] and makes it possible for the tip to speed up again as well , giving rise to a change of concavity in the tip position vs. time plot ( upper curve in fig .",
    "we identify this reversal of the curvature sign at a distance from the center of the channel and this change of concavity in the tip position vs. time plot with the side - branching morphology .    in this way we systematically explore values of the dimensionless surface tension @xmath87 ranging from @xmath103 down to @xmath104 . for each value of @xmath87",
    "we simulate with several values of the anisotropy @xmath88 , and we find that there is a relatively sharp transition between the tip - splitting and side - branching morphologies . in fig .",
    "3 we show for each value of @xmath87 ( @xmath0 axis ) the two closest values of @xmath88 ( @xmath1 axis ) for which the two different morphologies are observed , namely tip - splitting ( circles ) and side - branching ( triangles ) .",
    "thus we know that the transition line must lie somewhere between the circles and the triangles , and that above ( larger values of @xmath88 ) and left ( lower values of @xmath87 ) of that transition line the morphology is side - branching , and below and right of it , tip - splitting .",
    "this means that the critical anisotropy @xmath88 above which side - branching replaces tip - splitting decreases with decreasing dimensionless surface tension @xmath87 .",
    "in fact , this critical anisotropy vanishes at @xmath105 , and below this value only side - branching is observed , even if one uses negative anisotropies down to @xmath106 , which correspond to a viscosity larger in the direction of growth of the finger than in the perpendicular one , and which is not the case of the liquid crystal experiments that motivated this study .",
    "( @xmath107 to keep the two viscosities and therefore @xmath108 finite and positive ) . of course",
    ", the specific value of @xmath87 for which the critical anisotropy vanishes could be affected by the fact that a residual ( four - fold ) grid anisotropy remains , but it seems unavoidable that there is such a ( finite ) value of @xmath87 , since the transition line curves down as @xmath87 is decreased , and for large enough values of @xmath87 or the anisotropy @xmath88 the grid spacing @xmath109 is far too fine to affect the effective anisotropy .    on the other hand , for @xmath110 and for the time elapsed in our runs no clear side - branching is actually observed above the transition line extrapolated from lower values of @xmath87 , whereas tip - splitting still occurs below that line . for even larger values of @xmath87 , namely @xmath111 ,",
    "not even tip - splitting is observed again within the time elapsed , although the steady finger still destabilizes through the widening and flattening of its tip .",
    "finally , for @xmath112 the finger is completely stable for the amount of noise we have , as was pointed out before .",
    "we have shown that viscous fingering with two different viscosities in two perpendicular directions maps to the standard viscous fingering equations ( i.e. , for isotropic viscosity ) with an extra two - fold anisotropy in the surface tension , which is such that , together with the hypothesis of flow alignment of the director , leads to growth in the direction of maximal surface tension .",
    "we have simulated the resulting problem using a previously developed phase - field model @xcite , and we have found that there is a transition from the tip - splitting to the side - branching morphology as either the anisotropy in the surface tension is increased or the dimensionless surface tension is decreased . we now draw the connection with the liquid crystal experiments of ref . @xcite .",
    "the observed anisotropy dependence is consistent with the experimental finding that there is a transition from tip - splitting to side - branching and back to tip - splitting with temperature in the nematic phase , since close to the other phases the director alignment , and consequently the anisotropy , weaken @xcite .",
    "the transition is found to be also reentrant with injection pressure @xcite , which is explained there with the hypothesis that too low pressures do not achieve flow alignment , whereas too large ones break down the hele ",
    "shaw approximation because of the importance of inertial terms in the hydrodynamic equations , which then destroy the flow alignment again .",
    "this anisotropy dependence is also consistent with simulations of the boundary layer model @xcite and the full solidification problem @xcite , as well as with analytical approaches to solidification @xcite .    as for the dimensionless surface tension @xmath87 dependence ,",
    "one first needs to relate the values of @xmath87 used in the channel simulations to the experimental parameters in the circular geometry . to do this we consider a virtual channel whose walls",
    "are placed at half the distance between a finger and its nearest neighbors . the channel width @xmath33 is given by this distance between adjacent finger tips , whereas the effective injection velocity @xmath8 turns out to be the ratio between the injection pressure and @xmath113 , the mean distance between a tip and the injection point .",
    "then , the following dynamic picture of a typical experiment in the circular cell emerges : initially some fingers develop .",
    "if the anisotropy , @xmath88 , is strong enough , their tips are stable ( which corresponds to a point above the transition line in fig .",
    "3 , where the observed morphology is side - branching ) . as these fingers grow radially , @xmath33 increases as @xmath113 , whereas the effective driving force , @xmath114 , decreases as @xmath115 , so that the dimensionless surface tension @xmath87 they experience is found to decrease as @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the corresponding point in fig .",
    "3 moves to the left ( lower values of @xmath87 ) , and the side - branching behavior is preserved .",
    "in contrast , if the anisotropy @xmath88 is not strong enough , the tips split ( the corresponding point is below the transition line in fig .",
    "3 , where the observed morphology is tip - splitting ) . as a result",
    "the number of fingers increases , which then compensates for the growth of the distance between finger tips as @xmath113 in such a way that the effective dimensionless surface tension @xmath87 keeps roughly steady during the pattern development , so that the corresponding point in fig .",
    "3 basically does not move .",
    "thus the transition line is not crossed and the tip - splitting behavior is also preserved . in this case , we can estimate @xmath87 in the experiments to be of order @xmath116 , whereas @xmath54 is said to be around 2 at the transition @xcite .",
    "this is indeed very close to our transition point @xmath117 in fig . 3 , but it should be taken into account that the value of @xmath87 below which fingers destabilize is known to depend on the amount of noise present @xcite .",
    "accordingly , one expects the whole transition curve to be shifted to different values of @xmath87 for a different amount of noise .",
    "the latter , however , is uncontrolled both in the experiments and the simulations .    on the other hand",
    ", the dependence of the value of the anisotropy at the transition on the driving force has been seen in viscous fingering with an etched cell @xcite . however , we find the critical amount of anisotropy for side - branching to replace tip - splitting to vanish at a finite value of @xmath87 . below this value",
    "we only observe side - branching .    a more realistic model of viscous",
    "fingering in a liquid crystal should include a velocity dependent viscosity .",
    "in general the resulting nonlaplacian character of the problem could not be avoided , but in principle it would still be possible to simulate the dynamics by means of a phase - field model .",

    "<S> we show that a minimal model for viscous fingering with a nematic liquid crystal in which anisotropy is considered to enter through two different viscosities in two perpendicular directions can be mapped to a two - fold anisotropy in the surface tension . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically integrate the dynamics of the resulting problem with the phase - field approach to find and characterize a transition between tip - splitting and side - branching as a function of both anisotropy and dimensionless surface tension . </S>",
    "<S> this anisotropy dependence could explain the experimentally observed ( reentrant ) transition as temperature and applied pressure are varied . </S>",
    "<S> our observations are also consistent with previous experimental evidence in viscous fingering within an etched cell and simulations of solidification .    </S>",
