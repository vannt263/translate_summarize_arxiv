    "silicon carbide ( sic ) nanostructures have attracted much interest in the last years because they combine the excellent properties of sic bulk@xcite ( wide band gap , high thermal conductivity , high breakdown electric field , thermal stability , high electronic mobility , and others ) with quantum - size effects .",
    "this combination makes sic nanostructures interesting materials for nanotechnology applications and nanoscale engineering.@xcite    recently , increasing attention has been paid to the planar structures of sic .",
    "although silicon prefers @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 hybridization , sic nanoribons ( sicnrs ) have been successfully synthesized@xcite and first - principles calculations have shown that sic has a stable two - dimensional honeycomb structure , similar to graphene.@xcite in addition , recent _ ab initio _ studies revealed that the monolayer sic sheet is semiconducting with a band gap of about 2.55  ev,@xcite while armchair sicnrs are nonmagnetic semiconductors ( with a wide band gap for all widths),@xcite and zigzag sicnrs narrower 4  nm present half - metallic behavior without applied external electric field or chemical modifications.@xcite this feature makes narrow zigzag sicnrs promising candidates for spintronic applications .",
    "the great potential of the sic nanoribbons for future applications in spintronics stimulates detailed studies of the effects of impurities and defects in their electronic properties .",
    "in particular , sic nanoribbons doped with boron and nitrogen atoms is an important issue to be investigated , since b and n are common contaminants in sic bulk , acting as p- and n - type dopants , respectively .",
    "moreover , it is well known that substitutional boron and nitrogen impurities in zigzag graphene nanoribbons break the spin degeneracy of the transmittance channels , and transform metallic nanoribbons into semiconducting systems.@xcite    in this work we have performed a theoretical investigation , using _ ab initio _ calculations based on the density - functional theory , of substitutional boron and nitrogen impurities in armchair and zigzag sic nanoribbons .",
    "our results indicate that the boron and nitrogen atoms energetically prefer to be localized at the edges of both nanoribbons .",
    "however , while boron preferentially substitutes a silicon atom , nitrogen prefers to occupy a carbon site .",
    "in addition , we verify that substitutional b and n impurities do not affect the semiconducting character of the armchair sicnrs , although the spin degeneracy of the band structure is broken . on the other hand ,",
    "we observe different effects of these impurities on the half - metallic behavior of the zigzag sicnrs : the half - metallicity of the nanoribbons is maintained in the presence of substitutional b impurities , whereas zigzag sicnrs become metallic when doped with n atoms .",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations presented in this work were carried out within the framework of the density functional theory ( dft),@xcite using the siesta code.@xcite we employed the generalized gradient approximation as implemented by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( gga - pbe)@xcite for the exchange - correlation functional , and norm - conserving fully - separable pseudopotentials@xcite to treat the electron - ion interactions .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals were expanded in a linear combination of numerical pseudoatomic orbitals@xcite using a split - valence double - zeta basis set with polarization functions ( dzp).@xcite    we have considered hydrogen - passivated zigzag and armchair sicnrs with widths @xmath2 ( 4-zsicnr ) and @xmath3 ( 7-asicnr),@xcite respectively . the 4-zsicnr and 7-asicnr structures were modeled within the supercell approach with 40 and 54 atoms ( including hydrogen atoms ) in the unit cell , respectively . the structural models of 4-zsicnr and 7-asicnr , indicating the substitutional sites investigated ,",

    "a vacuum region of about 20   along the nonperiodic directions was employed to avoid interactions between two neighboring ribbons .",
    "all the atomic positions were relaxed during the geometry optimization until the hellman - feynman forces were below 0.01  ev /  .",
