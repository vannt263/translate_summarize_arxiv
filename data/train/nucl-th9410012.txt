    "the original attempt at bosonization of the nuclear many - fermion system was motivated by collective particle - hole modes in nuclei@xcite . since that time the interacting boson model @xcite ( ibm ) has been phenomenologically very successful in explaining low energy nuclear spectroscopy for heavy nuclei .",
    "the bosons in this model are thought to represent monopole ( j=0 ) , quadrupole ( j=2 ) , and sometimes hexadecapole ( j=4 ) correlated pairs of valence nucleons in the shell model .",
    "the ibm hamiltonian is hermitian , usually has at most two - boson interactions , and conserves boson number , reflecting the particle - particle , rather than particle - hole , nature of the underlying fermion pairs .",
    "while one can numerically diagonalize the general ibm hamiltonian , one of the strengths of ibm is the existence of algebraic limits corresponding to the subgroups su(3 ) , u(5 ) , or o(6 ) , with analytic expressions for excitation bands and transition strengths , which encompass an enormous amount of nuclear data .",
    "the microscopic reasons for the success of such a simple model are elusive .",
    "otsuka , arima , and iachello , along with talmi , have used a mapping of the shell model hamiltonian to the ibm hamiltonian @xcite based on the seniority model @xcite , but these attempts have not done well for well - deformed nuclei @xcite . for this reason",
    "we have revisited boson mappings to see if we can understand the success of the ibm starting from the shell model .",
    "we will begin by sketching out various historic approaches to boson mappings @xcite .",
    "we then specificially follow marumori @xcite and otsuka et al .",
    "@xcite ( oai ) in our mapping procedure which maps fermion states into boson states and construct boson operators that reproduce fermion matrix elements .",
    "we give the boson representation of the hamiltonian and review the result that , in the full boson fock space , it factorizes into a boson image , which is the same as the belyaev - zelevinskii hamiltonian @xcite  in fact in the full space all mappings yield the same results times a normalization operator which projects out the spurious states .",
    "however , since our goal is to understand the ibm , which only deals with a few of the enormous degrees of freedom of the shell model , we go on to discuss boson images in truncated spaces .",
    "this , we shall see , gives rigorous insight into the oai mapping and shows how to systematically extend it .",
    "the fundamental goal is to solve the many - fermion schrdinger equation @xmath0 and find transition matrix elements between eigenstates , @xmath1 . for fermion",
    "many - body ( shell - model ) basis states one often uses slater determinants , antisymmetrized products of single - fermion wavefunctions which we can write using fock creation operators : @xmath2 for @xmath3 fermions . for an even number of fermions",
    "one can instead construct states from products of fermion pairs , @xmath4 if the number of fermion is fixed at @xmath3 then @xmath5 runs from 1 to @xmath6 . as the fermion fock space may be so large as to make direct solution intractable ,",
    "the idea of a boson mapping is to replace the fermion operators with boson operators , _ using only a minimal number of boson degrees of freedom _ , that approximate the spectrum and transition matrix elements of the original fermion problem .",
    "there are two approaches to boson mappings which we now review .",
    "the first approach , epitomized in nuclear physics by belyaev and zelevinskii ( bz ) @xcite , is to map fermion operators to boson operators so as to preserve the original algebra . specifically , consider a space with @xmath7 single - fermion states ; @xmath8 signify fermion creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the set of all bilinear fermion operators , @xmath9 , form the lie algebra of @xmath10 , as embodied by the commutation relations @xmath11 = 0   \\\\",
    "% \\left [ a_i a_j , a^\\dagger_k a^\\dagger_l \\right ] = \\delta_{il } \\delta_{jk } + \\delta_{ik } a^\\dagger_l a_j + \\delta_{jl } a^\\dagger_k a_i - ( i \\leftrightarrow j )   \\\\ \\left [ a_i a_j , a_k^\\dagger a_l \\right ] = \\delta_{jk } a_i a_l - ( i \\leftrightarrow j )   \\\\ \\left [ a^\\dagger_i a_j , a^\\dagger_k a_l \\right ] = \\delta_{jk } a^\\dagger_i a_l -\\delta_{il } a^\\dagger_k a_j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at this point it is convenient to introduce collective fermion pair operators @xmath12 we always choose the @xmath13 matrices @xmath14 to be antisymmetric so as to preserve the underlying fermion statistics , thus eliminating the need later on to distinguish between ` ideal ' and ` physical ' bosons",
    ". we also assume the following normalization and completeness relations for the matrices : @xmath15 generic one- and two - body fermion operators we represent by @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 ; from such operators one can construct a fermion hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "now one has the following commutation relations : @xmath20 = \\left [ \\hat{a}^\\dagger_\\alpha , \\hat{a}^\\dagger_\\beta \\right ] = 0 ; \\label{commute1 } \\\\ \\left [ \\hat{a}_\\alpha , \\hat{a}^\\dagger_\\beta \\right ] = \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta } -2 \\sum_{ij } \\left ( { \\bf a}^\\dagger_\\beta { \\bf a}_\\alpha \\right ) _ { ij } a^\\dagger_i a_j ; \\\\ \\left [ \\hat{a}_\\alpha , \\hat{t } \\right ] = 2\\sum_\\beta { \\rm tr \\ , } \\left ( { \\bf a}_\\alpha { \\bf t } { \\bf a}^\\dagger_\\beta \\right ) \\hat{a}_\\beta \\\\ \\left [ \\hat{t}_1 , \\hat{t}_2 \\right ] = \\sum_{ij } \\left ( { \\bf t}_1{\\bf t}_2 -{\\bf t}_2{\\bf t}_1 \\right)_{ij } a^\\dagger_i a_j \\label{commutelast}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the method of belyaev and zelevinskii is to find boson images of the bifermion operators , @xmath21 where @xmath22 are boson creation and annihilation operators , @xmath23 = \\delta_{\\alpha \\beta}$ ] , with the coefficients @xmath24 chosen so that the images @xmath25 have the same commutation relations as in ( [ commute1])-([commutelast ] ) . because the algebra is exactly matched , if one builds boson states in exact analogy to the fermion states then the full boson fock space is not spanned and one does not have nonphysical or spurious states .    in the full boson fock space , that is",
    ", no truncation of the boson degrees of freedom , the image of one body operators is finite and given quite simply by @xmath26 . since in the full space any fermion hamiltonian can be written in terms of one - body operators , the boson image of a finite fermion hamiltonian will be finite in the full space . the states that one must use then are built from the boson representations of the fermion pairs given in ( [ bzpair ] ) which will not just be products of bosons but will include exchange terms .",
    "for example , for two bosons and using ( [ bzpair ] ) , @xmath27 these exchange terms are due to the antisymmetry .",
    "we shall take care of such exchange effects by introducing a norm operator in the boson space .    for _ truncated spaces _",
    ", however , blind application of the boson representations of the pair operators ( [ bzpair ] ) will produce states outside the truncated space .",
    "therefore , if these states are omitted , then the hamiltonian needs to be renormalized to account for these omissions , which in general leads to an infinite bz hamiltonian .",
    "marshalek @xcite points out that there exist mappings that are both finite and hermitian , but these in general require projection operators to eliminate spurious states",
    ". we will regain this result later on in this paper .",
    "a variant of belyaev - zelevinskii that also preserves commutation relations is the dyson mapping @xcite : @xmath28 the operators are then clearly finite ; on the other hand they are just as clearly non - hermitian . from a computational viewpoint",
    "non - hermiticity is only a minor barrier , but it is an obstacle to an understanding of the microscopic origin of hermitian ibm hamiltonians .",
    "furthermore , unless the truncated pairs constitute a subalgebra , under truncation , renormalization will produce an infinite expansion , although it may be possible that this expansion may be more convergent than the bz expansion .",
    "the second major approach , pioneered by marumori @xcite , is to map fermion states and construct boson representation operators that preserve matrix elements .",
    "the original work of marumori , however , focused on particle - hole excitations and so the number of pairs and consequently bosons were not fixed .",
    "however , this method can be applied to particle - particle pairs as well .",
    "marumori constructs the norm matrix @xmath29 and then the usui operator @xmath30 where bosons states are constructed in strict analogy to the fermion states , @xmath31 then the marumori expansion of any fermion operator is @xmath32 we shall show that , in the full space , these boson representation operators factor into a finite boson image times a norm operator .",
    "furthermore , the boson image of the hamiltonian is the same as the bz image , and hence , the two methods are equivalent in the full space .",
    "otsuka , arima , and iachello ( oai ) , along with talmi @xcite , investigated the microscopic origins of the interacting boson model through boson mappings .",
    "although they also mapped states , they differed from marumori in some key details .",
    "first of all , they built states built on a fixed number of particle - particle , not particle - hole , pairs .",
    "in addition , the space was truncated to include only one monopole ( @xmath33 ) and quadrupole ( @xmath34 ) pair .",
    "these states were orthogonalized based on seniority .",
    "that is , they constructed , for @xmath35 fermions , low - seniority basis states of @xmath36 and @xmath37 fermion pairs , @xmath38 , and then orthonormalized the states such that the zero - seniority state is mapped to itself , and states of higher seniority @xmath39 were orthogonalized against states of lower seniority , @xmath40 then oai calculated the matrix elements @xmath41 for @xmath42 and obtained the coefficients for their one plus two - boson hamiltonian .",
    "these coefficients have an implicit @xmath43-dependence ( and for large @xmath43 and arbitrary systems such matrix elements are not trivial to calculate , especially in analytic form ! ) and thus a many - body dependence . at first sight",
    "this is not entirely unreasonable as it is well known the ibm parameters change substantially as a function of the number of bosons , even within a major ` shell ' .",
    "nonetheless the oai mapping has three drawbacks .",
    "the first is that it is not clear how to systematically calculate many - body contributions beyond that contained in the oai prescription , whereas the method we shall describe is fully and rigorously systematic .",
    "the second is that the oai prescription can induce many - body effects where none are needed .",
    "this point will be illustrated in section [ approximages ] .",
    "thirdly , only the @xmath44 space is exactly mapped , but very deformed systems will involve large @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , for an axial rotor limit , the average number of d - bosons in the ground state band is 2/3 the total number of bosons .",
    "correcting this by also mapping matrix elements with @xmath46 will involve many - body terms .    as an alternative to oai ,",
    "skouras , van isacker , and nagarajan @xcite proposed a `` democratic '' mapping where the orthogonalization is based on eigenvectors of the norm matrix rather than seniority .    in what follows",
    "we present a unified state - mapping method and obtain four strong results .",
    "first we derive matrix elements of the fermion operators in the pair basis ( 2 ) .",
    "second , we give general expressions for fermion matrix elements via boson representations .",
    "third , we show how in several cases one can have exact , finite , and hermitian boson images of fermion operators .",
    "finally , we show how to extend the oai and democratic mappings in a systematic and rigorous fashion , and illustrate how the choice of orthogonalization can affect the many - body dependence of the boson images .",
    "the starting point of any state - mapping method is the calculation of matrix elements of fermion operators between states constructed from fermion pairs of the form ( [ statedefn ] ) , including the overlap : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and so on .",
    "these matrix elements are much more difficult to compute than the corresponding matrix elements between slater determinants .",
    "as we shall show , however , full and careful attention paid to the problem of calculation matrix elements can yield powerful results .",
    "silvestre - brac and piepenbring @xcite , laboriously using commutation relations , derived a wick theorem for fermion pairs .",
    "rowe , song and chen @xcite using ` vector coherent states ' ( we would say fermion - pair coherent states ) found matrix elements between pair - condensate wavefunctions , states of the form @xmath50 using a theorem by lang et al .",
    "@xcite , we have generalized the method of rowe , song and chen and recovered ( actually discovered independently ) the expressions of silvestre - brac and piepenbring .    to derive the generalized wick s theorem ,",
    "we use the following theorem ( its proof , which requires fermion coherent states and integration over grassmann variables , is found in appendix a of @xcite ) :    let @xmath51 be an operator of the form @xmath52 where each @xmath53 is of the form @xmath54.\\ ] ] again , the matrices @xmath55 , @xmath56 are antisymmetric ( @xmath57 is not , in general ) , and are of dimension @xmath58 .",
    "we introduce the @xmath59 matrix representation of @xmath51 in the basis of the single - particle fock operators @xmath60 . then",
    ": @xmath61 the conclusion of the theorem is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath51 : @xmath62    appropriate derivatives of ( [ vev ] ) bring down pair creation and annihilation operators , leading to the desired matrix elements .",
    "we do this in some detail for the overlap matrix elements @xmath63 for the states given in ( 2 ) ; then we simply give the results for matrix elements of one- and two - body operators which are found in the same way . if one begins with @xmath64 where @xmath65 are defined in ( 7 ) , then the overlap is @xmath66    in applying the theorem the matrix algebra is straightforward ; keeping only terms linear in @xmath67 etc .",

    "therefore , given any two states constructed from fermion pairs and the matrices representing those constituent pairs , the above formulas give exactly the overlap and the matrix element for one- and two - body operators . for a pair - condensate wavefunction , the matrix elements can be found quickly through recursion @xcite .    throughout this paper",

    "using the fact that @xmath135 , the number operator , we find the ` linked - cluster ' (  la kishimoto and tamura@xcite although with differences ) expansion of the representations to be of the form @xmath136 and similarly for @xmath137 . in the norm operator",
    "the @xmath138-body terms express the fact that the fermion - pair operators do not have exactly bosonic commutation relations , and act to enforce the pauli principle .    in the example of a single @xmath97-shell given in the previous section , using the coefficients ( [ w_coef ] ) and with the mapping @xmath139 , the purely @xmath140-boson part of the norm is @xmath141 which again yields the correct matrix elements",
    ".    the norm operator can be conveniently and compactly expressed in terms of bosons by using the fermion norm matrix ( [ diffu ] ) in terms of the fermion generating function ( [ vev_trace ] ) .",

    "<S> after a brief review of various mappings of fermion pairs to bosons , we rigorously derive a general approach . following the methods of marumori and otsuka , arima , and iachello , </S>",
    "<S> our approach begins with mapping states and constructs boson representations that preserve fermion matrix elements . in several cases these representations factor into finite , hermitian boson images times a projection or norm operator that embodies the pauli principle . </S>",
    "<S> we pay particular attention to truncated boson spaces , and describe general methods for constructing hermitian and approximately finite boson image hamiltonians , including effective operator theory to account for excluded states . </S>",
    "<S> this method is akin to that of otsuka , arima , and iachello introduced in connection with the interacting boson model , but is more rigorous , general , and systematic . </S>"
