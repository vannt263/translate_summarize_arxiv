    "natural deduction system is one of the main logical system which was introduced by gentzen @xcite to study the notion of proof .",
    "the full classical natural deduction system is well adapted for the human reasoning . by full we mean that all the connectives ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 ( for the absurdity ) are considered as primitive and they have their intuitionistic meaning . as usual ,",
    "the negation is defined by @xmath4 . considering",
    "this logic from the computer science of view is interesting because , by the curry - howard correspondence , formulas can be seen as types for the functional programming languages and correct programs can be extracted . by this correspondence",
    "the corresponding calculus is an extension of the @xmath5-calculus with product and co - product .    until very recently ( see the introduction of @xcite for a brief history ) , no proof of the strong normalization of the cut - elimination procedure was known for full logic . in @xcite , p. de groote gives a such proof for classical propositional natural deduction by using the cps - transformation .",
    "r. david and the first author give in @xcite a direct and syntactical proof of this result .",
    "r. matthes recently found another semantical proof of this result ( see @xcite ) .    in order to prove the strong normalization of classical propositional natural deduction , we introduce in @xcite a variant of the reducibility candidates , which was already present in @xcite .",
    "this method has been introduced by j.y .",
    "it consists in associating to each type @xmath6 a set of terms @xmath7 , such that every term is in the interpretation of its type ( this is called `` the adequation lemma '' ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "we obtain the shortest proof of this result .    in this paper",
    ", we define a semantics of realisability of classical propositional natural deduction inspired by @xcite and we estabilish a correctness theorem .",
    "the idea is to replace the set of strongly normalizing terms used in the proof presented in @xcite by a set having the properties necessary to keep the adequation lemma .",
    "this result allows to characterize the operational behaviour of terms having some particular types .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is an introduction to the typed system and the relative cut - elimination procedure . in section 3 , we define the semantics of realisability and we prove the correctness theorem . in section 4 , we give some applications of this result .",
