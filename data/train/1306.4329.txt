    "the past decade has seen a rapid increase in the number and quality of observations of transiting planet atmospheres . since the first observations of light transmitted charb02 and emitted charb05,deming05b by hot jupiters ,",
    "the realm of exoplanet characterization has expanded into a larger sample size of hot jupiters seager10 as well as into smaller planets .",
    "two benchmark smaller planets are the 22.4 @xmath5   warm neptune \" gj 436b butler04,gillon07 and the `` super - earth mass '' 6.5 @xmath5  gj 1214b charb09 .",
    "characterizing these atmospheres is a stepping stone towards one day characterizing the relatively thin atmospheres of rocky planets .",
    "in addition , results for nasa s _ kepler mission _ borucki10,borucki11,batalha13 have now shown that 2 - 3 @xmath6  planets , perhaps at the boundary between super - earths with thin outgassed atmospheres and sub - neptunes with accreted envelopes , appear to be an extremely common type of planet howard12,youdin11 .",
    "more recent work suggests that this planet size bin could be the _ most _ common size of planet around sun - like stars , at least on orbits less than 85 days fressin13 , and these planets are also common around m stars dressing13 .",
    "gj 1214b  is our nearby example of a 2 - 3 @xmath6  planet , and the question of ``",
    "what kind of planet is it ? ''",
    "is an incredibly interesting one .",
    "it is already known that this question can not be answered from its mass and radius alone . solutions that involve mixtures of rock / iron , water , and h / he gas range from models with a rock / iron core and h / he envelope , to those with massive amounts of water , no h / he , and a small rocky core rogers10 . nettelmann11 and",
    "valencia13 have suggested that water - rich models with a steam atmosphere and no h / he envelope are unlikely on cosmogonic grounds . in models with a h / he envelope , the water ( or water plus other volatiles ) mixing ratio in the envelope or in the core are extremely poorly constrained nettelmann11,valencia13 . as was suggested by millerricci09 and kempton10 ,",
    "probing the outer atmosphere of the low - mass low - density ( lmld ) planets can in principle constrain the composition of the gaseous envelope . this in turn helps to constrain the bulk composition of the planet .",
    "tremendous recent effort has gone into characterizing gj 1214b  in particular , since it is the lowest mass transiting planet with an atmosphere than can currently be characterized .",
    "bean10 were the first to obtain a transmission spectrum , which showed a transit radius that was essentially flat at red optical wavelengths .",
    "many additional observations from the ground bean11,carter11,croll11,crossfield11,demooij12,narita12,teske13,narita13 and from space desert11,berta12,fraine13 have for the most part confirmed this view of a relatively featureless spectrum .    the relatively flat spectrum from the blue to the mid infrared has been suggested as being due to either a high mean molecular weight ( @xmath7 ) atmosphere , which shrinks the scale height and transmission spectrum features millerricci09 , or due to some kind of gray atmospheric condensate , which would obscure molecular absorption features .",
    "the viability of equilibrium condensates was first briefly explored in kempton12 .",
    "the viability of non - equilibrium condensates ( such as created by the photolysis of methane and perhaps other molecules ) has also been investigated .",
    "howe12 explored a number of photochemical hazes as a way to flatten the model spectrum .",
    "more recently morley13 found that a range of viable equilibrium condensates , including kcl and zns , and methane - derived hazes , using output from kempton12 models , could readily flatten the planet s spectrum , even down to solar metallicity compositions . at this point",
    "it is still fair to say that the flat transmission spectrum is degenerate with regard to its explanation .",
    "the discovery and atmospheric characterization of additional lmld planets is one powerful way to break this degeneracy . in this paper",
    "we explore the phase space of lmld planets from @xmath8 @xmath5  as a function of atmospheric heavy element enrichment and planetary atmospheric temperatures .",
    "hotter versions of gj 1214b ( which has a maximum @xmath3@xmath9 k ) may be warm enough that carbon chemistry will be dominated by co , rather than ch@xmath10 .",
    "this will eliminate a pathway to haze formation and could allow molecular absorption features to be seen , if a haze is what currently obscures them in gj 1214b .    furthermore , with the aid of state of the art population synthesis planet formation models mordasini12a ,",
    "mordasini12b we also investigate the expected abundance of metals ( or  heavy elements \" ) in the atmospheres of these lmld planets , and explore how a wide range in the mass fraction of metals in the envelope and atmosphere ( @xmath11 ) will lead to changes in the transmission spectrum , as a function of planet mass .",
    "we show that a high @xmath11 , and corresponding high atmospheric mean molecular weight ( @xmath7 ) appears to be a natural outcome of the planet formation process of small planets .",
    "as planet masses increase beyond that of gj 436b , the predicted metal enrichment of the atmospheres decreases , thereby decreasing the mean molecular weight , which would also allow molecular absorption features to be better seen .",
    "the goal of the paper is to provide a pathway for current and future planetary characterization over a wide phase space of planetary temperature , mass , and envelope composition .",
    "while previous works , such as spiegel10 have investigated the structure and spectra of atmospheres in the neptune mass range , here we are interested in a wider mass range , with a strong focus on composition and diversity . as the sample size of characterized low - mass low - density planets grows we will be able to determine the roles ( if any ) of atmospheric clouds / hazes and high @xmath11 in making transmission spectra of lmld planets challenging .",
    "this is a diverse population .",
    "figure [ tempmass ] shows the range of planet masses vs.  planet equilibrium temperatures for transiting and radial velocity planets below 30 @xmath5 .",
    "we have computed models of the atmosphere of gj 1214b  and similar planets using a collection of model atmosphere methods that have been widely used to model the atmospheres of exoplanets , brown dwarfs , and solar system planets .",
    "the fully non - gray atmosphere code has been used to derive model pressure - temperature ( _ p  t _ ) profiles for the atmosphere of titan mckay89 , uranus mm99 , brown dwarfs marley96,burrows97,saumon08 , and irradiated exoplanets fortney05,fortney08a , cahoy10,morley13 .",
    "the radiative transfer methods are described in toon89 .",
    "we use the opacity database of freedman08 , the `` correlated - k '' method of opacity tabulation described in goody89 , the equilibrium chemical abundances tables of k.  lodders and collaborators lodders02,lodders06,lodders09 , and the solar system abundances of lodders03 .",
    "the code we use to model transmission spectra is fully described in hubbard01 , fortney10b , and shabram11 .",
    "in shabram11 the code was tested against the analytical relations of lecavelier08a .",
    "the transmission spectrum code uses wavelength - by - wavelength opacities from the freedman08 database . to showcase baseline models ,",
    "we have computed transmission spectra using the planet - wide average one - dimensional solar metallicity _ p ",
    "profile from kempton10 .",
    "we use this model , and also a version of it where the mixing ratio of h@xmath12o is increased to 0.4 , and a version where the water mixing ratio is 1.0 ( pure steam ) .",
    "these models are shown in figure [ full ] .    as already noted by several authors , the gj 1214b  model with a solar metallicity cloud - free atmosphere",
    "is ruled out .",
    "berta12 , fitting to the highest s / n ground - based and space - based observations , suggested that water mixing ratio greater than 0.4 best matched their _ hst _ spectrum and all other available data , and we plot such a model , along with a pure water ( steam ) model for comparison .",
    "additional observations since berta12 have not materially changed their constraints .",
    "the plot shows the effect of increasing values of @xmath7 , which we will discuss later in the paper .",
    "we wish to examine at what planetary temperatures ( and hence , at what level of incident flux ) pathways towards haze formation may be most likely . zahnle09b and kempton12 have shown that the photochemical destruction of ch@xmath10 in atmospheres just cooler than the hot jupiters ( @xmath13@xmath14 k or less ) can lead to the creation of higher order hydrocarbons , which may progress to the eventual formation of `` soot '' or `` haze '' particles that could obscure the atmosphere howe12,morley13 .",
    "such haze is seen in jupiter s atmosphere , particularly at the poles [ e.g.,][]rages99 .    we have calculated _ p  t _",
    "profiles for mature gj 1214b - like planets at a range of incident flux levels , from 0.3@xmath15 to 30@xmath15 that currently experienced by gj 1214b .",
    "these profiles utilize a metallicity that is 50@xmath15 solar and the gj 1214a parent star .",
    "these models are shown in , compared to the chemical equilibrium equal abundance curve of ch@xmath10 and co. atmospheres that are everywhere to the right of this curve would be expected to be co - dominated , with a relatively small ch@xmath10 mixing ratio .",
    "we extend the non - equilibrium chemistry calculations of kempton12 and morley13 here for versions of gj 1214b  at higher and lower incident fluxes .",
    "the models were run using 50@xmath15 solar metallicity and two values of the eddy diffusion coefficient , @xmath16 .",
    "our aim is to understand better at what incident flux level the atmospheric carbon chemistry changes from being ch@xmath10-dominated to co - dominated .",
    "as described in zahnle09b and morley13 , the photolysis of ch@xmath10 leads to the creation of c@xmath17h@xmath18 , higher order hydrocarbons , which are precursors to the creation of upper atmosphere aerosols , which may be described as `` hazes '' or  soots . \"",
    "since it has been demonstrated that such hazes can blanket the transmission spectrum howe12,morley13 it is important to understand the planetary temperature beyond which this regime is passed .",
    "figure [ c2h2 ] shows the mixing ratio of acetylene ( c@xmath12h@xmath12 ) , the simplest higher order hydrocarbon .",
    "we can examine its abundance as a function of @xmath3  as a proxy for the abundance of all higher order hydrocarbons .",
    "these calculations use two values of the eddy diffusion coefficient , @xmath16 , which parameterizes the vigor of vertical mixing .",
    "higher values of @xmath16 here lead to higher mixing ratios of ch@xmath10 transported from depth to the upper atmosphere , which can then be destroyed by uv flux .",
    "therefore any boundary in @xmath3  between potentially haze - poor and haze - rich models depends on the unknown @xmath16 value .    for the high @xmath19 @xmath20 s@xmath21 case",
    ", the warm versions of gj 1214b  show abundant acetylene up until the model with 10@xmath15 higher incident flux , beyond that boundary the acetylene abundance in the upper atmosphere drops off precipitously . for the lower @xmath22 @xmath20s@xmath21 case ,",
    "the boundary is at lower incident fluxes , between the 3@xmath15 and 10@xmath15 flux models . taken together , these models suggests a boundary in @xmath3  at @xmath4 k where the potential effects of a haze layer could wane .",
    "this echoes the results of zahnle09b , who suggested a boundary of 1200 k , based on isothermal _ p  t _ profiles .",
    "we therefore suggest that the hottest lmld planets may not posses haze layers that could blanket their transmission spectrum , although further work on these complex photochemical problems is needed .",
    "in particular , extremely metal - rich atmospheres may be ch@xmath10 poor even at low temperatures below 800 k moses12 .",
    "also a wider variety of parent stars could be considered , although planets around red dwarfs are the most amenable to characterization .",
    "the planet formation process is chaotic and complex , as planetesimals merge to become embryos , and then planets .",
    "the composition of the planets themselves can change as smaller objects are accreted before the gas and planetesimal disk is cleared away .",
    "our understanding of the accretion of planets is still developing , but we are at the point now where it is possible to directly compare models of planet formation to the distribution and composition of detected planets",
    ". what we are interested in is understanding what @xmath11 may be for gj 1214b , how this value may vary for other planets of similar mass , and how @xmath11 will vary as a function of planet mass .",
    "we have conducted population synthesis calculations to obtain theoretical predictions for the heavy element fraction in h / he envelopes .",
    "the population synthesis calculations are very similar to the ones presented in mordasini12b .",
    "the planets are synthesized using an upgraded version mordasini12a of the planet formation model originally presented in alibert04 .",
    "the model combines several simple , standard prescriptions for the growth of the solid core and the gaseous envelope pollack96 , the evolution of the protoplanetary disk lynden74,papaloizou99 , and disk migration lin86,paardekooper10 .",
    "the reader is referred to alibert05 and mordasini12a for details . here in particular",
    "we focus on the accretion of solid planetesimals by the protoplanetary atmosphere .    during each calculation of the formation of one synthetic planet",
    ", we simulate at every numerical timestep a collision between the protoplanet and a planetesimal of a given size .",
    "this is done using the core mass and envelope structure of the protoplanet at this moment in time .",
    "the collision is simulated with a semi - analytical model with a basic structure that is inspired by the work of podolak88 , but takes into account the results from studying the impact of sl9 with jupiter .",
    "this event illustrated both the importance of mechanical disruption for massive impactors [ e.g.,][]zahnle94 , boslough94 , and the lower efficiency of thermal ablation for such large bodies field95,svetsov95 .",
    "a short overview of the model is given in alibert05 , mordasini06 , and below .",
    "a more detailed description will be given in future work .    to obtain the distribution of where mass and energy is deposited into the envelope",
    ", we integrate the 3d trajectory of the impacting planetesimal under the actions of gravity ( in the two body approximation ) , gas drag , thermal ablation , and mechanical disruption ( flattening and fragmentation ) . the planetesimal is described by its position , velocity , mass , and radius .",
    "these quantities are evolved with a coupled set of differential equations . for the thermal ablation",
    ", we have developed a prescription for the heat transfer coefficient as a function of the flow regime .",
    "we solve the normal shock wave jump conditions as in chevalier94 to get the shock wave radiation .",
    "this controls the efficiency of thermal ablation during hypersonic flight in the denser parts of the atmosphere , which is the decisive regime for large impactors opik58,zahnle92 .    for the mechanical disruption",
    ", we use the `` pancake '' model zahnle92 , but couple it to a model for the growth of rayleigh - taylor instabilities that develop on the front side of the impactor that behaves approximately as a fluid at dynamic pressures that exceed significantly the impactor s tensile strength or self - gravity [ e.g.,][]roulston97,korycansky00 .",
    "the model was tested by comparing it to simulations of different impacts , namely of the lost city meteorite revelle79 , the tunguska event chyba93 , impacts of km sized impactors into venus zahnle92 , and most importantly , the sl9 collision with jupiter [ e.g.,][]zahnle94 , boslough94 .",
    "the calculation of the trajectories of the planetesimal yields the radial mass deposition profile .",
    "we thus know the fraction of the accreted solids that is deposited in the envelope while the rest reaches the core directly .",
    "this is done during the entire formation of the planet , giving at the end of a simulation the final core mass , the total mass deposited in the envelope , and the amount of gas h / he that was accreted .",
    "two populations of synthetic planets were calculated which only differ in the assumed size of the planetesimals .",
    "the size of the planetesimals is fixed during one synthesis and always equal to either 1 or 100 km .",
    "this is clearly an idealization , since in reality a size spectrum of different planetesimals will be accreted .",
    "the size spectrum will be a function of time and the distance from the star .",
    "if a protoplanet accretes beyond the iceline , the planetesimals are assumed to have an icy composition , otherwise they are made of rocks .",
    "this influences their density , tensile strength , heat of vaporization , and some other material parameters opik58 , podolak88 , boslough94 .",
    "the impact geometry is head - on .",
    "the initial velocity of the planetesimals relative to the planet is equal to the local escape speed , i.e. , we assume that the random velocities are small .    diversity in the formation conditions of the planets , which are manifest in the final envelope enrichment of the planets , comes from a variety of factors , as described in mordasini12a .",
    "these include diversity in : the dust to gas ratio in the protoplanetary disk , according to observed [ fe / h ] distributions in the solar neighborhood , the protoplanetary disk gas mass , according to observed disk mass distributions in rho ophiuchi , the external photoevaporation rate which sets together with viscous evolution the disk lifetimes , chosen in a way that the disks have a lifetime distribution similar as observed , and finally the initial position of the embryo , uniform in the logarithm of the semimajor axis .    for the resulting envelope enrichment",
    "we make a number of assumptions ( besides the general model assumptions , like no mass loss or accretion by the planets after the protoplanetary gas disk is gone , see mordasini et al .",
    "first we assume that the matter that is ablated during the passage of the planetesimal does not later on sink to the core .",
    "the actual fate of the solids will depend on the relative timescales of settling and mixing , which are controlled by the solubility of heavy elements in the h / he wilson12 and the state of the envelope ( radiative vs. convective layers ) .",
    "a sinking of a part of the solids initially deposited in the envelope would reduce the envelope metallicity .",
    "alternatively it is also possible that the solids initially ( during the formation phase ) settle deep into the envelope , but at a later stage get mixed homogeneously through the envelope iaroslavitz07 .",
    "second , we assume that the solid core ( formed by impactor material that can directly penetrate through the entire envelope ) does not subsequently dissolve [ see][]guillot04,wilson12 . this process would in contrast increase the envelope metallicity .    finally , we caution that the calculations are currently not self - consistent since our planetary structure code is not yet able to handle a compositionally varying equation of state and opacity . while we keep track of the amount of solids deposited in the envelope , we nevertheless add all solids to the ( computational ) core mass .",
    "this set - up corresponds to a similar simplification made in pollack96 .",
    "thus the formation and evolution of the planets is in fact the one of planets with all solids in the ( computational ) core and a pure h / he envelope which is modeled with the eos of scvh , and the solar composition opacities of bell97 and freedman08 .",
    "this must be critically kept in mind , since it has been shown hori11 that the enrichment of the envelope lowers the critical core masses and speeds up gas accretion [ see also][]stevenson82b .",
    "this means that the envelope composition feeds back onto the formation process .",
    "one should further note that compositional gradients can potentially have important implications also for the evolution of planets by inhibiting efficient , large - scale convection stevenson85 , leconte12 .",
    "we finally mention that the formation model , including the part used to simulate the impact , are strongly simplified descriptions of the actual processes .",
    "this means that the resulting envelope enrichments must be regarded as first , rough estimates .",
    "in particular the link between the initial deposition in the envelope , and the atmospheric enrichment after several gyrs of evolution needs to be explored .      in figure",
    "[ zenv ] , the blue dots show the envelope enrichment using 100 km planetesimals as a function of planet mass , while the red dots assume 1 km planetesimals . for 100 km",
    "planetesimals , and the lowest planetary masses ( less than a few earth masses ) , @xmath11 is typically relatively low .",
    "this is a consequence of the following : these very low mass planets can only accrete tenuous h / he envelopes since the gas accretion timescale nonlinearly increases for lower core mass [ e.g.,][]ikoma00 .",
    "the 100 km planetesimals can fly through these thin atmospheres without losing much mass , but instead deposit their entire mass directly in the core , leading to low enrichments . while this basic mechanism is plausible ( cf .",
    "the radar - dark `` shadows '' on venus indicating that the planet is  opaque \" to planetesimals smaller than a certain critical size , zahnle 1992 ) , this is not necessarily a realistic result : if there are additionally smaller planetesimals which contribute important amounts of solids , they would get destroyed already in the tenuous envelopes .",
    "this is indeed the case for the 1 km planetesimals . in the simulations with these smaller impactors ,",
    "the very low mass planets are found to have high primordial enrichments .",
    "for the 100 km planetesimals , @xmath11 then grows with mass to a local maximum of approximately 0.7 at a planet mass of @xmath07 @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the fact that these planets can accrete a sufficient amount of gas so that the planetesimals get efficiently destroyed in the envelope , but their gas envelope is still not very massive , leading to the high values . for even more massive planets",
    ", @xmath11 starts to decrease again , since now the mass of h / he that can be accreted increases .",
    "giant planets have low @xmath11 , as expected , because gas runaway accretion strongly dilutes the metals in the envelope .",
    "the results for the 1 km planetesimals are qualitatively similar , with the difference that the @xmath11 are usually higher , as expected .",
    "an important common feature of the two populations is that at all masses , there is a wide spread in possible @xmath11 .",
    "if this can be preserved and has an imprint on the atmospheric composition we can observe today , we expect to find a large compositional diversity , too .",
    "this diversity would overlay the general trend of a decreasing envelope enrichment with planet mass characterizing .",
    "a key question that one can examine from the population synthesis output is how @xmath11 changes with planet mass .",
    "clearly figure [ zenv ] shows a tremendous range of planetary properties . this is a clear example of the planetary diversity that should at a",
    "minimum be expected .",
    "the quantity of interest when trying to determine the suitability of a planet for characterization by transmission spectroscopy is a comparison of the area of the atmosphere s annulus to the cross - sectional area of the parent star . in figure",
    "[ temparea ] we examine this area ratio for all known transiting low mass planets .",
    "we have arbitrary used an atmospheric temperature equal to @xmath3  and a height of five scale heights to plot the ratio of the area of the atmosphere annulus to the stellar area .",
    "open circles use the @xmath7 of a solar mix of 2.35 , while filled circles use a simply estimated higher @xmath7 , as a function of mass , based on figure [ zenv ] .",
    "we can crudely estimate a mean @xmath23 as a function of planet mass , further assume it is uniform in the entire envelope , and then convert @xmath23 to @xmath7 .",
    "we do this by assuming that the heavy element component is water , to find the average @xmath7 as a function of planet mass .",
    "the value of @xmath7 for some planets reaches 7 , dramatically shrinking the scale height .",
    "the arrows show the shift for individual planets , which are labeled .",
    "the ratio for gj 1214b  falls by a factor of @xmath0  3.5 , although we note that it is still the most promising target .",
    "we note that the apparent magnitude of the parent star is also a particularly important factor in the suitability of characterizing particular planets .",
    "of course figure [ temparea ] is just one realization of the wide range of possible values for @xmath7 for these planets .",
    "we have taken the population synthesis output of figure [ zenv ] and binned the output to find the range of @xmath7 values for different planetary mass bins .",
    "figure [ histo ] shows our results .",
    "several trends are worth noting . for 100 km planetesimals ( in blue ) the lowest - mass bin ( 3 to 5 @xmath5 , upper left ) values of @xmath7 are close to solar , since these planetesimals readily pass through the envelope without ablating .",
    "only for the larger planetary mass bins does @xmath7 begin to increase , due to the greater likelihood of appreciable deposition of the heavy elements into the h / he envelope .",
    "for the 1 km planetesimals ( in red ) values of @xmath7 of @xmath010 are common from 3 to 20 @xmath5 , with a modest trend to lower @xmath7 for the highest mass bin . in nearly all cases and for nearly all envelopes ,",
    "the 1 km planetesimals dissolve into the h / he envelopes , enriching these envelopes .",
    "one should clearly expect a tremendous amount of diversity in @xmath7 for lmld planets , in particular below 15 @xmath5 .",
    "put another way , at this point there is no reason to expect that all planets with the mass of gj 1214b  should show a similar atmospheric metallicity enrichment .",
    "the size of accreted planetesimals , and their composition , could vary greatly based on planetary @xmath3 , stellar type , formation time , the mass and location of nearby planets , and other parameters .      within the solar system",
    "the planets uranus and neptune are the closest to lmld planets in log(mass ) . while it could be an overstatement to suggest that lmld planets are all smaller version of these planets , it is worthwhile to review our current understanding of the structure and atmospheres of these planets .",
    "a window into interior structure that is only available in the solar system is the gravity field of the planets , which yields constraints on planetary density as a function of radius .",
    "recently , nettelmann13 have investigated constraints on the interiors structure , including uncertainties in the gravity fields , shapes , and rotation rates of the planets .",
    "`` standard '' three - layer models were calculated , including a rock / metal core , a middle layer composed mostly of water , and an outer layer .",
    "the water mass fraction of the outer envelope ( @xmath24 ) of up to 0.7 are acceptable for neptune , and 0.2 for uranus .",
    "it is tempting to compare these numbers directly to the model productions of @xmath11 from the population synthesis models .",
    "however , this must be done with great care .",
    "such three layer models are likely artificial , and if the interior structure is more complex ( see  [ evap ] ) it is no longer clear what @xmath11 for these planets should be .",
    "one can also compare the molecular abundances in the atmosphere of uranus and neptune to the elemental abundances in the sun .",
    "since the planets are quite cold , most volatile elements are condensed into clouds far below the visible atmosphere .",
    "methane is only partly condensed , so it is possible to derive its abundance in the troposphere from infrared spectroscopy .",
    "data from baines95 , along with the revised solar abundances [ e.g.,][]lodders03 , suggest an enrichment of carbon of @xmath25 solar for neptune fletcher10 and similar number of @xmath26 solar for uranus .",
    "furthermore , the detection of co in the atmosphere of neptune , brought up from deeper layers by vertical mixing , suggests an even larger mixing ratio of water .",
    "past and current modeling work fegley94b , luszcz13 suggest that the atmospheric oxygen abundance of neptune could be as large as @xmath27 solar . assuming a @xmath7 for the heavy elements of 18 amu ( correct for water ) @xmath28 solar would lead to @xmath29 and @xmath30 solar is @xmath31 [ see , for instance figure 6 of][and our appendix]nettelmann11 .",
    "these very high values of @xmath32 in the h / he atmosphere of neptune are similar to what was found from the gravity fields of the planet [ @xmath32 values up to 0.7 are allowed][]nettelmann13 .",
    "this suggests that s it is reasonable for gj 1214b and lmld planets as a class to have a similar @xmath32 in their h / he envelopes , or perhaps even higher .",
    "there are several lines of observational evidence that h@xmath12 dominated exoplanet atmospheres are not stable against atmospheric evaporation .",
    "most prominent are the observations that hot jupiters lose atmospheric mass vidal03,linsky10,lecavelier10,lecavelier12 , as has been observed in the ultra - violet with the _ hubble space telescope_. a more subtle but emerging trend is the incident flux vs.  planet density plane , which shows a lack of lmld planets at high incident fluxes lopez12,lopez13 . at the time of the discovery of gj 1214b , it was clear that atmospheric evaporation could be important in shaping the planet that we see today charb09,rogers10,nettelmann11 .",
    "since it is likely that lmld planets lose mass , and that a high @xmath7 atmosphere could explain the gj 1214b  transmission observations , it is natural to wonder if _ differential _ mass loss can occur . if hydrogen is lost preferentially , the atmosphere could become enriched in heavy elements with time .",
    "however , we find that this is not possible for a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere . [ see , e.g.][for a review.]hunten73 .",

    "atmospheric evaporation can expose deeper atmospheric layers which could be enhanced in metals due to a composition gradient .",
    "is has long been suggested that uranus and neptune may feature a composition gradient , with the fluid planetary `` ice '' becoming gradually more abundant with depth [ e.g.][]hubbard91 .",
    "such interior structures with composition gradients may suppress convection and could lead to thermal evolution models that better match uranus s current @xmath13 , compared to the three - layer models in  [ unsec ] . whether or not there are well - defined layers , it is certainly true that the h / he mixing ratio decreases with depth in both planets .",

    "however , we can perform simpler calculations to yield plausibility to our suggestion of metal - rich atmospheres , in particular for the lower mass planets . in figure",

    "a model of an m5v star by @xcite was used for gj 1214 , and the error bars are spaced according to the modeled spectroscopic resolution of the 2 instrument modes .",
    "the systematic noise floor was set to 35 parts per million ( ppm ) for nirspec because this was recently achieved by @xcite using the new scanning mode of the g141 grism on _ hst _ wfc3 ( which uses a similar hgcdte detector ) . due to the relatively coarse nirspec spatial sampling below 3 @xmath7 m wavelength ,",
    "a similar scanning mode will have to be implemented on _ jwst _ to obtain a similarly low systematic noise value in the presence of known detector intrapixel response variations and observatory pointing errors .",
    "however , the slitless niriss spectrograph @xcite will sample the _ jwst _ point spread function much more finely and will likely provide low systematic errors at these wavelengths even without a scanning mode .",

    "we find that this behavior could be a generic feature of the atmospheres of these planets .",
    "our population synthesis models , as well as experience for uranus and neptune , show that large enhancements in metals may well be common for lmld planets .",
    "simulations presented here show values of @xmath11 , the metals mass fraction in the h / he envelope are commonly 0.6 to 0.9 .",
    "this will shrink atmospheric scale heights for planets in the 2 - 4 @xmath6  range .",

    "if lmld planets have @xmath11 composition gradients , as has been suggested for uranus , the gradual loss of the outer regions of the h / he atmosphere could lead to the excavation of atmosphere with progressively larger values of @xmath11 . we also find that increasing the atmospheric @xmath7 via the differential escape of hydrogen from heavy elements is unlikely due to extremely long diffusion times between h@xmath12 and heavier molecules .",

    "chemistry calculations will be especially important in understanding the thermal emission spectra of the planets , since dayside spectra will not suffer for high @xmath7 values diminishing the atmospheric signatures . if planetesimal accretion includes rocky objects that do not bring hydrogen ( as the ices do ) even higher metallicities are possible , if these rocky planetesimals also ablate within the atmosphere .",
    "we have shown that high atmospheric metallicities are a generic outcome of the mordasini et al",
    ".  formation models .",
    "it may be that across the range of lmld planets to warm neptune class objects like gj 436b , that exceptionally metal rich atmospheres are very common , and should be studied in much more detail [ e.g.,][]moses12 .",
    "atmospheric mass loss of h / he envelopes in the extreme metal - rich atmosphere regime should also be investigated .",
    "the cooling provided by abundant metals , in the form of molecules , atoms , and ions , should be quantified .",
    "the high atmospheric @xmath7 together with efficient radiative cooling , could decrease atmospheric mass loss relates below those observed and modeled for h / he dominated hot jupiter atmospheres .    with a much better understanding of planet formation and migration",

    "such work is now happening for gas giants konopacky13 .",
    "one could imagine a gradient in accreted planetesimals that depended on distance from the parent star .",
    "in addition , planets that formed in situ inside the snow line would accrete relatively volatile - deficient planetesimals , while those that formed beyond and migrated closer in would accrete a mix of volatile - rich and -poor planetesimals that changed with time .",
