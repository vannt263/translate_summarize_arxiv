    "now let us consider the fermion propagator taking functional derivatives of ( [ 14_1 ] ) on the fermion sources @xmath906 and @xmath398 .",

    "the equality @xmath949 takes place to all orders of perturbation theory due to the ward identity @xmath950 as follows from ( [ 14_6 ] ) in the limit of the photon momentum @xmath951",
    ".    why did we do all the above computations of divergent graphs   ,   and   ?",
    "let us rewrite our initial ( before renormalization ) qed lagrangian @xmath952 where @xmath953 , @xmath954 ( we use the symbol @xmath955 to stress that all the objects are not renormalized , or bare , as one usually says ) in terms of physical fields and parameters labelled by the symbol ph and additional terms @xmath956 : @xmath957 where @xmath958 , @xmath959 , @xmath960 , @xmath961 , @xmath962 and @xmath963 & & + ( z_m-1)m_{\\rm ph}\\bar \\psi_{\\rm ph}\\psi_{\\rm ph}+(z_1 - 1)e_{\\rm ph}\\bar \\psi_{\\rm ph}(\\lefteqn{a}{\\,/}_{\\rm ph})\\psi_{\\rm ph}. \\end{array } \\label{14_24}\\ ] ] the lagrangian @xmath956 contains so - called counter - terms . in the leading order we computed all the coefficients in front of the counter - terms .",
    "now when one computes some effect using the lagrangian ( [ 14_23 ] ) all uv divergences are cancelled out order by order in perturbation theory by contributions of the counter - terms .",
    "let us look in more detail at the relation for the coupling constant @xmath964 where @xmath965 is the dimension of the charge .",
    "as we discussed above , @xmath966 due to the ward identity , and @xmath967 note that @xmath968 is a function of the dimension regularization parameter @xmath519 , while @xmath969 does not depend on @xmath519 . from ( [ 14_25 ] ) , one gets the following equality for @xmath970 ( @xmath971 ) : @xmath972 taking the derivative @xmath973 on both sides of ( [ 14_26 ] ) , we get the following equation : @xmath974 the equation ( [ 14_27 ] ) is a particular example of the renormalization group equation , which we do not discuss in this brief lecture course .",
    "the function on the right - hand side of ( [ 14_27 ] ) is called the @xmath975-function .",
    "so , at the one - loop level the @xmath975-function in qed is given by the following formula : @xmath976 one should stress that the coefficient @xmath977 in qed is positive .",
    "the equation ( [ 14_27 ] ) can be easily solved : @xmath978 this is the running coupling constant .",
    "if one measures the constant @xmath112 at some scale @xmath979 , one gets values for the constant at other scales .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath980 being measured at very small scale ( small momentum transfer or large distance ) in thompson scattering increases with the scale growing and becomes @xmath981 at the @xmath800 mass .",
    "this fact was confirmed nicely in lep experiments .",
    "note that , in order to get @xmath982 , one should take into account the contribution of all sm charged particles to the photon vacuum polarization function @xmath983 .",
    "this means that the charged particle  antiparticle pairs screen the bare charge at small @xmath984 or at large distances .",
    "the qed running coupling constant is illustrated in fig.[alpha ] @xcite .",
    "note that in qcd the @xmath975-function is negative , leading to an antiscreening effect ; @xmath985 becomes smaller with increasing of the momentum scale ( momentum transfer ) or decreasing distances .",
    "this is a famous asymptotic freedom property in qcd . in qed",
    "the situation is the opposite .",
    "if the scale @xmath519 increases to very large values the well - known landau pole @xmath986 is approached where the perturbation picture in qed breaks down .",
    "one should note that in qed all terms in the four - dimensional lagrangian ( gauge - invariant operators ) have dimension four . as a result ,",
    "the coupling constant in qed is dimensionless .",
    "this is crucial to have renormalizable theory , where all uv divergences are cancelled to all orders with the help of a finite number of counter - terms .",
    "this is also the case in the sm .",
    "all terms of the sm lagrangian have dimension four and all the coupling constants are dimensionless .",
    "so , the sm is a renormalizable theory in the same manner as qed .",
    "naively , one may think that the ew higher - order corrections are not that important .",
    "the perturbation theory expansion parameters @xmath987 with @xmath988 and @xmath989 are very small .",
    "however , the experimental accuracies are so high in various cases that even one - loop ew corrections might not be sufficient .",
    "indeed , selected lists of measured parameters by lep1 , lep2 , sld and tevatron are given below : @xmath990 the most important higher - order corrections come from resummation of the large logarithms , @xmath991 , as we have seen with running @xmath112 ( 1/137 @xmath13 1/129 ) .",
    "the second class of large corrections comes from contributions of the order of @xmath992 , which originate from ew goldstone boson ( or longitudinal w / z polarization state ) couplings to the quarks of the third generation .",
    "the later corrections lead to the shifts in w- and z - boson masses coming from the diagram in fig .",
    "[ f14 ] .",
    "loop corrections lead to the fact that sm parameters , coupling constants and masses , are running parameters , and they are non - trivial functions of each other . a famous example is given in fig.[w - mass - top - mass ] @xcite showing the dependence of the w - boson mass as a function of the top - quark mass at different values of the higgs boson mass .",
    "one should recall that the top - quark mass has been determined indirectly from the analysis of loop corrections , it being @xmath993 which is remarkably close to today s precise measured value @xmath994 gev .",
    "the low higgs mass range was preferred by a similar analysis of the tevatron and lep data , as one can clearly see in fig.[w - mass - top - mass ] .",
    "a summary of comparisons of the ew precision measurements at lep1 , lep2 , sld and the tevatron and a global parameter fit is given in the well - known plot shown in fig.[ew - global - fit ] @xcite .",
    "the only one discrepancy on the level of 3@xmath995 is observed for @xmath996-pair forward  backward asymmetry .",
    "1 .   the sm is a renormalizable anomaly - free gauge quantum field theory with spontaneously broken ew symmetry .",
    "remarkable agreement with many experimental measurements is observed .",
    "all sm leptons , quarks , gauge bosons and , very probably , the higgs boson have been discovered .",
    "the sm predicts the structure of all interactions : fermion - gauge , gauge self - interactions , higgs - gauge , higgs - fermion and higgs self - interactions . as a result ,",
    "the sm allows us to compute various cross - sections , distributions and decay rates taking into account higher - order corrections .",
    "however , not yet all of the interactions were tested experimentally .",
    "parameters of the theory are not predicted by the theory itself but extracted from the measurements .",
    "the ew sm has 17 parameters and qcd has one more parameter fixed from experiments : * the gauge - higgs sector contains four parameters @xmath997 or in terms of best measured @xmath998 ; * six quark masses , three lepton masses ; * three mixing angles and one phase of the ckm matrix ( more parameters come from the neutrino mixing matrix , which we do not consider here ) ; * the qcd coupling constant @xmath999 .",
    "there are facts which can not be explained in the sm : * fermions have very much different masses ( @xmath1000 gev , @xmath1001 mev ) coming from the same mechanism ; * dark matter exists in the universe , and there are no dark - matter candidates in the sm ; * the ckm phase as a source of cp violation in the sm is too small to explain particle  antiparticle asymmetry in the universe ;",
    "* neutrino masses , mixing and oscillations can not be understood in the framework of the sm ew symmetry breaking mechanism ; * there is some tension in explaining the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "as is well known , the simplest higgs mechanism in the sm is not stable with respect to quantum corrections ( naturalness problem ) . in the sm",
    "there is no symmetry which protects a strong ( quadratic ) dependence of the higgs mass on a possible new scale .",
    "something is needed in addition to the sm to stabilize the mass parameter .",
    "in addition , the sm does not give answers to many questions , such as : * what is a generation ?",
    "why are there only three generations ? * how are quarks and leptons related to each other ? ; what is the nature of the quark  lepton analogy ? * what is responsible for gauge symmetries , why are charges quantized ? are there additional gauge symmetries ? * what is responsible for the formation of the higgs potential ? * to which accuracy is the cpt ( charge , parity , and time ) symmetry exact ?",
    "* why is gravity so weak compared to other interactions ?    in our lecture",
    "we focused mainly on the ew part of the sm and aspects of the field theory needed clarifying , and we did not discuss qcd physics , higgs boson physics , neutrino physics , flavour physics , problems of the sm models leading to bsm ( beyond the standard model ) scenarios and sequences for cosmology .",
    "these are the subjects of the lectures by z. trcsnyi , j.  ellis , b.  gavelo , z.  ligetti , c.  csaki and d.  gorbunov at the 2013 european school .",
