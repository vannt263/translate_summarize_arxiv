    "typically , thermal conductivities decrease when approaching the nm - scale@xcite , while the electrical conductivity is affected to a much lesser extent , thereby making nanostructured materials good candidates for thermoelectric devices .",
    "moreover , because of the larger surface / volume ratio , the impact of the thermal resistance at the interfaces between different materials becomes concomitantly of increasing importance in nanostructured materials .",
    "both effects combine in integrated circuits reaching the nm - scale , and hamper the dissipation of heat generated in the nm - long channel of the most advanced transistors@xcite , thus representing one of the main limits to the further increase of microprocessor operating frequency . achieving",
    "detailed atomistic understanding of thermal transport appears therefore as a crucial prerequisite to overcome such limitations .",
    "atomistic simulations can help to understand which physical parameters control the heat path when short length scale effects become important . in particular , molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations contain all the ingredients to implicitly simulate the collisions of phonons at the origin of the heat conduction .",

    "direct \" method@xcite , on the other hand , a steady - state heat current is established between a heat source and a heat sink , and the linear gradient of the temperature profile is used to extract the thermal conductivity , again according to the fourier s law . in a different , time - dependent approach , temperature transients",
    "can also be used to study the thermal response.@xcite recently,@xcite we have shown that when a simulated temperature pulse establishes a step - difference temperature profile in a material , the transient to the equilibrium temperature is exponential , making it easy to extract a typical decay time of the thermal pulse . using the heat equation",
    ", the thermal conductivity can be obtained from this decay time .",
    "the advantage of this method , which we called  approach - to - equilibrium molecular dynamics \" , or aemd , is that time transients occur faster , compared to both the attainment of a stationary regime of thermal conduction across a spatial gradient , as in the ",
    "direct \" method , and to the numerical convergence required for the green - kubo relation in the emd method .",
    "therefore , much larger system sizes can be studied with aemd , containing up to 4.5 millions atoms @xcite , and with length @xmath0 as long as 0.1 mm for a graphene two - dimensional supercell @xcite .",
    "studying large systems is important not only to push the limits of the md methods , but first and foremost because a pronounced length dependence of the thermal conductivity @xmath1 is observed in good thermal conductors like silicon .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to study the physical origin of this length dependence , and to verify how well the underlying physics is captured by the computer simulations . in the first part of the work ,",
    "we demonstrate that the length dependence in the time - transient model , embodied by the aemd , originates from the cut - off on the maximum phonon mean - free - path ( mfp ) , imposed by the finite supercell length . by choosing silicon as the reference material , described by the well - established edip interatomic potential,@xcite we compare",
    "the conductivity corresponding to a given supercell length , @xmath1 , as obtained by aemd , to that corresponding to a given maximum value ( @xmath2 ) of the phonon mfp distribution , @xmath3 , as obtained by another atomistic approach.@xcite the strong correlation between the two values allows to explain the evidence of a length dependence observed in the aemd simulations , in which no other sources of scattering besides the phonon - phonon terms are present .",
    "in the second part of the work , we propose an extrapolation of the @xmath1 curves , based on the above understanding ; this is necessary , since the matthiessen - like relation proposed by schelling et al .",
    "@xcite for the  direct \" method can not be physically justified in the context of aemd , in which no explicit boundaries could provide a length - dependent phonon scattering . by applying the new formula to the data obtained by different interatomic potentials for crystalline silicon , we highlight the ability of edip to quantitatively reproduce the experimental values of thermal conductivity .",
    "finally , we show that the good agreement of our results with the thermal conductivity values obtained by emd ( a method not subject to a length dependence , once the number of phonon modes , i. e. the number of atoms , is large enough ) , rules out the existence of 1d effects , which might originate from the extreme aspect ratio of our atomistic structures .",
    "the principle of the aemd method is to create and monitor a temperature transient , and use the decay time of the temperature difference to obtain the thermal conductivity of the system . in the present study , devoted to bulk systems ,",

    "the additional conclusion is therefore that the strongly elongated supercell used in the aemd method do not prevent to extract a correct bulk value of the thermal conductivity .",
    "finally , we also showed that aemd simulations using the edip potential could provide values of @xmath25 for silicon that are the closest to the experiment , besides such an agreement could not be justified by the anharmonicity of this potential , as quantified by the grneisen parameters .",

    "<S> the length dependence of the thermal conductivity over more than two decades is systematically studied for a range of materials , interatomic potentials and temperatures , by the atomistic approach - to - equilibrium molecular dynamics method ( aemd ) . by comparing the values of conductivity obtained for a given supercell length and maximum phonon mean - free - path ( mfp ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find that such values are strongly correlated , demonstrating that the aemd calculation with a supercell of finite length , actually probes the thermal conductivity corresponding to a maximum phonon mfp . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the less pronounced length dependence usually observed for poorer thermal conductors , such as amorphous silica , is physically justified by their shorter average phonon mfp . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare different analytical extrapolations of the conductivity to infinite length , and demonstrate that the frequently used matthiessen rule is not applicable in aemd . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative extrapolation more suitable for transient - time , finite - supercell simulations is derived . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation scheme can also be used to classify the quality of different interatomic potential models with respect to their capability of predicting the experimental thermal conductivity . </S>"
