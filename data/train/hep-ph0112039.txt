    "<S> we report on the possibility of observing higgs sector cp violation of the minimal supersymmetric standard model at a hadron machine . </S>",
    "<S> the cp phase dependent cross - sections for the @xmath0 associated production processes are given for the fermilab tevatron and cern lhc . </S>",
    "<S> substantial production cross - sections for channels of all three higgs bosons simultaneously are shown to be possible , giving a direct indication of the cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> the observability of the higgs signals are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the search for the higgs bosons , scalar particles from the electroweak symmetry breaking multiplet(s ) , in the standard model ( sm ) and beyond is a major goal of present and future colliders . </S>",
    "<S> one or more light higgs boson within relatively easy reach of the upgraded tevatron or cern lhc is particularly favorable to the most popular extension of the sm , namely the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is very important that we study all possible scenarios under the framework in careful details . here in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we make an effort in the direction focusing on the scenario with radiatively induced higgs sector cp violation@xcite .    in the recent years , </S>",
    "<S> the so - called cp violating mssm has became a subject of many phenomenological studies . </S>",
    "<S> a major part of the latter focus on higgs physics , especially with application to the lep machine at cern ( see , for example , ref.@xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> implications for a @xmath1 machine is quite well studied . in particular , ref.@xcite has pushed the analysis to the prospective next linear collider . nevertheless , after the closing of the lep machine and before another lepton machine is commissioned , we have no choice but to focus on the not as clean environment of the hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is the time for detailed careful studies of the topic at hadron machines . some steps in the direction have been taken . </S>",
    "<S> more notable ones include works on aspects of the production phase in refs.@xcite restricting to the gluon fusion mechanism@xcite , as well as analysis of the subsequent decays of the higgs bosons produced@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a complete analysis of the collider signature from production to decays with the inclusion of signal - background studies is of course the final goal . </S>",
    "<S> however , the topic is a complicated one , and may have to be taken one step at a time . </S>",
    "<S> the present letter reports the first step by the present authors in the direction . </S>",
    "<S> we aim here at presenting explicit production cross - sections for all the three neutral higgs bosons through the higgstrahlung processes from quark - quark collisions , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . the gluon fusion process is generally expected to have the largest cross - section but suffer from very large background@xcite . hence , other production channels may also prove to be useful in probing the cp violation in mssm higgs physics . </S>",
    "<S> it has been emphasized , in ref.@xcite for example , that due to the absence of an @xmath4 coupling , the simultaneous observation of all three @xmath5 channels will be a strong indication of scalar - pseudoscalar mixings , and hence higgs sector cp violation , in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> we want to emphasize that this would be a qualitative result , pretty much independent of the details of the exact cross - sections themselves and the explicit determination of which region of parameter space the model lives in . </S>",
    "<S> seeing all the three higgs channels basically says that the mssm without the higgs sector cp violation is not right . </S>",
    "<S> one can always go on to models with a richer higgs spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the cp violating scenario studied here would , however , preferred by many as the viable alternative . </S>",
    "<S> we present here production cross - sections of the processes at both the tevatron and lhc , as our first probe towards the possibility of signals for the cp violation at the two machines . </S>",
    "<S> the observability of such higgs signals is a deeply involved , but obviously very important , question . </S>",
    "<S> while a detailed quantitative study is beyond our present report , we will try our best to address the issues involved qualitatively , drawing lessons and comparison from related results in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we would particularly like to draw attention to some plausibly important aspects beyond what has been studied in the literature .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that cp violating phases in mssm are stringently constrained by their contribution to electric dipole moments ( edms ) . </S>",
    "<S> the topic has been studied extensively@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it suffices here to emphasize that the edm constraints can be by - passed , for instance , by effectively decoupling the sparticles of the first family and/or cancellations among the various contributions . </S>",
    "<S> such constraints are not explicitly imposed in the present study . </S>",
    "<S> the rationale being that the higgs sector cp violation involves flavor dependent parameters only of the third family and the complex phase combination @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this certainly leaves much room for getting around the edm constraints , by tuning the other parameters and phases for instance .    </S>",
    "<S> the tree - level higgs potential of the mssm conserves cp . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures that the three neutral higgs mass eigenstates can be divided into the cp - even @xmath7 and @xmath8 and cp - odd @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the 1-loop effective potential , however , may violate cp . </S>",
    "<S> when this happens , three higgs mass eigenstates with no definite cp parity would be resulted . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs bosons are denoted by @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ( in ascending order of mass ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the cp violation may be generated by complex phases residing in the @xmath13 term and the soft susy breaking parameters @xmath14 ( and @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these phases generate contributions to the off - diagonal block @xmath16 in neutral higgs mass - squared matrix @xmath17 mixing the scalar and pseudoscalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> these may be given approximately by@xcite @xmath18 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> here , we have only displayed the contributions from the top squarks ( @xmath20 ) which are dominant for small @xmath21@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sizeable scalar - pseudoscalar mixing is possible for large @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .    in our numerical higgs mass computation , </S>",
    "<S> we follow ref.@xcite and use the public code available at @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this involves one - loop effective potential with large two - loop non - logarithmic corrections induced by one - loop threshold effects on the top and bottom quark yukawa couplings included . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in regions of parameter space where all three higgs boson of masses are relatively close to each other , say all smaller than @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , the model would be close to the decoupling limit where the radiative cp effect on the higgs sector is known to be unimportant@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are also restricting to relatively small @xmath21 value , with demonstrated substantial scalar - pseudoscalar mixings . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , we take nonzero a common phase for @xmath14 and @xmath15 as the sole source of @xmath26 .    at the patron level , to the leading order ( lo ) , the cross - section for a @xmath0 associated production process is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 ,  @xmath32 for @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) ; while @xmath35 is the @xmath36 coupling renormalized to @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial point here is that the three higgs bosons mix through an  orthogonal \" matrix , leading to a sum rule for the @xmath35 couplings@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , [ sr ] c_1 ^ 2 + c_2 ^ 2 + c_3 ^ 2=1 . </S>",
    "<S> the sum rule is well appreciated among researchers on the subject . </S>",
    "<S> it guarantees that at least one of the three production cross - sections is not suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is much exploited in higgs discovery studies . </S>",
    "<S> the sum rule also suggests that all the three cross - sections can be simultaneously substantial for some particular set of the relevant susy parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the latter feature plays a central role in our present analysis . </S>",
    "<S> explicit presentations of the variations of the @xmath35 s , or @xmath36 couplings , for the cp violating case of interest here have been given in many of the earlier works@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we skip explicit numerical presentation here .    </S>",
    "<S> we convolute the admissible patron sub - process cross - section given above with the cteq4l patron distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> qcd corrections are known to give an enhancement of about 40% for the tevatron ( run ii ) and 30% for the lhc@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other susy corrections are generally small@xcite . in the latter reference , it is shown to be less than @xmath38 , being smaller for large squark / gluino masses . in the explicit plots given in the figures , we scaled the lo cross - sections calculated with the corresponding enhancement @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) factor , to give a better indication of the next - leading order ( nlo ) results . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath39 factor is taken simply to be @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the tevatron and lhc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this should be good enough for the present purpose . </S>",
    "<S> readers interested in further details on the tiny variations in the exact @xmath39 factor value along with the changes of the model parameters are referred to ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our results with two representative set of chosen input parameters . </S>",
    "<S> parameter set  a is chosen in accordance with the benchmark scenario ( cpx ) introduced in ref.@xcite aimed at maximizing the cp violating effects . </S>",
    "<S> the cpx scenario is as follows : @xmath43 added to which we fixed @xmath44 for set  a inputs . </S>",
    "<S> parameter set  b is similar , with little variations , namely @xmath45 the charged higgs mass is taken as the control parameter on the scale of the higgs masses . </S>",
    "<S> we show only results for two choices of the charged higgs mass , at @xmath46 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath46 gives @xmath47 mass very close to the known bound from lep . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25 case gives a relatively high mass scale value getting close to , while still staying away from , the decoupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the two choices roughly envelope the range of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the production cross - sections are plotted as a function of @xmath26 , which comes here from a common phase of @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> explicit plots of the masses are also given for easy cross - reference . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 and 2 are results for the tevatron , based on set  a and set  b inputs , respectively , while fig .  3 and 4 </S>",
    "<S> give the corresponding results for the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the figures do illustrate the existence of the exciting possibility we go after , namely , having substantial production cross - sections simultaneously for all the three @xmath0 channels . </S>",
    "<S> this should not come as a surprise . </S>",
    "<S> naively , the sum rule [ _ cf . _ eq.([sr ] ) ] suggests there might be a  democratic \" limit where the three channels share the overall coupling equally . </S>",
    "<S> in that situation , each @xmath48 would have a production cross - section at the same order of magnitude as that of the sm higgs of the same mass , only suppressed by a small factor . </S>",
    "<S> our results do indicate explicitly that the scenario could be more or less achieved for some optimal @xmath26 value .    </S>",
    "<S> let us also briefly comment on the basic features of the plots . </S>",
    "<S> the general features of the dependence of the masses and gauge couplings [ represented by the @xmath35 s in eq.([cs ] ) above ] of the three ( physical ) higgs bosons upon the cp phase @xmath26 through the stop mixing parameter @xmath49 have been studied by various groups ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) . in each of the top panels of figs . 1 - 4 , our explicitly illustrated higgs masses agree well with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> a particularly note - worthy aspect is that the ( one loop corrected ) @xmath47 mass increases with @xmath50 till reaching its maximum at @xmath51 , and drops with further increase in @xmath50 . here within each panel , the latter is tuned with @xmath52 . in the plot of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) , for example , @xmath47 mass is maximum at @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the large effect of the cp phase enhancing stop mixing here promotes scalar - pseudoscalar mixings , hence suppresses @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this , together with the @xmath47 mass enhancement , gives a minimum for the @xmath55 production cross - sections at @xmath56 , as shown in the plots right below [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) and 1(c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 for large @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 is then dominated by @xmath59 which flips sign . </S>",
    "<S> that is why we have a dip in the plot . ] </S>",
    "<S> the particle actually assumes the character of the pseudoscalar around this point . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is almost completely reversed for @xmath60 , which simply corresponds to the pseudoscalar at the vanishing @xmath26 limit . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath61 is not much affected by variation in @xmath26 except when it assumes the character of the pseudoscalar at the other cp conserving limit of @xmath62 . with larger mass splitting between @xmath63 and the lightest higgs @xmath47 as given by the second case in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 [ plots 1(d ) , 1(e ) , and 1(f ) ] , we are getting closer to the decoupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath47 then behaves like the sm higgs . </S>",
    "<S> it not much affected by @xmath26 variation , which now mainly describes mixing between the two heavier states . with the same set of inputs , </S>",
    "<S> the features in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  3 are more or less the same as in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 and 4 are results from a different input set of parameters ( set  b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the set of input parameters is not very different from the previous case though , as we are strongly confined by our special interest in large @xmath26 induced mass mixings . </S>",
    "<S> the point where @xmath55 cross - sections are strongly suppressed while @xmath64 cross - sections enhanced in fig .  2 ( _ cf . </S>",
    "<S> _ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) is now shifted to @xmath65 . in all the cases , </S>",
    "<S> roughly at the central values of @xmath26 between two of the dips of the three @xmath0 cross - section curves , one gets the solutions for substantial cross - sections for all three higgs channels simultaneously .    </S>",
    "<S> one of our major result is that in the most favorable situation , there is a chance that all three higgs boson could be simultaneously produced with around or above @xmath66 cross - sections at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> the mass region of interest to us is in fact happens to be just well covered by the machine . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the exciting possibility of seeing higgs sector cp violation , assuming mssm . at the lhc </S>",
    "<S> , the cross - sections could all go simultaneously to around or above @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the more or less optimal case correspond to results illustrated in the sets of left panels in the figures , with masses for all three @xmath48 below @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the sets of right panels in the figures , however , illustrate roughly the cases of limiting capacity . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60 and @xmath61 are a bit heavier . </S>",
    "<S> they are around @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> as we will discuss below , this might be really pushing the limit on signal observability . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is our opinion that a careful and detailed analysis is required to set the definite mass reach . </S>",
    "<S> the latter may get somewhat close to the situation illustrated in these panels . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially true in the case of lhc .    </S>",
    "<S> one certainly should not be too optimistic about the scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we put the question mark in the title of this letter because there are good reasons to be cautious . assuming that the mssm really falls into such a parameter space region where the three cp violating higgs boson </S>",
    "<S> can all be produced with substantial cross - sections at the tevatron or lhc , identifying the signals may be daunting task . in the spirit of our present analysis , one can claim that the cp violating higgs bosons are unambiguously observed only after we have successfully identified all the three @xmath48 s produced through their decays . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise , one may have to rely on details on cross - section measurements and further inputs from other possible susy signals ( if at all available ) to pin down the higgs signals as coming from cp violating mssm . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize again that identifying three higgs mass eigenstates produced through the @xmath69 channels in itself establishes higgs sector cp violation , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ assuming mssm . with anything less than that </S>",
    "<S> , it is going to be an extremely involved task to confirm that the higgs boson(s ) observed is / are more than generic mssm higgs boson(s ) .    observing  intermediate mass \" </S>",
    "<S> neutral higgs bosons are notoriously difficult ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the  </S>",
    "<S> gold - plated \" 4-lepton decay mode @xmath70@xcite has good branching ratio only for heavier higgs bosons , while the 2@xmath71 mode @xmath72 has steeply increasing background@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> associated productions , the presently considered @xmath73@xcite , @xmath74@xcite , or even @xmath75@xcite have been advocated as viable alternatives to the gluon fusion process to be the focus of higgs hunting exactly for that reason . </S>",
    "<S> a recent paper@xcite gives detailed discussions on the various associated production processes focusing on the effects of large stop mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the latter , while closer to our present study , is still limited to the cp - conserving mssm . </S>",
    "<S> this is also the case for most of the previous studies@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such studies , while of some use in giving a rough idea on the observability of the higgs signals under discussion , certainly can not take the place of the necessary specific studies , as along the line recently started by refs.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , results from the latter references are not enough to help us to reach any definite conclusion .    </S>",
    "<S> ref.@xcite in particular gives interesting results on partial branching fractions of the various decays for the three @xmath48 s separately . </S>",
    "<S> it is a big step in the direction . </S>",
    "<S> what is still missing though are signal versus background analyses . </S>",
    "<S> the reference gives no definite mass reach numbers for the @xmath48 s . </S>",
    "<S> one would like to have the definite reach of the hadron machines in terms of the mass control parameter ( _ i.e. _ charged higgs mass ) as a function of @xmath26 reflecting the range of simultaneous observability of all three higgs signals . </S>",
    "<S> this ambitious task is beyond the present short letter . </S>",
    "<S> mass reach numbers for mssm higgs bosons are not widely available , even for the general case without higgs sector cp violation </S>",
    "<S> . we can only present below discussions based on available information in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the discussion aims at giving some idea on what might be expected . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it may have some speculative element . </S>",
    "<S> we will quote some mass reach number for the sm , or sm - like lightest mssm , higgs . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers are of course _ not _ directly applicable to our scenario . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sm case is much better studied . </S>",
    "<S> we have pointed out above that the coupling sum rule [ _ cf . </S>",
    "<S> _ eq.([sr ] ) ] close to the  democratic \" limit suggests a scenario in which the three @xmath48 s kind of share equally the role of the sm higgs . </S>",
    "<S> each @xmath48 then behaves like  a third of \" the sm higgs at the same mass . </S>",
    "<S> if one take the latter statement seriously while assuming all the other susy particles are heavier , we have a situation where the sm higgs numbers do provide a useful guideline .    the case for </S>",
    "<S> the tevatron may be quite marginal but we consider it worth the effort to check it in details , focusing on both the @xmath76 and @xmath77 decays , or including even more decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> decay branching fraction results from ref.@xcite do confirm the @xmath76 as the dominating channels at least up to masses of @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> so why should we consider the @xmath77 and other channels ?    </S>",
    "<S> current searches planned for tevatron run ii actually concentrate on the @xmath73 associated production process with decays @xmath76@xcite for higgs mass in the lower intermediate range , taking the extra advantage that the leptonic decays of @xmath78 or @xmath79 can be used as triggers to suppress background . </S>",
    "<S> sm higgs is expected to be observable through the channel , however , only for mass up to @xmath80 or slightly above@xcite . for higgs mass in the upper intermediate range , @xmath81 , </S>",
    "<S> the planned focus is rather on production through gluon fusion with subsequent decay @xmath77@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reference claims that the mass reach for a sm like higgs , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath82 , would be up to @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath84 with @xmath76 has also been advocated as a discovery mode at tevatron@xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> a reason behind is the strong background for the @xmath85 signal . in our scenario , at least for masses of around or above @xmath46 , @xmath86 could be sizeable for all three higgs bosons@xcite . on the other hand , @xmath85 coupling(s ) would be suppressed for the heavier higgs states . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , we can not rely on the @xmath76 channels to see all the three @xmath48 s then . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , unlike the sm case , using gluon fusion does not help confirming the cp violating setting we are interested in here . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> a previous study on trilepton higgs signal@xcite is particularly relevant . </S>",
    "<S> we will very likely have to rely on the @xmath87 decay to identify at least one or two of the @xmath0 channels . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath88 , </S>",
    "<S> ref.@xcite claims a limiting @xmath89 reach for the sm higgs in mass range @xmath90 , with suggestions on further gains to be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a combined study of the @xmath73 production processes with decay channels and signal - background analyses specifically for the cp violating mssm scenario will have to take the trilepton signal as one of the major focus .    </S>",
    "<S> the situation looks much better at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> studies for sm - like higgs shown that , for the @xmath73 associated production under consideration , the @xmath76 channel should have reasonable efficiency in identifying the signal@xcite , at least in the lower intermediate mass range . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 would also be useful@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again , in the upper intermediate mass range , even for a sm - like higgs one will have to go back to @xmath77 ( or @xmath70 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we emphasize again that the @xmath91 couplings are very unlike to be simultaneously unsuppressed . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the @xmath87 type trilepton signals are definitely useful for probing the cp violating model . </S>",
    "<S> ref.@xcite claims a @xmath92 discovery reach for the mass range @xmath93 with @xmath94 for a sm higgs . </S>",
    "<S> one may naively expect the signal for each @xmath48 to be weaken by a third or so in the optimal case of  democratically shared \" couplings ( equal @xmath35 s ) . </S>",
    "<S> that sounds quite encouraging .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that , in general , possible decays of @xmath60 and @xmath61 through @xmath47 itself may compete with the @xmath86 channels and complicates analyses of the latter . however , in the region of parameter space of interest here , such decays are unlikely to be important and hence not taken into consideration here . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we should mention that decays into superparticles are likely to dominate if their masses put them within kinematic threshold of the higgs decays . </S>",
    "<S> this is very unlikely for the scenario we are interested in here , as one can easily see from the illustrative parameter input set  a and b given above , hence not discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> perhaps we should also mention a related production mechanism , the weak boson fusion channels ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) . similar to the associated productions , the processes exploit the @xmath95 couplings . </S>",
    "<S> it is advocated as a possible higgs discovery channel at lhc , and a useful tool to determine the cp nature of the higgs boson involved . from the present perspective </S>",
    "<S> , it will be interesting to explore the possibility of simultaneous observation of all three @xmath96 channels as a probe for the higgs sector cp violation .    in summary , we illustrate in this letter explicit results on the production cross - sections of the three @xmath0 channels at the tevatron and the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that a simultaneous observation of the three channels may be a possibility , though could be quite marginal at the tevatron . in the best scenario , </S>",
    "<S> mssm with radiative higgs sector cp violation could give rise to cross - sections of the order or above @xmath66 and @xmath67 , for the tevatron and the lhc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> detail signal - background analyses exploring various decay modes are called for . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we hope that the above discussions have convinced the readers that there are good reasons to be optimistic . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we point out that the @xmath97 decays are going to be useful . </S>",
    "<S> assuming mssm , the simultaneous observations of the three @xmath0 channels will confirm the radiative higgs sector cp violation scenario . </S>"
