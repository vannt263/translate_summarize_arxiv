    "<S> the adsorption of polydisperse ideal polymer chains is shown to be sensitive to the large @xmath0 tail of the distribution of chains . if and only if the number of chains decays more slowly than exponentially then there is an adsorption transition like that of monodisperse infinite chains . </S>",
    "<S> if the number decays exponentially the adsorption density diverges continuously at a temperature which is a function of the mean chain length . at low coverages , chains with repulsive monomer  monomer interactions </S>",
    "<S> show the same qualitative behaviour .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs : 36.20.-r , 67.70.+n , 36.20.cw    2 synthetic polymers are almost inevitably polydisperse . </S>",
    "<S> the polymer chains are not all of the same length , and so a polymer is not a single component but a mixture of chains of different lengths . </S>",
    "<S> however , almost all of the large number of theoretical studies of polymer adsorption have considered monodisperse polymer chains , where the chains are all of the same length . </S>",
    "<S> this is done to simplify matters and is a reasonable approximation when , as is often the case , the width of the distribution of lengths of polymer chain is small . </S>",
    "<S> here we study polymers in which there are polymer chains with a very wide range of lengths , paying particular attention to the longest polymers in the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> our motivation is not just the experimental fact that synthetic polymers are polydisperse yet are almost invariably treated within theory as being monodisperse . </S>",
    "<S> polydisperse polymers may , and we show that they do , exhibit behaviour which is qualitatively different from that of monodisperse polymers . </S>",
    "<S> we study a very highly idealised model of polymer adsorption : ideal chains adsorbing onto a wall due to a short - ranged attraction between the wall and the monomers . </S>",
    "<S> this problem has been extensively studied for monodisperse chains @xcite , but not as far as the author is aware for polydisperse chains .    </S>",
    "<S> the adsorption of an ideal chain is a textbook problem . </S>",
    "<S> it is highly idealised : almost invariably the density of polymer adsorbed onto a surface is too high for interactions between the polymer segments to be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has served well as a simple first model of adsorption of monodisperse polymer chains @xcite and we shall use it as such for polydisperse chains . </S>",
    "<S> there has been previous work within the scheutjens  fleer theory @xcite , on the adsorption of polydisperse polymer chains but not , as far as the author is aware , on ideal chains . </S>",
    "<S> roefs _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite did not consider the large @xmath0 tail of the distribution and so did not find the behaviour we will describe below . note that in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the ratio between the volume of the solution and the surface area of the wall was only of the order of the radius of gyration of the polymers . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast here we study a wall in contact with a bulk polymer solution so the ratio between the volume and surface area is infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by briefly reviewing the behaviour of monodisperse chains , with particular emphasis on the dependence of the adsorption on the length of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the chains are ideal and each consists of a linear chain of @xmath0 monomers of length @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the chains are at a non - zero number density @xmath2 in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk polymer solution is in contact with a wall . </S>",
    "<S> this wall attracts monomers via a short - ranged attraction ; the range is taken to be @xmath1 for simplicity . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of attraction is @xmath3 . having discussed monodisperse chains </S>",
    "<S> we then generalise the theory to describe an arbitrary polydisperse mixture of chains of differing lengths . </S>",
    "<S> we show that not all polydisperse mixtures behave in the same way : there are three qualitatively different behaviours possible . which behaviour a mixture exhibits depends on the large @xmath0 tail of the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this is also true of the cloud - point curve of polydisperse polymers , as was shown by olc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent work by the author on the bulk phase behaviour of polydisperse hard spheres @xcite has found a similar sensitivity to the tail of the distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> ideal chains do not interact with each other and so finite ideal chains are independent systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> they therefore can not exhibit a phase transition . for ideal chains </S>",
    "<S> there is only an adsorption transition in the limit that the number of monomers @xmath0 tends to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the transition temperature of infinite chains by @xmath4 . for finite chains </S>",
    "<S> there is only a steep increase in the adsorbed density near @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> most distribution functions for polydisperse mixtures tend to zero only at infinity ( e.g. , the schulz and distribution @xcite ) , which is to say that they contain an infinitesimal density of infinitely large chains . </S>",
    "<S> the question then arises : as there are infinitely long chains present is there a phase transition ?    below the adsorption temperature @xmath4 large chains , @xmath5 are adsorbed onto the wall . </S>",
    "<S> the chains form a layer of height @xmath6 which can be easily estimated using a scaling argument due to de gennes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we restrict ourself to the weak - adsorption regime @xcite where @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy of adsorption of a single ideal chain has two competing parts . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the entropy change when a polymer chain is confined to a layer of height @xmath6 , this scales as @xmath8 . we take boltzmann s constant to be equal to unity . </S>",
    "<S> the second is the energy change due to adsorption , this is @xmath9 times the fraction of monomers within the range of wall s attraction @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> so , the free energy of adsorption @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 the width @xmath6 of the layer at equilibrium is found by minimising @xmath11 @xmath13 which gives an adsorption free energy of @xmath14 an exact treatment of adsorbed ideal chains yields @xcite @xmath15 which is the dominant part of the free energy difference between a chain in the bulk and a chain with one end near the wall , when both @xmath0 and @xmath16 itself are much larger than unity but we are still in the weak - adsorption regime so @xmath17 is small . for large chains , the free energy difference @xmath11 between a chain adsorbed onto the wall and one in </S>",
    "<S> the bulk increases linearly with @xmath0 .        for monodisperse </S>",
    "<S> infinitely long chains then the adsorbed density is infinite below @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that for polydisperse chains this is also true if the integral of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rhoapolydef2 ] ) does not converge , which it does not whenever @xmath23 decays more slowly then exponentially with @xmath0 _ or _ it does decay exponentially like @xmath30 ( @xmath31 positive ) but @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> so , if the decay of @xmath23 is slower than exponential , e.g. , log - normal or power law , then polydisperse chains behave as infinitely long chains below @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> there is therefore an adsorption transition at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> if the decay of @xmath23 is faster than exponential then there are not enough of the infinitely long chains to cause a transition and @xmath20 increases sharply but does not diverge . an analogous dependence on @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> is found in the cloud - point curve of a polymer solution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there if the decay is slower than exponential , the cloud - point curve occurs at the same effective temperature as that for infinite polymers . as here a slower than exponential decay means that the density of infinitely long polymers is high enough to cause the polydisperse solution to behave as a solution of infinite monodisperse polymer . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity in behaviour between the cloud - point curve and the results presented here is due to the fact that the free energy which determines the partitioning of the polymer at the cloud - point curve is also linear in @xmath0 .      </S>",
    "<S> the divergence is also present for a distribution function @xmath23 which is an exponential times a power law , as the schulz distribution function is @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the behaviour is qualitatively unchanged if the exponential is multiplied by any function of @xmath0 which varies more slowly than exponentially , allowing the exponential dependence to dominate at large @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for different distribution functions found for linear polymers .    </S>",
    "<S> all the above is for ideal polymers . </S>",
    "<S> what about polymers with monomers which repel each other , the standard model of a polymer in a good solvent ? </S>",
    "<S> the free energy of adsorption of _ isolated _ polymer chains with monomers which repel each other again has a dominant linear term in @xmath0 although the dependence on @xmath39 is different @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an exact field - theory treatment yields for long chains with repulsive monomer  monomer interactions @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath4 is the adsorption temperature for interacting chains and again this is the part of the adsorption free energy which dominates when the free energy of adsorption is negative and has a magnitude much larger than unity . the exponent @xmath41 is estimated to be 0.59 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , @xmath11 is linear in @xmath0 as before and so isolated chains with repulsive monomer  monomer interactions behave in qualitatively the same way as ideal chains . </S>",
    "<S> the non - ideal chains must , however , be isolated , i.e. , so dilute even at the wall that the interaction between chains is negligible , for this result to hold . </S>",
    "<S> interactions between chains changes the free energy of adsorption and so the adsorption behaviour .      </S>",
    "<S> there is no transition but for not too small @xmath34 and @xmath17 , we see that the adsorbed density @xmath20 increases as @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this should be compared with the corresponding expression for monodisperse chains , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rhoamono ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in adsorbed density when the polymer is polydisperse is as fast as for monodisperse polymer of length @xmath43 , equal to the longest chains present in the polydisperse polymer . </S>",
    "<S> this is perhaps surprising , _ a priori _ we might have thought that the adsorbed density increases about as fast as monodisperse chains of length equal to the average length @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact polydisperse chains have a much higher adsorbed density than monodisperse chains with the same average length @xmath34 length . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , where the slope of the adsorbed density for polydisperse chains ( dashed curve ) as a function of the attraction energy over the thermal energy is very similar to that of monodisperse chains with the length @xmath43 ( dot - dashed curve ) and much larger than that of monodisperse chains with the average length @xmath34 ( solid curve ) .    </S>",
    "<S> physically , what is happening is that most of the adsorbed monomers are from the largest chains of the distribution . that most of the adsorbed monomers are from the longest chains can be seen if we recall that the contribution to the adsorbed density of chains @xmath20 from chains of length @xmath0 is given by the integrand of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pgdef ] ) . for a cutoff distribution below the @xmath36 of a non - cutoff distribution with the same @xmath34 , </S>",
    "<S> the integrand is an increasing function of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarise , polydisperse ideal polymer chains show three qualitatively different adsorption behaviours depending on the large @xmath0 tail of the distribution function @xmath23 : ( a ) @xmath23 decays more slowly than exponentially in the @xmath5 limit , then the mixture behaves like infinite monodisperse chains ; ( b ) @xmath23 decays exponentially in which case the adsorption density diverges continuously , and ( c ) either @xmath23 decays more rapidly than exponentially or is cutoff at some maximum chain length , in which case the mixture behaves like finite monodisperse chains .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have been able to classify polydisperse polymer solutions into three classes , depending on their adsorption behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the case of an exponentially decaying distribution of chain lengths is especially interesting as it behaves in a way which is qualitatively different from that of monodisperse chains . </S>",
    "<S> sharp distinctions between monodisperse and the different polydisperse distributions can only be drawn when there are infinite chains present . </S>",
    "<S> only then is a phase transition possible whose presence or absence can be used to assign unambiguously a distribution to one of the classes . however , at least when the polydisperse distribution function @xmath23 decays exponentially , even when the distribution is truncated beyond some finite value @xmath43 there is a remnant of the behaviour of the untruncated distribution . </S>",
    "<S> near the temperature @xmath36 where the adsorbed density of the untruncated distribution would diverge there is changeover in behaviour : above @xmath36 the shortest chains contribute most to the adsorbed density @xmath20 , below it the longest chains contribute most .    </S>",
