    "the worldline formalism has proved to be an efficient alternative to conventional second - quantized methods to compute quantum field theory amplitudes in the presence of external fields , such as ( non)abelian vector fields  @xcite and/or gravity  @xcite , by using suitable quantum - mechanical path integrals . within such formalism , spinning particle actions are helpful tools to describe the propagation of particles with spin .",
    "these models are obtained by implementing local supersymmetries on the worldline : the susy partners of the particle coordinates  upon quantization  introduce the spinorial degrees of freedom in the particle s hilbert space , whereas the gauge fields of local supersymmetries impose gupta - bleuler type of constraints on the wave function , that turn out to be equation of motion of the second - quantized field operators  @xcite . for free theories this method",
    "can be applied to particles of arbitrary spin  @xcite .",
    "particles with spin can as well be described in terms of purely bosonic worldline models that involve suitable matrix - valued potential .",
    "however , already for the simplest abelian case , they require to path order the exponential of the classical action sitting inside the path integral in order to guarantee gauge invariance and lorentz invariance  @xcite . spinning particle models , avoiding such complication ,",
    "render the computation of scattering amplitudes much simpler .",
    "a similar path can be undertaken when a coupling to nonabelian gauge fields is considered .",
    "in such a case color degrees of freedom need to be added to the particle s hilbert space .",
    "one possibility is of course to couple the particle coordinates to an algebra - valued potential , and path order the associated path integral to guarantee nonabelian gauge invariance .",
    "this method was used for example in @xcite to compute trace anomalies using quantum mechanical models .",
    "on the other hand one may as well reproduce the color degrees of freedom by the quantization of suitable ( commuting or anticommuting ) auxiliary variables @xcite . when used in a path integral they automatically implement the path ordering .",
    "however the quantization of such auxiliary variables yields the degrees of freedom of a reducible representation of the nonabelian gauge group .",
    "choosing the variables to be of the grassmann type , i.e. anticommuting , yields a finite dimensional representation of the color group . for this reason they were often preferred over the commuting ones",
    "nevertheless , the representation they create is reducible .",
    "for example , choosing the variables to be in the fundamental representation ( antifundamental for the complex conjugates ) one finds a space containing beyond the fundamental all of its possible antisymmetric tensor products .",
    "choosing instead bosonic variables to start with , again in the fundamental representation , one finds an infinite - dimensional representation that splits into all possible symmetric tensor products of the fundamental . in either case",
    "the total representation is reducible .",
    "of course , one could use auxiliary variables in any other arbitrarily chosen representation , and find in the corresponding hilbert space all possible antisymmetric or symmetric tensor products of the chosen representation .",
    "one way of projecting onto a chosen irreducible representation is to couple the above auxiliary variables to a @xmath0 worldline gauge field , with an additional chern - simons term , whose coupling constant is tuned to pick - out only the desired representation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0 gauge field has no dynamics in one dimension , and it acts just as a lagrange multiplier that imposes a constraint : it fixes the occupation number of the auxiliary variables to a given value .",
    "the latter is quantized quantum mechanically , and can be tuned by an appropriate chern - simons coupling . selecting the chern - simons coupling to pick up only the states with occupation number one , i.e. the single particle states in the fock space of the auxiliary variables , one keeps only the representation of the gauge group chosen for those auxiliary variables .",
    "modifying the value of the chern - simons coupling , one picks up the states with different occupation number , sitting in the antisymmetric ( for anticommuting variables ) or symmetric ( for commuting variables ) tensor products of the representation chosen for the single particle states . for definiteness",
    ", we will choose here the fundamental of the @xmath1 gauge group .",
    "in the following we review such a construction and apply it to study the one - loop effective action of bosonic ( spin 0 ) and fermionic ( spin @xmath2 ) fields coupled to an external nonabelian field : this is related to the computation of the corresponding worldline path integral on the circle .",
    "ideally , one would like to treat similarly the gluon itself in a first quantized way .",
    "dealing with its self - coupling is not straightforward , if one wishes to use a spinning particle model with @xmath3 supersymmetry .",
    "however a method of introducing the coupling in that model has been introduced in @xcite , and one might apply the projection described here for the color charges of that model as well .",
    "the description of a free relativistic scalar particle can be obtained by simply implementing the constraint @xmath4 .",
    "classically this simply amounts to the relativistic dispersion relation between energy and momentum .",
    "quantum - mechanically it must be interpreted as an operatorial equation , i.e. as a condition imposed on the particle quantum state , @xmath5 . from a path - integral view - point one describes the propagation of the relativistic scalar particle in terms of @xmath6}\\ ] ] with the phase - space action given by @xmath7 = \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\tau \\big [ p\\cdot \\dot x -\\frac{e}{2}(p^2+m^2)\\big]~.\\ ] ] the latter action is invariant under worldline diffeomorphisms and the einbein @xmath8 is the gauge field for such local symmetry , and it is necessary to divide out gauge equivalent configurations in the path integral .",
    "the algebraic equation of motion of the einbein implements the relativistic constraint .    in order to minimally couple the scalar particle to a ( non)abelian gauge field",
    "one replaces the conjugate momentum with the covariant momentum @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an algebra - valued potential .",
    "the generators @xmath11 are chosen in the representation that gives the non abelian charge of the scalar particle .",
    "for definiteness we choose @xmath1 as gauge group , and consider the fundamental representation .    by integrating out the momenta , and performing a wick rotation ,",
    "one obtains the configuration space action @xmath12 = \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\tau \\biggl ( \\frac{\\dot x^2}{2e } -ig \\dot x \\cdot a + \\frac{e m^2}{2}\\biggr)\\ ] ] and the associated path - integral reads @xmath13}\\ ] ] where a path - ordering prescription @xmath14 has been inserted to guarantee gauge - invariance .",
    "such ordering can be implemented by adding to the particle action some complex ( commuting or anticommuting ) auxiliary fields that sit in the ( anti)fundamental representation of the gauge group . hence @xmath15",
    "= \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\tau \\biggl [ \\frac{\\dot x^2}{2e }   + \\frac{e m^2}{2 } + \\bar c^\\alpha \\dot c_\\alpha - ig \\dot x^\\mu a^a_\\mu\\ , \\bar c^\\alpha ( t^a)_\\alpha{}^\\beta c_\\beta\\biggr]\\,,\\quad \\alpha=1,\\dots , n~.\\ ] ] upon canonical quantization , the auxiliary variables @xmath16 and @xmath17 become the creation and annihilation operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the related fock space contains tensor products of fundamental representation .",
    "one may represent such space in a coherent state basis @xmath20 , left eigenstates of the creation operators @xmath18 . on wave functions , @xmath18 act multiplicatively , whereas @xmath19 act as derivatives .",
    "indeed , for a generic state @xmath21 with wave function @xmath22 one has @xmath23 and the wave function @xmath24 can be written as a @xmath25-graded sum of fields @xmath26 where the term @xmath27 is a field that sits in an symmetrized or antisymmetrized tensor product of @xmath28 fundamental representations : the tensor is symmetric if the auxiliary variables are commuting , and it antisymmetric in the opposite case .",
    "the generic scalar field described by  ( [ eq : expansion ] ) thus is not , a priori , described by an irreducible representation of the gauge group .",
    "in fact the above sum is a finite sum if the auxiliary fields are anticommuting , whereas it is even an infinite sum if they are commuting .",
    "however , in both cases , one may impose a constraint @xmath29 in order to select only the field @xmath30 that has @xmath31 indices in the fundamental representation .",
    "for example , for a scalar field in the fundamental representation one fixes @xmath32 .",
    "the latter constraint can be implemented in the worldline path integral by coupling the auxiliary variables to a @xmath0 gauge field @xmath33 , with the addition of chern - simons term whose coupling is @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 = \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\tau \\big ( \\bar c^\\alpha ( \\partial_\\tau+ia)c_\\alpha -isa\\big)~.\\ ] ] the factor @xmath36 solves an ordering ambiguity : the @xmath33 equation of motion @xmath37 corresponds , by choosing a graded symmetric ordering , to the operatorial equation @xmath38 . here",
    "the ( upper ) lower sign refers to ( anti)commuting auxiliary fields .",
    "the way we are going to compute the path integral corresponds precisely to the ordering chosen above .",
    "this method was already employed in other worldline applications , such as for instance one - loop effective actions of abelian differential forms  @xcite , higher - spin fields  @xcite , and quantum @xmath39-forms  @xcite . in  @xcite we treated the case of colored scalar and spin @xmath2 particles with anticommuting auxiliary fields , and",
    "thus we dedicate the rest of the present manuscript to the case of commuting fields .",
    "equipped with the premises above , the one - loop qcd effective action generated by a colored scalar field coupled to a non - abelian gauge field , can be represented in terms of a colored scalar particle path integral defined on a circle @xmath40 = \\int_{s^1 } \\frac{dx d\\bar c d c de da}{\\rm vol~(gauge)}~e^{-s[x , c,\\bar c , e , a;a]}\\ ] ] where the action is given by @xmath41 = \\int_0 ^ 1d\\tau \\biggl [ \\frac{\\dot x^2}{2e }   + \\frac{e m^2}{2 } -ig \\dot x^\\mu a^a_\\mu\\ , \\bar c^\\alpha ( t^a)_\\alpha{}^\\beta c_\\beta+\\bar c^\\alpha ( \\partial_\\tau+ia)c_\\alpha -isa\\biggr ] \\label{eq : w - action}\\ ] ] that is invariant under local one - dimensional diffeomorphisms with gauge field @xmath42 , and local @xmath0 symmetry with gauge field @xmath43 .",
    "one may thus gauge fix @xmath44 , with @xmath45 being the conventional fock - schwinger time , and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being an angle that parametrizes nonequivalent wilson lines @xmath48 .",
    "finally , the particle coordinates are taken with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "as mentioned above , we consider commuting auxiliary variables  i.e .",
    "fields that parametrize symmetric products of fundamental representations .",
    "they are integrated on the circle with periodic boundary conditions , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "hence , @xmath40 = -\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{dt}{t}e^{-tm^2}\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi } e^{is\\theta}\\int_{pbc}dx\\int_{pbc}d\\bar c d c~e^{-s[x , c,\\bar c , 2 t , \\theta;a]}\\ ] ] and @xmath51 = \\int_0 ^ 1d\\tau \\biggl [ \\frac{\\dot x^2}{4 t }    -ig \\dot x^\\mu a^a_\\mu\\ , \\bar c^\\alpha ( t^a)_\\alpha{}^\\beta c_\\beta+\\bar c^\\alpha ( \\partial_\\tau+i\\theta)c_\\alpha\\biggr]\\ ] ] where the constant part @xmath52 has been factored out .",
    "notice that the coupling with the @xmath0 gauge field can be absorbed in the auxiliary fields by a field redefinition that implies a twist of the boundary conditions : @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    ". we will refer to the latter as  twisted boundary conditions \" ( tbc ) .",
    "therefore the above path integral involves an integral over nonequivalent tbc s that works as a projector on an irreducible representation of the gauge group : it generalizes the approach of  @xcite where a sum over angles was instead used .",
    "the expression above is the starting point to compute a closed formula for the one - loop scalar contribution to gluon amplitudes . for such purpose",
    "we write the background nonabelian field as a sum of @xmath31 external gluons , with momenta @xmath55 , polarizations @xmath56 , and gluon colors @xmath57 @xmath58 choosing the generators @xmath11 in the fundamental representation",
    ". one may thus extract the corresponding amplitude from the above path integral , by looking at terms linear in all the polarizations .",
    "this amounts to taking the path integral average of vertex operators @xmath59}\\prod_{l=1}^n v_{\\rm scal}[k_l,\\varepsilon_l , a_l]\\label{eq : g - amp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the  gluon vertex operator \" can be read off from the above action , and is given by @xmath60 = \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\tau~\\bar c(\\tau ) t^{a_l } c(\\tau)~e^{ik_l\\cdot x(\\tau ) + \\varepsilon_l\\cdot \\dot x(\\tau)}\\bigr|_{\\rm lin~\\varepsilon}\\ ] ] where only the linear term in @xmath61 must be retained . above the kinetic action",
    "reads @xmath62 = \\int_0 ^ 1d\\tau \\big ( \\frac{1}{4 t } \\dot x^2 + \\bar c^\\alpha \\dot c_\\alpha\\big)\\ ] ] and it involves a zero - mode in the periodic @xmath63 sector . in order to invert the kinetic operator we need to factor it out .",
    "one way to do it is to remove the average of the closed path @xmath64 and split @xmath65 , with @xmath66 being periodic with vanishing average .",
    "we thus have @xmath67 , and the free path integral normalization reads ( we give some more details in the  [ appa ] ) @xmath68 } = ( 4\\pi t)^{-d/2 } ( { \\rm det}_{tbc } ( \\partial_\\tau))^{-n}= ( 4\\pi t)^{-d/2 } \\left(2i\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2 } \\right)^{-n}\\ ] ] whereas the propagators are @xmath69 where @xmath70~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the amplitude  ( [ eq : g - amp ] ) thus reduces to @xmath71 where @xmath72 represent the ( unintegrated ) parts of the vertex operators involving auxiliary fields and coordinate fields respectively .",
    "the latter ( cfr .",
    "eq.([eq : v - scal ] ) ) is just the unintegrated vertex operator for scalar qed , and thus , from the last line of equation  ( [ eq : g - amp ] ) , one notices that  at the unintegrated level  the color part factores out . also , the subscript  m.l . @xmath73 \" it to remind that one has to retain only the multilinear terms in the all @xmath73 s .",
    "the momentum conservation dirac delta - function in the amplitude above is generated by the integral over the zero mode @xmath74 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of  ( [ eq : v - scal ] ) is the one that appears in the well known bern - kosower formula  @xcite for scalar qed , i.e. @xmath75 whereas the vacuum expectation value of the auxiliary fields part reads @xmath76 where the different lines correspond to terms with a different number of  two - cycles \" of auxiliary fields , and the subscript",
    " @xmath77 \" in a correlator indicates the absence of two - cycles therein . in each line the dots",
    "refers to the different ways of picking the indices inside the traces . with  two - cycles \" we refer to terms with two contractions among the same two pairs of fields , i.e. @xmath78 .  .",
    "] each of them comes with a term @xmath79 .",
    "in particular , for the two - gluon amplitude , one gets @xmath80 which is @xmath81-independent , and can be promptly integrated over @xmath47 to give the color factor @xmath82 for the representation given by a symmetric tensor product of @xmath28 fundamental representations of @xmath1 , i.e. the representation described by the young tableau @xmath83 by using the wilson loop variable @xmath84 , expression  ( [ eq : cab ] ) can be computed as a contour integral @xmath85 where the naive contour integral @xmath86 is the unit circle centered in the origin @xmath87 .",
    "however the latter integral may only have poles at the point @xmath88 , that sits on the contour @xmath89 , and thus the contour integral must be defined through a suitable regularization .",
    "in fact , as shown in the  [ appa ] , also the normalization factor for the path integral is obtained upon using a regularization , i.e. by shifting the angle of an infinitesimal negative imaginary part @xmath90 . applying the same regularization to the integral above corresponds to integrating the same function over a contour @xmath91 that is a circle slightly larger than one",
    ", so that the integral precisely picks the pole at @xmath88 .",
    "hence , @xmath92 is the color factor for a scalar particle in a representation described by a symmetric tensor product of @xmath28 fundamental representations of @xmath1   is the correct normalization for generators @xmath93 in the representation  ( [ eq : young ] ) , as it can also be derived directly from the well - known group theory identity @xmath94 , with @xmath95 being the quadratic casimir , @xmath96 the dimension of the group , and @xmath97 the dimension of the representation . ] .",
    "notice that for @xmath98 , i.e. for a colorless particle , the contour has no simple pole , and thus vanishes , whereas for @xmath32 it yields @xmath99 , which thus leads to the same result for the two - point function as found in  @xcite .",
    "this two - point function gives the scalar contribution to the gluon self - energy .",
    "let us explain it further .",
    "by using integration by parts in the @xmath81 integrals , and defining @xmath100 , the scalar contribution to the two - gluon amplitude in four dimensions reads @xmath101 where the dimensionally - extended form factor reads @xmath102 the previous integral is uv logarithmically divergent ( in @xmath103 ) , and contributes to the renormalization of the gauge coupling constant , and to the associated @xmath104 function .",
    "it can be computed using dimensional regularization , i.e. @xmath105 ( and @xmath106 scheme conventions ) to give @xmath107 where @xmath108 . in the uv limit",
    "@xmath109 the finite part of the previous expression reduces to @xmath110 furthermore , the tensor structure can be written in terms of the ( abelian part of the ) qcd lagrangian , if the gauge field is represented as the sum of two gluons @xmath111 . by rescaling the coupling constant in the gauge field one",
    "gets ( a similar rescaling takes place in @xmath112 above ) @xmath113 or @xmath114 hence , the renormalized two - point function can be obtained from @xmath115 ~\\frac{1}{2 } { \\rm tr}(f_{\\mu\\nu } f^{\\mu\\nu } ) ( k)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where a term @xmath116 was stripped off .",
    "the running coupling constant can be read off from the latter @xmath117^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which the @xmath104 function can be computed @xmath118",
    "the generalization of the results described above to a spin @xmath119 colored fermion , involves the ( local ) @xmath120 supersymmetrization of the worldline action  .",
    "this is achieved by adding fermionic coordinates @xmath121 , and a gravitino @xmath122 . the massless version of the action reads @xmath123= \\int_0 ^ 1d\\tau & \\biggl [ \\frac{1}{2e}(\\dot x^\\mu-\\chi\\psi^\\mu)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\psi_\\mu\\dot \\psi^\\mu + \\bar c^\\alpha ( \\partial_\\tau+ia)c_\\alpha -isa \\nonumber\\\\&-ig \\dot x^\\mu a^a_\\mu\\ , \\bar c^\\alpha ( t^a)_\\alpha{}^\\beta c_\\beta+\\frac{ie}{2}g \\psi^\\mu \\psi^\\nu f^a_{\\mu\\nu } \\bar c^\\alpha ( t_a)_\\alpha{}^\\beta c_\\beta\\biggr]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , as above , can be used on a circle path integral to compute the one - loop effective action .",
    "in order to do so one has to gauge - fix the worldline gauge fields , and divide out the volume of the gauge group .",
    "the gravitino @xmath122 is taken with antiperiodic boundary conditions and can be gauged - away completely . finally one can twist the auxiliary field to absorb the constant @xmath0 field , and write the nonabelian gauge field as a sum of gluons ( a mass term can be added as well ) .",
    "this allows to read off the gluon vertex operators , that in turn allow to compute gluon amplitudes as worldline path integral averages of such vertex operators .",
    "the computation of the two - gluon amplitudes proceeds in the very same way as for the scalar case .",
    "one gets @xmath124 where now @xmath125 with @xmath126 being the fermionic propagator . using dimensional regularization the previous integral reduces to ( up to irrelevant constants ) @xmath127 which in the uv limit gives @xmath128 , and the fermionic contribution to the beta function thus reads @xmath129 that reproduces well known results ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a colored relativistic particle action is used to compute the scalar contribution to the one - loop gluon effective action , and commuting auxiliary fields are used to implement the path ordering and to reproduce the desired representation for the scalar particle .",
    "the main result is a bern - kosower like master formula for scalar contribution to the one - loop @xmath31-gluon amplitude .",
    "the present manuscript complements an earlier publication where the case of anticommuting auxiliary fields was described .    within this framework",
    "a natural extension concerns the worldline representation of the scalar propagator  dressed \" with external gluons .",
    "such dressed propagator describes the sum of all tree - level diagrams with one incoming and one outgoing scalar particle , and an arbitrary number of gluons , and it is related to the above particle path integral defined on a line , i.e. taken with fixed ( dirichlet ) initial and final boundary conditions , both for the coordinates and for the auxiliary variables .",
    "this last condition is necessary in order to assign color states to the scalar particles .",
    "although such computation should be relatively straightforward , the description of the colored particle with dirichlet boundary conditions surely deserves a deeper investigation , and we leave it for future studies .",

    "<S> it is known that the color degrees of freedom introduced this way form a reducible representation of the gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a method of projecting onto the fundamental representation ( or any other chosen irrep , if desired ) of the gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> previously , we have discussed the case of anticommuting auxiliary variables . </S>",
    "<S> choosing them to be in the fundamental representation allows to obtain , without any extra effort , also the situation in which the color is given by any _ </S>",
