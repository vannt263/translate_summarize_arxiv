    "understanding when and how the universe re - ionized is fundamental to our understanding of how galaxies and large scale structure form and evolve and is sensitive to global cosmological parameters . in particular ,",
    "the _ fraction of neutral hydrogen _",
    ", @xmath8 , in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is closely tied to early galaxy formation because it is related to the gas accretion rate onto galaxies . from current measurements",
    "it is still unclear when re - ionization occurred and what the sources of re - ionizing radiation are .",
    "the best of such current measurements come from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiments and high - redshift quasar studies , with additional constraints from lyman break ( lbg ) and ly@xmath0 emitting ( lae ) galaxy studies .",
    "wmap @xcite and planck @xcite place a @xmath9 constraint on when re - ionization occurred , based on the optical depth to the cmb due to thompson scattering of electrons .",
    "these data are usually fit by a quick re - ionization at @xmath10 , but are also fully consistent with a more gradual re - ionization with a tail ending at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "direct measurements of the optical depth from quasars indicate that the universe is neutral up to @xmath12 , based on the highest redshift quasars known today @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum measurements of lbgs between @xmath13 @xcite suggest that galaxies have a difficult time re - ionizing the universe until later times unless the luminosity function is unusually steep at the faint end , or the continuum escape fraction is high @xcite .",
    "the fraction of strong ly@xmath0 emitters within lbg samples should give us a more direct , complementary , and unique measurement of @xmath8 and therefore how quickly and when the universe is re - ionizing .",
    "fundamentally , ly@xmath0 photons are scattered in areas where the igm contains more neutral hydrogen , so the escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons is proportional to the volume of re - ionized hydrogen around the young galaxies .",
    "hence the fraction of galaxies with strong ly@xmath0 emission is related to the neutral fraction of the igm @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to note that this probe is also sensitive to the evolution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) inside galaxies ( like dust , see @xcite ) , so one must understand the effects of galaxy evolution to probe the igm .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission of lbg galaxies ( selected using broad bands ) is indicative of re - ionization ending at @xmath11 and a neutral hydrogen fraction of @xmath14% at @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in particular the fraction of strong ly@xmath0 emitters in lbg samples is found to rapidly drop beyond @xmath16 over a range of @xmath17 , a timescale of only @xmath18 myrs @xcite .",
    "an alternative to lbg selection is the use of narrow - band ( nb ) filters to directly detect laes at specific redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this method allows one to directly map the ly@xmath0 lfs as a function of redshift , which can then be compared to the lbg uv continuum lfs to estimate the neutral igm fraction .",
    "an overall change in the ly@xmath0 lfs between @xmath19 has been firmly established by large samples of spectroscopically confirmed laes @xcite .",
    "but the source of this change could be either an evolution in the igm or a change in the internal ism of the galaxies .",
    "the evolution of the ly@xmath0 lf based on laes beyond @xmath20 is far less clear .",
    "apart from a few spectroscopically confirmed laes at @xmath15 ( one spectroscopically confirmed out of two at @xmath21 @xcite and one spectroscopically confirmed out of three at @xmath22 @xcite ) , there are no confirmed laes at higher redshifts . a total sample of @xmath23 candidate laes at @xmath24 is known @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite favor a non - evolution of the ly@xmath0 lf between @xmath3 ( see also @xcite ) , which is in tension with other narrow band searches for laes at @xmath25 that only place limits on the number counts of laes @xcite .",
    "the reason for this tensions may be low - redshift interlopers and false detections in the lae samples . at @xmath26 ,",
    "both of these are estimated to contribute less than 1020% ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , at higher redshifts , these contribution are not known , yet , but are probably much higher ( see @xcite and this work ) .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observations of high redshift candidate laes are therefore necessary to resolve the tensions between the lae and lbg results at @xmath20 and to constrain the process of re - ionization at higher redshifts .    in this work ,",
    "@xmath27 , and h@xmath28 km s@xmath29 mpc@xmath29 . ] , we present keck - i mosfire spectroscopic follow - up of two @xmath30 lae candidates ( @xmath31 ) originally found by @xcite .",
    "we then go on to compare these results to existing data at lower redshift ( @xmath32 ) and to an empirical model derived from the lbg uv continuum lf and observed equivalent width distribution ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this allows us to place limits on the neutral fraction of the igm at @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and enables us to predict the lae lf at @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the two targets of our study are among the brightest lae candidates at @xmath30 ( 12.1 and 8.6 @xmath38 10@xmath39 erg / s/@xmath40 , respectively , measured in unb filters assuming negligible continuum ) .",
    "these targets were initially selected and published by @xcite and throughout this work we refer to these as lae1 ( brightest ) and lae2 ( second brightest ) , respectively . both laes were detected with an ultra narrow band ( unb ) filter in the cosmos field @xcite using newfirm @xcite .",
    "details of the data reduction and selection are given in @xcite , but we give a brief summary of their results here .",
    "the effective surface area of the unb survey is @xmath41 760 arcmin@xmath42 .",
    "the unb filter used for these candidates is centered at a wavelength of 1.056@xmath43 m and has a width of @xmath44 .",
    "this is a dark region of the spectra between bright night sky lines , and selects objects with ly@xmath0 emission at a redshift @xmath30 .",
    "the unb data were acquired over a course of a year in three different sets of observations ( february 2008 , february & march 2009 ) .",
    "this means transient objects with periods of @xmath45 year were rejected ( see @xcite and later in this section ) .",
    "the total usable observations add up to @xmath41100 hours distributed over 32 nights , resulting in a limiting magnitude ( defined as the 50% completeness limit ) of 22.4 ab in the unb filter .",
    "the area used to select these objects is covered by a second unb filter centered at 1.063@xmath43 m with the same width as well as deep ground based broad - band data from subaru in the optical ( g , b , v , r , i , z ) and ukirt and vista in the nir ( y , j , h , k ) .",
    "this allows one to exclude continuum on the blue and red side of the potential ly@xmath0 emission line and should have eliminated low - z interlopers .",
    "both of the candidates are not detected in any of the broad band filters as well as the second unb filter .",
    "this results in rest - frame equivalent width lower limits of @xmath46 and @xmath47 for lae1 and lae2 , respectively .",
    "we observed the two lae candidates ( @xmath0 = 10@xmath4800@xmath4946@xmath50.94 , @xmath51 = + 02@xmath520848.84and @xmath0 = 10@xmath4800@xmath4920@xmath50.52 , @xmath51 = + 02@xmath521850.04 ) with the mosfire @xcite spectrograph on the keck - i telescope on the nights of january 15 & 16 , 2013 .",
    "each candidate was observed with a separate mask created using the mosfire automatic gui - based mask application ( magma , version 1.1 ) and aligned using bright 2mass stars .",
    "the conditions were photometric on both nights , with an average seeing around @xmath53 .",
    "the observations were carried out in @xmath54-band ( @xmath55 ) using the yj grating and a @xmath56 slit width resulting in a resolution @xmath57 .",
    "we used 180s exposures with 16 multiple correlated double samples .",
    "the telescope was nodded by @xmath58 with respect to the mask center position between exposures .",
    "the total integration times were @xmath59 for lae1 and @xmath60 for lae2 , respectively .    before creating the mask",
    ", we verified that the 2mass , cosmos , and newfirm astrometric systems agreed to within measurable errors ( @xmath61 ) . during the observations we make sure that the masks were properly aligned by using either alignment stars and/or bright filler targets .",
    "in addition several bright sources with known fluxes and morphologies from the zcosmos - bright spectroscopic survey @xcite were placed on the mask to verify slit losses ( estimated to be 40 - 50% ) .",
    "we observed 12 and 4 of these galaxies in the lae1 and lae2 masks , respectively .",
    "the comparison of the expected spatial position from magma to the final spatial position on the reduced 2d spectra indicates that the alignment was better than @xmath62 during the observations .",
    "we used the public mosfire python data reduction pipeline for sky subtraction , wavelength calibration , and co - addition of the single exposures .",
    "the pipeline performs an a ",
    "b / b  a subtraction and co - adds the single exposures using a sigma - clipped noise weighted mean after shifting them to a common pixel frame and masking bad pixels . the atmospheric oh sky lines are used for wavelength calibration .",
    "the final 2d spectra have a spatial resolution of 0.18@xmath63 per pixel and a spectral resolution of 1.09 @xmath64 per pixel .",
    "figure [ fig : slit ] shows the final 2d spectra ( degraded to @xmath65 ) together with the slit positions on sky .",
    "we measured an rms noise of @xmath66erg / s/@xmath40 ( 4.4@xmath64 resolution element ) in the 10545 - 10565@xmath64 wavelength region , in good agreement with the estimated noise from the the mosfire exposure time calculator , corrected for our estimated slit losses .",
    "absolute flux was measured using the white dwarf spectrophotometric standard star gd71 .",
    "the standard star was observed during the same nights with identical settings and reduced in the same way as the science exposures .",
    "we present the sensitivity curve for the mosfire @xmath54-band in figure [ fig : sensitivity ] together with the line fluxes of the two targets derived from unb filters .",
    "this shows that we would have clearly detected the two laes as it is further discussed below .      assuming the observed fluxes given in @xcite at 10560@xmath64 and based on our measured noise and our seeing of 1@xmath63",
    ", we expect to detect the two sources at a signal - to - noise of 12.4 and 8.2 , respectively , with a line width of 200km / s ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "even with a seeing as bad as 2@xmath63 , the expected signal - to - noise is still 8.8 and 5.8 , respectively . to verify the snr calculation and lack of detection , we simulated the expected 2d spectra by adding lines to the reduced 2d spectra .",
    "for these simulations we assumed the total measured flux was distributed over a truncated gaussian with a rest - frame fwhm ranging from @xmath67 ( observed from stacked spectra it is @xmath68 , e.g. , @xcite ) . for the spatial extent",
    "we assume a gaussian with fwhm of 1@xmath63 corresponding to our seeing .",
    "the following results of our simulation are not sensitive to the actual spatial extent .",
    "we find that the total flux of such a line would have to be less than @xmath69  erg / s/@xmath40 for not to be visible in our data ( for the range in rest - frame line fwhm ) .",
    "vice versa , to miss lae1 ( lae2 ) in our data , we would require a rest - frame fwhm of more than 10@xmath64 ( 7@xmath64 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : slit ] shows the simulated spectra rescaled to @xmath70 assuming the line fluxes measured by @xcite , a line rest - frame fwhm of 1.5@xmath64 , and spatial extent of 1@xmath63 .",
    "this shows a clear expected detection of both ly-@xmath0 lines .",
    "our firm non - detection of line emission in the targeted laes yields an upper limit in ly@xmath0 line flux of @xmath71  erg / s/@xmath40 .",
    "we therefore rule these candidates out on a 7 and 5@xmath72 level , respectively .",
    "this puts on solid ground a recent less significant non - detection by @xcite in 7.5 hours of lbt observation with the luci nir spectrograph .",
    "given these limits , the sources must either be a transient event with decay times of @xmath73 year , very short periodic ( @xmath74 year ) with a large change in flux , or artifacts and/or noise spikes in the data .",
    "considering transients , the most likely events with similar rates are super - luminous supernovae ( ssne ) or agns .",
    "low redshift sne are favorable because the rest - frame nir emission is decaying less rapidly than the optical @xcite .",
    "these events can account for the magnitude change measured in the unb filters @xcite .",
    "however , a simple calculation suggests that a @xmath75 ssn is visible for maximum @xmath76 days ( observed ) including the rise of luminosity before its peak .",
    "however , @xcite searched for objects with variability on these time scales and removed them , therefore we believe these are an unlikely source of contamination , although up to three such events could have happened within 0.2 deg@xmath42 during the year of observations depending on imf @xcite . furthermore , short period agns can be excluded as a source of contamination , because of the amplitude of the variability which exceeds that in known agns @xcite",
    "we thus conclude that the detections are most likely artifacts and noise .",
    "there are several reasons why this could happen .",
    "first of all , detections near the edges of an image can be caused by enhanced noise .",
    "also , estimates of the limiting magnitude by using 50% completeness simulations and/or the use of inappropriate aperture sizes with respect to the seeing may lead to false detections . in the case of the @xcite candidates , the authors use 50% completeness simulations to estimate their limiting magnitudes . also , their candidates seem to lie systematically close ( @xmath77 arcmin ) to the chip gaps between the four newfirm arrays . combined with the findings of @xcite and @xcite , who also find no real detections ,",
    "this raises significant questions about the reliability of the narrow band filter technique with nir detectors for detecting laes at @xmath20 .",
    "note that for @xmath26 , where large spectroscopic follow - up studies of lae candidates are possible , the fraction of low - z interlopers and spurious objects is usually @xmath78% .",
    "whatever the reason , the non - detection of lae1 and lae2 in the mosfire spectra places important limits on the lae lf and implies strong evolution of it at @xmath79 as it will be discussed in the following section .",
    "-band 1@xmath72 sensitivity per 4.4@xmath64 resolution element is shown .",
    "the measured sensitivity is consistent with that of the exposure time calculator corrected for slit losses .",
    "we should be able to detect the two lae candidates at several @xmath72 as shown by the red symbols representing their line fluxes as measured in the unb filter by @xcite.[fig : sensitivity ] ]",
    "a large number of studies have looked at the ly-@xmath0 luminosity function at @xmath26 .",
    "a summary of the surveys at @xmath81 is given in table [ tab : lf1 ] and the mean data points adopted for this redshift range are shown in figure [ fig : literature ] , panel a. it can be seen that the lae lf changes only slightly in this redshift range .",
    "schechter functions fitted to the data as a function of redshift result in less than 15% change in @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively @xcite . note that in this and the following comparisons of lfs , we account for eventual differences in the cosmologies assumed by the authors .",
    "furthermore , some authors apply a correction to their ly@xmath0 luminosities to account for absorption of the ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "this correction is debated as it is shown recently that the ly@xmath0 line profile is asymmetric at @xmath84 where igm absorption is negligible .",
    "this suggests that ly@xmath0 is already redshifted when escaping the galaxy and most probably make the above correction factor superfluous and result in an overestimation of the lae luminosity @xcite .",
    "the lfs presented in this paper are not corrected by this factor .    at @xmath85",
    "there are severals major studies @xcite .",
    "all of these use the subaru / suprime - cam camera with the nb812/nb921 filters .",
    "additional constraints come from @xcite compiling a large sample of lae surveys .",
    "the above studies are summarized in table [ tab : lf2 ] .",
    "these large studies have significant disagreements in the derived luminosity functions with the various studies citing contamination rates , selection functions , and spectroscopic incompleteness as possible sources of disagreement .",
    "the @xcite study uses several widely spaced fields to rule out cosmic variance as the source of the discrepancy . in figure",
    "[ fig : literature ] we combine the various studies , and find that while the fits to the lae lfs done by the different authors disagree , the data are consistent within errors , indicating counting statistics and fitting methods are the likely source of the discrepancy .",
    "we adopt weighted averages of the data points for the redshifts @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 as indicated by the colored symbols in figure [ fig : literature ] panels a through c. in panel d we also show lae detections by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite fluxes , broad - band magnitudes , and ews ) and we therefore include them here . ] , and @xcite at @xmath15 with their weighted averages .",
    "we note that there are differences in the normalization of the above studies which are likely linked to sample incompleteness and contamination ( estimated to be less than 20% for these studies ) .",
    "these uncertainties are captured in the individual error bars , which we take into account in the final error bars of the weighted averages . at @xmath30 , we combine the candidate detections from @xcite and @xcite with the two remaining candidates from @xcite by adding up the comoving volumes of the studies . the new limits at @xmath30 are shown in figure [ fig : literature ] panel e. the single points are shown in figure [ fig : literature ] panel d together with the limit from @xcite shown as gray line .",
    "finally in figure [ fig : literature ] panel e , we show our combined luminosity functions over the redshift range @xmath89 .",
    "this clearly shows a rapid evolution in the number density of bright laes at @xmath90 .",
    "however , it is unclear whether this evolution is driven by changes in the igm opacity , or evolution in the density of the underlying galaxy population .",
    "we will disentangle these two effects in the following section .",
    "ly@xmath0 emission is produced in young galaxies with a substantial amount of on - going star - formation .",
    "it is therefore the amount of uv radiation and the ism of a galaxy which constrains the amount of ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "as the ly@xmath0 photons escape from the galaxy , they get scattered in areas of dense neutral hydrogen in the igm .",
    "the amount of neutral hydrogen around galaxies sets the amount of ly@xmath0 emission that can be measured by our telescopes .",
    "as soon as galaxies are formed , they start to re - ionize larger and larger bubbles of neutral hydrogen around themselves and the transparency for ly@xmath0 photons is increased . by recording the amount of ly@xmath0 emission , i.e. , the rest - frame equivalent width ( ew@xmath91 ) distribution , as a function of redshift , it is therefore possible to estimate the change in the volume fraction of neutral hydrogen , @xmath8 , and therefore map the re - ionization process .",
    "however , the change in the fraction of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies also depends on the density of the underlying galaxy population as well as on internal ( ism ) properties of the galaxies , like star formation rate and dust content .",
    "studies of the ly@xmath0 emission properties of _ uv - continuum selected lbgs _ suggest that the ly@xmath0 emission is rising with redshift in galaxies at @xmath92 @xcite , where the universe is thought to be fully re - ionized .",
    "in particular , @xcite note that the ew distribution in this redshift range ( @xmath93 ) is skewed to larger rest - frame ew values for higher redshifts .",
    "this suggests evolution of the internal properties of galaxies ( e.g. , dust , @xcite ) enhancing the amount of ly@xmath0 emission with increasing redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to constrain the fraction of neutral hydrogen at @xmath34",
    ", we have to separate these effects from the igm .",
    "we therefore first model the intrinsic ( i.e. , without igm absorption ) ly@xmath0 lf ( @xmath944.1 ) .",
    "later , we will compare this intrinsic lf to the observed lfs at different redshifts ( @xmath95 ) and , combined with two possible implementations of the re - ionization process , constrain @xmath8 ( @xmath35 ) .          to separate ism from igm effects on the ly@xmath0 lf",
    "( see also @xcite ) , we first create an empirical model of the lae lf based on the uv lf and the ly@xmath0 rest - frame equivalent width ( ew@xmath91 ) distribution at @xmath96 , where the igm is fully re - ionized . in brief , we assume the @xmath97 uv - continuum lfs of lbgs derived by @xcite and @xcite . these lfs can be well explained by assuming that the luminosity and stellar mass of a galaxy is directly related to its dark - matter halo assembly and gas infall rate @xcite .",
    "especially the lf at @xmath20 are therefore put on more solid ground .",
    "we then convolve these uv lfs with two observed ly@xmath0 ew@xmath91 distributions of @xcite ( @xmath93 ) and @xcite ( @xmath98 ) by using a monte carlo sampling method to estimate a lae lf .",
    "we first draw random galaxies from the uv - continuum lfs . the number of galaxies is defined by the integral of the uv luminosity function at the different redshifts . on the bright end",
    "we integrate to @xmath99 , above which the contribution of galaxies becomes negligible . on the faint end",
    ", we set the integration limit to @xmath100 .",
    "we note , that this is @xmath412 magnitudes below the ly@xmath0 luminosity which is observed at all redshifts . changing @xmath101 above this limit does not change the output of our model .",
    "this faint @xmath101 limit however means extrapolating the observed uv - continuum lfs used from the literature ( usually going down to @xmath102 ) .",
    "so we also verified that the implications of our model are insensitive to changes of the faint end slopes of the uv - continuum lfs and other lf parameters between different studies @xcite . for each of the galaxies drawn from the uv - continuum lf",
    "we then pick a random rest - frame equivalent width from the input distributions and compute the cumulative ly@xmath0 lfs .",
    "we assume no correlation between ew@xmath91 and uv - luminosity for simplicity , although there are hints of less luminous galaxies reaching larger ew@xmath91 compare to more luminous ones ( @xcite but see @xcite and @xcite for a contradictory study ) .",
    "we also assume that every galaxy is emitting ly@xmath0 ( which is then absorbed in the igm and the ew distribution captures the ism physics ) , i.e. , the fraction of ly@xmath0 emission ( @xmath103 ) is 100% for our model .",
    "our models are shown as shaded regions in figure [ fig : model ] , panels a through e. the points show the same weighted averages as in figure [ fig : literature ] and we find that our model is very sensitive to the assumed ew@xmath91 distribution .",
    "this is illustrated by the broad swath of the shaded region indicating the range of values obtained by the @xcite and @xcite ew@xmath91 distributions .",
    "this is not surprising , as from the comparison of the two ew@xmath91 distributions it can be seen that @xcite is missing high ew@xmath91 compared to @xcite which results in a much lower ly@xmath0 lf estimate . in the following",
    "we will assume the @xcite ew@xmath91 distribution as basis because it samples fainter galaxies which contribute to the majority of objects in our sample while @xcite is restricted to uv continuum redshifts and therefore brighter galaxies . to illustrate the dependence on ew@xmath91 further , the dotted , dashed , and dash - dotted lines in figure [ fig : model ] show _ constant _ input rest - frame equivalent widths with ew@xmath104 .",
    "we find good overall agreement between our `` predicted '' lae lf and the observed values up to @xmath15 . but",
    "note in figure [ fig : model ] the observed lae lf moves from the bottom of the predicted range at @xmath105 to the top at @xmath87 .",
    "this indicates the ew@xmath91 distribution appears to be skewing to higher values as found by @xcite ( compare with the lines at constant ew@xmath91 in figure [ fig : model ] ) and is likely caused by decreasing amounts of dust .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath20 the lae lf appears to return to the middle or bottom range of the shaded region predicted by our model . assuming the ( intrinsic ) ew distribution does not change , then a change in the igm is needed to reproduce the observation .",
    "this indicates the igm is becoming more opaque at @xmath20 , suggesting re - ionization finished at @xmath11 .      turning to a more qualitative analysis",
    ", we use our model to constrain the change in neutral hydrogen fraction in the igm at @xmath79 .    for this , we consider two different possibilities of how we think ly@xmath0 photons get absorbed in the igm .",
    "the two different approaches lead to different imprints of re - ionization in the ly@xmath0 luminosity functions . we consider _",
    "( i ) _ a `` black and white '' process where ly@xmath0 emission of a galaxy is either absorbed or not ( `` patchy / absorption model '' ) and _ ( ii ) _ a smooth process where the ly@xmath0 emission is attenuated by a certain degree ( `` smooth / attenuation model '' ) .    the former process will decrease the number of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies irrespective of their emission strength .",
    "it will lead to a `` global '' shift of the lae lf .",
    "the later process will lower the ly@xmath0 emission in all of the galaxies , preferentially removing galaxies with high ly@xmath0 rest - frame equivalent width .",
    "it will lead to a change in normalization _ and _ shape of the lae lf .",
    "for both of these models we can constrain @xmath8 independently .",
    "we estimate @xmath8 for the former by using the simulations by @xcite , for the later we apply the models by @xcite .",
    "we note that with the current data it is not possible to ( dis)prove one or the other approach .",
    "but we will see that both approaches will lead to the consistent results .      in this case",
    "ly@xmath0 is blocked by the neutral igm which results in a decrease of the ly@xmath0 lf for all luminosities .",
    "we tune our model lf to fit the observed lae lfs at @xmath106 5.7 , 6.6 , and 7.7 by adjusting @xmath103 ( the total fraction of galaxies for which ly@xmath0 is not absorbed ) , which is ( at first ) independent of magnitude ( see figure [ fig : reionization ] panels a through c , dotted curves ) .",
    "we find that @xmath103 is almost undistinguishable between @xmath19 but drops by a factor of 4 beyond @xmath107 as it is shown in figure [ fig : reionization ] , panel d by the filled squares .",
    "furthermore , we follow the approach of @xcite and introduce two different values @xmath108 and @xmath109 for simulated galaxies with @xmath110ab and @xmath111ab in order to compare the fraction of ly@xmath0 emitters from our empirical model to real observations at @xmath26 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : reionization ] panels a and b by the dashed line ( we do not apply this split at @xmath30 because of the sparse data ) .",
    "the values for @xmath108 and @xmath109 for ew@xmath112 are shown in panel d ( filled and open circles , respectively ) .",
    "the error bars are estimated by changing the m@xmath113 cut in a range of @xmath114 .",
    "also shown are the observations by @xcite ( light gray ) , @xcite ( black ) , and @xcite ( dark gray ) for galaxies with ew@xmath112 and the same magnitude cut .    in general",
    ", we find a good agreement of @xmath115 with the values observed in uv - continuum selected lbgs at @xmath26 .",
    "we find a significant drop of a factor of @xmath116 in the fraction of ly@xmath0 emitters at @xmath30 compared to @xmath6 .",
    "note that the @xcite estimate of @xmath103 for bright galaxies is a factor of @xmath117 higher than the estimates from the other studies .",

    "we then assume that this re - scaling of the lf is directly proportional to the change in the fraction of ly@xmath0 emitters , i.e. , @xmath120 ( see figure [ fig : reionization ] , panel d , blue and red squares ) . assuming the dust extinction properties at @xmath30 are the same as at @xmath6 , we conclude that the drop in @xmath103 implies a neutral hydrogen fraction of _ at least _",

    "above , we have to take the difference in evolution between @xmath6 and @xmath24 ( assuming the igm is fully re - ionized at @xmath6 ) .",
    "we therefore start directly with the @xmath6 ew@xmath91 distribution ( see figure [ fig : reionization ] , panel a , dotted curve ) and tune it to fit the @xmath30 limits by changing its width ( dashed - dotted line in figure [ fig : reionization ] , panel c ) . from the final ew@xmath91 distribution at @xmath30 , we compute the cumulative fraction @xmath139 which has now changed w.r.t .",

    "we have considered an absorption model resulting in a global shift of the ly@xmath0 lf and an attenuation model resulting in a skewing of the ew@xmath91 distribution and there for a steepening of the ly@xmath0 lf .",
    "note , that both approaches can fit the observed lae lfs within its uncertainty and we are not able to judge which of the models is right .",

    ", we are able to constrain @xmath8 using both approaches , resulting in lower limits for the neutral hydrogen fraction between @xmath150 and @xmath151 at @xmath30 .",
    "finally , we stress that our results are based on the assumption that all changes in @xmath103 and the ew@xmath91 distribution are caused by a change in the ionization state of the igm at @xmath79 . however , and",
    "alternative explanation involves an increase of the escape fraction of ionizing photons and would lead to a drop in @xmath103 and thus an overestimation of @xmath8 @xcite . without a changing ionization state of the igm the escape fraction needed to explain the observations is at odds with other studies @xcite .",
    "however , a mixture of changing @xmath8 ( @xmath152 ) and @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) would be consistent with our results and direct escape fraction measurements .",
