    ", we have witnessed that physics community gradually reaches consensus that the examination of the quantum motions confined on the two - dimensional surfaces in three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath6 is of physical significance . in the euclidean space , the quantum physics",
    "is well defined , one can use conventional quantum mechanics without any new postulate imposed @xcite .",
    "the confinement of the particle on a curved two - dimensional manifold is treated as the limiting case of a particle in a three - dimensional manifold in which _ a confining potential _ is invoked to acting in the normal direction of its two - dimensional surface , and we can then have an unambiguous formulation of quantum mechanics on the surface as a secondary or derived theory @xcite .",
    "however , if one hopes to reproduce the same theory within the dirac s theory for a systems with second class constraints @xcite , some cautions need to be taken into consideration @xcite .",
    "the new formulation of quantum mechanics on the surface involves both gaussian and mean curvature . in simple and plain words ,",
    "the mean curvature @xmath7 , on one hand , is an extrinsic curvature that is not detectable to someone who can not study the three - dimensional space surrounding the surface on which he resides , whereas the gaussian curvature @xmath8 , on the other hand , is an intrinsic curvature that is detectable to the two - dimensional inhabitants  on a surface and not just outside observers @xcite . in purely intrinsic geometry , undefinable and even meaningless",
    "is the shape itself of a surface .    when no electromagnetic field is applied and the spin of the particle plays insignificant role , the marked feature of the theory is the dependence of both an effective potential @xmath9 @xcite in the hamiltonian and the geometric momentum @xmath0 on the mean curvature @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the geometric potential @xcite with @xmath10 denoting the mass,@xmath11 comes from how to define a proper form of laplacian operator acting on a quantum state on surface @xcite , whereas the geometric momentum , with @xmath12 being the gradient operator on a two - dimensional surface @xcite and @xmath13 standing for the normal vector of the surface at a given point , @xmath14 is related to a proper form of gradient operator on the state @xcite . when first exposed to this expression ( [ vggm ] ) apparently containing a term @xmath15 , many thinks it has component along the normal direction , but it is not the case .",
    "actually , it is an operator exclusively defined on the tangent plane to surface at the given point for we have an operator relation @xmath16 with use of a relation@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "one can also call ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ vggm ] ) the embedding potential @xcite and the embedding momentum , respectively . as we see in the appendix , both geometric quantities ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ vggm ] )",
    "can be derived within the same theoretical framework .",
    "an experimental verification of the potential amounts to an indirect affirmative experimental evidence of the momentum as well , and _",
    "vice versa_. the geometric potential has recently been experimentally verified @xcite , and it is an important advance in quantum mechanics , implying that quantum mechanics based on purely intrinsic geometry does not offer a proper description of the constrained motions in microscopic domain , provided that the extrinsic examination is performed as well . here",
    "we mention that the spin of the particle usually plays a role via the surface spin - orbit coupling @xcite , etc.@xcite , obtained also from the same procedure of squeezed limit of its the three - dimensional analogue .    noting that the linear momentum distribution of an electron state within a hydrogen atom can be easily carried out and had been experimentally verified @xcite .",
    "let us consider the simplest constrained motion on two dimensional spherical surface @xmath18 and ask whether it is possible to give a momentum space representation for the states on it . an immediate problem is what the  proper momentum is .",
    "it can never be the usual linear momentum @xmath19 because the motion on @xmath18 has only two degrees of freedom while @xmath20 has three mutually commutable components that are too many to form a complete set of commuting observables for @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , as we stress before @xcite , a set of self - adjoint momentum operators in purely intrinsic geometry is unattainable for any states on @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , the geometric momentum @xmath21 ( [ vggm ] ) alone does not suffice because its three components are not mutually commutable , thus too few to provide a complete set of commuting observables .",
    "the key finding of the present study offers a solution to the problem , based on a discovery of a new dynamical representation on the surface .",
    "the organization of the present paper is as follows . in next sections",
    "ii , we present a unified derivation of both geometric potential ( [ 1 ] ) and momentum ( [ vggm ] ) . in next sections iii , we starts from a dynamical symmetric group @xmath22 on the sphere which yields a proper and complete set of commuting observables , to arrive at a dynamical representation mixing the geometric momentum and orbital angular momentum . in the section iv",
    ", it aims at the explicit form of the geometric momentum distribution of the some molecular rotational states .",
    "section v gives a brief discussion of the results obtained , and conclude the present study .",
    "to get the geometric momentum ( [ vggm ] ) , we utilize exactly the same manner how the geometric potential is derived @xcite . for ease of the comparison , we use similar set of symbols as ferrari and cuoghi who recently build up a theoretical framework with geometric potential when",

    "<S> as a submanifold is embedded into higher dimensional flat space , quantum mechanics gives various embedding quantities . in the present study , two embedding quantities for a two - dimensional curved surface examined in three - dimensional flat space , the geometric momentum and the geometric potential , are derived in a unified manner . </S>",
    "<S> then for a particle moving on a two - dimensional sphere or a free rotation of a spherical top , the projections of the geometric momentum @xmath0 and the angular momentum @xmath1 onto a certain cartesian axis form a complete set of commuting observables as @xmath2=0 $ ] ( @xmath3 ) , thus constituting a dynamical ( @xmath4 ) representation for the states on the two - dimensional spherical surface . the geometric momentum distribution of the state represented by spherical harmonics is successfully obtained , and this distribution for a homonuclear diatomic molecule seems within the resolution power of present momentum spectrometer and can be measured to probe the embedding effect . </S>"
