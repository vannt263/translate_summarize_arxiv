    "the unique eclipses of the pre - main sequence star kh  15d have recently gained attention because of the possibility that they are related to processes of planet formation .",
    "the eclipses were discovered by @xcite during a variability study of the young cluster ngc  2264 .",
    "the optical spectrum of kh  15d is that of a t tauri star @xcite , a category believed to represent a late stage in the accretion and dispersal of circumstellar material and the condensation of planets @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated the age of the star to be 210  myr , from its position on a color - magnitude diagram .    during the eclipses , which recur",
    "every 48.36 days and last @xmath120 days , the star plummets in brightness by over 3 magnitudes in a manner consistent with a knife - edge crossing the face of the star ( see herbst et al .",
    "2002 for a striking presentation and discussion of the light curves ) .",
    "the obscuring matter must be composed of large dust grains or macroscopic objects , because small dust grains would cause reddening of the starlight that is not observed .",
    "if the obscuring material is orbiting the star , it must be spread out over a large fraction of the orbit in order to explain the long duration of the eclipses .",
    "strangely , the star re - brightens near mideclipse , as if the obscuring material is distributed symmetrically about a central opening .",
    "the eclipses are sufficiently dramatic that it appeared possible to investigate their history in photographic plate archives , despite the poor sensitivity and resolution of old photographs compared to modern detectors . in   [ sec : data ] , we describe our findings from the harvard college observatory plate collection . in   [ sec : analysis ] we use the data to place limits on the eclipse properties of kh  15d in the first half of the 20th century .",
    "finally , in   [ sec : discussion ] , we place our results in the context of previous measurements and previously offered theories for the origin of the eclipses .",
    "we searched the collection of the harvard college observatory , one of the world s largest archives @xcite , for plates of ngc  2264 .",
    "the most useful part of the archive was the `` mc series , '' one of the highest - quality plate series in the collection .",
    "it was obtained with the 16-inch @xmath2 metcalf doublet refracting telescope , in cambridge and oak ridge , massachusetts , between 1909 and 1988 .",
    "we found 66 suitable plates in the mc series . in each case",
    "we digitized a @xmath3 region surrounding the expected position of kh  15d , using an optical scanner with a resolution of 3000 pixels  inch@xmath4 and 14 bits  pixel@xmath4 .",
    "we also found one suitable plate in the `` a series , '' taken with the 24-inch @xmath5 bruce doublet in bloemfontein , south africa , on 1936 january 24 .",
    "this plate could not be digitized due to its large physical size ( @xmath6 inches ) . however , the a plate was of much higher quality than any of the mc plates , allowing the analysis described below to be performed visually .",
    "to determine the threshold of detectability of each plate , we chose 10 stars with a range in brightness of roughly 2 magnitudes bracketing the magnitude of kh  15d in its uneclipsed state , and searched for those 10 stars in each image .",
    "these reference stars are identified by kh number in fig .  1a , which is an image of the field from the palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ) .",
    "next , we looked for kh  15d .",
    "this was not a trivial task because its uneclipsed magnitude was usually close to the limiting magnitude .",
    "in addition , a nearby bright star ( hd  47887 ) was often overexposed to such a degree that its `` halo '' of scattered light enveloped the expected position of kh  15d .",
    "this was a particular problem in blue - light observations ( which formed the majority of cases ) because the bright star is very blue . in those cases",
    ", we employed the technique of `` unsharp masking '' commonly used in astrophotography ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this technique ,",
    "one produces a blurred image by convolving the original with a circular gaussian tapering function , and then subtracts a scaled version of the blurred image from the original image .",
    "this enhances contrast by removing low spatial frequencies , at the expense of an increased noise level .",
    "the width of the gaussian function , and the scaling of the blurred image , are adjusted to achieve optimal results . here",
    "the method works because the image of hd  47887 is very broad and flat - topped , whereas images of fainter stars such as kh  15d are more sharply peaked ( see figs .",
    "1b and 1c ) .",
    "star kh  24d , being brighter than kh  15d and slightly further away from hd  47887 , provided a useful test of our ability to detect stars close to the bright central star : if kh  24d could not be detected , surely no useful information about kh  15d could be obtained from that plate .    in this manner",
    "we determined that 40 of the plates had sufficient sensitivity and resolution for kh  15d to have been detected when uneclipsed . among these",
    ", we securely detected kh  15d in 36 cases . in the other 4 cases , we believe kh  15d is present , but we are not as confident in the detection because it is right at the plate limit ( i.e.  brighter comparison stars were detected , but fainter comparison stars were not detected ) .",
    "we summarize the results as follows : in 90% of the cases for which detection of kh  15d was possible , it was securely detected , and there were no secure non - detections .",
    "we have not attempted accurate photometry because of the contaminating influence of hd  47887 .",
    "however , judging from the comparison stars , we conclude that the detection of kh  15d on a given plate rules out an eclipse deeper than 1  mag at that epoch .",
    "thus , the data are consistent with no eclipses deeper than 1  mag .",
    "fig .  2 shows the time coverage of the 40 high - quality plates , and also includes the poss image ( 1951 december 1 ) and the 2 epochs of the dposs-2 images ( 1989 november 7 and 1992 december 21 ) , on which kh  15d appears uneclipsed .",
    "the data fall naturally into four groups in time , which we have distinguished by arbitrary colors and symbols : black triangles , for 19131915 ; red circles , for 19241939 ; green squares , for 19461955 ; and blue diamonds , for 19781992 .",
    "solid symbols are secure detections and open symbols are the ambiguous cases .",
    "we use this data to place limits on the `` eclipse fraction '' @xmath7 , defined as the fraction of time that kh  15d is eclipsed by @xmath81  mag .",
    "the simplest approach is to ignore the modern ephemeris and assume that the phase of each epoch is random .",
    "we also assume , conservatively , that the 4 lower - confidence detections represent eclipses .",
    "then , using binomial statistics with a uniform prior on @xmath7 , the observation that kh  15d is uneclipsed in 39/43 cases implies @xmath9 with 95% confidence .",
    "the result changes to @xmath10 when only the 19241939 data are used , and @xmath11 when only the 19461955 data are used .",
    "a more sophisticated approach is to use the modern ephemeris to convert the time of each observation into @xmath12 , the phase of the photometric period . @xcite",
    "estimated the period to be @xmath13 days . after obtaining additional data , @xcite revised the period to 48.36 days but did not give an error estimate .",
    "we adopt the ephemeris of @xcite , @xmath14 and an uncertainty of 0.02  days in the period . the phase coverage of our observations is shown in fig .  3 , for the choices @xmath15 , 48.36 , and 48.38 days .",
    "the dashed lines show the modern eclipse duration .",
    "the dotted lines show the approximate phases of the mideclipse re - brightenings , during which the star has sometimes been observed at its uneclipsed brightness ( or even slightly brighter ) .",
    "the phase coverage is fairly complete and can be used to rule out eclipses with the present characteristics .",
    "suppose , for example , that the past eclipses were nearly symmetric about mideclipse , as they are today .",
    "we define the `` eclipse duty cycle '' @xmath16 as the fraction of the photometric period between the 1  mag levels of ingress and egress . in general , @xmath17 because of the possibility of mideclipse re - brightenings .",
    "we determine the maximum phase of the eclipses , @xmath18 , as the minimum @xmath19 among all the secure detections , not counting detections with @xmath20 ( where re - brightenings are expected ) .",
    "the resulting limit on the eclipse duty cycle is @xmath21 . to deal with the period uncertainty , we determine @xmath18 for all possible values of @xmath22 , and",
    "then compute a weighted histogram of the results , using a weighting function that is gaussian in @xmath22 with mean 48.36  days and @xmath23  days .    using all the data , the result is @xmath24 with 95% confidence . using only the data from 19241939 ,",
    "the result is @xmath25 . with only the 19461955 data , the result is @xmath26 .",
    "neither the earliest data nor the most recent data are constraining by themselves .",
    "we conclude that the deep eclipses of kh  15d observed today did not occur in the first half of the 20th century with their present characteristics .",
    "the eclipses may have been shorter in duration or shallower than 1  mag , or perhaps the mideclipse re - brightenings extended to larger phases . of course , a combination of these effects or a more complex time history are also possible .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the eclipses have grown in duration , as has been observed over the last decade .",
    "4 shows the upper limits on the eclipse duty cycle derived at the end of the previous section , along with modern values that we estimated from the light curves of @xcite and from unpublished data from 2002 - 3 obtained by a group led by one of the authors ( p.g . ) . apparently a change is occurring on decadal timescales , in either the features of the obscuring material surrounding the kh  15d system , or in the alignment of those features with our viewing angle .",
    "what could explain both the eclipses and their recent onset ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite offered two hypotheses to explain the eclipses : ( 1 ) kh  15d has a nearly edge - on protoplanetary disk , and a warp or ridge in the disk periodically blocks the star . ( 2 ) kh  15d has a higher - mass companion that is hidden by an edge - on circumstellar disk . the observed star is eclipsed as its orbit carries it through the projected plane of the disk .",
    "@xcite offered another hypothesis : ( 3 ) kh  15d has a low - mass companion , and the resulting accretion and outflow of circumstellar material creates an asymmetric common envelope , with a large and dense region near the low - mass companion .",
    "the orbital motion of the secondary causes periodic occultations of the primary .",
    "hypothesis ( 2 ) seemed unlikely even before this work , because @xcite and @xcite measured only a small radial velocity shift ( @xmath27  km  s@xmath4 ) between widely separated phases .",
    "those authors also expressed concern about systematic effects that may allow the true radial velocity shift to be zero .",
    "in addition , we do not know how to make this hypothesis compatible with the recent onset of the eclipses .",
    "the low - mass companion of hypothesis ( 3 ) could be small enough to be allowed by the current radial velocity measurements .",
    "@xcite do not make any specific statements regarding the expected timescale of changes in eclipse duration , but they do claim that their model can explain decadal variations seen in other young photometrically active stars such as ux ori stars .",
    "this makes hypothesis ( 3 ) viable and worthy of further investigation .",
    "hypothesis ( 1 ) is not only consistent with a small radial velocity shift , but also naturally involves a physical timescale that is compatible with our result .",
    "the viscous timescale at the orbital distance of 0.2  a.u .",
    "( corresponding to the 48-day period ) is 10100 years .",
    "if protoplanet / disk interactions cause perturbations in the disk , then one would expect these perturbations to evolve on this timescale .",
    "all other timescales in the disk at 0.2  au are much shorter : the dynamical and cooling timescales are @xmath02 days , while a single - impulse perturbation would be damped in less than 1 month @xcite .",
    "thus , protoplanet / disk interactions are an appealing explanation of the kh  15d phenomenon and the observed evolution .    for the sake of providing a concrete and falsifiable example of such an interaction , we indulge in further speculation , elaborating on a suggestion by @xcite .",
    "models of planet formation at larger orbital distances predict density perturbations in the form of two spiral waves : a leading wave extending to smaller orbital distances , and a lagging wave extending to larger distances ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the spiral waves extend more than a radian in azimuth , and for a jupiter - mass planet the density is enhanced by a factor of 3 - 5 even at one pressure scale - height , @xmath28 , above the midplane . for a typical t tauri disk ,",
    "the optically thick portion of the disk extends to a height of @xmath29 above the midplane @xcite , corresponding to 0.02  a.u .  at the estimated orbital distance ( 0.2  a.u . ) of the occulting feature .",
    "this thickness is approximately equal to the diameter of the young star ( @xmath30  a.u . ) .",
    "the spiral shock waves induced by a jupiter - sized protoplanet are capable of increasing @xmath31 by more than a factor of 2 and creating an elongated ridge along our line of sight that is thick enough to block the central star entirely . moreover ,",
    "as previously suggested @xcite and recently demonstrated with three - dimensional computational models @xcite , the ridge will have a local depression at the position of the protoplanet , which would explain the mid - eclipse re - brightenings .",
    "if this is correct , our nave prediction is that the eclipse duty cycle will increase to @xmath10.75 and remain there for the next decade , because in the simulations , the spiral waves cover a maximum of @xmath175% of the orbit . furthermore , if the true period is actually 97 days , as suggested by @xcite based on small differences between alternate eclipses , this scenario would be wrong .",
    "we emphasize that this speculation was inspired by simulations at much larger orbital distances ; we are not aware of any detailed simulations of protoplanet / disk interactions at 0.2  a.u .",
    "finally , we note that although the harvard collection does not happen to include many photographs of this field after 1960 , many such photographs undoubtedly exist .",
    "because of its placement in a scientifically interesting young cluster , and near a photogenic nebula , there should be many images from 1960 onward that are of sufficient quality to measure kh  15d .",
    "a compilation of these data should reveal the onset of the modern eclipse behavior .",
    "the authors wish to thank alison doane and doug mink for valuable assistance with the plate archive .",
    "this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no ."
