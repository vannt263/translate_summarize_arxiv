    "@xcite in terms of the stewart - mccumber model,@xcite both the dynamics of the josephson phase in the squid and the position of a brownian particle can be described by similar langevin equation .",
    "@xcite therefore time evolution of the josephson phase is analogous to a random motion of a brownian particle in a spatially periodic potential . while prior studies have mostly been focused on the current - voltage characteristics , diffusion of the josephson phase , i.e. its mean - square displacement , has not been intensively analyzed .",
    "there are only several papers closely or loosely related to this latter subject.@xcite    in this work , we study diffusion of the josephson phase in the asymmetric squid @xcite which is composed of three capacitively and resistively shunted josephson junctions .",
    "two junctions are collocated in series in one half - piece of the ring and the third junction is disposed in the other half of the ring .",
    "the squid is driven by a time - periodic current and subjected to an external constant magnetic flux .",
    "its dynamics is extremely rich and complex even in the deterministic case , involving harmonic , subharmonic , quasiperiodic and chaotic trajectories . at non - zero temperature , thermal fluctuations lead to diffusive behaviour with random escape events among possibly coexisting attractors and with the system typically exploring its whole phase space . due to a multi - dimensionality of the parameter space describing the model it would be extremely difficult to perform a complete analysis of diffusion process of the josephson phase in such a setup .",
    "therefore we consider it only in the previously reported regime @xcite for which the stokes efficiency of the squid attains its global maximum .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present a model of the asymmetric squid in terms of the langevin equation for the josephson phase .",
    "next , we define several quantifiers characterizing the quality of transport process occurring in this setup . among them",
    "are those that relate directly to an asymptotic long time stationary average voltage drop like its variance and the stokes efficiency of the squid .",
    "however , we also study in this context those connected with the realization of stochastic motion of the josephson phase like its mean squared displacement and a diffusion coefficient .",
    "we also combine these complementary quantities into the so called pclet number . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present results based on the comprehensive numerical simulation of the studied system in a regime for which the transport efficiency is globally maximal . in particular , we demonstrate a possibility of steering of diffusive behaviour of the phase by tuning the experimentally accessible parameters like the amplitude of ac current applied to the system or the external magnetic flux .",
    "it turns out that the diffusion coefficient can be significantly enhanced by small variation of these quantities .",
    "moreover , we establish a clear relation between the directed transport , its efficiency and the diffusive motion of the josephson phase .",
    "it is very important that the regime of globally maximal transport quality measured by the stokes efficiency is also effective in the sense that phase motion is ordered and regular .",

    "if @xmath60 , it is generally asymmetric and is called a ratchet type , see fig .",
    "however , even for @xmath60 there are certain values of the external flux @xmath61 for which it is still symmetric .",
    "the rescaled zero - mean gaussian white noise @xmath62 has the auto - correlation function and its intensity @xmath63 is the quotient of the thermal and the josephson coupling energy . from now on we will use only the dimensionless quantities and therefore we skip all hats appearing in ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "there are several quantifiers characterizing transport properties of the system .",

    ". moreover , there are also intervals where several attractors coexist .",
    "this , in fact , is enough to observe the phenomenon of _ deterministic diffusion _ @xcite . at sufficiently high temperature",
    ", the system will be typically ergodic with thermal fluctuations enabling stochastic escape events among coexisting deterministic separate attractors .",
    "in particular , transitions between neighbouring periodic solutions give rise to diffusive directed transport .",
    "let us now briefly discuss an influence of the external magnetic flux @xmath125 on all previously introduced transport measures . from the symmetry considerations of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) it follows that for an arbitrary integer number @xmath126 , the transformation @xmath127 reverses the sign of the average voltage @xmath128 .",
    "this fact can be directly observed in panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "there are two intervals where the average voltage drop assumes non - zero values which differ only with the direction of transport .",
    "since the external magnetic flux alters the effective potential experienced by the phase @xmath35 we conclude that in order to detect the average voltage one must tune it to a given rocking mechanism in the form of the ac driving of the amplitude @xmath87 and the frequency @xmath89 . similarly to the previously discussed case this fact is reflected in the dependence of the stokes efficiency @xmath44 on the external magnetic flux @xmath125 .",

    "still , there are also intervals where the diffusive motion of the phase @xmath35 can be observed with @xmath115 . in particular , panel ( d ) presents the dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath79 on the external magnetic flux @xmath125 for such a scenario : one can conveniently manipulate the phase diffusion by change of the external magnetic flux .",
    "this way of control of the diffusion process is very convenient from the experimental point of view .",
    "+      we now focus on the influence of inertia described by the capacitance @xmath119 of the squid on the phase diffusion , see fig .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( c ) depict the average voltage drop @xmath67 across the device and the stokes efficiency @xmath44 as a function of the capacitance @xmath119 .",
    "they are non - monotonic functions similar in shape but without any immediately obvious relation to each other .",
    "however , the most important observation is that in the vicinity of a point corresponding to the maximum transport efficiency @xmath44 also the voltage drop @xmath67 is large .",
    "notably , it lies closely to the border between overdamped @xmath129 and damped @xmath130 regime . in panel",
    "( b ) , fluctuations of the phase velocity are depicted .",
    "one can notice an evident correlation , when velocity fluctuations are maximal , the efficiency is minimal .",
    "the next two panels present the diffusive behaviour as a function of the same parameter . in panel",
    "( d ) one can see that the transport is essentially diffusive @xmath115 for entire interval of the inertial term variance .",
    "the last plot depicts the diffusion constant @xmath79 versus the capacitance @xmath119 of the device . in the overdamped",
    "limit the transport is rather regular as the diffusion coefficient is very small . on the contrary ,",
    "an increase of inertia is accompanied by simultaneous grow of the phase diffusion with a sharp increase in the vicinity @xmath131 .",
    "one can observe that when the average voltage @xmath67 and stokes efficiency @xmath44 are locally minimal and velocity fluctuations are maximal then the diffusion coefficient @xmath79 takes its maximum .",
    "consequently , the transport is highly irregular and not optimal .",
    "therefore we validate that quantities characterizing the phase diffusion in the device are somehow complementary to those usually used in order to describe the quality of transport .",
    "they give additional information which often corresponds well with the one measured by the voltage fluctuations ( [ eq10 ] ) or the efficiency ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "it is intriguing to find a deeper reason of the sharp increase of @xmath79 in the vicinity @xmath131 . in fig .",

    "the relevant panels comparing all discussed quantities are presented in fig .",
    "one can see that an increase of the thermal fluctuation intensity @xmath132 leads to monotonic decrease of both the average voltage drop @xmath67 across the squid and its voltage rectification efficiency @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is a regime for which impact of thermal fluctuations is destructive",
    ". it is confirmed in the last two panels of this figure where the phase diffusion process is studied .",
    "not unexpectedly , the system is diffusive for the entire range of thermal fluctuation intensity @xmath132 .",
    "it is because thermal noise activates stochastic transitions between coexisting deterministic disjoint attractors .",
    "moreover , in the last panel we can see that when the temperature grows the transport becomes more and more diffusive as the diffusion coefficient @xmath79 monotonically increases .",
    "we collect part of our results by presenting the dependence of the dimensionless pclet number on the squid capacitance @xmath119 and the thermal noise intensity @xmath132 .",
    "the corresponding panels can be found in fig .",
    "in the first one the reader can observe clear separation between the overdamped @xmath129 and underdamped @xmath130 regimes . in the former case the pclet number is large indicating the transport of predominantly regular nature .",
    "contrary , in the latter one it is small saying that the phase motion is chaotic or diffusive . having in mind that this particular regime is essentially non - chaotic ,",
    "we conclude that in that region of a parameter space transport is diffusive .",
    "this fact support our previous statement on that subject .",
    "moreover , the most important remark is that the pclet number corresponding to the point @xmath133 of globally maximal stokes efficiency @xmath44 is relatively large being evidence of the diffusive but still highly regular transport . in panel",
    "( b ) of the same figure we can observe a fast monotonic decay of the pclet number with increasing temperature of the system .",
    "therefore , in this regime thermal fluctuations have destructive impact on all transport quantifiers , starting from the average voltage @xmath67 , by the stokes efficiency @xmath44 of the squid and finally up to irregularity of the phase motion reflected in the large diffusion coefficient @xmath79 .",
    "we have studied diffusion process of the josephson phase in the asymmetric squid system .",
    "our analysis has been restricted to the regime of the maximal stokes efficiency of the device and found normal diffusion with the exponent @xmath115 .",
    "we have searched a neighbourhood of this point in the parameter space to check robustness of the observed behaviour in domains @xmath134 . when the amplitude @xmath87 of ac current is changed two windows of normal diffusion are detected ( panel ( c ) in fig .",
    "4 ) . in turn when the applied magnetic field is varied four intervals of normal phase motion are observed ( panel ( c ) in fig .",

    "we have presented the possibility of convenient manipulation of the diffusion coefficient @xmath79 by tuning the experimentally accessible parameters of the setup like the ac driving amplitude @xmath87 or the external magnetic flux @xmath125 .",
    "surprisingly , by doing it one can change its value several times .",
    "this lead us to the phenomenon of _ diffusion enhancement_.    last but not least , we have found that the regime of maximal stokes efficiency is essentially _ non - chaotic_. regions where only a single period one attractor exists dominate the parameter space in the vicinity of this prominent area .",
    "consequently , the phase motion is there non - diffusive .",
    "however , there are also intervals where due to the coexistence of several deterministic separate attractors the phase diffusion process can be observed .",
    "then , sufficiently large thermal fluctuations enable stochastic transitions between them resulting in the diffusive directed transport .",
    "overall , thermal noise has destructive impact on all presented quantities measuring the quality of transport in the system , starting from the average voltage @xmath67 and ending on the diffusion coefficient @xmath79 .",
    "it is remarkable that the non - diffusive or regular nature of the phase motion across the device is detected mainly in the overdamped regime @xmath129 .",
    "contrary , when the inertial term is increasing then the transport becomes more and more diffusive .",
