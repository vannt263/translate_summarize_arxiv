    "the arrival direction of charged cosmic rays with primary energies between several hundred tev and 10  pev is remarkably isotropic .",
    "a possible anisotropy would reflect the general pattern of propagation of cosmic rays in the galactic environment .",
    "model calculations , e.g.  of @xcite show that diffusion of cosmic rays in the galactic magnetic field can result in an anisotropy on a scale of @xmath3 to @xmath2 depending on particle energy and strength and structure of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the diffusion is rigidity dependent , the cited model calculation reports roughly a factor of five to ten larger anisotropy for protons than for iron primary particles with the same energy .",
    "this rigidity - dependent diffusion is one of several explanations of the steepening in the cosmic ray energy spectrum at around 4  pev .",
    "another class of models explains this so - called knee in the energy spectrum as a result of a change in the acceleration efficiency of the source ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "there is no change in anisotropy at the knee expected from these models , while the models based on diffusion should result in an increase at about  4 pev .",
    "anisotropy measurements give , in addition to the measurements of mass dependent energy spectra , valuable information for the discrimination between models explaining the knee in the cosmic - ray energy spectrum .    due to",
    "the small anisotropy expected a large data sample is necessary .",
    "the flux of cosmic rays in the pev energy range is too low for direct measurements by experiments on satellites or balloons .",
    "ground based experiments with large collecting areas measuring the secondary products of the interaction of the primary cosmic rays with earth s atmosphere are presently the only way to collect a suitable amount of events .",
    "few statistically significant anisotropies were reported from extensive air shower experiments in the last two decades .",
    "eas - top @xcite published an amplitude of @xmath4 at @xmath5  tev .",
    "the akeno experiment @xcite reported results of about @xmath6 at about 5 to 10  pev .",
    "an overview of experimental results can be found in @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "the large scale cosmic - ray anisotropy is studied by application of the rayleigh formalism to data of the kascade air shower experiment .",
    "the two - dimensional distribution of arrival directions of cosmic rays is reduced to one coordinate due to the limited field of view and the small amplitudes expected from theory and previous observations . a first order approximation of the multipole expansion of the arrival directions of cosmic rays is a harmonic analysis of the right ascension values of extensive air showers .",
    "the rayleigh formalism gives the amplitude @xmath7 and phase @xmath8 of the first harmonic , and additionally the probability @xmath9 for detecting a spurious amplitude due to fluctuations from a sample of @xmath10 events which are drawn from a uniform distribution @xcite : @xmath11 the sum includes @xmath10 right ascension values @xmath12 .",
    "studies of higher harmonics are very limited as the expected amplitudes are too small compared to the statistical fluctuations of the data sets available .    in this article an analysis of data from the kascade experiment",
    "is presented , which is described in the following section .",
    "the data selection procedures , including an enrichment of light and heavy primary particles are presented in sections  3 and  4 .",
    "section  5 describes the corrections applied to the shower rates depending on atmospheric ground pressure and temperature .",
    "the main results , i.e.  the rayleigh amplitudes for all showers as well as for the mass enriched samples can be found in section  6 .",
    "the extensive air shower experiment kascade ( ka_rlsruhe _ s_hower _ c_ore and _ a_rray _ de_tector _ ) is located at forschungszentrum karlsruhe , germany ( @xmath13  e , @xmath14  n ) at a.s.l . corresponding to an average vertical atmospheric depth of .",
    "kascade measures the electromagnetic , muonic , and hadronic components of air showers with three major detector systems : a large field array , a muon tracking detector , and a central detector @xcite .    in the present analysis data from the 200@xmath15200  m@xmath16 scintillation detector array are used .",
    "the 252 detector stations are uniformly spaced on a square grid of 13  m. the stations are organized in 4@xmath154 electronically independent clusters with 16 stations in the 12 outer and 15 stations in the four inner clusters . the stations in the inner / outer clusters contain four / two liquid scintillator detectors covering a total area of 490  m@xmath16 .",
    "additionally , plastic scintillators are mounted below an absorber of 10  cm of lead and 4  cm of iron in the 192 stations of the outer clusters ( 622  m@xmath16 total area ) .",
    "the absorber corresponds to 20 electromagnetic radiations lengths entailing a threshold for vertical muons of 230  mev .",
    "this configuration allows the measurement of the electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers . the number of electrons ( @xmath17 ) and muons ( @xmath18 ) in a shower , the position of the shower core and the shower direction are determined in an iterative shower reconstruction procedure . the truncated muon number ( @xmath18 ) denotes the number of muons in the distance range from 40 to 200  m to the shower core .",
    "shower directions are determined without assuming a fixed geometrical shape of the shower front by evaluating the arrival times of the first particle in each detector and the total particle number per station . the angular resolution for zenith angles less than 40@xmath19is 0.55@xmath19  for small showers and 0.1@xmath19  for showers with electron numbers of @xmath20 .",
    "the detector array reaches full detection efficiency for extensive air showers with electron numbers @xmath21 corresponding to a primary energy of about @xmath22 ev .",
    "this is defined by a detector multiplicity condition resulting in a trigger rate of about 3  hz . the data set for the following analysis contains @xmath0 events recorded in 1600 days between may 1998 and october 2002 .",
    "because of the very small amplitudes expected a very careful data selection is necessary .",
    "contributions from amplitudes in local solar time can cause spurious signals in sidereal time .",
    "this leakage is due to the very small difference in daylength between a solar and a sidereal day ( @xmath23 s ) .",
    "amplitudes in solar time can be caused by variation of atmospheric ground pressure and temperature , and will be corrected for ( chapter 5 ) . to minimize these spurious effects ,",
    "several cuts are applied to the measured showers in order to enhance data quality . in the following ,",
    "rates are determined in time intervals of half an hour ( in sidereal time @xmath24 si seconds ) . in detail",
    "the selection criteria are :    1 .",
    "to ensure reconstruction quality , only showers well inside the detector field with a maximum distance to its center of 91  m and with zenith angles smaller than @xmath25@xmath19  have been used .",
    "the latter cut restricts the visible sky to the declination band @xmath26@xmath19@xmath27@xmath19 .",
    "2 .   more than 249 out of 252 detector stations have to be in working condition .",
    "sudden changes of the rate are detected by testing the uniformity of the rate as a function of time for each sidereal day .",
    "no deviations of the rates from the mean rate larger than 4@xmath28 determined over the whole measurement time are allowed .",
    "4 .   only sidereal days with continuous data taking are used .",
    "the array has to be fully efficient ( 100% ) for eas detection .",
    "simulations show that this is the case for electron numbers @xmath21 .",
    "after application of these quality cuts about 20% of the showers from the initial data set are left . in total 269 out of 1622 sidereal days with continuous data taking",
    "are used in the following analysis .",
    "the seasonal distribution of these days is as follows : 114 days in spring ( february - april ) , 18 in summer ( may - july ) , 77 in autumn ( august - october ) , and 60 in winter ( november - january ) .",
    "to evaluate the dependence of a possible rayleigh amplitude on primary energy and mass , the data set is divided by a simple cut in the @xmath29-@xmath30 plane into two sets .",
    "simulation studies show , that showers initiated by light primary particles are predominately electron rich while those from heavy primaries are electron poor @xcite .",
    "the extensive air showers are simulated utilising the corsika package @xcite .",
    "the qgsjet - model @xcite is used for hadronic interactions above @xmath31  gev , gheisha @xcite for interactions below this energy .",
    "the electromagnetic cascades are simulated by egs4 @xcite .",
    "the shower simulation is followed by a detector simulation based on geant @xcite .",
    "a power law with constant spectral index of @xmath32 is used in the simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : gammasep ] shows the distribution of muon number versus electron number ( @xmath33-@xmath34 ) of showers measured with kascade and from the mentioned simulations of proton- and iron - induced showers .",
    "there are several reasons for the differences between the measured and the simulated distributions .",
    "the chemical composition of cosmic rays consists of more than two components , the slope of the energy spectrum of the cosmic rays is different in the simulations and the number of measured showers exceeds by far the number of simulated showers",
    ".    a separation between light and heavy primaries can be expressed by the following ratio : @xmath35 the electron number @xmath36 and the truncated muon number @xmath18 are zenith angle corrected to @xmath37@xmath19  using the attenuation law : @xmath38 with the attenuation lengths @xmath39  g / cm@xmath16 and @xmath41  g / cm@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this separation neglects the large fluctuations , especially of proton initiated showers .",
    "it also neglects the very different relative abundances of light to heavy primaries in cosmic rays .",
    "the influence of the atmospheric ground pressure @xmath9 and temperature @xmath42 on the rate of extensive air showers at ground is taken into account by a second order polynomial with additional time dependent corrections @xmath43 for @xmath44 different configurations of the detector system ( e.g.  with slightly different high - voltages of the detectors ) : @xmath45 the detector parameters are constant during each of the @xmath44 time intervals .",
    "@xmath46 s@xmath47 , @xmath48 hpa , @xmath49@xmath19c are the long - time mean values of rate , ground pressure , and temperature .",
    "all parameters @xmath50 and @xmath43 are estimated by a fit to the time dependent rates for the whole interval of four years and result in : @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 in units of hpa , @xmath19c , and seconds .",
    "the values for the @xmath43 are between @xmath56 and @xmath57 s@xmath47 .",
    "the correction itself is done for time intervals of 1795 s by subtracting or adding the necessary number of events calculated by equation  [ equ : barokorr ] .",
    "events are chosen randomly from the half - hour intervals to lower the number of showers .",
    "the events , which have to be added for this correction are chosen randomly from the set of showers of the same sidereal day .",
    "the quality of the correction can be estimated from figure  [ fig : atmos ] .",
    "the left figure shows the event rate distributions before and after the corrections .",
    "the uncorrected rates reflect the asymmetric distribution of the atmospheric ground pressure .",
    "the distribution of corrected rates is compatible with a gaussian distribution , which is expected from remaining statistical fluctuations of the event rate .",
    "the right figure shows the cross correlation between rate and ground pressure .",
    "the very strong correlation @xmath58 visible for the uncorrected rates vanishes after the correction ( @xmath59 ) with equation  [ equ : barokorr ] .",
    "an example for the right ascension distributions of showers after atmospheric correction for electron numbers in the interval @xmath60 is shown in figure  [ fig : radis ] .",
    "the rayleigh amplitudes @xmath7 of the right ascension distributions for electron numbers in the range from @xmath61 to @xmath62 are calculated according to equation  [ equ : ray ] .",
    "the lower electron number limit is the efficiency threshold of the kascade detector field .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : cuts ] , full efficiency is required in order to minimize effects of the threshold to the amplitudes .",
    "the upper electron number limit at @xmath62 is determined by the small number of events ( @xmath63 ) in this electron number interval .",
    "the showers are sorted in intervals of electron number @xmath34 and not in intervals of truncated muon number @xmath33 , although the latter one is a better estimator for primary energy and less dependent on the mass of the primary particle .",
    "the trigger threshold of the detector field is mainly determined by the number of electrons .",
    "the usage of @xmath64 combined with the requirement of full detection efficency would shift the lower energy threshold of this analysis to energies above @xmath65 ev .",
    "figure  [ fig : rayintp200 ] ( left - hand side ) shows the resulting rayleigh amplitudes .",
    "the lines indicate the confidence levels for rayleigh amplitudes with probabilities @xmath66 of 68/95/99 % respectively . assuming a power law with spectral index @xmath67 for the form of the electron size spectrum , the confidence levels are as well power laws with spectral indices of @xmath68 ( see equation  [ equ : rayp ] ) .",
    "the confidence levels are only a function of the number of events used in the analysis .",
    "the increase of the confidence levels with electron number reflects therefore by no means an increase of anisotropy .",
    "amplitudes which are below the lines indicating the confidence levels can be treated as fluctuations and are of no physical meaning .",
    "all calculated amplitudes are well below the 95% line .",
    "the fluctuation probability @xmath69 of each rayleigh amplitude is shown in figure  [ fig : rayintp200 ] ( right - hand side ) .",
    "the probabilities are all above 5% .",
    "there are no hints for nonzero rayleigh amplitudes within the statistical limits .",
    "the results of the two subsets of data containing electron - rich and electron - poor showers are shown in figure  [ fig : rayintpfe ] . no correction for ground pressure @xmath9 and temperature @xmath42",
    "is applied in this case .",
    "the variations of @xmath9 and @xmath42 alter beside the detection rate also the number of electrons and muons in a shower and therefore the effect of the separation line ( equation  [ equ : gammassepcut ] ) between electron - poor and electron - rich showers .",
    "a further correction would require detailed information about the influence of atmospheric variations on @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which is beyond the scope of this analysis .",
    "only a detection of significant amplitudes would require such further steps . as can be seen from figure  [ fig : rayintpfe ]",
    ", no anisotropy can be deduced from the calculated amplitudes and fluctuation probabilities .",
    "the most prominent amplitude at @xmath70 has a significance of @xmath71 .",
    "the intersection of the confidence levels of electron poor and rich showers is due to the increasing fraction of heavy primary cosmic rays with increasing primary energy in the region of the knee @xcite .    additionally to the results presented in figures [ fig : rayintp200 ] and [ fig : rayintpfe ] , an analysis of the data set with different definitions of the electron number intervals and for showers above the knee sorted by truncated muon numbers yielded the same result of no significant amplitudes .",
    "figure  [ fig : results ] shows the upper limits on the large scale anisotropy derived in this analysis in context with results from other experiments and predictions from the model of @xcite .",
    "the primary energies of the extensive air showers measured by kascade are determined by a linear transformation of the particle numbers @xmath34 and @xmath33 .",
    "the transformation matrix is determined from corsika simulations using the hadronic interaction models qgsjet and gheisha .",
    "the uncertainty of this simplified primary energy determination is about 20% .",
    "the figure shows that the kascade upper limits are in the range of the reported results from other experiments .",
    "the eas - top experiment reported somewhat lower limits in the energy range below @xmath72 ev .",
    "the relatively large amplitudes published by the akeno experiment are difficult to reconcile with the results of this analysis .",
    "the model calculations , which dependent of course on several parameters like the source distribution or the strength and structure of the galactic magnetic field , yield amplitudes in the range of @xmath73 to @xmath6 in the energy range of kascade .",
    "this is about a factor of 4 - 10 lower than the upper limits derived in this analysis .",
    "the contribution from anisotropy measurements towards a solution of the enigma of the knee are therefore still small .",
    "a significant observation of the anisotropy of separate cosmic ray components around and above the knee requires much larger data sets compared to the presently available .",
    "the authors would like to thank the members of the engineering and technical staff of the kascade collaboration who contributed with enthusiasm and commitment to the success of the experiment .",
    "the kascade experiment is supported by the german federal ministry of education and research and was embedded in collaborative wtz projects between germany and romania ( rum 97/014 ) and poland ( pol 99/005 ) and armenia ( arm 98/002 ) .",
