    "the perturbative nature of the strong interaction at small distances  often referred to as `` asymptotic freedom ''  was established more than 30 years ago and provided strong support for quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) to be accepted as the correct theory for strong interactions  @xcite . on the other hand , calculations at long - distances",
    "are still beyond reach because of the non - perturbative nature at this scale . as a result",
    ", we are still far away from being able to describe the strong force as it manifests itself in the structure of baryons and mesons  @xcite@xcite .    a fundamental approach to resolve this difficulty is to develop accurate numerical simulations of qcd on the lattice , for recent reviews see  @xcite .",
    "however lattice qcd methods are difficult to apply to light - quark systems such as the nucleon .",
    "alternatively , hadron models with effective degrees of freedom have been constructed to interpret data .",
    "one example is the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite , which is constrained only by the symmetry properties of qcd .",
    "the constituent quark model , though not fully understood , is one successful example that works almost everywhere from hadron spectroscopy to deep inelastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "predictions for the scattering amplitudes and polarization - dependent asymmetries exist for many resonances within the framework of the relativistic constituent quark model ( rcqm )  @xcite and the single quark transition model ( sqtm )  @xcite .",
    "the comparison between these predictions and experimental results , on the other hand , is not straightforward .",
    "this is because the experimentally measured cross sections and asymmetries are usually complicated combinations of resonant and non - resonant amplitudes and couplings , and their interference terms . to compare with theories ,",
    "partial wave analyses are often used to extract these amplitudes and resonance couplings from data .",
    "once comparisons can be made , data are used to provide inputs for constructing or adjusting meson production mechanisms in theories and models , such as proper treatment of the hadronic final state and implementation of the non - resonant part of the meson production amplitude .",
    "these mechanisms are usually not included in quark models .",
    "examples of phenomenological partial wave analyses that can benefit from more data are maid  @xcite , janr  @xcite , said  @xcite , and the dmt  @xcite models .",
    "electron - scattering data used to test these calculations include primarily @xmath8 transition form factors and response functions for meson production reactions obtained from jefferson lab ( jlab ) , mami and mit - bates .",
    "recently , polarization observables such as double spin asymmetries and target spin asymmetries for pion electro - production from the proton have made the beam- and target - helicity response functions accessible  @xcite , providing a new approach to testing models and to a greater understanding of the baryon resonance structure . as an example , the maid model was based mostly on unpolarized data and is only recently being tested extensively against double polarization asymmetries .",
    "in general , polarization observables provide an important constraint on the understanding of the underlying helicity response functions or interference terms in @xmath9 and @xmath10 resonances .    compared to the proton ,",
    "existing data on neutron excitation were particularly sparse .",
    "neutron data have recently become available from jlab  @xcite , which make it possible to test the isospin structure of models such as rcqm and sqtm .",
    "the neutron data will be valuable to the development of many phenomenological analyses as well because they need to incorporate double polarization asymmetry data for all pion production channels from both the proton and the neutron in order to perform the full isospin decomposition .",

    "however , data using real photons show a strong helicity-3/2 dominance and @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that @xmath22 for these two resonances must cross zero at some intermediate @xmath2 and there have been calculations for the @xmath2-dependence of @xmath22 from various models  @xcite . for pion electroproduction ,",
    "the double spin asymmetry is dominated by @xmath22  @xcite and thus data on this observable will allow us to test a possible sign flip for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 resonances .",

    "<S> we report measurements of target- and double - spin asymmetries for the exclusive channel @xmath0 in the nucleon resonance region at jefferson lab using the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) . </S>",
    "<S> these asymmetries were extracted from data obtained using a longitudinally polarized nh@xmath1 target and a longitudinally polarized electron beam with energies 1.1 , 1.3 , 2.0 , 2.3 and 3.0 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the new results are consistent with previous clas publications but are extended to a low @xmath2 range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( gev@xmath5)@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 access was made possible by a custom - built cherenkov detector that allowed the detection of electrons for scattering angles as low as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are compared with the unitary isobar models janr and maid , the partial - wave analysis prediction from said and the dynamic model dmt . in many kinematic regions our results , in particular results on the target asymmetry , help to constrain the polarization - dependent components of these models . </S>"
