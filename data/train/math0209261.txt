    "the notion of a veronese web was introduced by i.m.gelfand and i.s.zakharevich @xcite as a natural invariant of bihamiltonian structures of corank 1 .",
    "they conjectured that locally this invariant is complete , i.e. determines the bihamiltonian structure up to an isomorphism .",
    "this conjecture was proved by f.j.turiel @xcite .",
    "let us briefly recall relevant definitions .",
    "assume that we have a 1-parameter family @xmath7 of distributions of codimension 1 on a smooth manifold @xmath8 such that in a neighbourhood of any point there exist an annihilating @xmath3 1-form @xmath9 and a coframe @xmath10 with the property @xmath11 ( we assume that @xmath12 annihilates @xmath13 and write @xmath14 for the space of sections of a vector bundle ) .",
    "we call this family of distributions a veronese curve of distributions .",
    "we say that it is integrable or it is a veronese web if each distribution @xmath3 is integrable , i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( it can be shown that @xmath17 ) .    the equation ( [ 1 ] ) is polynomial of degree @xmath18 in @xmath4 , hence it is sufficient that it is satisfied for @xmath19 different values of @xmath4 in order that it is satisfied for any @xmath20 . in other words ,",
    "integrability of @xmath3 at @xmath19 different points implies integrability of a veronese curve of distributions .",
    "it is remarkable that this number can be essentially reduced .",
    "i.zakharevich @xcite conjectured that the integrability of @xmath3 at @xmath21 different points implies the integrability of the veronese curve of distributions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to prove this result in a more general setting .",
    "we give it for generalized veronese curves of distributions .",
    "the precise definition is given in section 1 .",
    "here we shall only mention that integrable generalized veronese curves of distributions coincide with a particular case of the so called kronecker webs introduced in @xcite .",
    "the last notion serves as an invariant of bihamiltonian structures of higher corank in the same manner as the notion of a veronese web does this for bihamiltonian structures of corank 1 ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "one of possible applications of our result is that it allows to generalize theory of nonlinear wave equations  @xcite to higher dimensional and codimensional cases .",
    "also it may help to establish new relations between veronese webs and classical webs . in  @xcite such relations",
    "are studied in the case @xmath22 .",
    "briefly , our method can be described as follows .",
    "given @xmath21 foliations corresponding to the integrable points of the curve of distributuins @xmath3 , we construct locally a curve of foliations @xmath23 in a larger space such that @xmath23 projects onto @xmath3 , so proving the integrability of @xmath3 .",
    "our proof works only in the real - analytic category , since it uses the complexifications of the objects .",
    "this , of course , is one of the disadvantages of the method .",

    "[ d2 ] a generalized veronese curve of distributions @xmath34 is called integrable or a generalized veronese web if each distribution @xmath3 is integrable , i.e. @xmath35 for some depending on t 1-forms @xmath36 ( we put @xmath37 ) .",
    "the corresponding foliations will be denoted by @xmath38 .",

    "let @xmath25 be a manifold of dimension @xmath26 and let @xmath33 be an integrable generalized veronese curve of distributions of codimension @xmath28 on @xmath8 .",
    "then for any point @xmath65 there exist a coordinate map @xmath66 and a germ along @xmath67 of an integrable distribution @xmath68 ( @xmath69 stands for the real tangent bundle ) such that for any @xmath70 :    1 .",
    "the distribution @xmath71 is integrable ( we assume that the value @xmath72 corresponds to @xmath73 ) ; 2 .",
    "@xmath74 ; 3 .",
    "the distribution @xmath50 is projectable on @xmath67 along the germ of the foliation @xmath75 ; 4 .",
    "the projection of @xmath76 coincides with @xmath77 .",
    "proof let @xmath78 be different nonzero numbers .",
    "then the foliations @xmath79}{\\cal w}(a_{n+1})$ ] are in general position and for any point one can find a neighbourhood @xmath67 and functions @xmath80 on @xmath67 such that @xmath81 .",
    "we define a new family of distributions @xmath82 , of codimension @xmath28 by @xmath83 here @xmath84 stands for the linear span , @xmath85 is the adjoint operator to the complex structure @xmath86 , @xmath87 is the projection along the foliation @xmath88 defined in ( 3 ) , and @xmath89 are the annihilating @xmath3 1-forms ( see definition [ d1 ] ) .",
    "now , let us define the distribution @xmath52 as @xmath90 or @xmath91    notice that the 1-forms @xmath92 corresponding to different powers of @xmath4 in @xmath93 , are linearly independent . therefore the standard properties of the veronese curve ( of degree @xmath94 ) imply that @xmath95 or @xmath96 ( here we put @xmath97 ) .",
    "this allow us to prove the integrability of @xmath52 by showing the integrability of @xmath98}f(a_{n+1})$ ] .",
    "evidently , @xmath99 for some functions @xmath100 .",
    "similarly , @xmath101 for some functions @xmath102 .",
    "thus @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( here we used the obvious facts that @xmath105 , and that @xmath106 ) .",
    "now it is easy to check the frobenius integrability conditions using the nondegeneracy of the matrix @xmath107 for any @xmath108 .",
    "so the distributions @xmath109 are indeed integrable .    to prove ( 1 ) we choose another set of generators for @xmath110 as follows @xmath111 where @xmath112 , and notice that @xmath113 now the integrability for @xmath114 can be proved by the same considerations as for @xmath52 and the integrability of @xmath50 follows from lemma .",
    "in order to prove ( 2 ) we mention that @xmath115 by the construction and that @xmath116 is the isomorphism for any @xmath70 : the inverse operator is given by the formula @xmath117",
    "@xmath118    now we are able to prove ( 3 ) .",
    "we need to show that the distribution @xmath119 is integrable for any @xmath70 .",
    "we fix @xmath120 , choose @xmath121 to be different real numbers and calculate the annihilators : @xmath122 it is easy to see that the collection of 1-forms @xmath123 is a coframe on @xmath124 , hence the 1-forms @xmath125 , ca nt be linearly expressed by the 1-forms @xmath126 which are combinations of @xmath127 .",
    "so , finally , @xmath128 and the distribution @xmath129 is integrable . in the same manner one can show that @xmath130    simultaneously , the last two equations prove item ( 4 ) .",
    "let @xmath25 be a manifold and let @xmath131 be a generalized veronese curve of distributions of codimension @xmath28 on @xmath8 .",
    "then in order that @xmath131 is a generalized veronese web it is sufficient that it is integrable at @xmath21 different points @xmath132 .",
    "proof a careful analysis of the proof of theorem 1 shows that this proof uses only integrability of @xmath133 at @xmath134 and arbitrary different nonzero finite points @xmath135 for the construction of the distribution @xmath68 such that @xmath50 is integrable for any @xmath70 and is projectable onto @xmath3 .",
