    "the optical identification of a complete sample of 674 rass x - ray sources yielded a stellar subsample of 274 sources ( zickgraf et al .",
    "1997 , appenzeller et al .",
    "1998 , krautter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the rass sample is distributed over six study areas located at @xmath6 and covering 685 sq .",
    "degrees ( see fig . [ area ] ) .",
    "the flux limit is mostly 1.810@xmath7ergs@xmath8@xmath9 and in the smaller area v 610@xmath10ergs@xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "the stellar sample contains about 20% f and as much g stars , 33% k stars ( with and without h@xmath11 emission ) , and 21% m stars , most of them , i.e. 90% , of type dme .",
    "the @xmath5 distribution of the stellar sample ( excluding cataclysmic variables and white dwarfs ) is shown in fig . [ logns ] . in the flux range",
    "@xmath12ergs@xmath8@xmath9 the slope is @xmath13 calculated using a maximum - likelihood method . below 210@xmath7ergs@xmath8@xmath9",
    "the distribution is even flatter with a slope of @xmath14 .",
    "the slope of the distribution is therefore flatter than the euclidean slope of @xmath15 .",
    "it is also flatter than derived for low @xmath0 from the galactic plane survey by motch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who obtained a slope of @xmath16 for an area in cygnus .",
    "the deviation from the euclidean value indicates that the stellar sample at high @xmath0 is affected by the scale height of the galactic distribution of stellar x - ray emitters . while the average @xmath5 is consistent with age dependent models for the space distribution of x - ray active stars by guillout et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for @xmath17 , area i ( south of tau - aur ) deviates as discussed already by zickgraf et al .",
    "( 1998 ) due to an excess of lithium - rich pms stars ( see sect . [ lithium ] ) .",
    "during several observing runs spectra of @xmath18 g , k , and m stars have been obtained ( medium and high resolution ) in order to search for the absorption line .",
    "the results are summarized in tab .",
    "[ litab ] .",
    "equivalent widths have been converted to abundances using the curves of growth by pavlenko & magazz ( 1996 ) .",
    "so far , in 15 of 67 k stars strong lithium lines have been found .",
    "most of them , i.e. eight k stars , are located in area i which contains 20 k and ke stars . in areas ii , iii , and vi 7 of 47 k and ke stars exhibit strong li - absorption lines .",
    "even 2 of 40 m stars show very strong lithium lines , one in area i and the other one in area ii . whereas the survey in 4 of the 6 areas is complete for the k and m stars , it is not yet complete for the g stars . however , three g stars in area i exhibit strong lithium , and three further g stars have considerable li - absorption . in area",
    "vi one of three g stars observed so far exhibits considerable li - absorption .",
    "we searched the hipparcos , tycho , ppm , starnet ( rser 1996 ) , and act ( urban et al .",
    "1997 ) catalogs for the stars in our sample in order to obtain proper motions .",
    "figure [ prop1 ] shows the proper motions and the respective vectors of motion for area i. the li - rich stars have proper motions clustering in a smaller range than stars without significant lithium .",
    "the two lithium - rich stars in the lower right corner of the left panel of fig .",
    "[ prop1 ] deviating in proper motion are v774tau and v891tau .",
    "they also have a different direction of motion and different radial velocities ( cf .",
    "[ radvel ] ) and possibly belong to the uma cluster at a distance of about 20pc .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocities measured for stars in area i are shown in fig .",
    "[ radvel ] . for most li - rich stars the radial velocity ( rv ) is close to the mean rv for the taurus ttauri stars of 16 - 17kms@xmath8 .",
    "the mean and range of the rv measured by neuhuser et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for pms stars south of taur - aur are displayed as long and short dashed lines , respectively .",
    "these stars are probably located at a mean distance of @xmath19pc .",
    "the two stars with the lowest @xmath20 are the same as mentioned above .",
    "zickgraf et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimated an age of @xmath21myr for the lithium - rich stars in area i. the proper motions and radial velocities suggest that they form a kinematically rather homogenous group consistent with their young age ( cf . also frink et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "preliminary results of the investigation of proper motions in the other areas are shown in fig.[oprop ] . in area",
    "ii the li - rich stars seem to follow the general trend in proper motion . in area",
    "vi three of the four li - rich stars move in the same direction whereas for the other stars no clear pattern is discernible .",
