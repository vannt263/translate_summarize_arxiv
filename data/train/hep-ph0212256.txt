    "chiral symmetry is believed to govern interactions among hadrons at low energies where the relevant degrees of freedom are not the quark and gluon fields of the qcd lagrangian , but composite hadrons . in order to make contact with experiment one must resort to methods such as chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) which incorporates the symmetries and symmetry breaking patterns of underlying qcd and is written in terms of the active degrees of freedom .",
    "a systematic loop expansion can be carried out which inherently involves a characteristic scale @xmath9 gev at which the chiral series is expected to break down .",
    "the limitation to very low - energy processes is even enhanced in the vicinity of resonances .",
    "the appearance of resonances in certain channels constitutes a major problem to the loopwise expansion of chpt since their contribution can not be reproduced at any given order of the chiral series .",
    "this can be prevented by including the resonance exchanges explicitly with the couplings fixed from electromagnetic and hadronic data . in that case",
    ", however , the theory loses its predictive power and does not provide a stringent test of chiral symmetry .",
    "recently , considerable effort has been undertaken to combine the effective chiral lagrangian approach with non - perturbative methods , both in the meson - baryon sector @xcite and in the purely mesonic sector @xcite .",
    "the combination with non - perturbative schemes have made it possible to go to energies beyond @xmath10 and to generate resonances dynamically .",
    "two prominent examples in the baryonic sector are the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 .",
    "the first one is an @xmath1-wave resonance just below the @xmath13 threshold and dominates the interaction of the @xmath14 system",
    ". the properties of the @xmath11 which appears at the correct position with the right width were reproduced remarkably well in @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis was performed in @xcite where in addition to the @xmath12 the @xmath15 was also obtained via the inclusion of the @xmath16 channel .",
    "the @xmath12 is of particular interest since it decays very strongly into the @xmath17 channel and provides insight into the @xmath17 interaction .",
    "applying the same formalism as in @xcite , the authors in @xcite could generate the @xmath12 , which they identify as a quasi - bound @xmath18-@xmath19 state .",
    "information on the @xmath12 was experimentally extracted from precise eta photoproduction data off protons close to threshold at mami ( mainz ) @xcite and together with an analogous electroproduction experiment performed at elsa ( bonn ) @xcite the data covered the whole range of the @xmath12 resonance .    in general , photoproduction of mesons",
    "is a tool to study baryonic resonances and the investigation of transitions between these states provides a crucial test for hadron models .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath20 in the photoproduction of pions , e.g. , has allowed to extract information on its electromagnetic transition amplitudes .",
    "because of their hadronic decay modes nucleon resonances have large overlapping widths , which makes it difficult to study individual states , but selection rules in certain decay channels can reduce the number of possible resonances .",
    "the isoscalars @xmath6 and @xmath2 are such examples since , due to isospin conservation , only the isospin-@xmath21 excited states decay into the @xmath17 and @xmath22 channels .",
    "electroproduction experiments are even more sensitive to the structure of the nucleon due to the longitudinal coupling of the virtual photon to the nucleon spin and might in addition yield some insight into the possible onset of perturbative qcd .",
    "perturbative qcd should apply at sufficiently high photon virtuality @xmath23 , see e.g.  @xcite , however there is no consensus about how high the momentum transfer must be .",
    "it has been found experimentally , that in the case of electroproduction of the @xmath20 resonance at momentum transfers up to @xmath24 gev@xmath25 perturbative qcd is not applicable , @xcite , whereas a possible onset of scaling in the reaction @xmath26 at @xmath27 gev@xmath25 is reported in @xcite .",
    "clas at jlab has also electroproduced @xmath6 mesons for invariant momentum transfers @xmath28 between 0.375 and 1.375 gev@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "it was found that the @xmath5 photocoupling @xmath29 decreases much slower with @xmath28 than , e.g. , the nucleon dipole form factor , which is unusual and difficult to explain theoretically .",
    "furthermore , there is still some controversy about the nature of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 couplings . for @xmath6 photoproduction in the @xmath32 resonance region ,",
    "e.g. , both an effective lagrangian approach @xcite and coupled channel models @xcite have been employed . in these approaches the coupling of the @xmath6 to the nucleons",
    "is described by both a pseudovector and a pseudoscalar term and the coupling constant and the coupling structure of the born terms is unknown . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that differential cross sections are rather sensitive to the assumptions about this vertex , but within the framework of chiral perturbation theory this coupling is fixed at lowest order by making use of the chiral @xmath33 symmetry of the lagrangian , whereas explicitly chiral symmetry breaking terms appear at higher orders .",
    "the @xmath33 symmetric limit provides therefore a convenient starting point which overcomes the problem of fixing the @xmath30 vertex .",
    "the @xmath34 chiral meson - baryon lagrangian has been used in a coupled channel model @xcite and by adjusting a few parameters a large amount of low - energy data was described . all the above mentioned investigations",
    "have in common that they treat the @xmath6 meson as a pure @xmath34 octet state @xmath35 and mixing of @xmath35 with the corresponding singlet state @xmath36 which yields the physical states @xmath6 and @xmath2 is neglected .",
    "the @xmath2 is interesting by itself .",
    "the qcd lagrangian with massless quarks exhibits an @xmath33 chiral symmetry which is broken down spontaneously to @xmath37 , giving rise to a goldstone boson octet of pseudoscalar mesons which become massless in the chiral limit of zero quark masses . on the other hand ,",
    "the axial @xmath3 symmetry of the qcd lagrangian is broken by the anomaly .",
    "the corresponding pseudoscalar singlet would otherwise have a mass comparable to the pion mass @xcite .",
    "such a particle is missing in the spectrum and the lightest candidate would be the @xmath2 with a mass of 958 mev which is considerably heavier than the octet states . in conventional chiral perturbation theory the @xmath2",
    "is not included explicitly , although it does show up in the form of a contribution to an lec .",
    "however , it is also possible to include the @xmath2 explicitly in the chiral lagrangian framework as has been done , e.g. , in @xcite for the purely mesonic sector which was then extended to include baryons in @xcite . within this framework the @xmath2 is combined with the goldstone bosons @xmath38 into a nonet and the @xmath30 and @xmath31 couplings are constrained by chiral symmetry .",
    "the @xmath2 photoproduction has been investigated theoretically in @xcite . in the effective lagrangian approach of @xcite",
    "a pseudoscalar coupling of the @xmath2 to the nucleons was chosen and it was concluded that the @xmath22 decay channel is dominated by the not so well established @xmath39 resonance , whereas in the quark model used in @xcite the off - shell effects of the @xmath32 were prominent .",
    "in contrast , the experimental data from elsa @xcite suggested the coherent excitation of two resonances @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in @xcite @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath2 photoproduction has been studied in the coupled channel formalism working along the lines of @xcite . however , the treatment of the @xmath2 is incomplete and only the leading terms in the meson - baryon potentials are taken into account .",
    "their results fail to reproduce the @xmath6 photoproduction data and are unable to describe the appearance of a @xmath5 resonance for @xmath2 photoproduction as reported at elsa . in order to predict the cross sections for electroproduction , which will become available from experiments at jefferson lab in the near future @xcite ,",
    "a much more thorough investigation is needed .    in the present work",
    "we will focus on @xmath0 photo- and electroproduction off nucleons in a framework which allows a unifying description of these processes with chiral symmetry and unitarity being the main ingredients .",
    "this is achieved by combining the effective lagrangian with a non - perturbative scheme based on coupled channels and the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the approach contains only a few parameters , both coupling constants in the lagrangian , so - called low - energy constants ( lecs ) , and finite range parameters which appear in the evaluation of the loop integrals . with this small set of parameters",
    "it will be a highly non - trivial task to reproduce the data on meson photo- and electroproduction and meson - baryon scattering experiments which are described simultaneously within this multi - channel analysis .",
    "hence this investigation will provide a test whether processes up to energies of @xmath42 gev are still constrained by chiral symmetry and whether the @xmath2 meson can be included in the effective lagrangian with baryons as proposed in @xcite .",
    "we will perform a global fit to a wide range of meson - baryon scattering and photoproduction data . to this end , we restrict ourselves to @xmath1-waves and therefore the comparison with data should only be valid in the near threshold region . at higher energies @xmath43-waves",
    "start dominating , as can be seen , e.g. , in the work by caro ramon et al .",
    "one of the purposes of this work is to shed some light on the @xmath1-wave resonance @xmath40 which can be studied in the @xmath1-wave approximation .",
    "our results must be compared to the cross section reported in @xcite .",
    "we will continue giving predictions for @xmath6 and @xmath2 electroproduction processes and compare our results with the @xmath6 electroproduction data from clas @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the present framework also provides an at least qualitative explanation of the slow fall - off with increasing @xmath28 of the @xmath32 photocoupling .",
    "effects of @xmath6-@xmath2 mixing and the importance of the @xmath2 contributions in this coupled channel formalism even for processes where it appears only as a virtual state are discussed in detail .",
    "this may eventually lead to a better understanding of gluonic effects and the significance of the axial @xmath3 anomaly in low - energy hadron physics .    in the next two sections ,",
    "we introduce the effective lagrangian and the coupled channel formalism which is then generalized to electroproduction processes .",
    "the results of our analysis are presented and compared to existing @xmath0 photoproduction and @xmath6 electroproduction data in sec .  5 , where also predictions for @xmath2 electroproduction are made .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec .",
    "in this section , we will shortly review a systematic way of including the @xmath2 in the chiral effective lagrangian . for details the reader",

    "the lagrangian of the preceding section could in principle be used to calculate the one - loop diagrams of @xmath2 electroproduction , but the perturbative expansion of the chiral series will be useless for this case .",
    "first , the @xmath2 with a mass of 958 mev close to the scale of chiral symmetry breaking @xmath143 gev introduces a new massive scale in the effective theory which spoils the strict chiral counting scheme unless one imposes large @xmath65 counting rules @xcite , @xmath144 , it has been shown that the usage of infrared regularization yields a well - behaved chiral series since loops with an @xmath2 are suppressed @xcite ] .",
