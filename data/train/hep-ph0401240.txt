    "leptogenesis @xcite provides a simple and elegant explanation of the cosmological matter - antimatter asymmetry .",
    "a beautiful aspect of this mechanism is the connection between the baryon asymmetry and neutrino properties . in its simplest version leptogenesis",
    "is dominated by the @xmath0 violating interactions of the lightest of the heavy majorana neutrinos , the seesaw partners of the ordinary neutrinos .",
    "the requirement of successful baryogenesis yields stringent constraints on the masses of light and heavy neutrinos .",
    "in particular , all light neutrino masses have to be smaller than @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "leptogenesis is closely related to classical gut baryogenesis @xcite , where the deviation of the distribution function of some heavy particle from its equilibrium distribution provides the necessary departure from thermal equilibrium .",
    "the non - equilibrium process of baryogenesis is usually studied by means of boltzmann equations @xcite . in the same way ,",
    "leptogenesis has been studied during the past years , with increasing sophistication @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to provide an analytical description of the leptogenesis process such that the dependence on the neutrino mass parameters becomes transparent . as we shall see this is important to understand the size of corrections to the simplest boltzmann equations , which have to be taken into account to arrive eventually at a ` theory of leptogenesis ' .",
    "we will first consider the simplest case where the initial temperature @xmath7 is larger than @xmath1 , the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino @xmath8 .",
    "we will also neglect decays of the two heavier neutrinos @xmath9 and @xmath10 , assuming that a generation of @xmath11 asymmetry from their decays either does not occur at all or that it does not influence the final value of @xmath11 .",
    "further , we restrict ourselves to the non supersymmetric case , and we assume that the lightest heavy neutrino @xmath8 is the only relevant degree of freedom beyond the standard model particle species .    within this minimal framework the boltzmann equations can be written in the following form , @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the number density @xmath14 and the amount of @xmath11 asymmetry , @xmath15 , are calculated in a portion of comoving volume that contains one photon at temperatures @xmath16 , so that the relativistic equilibrium @xmath8 number density is given by @xmath17 .",
    "there are four classes of processes which contribute to the different terms in the equations : decays , inverse decays , @xmath18 scatterings and @xmath19 processes mediated by heavy neutrinos .",
    "the first three all modify the @xmath8 abundance and try to push it towards its equilibrium value @xmath20 . denoting by @xmath21 the hubble expansion rate , the term @xmath22 accounts for decays and inverse decays , while the scattering term @xmath23 represents the @xmath18 scatterings .",
    "decays also yield the source term for the generation of the @xmath11 asymmetry , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ lg2 ] ) , while all other processes contribute to the total washout term @xmath24 which competes with the decay source term .",
    "the expansion rate is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the total number of degrees of freedom , and @xmath27 is the planck mass .",
    "note that we have not included the @xmath8 degrees of freedom since , as we will see , in the preferred strong washout regime , the heavy neutrinos are non - relativistic when the baryon asymmetry is produced .",
    "the two terms @xmath28 and @xmath29 depend on the _ effective neutrino mass _ @xcite , defined as @xmath30 which has to be compared with the _ equilibrium neutrino mass _ @xmath31",

    "@xmath33 is the @xmath8 decay width . the washout term @xmath34 has two contributions , @xmath35 ; the first term only depends on @xmath2 , while the second one depends on the product @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the sum of the light neutrino masses squared @xcite .",

    "the efficiency factor @xmath42 is normalized in such a way that its final value @xmath43 approaches one in the limit of thermal initial abundance of the heavy neutrinos @xmath8 and no washout ( @xmath44 ) . in general , for @xmath45 , one has @xmath46 . the first term in eq .",

    "2 with the basic framework of decays and inverse decays . in the two regimes of weak ( @xmath56 ) and",

    "@xmath18 scatterings are added in sect .  3 , and the resulting lower bounds on the heavy neutrino mass @xmath1 and on the initial temperature @xmath7 are discussed . in sect .  4 an analytic derivation of the upper bound on the light neutrino masses is given , and in sect .",
    "5 various corrections are described which have to be taken into account in a theory of leptogenesis . in appendix a a detailed discussion of the @xmath19 processes in the resonance region",
    "is presented . in the case of",

    "the resulting boltzmann equations are compared with previously obtained results based on exact kadanoff - baym equations . in appendix",
    "b various useful formulae are collected .",
    "recently , two potentially important , and usually neglected , effects on leptogenesis have been discussed : the @xmath18 processes involving gauge bosons @xcite and thermal corrections at high temperature @xcite .",
    "further , the strength of the @xmath19 washout term has been corrected @xcite compared to previous analysis .",
    "however , the reaction densities for the gauge boson processes are presently controversial @xcite .",
    "also the suggestion made in @xcite to include thermal masses as kinematical masses in decay and scattering processes leads to an unconventional picture at temperatures @xmath57 , which differs qualitatively from the situation at temperatures @xmath58 .",
    "if thermal corrections are only included as propagator effects @xcite their influence is small .",
    "this issue remains to be clarified .",
    "fortunately , both effects are only important in the case of weak washout , i.e. for @xmath56 , where the final baryon asymmetry is strongly dependent on initial conditions in any case . in the strong washout regime , @xmath48 , which appears to be favored by the present evidence for neutrino masses",
    ", they do not affect the final baryon asymmetry significantly . in the following",
    "we will therefore ignore gauge boson processes and thermal corrections .",
    "these questions will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "the main results of this paper are summarized in the figures  6 , 9 and 10 .",
    "illustrates that for the basic processes of decays and inverse decays the analytical approximation for the efficiency factor agrees well with the numerical result .",
    "the figure also demonstrates that scatterings lead to a departure from this basic picture only for values @xmath59 , where the final baryon asymmetry depends strongly on the initial conditions .",
    "9 shows the dependence of the efficiency factor on initial conditions and on @xmath18 scatterings for different values of the effective higgs mass @xmath60 .",
    "again , for @xmath48 this dependence is small and , within the theoretical uncertainties , the efficiency factor is given by the simple power law _",

    "10 shows the lower bound on the initial temperature @xmath7 as function of @xmath2 . in the most interesting mass range favored by neutrino oscillations it is about one order of magnitude smaller than the lower bound on @xmath1 .",
    "the smallest temperature @xmath61  gev is reached at @xmath62  ev . in sect .",
    "4 an analytic expression for the light neutrino mass bound is derived , which explicitly shows the dependence on the involved parameters .",
    "it is very instructive to consider first a simplified picture in which decays and inverse decays are the only processes . for consistency , also",
    "the real intermediate state contribution to the @xmath63 processes has to be included .",
    "the kinetic equations ( [ lg1 ] ) and ( [ lg2 ] ) then reduce to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the contribution to the washout term due to inverse decays . from eqs .",
    "( [ ef ] ) and ( [ dlg1 ] ) one obtains for the efficiency factor , @xmath66 as we shall see , decays and inverse decays are sufficient to describe qualitatively many properties of the full problem .    after a discussion of several useful analytic approximations we will study in detail the two regimes of weak and strong washout .",
    "the insight into the dynamics of the non - equilibrium process gained from the investigation of these limiting cases will then allow us to obtain analytic interpolation formulae which describe rather accurately the entire parameter range .",
    "all results will be compared with numerical solutions of the kinetic equations .",
    "let us first recall some basic definitions and formulae .",

    "@xmath74    the inverse decay rate is related to the decay rate by @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the equilibrium density of lepton doublets .",

    "thermal corrections are small .",
