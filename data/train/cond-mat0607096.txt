    "previous studies have shown an interesting interplay between magnetic fields parallel to the dwcnt axis and the interwall interaction near the fermi energy.@xcite a minimal hamiltonian of a dwcnt can be set up as @xmath119 by defining the intrawall interaction as described for swcnts .",

    "( color online ) upper panel : spectrum of a system of two concentric atomic rings .",
    "atom spacing and coupling inside each ring are taken from graphene .",
    "the distance @xmath127 between the rings as well as the the parametrization of the coupling between the rings follow those given in the text for dwcnts .",
    "the sketch displays the prevalent links between the shells .",
    "even though the geometry is irregular , the area of circular paths is very near to integer multiples of @xmath128 , leading to a clear periodicity of the modulation in the spectrum .",
    "lower panel : an isolated unit cell of a dwcnt with the same radii as the planar double ring of the upper panel .",
    "this system has smallest closed loops at an angle against the magnetic field , resulting in an effective smallest area of @xmath129 and leading to a doubling of the period .",
    "furthermore , the system has two atoms in the rotational periodic cell , leading to two interlaced modulations . ]    as a representative example , the butterfly of a ( 6,6)@(11,11 ) dwcnt is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwcnt ] . for the parallel magnetic field ,",
    "the interwall interaction gives rise to features at two levels : looking at individual bands , one can observe van hove singularities crossing and sometimes avoid a crossing .",
    "the complex rules whether a crossing is avoided are not obvious from studying the butterfly plot only , but can be deduced by looking at the band structure and taking into account the various symmetries of the system . at larger scale in the butterfly plot , one finds a modulation of the pattern crossing from @xmath130 at @xmath37 to @xmath131 at @xmath132 .    to understand this phenomenon ,",
    "we have studied a single unit cell in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the resulting concentric ring ( fig .  [",
    "fig : doublering ] ) .",
    "the spectrum shows a periodic behavior of the modulation with a period @xmath133 relating to the area of the minimal circular path between both walls .",
    "this period and the shape of the modulation are independent of the diameter of the dwcnt .",
    "a physical explanation for this modulation is as follows . like the interaction in a two - atomic molecule , splitting two atomic orbitals into a bonding and an antibonding molecular orbital , the interwall interaction may also hybridize swcnt states of the same energy into bonding and antibonding dwcnt states",
    ". however , the system has an approximate rotational symmetry , so the interwall interaction may only hybridize states of the same angular momentum .    at zero magnetic field ,",
    "the angular momentum of the states at the bottom of the spectrum is zero in both shells .",
    "this allows hybridization , causing a split in the hybrid spectrum . at the upper end of the spectrum ,",
    "the angular momentum does not match , prohibiting a hybridization .",
    "this is the cause for the strong electron - hole asymmetry visible in dwcnt butterfly plots .    by switching on a parallel magnetic field",
    ", the effective angular momentum is shifted by the aharonov - bohm phase gathered on a circular path around the tube .",
    "this shift depends on the cross section of the path , so it is different for the two shells .",
    "therefore , the energy at which both angular momenta match depends on the magnetic field , causing the splitting region to travel over the energy range , which leads to the visible modulation in the parallel field butterfly plots .    for a simplified model  a double - wall square lattice tube",
    " the modulation does follow a single cosine - shaped curve , as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : doublering ] . in comparison",
    ", the dwcnt shows an additional complexity : the underlying honeycomb lattice of graphene has a unit cell containing two atoms , resulting in two intertwined cosine curves , the second just becoming visible at the edge of fig .",
    "[ fig : dwcnt ] .    for fields perpendicular to the axis of a dwcnt ,",
    "the only large - scale effect caused by the interwall interaction observable in the butterfly plot is the hybridization - induced splitting already described for zero field . with growing field ,",
    "this effect disappears , and the plot shows no remarkable global patterns .",
    "the magnetic spectrum of two - dimensional infinite lattice electrons gives rise to the well - known hofstadter butterfly . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that quasi - one - dimensional lattice electrons exhibit a spectrum which does resemble the fractal structure of the hofstadter butterfly but with a finite cutoff due to the transversal confinement .",
    "we have calculated such pseudofractals for carbon nanotubes , a material at the focus of many nanoelectronic studies also in relation to the presence of external magnetic fields .",
    "we have calculated the density of states ( butterfly plots ) of several single wall carbon nanotubes and we could show ( i ) the strong dependence of the magnetic spectrum on the underlying chiral indices ; ( ii ) the emergence of the graphene hofstadter butterfly at increasing nanotube diameter . in particular , perpendicular fields induce an aperiodic and pseudofractal magnetic spectrum .",
    "periodic structures have been obtained for graphene ribbons , demonstrating that the aperiodicity of the perpendicular field butterfly plots is due to the incommensurability of the magnetic flux captured by elementary ( hexagon ) plaquettes of a cnt oriented at different angles towards the external field .    by studying",
    "the angle - resolved electronic structure of a swcnt one can observe the emergence of snake states already predicted for nonuniform magnetic fields in a hall bar.@xcite in our case , we have been able to devise an analytical model for the states at the top and the bottom of the energy spectrum by means of an effective mass approximation . in this latter case",
    "a continuum theory can capture the striping of the wave function along the region of the tube with zero normal field .",
    "inversely , near the fermi level , one can not bypass the dirac neutrino nature of the electronic states .",
    "we have interpreted the wave function striping by writing a harper equation@xcite for square lattice electrons with a cylindrical geometry .    while the effects of parallel fields are of comparably simple nature in swcnts ( being an expression of the aharonov - bohm oscillations due to a rigid shift of the graphene band structure sampled via the zone - folding method ) , this is not the case for dwcnts .",
    "the electron - hole symmetry of @xmath0 bands in swcnts is broken once two shells are put in interaction .",
    "the resulting hybridization of inner and outer states could be clearly understood by means of two interacting aharonov - bohm rings .",
    "experimentally relevant effects have been calculated for swcnts of diameter of typical external shells in mwcnts . there",
    "underlying multifractal structure like that of hofstadter can be observed already at a few tens of tesla , and an outstanding scaling law for the dos at low magnetic fields near the fermi energy has been given .",
    "the latter applies also to graphene ribbons and is intrinsically related to the massless dispersion at the charge neutrality point .",
    "this study , though systematic , could not include very interesting issues which also deserve careful investigation , such as the effects of disorder on the butterfly plots of swcnts .",
    "disordered swcnts can be thought in fact a model for the external shell of mwcnts .",
    "more atomistically one could study the influence of the interwall interaction of the structure of large diameter dwcnts ( also reasonable models for mwcnts).@xcite",
    "we acknowledge fruitful discussions with j.  kono , s.  krompiewski , e.  heller , u.  rler , and c.  strunk .",
    "ulrich rler made us aware of the interesting history of science involving douglas hofstadter , gregory wannier , and gustav obermeir which took place in regensburg during the mid 1970s and eventually led to the discovery of the hofstadter butterfly thirty years ago .",

    "a histogram method is the simplest method to get the magnetic spectrum of a quasi-1d system .",
    "it is also very efficient if the complete energy range has to be calculated .",
    "starting from a periodic hamiltonian of the form : @xmath134 one can use bloch theorem to get an effective hamiltonian : @xmath135 where @xmath106 is the length of the unit cell . numerically scanning the 1d brillouin zone @xmath136 with a uniform distribution",
    ", one can now diagonalize the finite matrix @xmath137 for each value @xmath138 .",
    "the resulting eigenvalues from this diagonalization are counted in a linear histogram over the full energy range and normalized to the total number of states .",
    "depending on the resolution of the @xmath138 sampling , this histogram will become an arbitrarily good approximation to the density of states .",
    "figures [ fig : firstplot ] , [ fig : chirality ] , [ fig : diameter ] ( cnt panels ) , [ fig : grapheneribbon ] , and [ fig : dwcnt ] were calculated using this method .    the calculation of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : lowfield ] was heavily optimized by using an adaptive @xmath138 sampling in combination with a linear interpolation to reduce the number of diagonalizations in regions of smooth band structure and increase the precision at band edges .",
    "another , more flexible method is that using green functions : the bulk green function @xmath139 of the infinite cnt can be calculated very efficiently by the following method.@xcite      with each recursion , the length of the effective unit cell is now doubled by decimating out every second cell : @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 is a small positive numerical value , chosen smaller than the desired energy resolution but large enough to provide fast convergence and numerical stability .    convergence is reached for @xmath144 if @xmath145 for some matrix norm @xmath146 and some small cutoff @xmath147 .",
    "we can then retrieve the bulk green function from the converged @xmath148 as : @xmath149    with the original hamiltonian ( [ eqn : periodic - hamiltonian ] ) expressed in a @xmath0-orbital tight - binding basis , the resulting green function @xmath150 is a matrix in the same atomic basis of one unit cell .",

    "[ fig : explain ] .",
    "the green function method and the histogram method both give numerical approximations to the same mathematical quantity , but their numerical errors are very different : while the former method tends to give fluctuations that show up as grainy structure in flat areas of the butterfly plot , the latter suffers from sampling problems around van hove singularities .",
    "both errors have to be countered with very high resolution scanning and down sampling of the data .",
    "the data presented in the figures of this article typically took several hours to weeks of computation time on standard pcs [ intel(r ) pentium(r ) 4 , 3 ghz ] .",
