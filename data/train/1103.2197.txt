    "we have computed the cmb b - mode polarization power spectrum .",
    "we have found that the amplitude of the b - mode polarization from the aether vector can be larger than that from inflationary gravitational waves with @xmath232 on small angular scales , which would be measurable with near future cmb probes .",

    "in this appendix , we summarize the existing observational constraints on the aether parameters @xmath233 , following @xcite .      parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters in the ea theory have already been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "two ppn parameters , the eddington - robertson - schiff parameters @xmath234 and @xmath235 , are identical to those in pure gr  @xcite . the whitehead parameter , @xmath236 , which characterizes a peculiar sort of three - body interaction vanishes in the ea theory  @xcite , and the five energy - momentum conservation parameters @xmath237 and @xmath238 vanish because the theory is derived from a lagrangian .",
    "the aether defines a preferred frame , and its effect is encoded in the remained ppn parameters @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "the exact values of @xmath239 and @xmath240 are found in @xcite : @xmath241 the easiest way to pass the stringent observational constraints , @xmath242 and @xmath243  @xcite , is to set @xmath244 exactly to zero by imposing the conditions @xmath245 which is possible since ea theory has four free parameters @xmath246 . under these conditions ,",
    "all the ppn parameters in the ea theory coincide with those of gr .",
    "linear perturbations around the flat or frw metric have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "they concluded that quantum and classical stabilities of tensors ( spin-2 modes ) , vectors ( spin-1 ) , and scalars ( spin-0 ) constrain the aether parameters to be @xmath247      the radiation damping rate in the weak field limit was first calculated in  @xcite , and then strong field effects are included in  @xcite .",
    "they found that in general the damping rate in the ea theory is different from that of gr .",
    "however , in the special case with @xmath248 , it is identical provided that the quadrupole coefficient of the radiation damping rate , @xmath249,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is equal to one .",

    "if the sound speed of each perturbation mode were smaller than the speed of light , then the ultra - high - energy particles would loose their energies into the mode in a similar way to cherenkov radiation .",
    "using this fact , elliott _",
    "et al_.  @xcite derived limits on the aether parameters . if all the aether modes propagate superluminally , we do not need to take into account their constraints .",
    "the conditions for superluminal propagation of tensors , vectors , and scalars are @xmath253 respectively .",
    "the connection between superluminality and violation of causality has been under debates  @xcite . since the above conditions together with the ppn vanishing conditions ( [ ppn - vanish1 ] ) and ( [ ppn - vanish2 ] ) are equivalent to the stability condition of scalar and vector modes , we here allow for the superluminal propagation in the ea theory .",

    "interestingly , the special combination @xmath259 is automatically satisfied , and we have @xmath260 imposing that the perturbations are stable and superluminal , we can restrict the two parameters within the range as @xmath261 for the parameters satisfying the above constraints , we have safely a cosmological solution ( see eq .",
