    "entanglement is the striking feature of quantum mechanics revealing the existence of nonlocal correlations among different parts of a quantum system .",
    "a pair of quantum systems is called entangled if the measurement on one of them can not be performed independent of that of the other .",
    "quantum entanglement is a resource for certain tasks that can be performed faster or in a more secure way than the classical correlation . for these reasons",
    "entanglement plays an essential role in quantum information , e.g. quantum computing @xcite , teleportation @xcite , cryptographic @xcite , dense coding @xcite and entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "these new aspects have launched intensive experimental efforts to generate entangled states and theoretical efforts to understand their structures .",
    "for instance , the entanglement between two qubits in an arbitrary pure state has been quantified by the concurrence @xcite , however , that of the mixed states has been given as the infimum of the average concurrence over all possible pure state ensemble decomposition .",
    "the closed form for the concurrence has been expressed by peres - horodecki measure @xcite . moreover ,",
    "this measure has been extended to include a bipartite system ab , with arbitrary dimensions @xmath1 and @xmath2 in an overall pure state @xcite .",
    "the latter technique has been used to treat the entanglement for the tripartite quantum system in a hilbert space with tensor product structure @xmath3 @xcite , e.g for the two - atom tavis - cummings model in an overall pure state .",
    "the interaction between the radiation field and the two - level atom , namely , jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) is an important topic in quantum optics since it is solvable in the framework of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) and it is experimentally implemented . also the jcm is a rich source for the nonclassical effects , e.g. the revival - collapse phenomenon ( rcp ) in the evolution of the atomic inversion @xcite and the generation of the cat states at one - half of the revival time .",
    "the importance of the jcm is increased as a result of the progress in the quantum information @xcite .",
    "the jcm has been generalized and extended in different directions @xcite .",
    "one of these directions , which is of particular interest , is the two two - level atoms interacting with a single quantized electromagnetic field ( tjcm ) .",
    "the atomic inversion of the tjcm exhibits rcp having forms different from those of the jcm .",
    "this quantity has been investigated when the field is initially prepared in coherent state , binomial state @xcite and displaced squeezed state @xcite .",
    "also the entanglement for the tjcm when the field is initially prepared in coherent state @xcite and binomial state @xcite have been discussed , too .",
    "the main object in quantum optics is to increase the nonclassical effects obtained from the quantum system .",
    "this has been achieved by developing new states beside the standard ones .",
    "one of these states is the displaced number state @xcite , which can be generated by passing coherent light through a non - linear medium @xcite . in the framework of the superposition principle the superposition of displaced number states ( sdn )",
    "has been developed as @xcite : @xmath4|m\\rangle\\\\ \\\\ = \\sum\\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty}c(n , m)|n\\rangle , \\label{bin1 } \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the displacement operator , @xmath6 is a real parameter where its value will be specified in the text , @xmath7 is the normalization constant having the form : @xmath8 and    @xmath9|m\\rangle .",

    "the generation of ( [ bin1 ] ) has been established by the so - called `` quantum state engineering '' .",
    "quite recently the decoherence for ( [ bin1 ] ) in the framework of the standard master equation , which is described by the phase insensitive attenuators or amplifiers , has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "also the superposition of the @xmath13 displaced number states @xcite and superposition of the squeezed displaced number states have been developed , too . finally , the density matrix @xmath14 of the superimposed states has two parts , namely , statistical - mixture part @xmath15 and interference part @xmath16 .",
    "the former provides information on the original components of the states and the latter gives the interference in phase space .    in the present paper",
    "we study the sdn against the two two - level atoms interacting with the quantized single - mode electromagnetic field ( tjcm ) . in the rwa",
    "the hamiltonian , which controls the system , takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the free and interaction parts of the hamiltonian , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the pauli spin operators of the @xmath22th atom ; @xmath23 is the annihilation ( creation ) operator denoting the cavity mode , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the frequencies of the cavity mode and the atomic systems ( we consider that the two atoms have the same frequency ) , @xmath26 is the atom - field coupling constant of the @xmath22th atom and @xmath0 is the transition parameter . in the paper we mainly deal with the ratio @xmath27 and",
    "consider two cases , namely , symmetric and asymmetric according to @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",

    "the object of this study is as follows .",
    "there are some well - known phenomena occurred for the jcm so that we see the possible occurrence of such phenomena for the tjcm and what would be the influence of the interference in phase space on the behavior of the system .",
    "also we quantify the entanglement between different components in the system .",
    "more illustratively , for jcm it has been shown that the schrdinger - cat state can be generated at one - half of the revival time .",
    "also this issue has been discussed only for the off - resonance tjcm when @xmath41 with @xmath42 in the framework of @xmath43 function @xcite . here",
    "we investigate this behavior for the resonance tjcm the most general case , i.e. for all values of @xmath44 , via @xmath39 function , which gives better on quantum system than @xmath43 function . in this regard  for the system under consideration",
    " we show that for the symmetric ( asymmetric ) case the asymmetric ( symmetric ) schrdinger - cat states can be generated .",
    "this behavior likely occurs at the quarter of the revival time .",
    "such generation of cat state is confirmed in the behavior of the @xmath40 .",
    "also we deduce the asymptotic form for the @xmath39 function in the strong - intensity regime .",
    "moreover , we shows that the degree of the entanglement is sensitive to the values of both @xmath0 , @xmath44 , and @xmath6 .",
    "specifically , the degree of entanglement for the asymmetric case is greater than that of the symmetric one , and the interference in phase space decreases the degree of entanglement .",
    "finally , for @xmath45 the evolution of the tangles can be connected by the behavior of the corresponding atomic inversion .",
    "the paper is organized in the following order : in section 2 we investigate the evolution of the @xmath46 , @xmath39 function and phase distribution . in section 3",
    "we investigate the entanglement between different components of the system . in section 4",
    "we summarize the main results .",
    "one of the basic quantities related to the jcm is the atomic inversion , which represents the difference between the population of the excited and the ground atomic states .",
    "the evolution of the atomic inversion is representative by showing rcp .",
    "the occurrence of the rcp in this quantity has a quantum origin since it indicates the granular structure of the initial field distribution and also reveals the atom - field entanglement .",
    "a lot of efforts have been done for observing the rcp experimentally . on the other hand , for the jcm",
    "it has been shown that there is a connection between the behaviors of the atomic inversion and both the @xmath39 function and phase distribution . in this section",
    "we discuss this situation for the tjcm and compare the obtained results with those of the jcm .",
    "also we investigate the influence of the interference in phase space on the behavior of the system .",
    "we start with the total atomic inversion , which can be evaluated for ( [ 10 ] ) as    = 5.5 cm +   +   +   +   + = 5.5 cm +   +   +   +   + = 5.5 cm    @xmath47 .",
    "\\label{13}\\ ] ]    for the symmetric case and in the strong - intensity regime ( sr ) , i.e. @xmath42 and @xmath10 has a smooth envelope .",
    "the relation ( [ 13 ] ) reduces to @xmath48 it is evident that this formula is quite similar to that of the standard jcm except the factor @xmath49 has to be unity .",
    "thus the behavior of the @xmath46 of the tjcm is quite similar to that of the jcm , i.e. the atomic inversion of the symmetric tjcm is insensitive of the existence of the other atom . in this case",
    "the revival time for @xmath50 , say , is @xmath51 .",
    "now we draw the attention to the @xmath46 of the asymmetric case ( see figs . 1 for given values of the interaction parameters )",
    ". also we have plotted the corresponding initial @xmath10 . from this figure",
    "one can see that when @xmath10 exhibits multipeak structure , e.g @xmath52 , the revival patterns in the corresponding @xmath46 are split .",
    "this is related to that each peak of @xmath10 provides its own rcp in the evolution of the @xmath46 , which interfere with those of the others to give such behavior .",
    "the comparison between the curves @xmath53 and @xmath54 in fig .",
    "1(a ) shows that the revival time of the initial cat states is approximately one - half of that of the initial coherent states and the locations of the symmetric and asymmetric revival patterns in the two curves are quite different .",
    "this can be easily realized by noting that each @xmath16 and @xmath15 has its own rcp .",
    "furthermore , the revival time of the former is the two times smaller than that of the latter",
    ". therefore , when the revival patterns contributed by @xmath16 and @xmath15 occur at the same interaction time asymmetric patterns are exhibited in @xmath46 .",
    "this behavior is completely different from that of the symmetric case , which we have not presented .    as is well known that for the jcm the evolution of the @xmath39 function @xcite as well as the @xmath43 function provides information on the rcp in the @xmath46 .",
    "more illustratively , as the interaction is going on , the @xmath39 function , which is initially presented by shifted gaussian peak , splits into two peaks counter - rotate on a circle in the complex plane of the distribution with interference fringes in between .",
    "as the interaction proceeds the two peaks collide at the opposite end of the circle having the initial form , they split again , and so forth .",
    "= 5.5 cm +   +   +   +   + = 5.5 cm +   +   +   +   + = 5.5 cm    in the framework of the @xmath46 : the collapse regions ( revival patterns ) in the rabi oscillations occur in the course of the splitting ( collision ) of the distributions of the @xmath39 function . in this regard ,",
    "the schrdinger - cat states are generated at the one - half of the revival time @xcite .",
    "also for the symmetric - off - resonance tjcm with the initial coherent light and using the @xmath43 function it has been numerically shown that asymmetric multipeak structure can be exhibited for @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the widths and the heights of these peaks can be controlled by the values of the detuning parameters and the type of the initial atomic states . in this part",
    "we investigate the evolution of the @xmath39 function for the tjcm when @xmath55 is relatively small .",
    "this is inspired by the facts that the @xmath39 function gives information on the quantum system better than @xmath43 function and the cat states generated for small @xmath55 are more nonclassical than those generated for strong initial intensity @xcite .",
    "additionally , we will deduce the asymptotic from for the state generated by the system when @xmath42 . the @xmath39 function for ( [ 10 ] ) can be easily evaluated as @xcite : @xmath56\\sqrt{\\frac{(n'+k)!}{(n+k ) ! } } { \\rm l}_{n'+k}^{n - n'}(2|z|^2)\\\\",

    "generally , we have noted for small values of @xmath55 that the entanglement between the two atoms through the bosonic system leads to that the initial form of the @xmath39 function can not appear again after switching on the interaction .",
    "for instance , for the symmetric case the single - peak structure coming from the leading terms ( cf .",
    "( [ i4 ] ) ) is dominant with distortion around circle in the @xmath59-plane ( see figs .",
    "2 ) . in figs .",
    "2 the values of the interaction time have been chosen from the evolution of the corresponding @xmath46 .",
    "comparison between figs .",
    "2(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) shows that the nonclassicality ( , i.e. the negativity ) is more pronounced when @xmath60 .",
    "additionally , the negative values in @xmath39 function at @xmath61 is much greater than those at @xmath62 , however , subsidiary peaks start to appear for the latter case",
    ". this will be remarkable in the behavior of the @xmath40 , as we will see below .",
    "now we derive the asymptotic form for the @xmath39 function for the case @xmath42 and @xmath63 using sr . in this case",
    "we can replace @xmath64 by @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the second and third terms in the curely brackets in ( [ 14 ] ) , respectively , and then apply the sr for the arguments of the trigonometric functions .",

    "when @xmath55 is very large @xmath72 and we can extract various facts from ( [ 14w ] ) .",
    "for instance , the interference part @xmath69 has no ( maximum ) contribution at @xmath73 . to be more specific , when @xmath61 the @xmath39 function reduces to that of the initial one , which is gaussian bell centered at @xmath74 , whereas at @xmath62 the initial bell splits into two typical peaks localized at @xmath75 and eventually at @xmath60 three - peak structure centered at @xmath76 with interference fringes in between",

    "moreover , we have checked the @xmath43 function for these values of the interaction times with @xmath42 and obtained number of peaks as those exhibited for the @xmath39 function .",
    "this behavior of the @xmath39 function is different from that of the jcm even though the evolution of the atomic inversion for the two systems is quite similar .",
    "this can be easily understood by comparing the generalized rabi oscillation for the jcm and the tjcm .",
    "actually , for the symmetric case the rabi oscillation of the tjcm is approximately two times greater than that of the jcm ( cf .",
    "( [ i4i ] ) ) .",
    "this fact explains why the cat states in the tjcm are generated at the quarter of the revival time , however , in the jcm at the one - half of the revival time . on the other hand ,",
    "we have plotted the @xmath39 function ( [ 14 ] ) for the asymmetric case in figs .",
    "3(b ) and ( c ) for the revival and collapse times , respectively , when @xmath77 .",
    "from these figures one can observe that the @xmath39 function exhibits symmetric shapes in phase space , which are in contrast with the the symmetric case ( see figs .",
    "the nonclassical effects are more pronounced in the course of the revival time , which also are greater than those occurred for the symmetric case ( compare figs",
    ". 3(b ) and ( c ) as well as figs . 3 ( b)-(c ) and figs .",
    "2 ) . furthermore , the shapes presented in figs .",
    "3(b)-(c ) indicate that the generated cat states are of the microscopic type .",
    "the @xmath39 function of the microscopic cat state exhibits a complicated shape resulting from that the contribution of the different components of the state are located close to the phase - space origin .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the microscopic cat state ( , i.e. @xmath55 is small ) provides more nonclassical effects than the macroscopic one @xcite ( compare figs .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) ) .",

    "i.e. for the symmetric case , one can see that in the course of the revival time the @xmath40 exhibits single - peak structure at @xmath84 .",
    "this behavior is close to that of the initial coherent light .",
    "nevertheless , at one - half ( quarter ) of the revival time two small lateral peaks ( wings ) occur .",
    "this indicates generation of the asymmetric cat states in the system .",
    "this behavior is not clear in the corresponding @xmath39 function ( see figs .",
    "it seems that the non - occurrence of the lateral peaks in the @xmath39 function is related to that @xmath55 is considerably small . in this case",
    "the contribution of the different components in the @xmath39 function will be close to the phase - space origin and destructively interfere with each others .",
    "furthermore , from the star - centered and bell - centered curves in fig .",
    "4(a ) ( , i.e. asymmetric case ) @xmath40 exhibits two - peak ( four - peak ) structure through the revival ( collapse ) time .",
    "in other words , two - component and four - component cat states can be generated in the asymmetric tjcm based on the values of the interaction parameters .",
    "this has been explained for the @xmath39 function as a generation of microscopic cat states .",
    "information on the interference in phase space is shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) for the asymmetric case . for the asymmetric case",
    "there are two forms of the revival patterns : one is smooth and the other is asymmetric . thus in fig .",
    "4(b ) we have plotted the @xmath40 for the first and second revival times .",
    "as is well known that for @xmath80 the @xmath40 of the cat state possesses single - peak at @xmath84 and two wings as @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "this form changes by switching on the interaction where in the course of the collapse time asymmetric eight peaks are created , which are transformed to symmetric four peaks at the first revival time and eventually are collapsed to two - peak structure at the second revival time .",
    "it is obvious that the shape of the peaks in @xmath40 includes information on the shape of the revival patterns , i.e. when the @xmath40 exhibits smooth peaks the revival patterns are smooth and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , the deformation in the @xmath10 leads to deformation in the peaks of @xmath40 ( see the star - centered curve in fig .",
    "also we have noted that when the values of the ratio @xmath44 changes the number of peaks in @xmath40 changes , too .",
    "furthermore , we have noted that the behavior of the case @xmath86 is similar to that of @xmath87 , however , for the former the peaks are always smooth and narrower than those for the latter ( see fig .",
    "4(c ) ) . also when @xmath88 the @xmath40 exhibits multipeak structure ( see the star - centered curve in fig .",
    "this situation is similar to that of the two - mode jcm @xcite .",
    "entanglement is at the heart of quantum information theory .",
    "various efforts are done to characterize qualitatively and quantitatively the entanglement properties of the quantum systems .",
    "this has been motivated by the progress in the experimental techniques aiming to create entangled states , which provide phenomena very different from the classical physics @xcite . in this section",

    "all these analytical facts are remarkable in fig .",
    "for the asymmetric case , i.e. the solid curve in fig .",
    "5(b ) , we obtain behavior as that of the symmetric case but the degree of entanglement is greater and the disentanglement period is @xmath119 .",
    "nevertheless , for this case it is difficult to obtain explicit forms for the state vector at @xmath97 .",
    "it is obvious that the disentanglement period depends on the value of the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "also the behavior of the @xmath102 is consistent with the occurrence of the rcp in the evolution of the corresponding @xmath120 , we have checked this fact . from fig .",
    "5(c ) one can see that for @xmath121 the bipartite are maximally entangled , however , for @xmath122 the degree of entanglement is decreased and the bipartite becomes periodically disentangled with period @xmath12 .",
    "this behavior is similar that of the purity of the jcm . finally , in fig .",
    "5(c ) we have plotted @xmath102 of the asymmetric case only where that of the symmetric case provides quite similar behaviors .      in this part",
    "we study the dynamical evolution for the tangle @xmath123 , which can be expressed as : @xmath124 [    \\\\ \\\\   + 2 c(n+k , m)c(n , m)c(n'+k , m)c(n',m ) [ x_1(n+k , t)x^*_2(n , t)+x_3(n+k , t)x_4(n , t ) ] \\\\ \\\\ \\times [ x_1(n'+k , t)x^*_2(n',t)+x_3(n'+k , t)x_4(n',t ) ] \\bigr\\}. \\label{en3 } \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have plotted @xmath123 in figs .",
    "6 for the given values of the interaction parameters .",
    "the obvious remark from these figures is that @xmath125 .",
    "this is completely different from the behavior of the @xmath102 ( compare figs . 5 and 6 as well as expressions ( [ en2 ] ) and ( [ en3 ] ) ) .",
    "this indicates that the degree of entanglement for the one - atom - remainder tangle is less than that of the field - atoms tangle .",
    "also this shows that the quantum entanglement can not be equally distributed among many different objects .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "we have an isolated system , i.e. the interaction with the environment is neglected , and hence the energy in the field and the two - atom system is periodically exchanged . in other words , when the @xmath0 photons are annihilated from the radiation field they are created , i.e. equally distributed , in the two - atom party and vice versa .",
    "this means that the energy included in the @xmath126 party is more than that in the @xmath127 party .",
    "actually , the entanglement is a direct consequence of the energy follow between the two parties .",
    "the rate of follow of energy in the bipartite of the @xmath102 is greater than that in the @xmath123 and this could be the origin in the difference between the evolution of the two tangles .",
    "now from the curves b and d in fig .",
    "6(a ) , i.e. symmetric case , one can observe that in contrast to @xmath102 the @xmath123 exhibits an oscillatory behavior in a good correspondence with the revival patterns in @xmath46 .",
    "also the interference in phase space decreases the degree of entanglement in the @xmath123 ( compare curves b and d ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the curve d is quite similar to that of the purity of the jcm ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) . for the asymmetric case , and from the curve a one can observe that @xmath123 exhibits compound behavior ,",
    "i.e. it includes periodic and oscillatory behaviors .",
    "also the bipartite can be approximately disentangled in the course of the first revival pattern . as in @xmath102",
    "the fock state increases the range of the oscillatory behavior in the @xmath123 ( see the curve c ) . from fig .",
    "6(b ) , which is given for the case @xmath86 , one can see that for the symmetric case the @xmath123 exhibits disentanglement periodically with period @xmath12 ( cf .",
    "( [ 11as ] ) ) as in @xmath102 and also includes oscillatory behavior .",
    "the @xmath123 of the asymmetric case ( , i.e. dashed curve ) provides two types of disentanglement long lived ( at @xmath128 ) and instantaneous ( at @xmath129 ) and they occur periodically with period @xmath119 . for the cases",
    "@xmath130 we have noted that the @xmath131 with periodic disentanglement only for the case @xmath122 .",
    "in this paper we have treated the system of two two - level atoms interacting with multiphoton single - mode field . the two atoms and the field",
    "are initially prepared in the excited atomic states and in the superposition of displaced number states , respectively .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of the atomic inversion , @xmath39 function , phase distribution and entanglement .",
    "we have shown that the tjcm can generate asymmetric ( symmetric ) cat states at quarter of the revival time for the symmetric ( asymmetric ) case . also this has been confirmed in the behavior of the phase distribution .",
    "moreover , we have deduced the asymptotic form for the @xmath39 function when @xmath42 .",
    "also we have noted that when the values of @xmath44 changes the number of the components of the generated cat state in the system changes , too .",
    "the @xmath40 exhibits multipeak structure for @xmath88 . for the entanglement",
    "we have investigated two types , namely , field - atoms and one - atom - remainder tangles .",
    "we have shown that the degree of entanglement in @xmath132 is much greater than that in @xmath133 .",
    "we have explained this in the framework of the rate of energy follow between different parties of the system .",
    "we have obtained the following facts related to entanglement .",
    "the degree of entanglement for the asymmetric case is greater than that of the symmetric one .",
    "the interference in phase space decreases the degree of entanglement .",
    "there is a similarity between the dynamical behavior of the @xmath102 and the purity of the jcm only for @xmath45 .",
