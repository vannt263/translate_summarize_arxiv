    "full characterization of quasi - monochromatic electromagnetic fields requires the knowledge of amplitudes and phases , which can be achieved by using homodyning detection techniques . these techniques , which belong to routine in radio - frequency analysis ,",
    "were brought to operation at optical frequencies @xcite and became popular since the discovery of phenomena generating fields with non - classical properties ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "they were used not only in the case of quasi - monochromatic light @xcite , but also in the case of definitely broadband fields , that is of pulsed fields @xcite . however , a simple information concerning the field amplitude such as a statistical information , for instance of the photon - number , is often sufficient and sometime crucial to understand light - matter interaction phenomena @xcite .",
    "it might be thought that measuring photon - number statistics is feasible only when very few photons are present in the field to be characterized @xcite .",
    "this prejudice stems from the notably poor photon - number discriminating capability of detectors , which hardly goes beyond five detected photons @xcite for detectors based on the photoelectric effect .",
    "many efforts have been made to achieve better photon - counting capabilities by working both on the detectors and on the front - end optics .",
    "multi - pixel detectors with single - photon sensitivity in each pixel , such as arrays of single - photon solid - state detectors @xcite , intensified ccd cameras @xcite and silicon photomultipliers @xcite , were ( are being ) shown to allow photon counting provided the light is spread across the sensitive area so that each pixel receives one photon at most .",
    "photons temporally spread by either cascaded arrays of beam splitters or multiple fiber - loop splitters have been alternatively used in connection with single - photon avalanche diodes @xcite .",
    "some of us showed that an on / off detector , that is a detector giving a standard current output as the response to any @xmath0 photon number , allows determining the whole statistical distribution of photons from the experimental probability of detecting zero photons at varying the detection efficiency .",
    "the technique , based on the application of a maximum likelihood algorithm , has been exploited to reconstruct both classical and quantum states @xcite .",
    "however , the method loses efficacy at increasing @xmath1 , nor the result improves if the detector has photon - number discriminating capabilities for @xmath2 @xcite .    in this work we use a hybrid photo - detector ( hpd ) , which is a photoemissive detector endowed with internal gain as it includes a photocathode and an avalanche diode .",
    "the pulse - height spectra of the output charge of this hpd exhibit separated peaks typically for @xmath3 photoelectrons .",
    "we perform single - shot measurements on ps - pulsed classical fields producing mean charge values from below to well above such @xmath4 values . from the converted voltages , @xmath5 , collected for thousands of measurements , we determine the ingredients of the fano factor of the voltages , _",
    "i.e. _ mean and variance of the @xmath6 distribution .",
    "we show that , if the detector is operated within its range of linear input / output response , we can retrieve @xmath7 from the experimental @xmath5-data without need of calibrating either the hpd or the electronics that processes its output . in the cases of relatively low intensities , in which the @xmath8 peak is sizeable ,",
    "we apply the algorithm cited above @xcite to reconstruct the statistical distribution of photons and find @xmath9 distributions in good agreement with the theoretical ones .",
    "it is noticeable that the method easily allows determining the statistical distribution of @xmath10 photons , that is in the mesoscopic regime , which has been scarcely explored for the above reasons .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section  [ sec : teo ] , we develop the theory that allows the retrieval of the detected - photon distribution , @xmath7 , from the experimental @xmath11 . in section  [ sec : exp ] , we check the theoretical results with experiments performed on a number of non - trivial classical fields with our hybrid photo - detector . for each type of field , in section  [ sec : onoff ] we reconstruct the distributions of the photon - numbers @xmath9 from the simple knowledge of the @xmath8 peaks of the distributions retrieved in section  [ sec : exp ] . in the conclusive section we present some perspectives of our method as one that allows determining photon - number statistics with linear non - photon - counting detectors .",
    "for any photo - detection experiment performed with an overall detection efficiency @xmath12 , the distribution of the number of electrons generated by the primary photon interaction that occurs in the detector , @xmath7 , is linked to that of the number of photons in the light under measurement , @xmath9 , by @xcite @xmath13 if we limit our analysis to the first two moments of the distributions , the link between the statistics of photons and that of the detected photons is given by @xcite @xmath14 in which @xmath15 is the mean value and @xmath16 is the variance .",
    "the same notation is adopted for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    in principle ,",
    "@xmath19 , that is the distribution of the photoelectrons is not necessarily the same as that of the photons . as a matter of fact",
    ", all the fields studied in this work are endowed with a photon - number distribution that is invariant under the convolution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phel ] ) .",
    "we will exploit this property to compare the experimental results with the corresponding theoretical distributions .    for photoemissive detectors ,",
    "in which the primary detection process is the photoelectric effect , @xmath4 is the number of photoelectrons emitted by the photocathode , which normally undergo multiplication before reaching the anode . for the linearity of the response , both the amplification internal to the detector ( gain ) and that of the electronics that processes its output , must be independent of @xmath4 . in the following",
    "we also adopt the strongly simplifying hypothesis that the spread of the single photoelectron peak in the final electronic output is negligible as compared to its mean value .",
    "under such an hypothesis , which is too weak to ensure photoelectron counting capability , the relation linking the statistics of the photoelectrons to that of the final voltage outputs , @xmath5 , is @xmath20 being @xmath21 a conversion coefficient describing the overall @xmath4-to-@xmath5 conversion process .",

    "<S> we theoretically demonstrate that detectors endowed with internal gain and operated in regimes in which they do not necessarily behave as photon - counters , but still ensure linear input / output responses , can allow a self - consistent characterization of the statistics of the number of detected photons without need of knowing their gain . </S>",
    "<S> we present experiments performed with a photo - emissive hybrid detector on a number of classical fields endowed with non - trivial statistics and show that the method works for both microscopic and mesoscopic photon numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained detected - photon probability distributions agree with those expected for the photon numbers , which are also reconstructed by an independent method . </S>"
