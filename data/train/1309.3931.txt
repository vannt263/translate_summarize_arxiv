    "<S> statistical complexity and fisher - shannon information are calculated in a of quantum scattering , namely the klein tunneling across a potential barrier in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the treatment of electron wave functions as masless dirac fermions us to compute these statistical measures . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of these magnitudes with the transmission coefficient through the barrier is performed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these statistical measures take their minimum values in the situations of total transparency through the barrier , a phenomenon highly anisotropic for the klein in graphene .    and    statistical indicators ; transmission coefficient ; klein tunneling ; graphene    the calculation of entropic measures in quantum bound states </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has revealed certain connections with physical properties , such as the ionization potential and the static dipole polarizability @xcite , the closure of shells @xcite and the trace of magic numbers @xcite in atoms and nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> the evaluation of these magnitudes for no bound states can have interest in scattering processes . </S>",
    "<S> a typical scattering process is the crossing of potential barriers by quantum particles @xcite , a situation which is found in many quantum phenomena , such as tunneling @xcite , interferences @xcite , resonances @xcite , electron transport @xcite , etc .    in a previous work @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the relationship of these entropy - information measures with the reflection coefficient in a potential barrier has been investigated . </S>",
    "<S> it has been put in evidence that these statistical magnitudes present their minimum values on _ the transparency points _ , just the situations in which the reflection coefficient is null and then the total transmission through the barrier is achieved .    following this line , we are also concerned in this work with the calculation of entropic magnitudes in the context of scattering processes through potential barriers , in particular with the so - called klein paradox @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is an phenomenon with counterintuitive consequences in relativistic quantum mechanics ( rqm ) that has deserved a great interest in particle , nuclear and astro - physics @xcite .    from the point of view of the non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( nrqm ) , we know that even if the energy of particles in the incident beam is less than the height of the potential barrier , some of the particles can trespass the barrier ( tunneling effect ) . </S>",
    "<S> the higher and wider the potential barrier is , less number of particles can go through the barrier ( exponential decay ) . </S>",
    "<S> klein @xcite showed that , in the frame of rqm , it is possible that all particles ( electrons in this case ) can cross the barrier , independently of how high and wide the potential barrier is . </S>",
    "<S> so , in this paradoxical context , it is possible to have situations of total transparency . </S>",
    "<S> this relativistic effect is explained as a consequence of the matching between electron and positron wavefunctions across the barrier , that allows the tunneling of the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of positrons inside the barrier can be understood as a result of the sufficiently strong potential of the barrier that is repulsive for the electrons but attractive for the positrons ( holes ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the klein paradox has never been realized in laboratory experiments due to the fact that huge electric fields , @xmath0 @xmath1 , are necessary for its observation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a possibility to observe this type of phenomenon that requires lower electric fields has recently been proposed and tested by means of graphene @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene is a new material with a promising potential for many technological applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is a monolayer of carbon atoms densely packed in a honeycomb lattice , so it can be considered a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system . in this material , electric fields of order @xmath2 @xmath1 , which are routinely created in realistic samples @xcite , are sufficient to check experimentally the klein tunneling for elementary particles @xcite .    from its electronic properties , </S>",
    "<S> graphene is a 2d zero - gap semiconductor with low - energy quasiparticles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these quantum particles can be viewed as massless relativistic fermions that exhibit , at low fermi energies ( @xmath3 ) , a linear dispersion relationship for their energy @xmath4 ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the planck s constant , @xmath7 is the quasiparticle momentum with @xmath8 the wavevector , and @xmath9 ( instead of @xmath10 for photons ) is the fermi velocity , @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> these low - energy quasiparticles can be described by the 2d dirac - like hamiltonian given by @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 are the pauli matrices .    in order to mimic a tunneling experiment in graphene similar to that proposed by klein , a two - dimensional ( @xmath14 plane ) square potential barrier @xmath15 is considered :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the height and width of the barrier , respectively , and the dimension along the @xmath19 axis is supposed to be infinite . </S>",
    "<S> this local potential barrier can be created by the electric field effect using local chemical doping or by means of a thin insulator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of this potential barrier is to invert charge carriers inside it , in such a way that holes play the role of positrons , or viceversa .    </S>",
    "<S> if an incident electron wave propagates under the action of the hamiltonian @xmath20 at an incident angle @xmath21 respect to the @xmath22 axis , the solutions in the different regions for the two - component dirac spinor representing these quasiparticles are :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the wavevector components outside the barrier , @xmath26 is the fermi wavevector , @xmath27 is a wavevector component inside the barrier , @xmath28 is the refraction angle , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the five amplitudes ( @xmath31 ) are complex numbers determined , up to a global phase factor , by the normalization condition and the boundary constraints , namely the continuity of the two components of the dirac spinor at @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> the scattering region ( region ii ) provokes a partial reflection of the incident electron wave . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection coefficient @xmath34 gives account of the proportion of the incoming electron flux that is reflected by the barrier . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for @xmath34 is : @xmath35 where in this case , @xmath36    in this process , there are no sources or sinks of flux , then the transmission coefficient @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this coefficient @xmath37 is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( dashed lines ) for two different heights @xmath17 of the potential barrier . </S>",
    "<S> observe the anisotropy of its behavior in the sense that apart of the normal incidence ( @xmath39 ) , the total transparency , @xmath40 , can also be found with other angles of incidence . </S>",
    "<S> this is just the paradoxical klein tunneling due to the fact that the fermi energy of the incident electrons is much less than the height of the barrier , @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation has been performed by taking for the electron and hole concentration , outside and inside the barrier , respectively , the typical values used in experiments with graphene ( see ref . </S>",

    "<S> these magnitudes are the result of a global calculation done on the probability density @xmath48 given by @xmath49 , taking into account that the region of integration must be adequate to impose the normalization condition in the two - component dirac spinor . as a consequence of having a pure plane wave in the @xmath19 axis , the density is a constant in this direction . </S>",
    "<S> then , without loss of generality , if we take a length of unity in the @xmath19 direction , the density does not depend on @xmath50 variable , @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the densities obtained for the different regions are :    @xmath52    to normalize these densities , the length of the integration interval in the @xmath53 direction is taken to be @xmath54 $ ] , @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] , for regions i , ii and iii , respectively .    the statistical complexity @xmath57 @xcite , the so - called @xmath58 complexity , is defined as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a function of the shannon entropy of the system and @xmath61 tells us how far the distribution is from the equiprobability </S>",
    "<S> here , @xmath60 is calculated according to the simple exponential shannon entropy @xmath62 @xcite , that has the expression , @xmath63 with @xmath64 some kind of distance to the equiprobability distribution is taken for the disequilibrium @xmath61 , @xcite , that is , @xmath65    , in region i and transmission coefficient , @xmath37 , through a @xmath42 nm . </S>",

    "<S> the dirac spinor is a pure plane wave in the @xmath53 direction due to the fact that there is not reflected wave , @xmath71 in expression ( [ eq - ro1 ] ) , then the density is constant and the complexity @xmath57 is the minimum , @xmath46 . for the values of @xmath21 in between the transparency points , there is reflected wave , @xmath72 in expression ( [ eq - ro1 ] ) , that interferes with the incident one giving rise to standing - like waves . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of any standing wave is @xmath73 , a value that also corresponds to the complexity of the eigenstates of the infinite square well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> observe that the points of total transparency are also well signalled by the minima of the statistical complexity @xmath57 .    in fig . </S>",
