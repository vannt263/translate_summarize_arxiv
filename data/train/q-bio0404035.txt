    "the mathematical modeling of the spread of epidemics is a subject of continuing theoretical and practical interest  @xcite .",

    "the time evolution of these variables is stochastic , e.g. , an infected individual at site @xmath0 has a certain probability per unit time ( rate ) @xmath1 to infect a susceptible individual at a neighboring site @xmath2 .",
    "these systems fall into the category of what mathematicians call interacting particle systems  @xcite and physicists call stochastic lattice gases  @xcite - systems of great interest also in the study of equilibrium phase transitions , phase segregation kinetics , etc .",
    ", fields very different from epidemiology and ecology .    the connection between these modes of description and various intermediate ones has been investigated extensively in recent years , e.g. , see  @xcite .",
    "mathematically this involves the use of the so called hydro - dynamical scaling limit .",
    "this uses a rigorous separation of space and time scales to derive deterministic macroscopic equations from the microscopic dynamics of stochastic lattice systems .",
    "other approaches are based on more heuristic methods such as the mean field approximation ( mfa ) and improvement thereof  @xcite    the present work falls in the latter category .",
    "we apply a pair approximation ( pa ) scheme to a microscopic stochastic epidemic model in which individuals recovered from an infection enjoy a period of immunity before again becoming susceptible at a rate @xmath3 : the sirs model .",
    "the pa approximation was used by durrett and levin  @xcite for the simpler susceptible - infected - susceptible  ( sis ) model where recovered individuals immediately become susceptible again .",
    "they compared the results of the pa and mfa with those of the stochastic sis model and found that the pa gave a quantitative improvement over the mfa . here",
    "we consider the general sirs model .",
    "we obtain the behavior of the stochastic model from extensive computer simulations .",
    "we then solve the pa and mfa models analytically for the stationary state and numerically for the time dependent case .",
    "we find that the pa gives considerably better agreement with the simulations than the mfa both for the time evolution and for the steady state . for the latter",
    "the pa reproduces the qualitative difference between the one and higher dimensional phase diagram of this model found in ref .",
    "this is reminiscent of the relation between the mfa and the bethe - peierls approximation  ( which the pa closely resembles ) for equilibrium lattice systems  @xcite .",
    "we first recall the stochastic lattice model of the sirs epidemic process  @xcite . a site @xmath4 of a @xmath5-dimensional lattice",

    "the system evolves according to the following transition rates , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of infected ( nearest ) neighbors of @xmath4 , @xmath1 is the infection rate , @xmath11 is the recovery rate and @xmath3 is the rate at which immunization ceases .",
    "the limit @xmath12 corresponds to the case where a recovered site passes instantaneously through the state @xmath8 ; this is the sis model , also known as the contact process .",
    "we shall choose time units in which @xmath11=1 .",
    "one can obtain some rigorous qualitative information about this and related models via probabilistic approaches such as those used in interacting particle systems  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the behavior of the stationary state on an infinite lattice which is a good approximation for the quasi - steady state behavior of large systems : see appendix  [ mcsimulation ] . .",
    "this information is encoded in the phase diagram of the stationary state which depends on the infection rate @xmath1 , the recovery rate @xmath3 and the topology of the lattice . for small @xmath1 ,",
    "the only stationary state is one in which all sites are in the susceptible ( disease - free ) state while for large @xmath1 there is ( for the infinite system ) also a stationary state containing non zero fraction of @xmath7 and @xmath8 individuals .    the critical infection rate @xmath13 is defined as the smallest value of @xmath1 , for a given @xmath3 , above which the infection can persist forever . for the sis or contact process  ( @xmath14 ) , the critical infection value is known with high accuracy , @xmath15 in @xmath16 and @xmath17 in @xmath18  @xcite . considerably less",
