    "modern power networks are increasingly dependent on information technology in order to achieve higher efficiency , flexibility and adaptability @xcite .",
    "the development of more advanced sensing , communications and control capabilities for power grids enables better situational awareness and smarter control .",
    "however , security issues also arise as more complex information systems become prominent targets of cyber - physical attacks : not only can there be data attacks on measurements that disrupt situation awareness @xcite , but also control signals of power grid components including generation and loads can be hijacked , leading to immediate physical misbehavior of power systems @xcite . furthermore , in addition to hacking control messages , a powerful attacker can also implement physical attacks by directly intruding upon power grid components .",
    "therefore , to achieve reliable and secure operation of a smart power grid , it is essential for the system operator to minimize ( if not eliminate ) the feasibility and impact of physical attacks .",
    "there are many closely related techniques that can help achieve secure power systems .",
    "firstly , coding and encryption can better secure control messages and communication links @xcite , and hence raise the level of difficulty of cyber attacks . to prevent physical attacks ,",
    "grid hardening is another design choice @xcite .",
    "however , grid hardening can be very costly , and hence may only apply to a small fraction of the components in large power systems .",
    "secondly , power systems are subject to many kinds of faults and outages @xcite , which are in a sense _ unintentional _ physical attacks . as such outages",
    "are not inflicted by attackers , they are typically modeled as random events , and detecting outages is often modeled as a hypothesis testing problem @xcite . however , this event and detection model is not necessarily accurate for _ intentional _ physical attacks , which are the focus of this paper .",
    "indeed , an intelligent attacker would often like to strategically _ optimize _ its attack , such that it is not only hard to detect , but also the most viable to implement ( e.g. , with low execution complexity as well as high impact ) .",
    "recently , there has been considerable research concerning data injection attacks on sensor measurements from supervisory control and data acquisition ( scada ) systems .",
    "a common and important goal among these works is to pursue the integrity of network _ state estimation _ , that is , to successfully detect the injected data attack and recover the correct system states .",
    "the feasibility of constructing data injection attacks to pass bad data detection schemes and alter estimated system states was first shown in @xcite . there",
    ", a natural question arises as to how to find the _",
    "sparsest unobservable _ data injection attack , as sparsity is used to model the complexity of an attack , as well as the resources needed for an attacker to implement it . however , finding such an _ optimal attack _ requires solving an np - hard @xmath2 minimization problem . while efficiently finding the sparsest unobservable attacks in general remains an open problem , interesting and exact solutions under some special problem settings have been developed in @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of a data injection attack is its impact on the power system .",
    "as state estimates are used to guide system and market operation of the grid , several interesting studies have investigated the impact of data attacks on optimal power flow recommendation @xcite and location marginal prices in a deregulated power market @xcite @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as phasor measurement units ( pmus ) become increasingly deployed in power systems , network situational awareness for grid operators is significantly improved compared to using legacy scada systems only . however , while pmus provide accurate and secure sampling of the system states , their high installation costs prohibit ubiquitous deployment .",
    "thus , the problem of how to economically deploy pmus such that the state estimator can best detect data injection attacks is an interesting problem that many studies have addressed ( see , e.g. @xcite among others . )    compared to data attacks that target state estimators , physical attacks that directly disrupt power network physical processes can have a much faster impact on power grids .",
    "in addition to physical attacks by hacking control signals or directly intruding upon grid components , several types of load altering attacks have been shown to be practically implementable via internet - based message attacks @xcite .",
    "topological attacks are another type of physical attack which have been considered in @xcite .",
    "dynamic power injection attacks have also been analyzed in several studies .",
    "for example , in @xcite , conditions for the existence of undetectable and unidentifiable attacks were provided , and the sizes of the sets of such attacks were shown to be bounded by graph - theoretic quantities . alternatively , in @xcite and @xcite , state estimation is considered in the presence of both power injection attacks and data attacks .",
    "specifically , in these works , the maximum number of attacked nodes that still results in correct estimation was characterized , and effective heuristics for state recovery under sparse attacks were provided .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate a specific type of physical attack in power systems called _ power injection attacks _ , that alter generation and loads in the network .",
    "a linearized power network model - the dc power flow model - is employed for simplifying the analysis of the problem and obtaining a simple solution that yields considerable insight .",
    "we consider a grid operator that employs pmus to ( partially ) monitor the network for detecting power injection attacks .",
    "since power injection attacks disrupt the power system states immediately , the timeliness of pmu measurement feedback is essential .",
    "furthermore , our model allows for the power injections at some buses to be `` unalterable '' .",
    "this captures the cases of `` zero injection buses '' with no generation and load , and buses that are protected by the system operator . under this model",
    "we study the open @xmath2 minimization problem of finding the sparsest unobservable attacks given any set of pmu locations .",
    "we start with a feasibility problem for unobservable attacks .",
    "we prove that the existence of an unobservable power injection attack restricted to any given set of buses can be determined with probability one by computing a quantity called the structural rank .",
    "next , we prove that the np - hard problem of finding the sparsest unobservable attacks has a simple solution with probability one .",
    "specifically , the sparsity of the optimal solution is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the `` vulnerable vertex connectivity '' that we define for an augmented graph of the original power network .",
    "meanwhile , the entire set of globally optimal solutions ( there can be many of them ) is found in polynomial time .",
    "we further introduce a notion of potential impacts of unobservable attacks .",
    "accordingly , among all the sparsest unobservable attacks , an attacker can easily find the one with the greatest potential impact .",
    "finally , given optimized pmu placement , we evaluate the sparsest unobservable attacks in terms of their sparsity and potential impact in the ieee 30 , 57 , 118 and 300-bus , and the polish 2383 , 2737 and 3012-bus systems .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secform ] , models of the power network , power injection attacks , pmus and unalterable buses",
    "are established .",
    "in addition , the minimum sparsity problem of unobservable attacks is formulated . in section [ secfeas ]",
    "we provide the feasibility condition for unobservable attacks restricted to any subset of the buses . in section [ secmin ]",
    "we prove that the minimum sparsity of unobservable attacks can be found in polynomial time with probability one . in section [ secnum ] , a pmu placement algorithm for countering power injection attacks",
    "is developed , and numerical evaluation of the sparsest unobservable attacks in ieee benchmark test cases and large - scale polish power systems are provided .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ secconc ] .",
    "we consider a power network with @xmath3 buses , and denote the set of buses and the set of transmission lines by @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively . for a line @xmath6 that connects buses @xmath7 and @xmath8 , denote its reactance by @xmath9 as well as @xmath10 , and define its _ incidence vector _ @xmath11 as follows : @xmath12 based on the power network topology and line reactances",
    ", we construct a weighted graph @xmath13 where the edge weight @xmath14 .",
    "the power system is generally modeled by nonlinear ac power flow equations @xcite . in this paper , a linearized model - the dc power flow model - is employed as an approximation of the ac model , which allows us to find a simple closed - form solution to the problem from which we glean significant insights . under the dc model , the real power injections @xmath15 and",
    "the voltage phase angles @xmath16 satisfy @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the _",
    "laplacian _ of the weighted graph @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 is positive which is typically true for transmission lines ( cf .",
    "chapter 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the power flow on line @xmath20 from bus @xmath7 to bus @xmath8 equals @xmath21 .",
    "we consider attackers inflicting power injection attacks that alter the generation and loads in the power network .",
    "we denote the power injections in normal conditions by @xmath22 , and denote a power injection attack by @xmath23 .",
    "thus the post - attack power injections are @xmath24 .",
    "we consider the use of pmus by the system operator for monitoring the power network in order to detect power injection attacks .",
    "with pmus installed at the buses , we consider the following two different sensor models :    1 .",
    "a pmu securely measures the voltage phasor of the bus at which it is installed .",
    "a pmu securely measures the voltage phasor of the bus at which it is installed , as well as the current phasors on all the lines connected to this bus .",
    "we denote the set of buses with pmus by @xmath25 , and let @xmath26 be the total number of pmus , where @xmath27 denotes the cardinality of a set . without loss of generality ( wlog ) , we choose one of the buses in @xmath28 to be the angle reference bus .",
    "we say that a power injection attack @xmath29 is _ unobservable _ if it leads to _ zero _ changes in all the quantities measured by the pmus . with the first pmu model described above",
    ", we have the following definition :    an attack @xmath30 is unobservable if and only if @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the @xmath33 sub - vector of @xmath34 obtained by keeping its @xmath35 entries whose indices are in @xmath28 .",
    "is a weighted laplacian matrix , the elements of @xmath36 sum to @xmath37 . ]    with the second pmu model described above , for any bus @xmath38 , it is immediate to verify that the following three conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "there are no changes of the voltage phasor at @xmath7 and of the current phasors on all the lines connected to @xmath7 .",
    "there are no changes of the voltage phasor at @xmath7 and of the power flows on all the lines connected to @xmath7 .",

    "thus , for forming unobservable attacks , the following two situations are equivalent to the attacker :    * the system operator monitors the set of buses @xmath28 with the second pmu model ;",
    "* the system operator monitors the set of buses @xmath43 $ ] with the first pmu model ,    where @xmath43 $ ] is the closed neighborhood of @xmath28 which includes all the buses in @xmath28 and their neighboring buses @xmath44 .",
    "thus , the unobservability condition with the second pmu model is obtained by replacing @xmath28 with @xmath43 $ ] in .",
    "wlog , we employ the first pmu model in the following analysis , and based on the discussion above all the results can be directly translated to the second pmu model .      in forming an unobservable attack ,",
    "an attacker generally has two objectives : minimize execution complexity and maximize its impact on the grid . note that these two objectives can be competing interests that are not simultaneously achievable .",
    "we will first focus on finding the minimum execution complexity for an attack to be unobservable , which constitutes the main part of this work . among attacks with the minimum complexity",
    ", we then find the one with the maximum impact .    for an attack vector @xmath29",
    ", we use its zero norm @xmath45 to model its execution complexity .",
    "this is because attackers are typically resource - constrained , and can choose only a limited number of buses to implement attacks . for minimizing attack complexity ,",
    "an attacker is interested in finding the sparsest attacks that satisfy the unobservability condition : @xmath46 since @xmath47 , a more compact form of is as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the complement of @xmath35 , and @xmath50 is the submatrix of @xmath51 formed by choosing all its rows and a set of columns @xmath52 .",
    "we now note that problem is np - hard : specifically , as a special case of the cospark problem of a matrix @xcite problem resembles a security index problem discussed in @xcite , which has been proven to be np - hard . under some special problem settings for data injection attacks , problems of this type",
    "have been shown to be solvable exactly in polynomial time @xcite @xcite @xcite . in general ,",
    "low complexity heuristics have been developed for solving @xmath2 minimization problems ( e.g. , @xmath53 relaxation ) .",
    "we now generalize our model to allow a subset of buses to be `` unalterable buses '' , meaning that their nodal power injection can not be changed by attackers .",
    "this allows us to model the following scenarios :    * a `` zero injection '' bus that simply connects multiple lines without nodal generation or load , and hence its power injection is always zero and can not be changed .",
    "* a `` protected '' bus by the system operator , and its power injection is not accessible by the attacker .",
    "we denote the set of unalterable buses by @xmath54 .",

    "generalizing , the sparsest unobservable attack problem is established as follows : @xmath56 when @xmath57 , reduces to .",
    "generalizing , eq . has the following equivalent form : @xmath58      _ given the locations of the sensors _",

    "it is then clear that the added dummy bus and lines in @xmath60 do not lead to any power flow changes in the network under any unobservable attack .",

    "this is because , as in theorem [ feasthm ] , we are interested in matrices that are _ submatrices of a graph laplacian _ : even with the edge weights of the graph drawn independently , the entries in these submatrices are _ correlated _ due to the special structure of a graph laplacian .",
