    "since the seminal work of @xcite , supernova - driven winds have been a favored mechanism for explaining the properties of low mass galaxies .",
    "modern theories of galaxy formation frequently invoke gas outflows ( or `` feedback '' ) to explain the lack of gas in dwarf spheroidals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the paucity of low mass galaxies compared to cdm simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hot gaseous halos around dwarf starbursts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    outflows may also be partially responsible for low metallicities in disk galaxies , particularly in low mass dwarf irregulars .",
    "for many years there has been evidence for a mass - metallicity relationship among galaxies , with low mass galaxies having systematically lower metallicities ( see figure  7 of the review by * ? ? ? * for an early plot of this relation ) .",
    "while some of the correlation between mass and metallicity is certainly due to less past enrichment in gas - rich low mass galaxies , some may also be due to a direct loss of metals through winds .    recently , after bringing abundance measurements to a common metallicity scale and fiducial radius , @xcite found a tight relationship between metallicity and galaxy mass . by combining measurements of the metallicity with estimates of the gas richness",
    ", he showed that galaxies systematically depart from the closed - box model of chemical evolution below a characteristic mass scale near @xmath3 .",
    "these results have since been qualitatively confirmed by @xcite , using an alternative abundance calibration , and by @xcite , using a much larger sample of metallicities from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , although with less accurate gas mass fractions .",
    "these results have widely been interpreted as evidence for the onset of strong galactic winds at a specific galaxy mass scale , below which gas and metals can easily escape the shallow potential well .",
    "although most theoretical attention has focused on outflow , infall is an equally appealing mechanism for producing low metallicities .",
    "outflow reduces the metallicity by preferentially driving metals out of a system , while infall reduces the metallicity by diluting a galaxy s interstellar medium ( ism ) with fresh , low metallicity gas .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the metallicity drops if rate of infall is higher than the rate of star formation , thus allowing the accreted metal - poor gas to dilute the ism faster than it can be enriched by evolving stars .",
    "given the very low star formation rates and star formation efficiencies seen in the majority of low mass disk galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , infall is therefore a viable mechanism for producing low metallicities in low mass galaxies .",
    "the conclusion that low mass galaxies have not evolved as `` closed - boxes '' is based on measurements of their effective yields .",
    "the effective yield measures how a galaxy s metallicity deviates from what would be expected for a galaxy that had the same gas mass fraction , but that had been evolving as a closed - box , i.e.  with no inflow or outflow of gas . a system that evolves as a closed - box obeys a simple analytic relationship between the metallicity of the gas and the gas mass fraction ( see reviews by pagel 1997 and tinsley 1980 ) . as gas is converted into stars , the gas mass fraction @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) decreases and the metallicity @xmath6 of the gas increases according to @xmath7 @xcite where @xmath8 is the true nucleosynthetic yield , defined as the mass in primary elements freshly produced by massive stars , in units of the stellar mass that is locked - up in long - lived stars and stellar remnants . for closed - box evolution , the metallicity increases without limit , and equals the nucleosynthetic yield when @xmath9 .",
    "equation  [ closedboxeqn ] assumes that the metals produced by a generation of stars are instantly returned to the ism and are well - mixed with existing gas .",
    "this `` instantaneous recycling '' approximation is likely to be valid for measurements of galaxies current gas - phase metallicities , which typically use oxygen abundances measured in hii regions .",
    "since the production of oxygen is dominated by winds and sn from massive stars ( @xmath10 ; see figures  5  &  7 from maeder 1992 ) , prompt return of oxygen to the local ism is a reasonable assumption .",
    "if a galaxy evolves as a closed - box , the ratio of @xmath11 should be a constant equal to the nucleosynthetic yield",
    ". however , this ratio will be lower if metals have been lost from the system through winds , or if the current gas has been diluted with fresh infall of metal - poor gas .",
    "one may therefore define the above ratio as the `` effective yield '' @xmath12 @xmath13 which will be constant ( @xmath14 ) for any galaxy that has evolved as a closed - box , assuming that the nucleosynthetic yield is invariant .",
    "in contrast , if any gas has either entered or left the galaxy , the measured effective yield will drop is a lower limit to the true nucleosynthetic yield . ] below the closed - box value of @xmath14 , due to changes in the metallicity @xmath6 and/or the gas mass fraction @xmath4 .",
    "the effective yield is therefore an observationally determined quantity that can be used to diagnose departures from closed - box evolution .",
    "unfortunately , low values of @xmath12 alone do not immediately reveal _ why _ a system has departed from closed - box evolution .",
    "either the addition of metal - poor gas , or the removal metal - rich gas could suppress the measured effective yield .",
    "it is therefore premature to assume that supernova - driven outflows alone can explain the low effective yields seen for galaxies with @xmath15 .",
    "this paper explores ways to distinguish between infall and outflow using the effective yield and the gas mass fraction . ",
    "[ effectiveyieldobssec ] summarizes the current observations of effective yields .",
    "calculations in  [ gasflowsec ] show how infall (  [ infallsec ] ) , outflow (  [ outflowsec ] ) , and the subsequent return to closed - box evolution (  [ evolutionsec ] ) change the effective yield and the gas mass fraction . a comparison with observational data in  [ pilyuginsec ] leaves metal - rich outflows as the only viable mechanism for producing the low effective yields observed in gas - rich galaxies .",
    " [ thresholdsec ] stresses the importance of high gas - richness in allowing enriched outflows to suppress the effective yield and suggests that the observed mass - dependent threshold in the effective yield is more closely linked to low star formation efficiencies than to the depth of the potential well .",

    "it is significantly larger than the @xcite sample , which is analyzed separately in appendix a , and has more accurate measurements of the gas content than @xcite .",
    "the effective yields in @xcite were calculated using gas - phase oxygen abundances measured from hii region spectroscopy using the `` @xmath16-method '' , developed in @xcite to match accurate oxygen abundances based on temperature - sensitive line ratios involving the weak [ ] @xmath174363 line ( `` @xmath18-method '' ) .",
    "the @xmath16-method was used to derive abundances in high metallicity ( @xmath19 ) `` upper - branch '' hii regions of spirals , and results in systematically lower metallicities than the more widely adopted @xmath20 method @xcite .",
    "the metallicities of irregulars compiled in @xcite were derived by @xcite using the @xmath18-method , or by @xcite using the @xmath16-method .",
    "all metallicities were interpolated from the observed radial metallicity gradients to a common galactocentric radius of @xmath21 .",
    "this fiducial radius will not occur at the same number of disk scale lengths in all galaxies , due to variations in galaxy surface brightness .",
    "since lower mass galaxies have lower surface brightnesses on average , their metallicities will be biased toward smaller radii and higher metallicities than the high mass galaxies in the @xcite sample .",

    "the effective yield data in figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] show three main trends .",
    "first , the effective yield increases with the dynamical mass of a galaxy , as measured by its rotation speed . as discussed in  [ introsec ] , this trend is typically interpreted as evidence for larger gas outflows in lower mass galaxies .",
    "second , the effective yield saturates at @xmath28 .",
    "i will adopt this as the true nucleosynthetic yield ( i.e.  @xmath29 ) throughout this paper find that true yields in the range @xmath30 to @xmath31 also provide statistically equivalent fits to the data . ] .",
    "this yield is within the range of theoretical determinations of the oxygen yield ( see compilation in @xcite for a salpeter initial mass function ) , although it is perhaps on the low side .",
    "third , the galaxies with low effective yields are relatively gas - rich scatter points along the observed @xcite relation . ] .",
    "one uncertainty in the data shown in figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] is the appropriate value of @xmath4 .",
    "the equations of chemical evolution track a system where all of the gas is affected by enrichment .",
    "however , the existence of radial abundance gradients ( e.g.   * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implies that the entire gas reservoir of a disk galaxy does not necessarily participate equally in the chemical evolution of the system .",
    "thus , the gas that is enriched may only be a fraction of the total gas mass",
    ". this discrepancy may be particularly severe for dwarf irregulars , whose hi envelopes extend well beyond the optical radius of the galaxy .    to constrain the impact of the uncertainty in the appropriate gas mass , the small dashed lines in figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] show the locus of the effective yield and gas mass fraction if the appropriate gas mass is up to a factor of two times smaller than assumed .",
    "this correction reduces the effective yield , but not significantly .",
    "the small solid line is the equivalent locus if the stellar mass has been overestimated by up to a factor of two , due to uncertainties in the appropriate stellar mass - to - light ratio . in general , these uncertainties are much smaller than the range of @xmath12 and @xmath4 spanned by the data , and could not erase the trends seen in figure  [ pilyugindatafig ]",
    ". the uncertainty in @xmath4 does not affect the metallicity @xmath6 in equation  [ peffeqn ] , because the metallicity is determined locally within an hii region through an analysis of emission lines , and does not require knowledge of the total gas reservoir .",
    "if the true nucleosynthetic yield is roughly constant among galaxies , then the observational data in figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] indicate that gas flows must have reduced the effective yield . before performing detailed calculations",
    ", it is useful to explore how gas flows change the effective yield of gas - rich systems , which are the only ones observed with very low effective yields .    first , expanding the definition of the effective yield ( equation  [ peffeqn ] ) in terms of the gas mass @xmath32 , the stellar mass @xmath33 , and the mass @xmath34 in metals in the gas phase , gives @xmath35.\\ ] ]",
    "although @xmath12 was defined based on the closed - box model , it can be calculated for any system , even if @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are not related to each other according to a closed - box model .",
    "equation  [ peff2eqn ] therefore holds for any past star formation and gas accretion / outflow history .",
    "when the gas mass is much larger than the stellar mass , as seen in low mass late - type galaxies with low effective yields , a taylor series expansion of equation  [ peff2eqn ] yields @xmath36 at high gas mass fractions , the effective yield is therefore independent of how much gas is in the system .",
    "this result immediately suggests that accreting even large amounts of gas will make little change in the effective yield of a system that is already gas - rich .",
    "although the additional gas will indeed drop the metallicity of the system ( assuming the new gas is metal - poor ) , it will also increase the gas richness , and thus keep the system near the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath4 expected for a closed - box system .",
    "equation  [ peff_highfg_eqn ] also suggests that metal - rich outflows will have a significant impact on the effective yield in gas - rich systems .",
    "the effective yield is linear with the mass of metals in the gas phase for a gas - rich system , and thus any process which removes metals leads to an immediate drop in the effective yield .",
    "the gas - rich limit explored above agrees with the more detailed calculations below , which show that the response of @xmath12 to gas flows is generally insensitive to both inflows (  [ infallsec ] ) and unenriched outflows (  [ outflowsec ] ) , but is extremely sensitive to metal - rich outflows (  [ outflowsec ] ) .",

    "as expected , the drop in effective yield is largest for the most gas - poor galaxies .",
    "in no case is the drop in effective yield greater than 60% , even for the rather extreme gas accretion shown . in contrast , the data in figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] show nearly a factor of ten range of effective yield , immediately suggesting that infall alone can not be responsible for the low effective yields observed .",

    "[ outflowmathsec ]    to calculate the response of the effective yield to outflow , consider an `` impulsive '' gas loss event , i.e.  one that is not interleaved with any star formation or gas accretion , similar to the infall case considered in  [ infallsec ] .",

    "as shown in appendix  [ proofsec ] , the effective yield immediately following an impulsive outflow will always be larger than the effective yield that would result from a more general , continuous outflow driven by on - going star formation , assuming that both cases have the same initial and final gas mass fractions , and the same mass in the outflow .    to calculate the impulsive outflow s impact on the effective yield , first define the mass of gas lost due to outflow as @xmath39 and the mass of metals lost as @xmath52 .",

    "these variations are driven primarily by differences in the high mass end of the imf , as can be seen by considering the simplified case where all stars with @xmath95 are completely disrupted either through stellar winds or sn . in this case , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the mass fraction of stars in the specified mass range for a given imf .",
    "this estimate gives values of @xmath71 that are @xmath5030% lower than the full calculation .",
    "the fraction of mass in low mass stars varies by @xmath5015% ( @xmath98 ) for the various imfs considered , but the mass fraction of high mass stars varies by a factor of three ( @xmath99 , from the salpeter to the kroupa 2001 imfs , respectively ) .",
    "the variation in @xmath100 therefore drives the majority of the variation in @xmath71 among different imfs , more so than differences in the assumed metallicity or mass - loss model .",
    "current data tend to favor the shallower top end slope adopted by @xcite ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus i will adopt a value of @xmath101 for the remainder of this paper . if the true value of @xmath71 is higher , then larger entrainment factors would be needed to match the same outflow metallicity .",
    "note that even with this lower value of @xmath71 , the wind will be dominated by freshly produced metals for any reasonable value of @xmath4 ; only a system with @xmath102 would be sufficiently metal - rich for the returned metals to equal the fresh production , assuming that the stars driving the wind were formed recently ( i.e.  as for a type ii supernova - driven wind ) and have metallicities approximately equal the current gas - phase metallicity .",
    "thus @xmath103 will be greater than 1 for all reasonable gas fractions .      using equation  [ ratiofgoutfloweqn ] with the appropriate values of @xmath55 , figure  [ yieldratfig ] plots the ratio of final to initial effective yield as a function of the mass fraction of gas lost in the outflow ( @xmath43 ) for an unenriched outflow ( center panel ) and for a maximally enriched outflow with @xmath104 ( right panel )",
    ".    for unenriched outflows , there are two main results .",
    "first , unenriched outflows are most effective in reducing the effective yield of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "this trend is in contrast to infall , which causes the largest reductions in @xmath12 when galaxies are gas - poor .",
    "second , even for the most gas - rich galaxies , reducing the effective yield by a factor of ten requires nearly complete removal of the ism .",
    "thus , the effective yield is relatively insensitive to outflows that drive out the existing ism , except in the most extreme case of large gas losses ( @xmath10575% ) from very gas - rich systems .    for enriched outflows ,",
    "the situation is quite different .",
    "the effective yield is extremely sensitive to gas loss from gas - rich galaxies , and decreases without limit for even modest gas loss ( @xmath10610% ) .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath12 to outflow can also be seen in the central and right hand panels of figure  [ yieldfgasfig ] , for unenriched and enriched outflows , respectively . for galaxies with an initial effective yield of @xmath14 and a range of initial gas mass fractions ,",
    "these plots show how outflows reduce both the effective yield and the gas richness .",
    "similar to the infall models shown in the left panel , unenriched outflows produce only modest changes in the effective yield , even when half the gas is lost from the system .",
    "in contrast , enriched outflows easily produce dramatic drops in the effective yield , particularly for larger gas mass fractions .",
    "metal - enriched outflows are therefore the only viable mechanism for producing the extremely low effective yields seen in figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] . ",
    "[ pilyuginsec ] will discuss this point in more detail .",
    "gas accretion and gas loss are likely to be episodic processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "thus , while they may temporarily reduce the effective yield , they will likely be followed by periods of closed - box chemical evolution that alter the effective yield while decreasing the gas mass fraction .    to calculate the impact of any subsequent closed - box evolution , assume that a galaxy has an initial effective yield of @xmath107 immediately after gas accretion or gas loss .",
    "the gas mass fraction before the system returns to closed - box evolution is defined @xmath108 .",
    "when the galaxy returns to evolving as a closed - box , it will obey the equation for instantaneous recycling of a system with fixed baryonic mass : @xmath109 which shows that the gas - phase metallicity increases proportionally to the true nucleosynthetic yield as the gas mass decreases .",

    "equation  [ yeffpostfloweqn2 ] shows that when a galaxy returns to closed - box evolution its effective yield will increase back to the true nucleosynthetic yield as the gas mass fraction decreases .",
    "thus , if star formation is on - going , the reduction of the effective yield is temporary .",
    "this result has also been shown previously by @xcite in a more detailed study of nitrogen and oxygen abundance ratios during episodic infall .",
    "the return to closed - box evolution can also be seen in the chemical evolution models of @xcite .    to directly track the evolution of the effective yield and gas mass fraction , equation  [ yeffpostfloweqn2 ]",
    "can be rewritten @xmath115 where @xmath116 , a quantity that goes from 1 to 0 as star formation proceeds .",
    "equation  [ yeffpostfloweqn3 ] shows that the effective yield measured some time after the end of infall / outflow will always increase , by an amount that depends on : ( 1 ) how low the effective yield was after the flow stopped ; ( 2 ) how gas - rich the galaxy was ; and ( 3 ) how much the gas fraction has dropped due to subsequent star formation .",
    "figure  [ evolutionfig ] shows the change in @xmath12 and @xmath4 predicted by equation  [ yeffpostfloweqn3 ] , as a function of the initial gas mass fraction ( light to dark lines ) , and the initial postflow effective yield ( left , center , and right panels ) .",
    "these curves trace non - intersecting streamlines in the plane of @xmath4 and @xmath12 .",
    "the curves show the behavior expected from equation  [ yeffpostfloweqn2 ] , namely , that as gas converts into stars and the gas mass fraction decreases , the effective yield rises back toward the true nucleosynthetic yield expected for a closed - box model .    at very low effective yields ,",
    "the return to closed - box evolution produces a steep fractional rise in the effective yield , due to the linear increase in metallicity with star formation ( equation  [ dzdmeqn ] ) .",
    "slight decreases in the gas mass fraction due to star formation can drive the effective yield back up to large values .",
    "thus , galaxies will have difficulty maintaining a very low effective yield after infall or outflow has stopped .",
    "for example , if a galaxy has an effective yield of @xmath117 and gas fraction of @xmath118 , then converting just 25% of its gas into stars increases its effective yield by nearly a factor of ten .",
    "figure  [ evolutionfig ] therefore suggests an additional obstacle to producing a population of galaxies with very low effective yields .",
    "these systems must either experience continual infall or outflow , or they must have highly inefficient star formation to keep their gas fractions nearly constant and their effective yields low .",
    "i return to this point in  [ thresholdsec ] .",
    "figure  [ evolutionfig ] also helps to explain why massive spiral galaxies currently have high effective yields .",
    "spiral disks were probably once gas - rich @xcite , and thus must have once been more susceptible to reductions in their effective yields by metal - enriched winds than they are today .",
    "indeed , observations suggest that large scale outflows were common in massive galaxies at early times ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and the recent review by @xcite ) , and yet the effective yields of the likely descendants are high .",
    "figure  [ evolutionfig ] and equation  [ yeffpostfloweqn2 ] show that any reduction in the effective yield of a gas - rich precursor of a present day spiral must be temporary .",
    "as the gas - rich disk evolves to its present gas - poor state , its effective yield will rapidly increase back to the nucleosynthetic yield .",
    "thus , the current effective yields of spiral disks place only limited constraints on their past gas loss , unless one utilizes the limiting cases provided in appendix a. however , _ in situ _ measurements of @xmath12 at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could reveal evidence for an earlier period of outflow . at these redshifts ,",
    "spiral galaxies are much more likely to be gas rich , and thus will be more likely to show low values of the effective yield for a given amount of outflow .",
    "a comparison of the models shown in figure  [ yieldfgasfig ] to the central panel of figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] immediately suggests that neither gas accretion nor unenriched outflows can reduce effective yields to the low levels seen in low mass gas - rich dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "metal - enriched outflows are the only mechanism apparently capable of sufficiently reducing the effective yields .",
    "these conclusions are strengthened by factoring in the tendency of post - flow evolution to return galaxies to the true nucleosynthetic yield .",
    "i now compare each of the three gas flow models with the data in more detail .",
    "appendix  [ garnettsec ] contains an identical comparison with the earlier data from @xcite , reaching similar conclusions .",
    "the calculations presented in  [ infallsec ] show that there is an absolute minimum value of the effective yield that can be produced by gas accretion ( equation  [ mineqn ] ; figure  [ ratiominimumfig ] ) .",
    "gas - rich galaxies have the largest value of this minimum , making their effective yields essentially impossible to change by gas accretion .",
    "the existence of gas - rich galaxies with low effective yields therefore immediately proves that infall alone can not produce the necessary reduction in @xmath12 .    to show this limit",
    ", the left panel of figure  [ pilyuginfig ] reproduces the data points from figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] , superimposed with the minimum effective yield that can be reached via infall ( equation  [ mineqn ] ) at each gas fraction , assuming an initial effective yield of @xmath14 .",
    "clearly , all of the irregular galaxies and a few of the spirals ( ngc  598 , ngc  925 , and ngc  2403 ) have effective yields that are too low to be explained solely by infall .",
    "thus , outflows must have occurred during these galaxies evolution .    to demonstrate the limits of infall more clearly",
    ", the dotted loci in figure  [ pilyuginfig ] indicate how past gas accretion could have brought galaxies to their present values of @xmath12 and @xmath4 .",
    "these loci are based on the rather extreme assumption that the galaxies gas masses have doubled , and that the galaxies are being observed immediately after accretion , before any star formation has taken place . along these dotted lines",
    "the effective yield drops and the gas mass fraction increases as gas is added to a galaxy , moving the galaxy down to lower effective yields and rightwards toward higher gas mass fractions . however , even with these generous assumptions , none of these galaxies loci intercept the horizontal dashed line expected for closed - box evolution .",
    "thus , before the hypothetical gas accretion , some other process would have needed to suppress the galaxies effective yields below the expected closed - box value .",
    "infall alone is therefore incapable of producing the lowest effective yields .",
    "the only conceivable way that infall could produce gas - rich galaxies with effective yields below the minimum predicted by equation  [ mineqn ] is if the initial gas mass fraction were low and the amount of accreted gas large .",
    "however the data suggests that this possibility is highly unlikely , given that the required initial gas fractions are much lower than seen in any disk galaxy .",
    "for example , for infall to produce galaxies with @xmath119 , the galaxies initially must have had @xmath120 , which is typical of gas fractions in elliptical galaxies , not disks .",
    "moreover , a galaxy with such a low initial gas mass fraction would have a very high stellar metallicity , which conflicts with the low stellar metallicities derived for dwarf galaxies using broad - band colors and resolved stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this would also lead to a large metallicity difference between the gas phase and the stars ( although see @xcite and @xcite for a possible example of such an offset in the dwarf galaxy wlm ) .",
    "finally , the necessary accretion would have to be extremely large .",
    "for accretion to bring a galaxy with an initial gas fraction of @xmath121 up to a final gas fraction of @xmath122 , the galaxy s gas mass would have to increase by a factor of nearly twenty , and its baryonic mass would have to double .",
    "however , even this large amount of accretion would not lower the effective yield by the factor of ten needed to explain the lowest mass galaxies .",
    "infall onto a gas - poor system is also unlikely to produce low effective yields in disks that `` regrow '' around gas - poor bulges , lahtough they do meet the condition for significant gas accretion onto gas - poor systems ; subsequent star formation in the gaseous disk would have wiped out any temporary reduction in the effective yield , as shown in  [ evolutionsec ] .",
    "although the comparisons in figure  [ pilyuginfig ] prove that infall alone is not responsible for low effective yields , they do not necessarily imply that infall has not occurred .",
    "instead , the opposite is true . because the effective yield is insensitive to infall , gas accretion leaves little trace on the effective yield , particularly for gas - rich galaxies .",
    "the effective yields of gas - poor galaxies are potentially more sensitive to past infall ( e.g.  see the evolution loci in the upper left of figure  [ pilyuginfig ] ) .",
    "however , the spiral galaxies which dominate the gas - poor population of disks are also observed to have high star formation efficiencies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus should rapidly consume any accreted gas , driving their effective yields back up toward the nucleosynthetic yield ( figure  [ evolutionfig ] ) .",
    "the effective yields of both gas - rich and gas - poor disk galaxies are therefore unlikely to show _ any _ sign of past infall , even if it has occurred .    given that infall has been largely overlooked in recent years due to the pervasive theoretical focus on outflows , it is worth reiterating that the evidence for significant sustained infall of onto disk galaxies is substantial , and that infall of @xmath123 onto high mass galaxies is required ( 1 ) to solve the g - dwarf @xcite and k - dwarf problems @xcite , as originally suggested by @xcite ; ( 2 ) to provide proper relative abundances of different elements and an extended star formation history in the milky way ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in total",
    ", there is strong ancillary evidence for on - going gas accretion in both low mass irregular and high mass spirals , but no evidence can come from observations of the effective yield alone .",
    "the central panel of figure  [ yieldfgasfig ] shows that the effective yield is nearly as insensitive to unenriched `` blast wave '' outflows as to gas accretion .",
    "the only significant difference is that unenriched outflows have the opposite dependence on the initial gas mass fraction , causing larger drops in the effective yield for gas - rich galaxies . even at high gas mass fractions , however , the decrease in effective yield is still far too small to explain the range of effective yields seen in figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] .",
    "the central panel of figure  [ pilyuginfig ] shows this limitation clearly .",
    "the dotted loci show how the galaxies analyzed by @xcite could have arrived at their present gas mass fractions and effective yields by losing 25% of their ism in an outflow , in the optimistic case that all galaxies were observed immediately after outflow ceased , but before subsequent star formation drove their effective yields back to larger values .",
    "if a locus intercepts the horizontal line at the adopted initial yield of @xmath8 , then it is possible that unenriched outflows could have brought the galaxy off the expected closed - box evolution to its present position .",
    "however , even with these generous assumptions it is clear that all but one of the dwarf irregulars could not have had a closed - box effective yield before the hypothetical outflow started , and that some other process must have already reduced the effective yield .",
    "the central panel of figure  [ pilyuginfig ] shows that the effective yields of massive spirals are also unlikely to have been significantly altered by unenriched outflows .",
    "this result is not surprising , given the weaker response of the effective yield to outflow from gas - poor systems .",
    "as with the infall case discussed above , the data in figure  [ pilyuginfig ] should not be interpreted as evidence against unenriched outflows .",
    "indeed , the calculations in this paper suggest that a large fraction of a galaxy s ism can be removed without significantly decreasing the galaxy s effective yield . instead",
    ", the data should be interpreted as evidence that unenriched outflows alone can not be the cause of the low effective yields seen in low mass galaxies .",
    "having ruled out inflow and unenriched infall in  [ infallgarnettsec ]  &   [ unenrichedoutflowgarnettsec ] , the only possible mechanism that can significantly lower the effective yield is metal - enriched outflow , such as would be caused by direct escape of sn ejecta .",
    "the models in figure  [ yieldfgasfig ] show that the effective yields of gas - rich galaxies are extremely sensitive to even modest amounts of gas loss , provided that the ejected gas is metal - rich .",
    "an enriched outflow that removes less than a fifth of a galaxy s gas can drop the effective yield by more than a factor of ten , provided that more than half of the galaxy s baryonic mass is gaseous .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ pilyuginfig ] directly compares enriched outflow models ( equation  [ ratiofgoutfloweqn ] ) with the data . as in the other panels , the dotted loci trace how the galaxies could have reached their present position after driving a metal - enriched wind that expelled @xmath124% of the galaxies gas .",
    "unlike the other panels , however , the majority of the dotted lines intersect the closed - box effective yield , indicating that a modest amount of enriched outflow could have brought the galaxies effective yields from the true nucleosynthetic yield down to their present low values .",
    "moreover , because the outflow models calculated in  [ outflowsec ] give lower limits to the amount of reduction produced by more continuous outflows , it is possible that even weaker winds may be sufficient to produce the same reduction in @xmath12 ( for example , if the wind began when the galaxies had higher gas fractions , and then was followed or interleaved with star formation ) .    taken together , the various panels in figures  [ yieldfgasfig ]  &  [ pilyuginfig ] explain why there are few gas - poor galaxies with low effective yields .",
    "there are simply no viable scenarios capable of producing such systems .",
    "indeed , all three mechanisms explored in this paper leave the region with @xmath125 and @xmath126 vacant for any reasonable amount of gas accretion or gas loss .",
    "the dotted loci in figure  [ pilyuginfig ] assume that all galaxies have been observed immediately after infall or outflow .",
    "however , given the episodic nature of these processes , it is more likely that most of the galaxies are being observed in a more quiescent state , and are turning gas into stars without any significant gas flows .",
    "the galaxies are therefore more likely to have recently evolved as a closed - box .    to demonstrate how recent closed - box evolution could have brought the galaxies to their current effective yields , figure  [ pilyuginevolutionfig ] shows the data from @xcite along with dotted loci indicating their past effective yields and gas mass fractions , assuming that star formation has reduced their initial gas fraction by 5% to reach their present values .",
    "as expected from figure  [ evolutionfig ] , figure  [ pilyuginevolutionfig ] shows that galaxies with low effective yields are extremely sensitive to any subsequent star formation .",
    "if such galaxies have recently converted just a small fraction of their gas into stars , then their past effective yields must have been even lower than currently observed . maintaining low effective yields",
    "therefore requires either nearly continuous metal - rich outflows or extremely low star formation rates .",
    "the onset of low effective yields in low mass galaxies is usually interpreted as evidence for a mass - dependent threshold for mass loss by winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these scenarios ,",
    "the fraction of gas and metals that remain bound to a galaxy is assumed to be a strong function of the depth of the galaxy s gravitational potential well .",
    "low mass galaxies have shallow potentials , and thus should retain only a small fraction of their gas for winds whose energies excede the depth of the potential .",
    "for example , a simple scaling argument presented by @xcite suggested that galaxies with circular velocities of less than @xmath127 retain fewer than half of their metals .",
    "in contrast to this widely adopted picture , the results above ( and figure  [ yieldfgasfig ] in particular ) suggest that massive galaxies may also have expelled a large fraction of their gas .",
    "although these galaxies are observed to have high effective yields , they are also moderately gas - poor and thus their effective yields can never be significantly reduced by outflows .",
    "massive disk galaxies also have continuous , relatively high rates of star formation , and thus their effective yields rebound quickly from any temporary reduction .",
    "thus , the drop in the effective yield seen in galaxies with @xmath128 does not necessarily indicate that _ only _ these lower mass galaxies have experienced outflows .",
    "if massive galaxies have also driven strong winds , then the trend towards low effective yields is not necessarily due to increasing mass loss .",
    "instead , it can be due to low mass galaxies higher gas richness and @xmath4 is stronger than between either quantity and @xmath129 .",
    "] , which increases the sensitivity of the effective yield to mass loss .",
    "thus , even if all galaxies lost the _ same _ fraction of gas , the effective yield would be lower in dwarf galaxies , due to their systematically higher gas fractions .",
    "the actual dependence of outflows on galaxy mass is calculated below in  [ modelsec ] , after including variations due to gas richness , and is found to be much weaker than previously assumed .",
    "given that the gas fraction varies smoothly with rotation speed , why is there an apparent break in the relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath27 ?",
    "are there plausible mechanisms that could produce a transition at @xmath130 , other than a sharp increase in mass loss ?",
    "first , inspection of the left panel of figure  [ yieldfgasfig ] shows that @xmath12 responds non - linearly to the gas mass fraction for a fixed amount of outflow .",
    "small changes in @xmath4 produce much larger changes in @xmath12 .",
    "secondly , several groups @xcite have noted that below @xmath131 , disk galaxies have surface densities that lie entirely below the @xcite threshold for efficient star formation .",
    "their low star formation efficiencies would keep low mass , low surface density galaxies gas - rich , and would allow low effective yields to be maintained after they were established .",
    "these two effects could potentially produce a break in the relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath27 . by occam s razor",
    ", the coincidence of these two mass scales is strong circumstantial evidence that the variation in star formation efficiency , rather than potential well depth , is critical for producing the transition in the trend of @xmath12 with @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , only a galaxy that falls off the @xcite global schmidt law can realistically maintain low effective yields between episodes of outflow . to demonstrate the need for low star formation efficiencies , first assume that outflows are discrete events , separated temporally by @xmath132 . to maintain an effective yield of @xmath133 during the interval between outflows , no more than 2.5% of a galaxy s gas ( @xmath134 )",
    "must have converted to stars since the end of the last outflow , setting an upper limit to the star formation rate . for a galaxy that follows the schmidt law to have a star formation rate less than this upper limit ( @xmath135 )",
    ", its current gas surface density must be less than @xmath136 , which is several orders of magnitudes below what is typically observed .",
    "however , if a galaxy lies entirely below the @xcite star formation threshold , the gas surface density needed to suppress the star formation rate is much more reasonable .",
    "i have estimated the star formation law in this regime from figure  1 of @xcite as @xmath137 , which is drastically steeper than the schmidt law . assuming that galaxies with @xmath138 fall in this low star formation efficiency regime , they only require that @xmath139 to maintain low effective yields between outflow events . almost all late - type and/or lsb dwarf galaxies have gas surface densities below this threshold @xcite , and thus they should be capable of maintaining low effective yields in between episodes of outflow .",
    "given the possibility that the drop in star formation efficiency at @xmath140 is responsible for the transition in the effective yield observed by @xcite , it is worth re - examining several issues .",
    "first is the existence of the transition itself .",
    "@xcite based his claim of a transition on a plot of the logarithm of the effective yield against the rotation speed .",
    "his figure  4 showed a flat relationship with rotation speed above @xmath141 .",
    "however , when the effective yield is plotted against the logarithm of the rotation speed , as in figures  [ pilyugindatafig ]  &  [ garnettdatafig ] , the evidence for a sharp transition seems much weaker . there is little dynamic range at rotation speeds above @xmath142 , such that the data can be adequately fit by a single power - law , giving @xmath143 for the data in figure  [ garnettdatafig ] .",
    "statistically , however , functions that have a break in the slope ( such as a double power - law ) have lower @xmath144 values than expected for the addition of new parameters , suggesting that there is some change in the behavior of @xmath12 from low to high galaxy masses .",
    "the other remaining issue is the relative strength of the effective yield s correlations with gas mass fraction and rotation speed .",
    "if the gas fraction is more critical to setting @xmath12 than rotation speed , then @xmath12 should correlate more strongly with @xmath4 than with @xmath27 .",
    "the data in figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] shows scatter in @xmath129 versus @xmath4 that is 45% higher than in the plot of @xmath129 versus @xmath145 , initially suggesting that a galaxy s effective yield might depend more strongly on its mass than on its gas mass fraction .",
    "however , the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath4 is at least five times larger than the uncertainty in @xmath27 , and produces scatter that is nearly perpendicular to the mean relationship , as can be seen by the solid and dashed lines in the right two panels of figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] .",
    "this effect maximally broadens the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting higher uncertainties leave open the possibility that the actual trend with gas mass fraction and star formation efficiency is at least as strong as the trend with rotation speed .",
    "the previous sections suggest that : ( 1 ) only moderate mass loss of supernova - enriched material is necessary to explain low effective yields ; and ( 2 ) that there is unlikely to be a sharp increase in gas loss below @xmath146 .",
    "these points can be demonstrated with a simple model that calculates the outflows needed to explain the observed trends in effective yield .",
    "the model calculates the mass loss needed for a single outflow event to bring galaxies to their present gas mass fraction and effective yield , assuming that they initially followed closed box evolution . for a fixed entrainment factor",
    ", these assumptions give a strict upper bound to the mass loss needed to explain the observed effective yields , as shown in the second lemma of appendix  [ proofsec ] ; a more realistic extended outflow and star formation history would lead to effective yields lower than observed , for any gas loss greater than that calculated here .      to estimate the maximum mass lost as a function of galaxy rotation speed , the current gas mass fraction is parameterized as @xmath147 , with @xmath148 constrained to lie between zero and 1 .",

    "the @xmath144 minima for all @xmath152 between -2.5 and -2.3 are statistically equivalent , giving parameters for equation  [ yeffparameqn ] of @xmath153 and @xmath154 for @xmath155 , and @xmath156 and @xmath157 for @xmath158 . for these values",
    ", plots of equation  [ yeffparameqn ] are nearly indistinguishable over the range of rotation speeds where data exist .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath159 and @xmath160 for @xmath161 are used throughout this section , and are used for the curved line in the left panel of figure  [ pilyugindatafig ] .",
    "the model uses the equations in  [ outflowmathsec ] to derive the rotation speed dependence of the gas loss needed to produce the observed relations for @xmath148 and @xmath162 .",
    "the outflow is assumed to consist of @xmath39 of gas , a fraction @xmath59 of which is entrained gas from the ism , and @xmath163 of which is pure supernova ejecta ( equation  [ entraineqn ] ) .",
    "chandra observations of dwarf starburst galaxies by @xcite find entrainment fractions of @xmath164% , with the majority being less than 65% .",
    "@xcite argue that these entrainment factors are probably overestimates of the amount of ism mixed with the ejecta , and that the actual entrainment fractions are thus likely to be smaller .    as in  [ outflowmathsec ] , the metallicity of the supernova ejecta is assumed to be @xmath165 , with @xmath166 and @xmath161 .",
    "larger values of @xmath71 increase the enrichment of the outflow , and reduce the amount of outflow needed to remove sufficient metals .",
    "models with higher or lower adopted values of @xmath8 produce similar results for low rotation speeds , where the differences between the observed effective yields and @xmath8 are large .",
    "the models have larger differences at high rotation speeds , where the difference between @xmath158 and @xmath155 is a large fraction of the difference between the observed effective yields and @xmath8 .",
    "however , the resulting uncertainty in the actual gas and metal - loss at large galaxy masses remains less than a factor of two .",
    "theoretical determinations of @xmath8 currently give no help in resolving this issue , given the large spread of published values , and the strong dependence on the imf .",
    "figure  [ modelfig ] shows the resulting upper bounds on the fraction of baryons lost ( left panel ) and of metals lost ( right panel ) , for a series of entrainment fractions from @xmath104 to @xmath167 ( i.e.  from pure sn ejecta to pure blast wave outflows ) .",
    "as seen in the left panel , the fraction of the baryons lost rises monotonically toward low disk masses ( @xmath168 ) , but shows no sharp features indicative of a sudden onset of winds .",
    "the maximum fraction of baryons lost is never more than 15% for all entrainment factors",
    "less than 75% , and only reaches above 50% for unrealistically high entrainment factors ( @xmath169% , corresponding to mass loading of nearly a factor of 20 ) .",
    "there is also a relatively small range in the baryonic mass fraction lost by disks",
    ". the range could be as small as a factor of two if @xmath158 , and is unlikely to be larger than a factor of 6 - 7 ( i.e.  if @xmath155 ) .    given the lack of any obvious feature at @xmath131 and the generally modest overall gas loss implied by figure  [ modelfig ] , the idea that winds are dramatically more effective below some threshold in galaxy mass is not compelling .",
    "instead , mass loss from disks seems to be rather modest overall , and only weakly dependent on galaxy mass .",
    "these models therefore suggest that supernova blowout will not be an effective mechanism for eliminating baryons from low mass galaxies .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ modelfig ] shows that the fraction of metals lost from the galaxies is a stronger function of galaxy mass , rising steadily from 10 - 25% at @xmath170 , to 50 - 60% at @xmath171 , with little dependence on the entrainment fraction .",
    "thus , the fraction of metals varies by less than a factor of 5 over the entire disk galaxy population , and shows no sharp features at any particular disk mass .",
    "even with the larger fraction of metals lost from low mass galaxies , it is extremely unlikely that dwarf galaxy winds are responsible for enriching the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "weighting the curves in figure  [ modelfig ] by the baryonic mass function of galaxies indicates that the dominant source of metals and gas into the igm comes from the most massive galaxies , not the dwarfs .",
    "although low mass galaxies lose a larger fraction of their metals , the difference in gas loss is not sufficiently large to make up for their lower masses overall .",
    "such galaxies simply do not contribute enough to the mass budget of galaxies as a whole to have a significant impact on enrichment of the igm ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "although figure  [ modelfig ] confirms that there is some , albeit weak , dependence of outflow strength on galaxy mass , it remains premature to conclude that the physical mechanism driving the correlation is simply the depth of the potential well .",
    "there are many galaxy properties that correlate with galaxy mass , and some of these may be more fundamental in limiting the amount of metal - loss . the pressure and scale height of the cool ism and the maximum sizes of hii regions are known to vary with galaxy mass , and all may play some role in determining the structure and efficiency of an outflow .",
    "it is also not yet clear if the metals lost from the cool phase are truly lost from the galaxy , rather than kept in a bound hot phase .",
    "finally , the weak dependence of gas loss on galaxy mass in figure  [ modelfig ] is indeed a direct result of the of the correlation between gas mass fraction and rotation speed , as suggested in  [ thresholdsec ] .",
    "if one ignores this dependence and instead assumes a constant gas mass fraction characteristic of spirals , then galaxies with @xmath172 would have needed to lose nearly twice as much gas as calculated above , and galaxies with @xmath173 would have had to lose more than 90% of their gas . when the variation of gas mass fraction with rotation speed is included , the required mass - loss is significantly smaller .",
    "this paper has presented a series of calculations showing the impact that inflow (  [ infallsec ] ) , outflow (  [ outflowsec ] ) , and subsequent closed - box evolution (  [ evolutionsec ] ) have on the effective yield and gas mass fraction of galaxies .",
    "these calculations , and their comparison with observations (  [ pilyuginsec]-[modelsec ] ) , yield the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "there is a minimum effective yield that can be produced by gas accretion .",
    "the minimum is significantly higher than the effective yields observed in low mass galaxies .",
    "thus low effective yields can not be due to gas infall .",
    "outflows that drive out gas with the mean metallicity of the ism can only produce low effective yields if they remove nearly the entire ism .",
    "because the same galaxies that show low effective yields also show high gas fractions , outflows of unenriched gas can not produce low effective yields .",
    "outflows that consist primarily of escaped sn ejecta are extremely efficient at reducing the effective yield .",
    "metal - enriched outflow is therefore the only viable mechanism for producing galaxies with low effective yields .",
    "4 .   metal - enriched outflows are ineffective at reducing the effective yields of gas - poor systems .",
    "thus , only galaxies that have maintained high gas mass fractions will show depressed effective yields in response to outflow .",
    "only galaxies with inefficient star formation are capable of remaining gas - rich to the present day , and thus they are the only systems which can show significantly depressed effective yields . 5 .",
    "any star formation that takes place after gas accretion or gas loss will increase the effective yield back to the true nucleosynthetic yield expected for closed - box evolution .",
    "thus , only galaxies with inefficient star formation can maintain low effective yields long after infall or outflow has finished .",
    "points 4  &  5 suggest that in addition to the ability to drive winds , galaxies with low effective yields must also have high gas mass fractions and low star formation rates .",
    "thus , the drop in effective yield observed at @xmath131 ( @xmath174 ) can not be interpreted solely as a mass threshold for escape of sn - driven winds .",
    "more massive galaxies may have also experienced significant outflows , but will show no reduction in their effective yields due to their low gas mass fractions and efficient star formation . 7 .",
    "points 1  &  2 should not be taken as evidence that infall and unenriched outflows have not occurred .",
    "they only indicate that these two processes produce little noticeable change in a galaxy s effective yield .",
    "8 .   at high redshifts ,",
    "a larger fraction of galaxies are likely to be gas - rich .",

    "the calculations in this paper consider the impact of single `` impulsive '' episodes of chemical evolution on the effective yield .",
    "however , gas accretion , outflow , and star formation are likely to be continuous and interleaved . in this appendix ,",
    "i show that these impulsive cases are strict upper and lower bounds on the effective yield produced by more continuous chemical evolution models .",
    "the proof rests on three lemmas ( proved in  [ lemma1sec]-[lemma3sec ] ) governing how the effective yield changes when swapping the order of two sequential impulsive episodes : ( 1 ) star formation followed by gas accretion always produces a lower effective yield than gas accretion followed by star formation ; ( 2 ) star formation followed by gas outflow always produces a higher effective yield than gas outflow followed by star formation ; ( 3 ) sequential episodes of gas accretion and gas outflow produce identical effective yields , independent of the order of the two events .",
    "physically , the first lemma is true because gas accretion produces the largest drop in the effective yield of gas - poor systems .",
    "thus , if star formation occurs first , it reduces the gas mass fraction and increases the impact of the infall .",
    "similarly , the second lemma is true because outflows produce the largest drop in the effective yield of gas - rich systems .",
    "thus , the outflow s impact is largest if it occurs before star formation has reduced the gas - richness .    with these lemmas ,",
    "i show that for the accretion , outflow , and conversion into stars of fixed quantities of gas , the minimum effective yield is produced when impulsive outflow is followed by closed - box star formation and then followed by impulsive gas accretion .",
    "the maximum effective yield is produced when the order of these processes is reversed ( i.e.  infall , followed by star formation , followed by outflow ) .",
    "these extremes allow one to calculate the range of possible effective yields produced by an arbitrary star formation and gas flow history .",
    "assume that during some interval of time @xmath177 is converted from gas into stars , @xmath178 of gas is accreted along with @xmath179 in metals , and @xmath180 and @xmath181 of gas and metals are carried away by outflows . for the most general case , assume that there are no constraints on the rate and timing of when the gas is accreted or expelled , or on the rate and timing of when any new stars are formed , provided that the correct totals are reached at the end of the time interval .",
    "given this freedom , how can the timing of the infall , outflow , and star formation be adjusted to produce the maximum reduction in the effective yield at the end of the time interval ?",
    "an arbitrary continuous chemical evolution history can be approximated as an interleaved series of infinitesimal impulsive episodes of star formation , gas infall , and gas outflow , each of which produce changes @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 in the mass of gas , stars , and metals .",
    "this time sequence can be represented as @xmath187 where @xmath188 represents impulsive ( closed - box ) star formation of @xmath182 masses of stars , @xmath189 represents impulsive gas accretion of @xmath183 masses of gas along with @xmath184 masses of metals , and @xmath190 represents impulsive outflow of @xmath185 masses of gas and @xmath186 masses of metals .",
    "these events can be made arbitrarily small so that the sequence closely approximates a continuous chemical evolution history .",
    "however , they must obey mass conservation such that @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 .",
    "now consider reordering pairs in the series above .",
    "if some pair is reordered such that it produces a lower effective yield at that point in time , then all subsequent effective yields in the series will be lowered as well , since the final effective yield changes linearly with the initial effective yield ( equations  [ ratiofgeqn ] , [ ratiofgoutfloweqn ] ,  &  [ yeffpostfloweqn2 ] ) .",
    "thus , given some arbitrary star formation and accretion history , one can arrange a lower final effective yield by reordering any adjacent pair of @xmath194 and @xmath195 so that the gas addition occurs _",
    "after _ the star formation , or any adjacent pair of @xmath196 and @xmath195 so that the outflow occurs _ before _ the star formation .",
    "reordering pairs of infall and outflow episodes makes no change in the final effective yield .",
    "given the lemmas described above ( which are proved below ) , one can make the following re - orderings in the series above , switching the terms in brackets in each step : @xmath197 only in the bottom configuration are there no possible re - orderings that could produce a lower effective yield .",
    "this final sequence of outflow , followed by closed - box star formation , followed by infall therefore produces the minimum effective yield of any chemical evolution history that involves the same total gas masses as the first sequence .",
    "the above arguments also prove that the minimum effective yield that can be produced by infall of a fixed amount of gas is observed immediately after the infall ceases .    in the same vein ,",
    "the _ maximum _ effective yield that can be reached for a given change in the gas and stellar mass can be found by reordering the initial sequence such that each swap produces a _",
    "greater _ effective yield .",
    "the end point of that process is @xmath198 .",
    "this result also prove that the final effective yield for an arbitrary outflow history is always smaller than if calculated for a single impulsive outflow event .",
    "taken together , the results above prove that the effective yield produced by an arbitrary continuous chemical evolution history must lie between the two extremes of the impulsive outflow - sf - inflow case and the impulsive inflow - sf - outflow case .    the only possible complications in the above proof are if either @xmath199 or if @xmath200 for the minimum effective yield case .",
    "if so , there would not be enough gas and/or metals in the initial gas reservoir to support the outflow and subsequent star formation . in these cases ,",
    "the process of reordering to reach a lower effective yield would be limited by the need to maintain a positive gas mass at all times .",
    "however , the same principles apply , and an optimal reordering could be reached for the specific case under consideration .",
    "to prove that the effective yield is lower if @xmath195 of gas converts into stars before @xmath201 is accreted , consider two cases . in case  1 , the gas accretion occurs first , and is then followed by closed - box star formation . in case  2 , the same events occur in the opposite order .",
    "assume that the initial gas mass fraction and effective yield are @xmath4 and @xmath12 , respectively , and that the final gas mass fraction is @xmath202 .",

    "<S> galaxies are not `` closed - boxes '' . </S>",
    "<S> both gas accretion ( infall ) and winds ( outflow ) change a galaxy s metallicity and gas fraction , lowering the galaxy s effective yield ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> low effective yields are seen in galaxies with rotation speeds less than @xmath1 , and have been widely interpreted as the onset of supernova - driven winds below a characteristic galaxy mass . however , accretion of metal - poor gas is also a viable explanation for the low effective yields observed in low mass galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> analytic calculations presented in this paper prove : ( 1 ) that neither infall nor unenriched outflows can produce effective yields that are as low as observed ; ( 2 ) that metal - enriched outflows are the only mechanism that can significantly reduce the effective yield , but only in gas - rich systems ; ( 3 ) that it is nearly impossible to reduce the effective yield of a gas - poor system , no matter how much gas is lost or accreted ; and ( 4 ) that any subsequent star formation rapidly drives the effective yield back to the closed - box value . given that massive galaxy disks are systematically more gas - poor than low mass dwarf irregulars , these calculations imply that : ( 1 ) massive galaxies may have experienced substantial infall and/or outflow in spite of their high effective yields ; ( 2 ) only gas - rich systems can have low effective yields ; and ( 3 ) only systems with low star formation rates can maintain low effective yields in between episodes of mass loss . </S>",
    "<S> the drop in effective yield seen in low mass galaxies is therefore not necessarily due to the onset of supernova - driven winds . </S>",
    "<S> instead , it is likely due to the fact that galaxies with @xmath2 have surface densities lying entirely below the kennicutt star formation threshold , as previously noted by verde et al . and dalcanton et al . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting low star formation efficiency keeps these galaxies sufficiently gas - rich that their effective yields can be reduced by outflows , and keeps their effective yields low between episodes of gas loss . </S>",
    "<S> additional calculations confirm that there is no galaxy mass at which the metal - loss becomes dramatically stronger . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of baryonic mass lost through winds varies only weakly with galaxy mass , shows no sharp upturn at any mass scale , and does not require that more than 15% of baryons have been lost by galaxies of any mass . </S>",
    "<S> supernova feedback is therefore unlikely to be an effective mechanism for removing large amounts of gas from low mass disk galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the dependence between metal - loss and galaxy mass is sufficiently weak that massive galaxies dominate metal enrichment of the igm . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations in this paper are based on impulsive accretion , outflow , and star formation events that provide limiting cases for more arbitrary chemical evolution histories , as proven in an appendix . </S>"
