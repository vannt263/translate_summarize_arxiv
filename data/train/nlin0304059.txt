    "many biological and physical phenomena are due to a complex connectivity among complex elements ; feedback mechanism seems to be a suitable way to understand such phenomena ( see for instance @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the introduction of feedback through a control parameter leads to models involving global multiplicative coupling among maps .",
    "one of the most simple models can be given by using logistic maps .",
    "within this context , two - dimensional noninvertible maps with a global multiplicative coupling between one - dimensional logistic maps are of great interest .",
    "the understanding of their quite complex behaviour can be a first step in the understanding of dynamics in higher dimensional systems .",
    "previous works ( see @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) have already been devoted to such kind of maps . in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to complete the understanding of dynamics of model ( c ) given in @xcite .",
    "the considered model is the noninvertible two - dimensional map @xmath0 defined by : @xmath1    where @xmath2 is a real control parameter , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real state variables .",
    "the map  ( [ 1 ] ) includes a time asymmetric feedback .",
    "numerical studies show that the system  ( [ 1 ] ) is stable when @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "section 2 is devoted to recalls about fixed points of the map  ( [ 1 ] ) and their bifurcations .",
    "section 3 concerns critical manifolds .",
    "section 4 analyzes evolution of basins by considering crossing of basin boundary through critical curves . in section 5",
    "we explain evolution of invariant closed curve issued from a fixed point and giving rise to @xmath6 , then to chaotic attractor .",
    "as explained in @xcite , @xmath0 possesses at most five different fixed points : @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10    for @xmath11 , @xmath12 is an attractive node and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are saddle points on the negative side of the axes , x  axis being @xmath13 unstable manifold and y  axis being @xmath14 unstable one .",
    "when @xmath15 , @xmath16 . for @xmath17",
    ", @xmath12 is a repulsive node and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are saddle points , but located on the positive side of the axes , which are now @xmath13 and @xmath14 stable manifolds ( figures [ fig6][fig7 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath18 , @xmath12 undergoes a flip bifurcation and a period doubling cascade occurs when @xmath2 decreases .",

    "hopf bifurcation and becomes repulsive by giving rise to an attractive invariant closed curve ( @xmath25 ) ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the study of ( @xmath26 ) evolution .",
    "an important tool used to study non - invertible maps is that of critical manifold , which has been introduced by mira in 1964 ( see @xcite@xcite for more details ) .",
    "a non - invertible map is characterized by the fact that a point in the state space can possess different number of rank-1 preimages , depending where it is located in the state space .",
    "a critical curve lc , in the two - dimensional case , is the geometrical locus of points x in the state plane having two coincident preimages , @xmath27(x ) , located on a curve @xmath28 .",
    "it is recalled that the set of points @xmath29(x ) constitutes the rank ",
    "n preimages of a given point x. the curve lc verifies @xmath27(lc)@xmath30@xmath28 or t(@xmath28)=lc and separates the phase plane in two regions where each point has a different number of preimages ( k in one region and k+2 in the other one , k @xmath31 ) . for the map  ( [ 1 ] )",
    ", @xmath28 is given by the cancellation of the jacobian of the map .",
    "for the map  ( [ 1 ] ) , the critical manifold lc@xmath32 is given by four arcs ( figure [ fig1 ] ) : @xmath33 @xmath34    and the critical manifold lc by ( figure [ fig2 ] ) : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 let us call @xmath39=@xmath40 , @xmath39 is a cusp point of @xmath41 , indeed @xmath42 is constituted of two merged critical half straight lines ( @xmath43-\\infty,\\ \\frac{5\\lambda}{8}]$ ] ) , which explains the fact that , by crossing @xmath42 , one goes from @xmath44 area to @xmath45 one , or from @xmath46 to @xmath46 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "let us remark that @xmath47 .",
    "the lc curves separate the state space in different areas @xmath48 ( figure [ fig2 ] ) , where each point possesses @xmath49 distinct rank1 preimages .",
    "figure [ fig2a ] shows the state space as a foliated one , each sheet corresponding to the existence of a rank1 preimage .",
    "this foliation looks like those given for parameter plane , for instance in @xcite .",
    "previous representations of such foliation related to the existence of lc curves can be found in @xcite .",
    "the basin of an attractor @xmath50 is defined as the set of all initial conditions that converge towards an attractor at finite distance when the number of iterations of @xmath0 tends towards infinity .",
    "the set @xmath50 verifies : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we call @xmath53 the largest connected part of a basin containing the attracting set . in this section ,",
    "we study the evolution of basin of attractors when parameter @xmath2 is modified .",
    "the situations are shown in figures [ fig3 ] to [ fig17 ] . using the terminology and the results of @xcite@xcite ,",
    "our aim is to explain how basins become fractal , nonconnected or multiply connected in the case of  ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "* figure [ fig4 ] shows the first modification of the basin with the creation of a @xmath54 h , due to the crossing of @xmath55 through the basin boundary .",
    "the @xmath54 h is a rank1 preimage of the area @xmath56 , which is located inside @xmath46 , when @xmath2 increases from the value 1 .    *",
    "the second modification consists in a bifurcation @xmath57 @xmath58 when @xmath2 decreases from the value 1 .",
    "islands are created ( cf .",
    "figures [ fig6]-[fig7 ] ) after the bifurcation concerning the fixed points @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath2 decreases from the value 1 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , located on positive part of axes , go to negative part of axes ; the stable manifolds of these two saddle points is a part of the basin boundary ; when the two points are on the negative part of axes , a tongue is created in the area ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) of the state space and crosses through @xmath55 and @xmath42 curves to penetrate inside @xmath46 area , which is located above @xmath42 ; it gives rise to a sequence of infinitely many preimages of any rank of this part of the tongue : these are the islands , the basin becomes non connected .    *",
    "the third modification of the basin is due to a sequence of @xmath62 ( figures [ fig9]-[fig11 ] ) .",
    "the first aggregation occurs when @xmath55 and @xmath42 curves become tangent in points @xmath63 and @xmath64 at the basin boundary ( figure [ fig9a ] ) , rank1 preimages of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , correspond to the aggregation of two islands with the immediate basin .",
    "the other preimages of @xmath63 and @xmath64 give rise to other aggregations .",
    "this first aggregation is followed by infinitely many new aggregations due to tangencies between critical curves and the immediate basin boundary when @xmath2 decreases ; such phenomena are explained more precisely in @xcite .",
    "the important point to note is that a crossing between critical curves and basin boundary makes some domains change @xmath67 area , so it makes appear or disappear preimages of the considered domains .",
    "the sequence of aggregations is nearly finished in figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "the basin size increases when the parameter @xmath2 decreases and tongues corresponding to island ends disappear when crossing critical curves of different rank ( figure [ fig12 ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig13 ] , the basin boundary is smooth .",
    "when @xmath2 decreases , being negative , an inverse process gives rise to new appearance of tongues ( figure [ fig14 ] ) .",
    "* another modification corresponds to a bifurcation @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 , that means basin with holes inside .",
    "the appearance of these holes is also related to crossing of basin boundary through critical curves ; for instance , the hole in the middle of the basin in figure [ fig15 ] is due to the crossing of @xmath55 near its left extremum ; it makes appear an area in @xmath46 region and the preimages of any rank of this area gives rise to infinitely many holes inside the basin ; these holes accumulate along the basin boundary .",
    "when @xmath2 decreases , the size of holes increases ( figure [ fig16 ] ) .",
    "some holes can open and be changed in @xmath71 ( cf .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) , this is the case in figure [ fig17 ] , the basin boundary becomes fractal .",
    "this section is devoted to the study of evolution of attractors when @xmath2 increases .",
    "this evolution can involve relations with the attractor basin or homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations .",
    "* when @xmath2= 1 , the attractive focus undergoes a nemark ",
    "hopf bifurcation and becomes repulsive when giving rise to an attractive @xmath25 @xmath72 ( figure [ fig18 ] ) .",
    "oscillations appear on @xmath72 when it is tangent to the cusp point @xmath39 on @xmath42 ( figure [ fig19 ] ) . from @xmath73 , @xmath2 increasing , there is an alternation between existence of @xmath25 with oscillations , frequency lockings , cyclic chaotic behaviors , contact bifurcations with basin boundaries and single chaotic attractor .",
    "these results are consistent with the liapunov exponents values obtained in @xcite .",
    "we are going to explain what occurs regarding contact with basins of coexisting period3 attractors .",
    "* in the same time , two attractive period3 orbits appear simultaneously by a fold bifurcation , coexisting with two period3 orbits of saddle points ( figure [ fig19 ] ) .",
    "so , three different attractors coexist ; figure [ fig20 ] shows the basin of the @xmath25 and the basin of the two period3 attractors .",
    "when @xmath2 increases , the two period3 attractive cycles undergo a nemark ",
    "hopf bifurcation and become unstable by giving rise to two period3 attractive @xmath25 around them .",
    "figure [ fig21 ] shows the three different basins of the three coexisting attractors : in this case , two period3 @xmath25 and a period29 attractive cycle , which corresponds to a frequency locking for the @xmath25 .",
    "* when @xmath2 increases , the @xmath25 appears again ; curles arise , due to crossings of @xmath72 through critical curves , and involve auto  intersections of @xmath72 , the @xmath25 is then called a @xmath6 @xcite ( figure [ fig23 ] ) .",
    "the existence of curles changes the shape of the @xmath25 and generates contact with its basin boundary ; this implies the explosion of @xmath72 and makes it disappear .",
    "then , the basin of the former @xmath25 becomes part of the basin of the other attractors ( figures [ fig26 ] @xmath74 [ fig28 ] ) .",
    "* figure [ fig27 ] shows the separate basins of each part of the two period3 attractive @xmath25 , that means basins for @xmath75 are plotted .    *",
    "another contact bifurcation occurs , which involves the manifolds of the period3 saddle cycles , born by fold bifurcation .",
    "this contact creates a new attractor , by mixing the two former period3 @xmath25 ( figure [ fig29 ] ) .",
    "this new attractor evolves , undergoes frequency lockings , which give rise to the appearance of cyclic chaotic attractor ( figure [ fig30 ] ) ; curles appear on the attractor and it becomes a @xmath76 ( figures [ fig36][fig38 ] ) , then it becomes a chaotic attractor ; chaos becomes stronger and stronger ( figures [ fig43][fig44 ] ) .",
    "* the chaotic attractor disappears when a contact bifurcation occurs between the attractor and its basin boundary ( figure [ fig46 ] ) .",
    "complex behaviour of a two - dimensional noninvertible map with a multiplicative global coupling between one - dimensional logistic maps , including a time asymmetric feedback , has been analyzed .",
    "the different kinds of basin bifurcations which occur when the parameter is modified and the evolution of attractors issued from nemark ",
    "hopf bifurcation have been explained .",
    "the fundamental point , as previously obtained in two - dimensional noninvertible maps studies , is the position of basins and attractors , regarding critical curves .",
