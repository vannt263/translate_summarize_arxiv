    "modern studies of nuclear structure and dynamics are mostly based on _ ab initio _ calculations using realistic potentials . due to the complexity of the problem , it is clearly important to have benchmarks between different groups and different techniques in order to test validity of the existent codes , as well as to establish the numerical accuracy of the solutions . on its turn",
    "this may allow a meaningful comparison with experimental data and then serve as a probe on our current understanding of the nuclear dynamics .",
    "in particular , this program is well suited to be pursued in few - nucleon systems ( @xmath3 ) , where several well controlled numerical techniques have been developed .",
    "the interest in _ ab initio _ calculations has been renewed in recent years , i.e. after the advent of the theoretical framework of chiral effective field theory ( @xmath4eft ) , nowadays widely used to derive nuclear potentials and electroweak currents from the symmetries of qcd  the exact lorentz , parity , and time - reversal symmetries , and the approximate chiral symmetry  ( see , for example , refs .",
    "the test of these new potentials in few - nucleon scattering , where accurate measurements of several observables exist , will give very stringent and critical information .",
    "the three - nucleon system is thoroughly studied and for this case some very accurate benchmarks  @xcite exist .",
    "after this achievement focus has been set on the four - nucleon ( 4n ) sector . in first place , this system may serve as an ideal  theoretical laboratory \" to test our knowledge of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) and three  nucleon ( 3n ) interactions .",
    "in particular , the effects of the nn p - waves and of the 3n force are larger than in the @xmath5 or @xmath6 systems , and it is the simplest system where the 3n interaction in channels of total isospin @xmath7 can be studied . in second place",
    ", there is a number of reactions involving four nucleons which are of extreme importance for astrophysics , energy production , and studies of fundamental symmetries . as an example , the reactions @xmath8 and @xmath9 play a key role in the theory of big - bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "moreover , the potentials derived from @xmath4eft contain several unknown parameters  the so - called low energy constants ( lecs )  which have to be fixed by comparison with experimental data .",
    "this fitting procedure is usually brought forth in @xmath5 and @xmath6 systems , where accurate calculations can be performed since many years and abundant precise experimental data exist .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to test validity of these @xmath4eft potentials on independent data , which has not been included in the parametrization .",
    "the 4n system , containing several resonances which are not straightforwardly correlated with nn and 3n sector , presents an ideal testground .",
    "nowadays , the 4n bound state problem can be numerically solved with good accuracy .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite the binding energies and other properties of the @xmath10-particle were studied using the av8@xmath11  @xcite nn interaction ; several different techniques produced results in very close agreement with each other ( at the level of less than 1% ) .",
    "more recently , the same agreement has also been obtained considering different realistic nn+3n force models  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there has also been a rapid advance in solving the 4n scattering problem with realistic hamiltonians .",
    "accurate calculations of four - body scattering observables have been achieved in the framework of the alt - sandhas - grassberger ( ags ) equations  @xcite , solved in momentum space @xcite , where the long - range coulomb interaction is treated using the screening and renormalization method @xcite .",
    "also solutions of the faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) equations in configuration space  @xcite and the application of the hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) expansion method  @xcite to the solution of this problem have been reported  @xcite .",
    "in addition to these methods , the solution of the 4n scattering problem has been obtained also by using techniques based on the resonating group model  @xcite . for applications to @xmath12 systems ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .    in a previous work ,",
    "we have presented a benchmark calculation for low energy @xmath13 and @xmath14 elastic observables by using the aforementioned ags , fy , and hh techniques , and by employing different nn interactions  @xcite .",
    "nice agreement between the results of the three different calculations has been reported , only minor differences were observed for some small polarization observables .",
    "it has been concluded that the @xmath13 and @xmath14 elastic scattering problem can be nowadays solved with a good accuracy .    in the present paper , we extend the benchmark to @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering for energies where both channels are open but below the @xmath2 threshold .",
    "these calculations present new challenges and are rather complex since the two reaction channels are coupled and involve both total isospin @xmath15 and @xmath16 states .",
    "so far , only a few accurate calculations have been performed for these processes  @xcite . only recently",
    ", the ags method has been extended to the energy regime well above breakup threshold where the calculations become even more complicated due to nontrivial boundary conditions or singularities @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider the present benchmark as an important step in establishing our current capability to solve the @xmath17 scattering problem . moreover , our aim is also to provide a set of solid converged results which could represent useful benchmarks for future applications in @xmath17 scattering .",
    "the potential used in this paper is the n3lo500 model by entem and machleidt  @xcite , based on the @xmath4eft approach and derived up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "in addition to the desire of improving theoretical tools , it is important to note that for these reactions there exist a large amount of accurate experimental data , accumulated during the last 50 years . in particular , below the @xmath2 threshold there exist ( since many years ) several measurements of the @xmath0 elastic differential cross section  @xcite , @xmath1 elastic differential cross section  @xcite and total cross section  @xcite , and @xmath1 elastic analyzing powers  @xcite . regarding the @xmath18 charge exchange reaction ,",
    "there exist mainly measurements of the total cross section  @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath19 charge exchange reactions , there exist measurements of the differential cross section  @xcite and polarization observables  @xcite .",
    "therefore , another motivation of the present work is to compare theoretical predictions with this data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : methods ] , a brief description of the methods used for this benchmark is reported .  in section  [ sec : results ]",
    ", a comparison between the results obtained within the different schemes is shown and the theoretical calculations are also compared with the available experimental data .",
    "the conclusions will be provided in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this work three different techniques , namely the ags equations , the hh method and the fy equations , will be employed to solve 4n scattering problem and the results provided by the three approaches will be benchmarked .",
    "generalities common to the three methods will be discussed in this section , whereas technicalities proper to each technique will be presented separately in devoted sections .    in case of a two body clustering @xmath20 , the total energy of the scattering state in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system",
    "is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 is the relative momentum between clusters , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the mass ( binding energy ) of the cluster @xmath26 . clearly , in the case of a single nucleon @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath29 . in this paper , we limit ourselves to study the scattering for @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the deuteron binding energy .",
    "namely , we consider 4n scattering when the channels @xmath0 and @xmath1 are open , but the @xmath32 channel is closed .    in the following , @xmath33 will denote the particular asymptotic clustering @xmath20 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath34 @xmath35 will correspond to the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) asymptotic clustering .",
    "moreover , for example when discussing @xmath1 scattering , the observables will be calculated at a given neutron laboratory energy @xmath36 , corresponding approximately to @xmath37 .    for a given total angular momentum quantum number @xmath38 and parity @xmath39 , the information on the scattering observables is contained in the s - matrix @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) denote the initial ( final ) clustering type , relative orbital momentum and channel spin of the two clusters , respectively ( see below ) .",
    "each submatrix of the s - matrix representing a separate cluster is clearly no longer unitary .",
    "for example , the submatrix describing @xmath1 elastic scattering will be denoted as @xmath43 . for the @xmath44 channels ,",
    "submatrix @xmath45 is of dimension 1 and can be parametrized in the standard way @xmath46 for the other cases , @xmath45 is of dimension 2 and is conveniently parametrized as @xmath47 where the ( eigen)phase - shifts @xmath48 , the ( eigen)inelasticity parameters @xmath49 , and the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are real ( and @xmath53 ) .",
    "explicitly , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the ( right ) eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath56 associated to the two eigenvalues , the latter written as @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then , we parametrize @xmath59 .",
    "if the matrix @xmath60 would be unitary , one recovers the standard definition of mixing parameter @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 with @xmath64 real . on the other hand , with inelastic channels present , @xmath64 is complex .",
    "the ags equations @xcite for the four - body transition operators were derived assuming short - range interactions , but together with the screening and renormalization method @xcite , they can be applied also to systems with repulsive coulomb force .",
    "the isospin formalism enables the symmetrization of the ags equations @xcite in the 4n system , where there are only two distinct four - particle partitions , one of the @xmath65 type and one of the @xmath66 type , denoted by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . in terms of particles",
    "1,2,3,4 we choose those partitions to be ( 12,3)4 and ( 12)(34 ) , respectively .",
    "the corresponding transition operators @xmath69 for the initial states of the @xmath65 type , as appropriate for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 scattering , obey the integral equations @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the free resolvent , @xmath72 is the free hamiltonian , @xmath73 is the permutation operator of particles @xmath74 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the two - nucleon transition matrix derived from the potential @xmath77 , and @xmath78 are @xmath65 and @xmath66 subsystem transition operators with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the integral ags equations ( [ eq : uags ] ) are solved in momentum - space partial - wave framework . scattering amplitudes for elastic and charge - exchange reactions",

    "the `` core '' part of wave function @xmath88 describes the system in the region where four particles are close to each other and where their mutual interactions are strong .",
    "hence , @xmath88 vanishes in the limit of large inter - cluster distances .",

    "after this decomposition , the calculation of the matrix element in eq .",

    "the main sources of numerical uncertainties for this method could come from the numerical integration needed to compute the matrix elements of the hamiltonian and the truncation of the basis .",
    "it has been checked that the numerical uncertainty of the calculated phase - shifts related to the numerical integration is small ( around @xmath147 % ) .",
    "the nn interaction has been limited to act on two - body states with total angular momentum @xmath148 ( greater values of @xmath149 are completely negligible ) .",
    "the largest uncertainty is related to the use of a finite basis due to the slow convergence of the results with @xmath150 .",
    "this problem can be partially overcome by performing calculations for increasing values of @xmath150 and then using some extrapolation rule ( see for example ref .",

    "the calculations have been performed at @xmath159 mev and for the n3lo500 potential .",
    "for this wave the parity is negative , so only hh functions having @xmath153 odd have to be included in the expansion . as can be seen , the inclusion in the expansion of the `` core '' part of functions with @xmath160 is insufficient to obtain a reasonable estimate of these parameters .",
