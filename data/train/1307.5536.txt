    "it is well - known that the properties of vacuum state for a quantum field crucially depend on the geometry of background spacetime .",
    "closed expressions for physical characteristics of the vacuum , such as expectation values of various bilinear products of the field operator , can be found for highly symmetric background geometries only . on one hand",
    "these analytic results are interesting on their own and on the other , they help understanding the influence of the gravitational field on the quantum vacuum for more complicated geometries . from this perspective ,",
    "de sitter ( ds ) spacetime is among the most interesting backgrounds .",
    "there are several reasons for that .",
    "ds spacetime is the maximally symmetric solution of einstein s equations with a positive cosmological constant and , owing to this symmetry , numerous physical problems are exactly solvable on this background . in accordance with the inflationary cosmology scenario @xcite , in the early stages of the cosmological expansion our universe passed through a phase in which its local geometry closely resembles that of ds spacetime . during an inflationary epoch ,",
    "quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field introduce inhomogeneities which play a central role in the generation of cosmic structures from inflation .",
    "more recently , astronomical observations of high redshift supernovae , galaxy clusters and cosmic microwave background ries07 indicated that at the present epoch the universe is accelerating and can be approximated by a world with a positive cosmological constant . if the universe were to accelerate indefinitely",
    ", the standard cosmology would lead to an asymptotic ds universe .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate physical effects in ds spacetime for understanding both the early universe and its future .",
    "the interaction of a fluctuating quantum field with the background gravitational field leads to vacuum polarization .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on the field operator give rise to another type of vacuum polarization .",
    "these conditions can arise because of the presence of boundaries having different physical natures , like macroscopic bodies in qed , extended topological defects , horizons and branes in higher - dimensional models .",
    "they modify the zero - point modes of a quantized field and , as a result , forces arise acting on constraining boundaries .",
    "this is the familiar casimir effect ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "the particular features of the casimir forces depend on the nature of a quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold , the boundary geometry , and the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field .",
    "an interesting topic in the investigation of the casimir effect is its explicit dependence on the geometry of the background spacetime . in the present paper ,",
    "an exactly solvable problem with both types of polarization of the electromagnetic vacuum will be considered .",
    "we evaluate the two - point function for the field tensor and the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor induced by a conducting plate in @xmath4-dimensional ds spacetime .",
    "the corresponding problem for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter has been recently considered in @xcite and @xcite for flat and spherical boundaries respectively ( see also @xcite for special cases of conformally and minimally coupled massless fields ) .",
    "it has been shown that the curvature of the background spacetime decisively influences the behavior of vevs at distances larger than the curvature scale of ds spacetime . in another class of models with boundary conditions ,",
    "the latter arise because of the nontrivial topology of the space .",
    "the periodicity conditions imposed on the field operator along compact dimensions lead to the topological casimir effect .",
    "this effect for scalar and fermionic fields , induced by toroidal compactification of spatial dimensions in ds spacetime has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section we present a complete set of mode functions for the electromagnetic field defining the bunch - davies vacuum state in @xmath4-dimensional boundary - free ds spactime .",
    "then , these mode function are used for the evaluation of the two - point function of the electromagnetic field tensor . in section [ sec : plate ] we consider the geometry with a conducting plate .",
    "the corresponding mode functions for the vector potential are presented and they are used for the evaluation of the two - point functions .",
    "the latter are expressed in terms of the boundary - free two - point functions .",
    "then , we evaluate the parts in the vevs of the electromagnetic field squared and the energy - momentum tensor induced by the conducting plate .",
    "closed expressions for these vevs are derived and their asymptotic behavior is investigated near the plate and at large distances compared with the ds curvatures scale .",
    "the main results are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section we present a complete set of mode functions for the electromagnetic field in ds spacetime and then the two - point functions for the field tensor are evaluated .",
    "the two - point functions @xmath5 for both massive and massless vector fields in ds spacetime are obtained in @xcite by using the arguments based on the maximal symmetry . in @xcite ,",
    "the wightman two - point functions for massive and massless vector fields are investigated in 4-dimensional ds spacetime by making use of the construction based on analyticity properties offered by the complexified pseudo - riemannian manifold in which the ds manifold is embedded .",

    "<S> this two - point function is used for the investigation of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor in the presence of a conducting plate . </S>",
    "<S> the vevs are decomposed into the boundary - free and plate - induced parts . for the latter , closed form analytical expressions </S>",
    "<S> are given in terms of the hypergeometric function . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath1 the plate - induced part in the vev of the electric field squared is positive everywhere , whereas for @xmath2 it is positive near the plate and negative at large distances . </S>",
    "<S> the vev of the energy - momentum tensor , in addition to the diagonal components , contains an off - diagonal component which corresponds to the energy flux along the direction normal to the plate . </S>",
    "<S> simple asymptotic expressions are provided at small and large distances from the plate compared with the de sitter curvature scale . for @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> all the diagonal components of the plate - induced vacuum energy - momentum tensor are negative and the energy flux is directed from the plate .    </S>",
