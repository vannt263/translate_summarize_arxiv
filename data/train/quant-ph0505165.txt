    "being modified by the recoil motion and exchanging energies with one common pump field , the atoms will exhibit some kinds of self - organization behavior @xcite or dynamic synchronization @xcite which induces phase transitions in the relevant system @xcite@xcite .",

    "the coefficient @xmath94 of eq.([gainlimit ] ) shows here that when the damping rate @xmath95 is small enough and the evolution time @xmath96 , the intensity gain of the probe field will be extremely high in the neighborhood of @xmath97 , and thus results in a uniform discrete gain structure as shown in fig.2 simulated directly on eq.([eq2 ] ) .",
    "although the raman gain condition will not be changed if the higher harmonic components of eq.([fourier ] ) is included , except for a more complicated sum formula for eq.([eq6 ] ) , the height of the gain peak for a specific @xmath13 in fig.2 ca nt be interpreted by above analytical method . as shown by fig.2 , for example",
    ", the light amplification mostly for positive multiple of the trap frequency and approximately up to @xmath98 is still a problem .",
    "the further simulations only indicate that the light amplification for positive detuning is a feature owing to the red - detuned of the pump field from the atom frequency .",
    "however , this regular gain spectrum still can be developed as an efficient detection method to analyze the micro - trap potential formed by a local interference field .",
    "under the raman resonant condition @xmath97 , another ingredient that enhances the maximum gain of probe field is the synchronization of the atomic motion in the harmonic trap , which is indicated by the term of @xmath99 in eq.([gainlimit ] ) and can be demonstrated through a bunching of the atomic trajectories in the phase space . to some extent ,",
    "the present problem described by eq.([eq2 ] ) under the adiabatic approximation is similar to the famous kuramoto model of ensembles of coupled oscillators @xcite , in which the complex order parameter @xmath100 plays an equivalent role as that of the bunching parameter @xmath101 @xcite in the traditional carl system @xcite . for the complex order parameter",
    ", @xmath102 measures the phase coherence of all the oscillators and @xmath103 describes their average phase .",
    "a main result of kuramoto model is : when the coupling intensity ( in present model the coupling intensity is related to the rabi frequency , @xmath104 , of the pump field ) exceeds a certain threshold , the incoherent oscillators are mutually synchronized and @xmath102 grows exponentially . in present case , when the resonant conditions @xmath105 and @xmath82 are both satisfied , the long - time output gain of @xmath54 reduces to@xmath106 where @xmath107 } $ ] is the secular complex order parameter determined only by the atomic distribution in the phase space .",

    "resulting in an exponential growth of the probe field .",

    "are set uniform in a region of @xmath121 $ ] and the initial atomic momentum follows a gaussian distribution ( showed by fig.3(a ) ) with a thermal spread of width above recoil temperature ( about @xmath122 ) @xcite . before the increment of @xmath123 ,",
    "the atomic trajectories are almost ubiquitous in the phase space and , after a stable output of @xmath54 is established , most atomic trajectories converge into the antinode area ( around @xmath124 ) and the other ones into the node area ( around @xmath125 ) of a standing wave induced by an interference between the amplified probe field and the strong pump field , with its wavelength being defined by @xmath126 . the bunching positions of the most atomic trajectories into the antinode area are a clear result due to the red - detuned of the pump field @xmath127 in fig.4 .    according to more simulations ,",
    "we find that the amplification and the pattern formation of the atoms in phase space under the raman resonant condition are robust to other parametric values provided that the gas medium is operated on a far - off red - detuned region and the trap is strong enough @xcite . following above conditions the change of collective coupling constant @xmath128 in the resonant gain region will not qualitatively change the self - organization effect and the long time high cw gain output of this model .",
    "the experimental realization of above cw carl system can be carried out by loading the laser - cooled atoms into an overall magnetic trap or into a far - off detuned optical lattice .",
    "thereafter , the trap is displaced along its axis for about one light wavelength @xmath129 to trigger the atomic motion , and then the atoms are pumped by a strong red - detuned field .",
    "a gain of a seed probe field in the backward direction under the resonant conditions @xmath130 will be detected then .",
    "this process will be enhanced further by a collective behavior of the atoms due to the synchronization of their recoil motion under raman resonant condition .",
    "the strong pump field feeds the energy to the system ( excite the trapping oscillating mode by atomic recoil motion ) and the dipole force , generated by the interference of the probe and pump light , bunches the atoms into several groups to adjust them synchronically extracting kinetic energy from the trap mode into the probe field @xcite .",
    "this scheme will also present a clue to introduce a new configuration of free electron lasers ( fel ) where the high speed electrons are injected into a ( or an array of ) strong quantum trap ( e.g. quantum dots ) . by stimulating the electrons motion through electromagnetic field on the electrode with appropriate frequency",
    ", the high gain field with certain frequency will be generated when the electrons oscillate collectively in ( or through ) these quantum traps .    in conclusion , we have investigated the light amplification in a carl with the atomic center - of - mass motion influenced by an external harmonic potential . under appropriate parametric condition that the pump field is red - detuned from the atomic transition frequency , our results show that carl confined by a robust trap can give rise to a cw laser with a higher lasing gain than that of the carl in the free space . the optical gain profile as a function of the pump - probe detuning displays a discrete structure and another kind of atomic self - organization related to the light gain is demonstrated in the phase space .",
    "this work suggests a new way to promote a cw carl device with a higher gain and , perhaps , analogically implies a new configuration of fel .",
