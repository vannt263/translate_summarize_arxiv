    "the latter example resembles the situation in gr in many ways @xcite .    in a canonical formulation",
    "the problem becomes even more apparent , where the symmetries turn into constraints , and it is notoriously difficult to implement them correctly in the discretized quantum theory ( see also @xcite for a discussion ) . even in quantum gravity theories like lqg , which are inherently set out to capture the full continuum physics , the discretized nature of the constituents , i.e. the graphs , make the implementation of the constraint algebra rather non - trivial @xcite .",
    "+ in general , breaking of symmetries is , however , not ultimately tied to the discretization , but rather the approximation involved , i.e. by replacing spatial derivatives with differential quotients between neighboring lattice points .",
    "for instance in lattice qcd one ideally would want to construct a lagrangian which , although describing a theory on the lattice , still encodes the symmetries of the continuum theory @xcite .",
    "a lattice action which reproduces the same dynamics as the continuum theory and therefore also reflects the symmetries of the continuum limit is termed _ perfect action _ in that context .",
    "that perfect actions exist for asymptotically free theories follows from wilson s theory of renormalization group flow @xcite .",

    "we show how to construct improved actions in this case and analytically compute the perfect action , which regains the vertex displacement symmetry and hence reflects the dynamics and the symmetry of the continuum , albeit formulated on a regge triangulation .",
    "we also formulate improved actions for regge calculus in @xmath3 , and investigate some properties of its continuum limit , i.e. the corresponding perfect action .",
    "in particular we are able to show that the perfect action from the regge action , and the one obtained by using simplices of constant curvature instead of internally flat ones , coincide . in the language of renormalization group flow",
