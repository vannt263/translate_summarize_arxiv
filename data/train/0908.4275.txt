    "yang - mills equations in more than four dimensions naturally appear in the low - energy limit of superstring theories .",
    "furthermore , natural bps - type equations for gauge fields in dimensions @xmath12 , introduced in @xcite , also appear in superstring compactifications as the conditions for survival of at least one supersymmetry in low - energy effective field theory in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "some solutions of yang - mills equations on @xmath13 were found e.  g.  in @xcite but have infinite action for @xmath12 .",
    "one possibility for obtaining finite - action solutions for the yang - mills equations in higher dimensions is to consider them on spaces of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a reductive homogeneous space @xcite . on the other hand , dimensional reduction of the higher dimensional gauge theory appearing in the low - energy limit of superstring theories is necessary and a way of performing a dimensional reduction in our framework is well known .",
    "the procedure , referred to as coset space dimensional reduction ( csdr ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , is taking advantage of the fact that homogeneous spaces admit isometries .",
    "one can then define a gauge theory on the full space and require the fields to depend on the internal coordinates in such a way that they are invariant under a combined action of @xmath16-isometries and gauge transformations .",
    "doing this , the higgs and the gauge sector are unified naturally which is another nice feature of the theory . in this paper , we investigate the structure of @xmath17 yang - mills theories and the corresponding equations of motion as well as some solutions on spaces of the form @xmath14 .",
    "the factor @xmath18 in the product space stands for one of the four flat dimensions we live in .",
    "this is a simplification , which could be generalized to four - dimensional minkowski space , for instance .",
    "the anstze one chooses are @xmath16-equivariant which implements the dimensional reduction along the coset space .",
    "the gauge potential of the theory is given by a connection on a vector bundle associated to a specific principal bundle whose structure group determines the gauge group .",
    "if the gauge group @xmath17 is broken down to @xmath19 , also the gauge potential on the bundle decomposes in such pieces and in general for each block we get a number of higgs fields that are responsible for the corresponding breakdown @xcite .",
    "a physical interpretation of this situation is given in the context of type iia string theory where we can think of these subbundles to be @xmath20 coincident @xmath21-branes wrapping @xmath15 and the higgs fields being open string excitations between neighboring blocks of these @xmath21-branes @xcite .",
    "adding fermions allows to obtain a realistic model in compactification to four dimensions @xcite .",
    "what we are looking at , are @xmath17 gauge theories for different @xmath22 on the symmetric space @xmath23 as well as on the non - symmetric space @xmath24 .",
    "such theories are equivalent to quiver gauge theories and their @xmath0-equivariant anstze for the gauge fields were derived in @xcite .",
    "here symmetry breaking takes place and the resulting number of higgs fields depends on the chosen representation of @xmath0 which in our case is determined by the gauge group .",
    "first , for @xmath25 we take the anstze for a @xmath5 and @xmath6 gauge theory which contains two and four higgs fields , respectively , and derive the equation of motion for these fields .",
    "second , for @xmath26 we consider a @xmath8 gauge theory which involves three higgs fields and derive the field equations for them using a connection with non - vanishing torsion . in order to obtain solvable equations one needs to choose a specific value for the torsion",
    "finally , we turn our attention to the product space @xmath27 , and generalize the equivariant anstze from @xcite and @xcite to a @xmath28 gauge theory , where @xmath29 higgs fields are involved .",
    "then we derive the field strength and show that the yang - mills equations yield a system of @xmath29 coupled second order differential equations for the higgs fields .",
    "some novel solutions of these higgs field equations will also be constructed .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the equivariant dimensional reduction technique to ten - dimensional heterotic supergravity with internal six - dimensional coset spaces including a nearly khler background ( see e.  g.  @xcite )",
    ". it would be also interesting to generalize our solutions to such a general setting .",
    "in @xcite , theories on spaces of the type @xmath14 were considered for the case of @xmath16 coinciding with the gauge group of the corresponding yang - mills theory .",
    "in such a case only one scalar field enters into the @xmath16-equivariant ansatz for a gauge potential . in this paper",
    "we are going to consider theories where a breakdown of the original gauge symmetry group takes place and therefore more scalar fields get involved .",
    "these fields are interpreted as higgs fields that are responsible for the corresponding symmetry breaking via the higgs effect .",
    "note that @xmath16-equivariant anstze lead via dimensional reduction to quiver gauge theories @xcite .",
    "such anstze may become complicated expressions and their generic form @xcite is not easy to handle .",
    "their explicit form also depends on the chosen representation in the following way .",
    "let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be some highest weight irreducible representation of @xmath0 .",
    "then this representation is also a representation for a closed subgroup @xmath2 of @xmath0 which is no longer necessarily irreducible but decomposes as @xmath32 where @xmath33 are irreducible representations of @xmath34 or @xmath4 .",
    "the number of higgs fields in our theory then depends on the quiver diagram , containing as many vertices as irreps of @xmath2 exist , and is determined by the number of maps between these irreps induced by the corresponding lowering operators of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore a quiver diagram is simply based on the weight diagram of the corresponding @xmath0 representation . for the case of @xmath7 and @xmath35 , with @xmath36",
    ", we consider the case where each arrow stands for exactly one real - valued scalar field and therefore it is clear that the higher quiver representation we choose , the more higgs fields come into play .",
    "let @xmath37 be a rank @xmath22 hermitian vector bundle over the space @xmath38 , associated to an irreducible representation @xmath31 of @xmath0 , with the structure group @xmath17 .",
    "for the @xmath0-equivariant case one can generically write the corresponding associated vector bundle as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a rank @xmath20 bundle over @xmath18 and @xmath41 a bundle over @xmath42 having rank @xmath43 which is also the dimension of the corresponding irrep @xmath33 of @xmath2 .",
    "the gauge group for such bundles is broken as @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "an @xmath0-equivariant gauge potential on the bundle ( [ gen ansatz bundle ] ) is then given by a block - diagonal part and an off - diagonal one : @xmath46 the block - diagonal part may be written as @xmath47 where the size of the blocks @xmath48 depends on the dimensions of the @xmath2-irreps as well as of the rank of the bundle over @xmath18 . in our case",
    "we consider the bundle @xmath40 over @xmath18 to be of rank @xmath49 and the connection @xmath50 on @xmath18 to be flat .",
    "therefore , the part of the connection belonging to this bundle vanishes up to gauge invariance and we find @xmath51 with @xmath52 denoting the connection on the coset part of the product space",

    "the @xmath59 on the right hand side corresponds to the specific map that connects the @xmath60th and the @xmath61th vertex of the quiver and is the tensor product of maps between the corresponding bundles .",
    "this means @xmath62 where @xmath63 are maps connecting two @xmath2-irreps @xmath33 and @xmath64 containing the left - invariant basis of one - forms on the coset space , and @xmath65 are size @xmath66 higgs fields depending only on the coordinate @xmath67 on @xmath18 in @xmath1 . for our consideration ,",
    "as mentioned above , these are just real - valued scalar fields , one for each arrow of the quiver .",
    "to sum up , we are dealing with an @xmath0-equivariant associated vector bundle @xmath68 over @xmath14 defined as @xmath69 where @xmath30 and @xmath70 are finite dimensional representation spaces for the representations @xmath33 of the subgroup @xmath2 of @xmath0 .",
    "each term comes along with the structure group @xmath71 and hence the overall structure group is given by @xmath72 obviously depending on the chosen representation of @xmath0 .    the explicit construction of the quivers , their representation and the underlying @xmath0-equivariant gauge theories was done in @xcite .",
