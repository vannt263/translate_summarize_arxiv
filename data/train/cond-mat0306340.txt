    "many real - world technological , social and biological complex systems have a network structure . due to their importance and influence on our life ( recall ,",
    "e.g. , the internet , the www , and genetic networks ) investigations of properties of complex networks are attracting much attention @xcite . such properties as robustness against random damages and absence of the epidemic threshold in the so called scale - free  networks are nontrivial consequences of their topological structure . despite undoubted advances in uncovering the main important mechanisms , shaping the topology of complex networks , we are still far from complete understanding of all peculiarities of their topological structure .",
    "that is why it is so important to look for new approaches which can help us to reveal this structure .",
    "the structure of networks may be completely described by the associated adjacency matrices .",
    "the adjacency matrices of undirected graphs are symmetric matrices with matrix elements , equal to number of edges between the given vertices .",
    "the eigenvalues of an adjacency matrix are related to many basic topological invariants of networks such as , for example , the diameter of a network @xcite .",
    "recently , in order to characterize networks , it was proposed to study spectra of eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices as a fingerprint of the networks @xcite .",
    "the rich information about the topological structure and diffusion processes can be extracted from the spectral analysis of the networks .",
    "studies of spectral properties of the complex networks may also have a general theoretical interest .",
    "the random matrix theory has been successfully  used to model statistical properties of complex classical and quantum systems such as complex nucleus , disordered conductors , chaotic quantum systems ( see , for example , reviews @xcite ) , the glassy relaxation @xcite and so on .",
    "as the adjacency matrices are random , in the limit @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the total number of vertices ) , the density of eigenvalues could be expected to converge to the semicircular distribution in accordance with the wigner theorem @xcite .",
    "however , rodgers and bray have demonstrated that the density of eigenvalues of a sparse random matrix deviates from the wigner semicircular distribution and has a tail at large eigenvalues @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "recent numerical calculations of the spectral properties of small - world and scale - free networks @xcite , and the spectral analyses  of the internet @xcite have also revealed that the wigner theorem does not hold .",
    "the spectra of the internet @xcite and scale - free networks @xcite demonstrate an unusual power - law tail in the region of large eigenvalues . at the present time there is a fundamental lack in understanding of these anomalies .",
    "in order to carry out a complete spectral analysis of real networks it is necessary to take into account all features of these complex systems described by a degree distribution , degree correlations , the statistics of loops , etc . at this time",
    "there is no regular approach that allows one to handle this problem .",
    "our paper fills this gap .",
    "our approach is valid for any network which has a _",
    "local tree - like structure_. in particular , these are uncorrelated random graphs with a given degree distribution @xcite , and their straightforward generalizations @xcite allowing pair correlations of the nearest neighbors .",
    "these graph ensembles have one common property : almost every finite connected subgraph of the infinite graph is a tree . the tree is a graph , which has no loops .",
    "a random bethe lattice is an infinite random tree - like graph .",
    "all vertices on a bathe lattice are statistically equivalent @xcite .",
    "these features ( the absence of loops and the statistical equivalence of vertices ) are decisive for our approach .",
    "the advantage of bethe lattices is that they frequently allow analytical solutions for a number of problems : random walks , spectral problems , etc .",
    "real - world networks , however , often contain numerous loops .",
    "in particular , this is reflected in a strong `` clustering '' , which means that the ( relative ) number of loops of length @xmath8 do not vanish even in very large networks .",
    "nevertheless , we believe , that the study of graphs with a local tree - like structure may serve as a starting point in the description of more complex network architectures .    in the present paper",
    "we will derive exact equations which determine the spectra of infinite random uncorrelated and correlated random tree - like graphs .",
    "for this , we use a method of random walks .",
    "we propose a method of an approximate solution of the equations .",
    "we shall show that the spectra of adjacency matrices of random tree - like graphs have a tail at large eigenvalues . in the case of a scale - free degree distribution ,",
    "the density of eigenvalues has a power - law behavior .",
    "we will compare spectra of random tree - like graphs and spectra of real complex networks .",
    "the role of weakly connected vertices will also be discussed .",
    "let @xmath9 be the @xmath10 symmetric adjacency matrix of an @xmath7-vertex mayer s graph @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( the mayer graph has either @xmath14 or @xmath15 edges between any pair of vertices , and has no `` tadpoles '' , i.e. , edges attached at a single vertex ) .",
    "degree @xmath16 ( the number of connections ) of a vertex @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 a random graph , which is , in fact , an ensemble of graphs , is characterized by a degree distribution @xmath19 : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the averaging over the ensemble . we suppose that each graph in the ensemble has @xmath7 vertices .",
    "graph ensembles with a given _ uncorrelated _ vertex degree distribution may be realized , e.g. , as follows .",
    "consider all possible graphs with a sequence of the numbers @xmath22 of vertices of degree @xmath3 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , assuming @xmath25 in the thermodynamic limit [ @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "suppose that all these graphs are equiprobable .",
    "then , simple statistical arguments lead to the conclusion that almost all finite connected subgraphs of an infinite graph do not contain loops .    this approach can be easily generalized to networks with correlations between nearest - neighbor vertices , characterized by the two - vertex degree distribution : @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the total number of edges . in the case of an uncorrelated graph",

    "we define @xmath43 one can prove @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the shortest path from @xmath41 to @xmath17 .",
    "there is an important relationship : @xmath46 in this sum the vertex @xmath47 is the nearest neighbor of @xmath41 and a second neighbor of the vertex @xmath17 .",

    "we have @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",

    "wigner s law is valid for the eigenvalue spectra of real symmetric random matrices whose elements are independent identically distributed gaussian variables @xcite .",
    "these specific random matrices for wigner s law essentially differ from the adjacency matrices , which we consider in this paper .",
