    "the quest for exo - planets has attracted attention to stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "a complete understanding of their formation requires a quantitative and predictive description of stellar multiplicity .",
    "empirical data on stellar multiplicity serve as a benchmark for star formation theories , for example to compare with recent large - scale hydrodynamical simulations @xcite . although multiplicity statistics of solar - type dwarfs were assumed to be known since the survey of @xcite , in fact that survey did not constrain multiplicities higher than two because ( i ) the sample of 164 stars was too small and ( ii ) the discovery of wide binaries relied on traditional visual techniques .",
    "@xcite shows that @xcite missed half of higher - order multiples within 25pc from the sun .",
    "several studies of large samples of nearby stars are now in progress .",
    "radial - velocity ( rv ) techniques ensure a secure detection of all short - period stellar companions ( see summary in * ? ? ?",
    ". however , for wider separations ( @xmath8 10au ) rv variations are too slow or too small , and such companions are better discovered by direct imaging .",
    "several recent deep imaging surveys , summarized by @xcite , aimed to detect substellar or planetary - mass companions to nearby stars , obtaining statistics of _ stellar _ companions as a by - product .",
    "the typical sample size of imaging surveys is still small , on the order of 100 targets .",
    "most imaging and rv surveys for low - mass companions explicitly avoid known visual binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so important star - formation effects may not be represented in their samples .",
    "for example , catalogued triples show that the mass - ratio distributions in close inner sub - systems discovered spectroscopically and in wider `` visual '' sub - systems are radically different ( see section  5 ) .",
    "one of our goals is to investigate if this is a selection effect or a genuine feature of the star - formation process .    in order to improve the multiplicity statistics of a well - defined and sufficiently large distance - limited sample , we focus on @xmath95000 dwarfs with @xmath10 within 67pc from the sun . according to preliminary estimates",
    ", there should be some 400 triples and 100 quadruples in this sample .",
    "surveying such a large sample to detect those multiples with a reasonably deep and known completeness limit is a large task ; here we address only a small part of it . instead of avoiding known binaries ,",
    "we purposefuly selected wide visual binaries from this sample . some of these targets are also monitored in rv , giving complementary constraints on sub - systems with short periods @xcite .",
    "we imaged the chosen wide binaries with adaptive optics ( ao ) to study the properties of inner sub - systems .",
    "ao imaging on 8-m class telescopes provides nearly diffraction - limited resolution of 0.06@xmath11 in the near - infrared , which corresponds to a projected orbital radius of 4au for the farthest target stars in our sample , filling an important gap between rv and seeing - limited imaging surveys .",
    "our sample is detailed in section  [ sec : sample ] .",
    "observations , data reduction , and detection limits are described in section  [ sec : obs ] , the results are presented in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "sections  [ sec : disc ] and [ sec : concl ] contain the discussion and conclusions , respectively .",
    "the wide binaries chosen for our survey belong to a large sample of nearby solar - type dwarfs ( _ nsample _ ) selected from the latest version of hipparcos catalog @xcite by the following criteria :    1 .",
    "trigonometric parallax @xmath12mas ( within 67pc from the sun , distance modulus @xmath13 ) ; 2 .",
    "color @xmath14 ( this corresponds approximately to spectral types from f5v to k0v ) ; 3 .",
    "unevolved , satisfying the condition @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the absolute magnitude in the hipparcos band calculated with @xmath17 .",
    "there are 5040 stars ( i.e. hipparcos catalog entries ) satisfying these conditions .",
    "some of these stars with erroneous parallaxes or colors will be eventually removed from the sample , but this contamination is expected to be minor .",
    "the _ nsample _ defined above is reasonably complete because the cumulative object count versus distance @xmath18 follows the @xmath19 law , deviating from it by only 10% at @xmath20pc .",
    "visual binaries with separations @xmath21 and one or both components belonging to the _ nsample _ were selected for ao observations from the washington double - star catalog , wds @xcite .",
    "additionally , we require each pair to have at least 3 observations and magnitudes of both components listed in the wds , and that apparent motion of the wide pair be compatible with @xmath17 .",
    "as most targets have large proper motions , relative stability of the binary position over time permits rejection of optical pairs .",
    "an additional check was made by placing the components on the @xmath22 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) .",
    "there are @xmath9200 wide binaries in this list , 101 with negative declinations .",

    "as the tradeoff between slower observations with more complex data reduction in coronagraphic mode and slightly saturated psfs is not obvious , we tried both .    typically , each target was observed at 56 dithered positions for a total accumulation time of about 5min .",

    "the data were processed in a standard way using custom idl programs .",
    "individual images written to separate fits files were combined into data cubes , separately in red and blue channels .",

    "most frames contain just one or two bright point sources corresponding to the components of the wide binary .",
    "the position of each point source was recorded by `` clicking '' on its image , then refined by fitting a 2-dimensional gaussian to the central part of the point spread function ( psf ) within 5-pixel radius .",
    "the ratio of the central intensity of this gaussian to the total flux in a @xmath5 diameter circle gives an estimate of the strehl ratio .",

    "its position is the same in both channels , whereas the static speckle pattern scales in proportion to the wavelength .      to measure the relative position and flux ratio of wide binaries",
    "more precisely , we fit the scaled and shifted image of the primary component ( a ) to the secondary ( b ) .",
    "such fits work very well , leaving only small residuals , and produce mutually consistent measurements in the two channels .",
    "the rms scatter between the wide - binary positions measured in two nici channels is 5.5mas in both radial and tangential directions .",
    "we checked the pixel scale and detector orientation by comparing the measured positions of 16 wide pairs ( the widest in table  [ tab : res ] after exclusion of hip  21963 , 43947 and 50883 , which were not used ) with the positions listed in the hipparcos double and multiple star catalogue @xcite .",
    "we did not find any systematic effect above noise and therefore used the nominal pixel scale of 18.0mas for both channels .",
    "we found that the detector orientation of the channels differs by @xmath40 , so @xmath41 were added to measured angles in the blue channel .    for close pairs",
    "where the psfs overlap , we use a variant of iterative blind deconvolution .",
    "good preliminary estimates of the relative component s position and intensity are already available from the gaussian fits of the psf cores .",
    "the image fourier transform ( ft ) is divided by the ft of the binary with preliminary parameters to get an estimate of the psf .",
    "negative parts of this psf are set to zero and it is replaced by its azimuthal average at radial distances over 5 pixels from the center .",
    "the binary parameters are refined by fitting again the image with this synthetic psf",
    ". then the process is repeated , obtaining a second approximation to the psf and using it again ( without azimuthal averaging ) to obtain the final binary parameters .",
    "the success of this procedure is verified by inspecting the resulting psf , which should be `` clean , '' with the least possible trace of the companion .      to determine detection limits , we use mostly the data from the red nici channel where the detection of low - mass components is deeper because of the smaller magnitude difference and larger strehl ratios .",
    "the maximum magnitude difference of detectable companions @xmath42 is estimated by calculating the rms flux variations @xmath43 in circular zones of increasing radii @xmath23 centered on the main component . it is assumed that a detectable companion will have maximum intensity exceeding @xmath44 , therefore @xmath45 .",
    "\\label{eq : dm}\\ ] ] this assumption is , of course , simplistic . we do not account for the existence of two simultaneous images in red and blue channels and for the good knowledge of the psf from other companions of the same target or from other targets observed shortly before or after .",
    "nevertheless , this simple strategy of estimating detection limits is sufficient for our purpose and has been tried before with good results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the limits computed for hip  37322 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simdet ] .",
    "a bump is produced in the curves at @xmath46 pixels by the ghost and by fixed speckle pattern ( see the psf in fig .  [",

    "the remaining 36 pairs have even wider separations . the mass - ratio distributions in these two groups",
    "are markedly different , but our un - biased survey results in a flat mass - ratio distribution , within errors .",
    "therefore , the difference seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : q3 ] is caused by _",
    "observational selection_. given an approximately equal number of close and wide sub - systems with large mass ratios ( two last bins in fig .",
    "[ fig : q3 ] ) and assuming that the mass - ratio distributions in these two groups are indeed similar , we expect that the number of close and wide sub - systems ( with separations below 1au and between 5 and 100au , respectively ) are similar , too .",
    "the completeness of the msc for _ wide _ sub - systems is thus about 1/2 .",
    "is the presence of a wide binary companion influencing the frequency of inner sub - systems ? to answer this question , we compare our results on _ triples _ with surveys of solar - type _",
    "binaries_. unfortunately , binary - star statistics are usually derived regardless of higher - order multiplicity , so a cleaner comparison must await new study of a large unbiased sample .",
    "the separation range from 5 to 100au explored here corresponds to orbital periods between 10y and 1000y . according to @xcite ,",
    "about 20% of solar - type dwarfs have companions with such periods . in the actual , narrower range of projected separations from 6.8au to 44au , 12% of solar - type dwarfs have companions .",
    "therefore , the frequency of sub - systems around components of wide binaries is similar to the frequency of binary companions to single stars in the same separation range .",
    "the frequency of sub - systems with periods below 3y in visual multiples has been determined by @xcite to be between 11% and 18% .",
    "again , it turned out to equal within observational errors the companion frequency among single dwarfs of similar masses in the solar neighborhood and in some open clusters .",
    "@xcite surveyed rvs of 56 wide visual pairs and found that @xmath121 fraction of companions have spectroscopic sub - systems .",
    "therefore , one might surmise that the presence of a wide companion does not affect the formation of inner , closer sub - systems in a wide range of separations .",
    "this question is however far from having been settled for both stellar and planetary sub - systems ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "we know that almost all close binaries with periods below 3d do have additional outer companions , although the mass ratios of close binaries with and without tertiary companions have identical distributions @xcite .",
    "@xcite advocate the idea of a companion mass function with a universal power law over a wide range of separations and masses .",
    "they fit the mass - ratio distribution in solar - mass visual binaries to a power law with @xmath122 .",
    "visual companions to stars more massive than the sun follow a power law @xmath123 with @xmath90 from @xmath124 to @xmath125 , as established in ao imaging surveys by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "certainly , these distributions do not correspond to the most simplistic case of random companion pairing , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "our survey of _ triples _ points to a flat mass - ratio distribution with @xmath126 .",
    "the errors are large , so the difference with visual _ binaries _ is not yet significant . the mass - ratio distribution in closer , spectroscopic binaries is approximately flat @xcite , similar to the mass - ratio distribution in close sub - systems of triple stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : q3 ] ) .",
    "_ if we confirm on a larger sample that sub - systems in triples do differ from pure binaries in their mass - ratio distribution , its universality will be seriously challenged . _",
    "the mass function of companions to binary and multiple stars is radically different from the initial mass function .",
    "therefore , the fraction of low - mass companions is much smaller than the fraction of low - mass stars in the field .",
    "this fact , known as brown dwarf ( bd ) desert , is well established @xcite . adopting a flat mass - ratio distribution for our sample , also typical for spectroscopic binaries",
    ", we estimate that only 7% of companions to a solar - mass star will be in the bd regime .",
    "considering the companion frequency of 0.12 in the studied separation range , one bd companion per @xmath9100 primaries is expected .",
    "our result thus suggests that the bd desert in multiple systems extends to separations of 100au .",
    "the bd desert and the tendency to equal companion masses are explained in the current star - formation scenario by continuing accretion onto a binary . whenever a low - mass companion forms by fragmentation of a massive disk , continuing accretion usually brings its mass into stellar regime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "companions of sub - stellar masses should be intrinsically rare . at the same time the orbital drag ( inward migration ) reduces the separation , producing close sub - systems .",
    "it appears that about half of the companions settle in close orbits with separation @xmath120au , the rest of them remain in wider orbits .",
    "we surveyed 33 nearby wide binaries with solar - type primaries and found 7 resolved sub - systems , most of them previously unknown .",
    "we derive the fraction of sub - systems with projected separations from 5 to 100au to be @xmath127 .",
    "the mass - ratio distribution in these sub - systems appears to be flat , to within a large statistical error .",
    "the sample can be increased 6 times if we continue observations with nici and extend them to the northern sky using some other ao facility .",
    "such investment of 5 nights on 8-m telescopes will enable to reduce the size of the confidence intervals in fig .",
    "[ fig : ml1 ] by 2.5 times .",
    "then , it will become possible to distinguish between the negative power index @xmath128 typical for resolved binaries and flat mass - ratio distribution @xmath129 characteristic of close binaries .",
    "the joint fraction of both visual and spectroscopic sub - systems in wide solar - type binaries is about 0.25 . in consequence , the majority of the components are single , and provide an accomodating environment to host planetary systems .",
