( 1998 ) reported the first detection of bright and narrow ( with the same linewidth of the ambient gas ) sio lines at ambient velocities associated with the molecular outflows in the dark cloud ngc  1333 ( t@xmath1110@xmath14 years ) .",
    "lefloch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that the sio emission arises from the postshock equilibrium gas after the interaction of powerful protostellar jets with local dense clumps .",
    "they concluded that the narrow sio emission could be only detected in particular objects characterized by its high degree of clumpiness .",
    "codella , bachiller , & reipurth  ( 1999 ) confirmed the suggestion of lefloch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the ambient sio emission arises from decelerated postshock material . in this scenario",
    "one would not expect to detect sio ambient emission with narrow linewidths in very young molecular outflows .",
    "the l1448 outflow is a very young outflow with a dynamical age of only @xmath73500 years ( bachiller et al .",
    "1990 ) . due its youth",
    ", this object provides an excellent laboratory to study the origin of the ambient sio emission , because the time scale is too short for the postshock gas to reach the equilibrium ( chize , pineau des forts , & flower  1998 ) and to decelerate to the radial velocities of those of the ambient gas .",
    "the formyl radical ( hco ) has not been detected so far in dark clouds ( e.g. l183 , where the derived hco abundance is @xmath152@xmath1610@xmath17 ; schenewerk et al .",
    "1988 ) . however , gas  phase chemistry models predict even lower hco abundances ( @xmath710@xmath10 ) than the previously measured upper limits to this molecule ( leung , herbst , & huebner  1984 )",
    ".    in this letter we present the first detection of very narrow sio and hco emissions at ambient velocities in the l1448mm / irs3 molecular outflows . the narrow lines and the radial velocities of the sio emission do not seem to be related to decelerated postshock equilibrium gas but produced by the interaction of the magnetic and/or radiative shock ",
    "precursors with the ambient pre  shocked clumpy medium .",
    "the observations were carried out with the iram 30m telescope at pico veleta ( spain ) .",
    "we observed the central position of l1448-mm ( the driving source of the highly collimated outflow ) and l1448irs3 , and mapped the l1448mm region observing towards the offsets ( 20,0 ) , ( 20,0 ) , ( 0,20 ) , and ( 0,20 ) .",
    "table  1 summarizes the parameters of the observed transitions .",
    "the beam size of the telescope was @xmath727  at @xmath790 ghz and @xmath718at @xmath7140 ghz .",
    "the 3  mm and the 2  mm sis receivers were tuned to single side band with image rejections @xmath1110  db . we observed simultaneously the sio  @xmath18=21 , h@xmath3co@xmath4 , hn@xmath3c , and hco species using the frequency  switching mode with a frequency throw of 3  mhz . as spectrometers we used vespa , which provided a velocity resolution of @xmath70.14@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 .",
    "typical system temperatures were 90100  k. we observed the rest of the species ( h@xmath3cn , ch@xmath5oh , n@xmath6h@xmath4 , and the sio  @xmath18=32 transition ) in position  switching mode .",
    "the system temperatures and the spectral resolutions were typically of 120350  k and 0.130.20@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "all the line intensities were calibrated in antenna temperature .",
    "1 shows all the spectra measured for the l1448mm map and l1448irs3 , and table  1 shows the observed parameters for all the lines measured towards the central positions in l1448mm and l1448irs3 . for comparison ,",
    "1 shows , in the upper panels , the profiles of the blueshifted and redshifted shocked gas with broad , @xmath750@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 , lines ( see e.g. , martn  pintado et al .",
    "the ambient profiles are shown in detail in the central panels of fig .  1 .",
    "the sio and hco ambient emissions show very narrow linewidths of @xmath70.5@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 , smaller than those of the ambient cloud molecules like h@xmath3co@xmath4 , hn@xmath3c , and n@xmath6h@xmath4 which have widths of @xmath71@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 .",
    "there are appreciable differences between the observed profiles of sio , hco , and the other molecules .",
    "while all ambient molecules towards l1448mm show double peaked profiles with velocity peaks at 4.7 and 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 ( see vertical dashed lines in fig .  1 ) , the hco and sio lines are single gaussian narrow profiles with peaks at 4.7 and 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 respectively ( table  1 ) .",
    "vla images of the ambient nh@xmath19 gas show that these two components correspond to distinct molecular clumps with different spatial distribution associated with the l1448mm source ( curiel et al .",
    "1999 ) .    from our limited map ,",
    "we notice that the detection of the sio emission in the 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 cloud is related to an increase of the ion abundance with respect to neutrals .",
    "2 illustrates this effect by representing the sio line intensities as a function of the ratio between the ion ( h@xmath3co@xmath4 ) and the neutral ( hn@xmath3c ) intensities for the 4.7 and the 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 components .",
    "although the data are scarce , the tendency of the sio emission to increase with the ion to neutral intensity ratio is clear . since the lines are optically thin , this shows that the larger sio abundance in the ambient cloud is associated with an enhancement of the ion abundance relative to the neutrals .",
    "furthermore , we find that the sio profile towards l1448mm ( 0,20 ) presents a substantial broadening ( redshifted with respect to the ambient gas ) due to material which has already entered the shock .",
    "although ch@xmath19oh is also a neutral molecule , its emission is shifted to the 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 component . as discussed in section 4 ,",
    "these data are consistent with the fact that the sio and ch@xmath19oh abundances are enhanced by grain mantle destruction produced by shocks ( millar , herbst , & charnley  1991 ) .",

    "the abundances derived for this molecule ( @xmath710@xmath10 ; table  2 ) are in agreement with these models , suggesting that the 4.7@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 material traces the quiescent gas . the sio / hco abundance ratio changes by more than two orders of magnitude from the 4.7 to the 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 component of the ambient gas , indicating that the formation of both molecules are related to different mechanisms .",
    "the spatial distribution and the kinematics of the narrow sio emission suggest that this emission is associated with the molecular outflows towards l1448mm and l1448irs3 . however , the lines are very narrow and with the radial velocities of the ambient gas",
    ". we can rule out the idea that the ambient sio emission is generated in the postshock equilibrium gas since the time scales for the shocked gas to decelerate to the ambient velocities are much larger ( @xmath3810@xmath14 years ) than the dynamical age , and the sio has not been detected in the ambient 4.7@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 cloud .    in the following ,",
    "we explore the possibility that the sio ambient emission is a signature of the shock precursors associated with the jets driven by the young stars .",
    "there is a tendency for the ambient sio emission to arise only from regions where the relative abundance of the ions to neutrals is larger than in the quiescent clumps ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this indicates that the ions could have slipped to the 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 component from the neutrals of the 4.7@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 cloud , as expected if this narrow emission were produced by the magnetic precursor associated with c  type shocks .",
    "the magnetic precursor would force the plasma to stream through the neutral gas ahead the jump front , generating a velocity decoupling between the charged and neutral fluids ( draine  1980 ) . as the charged particles were compressed in the first stages of the magnetic precursor",
    ", the ion density would initially increase in the 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 component with respect to the quiescent 4.7@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 cloud ( see e.g. flower et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "pilipp , hartquist , & havnes  ( 1990 ) and pilipp & hartquist  ( 1994 ) have considered grains as a separated fluid from the ion , neutral , and electron components .",
    "the behavior of the grains changes depending on several parameters like the @xmath39 density , mean charge , and grain size distribution .",
    "there are cases where the charged grains are coupled to the ions , leading to a small grain",
    " neutral velocity drift just before the shock starts .",
    "the chize et al .",
    "( 1998 ) time ",
    "dependent c  shock model shows that , even for time scales of @xmath1510@xmath14@xmath8years , this velocity drift generates the sufficient friction to produce the ejection of small amounts of silicon from grains into the gas phase in the 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 cloud through sputtering ( flower et al .",
    "1996 ; caselli , hartquist , & havnes  1997 ) .",
    "since these time scales are rather short , we should expect that silicon is released directly in the form of sio , producing an abundance of 10@xmath17 or 10@xmath10 ( flower et al .",
    "1996 ; caselli et al .",
    "the lack of a velocity shift between the sio and the ions for the 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 component also indicates that we are observing the very early phases of the interaction of the shock precursor .",
    "this is supported by the data at the position ( 0,-20 ) where the broader sio profile ( see fig .",
    "1 ) suggests that in this case a large fraction of the neutrals has already entered the shock .    on the other hand , the detection of [ si ii ] 34.8@xmath8@xmath40 m emission in l1448irs3 ( nisini et al .",
    "2000 ) shows the existence of a photon  dominated region ( pdr ) which could be related to the radiative precursor of the j  type shocks ( shull & mckee  1979 ; hollenbach & mckee  1989 ) .",
    "in fact , the c  type shock models of chize et al .",
    "( 1998 ) predict a jump discontinuity in the neutral flow in the early stages for time scales @xmath1210@xmath14  years .",
    "the uv radiation field of the radiative precursor associated with such j  shock could affect the chemistry of the pre  shocked medium .",
    "it might be possible that the ambient sio emission would be produced by the radiative precursor through the photodesorption of si from the grains ( schilke et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , the sio / hco abundance ratio in the 5.2@xmath8km@xmath8s@xmath9 velocity component is very different from what is observed in pdrs ( schilke et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in summary , the linewidths , velocities , abundances , and spatial distribution of the sio in l1448mm / irs3 could be explained by the radiative and/or magnetic shock precursors associated with the jets driven by protostars . based on all these results , we speculate that we have probably detected the first evidence of the chemical effects on the ambient cloud produced by the precursors of interstellar shocks",
