    "electromagnetic emissions in ultra - relativistic collisions are thermally dominated in the low to intermediate mass ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 regions .",
    "thermalization at rhic has now been established from detailed flow measurements of hadrons .",
    "phenix has observed a large dielectron emission in the mass region below the @xmath4 ( @xmath5 mev ) .",
    "these emissions are much larger than those reached theoretically .",
    "the dielectron excess reported by phenix is one of the most dramatic piece of data stemming from rhic .",
    "the phenix collaboration has also recently reported on photon spectra in the intermediate @xmath3 region .",
    "there is one caveat , in that phenix did not actually measure real photons but low mass dielectron spectra which was then extrapolated to the photon point . in this case",
    "their finding was an excess of photons at intermediate @xmath3 ( @xmath6 gev @xmath7 ) momentum . in this case",
    "the excess was in line with those reached theoretically .",
    "our qualitative summary of the above two phenix measurements is as follows .",
    "phenix has observed an excess of di - electron pairs at low mass .",
    "this excess is consistent with theoretical expectations at intermediate @xmath3 ( @xmath6 gev @xmath7 ) momentum .",
    "the excess seen at low momentum @xmath8 gev is well above any theoretical calculations done to date .",
    "thermal emissions at low to intermediate invariant mass ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 are involved due to the many reaction processes involving hadrons and the strong character of their interactions .",
    "the only organizational principles are broken chiral symmetry and gauge invariance , both of which are difficult to assert in reaction processes with hadrons in general .",
    "if hadrons thermalize with the pions and nucleons as the only strongly stable constituents , then there is a way to systematically organize the electromagnetic emissivities by expanding them not in terms of processes but rather in terms of final hadronic states .",
    "the emissivities are then amenable to spectral functions by chiral reduction .",
    "these spectral functions are either tractable from other experiments or amenable to resonance saturation .    in section",
    "ii , we derive the photon emission rates from a thermal hadronic environment in terms of one and two pion final states .",
    "we use the chiral reduction formulae to rewrite the rates in terms of spectral functions . in section",
    "iia and iib we compare our rates to some key processes based on kinetic theory as well as the leading order qgp rates . in section",
    "iic we comment on the experimental extrapolation procedure used recently by rhic to measure the photon emissivities by extrapolating the dilepton rates to the photon point .",

    "we can re - express the correlator in terms of the absorptive part of the time - ordered correlation function ( q)=^f(q ) , where ^f(q)=id^4xe^iqx(e^-(*h*-f)/t ^(x ) * j*_(0 ) ) . in this work we will consider a heat bath which is nucleon free . in this case",

    "we then find the simple result that @xmath34 which reproduces the result of eletsky and ioffe@xcite .",
    "we should also mention on a more practical level that the dominant contribution to the above expression comes from terms containing @xmath35 and one can therefore neglect terms in containing @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",

    "this corresponds to the matrix element for @xmath38 scattering via exchange of a vector meson .",
    "the additional terms in attach a photon to one of the external lines .    in",

    "clearly the 2-pion emission rates provide substantial enhancement when the emitted photon is soft due to pion bremsstrahlung . at the highest temperatures",
    ", @xmath21 provides an enhancement even for high energy photons .",
    "but at these temperatures the virial expansion is clearly beyond its limit of applicability .",
    "we stress that the hadronic contributions to @xmath21 involves all hadronic processes in the heat bath with two pions and a photon in the final state .     and @xmath39 for @xmath40 mev . ]",
    "one of the nice features of the above spectral function approach is that one does not need to organize the calculation in terms of the many possible reaction mechanisms , as there is no a priori small expansion parameter in the strongly coupled hadronic phase .",
    "instead the calculation is organized in a virial - like expansion and all possible reaction channels should be included via the zero temperature spectral densities .",
    "the drawback is that we loose some physical intuition as we tend to discuss photon production from a kinetic theory approach . in this section",
    "we now compare our results with kinetic theory results performed by a number of other groups .",
    "first let us start with our @xmath41 piece , which was originally worked out in  @xcite for both dileptons and photons . from a kinetic theory standpoint",
    "this should include all reactions that contain one pion in the final state .",
    "an example of the dominant contribution in this channel is @xmath42 . in",
    "we show the one pion piece @xmath41 as well as the rates stemming from the reaction @xmath43 computed in @xcite . on a qualitative level",
    "we find very good agreement considering the rates were derived from two very different approaches .",
    "we should mention that a full su(3 ) calculation @xcite also includes reactions containing @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( _ e.g. _ @xmath46 ) .",
    "we now come to the @xmath39 piece which is new to this work . from a kinetic theory standpoint",
    "this should be identified as including all reactions with two pions in the final state and in principal can contain any number of initial state particles .",
    "we expect the reactions @xmath47 and @xmath48 to dominate .",
    "these reactions were calculated in @xcite and are shown in .",
    "these two kinetic processes alone can not explain the observed enhancement that we find in our @xmath39 contribution .",
    "our computed @xmath21 should also contain @xmath49 processes such as @xmath50 .",
    "this reaction has been worked out beyond the soft photon approximation in @xcite .",
    "we show a parameterization of their results in the region @xmath51 ( gev ) @xmath52 in . on a qualitative level",
    "we see that the pion agrees with our @xmath39 contribution .",
    "we do not claim that the rates encoded in @xmath41 and @xmath39 are the end of the story . in the above comparison",
    "we have selected the reaction channels which we expect to be implicitly included in our analysis .",
    "we can conclude that we have a good handle on many of the kinetic theory processes shown above .",
    "the most significant being the @xmath38 encoded in @xmath39 .",
    "there are other reactions ( _ e.g. _ @xmath53 ) , while not included in our @xmath54 analysis , have been shown to have strength at low energy @xcite .",
    "there has been great progress in the calculation of the qgp photon rates in perturbative qcd .",
    "we will not go through the full history of these results but instead highlight some key points as they may become relevant from a phenomenological perspective .",
    "first off , the born contribution corresponding to @xmath55 contributes at order @xmath56 for dileptons but vanishes at the photon point due to energy momentum conservation .",
    "therefore , for photons , the first non - trivial contribution will come from one - loop diagrams , @xmath57 , corresponding to the annihilation @xmath58 and compton @xmath59 processes .",
    "these diagrams contain a logarithmic singularity stemming form the exchange of a soft massless quark .",
    "the singularity is cured by including htl @xcite corrections to the quark propagator .",
    "the net result is to give the exchanged quark a thermal mass of order @xmath60 and the rates are indeed finite as shown in @xcite .",
    "we have plotted the photon rate due to @xmath61 process in .",
    "it was later realized in @xcite that the @xmath61 processes of annihilation and compton scattering are not the only diagrams that contribute at order @xmath62 .",
    "it was found that there are a class of diagrams that even though they are naively of higher order are promoted to order @xmath62 due to co - linear singularities .",
    "two examples of such processes are @xmath63 and annihilation with scattering @xmath64 where @xmath65 can be either a quark , anti - quark or gluon .    in order to obtain the leading order result",
    "one must resum an infinite set of ladder diagrams which contribute at the same order . in resumming this infinite set of diagrams one must also take into account the lpm effect which suppresses the rate due to the effects of multiple collisions on the photon production process .",
    "this was demonstrated and evaluated in full in @xcite . in this work",
    "we use the complete leading order rates including the lpm effect as parameterized in @xcite .",
    "the additional processes included in the full leading order calculation give a large enhancement to the rates as seen in .",
    "the leading order qgp rates have one parameter , @xmath66 , which should be evaluated at a scale on the order of the temperature . in this work",
    "we evaluate the coupling constant using the two - loop @xmath67 function in @xmath68 scheme . in order to asses the uncertainty in the scale choice we have evaluated the yields assuming the coupling runs with two different scales : @xmath69 and @xmath70 . at @xmath71 mev , which is a typical initial temperature in our hydrodynamic evolution we have @xmath72 versus @xmath73 . while at our chosen transition temperature of @xmath74 mev we have @xmath75 versus @xmath76 .",
    "even though we have yet to discuss the details of the space - time evolution ( see ) it is still instructive at this point to compare the yields from the qgp phase for various systems in order to see the uncertainty in the scale choice . in",
    "we show the ratio of the qgp yield coming from collisions at sps , rhic and the lhc at the two scale choices .",
    "we will focus on the results above @xmath77 gev since the perturbative rate calculations breakdown below this scale as we will discuss in a moment . in general",
    "we find an enhancement in the yields by a factor of @xmath78% at the sps and @xmath79% at the lhc by decreasing the scale from @xmath80 to @xmath81 . at the lhc",
    "there is a smaller uncertainty in the scale choice since the temperatures in the system are much higher yielding smaller running coupling effects .",
    "this analysis shows that at rhic there will be a systematic uncertainty in the yields on the order of @xmath82% due to the scale choice . with this in mind",
    "we have chosen to fix the scale to @xmath69 for the remainder of this work in order to get an upper bound on the photon emissivities from the qgp phase .",
    "let us now come to where we have compared the hadronic and quark - gluon plasma rates for a broad range of photon energies .",
    "we have generated the plot at the transition temperature @xmath74 mev , where both rates have the largest theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the qgp rates are plotted with a substantial coupling @xmath83 which is the highest reached in the simulation .",
    "we should stress that in the transition region one should be extremely skeptical of the rates .",
    "for both the hadronic gas and qgp the expansion parameters have become of order one ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) .",
    "one might argue that the qgp rates can be trusted as long as the argument under the log is larger than one .",
    "this is the case as long as one remains above @xmath86 gev .",
    "it is reassuring to see that the photon rates are in qualitative agreement ( within a factor @xmath87 ) as one approaches the transition region from above or below .",
    "in this section we would like to discuss some general considerations between photons and low mass dileptons as well as the rates for the latter .",
    "the discussion of this section will be relevant for understanding the systematic uncertainty in the recent photon measurements at phenix as well as understanding part of the source of the low mass di - electron excess observed at phenix .",
    "we will withhold the model comparison to data until .",
    "the rate of dilepton production per unit four volume and four momenta is given by @xmath88 for massive dielectrons .",
    "as a result we have @xmath89 which ties the dielectron rate to the _ virtual _ photon rate @xmath90 for spacelike momenta . in the above expression",
    "the correlation function @xmath91 is the same as in but now evaluated at @xmath92 .",
    "therefore the spectral function approach used for the rates in the hadronic phase naturally contains the rates for photons and dileptons .",
    "the resulting dilepton rates when including the additional two pion piece @xmath21 can be found in @xcite and will be briefly discussed later .    the recent photon measurement reported by phenix",
    "is actually extracted from low mass dielectron data below the two pion threshold .",
    "this is done in order to avoid the large background from hadronic decays . in order to extract the photon rates the phenix collaboration makes use of the following relation between photon and dilepton production @xmath93 in the above expression @xmath94",
    "is a process dependent factor .",
    "this process dependent factor goes to @xmath95 for @xmath96 . for @xmath97 and @xmath98 decays ( which is the dominant hadronic background ) @xmath99 when @xmath100(the mass of the hadron ) . by cutting out invariant masses less than the @xmath101 and",
    "@xmath98 mass the background from hadronic decays will be largely suppressed .",
    "the assumption taken by the phenix experiment is that @xmath102 when @xmath103 .",
    "the high @xmath3 , low mass electron pairs are then taken to the photon point via .",
    "since our spectral function approach has direct access to both photons and low mass dileptons we can easily determine ( in a model independent way ) the @xmath94 factor for hadronic production processes .",
    "in we plot ( in arbitrary units ) the virtual photon rate ( @xmath104 ) where @xmath105 is the rate of virtual photon production via .",
    "the left figure includes only @xmath20 while the right figure includes @xmath106 .",
    "we have fixed the three momentum to @xmath107 gev .",
    "if our process dependent factor @xmath94 was indeed equal to one , we would not see any mass dependence in our plotted @xmath105 .",
    "this is not the case however . for our leading order ( @xmath41 ) rates at @xmath108",
    "the factor @xmath94 varies by a few percent up to a mass of 300 mev .",
    "if this was the dominant thermal process then the photon extrapolation made by phenix would be satisfactory .",
    "however , when including the more complicated production mechanisms contained in @xmath39 the @xmath94 factor can change by as much as 30% at @xmath109 mev when @xmath110 gev .",
    "since phenix fits the low mass electrons in the @xmath111 mev region we can confidently say that our @xmath94 factor will give a discrepancy of @xmath112% .",
    "this leads to a fairly large unconstrained systematic error on the phenix extrapolation procedure .",
    "we stress the fact that this error is unconstrained because the @xmath94 factor could in principal be very different in the qgp where the production mechanisms may be much different .",
    "let us conclude this section by a quick discussion on the dilepton rates in the qgp phase .",
    "these will be used in our analysis of the phenix data in .",
    "naively one would expect the leading order born contribution , @xmath113 , to dominate the dilepton mass spectrum .",
    "this breaks down at low mass due to phase space constraints . for @xmath114",
    "the next to leading order contribution starts to take over .",
    "all of the same considerations for photons has to be taken into account for dileptons including the htl resummation , the summation of ladder diagrams and the inclusion of the lpm effect .",
    "this was worked out in full for dileptons in @xcite . for applications we use the parameterization of this result by @xcite .",
    "these rates are applicable in the kinematic regions where @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the phenix acceptance can fall outside of these regions , so we caution the reader to this additional systematic uncertainty that comes about when comparing to experiment . to the lpm rates one must also add the @xmath61 process worked out in @xcite which were computed in the approximation @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "before a direct comparison with data can be made the photon emission rates of the qgp and hadronic phases must be integrated over the space - time evolution of the collision .",
    "the collision region is modeled using a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation tuned in order to reproduce hadronic observables . in this section",
    "we discuss the specifics of the model , including the initial conditions and equation of state ( eos ) , but leave the technical details to the literature .",
    "the required initial condition for the hydrodynamic evolution is the entropy density , @xmath120 , and baryon density , @xmath121 , in the transverse plane for a given impact parameter ( b ) and initial proper time ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the entropy and baryon density are proportional to the number of wounded nucleons ( participants ) which is set by a glauber model .",
    "more precisely the initial condition is s(*r*,b)= ( * r*;b ) , + n_b(*r*,b)= ( * r*;b ) , where @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) is the entropy ( net baryon ) density per unit rapidity per participant and is set in order to reproduce the charged particle multiplicity and net proton number respectively .",
    "once the initial conditions are set the hydrodynamic evolution equations are solved .",
    "the resulting evolution yields the energy density and flow velocity as a function of proper time @xmath26 and transverse coordinate .",
    "the energy density can then be converted to a temperature using the given eos .",
    "the rates are then integrated over the space - time volume following the same procedure in @xcite .",
    "shows the parameters used for the sps , rhic and lhc . for rhic",
    "we have used two different evolution models ( labeled as rhic 1 and 2 ) in order to study the effects of the space - time evolution .",
    "we will discuss the specific evolution models as they become relevant in the following sections .",
    ".hydrodynamical parameters for : sps , rhic and lhc . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we should stress that we make no attempt to perform global fits to the data .",
    "there are still a number of uncertainties present in the hydrodynamic model which would effect the resulting photon yields .",
    "the approach taken in this work is to choose parameters for our evolution model which yields a reasonable description of bulk observables such as the total multiplicity , @xmath125 spectra and elliptic flow .",
    "an example of one uncertainty is the shear viscosity , which when included would require us to re - tune the initial conditions in order to achieve the correct final state multiplicities ( as shown in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , viscous corrections will also modify the underlying photon and dilepton rates @xcite .",
    "these considerations are all beyond the scope of this work and should be thought of as part of the overall uncertainty in our evolution model .",
    "the wa98 collaboration has measured direct photons from pb+pb collisions at @xmath126 gev per nucleon using the statistical subtraction method in @xcite . in this case",
    "upper limits could be obtained for photon momentum in the range @xmath127 and data points obtained above @xmath128 gev .",
    "in addition the yield of direct photons was also measured in @xcite using direct photon interferometry .",
    "the most probable yield is found by assuming a source size of 6 fm and a lower limit is obtained by assuming a vanishing @xmath129 .",
    "the data is summarized in the left plot of",
    ".    shows our predicted yields using the sps hydrodynamic evolution from . in this case",
    "we have used identical parameters to @xcite .",
    "this work used a bag model eos having a latent heat of 0.8 gev/@xmath130 and was able to reproduce the @xmath125 spectra and elliptic flow at the sps .",
    "above 2 gev one must also include the prompt production which we have left out in this analysis .",
    "this additional contribution was discussed thoroughly in @xcite .",
    "our results are consistent with the upper limits that were obtained at intermediate momentum .",
    "the right figure of [ fig : sps ] is the same as the left but rescaled in @xmath3 between 0 and 0.8 gev .",
    "this figure shows the leading order qgp along with the single pion process @xmath41 are almost an order of magnitude below the data . by including the additional @xmath39 component our rates are now at the lower limit of the data .",
    "in addition one may question how changes to the evolution might effect the results .",
    "it is very probable that one could find a different set of parameters which reproduces the hadronic data at the sps while also increasing the yields of direct photons .",
    "this type of global analysis is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "it is clear however , that pion as encoded in @xmath39 is a necessary component to understanding the direct photons at sps .",
    "we should stress that the role played by baryons is large at low momentum @xcite .",
    "while baryons were not included in this work , we can still estimate the enhancement by looking at other calculations .",
    "the work of steele _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found that baryons , when treated to first order in nucleon density , can increase the rates relative to @xmath41 by an order of magnitude at @xmath131 gev .",
    "based on we can estimate that the inclusion of nucleons could increase our overall rates ( when the @xmath132 contribution is added to @xmath39 ) by a factor of about two .",
    "this would comfortably keep us within the wa98 data .",
    "let us now come to the recent phenix measurements of photons . for au+au collisions at rhic energies ( @xmath133 gev )",
    "we have chosen to use two different evolution models ( called rhic 1 and 2 ) in order understand some of our systematic uncertainty stemming from the hydrodyanmic evolution . in both cases",
    "we use a lattice motived eos @xcite which includes a rapid crossover followed by an interpolation into the hadronic resonance gas phase . even though there is no true phase transition",
    ", we still must choose a value of @xmath134 where we switch from qgp to hadronic production .",
    "of course , this choice of @xmath134 will not effect the hydrodynamic evolution which is determined only by the sound speed .",
    "we will fix this to @xmath135 mev which is consistent with lattice calculations at almost physical quark masses @xcite .",
    "the difference between rhic 1 and 2 is the initial hydrodynamic starting time as well as the freezeout temperature . for rhic 1",
    "we have @xmath136 fm / c and @xmath137 mev . in the case of rhic 2 we have started the hydrodynamic evolution even earlier at @xmath138 fm / c . in this case , in order to have reasonable agreement with bulk observables one must use a higher freezeout temperature , @xmath139 mev . the rhic 1 parameter set is closer to the one used in @xcite which found good agreement with the elliptic flow of hadrons . in the case of",
    "rhic 2 we expect to have a larger contribution coming from the qgp phase and a smaller contribution from the hadronic phase .",
    "note that we do not include any out - of - equilibrium contribution ( other than the prompt contribution ) before our initial starting time @xmath122 .",
    "in we show the hydrodynamically evolved photon emissivities using the evolution parameters of for rhic 1 ( left ) and rhic 2 ( right ) . the yields from the hadronic gas and qgp cross at @xmath140 and 0.6 for rhic 1 and rhic 2 respectively .",
    "the earlier thermalization in the rhic 2 evolution gives a much larger qgp contribution at high momentum .",
    "we now come to the recent measurement of direct photons by phenix @xcite",

    "we have now also included the prompt photon production which is derived from a fit to the measured photons in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions .",
    "our finding is that even though the relative contributions from the different phases are much different the sum remains about the same for the two different evolution models . in the case of rhic 1",
    "the relative contributions from the qgp and hadronic are about equal .",
    "for rhic 2 the qgp has a larger contribution to the overall yield ( which grows with increasing @xmath141 ) .",
    "the differences in the two models are largest at high @xmath141 where the prompt production dominates . taking into consideration all of the systematic uncertainties that we have discussed throughout this work it is impossible to discriminate between the two evolution models .",
    "this suggests that there may be a large ambiguity in using photons as an early time probe of the medium .",
    "we would now like to revisit our past analysis @xcite of the measurement of dielectron pairs by phenix @xcite . in our prior work we used the leading order",
    "born contribution ( @xmath113 ) as the only reaction present in the qgp phase .",
    "while this is true at high mass the naive perturbative expansion breaks down at low mass which might explain the missing low mass yield from theoretical models @xcite .",
    "we have therefore included in addition to the born contribution the next to leading order contribution .",
    "the rates used in this analysis were summarized at the end of .",
    "for the analysis of the low mass dileptons we have chosen to use the rhic 2 evolution model .",

    "we could perform runs at various centralities and average accordingly in order to make a more direct comparison but this is beyond the scope of this work .    in the left plot of we",
    "show the individual contributions to the low mass dielectron yield .",
    "new to this figure is the inclusion of the @xmath39 component in the hadronic phase .",
    "even though this component added a lot of strength to the low momentum photons the effect is much less dramatic in the case of dileptons .",
    "there is a large enhancement in the dilepton rates at low mass _ and _ low @xmath3 as demonstrated in @xcite . by @xmath143",
    "mev almost all of the enhancement contained in @xmath39 is removed by the low @xmath144 cuts of the phenix acceptance .",
    "therefore , to a very good approximation , our @xmath41 makes up the entire hadronic yield at phenix after the acceptance cuts .",
    "also shown in is the qgp born contribution . as we can see this contribution diminishes at low mass due to phase space . however",
    ", when we include the next to leading order ( nlo ) corrections , the qgp yields starts to increase below @xmath145 and actually overtakes our hadronic contribution below @xmath146 mev . at high mass",
    "( above @xmath147 gev ) the nlo rates are suppressed relative to the born term due to the thermal quark mass gev by simply using the born rate with massive ( @xmath148 ) quarks . ] .        the right plot of shows the total yields which includes summing the cocktail provided by phenix along with our thermal hadronic and qgp yields .",
    "we have shown the net yield using only the born contribution ( `` sum w/ born only '' ) which is essentially the result from our previous work @xcite .",
    "we also show the yield using the full leading order in @xmath66 result ( `` sum w/ nlo qgp '' ) .",
    "the leading order qgp explains the excess in the mass region @xmath149 ( mev ) @xmath150 .",
    "about 50% of the thermal qgp production in this mass region is due to the one - loop compton and annihilation processes .",
    "the other 50% required to explain the excess comes from the higher - loop processes included in the ladder diagram resummation .",
    "the two - loop piece of this corresponds to the diagrams .",
    "one should not be surprised that the qgp contribution overtakes the hadronic yield at low mass .",
    "it is already known that quark dominates over @xmath101 in the @xmath151 integrated rates @xcite .",
    "in addition the @xmath3 spectrum of the @xmath101 falls much quicker then that of the quark , which only increases the relative yield of the quark to pion contribution when low @xmath3 cuts are applied .",
    "larger transverse flow in the hadronic gas alleviates this picture by shuffling strength from low @xmath3 to high @xmath3 but it can not compensate for the differences in the @xmath3 spectrum .",
    "even though the addition of the full leading order qgp rates does not explain the excess in the mass region @xmath152 ( mev ) @xmath153 it does help in adding some strength to the yield in this mass region .",
    "the mechanism behind the excess in the @xmath154 mev region is still unclear .",
    "what the authors find striking is the resemblance between the excess seen here and the excess observed in lower energy @xmath155 and @xmath156 collisions referred to as the `` dls puzzle '' .",
    "the resolution was related to a better theoretical understanding of production in @xmath157 collisions and verified by looking at @xmath158 and @xmath159 control measurements @xcite . in light of this",
