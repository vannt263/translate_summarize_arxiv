    "it has been known for quite some time that quantum field theories generically contain states associated with negative energy @xcite .",
    "indeed , negative energy seems to be required by the laws of physics for such effects as hawking evaporation ( which allows the unification of black holes with the laws of thermodynamics ) @xcite , and for the stability of the minkowski vacuum . in the former case ,",
    "the positive hawking radiation observed at infinity is paid for by a flux of negative energy down the horizon of the black hole @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "since the vacuum is not an eigenstate of energy density , there will be energy density fluctuations in the vacuum . in order for the averaged energy density to be zero",
    ", there must exist negative , as well as positive , energy density vacuum fluctuations .",
    "states associated with negative energy are now routinely produced in the laboratory , e.g , squeezed vacuum states and the casimir effect @xcite .",
    "however , the energy density itself is too small to be directly measurable .    on the other hand , unrestricted amounts of negative energy could result in gross macroscopic effects such as violation of the second law of thermodynamics @xcite , and exotic spacetime geometries such as wormholes @xcite , warp drives @xcite , and time machines @xcite .",
    "however , the laws of quantum field theory contain restrictions on negative energy in the form of `` quantum inequalities '' .",
    "these involve bounds on the magnitude of negative energy and on its temporal or spatial extent .",
    "there has been much progress in this area in the last 15 years ( for some recent reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "some years ago , helfer  @xcite suggested the existence of a class of quantum states in which one could make the energy density arbitrarily negative in an arbitrarily large region of space , even in minkowski spacetime .",
    "we call these `` helfer states . ''",
    "the present authors , together with helfer , verified this claim in an earlier paper @xcite , which we will refer to as fhr .",
    "in that paper the characteristics of the energy density were analyzed .",
    "we argued that a crucial feature of these states is the fact that although the energy density can be made arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space , this can be done _ only at one instant of time_. the worldline quantum inequalities must hold for these states as well , since they have been proven to hold for _ all _ quantum states .",
    "therefore , for this to be true , there must be rapidly time - varying fluxes which accompany the negative energy density . in the current paper , we show that this is indeed the case .",
    "the expectation values of the energy density and flux in a particular helfer state are calculated and graphed , and their correlations are studied .",
    "an inertial observer who initially passes through the negative energy region must quickly encounter fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region , thus ensuring that the time - averaged sampled energy density along the observer s worldline is non - negative , in accordance with the quantum inequalities .",
    "these fascinating correlations of flux and energy density are by no means unique to the helfer states .",
    "in the second part of the paper we calculate the energy density - flux correlation function for the minkowski _ vacuum _ state , in both two and four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "although here we analyze correlation functions , as opposed to expectation values , nonetheless , we find remarkably similar behavior for the fluctuations of energy density and flux in the vacuum to their expectation values in the helfer states .",
    "an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy into the region .",
    "we speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum inequalities hold in the helfer state , as well as in other quantum states associated with negative energy , is , at least in some sense , already `` encoded '' in the fluctuations of the vacuum .",

    "as originally discussed in fhr , the energy density may be made arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region at one instant of time .",
    "we see here that the accompanying rapidly oscillating fluxes will ensure that the quantum inequalities are not violated , by quickly `` pumping '' enough positive energy into the region such that the time integral of the energy density over any observer s worldline will always be positive .",
    "recall that the spatial region over which the negative energy density appears can be arbitrarily large .",

    "[ fig : flux - ed - fig3 ] .",
    "the time scale for the variation of the energy density is about two orders of magnitude smaller that the size of the negative energy region .",

    "rather , the energy density and flux are correlated over spacelike intervals .",
    "the energy fluxes depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : flux - ed - fig1 ] and [ fig : flux - ed - fig3 ] are coherent over the entire region .",
    "a related example of spacelike correlations in quantum states with negative energy density was discussed in ref .",

    "we saw in the previous section that , in the helfer state , the regions of negative energy on a @xmath134constant surface were correlated with a rapidly time - varying energy flux .",
    "indeed it is this correlation which ensures that the worldline quantum inequalities are satisfied .",
    "as the energy density in a spatial region became negative , there was an accompanying positive energy outflow from ( or equivalently , a negative energy inflow into ) the region .",
    "when the energy density in the region began to rise and become positive again , this was correlated with a positive energy inflow to ( or equivalently , a negative energy outflow from ) the region .",
    "does this behavior represent the general case ?",
    "one might think that the answer is no . the emission of spatially and temporally separated pulses of negative and positive energy by moving mirrors would not appear to fit this profile @xcite . however , the moving mirror example is two - dimensional .",
    "it has been argued elsewhere that , in four - dimensions , the emission of two separated plane sheets of negative and positive energy would violate the quantum inequalities , unless the positive sheet were infinite in extent @xcite .",
    "so the spatial isolation of negative and positive energy in the moving mirror case may well be an artifact of two - dimensions @xcite .",

    "we analyze energy density - flux correlation functions in the minkowski vacuum state , in both two and four dimensions .",
    "we find an analogous correlation between energy density and flux here as well .",
    "that is , if an energy density fluctuation in a region of the vacuum is initially negative , it is likely to be followed by a flux fluctuation of positive energy into the region .",
    "the fact that we see this behavior in the vacuum state as well suggests that it may represent the generic case .",
    "the correlations already seem to be `` coded '' in the vacuum state .",

    "<S> this is a state in which the energy density can be made arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space , but only at one instant in time . in the helfer state , </S>",
    "<S> the negative energy density is accompanied by rapidly time - varying energy fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> it is the latter feature which allows the quantum inequalities , bounds which restrict the magnitude and duration of negative energy , to hold for this class of states . </S>",
    "<S> an observer who initially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region . </S>",
    "<S> we examine in detail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the helfer state in terms of their expectation values . </S>",
    "<S> we then study the correlation function between energy density and flux in the minkowski vacuum state , for a massless minimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions . in this latter analysis </S>",
    "<S> we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the helfer state . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy into the region . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum inequalities hold in the helfer state , as well as in other quantum states associated with negative energy , is , at least in some sense , already `` encoded '' in the fluctuations of the vacuum . </S>"
