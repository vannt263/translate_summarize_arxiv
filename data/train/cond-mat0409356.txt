    "the primitive model ( pm ) for electrolytes , molten salts , collods , etc is a mixture of @xmath0 species of charged hard spheres living either on a lattice or within a continuous volume of real space . in this paper",
    "we shall focus only on the off - lattice version of the model .",
    "the simplest version of the pm consists of a binary mixture ( _ i.e. _ @xmath1 ) of positive and negative charged hard spheres @xmath2 all with the same diameter @xmath3 . under this form the model which is thought to be",
    "the prototype of many ionic fluids has been christened the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) .",
    "a thermodynamic state of the rpm is entirely specified by a reduced density @xmath4 ( @xmath5 number of ions , @xmath6 volume ) and a reduced temperature @xmath7 ( @xmath8 boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "the rpm undergoes a liquid - vapor transition which has been studied extensively these last past years by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and various theoretical approaches .",
    "in particular the behavior of the system at its critical point ( cp ) has been the subject of a huge amount of numerical and theoretical studies .",
    "the question is obviously of great importance since it is reasonable to assume that real electrolytes - or at last a large class of them- and the rpm belong to the same universality class which dictates a similar critical behavior .",
    "it is perhaps the right place to note that the main feature of ionic solutions is that the pair potential between two ions @xmath9 and @xmath10 at a distance @xmath11 which reads as    @xmath12    is a long range interaction .",
    "this fact would suggest classical ( mean field ) behavior , whereas the well - known screening of the interactions pleads in favor of an ising - like criticality typical of systems with short range interactions .    on the experimental side it seems",
    "well established now that for many real electrolytes apparent mean field behavior applies with sharp crossover ( much sharper than in nonionic fluids ) to ising criticality close to the critical temperature @xcite .    at the moment",
    "there exists no convincing theoretical proof showing that the rpm belongs to the ising universality class @xcite and only sophisticated monte carlo simulations can support this claim .",
    "most numerical studies of the cp of the off - lattice version of the rpm were performed by the orsay group and i would like to review our contributions towards a better understanding of the critical properties of this model in the lines below .",
    "quite generally , a single component fluid will undergo a liquid vapor transition if the pair potential which is assumed to represent the molecular interactions is ( sufficiently ) attractive at large distances . from this point of view",
    "the situation is not so clear in the case of the rpm ( cf eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) ) and the very existence of the transition is not guaranteed .",
    "several studies were necessary to clarify this point and a brief historical survey is worthwhile .    the first evidence that the rpm actually undergoes a liquid - vapor transition can be tracked back to two papers of chasovkikh and vorontsov - vel yaminov ( cvvy ) published as soon as in 1976 @xcite .",
    "these authors performed isobaric mc simulations and found a transition with a cp located at @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "several years after ( in 1991 ) valleau studied three isotherms of the rpm with his method of the density scaling mc and obtained a different location for the cp , namely @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xcite . subsequently",
    "( in 1992 ) panagiotopoulos @xcite obtained still different results , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath17 , @xmath18 , by performing mc simulations in the gibbs ensemble ( ge ) , at the moment a powerful new method of simulation which he had invented a little bit earlier @xcite .",
    "subsequent ge simulations using an improved biased mc sampling @xcite yielded panagiotopoulos and orkoulas to the new estimate @xmath19 , @xmath20 . finally , making use myself of the gibbs ensemble combined with the use of hyperspherical geometries i obtained rather @xmath21 , @xmath18 @xcite .    commenting on this striking dispersion of the mc data prof m. fisher talked once of the `` sad street of numerical simulations '' .",
    "this was in 1999 , at the sccs conference , st malo , france and , at this point of the story , i must agree with him retrospectively .",
    "however many advances have been done since . before giving an account of these new achievements some comments are in order .    *",
    "\\(i ) all the mc studies confirm the existence of a liquid vapor transition for the rpm .",
    "it seems to take place at unusually low densities and temperatures .",
    "caillol and weis give further support for such a low critical temperature @xcite .",
    "moreover it turns out that the coexistence curve is very dissymmetric @xcite . *",
    "\\(ii ) the mc simulation of ionic systems is a numerical challenge due to the long range of coulomb potential . in order to deal with this",
    ", some caution is needed .",
    "thus , in the case of mc simulations performed in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , one must use ewald potentials in order to obtain the correct physics @xcite .",
    "the point is that the ewald potential is the solution of poisson equation in a cubico - periodical geometry @xcite and many properties of ionic fluids ( electro - neutrality , screening , etc ) are a consequence of this fact . in their mc simulations cvvy and valleau considered truncated coulomb potentials and very small samples of @xmath22 particles which yields quantitatively wrong results .",
    "by contrast the data of panagiotopoulos _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite are more reliable since ewald sums have been used .",
    "the same remark apply to my simulations which were performed on a 4d sphere ( a hypersphere for short ) by considering interactions obtained by solving poisson equation in this geometry .",
    "this alternative method of simulation is therefore also indisputably correct , moreover it is much more efficient .",
    "the rough agreement observed between the simulations of refs . @xcite and @xcite both involving the same number of ions , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 , is therefore not fortuitous . *",
    "\\(iii ) none of the above mentioned studies took correctly into account finite size effects which are of an overwhelming importance near a cp .",
    "these effects affect the behavior of finite systems as soon as the correlation length of the critical density fluctuations is of the same order of magnitude than the size of the simulation box . in the simulations",
    "@xcite some `` apparent '' critical temperature @xmath24 has been measured which could be very different from its infinite volume limit @xmath25 .    in order to extract from mc simulations the critical behavior of the rpm in the thermodynamic limit ( _ i.e. _ the critical exponents ) and also the infinite volume limit of @xmath24 and @xmath26 it is necessary to perform an analysis of the mc data in the framework of the finite size scaling ( fss ) theory which is part of the renormalization group ( rg ) theory @xcite .",
    "in this approach one needs to work in the grand canonical ( gc ) ensemble rather than in the gibbs ensemble which is ill adapted for a fss analysis .",
    "subsequent mc simulations on the rpm were thus all performed in this ensemble .",
    "panagiotopoulos and coworkers turned their attention to the lattice version of the rpm whereas the orsay group continued to work on its off - lattice version .",
    "starting with the seminal work of bruce and wilding ( bw)@xcite simulation results for the critical behavior of fluids have customarily been analyzed along the lines of the so - called revised scaling theory of rehr and mermin @xcite . in this approach",
    "one first defines scaling fields and operators aimed at restoring the particle - hole symmetry and therefore to map the the fluid onto a magnetic sytem with ising - like symmetry .",
    "the two relevant scaling fields @xmath27 ( the strong ordering field ) and @xmath28 ( the weak thermal field ) are assumed to be linear combinations of deviations from their critical values of the chemical potential @xmath29 and the inverse temperature @xmath30 ( reduced values are assumed henceforward ) .",
    "one thus has    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the field mixing parameters which define the mapping .",
    "of course relations  ( [ fields ] ) are valid only in the vicinity of the cp .",
    "the conjugate scaling operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 are then defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the gc partition function of the rpm , @xmath38 the total number density , and @xmath39 the internal energy per unit volume .",
    "brackets @xmath40 denote gc averages .",
    "@xmath34 is the order parameter ( magnetization ) of the magnetic system associated with the fluid and @xmath35 its magnetic energy .",
    "@xmath35 should be invariant under the transformations @xmath41 for appropriate values of @xmath33 and @xmath32 . in this framework",
    "the coexistence curve is therefore defined by the eq .",
    "@xmath42 .",
    "the revised scaling of rehr and mermin implies the analyticity of the coexistence chemical potential @xmath43 at @xmath24 .",
    "although this is the case for some peculiar lattice gas models with `` hidden '' symmetries there is no reason that in general , for fluid systems @xmath43 should lack a singularity as recognized already by rehr and mermin @xcite and emphasized more recently by fisher and co - workers @xcite .      a central role in the subsequent fss analysis",
    "is played by the gc joint distribution @xmath44 for the scaling operators @xmath34 and @xmath35 . following bw",
    "@xcite we will assume that , in the immediate vicinity of the cp , @xmath45 obeys to the following scaling law :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 are the linear dimensions of the system ( taken as @xmath48 , where @xmath6 is the volume of the simulation box , either a cube or a hypersphere ) .",
    "i have denoted by @xmath49 and @xmath50 the deviations of the scaling operators from their value at criticality .",
    "the cornerstone of this scaling hypothesis is that the function @xmath51 which enters eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) is _ universal _ in the sense that it depends only upon the universality class of the model and of the type of geometry considered .",
    "the constants @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are system dependent constants which are defined in such a way that @xmath51 has unit variance .",
    "finally , the renormalization exponents @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 which enter eq .",
    "( [ scaling ] ) are defined as @xmath58 in terms of the usual critical exponents :    * @xmath59 exponent of the ordering field , _ i.e. _ @xmath60 for @xmath61 at @xmath42 * @xmath62 exponent of the correlation length , _ i.e. _ @xmath63 * @xmath64 wegner s correction - to - scaling exponent ( first irrelevant exponent ) .",
    "the scaling hypothesis  ( [ scaling ] ) was established on a solid rg basis for ising - like systems @xcite and received substantial supports from mc studies @xcite .",
    "we stress once again that the coexistence curve is determined in this approach by the condition @xmath42 and that , at coexistence , the order parameter distribution @xmath65 should be an even function of @xmath66 . in practice",
    "this symmetry requirement can be satisfied by tuning the two parameters ( @xmath67 ) at a given @xmath59 .",
    "we now concentrate our attention on the scaling behavior of the histogram @xmath65 .      integrating both sides of eq .",

    "the dependence of the universal function @xmath51 upon @xmath27 has been discarded for clarity .",

    "for @xmath47 finite but large @xmath65 collapses approximately onto @xmath75 at some apparent @xmath77 .",
    "since for @xmath42 one has @xmath78 then the matching of the histogram @xmath79 onto the universal function @xmath75 should occur at some apparent temperature @xmath80 scaling with system size as @xmath81 where @xmath25 denotes the infinite volume limit of the critical temperature .      to assess the critical behavior and the critical parameters of the system , we need , in a first step , to locate the coexistence curve @xmath42 . at a given temperature @xmath59 close to @xmath82 the ordering distribution function",
    "@xmath65 depends solely on the chemical potential @xmath29 and the mixing parameter @xmath33 . at coexistence",

    "this technical difficulty is circumvented by using the multiple histogram reweighting proposed by ferrenberg and swensen @xcite . with this method one can obtains @xmath84 for a continuous set of values of ( @xmath59,@xmath29 ) from the knowledge of @xmath85 histograms @xmath86 obtained by performing @xmath85 distinct mc simulations in the @xmath85 ( neighbor ) thermodynamic states ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "since the precision of the simulations of fluid systems has still not reached that obtained in the mc simulations of ising like systems it is impossible to construct _ ex nihilo _ the fixed point universal distribution @xmath75 . in refs .",
    "@xcite our attempts to match @xmath65 on @xmath75 were realized by using the estimate of @xmath88 made by hilfer and wilding @xcite for the 3d ising model .",
    "two new -and better- estimates of @xmath88 obtained by tsypin and blte @xcite for the 3d ising model and the spin-1 blume - capel model were considered in ref .",
    "the discussion is postponed to next section .",
    "it turns out that the field mixing parameter @xmath33 of the rpm is practically independent of the temperature and of the size @xmath47 of the system .",
    "its magnitude , @xmath89 @xcite , is much higher than for neutral fluids ( typically @xmath90 for square well or lennard - jones fluids @xcite ) which explains the large dissymmetry of the liquid - vapor coexistence curve of the rpm .",
    "the collapse of the ordering operator distribution @xmath65 onto the universal ordering distribution @xmath88 given by the blume - capel model @xcite is depicted in fig .  1 for four different values of the volume ranging from @xmath91 to @xmath92 , _",
    "i.e. _ up to a linear size @xmath93 . at volume",
    "@xmath91 a mismatch is observed at the lowest values of @xmath66 due to an inadequate sampling of of the low density configurations at small volume .",
    "the overall good agreement leads us to conclude that the universality class of the rpm is that of the 3d ising model .",
    "the reduced apparent critical temperature @xmath80 versus the size @xmath47 of the system ( in reduced units ) has been plotted in fig .",
    "2 . depending on the choice made for the universal ordering distribution @xmath88 one obtains two sets of values of @xmath80 from which @xmath25 can be obtained by making use of eq .",
    "( [ tinf ] ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath94 using @xmath88 derived from the blume - capel model and @xmath95 using @xmath88 obtained for the 3d - ising model .",
    "the approximate @xmath88 of hilfer and wilding yields slightly different results .",
    "note that in all cases we have used the ising values @xmath96 @xcite and @xmath97 @xcite of the critical exponents .",
    "the previous analysis merely establishes the compatibility of the mc data with an ising - like criticality .",
    "one can try to go beyond by considering the scaling behavior of the binder cumulant @xmath98 as a consequence of the scaling hypothesis  ( [ scalingbis ] ) one can show that , at coexistence ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath99 should scale with system size as    @xmath100    where the last term takes into account contributions from irrelevant fields and @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 are non universal constants . if the contribution of irrelevant fields could be neglected then the curves @xmath99 would intersect at the fixed point @xmath105 . as apparent in fig .",
    "3 this is clearly not the case and corrections to scaling must be taken into account .",
    "recall that for the 3d - ising model the fixed point value is @xmath106 @xcite and that the exponent of the correlation length has the value @xmath96 @xcite .",

    "our fss analysis leads to an estimate of the critical exponents @xmath62 and @xmath121 and the binder cumulant @xmath115 based on the sole knowledge of the critical temperature and the renormalization exponent @xmath64 . within the numerical uncertainties",

    "i give below the values obtained for the critical temperature , chemical potentials and densities ( the critical pressure is largely unknown ) :    * @xmath122 * @xmath123 * @xmath124      the revised scaling theory of rehr and mermin which is the framework of our fss analysis is however not the most general scaling theory which can be proposed for a fluid system lacking the `` particle - hole '' symmetry .",
    "its main weakness , as recognized already by rehr and mermin @xcite , yang and yang @xcite , and more recently by fisher and co - workers @xcite , is that it assumes the analyticity of the chemical potential at coexistence @xmath43 at the critical point .",

    "let us examine the consequences of these singularities on the behavior of the specific heat capacity at constant volume @xmath127 .",

    "although the peak positions shift correctly as @xmath139 with system size , in accord with fss theory @xcite , there is no detectable scaling of the heights of the peaks which should scale as @xmath140 with @xmath47 .",
    "these observations corroborate similar results obtained by valleau and torrie@xcite .",
    "in particular @xmath130 does not show any anomaly which should challenge the use of eqs .",
    "( [ fields ] ) for the scaling fields .",
    "a possible explanation for the non singular behavior of @xmath141 is that the amplitude of the singular term in @xmath141 is small in the rpm and that the specific heat is dominated by its regular part .",
    "note however that , the peak heights in @xmath142 would scale , assuming ising value for @xmath143 only by a factor @xmath144 when doubling the linear dimensions of the system .",
    "it is possible that such a small effect is not detectable within the statistical uncertainties of our calculations .",
