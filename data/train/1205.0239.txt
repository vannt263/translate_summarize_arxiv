    "the molybdenum purple bronze , @xmath5 , is a subject of intensive experimental studies already for more than two decades@xcite , but its unusual properties remain unclear .",
    "several very different experimental probes have been used : angle resolved photo - emission ( arpes)@xcite , scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm)@xcite , dc@xcite and magneto- resistivity@xcite , thermal conductivity @xcite , optical conductivity@xcite , nernst signal@xcite , muons spectroscopy@xcite , x - rays@xcite , thermal expansion@xcite , neutron scattering@xcite .",
    "although the main effort of those investigations was focused on the nature of a mysterious phase transition at around 25k , interesting knowledge about higher energy phase was also gathered .",
    "certain properties of the one dimensional ( 1d ) metal , the luttinger liquid ( tll ) , have been invoked to explain the measured data@xcite and nowadays the presence of the 1d physics is well established experimentally@xcite , at least in some energy range .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "band structure calculations have shown a quasi-1d character of molybdenum purple bronze .",
    "a remarkably simple band structure emerges from rather complex crystal structure . at the fermi surface",
    "there are only two bands , lying very close to each other , in the form of flat sheets dispersing well only along the b - axis .",
    "this gives a hope that purple bronze can indeed be a rare realization of the 1d physics .",
    "the key problem is that several possible mechanisms has been invoked to explain the observed properties , which made the subject quite unclear and controversial . in our opinion",
    "the reason for this situation is that each of previous attempts was focused only on one out of many peculiar properties of @xmath5 and most of them searched for an explanation in the low energy regime ( below @xmath6 ) , where indeed the properties of @xmath5 are the most spectacular .",
    "by now , not enough attention has been paid even to the parameters of the 1d state .",
    "it is only agreed that it emerges at energies as high as 250mev .",
    "the values of these parameters are the first issue one must determine before pursuing research towards low energy regimes .",
    "the unusual physics observed in @xmath5 at the energy scales of order 10mev is obviously a motivation for revising the question of the 1d physics . in order to establish a proper low energy effective theory",
    "one has to begin at highest energies and the step by step move towards the physics taking place around fermi energy .",
    "the first step is to link the results of the dft calculations with the well defined field theory describing the experimental results at around 20mev .",
    "it is this `` high energy '' regime which must be well understood first .",
    "this is the main task of this paper .",
    "the plan of this work is as follows . in sec.[sec : bands ] we begin with a brief introduction of the band structure . in the following section sec.[ssec : tight - bind ]",
    "we propose a tight binding model which is able to approximate bands around the fermi energy @xmath7 , however in addition it contains also the strong correlation terms , beyond the lda - dft . in sec.[ssec : ll - intro ] we give basic notions of 1d physics , used in the rest of the paper .",
    "section sec.[sec : intra ] is dedicated to intra - chain physics : we give values parameterizing strong correlations ( sec.[sec : strint ] ) , estimate tll parameters which this implies ( sec.[sec : ll - res ] ) and give energy scales for the spin sector ( sec.[ssec : spin ] ) . in section",
    "sec.[sec : inter - phys ] we introduce the inter - chain physics .",
    "once again , first we estimate the strength of these interactions ( sec.[ssec : inter - values ] ) and then ( sec.[sec : ladder - ham ] ) cast as many of them as possible into effective ll description , now within the ladder framework . later in sec.[sec : rg ] we study how the non - linear interaction terms will affect the luttinger liquid parameters and what instabilities they can potentially produce . finally in sec.[sec : discus ] we discuss our results for ll parameters in a context of the experimental findings ( sec.[ssec : disc - alpha ] ) , as well as the validity of the 1d approach itself in sec.[ssec : disc - tperp ] .",
    "we also discuss in sec.[ssec : disc - disor ] the role of substitutional disorder in our model .",
    "the conclusions in sec.[sec : concl ] close the paper .",
    "the lattice space group and atomic positions within the structure are known from experiment done by onoda _",
    "et al _ @xcite recently confirmed by the neutron diffraction experiment@xcite .",
    "this rather complicated structure , which consist of well separated slabs parallel to b - c plane , is presented on fig.[fig : structure]a ) .",
    "based on this crystallography knowledge the electronic structure of li@xmath8mo@xmath9o@xmath10 can be calculated using density functional theory ( dft ) _",
    "e.g. _ in the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "recent calculations @xcite lead to results which are globally consistent with several previous computations@xcite .",
    "overall the band dispersions agree well with the measured results obtained by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "for example it shows a flattening of the two dispersive bands at about 0.4 - 0.5 ev below @xmath7 .",
    "other bands are found at least 0.25 ev below @xmath7 .",
    "the only visible discrepancies are the relative vertical shifts of the bands of order 0.1ev .",
    "the computed ratio between the fermi velocities along b- and c - crystal axis , is about 40 , compatible with the reported anisotropic 1d - like resistivity @xcite .",
    "the velocity along @xmath11 is even smaller . at low energies ( around fermi energy @xmath7 )",
    "all calculations gave qualitatively similar results .",
    "there are only two bands which cross the fermi energy and they are placed very close to each other .",
    "they have a strong dispersion in the @xmath12 direction ( b - axis ) and barely no dispersion in the perpendicular directions .",
    "the two bands originate from a pair of zig - zag chains build out of @xmath13 atoms inside @xmath14 octahedra .",
    "the low energies ( close to @xmath7 ) spectral function is located mostly on @xmath15 ( precisely @xmath16 ) orbitals of @xmath17 and @xmath18 atoms , using notation from fig.[fig : structure]a ) .",
    "these two corners of zig - zag are symmetrically inequivalent , thus dimerization is possible .",
    "however their distinction comes more from out of chain , than in chain , environment .",
    "the difference solely within a chain is hard to notice .",
    "it is also hard to distinguish the corresponding gap on the edge of brillouin zone upon the analysis of the lda band structure ( in the following we this assume that it is not larger than @xmath19 ) .",
    "the standard procedure ( see appendix [ app : tight - bind ] ) is to fit the dft band structure with an effective tight - binding model . along the b - axis ( along the chains )",
    "the lda calculations were done in the reduced brillouin zone ( because of the above described presence of two un - equivalent mo sites ) .",
    "then , in a tight binding approximation , we expect that the band will be back - folded with a gap at the boundary of a reduced brillouin zone which corresponds to the above mentioned strength of dimerization ( not larger than @xmath19 ) . in",
    "li@xmath8mo@xmath9o@xmath10 case , while it is rather easy to distinguish the lower half of dispersion bands ( however there are some peculiarities at @xmath20 ) , the upper bands hybridizes strongly with other bands ( originating mostly from oxygen orbitals ) .",
    "their proper identification is then difficult .",
    "the band gap seems to be quite small , however the presence the hybridization makes the estimate quite difficult . in the following",
    "we assume that it is @xmath21 .    along the @xmath22axis",
    "the dispersion relation is quite unusual ( there is a node at zero momenta along this axis ) and this peculiar feature appears within all independent dft calculations@xcite . here",
    "we are also dealing with the reduced brillouin zone , but the presence of the node means that the standard back - folding does not apply at all .",
    "one has to try possible combinations of cosines(see appendix [ app : tight - bind ] ) , keeping in mind two facts : the unequal distances for intra- and inter - ladder hopping and the large inter - ladder distance which implies that the next - nearest neighbor hopping must be very small ( only the light dashed lines on fig.[fig : structure]a ) could give non - zero contribution ) .",
    "we were able to deduce ( see appendix [ app : tight - bind ] for details ) that the hopping in the perpendicular direction @xmath23 is @xmath24 ( certainly smaller than @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) ) .",
    "one should also notice a large frustration , change of sign , when hopping to next - nearest chain ( interladder hopping ) with the amplitude of this hopping @xmath27 .",
    "this change of sign can be ascribed to a phase shift acquired when hopping between pairs of chains , between two @xmath28 atoms via @xmath29 octahedra ( see fig.[fig : structure]a ) .    along the a - axis",
    "we have well separated slabs , with a void between them filled by @xmath30 atoms and mo(6 ) , mo(3 ) tetrahedra .",
    "electrons residing there ( if any ) stay on energies few evs away from @xmath7 .",
    "this explains why lda give a very low dispersion in this direction .",
    "significant deviations from lda were seen in arpes only below 0.2ev . then the two bands seems to merge .",
    "this is also the energy scale revealed by optics@xcite : it shows a formation of a first plasmon edge for electrons along b - axis ( @xmath12 direction ) and a gap value in perpendicular direction .",
    "thus it sounds reasonable to take it as a point where the 1d physics forms .",
    "this is the starting point ( on the high energy side ) of the present study .",

    "the lda - dft results presented in sec .  [ sec : bands ] treat electron - electron interactions at the mean field level .",
    "it is assumed that a single electron moves in an average electrostatic potential .",
    "however it is known that the higher order terms in electron - electron interaction can bring very different physics , particularly in the case of reduced dimensionality .",
    "thus we need to introduce them to our model .",
    "the lda results shows that a majority of carriers density at the fermi energy is localized on zig - zag chains formed by the mo(1 ) and mo(4 ) octahedra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : structure]a ) ) .",
    "we can safely assume that the low energy physics is described by the dynamics of these electrons .",
    "then the low energy hamiltonian formally writes : @xmath31    where the vectors @xmath32 $ ] , @xmath33 $ ] , @xmath34 $ ] define the @xmath35 crystal lattice , summation runs over all ladder sites and depends on the parity of a given site index along directions @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 are the electron - electron interactions not included in the ( mean - field ) dft calculation and the sum goes through positions of all carriers .",
    "the @xmath39 are hopping parameters along each crystal axis , as estimated in the previous section .",
    "as discussed there @xmath40 ( down to @xmath41 ) so we can neglect it for the `` high energy '' range we are interested in .",
    "the electrons are moving exclusively within one slab ( and mostly along the zig - zag chains ) . in eq .",
    "[ eq : ham - tight - bind ] we kept only nearest neighbor hopping , since they are expected to be the dominant ones .",
    "the @xmath42 indicate a possibility of dimerization , namely different hoppings along _ i - th _",
    "axis for even and odd bonds . because mo(1 ) and mo(4 ) are crystallographically different we included the possibility that we are dealing with a dimerised chain , half - filled in the reduced brillouin zone .",
    "we denoted the two corresponding hopping by @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "as explained in the previous section we take @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 accuracy ) .",
    "the @xmath47 describe intra- and inter - ladder hopping respectively ( see appendix [ app : tight - bind ] ) . to lighten the notations we will denote from now on @xmath48 by @xmath49 and @xmath50 by @xmath23 , to emphasize that they correspond respectively to hopping along and perpendicular to the chain direction .    the resulting simplified tight - binding model is shown on fig .  [ fig : structure]b ) .",
    "we simplify the interactions in a similar way , by explicitly considering the intra - chain and inter - chain parts of the interactions .",
    "the microscopic hamiltonian we take is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 ( see table.[tab : tight - bind ] ) is hopping between nearest neighboring @xmath53 ( denoted @xmath54 ) molybdenum atoms along zig - zag chains ( b - axis ) and @xmath55 are a hoppings in a perpendicular direction , within a slab ( c - axis ) , between nearest - neighbors , @xmath56 is intra - ladder while @xmath57 is inter - ladder .",
    "the values of @xmath55 are estimated in appendix [ app : tight - bind ] and summarized in tab.[tab : tight - bind ] . as already mentioned @xmath58 ,",
    "so we can treat it as a perturbation on the top of the intra - chain physics .",
    "the strong correlations ( last two lines in eq.[eq : ham - strong ] ) are usually parameterized by several quantities , which enter into the effective hamiltonian : @xmath59 is the local on - site interaction between charge densities of opposite spin @xmath60 ( hubbard term ) , @xmath61 is the interaction of two carriers placed inside the same chain at a distance @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the interaction of two carriers placed in two different chains in a distance @xmath64 ( both @xmath61 and @xmath63 are defined assuming an environment for which the lda screening is included ) .",
    "we will discuss their strength in sec .",
    "[ sec : strint ] .      in the following sections , it will be shown that the interchain couplings ( both hopping and interactions ) are reasonably weak compared to the intra - chain ones .",
    "we can thus anticipate the need to describe a strongly interacting one dimensional systems .",
    "in such a case , a very convenient formalism to incorporate the strong intra - chain interactions from the start is provided by the luttinger liquid formalism@xcite .",
    "this formalism allows to describe non - fermi liquid state ( tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) ) that occurs in one dimension as a result of the interactions .",
    "the low energy dynamics of such a state is captured by collective , bosonic modes representing charge and spin density fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are connected to the two fields @xmath65 , where @xmath66 for charge fluctuations and @xmath67 for spin fluctuations ( linked with the fluctuations of charge and spin density ) .",
    "these fields have two canonically conjugate fields @xmath68 linked with the respective currents fluctuations . in terms of these collective variables the hamiltonian reads@xcite : @xmath69\\ ] ] where @xmath70 .",
    "all the intra - chain interactions conserving the momentum are now only fixing the precise values of the parameters @xmath71 ( the velocities of the corresponding charge or spin density modes ) or @xmath72 ( the luttinger parameters which control the decay of the various correlation functions ) .",
    "in particular the local spectral function behaves as a power law @xmath73 with the following ( interaction dependent ) exponent : @xmath74 for spin - rotationally invariant case @xmath75 , thus interactions , leading to the anomalous behavior , affects only the charge sector",
    ".    we can thus take ( [ eq : ll - ham ] ) as our starting point for the chain physics , and study in the bosonized representation the effects of the various inter - chain coupling terms .",
    "this will ensure that at least the upper energy scales of the `` high energy '' regime will be properly treated .",
    "the first step to determine the luttinger parameters @xmath71 and @xmath72 is to estimate the strength of the various interactions , which we do in the following section ( sec.[sec : strint ] ) . at energies lower than the fermi energy @xmath7 only two scattering channels are allowed @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( plus eventually higher harmonics ) .",
    "all density - density interactions , with small @xmath78 momentum exchange , can be incorporated into the hamiltonian given by eq.[eq : ll - ham ] .",
    "they contribute to a highly non - trivial dependence of the tll parameter @xmath79 ( see sec.[sec : ll - res ] ) .",
    "the remaining interaction terms produce non - solvable hamiltonians of sine - gordon type , which in general is a functional @xmath80 $ ] of cosine terms : @xmath81\\ ] ] where @xmath82 indicate higher harmonics ( scattering with larger momenta exchange ) . due to these terms",
    "the total problem allows only for approximate solution ( at least in terms of continuous fields theory ) .",
    "the terms present in @xmath83 are derived from large momentum exchange interactions ( of both intra- and inter- chain origin ) .",
    "this is why their presence is analyzed carefully in the further sections .",
    "they are usually treated using renormalization group ( rg ) transformations , which allows to extract the terms that affect the most the tll physics .",
    "this usually enables one to find the existence of gaps in the spectrum of bosonic modes , sometimes even to predict the ground state phase diagram .",
    "this kind of approach will be applied in sec.[sec : rg ] .",
    "let us first consider the physics taking place within a single chain .",
    "we want to obtain ( in sec.[sec : strint ] ) the values of the various intra - chain interactions in ( [ eq : ham - strong ] ) and from there ( in sec.[sec : ll - res ] ) the values of the luttinger parameters for the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ll - ham ] ) .",
    "a fully self - consistent calculation has been performed in @xcite and a value @xmath84ev was found .",
    "this value seems at first sight surprisingly large ( for @xmath15 electrons ) , but a recent study using constrained - rpa @xcite allows to understand this result .",
    "although for bulk mo @xmath85 , it was convincingly shown that the suppression of the pure coulomb value @xmath86 is mostly due to efficient screening in 3d of the d - electrons in our case ( as discussed in details below ) the system is underscreened , which entails also a significantly reduced plasmon frequency in comparison with the pure mo ( from @xmath87 to @xmath88 @xcite ) .",
    "thus the value @xmath89 is justified or probably even modest .",
    "then , if we take previously estimated hopping @xmath49 , we get @xmath90 .",
    "note that this makes the local repulsion by far the largest energy scale in the problem .",
    "in hamiltonian eq.[eq : ham - strong ] we defined intra - chain non - local interaction @xmath61 . in this subsection",
    "we will discuss its strength both in real and in momentum space @xmath92 .",
    "we are going to use shorthand notation @xmath93 , as this is usually the single parameter which enters into so called @xmath94 model for a 1d chain .",
    "this parameter is much more difficult to estimate than @xmath95 ( see sec.[ssec : inter - values ] ) as it involves the dynamics of the 1d metal . rather than trying to estimate it directly from the interaction itself ,",
    "we will simply adjust the value to be put in ( [ eq : ham - strong ] ) and ( [ eq : ll - ham ] ) in order to reproduce the experimental data on optical spectroscopy .    the idea@xcite is based on two independent estimates of kinetic energy in the system .",
    "the first one is related ( by the optical sum rule ) to the plasmon ( edge ) frequency @xmath96 and gives us the total possible kinetic energy available for the given number of carriers .",
    "the same quantity can be computed as an integral @xmath97 of the optical conductivity @xmath98 ( taken only over the highest conducting band ) .",
    "the point is that the second estimate gives us the real kinetic energy , renormalized by interactions .",
    "fortunately the necessary data is available for @xmath99 .",
    "the value of of the plasmon frequency can be read out from fig .",
    "2 in ref.@xcite and gives @xmath100 ( @xmath101 extracted from the lda @xcite is even larger @xmath102 ) .",
    "the sum rule integral @xmath97 was in fact already evaluated in fig .  3 of ref.@xcite .",
    "determining the value of the first saturation from the plot has of course some error attached to it .",
    "we take @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this value is reasonable because at higher energies one expects that the other bands start to intervene .",
    "the rest of the procedure is straightforward , the ratio of bare and interaction suppressed kinetic energy @xmath105 equals to @xmath106 .",
    "then the results of@xcite , together with the previously estimated value of @xmath59 allows to predict @xmath107 which means @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "in addition to the interactions discussed up to now ( which fit within the @xmath94 model for a single chain ) there can also exist interactions between more distant neighbors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : interactions ] ) .",
    "these interactions are non - zero because of the under - screening , a characteristic property of the 1d systems . when the separation is larger than that between nearest neighbor we can approximate the interaction by a continuum limit @xmath110 where @xmath111 is a lattice constant along the b - axis@xcite and @xmath112 is a real space dielectric constant . in 2d and 3d systems",
    "the electrostatic potential is usually well screened thus the thomas - fermi approximation , already used in the dft calculation , is sufficient . in our problem",
    "this means that for the very long length scales @xmath113 the potential is well screened , @xmath114 ( where @xmath115 is the largest lattice constant , along the a - axis , perpendicular to the slabs planes ) , because then the network of the zig - zag chains can be thought as a homogenous 3d bulk . for shorter distances between the interacting electrons @xmath116 and then the distance between the neighboring chains does matter .",
    "the relation @xmath117 implies that there are a few non - zero interaction terms @xmath61 for @xmath118 .",
    "the screened potential inside 1d wire behaves approximately like @xmath119 @xcite , same relation holds for the screening induced by the presence of other wires @xcite . in total",
    "we approximate that @xmath120 will get renormalized by a factor @xmath121 .",
    "this gives a reasonable estimate for @xmath120 , however one has to be aware that for the value of charge mode tll parameter the whole q structure has its importance .",
    "the values of real and momentum space interactions are summarized in tables tab.[tab : str - coupl - r ] and tab.[tab : str - coupl - m ] .",
    "clearly the density - density interactions caused by @xmath59 and @xmath122 are not small perturbations compared to the kinetic energy .",
    "in fact they are the largest energy scale in the problem , larger than hopping along the chains .",
    "thus they shall strongly affect the charge sector , they are strong enough to give rise to well pronounced non - fermi liquid properties . we thus need to estimate the tll parameters entering ( [ eq : ll - ham ] ) .",
    "as we will prove in later sections the following hierarchy of energies holds @xmath123 ( where @xmath124 is an effective superexchange which determines energy scales for spin sector ) .",
    "we thus start by solving the tll problem for a single chain and will consider later the interchain couplings .    even when @xmath125 we stay @xcite in a gapless phase within the tll universality class , but computing the values of the luttinger liquid parameters @xmath79 beyond the weak coupling limit is usually a very difficult problem @xcite , since one can not compute them perturbatively .    in the present case",
    "we have to deal with a quarter filled system with a very small doping ( @xmath126 around 2% ) , and a small dimerization ( as we mentioned in sec.[ssec : tight - bind ] it can not be larger than 10% we take moderately 5% in any future calculations ) and several non - zero interaction terms @xmath127 .",
    "as a first approximation we decided to analyze the physics of these zig - zag chains by looking at a quarter filled extended hubbard chain with a local interaction @xmath59 and a nearest neighbor one @xmath122 .    if @xmath59 is the larges energy scale in the problem then the charge sector can be mapped onto a spinless chain of fermions ( or an xxz spin chain ) for which the exact tll parameters are known @xcite . for a certain value",
    "@xmath91 we have @xmath128}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 is the critical value of intra - chain nearest neighbor interaction for a given value @xmath59 . when @xmath130 the mapping is exact and the critical value is known @xmath131 . in this case we get @xmath132 which sets the lower limit for the tll parameter .",
    "this is a rough estimate , but suggests that for further analysis we should use approaches which are valid for the gapless phase .",
    "a more precise estimate can be obtained from a numerical study of the extended hubbard model , and an estimation of the tll parameters in the usual way via thermodynamic quantities @xcite . from the relevant plots one reads out that our model is located somewhere in the range @xmath133 .",
    "one can try to give an even better estimate using eq.[eq : kxxz ] even when u is not infinite ( but still with u much larger that any other energy scale in the problem ) .",
    "it is commonly believed that the value @xmath129 extracted from the numerics can give quite good approximation when substituted into ( [ eq : kxxz ] ) .",
    "estimates of critical @xmath129 are usually done with higher precision , than for arbitrary @xmath134 . in our case",
    "@xmath135 implies @xmath136 @xcite and @xmath137 from older work by mila and zotos@xcite .",
    "this gives @xmath138 ( with @xmath139 ) or @xmath140 .",
    "we have also followed the critical scaling analysis proposed in @xcite and found similar value @xmath141 .",
    "the exact solutions e.g. bethe ansatz are available for a few special cases .",
    "if we include a ( quite weak ) dimerization and ( very small ) doping then the problem is located far away from any integrable model .",
    "however the influence of both these perturbations are known .",
    "the dimerization is able to lower a bit value of @xmath142 , this effect can be present in particular in our case when we are not far from @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "the doping has the opposite effect , however when one is not very close to critical point @xmath144 and close to commensurate case then the effect is negligible .    to conclude : the knowledge about the @xmath145 we have collected above allowed us to give a several estimates based on complementary numerical calculations of @xmath94 models .",
    "all these estimates gives @xmath146 ( we allowed for 10% error in the @xmath145 due to uncertainty of parameters ) .",
    "this is also in agreement with a very recent study for a system with finite range interaction@xcite : @xmath147 when we take similar value of on - site term and account for the presence of @xmath61 interactions up to four - five mo sites .",
    "however in this last paper interactions with an exponential character were studied , which means that they decay much faster than those in our problem .",
    "note that this @xmath142 value is reasonably close to the one @xmath148 that would lead to a quarter - filled mott insulator in the presence of an infinitesimal @xmath91",
    ". the system will be thus very susceptible to the precise value of @xmath91 . given the accuracy of our estimation we will take @xmath149 for further calculations .",
    "this value corresponds to the case for which the @xmath150 charge fluctuations decay with the same exponent than the @xmath151 charge and spin density fluctuations@xcite .      by now we have studied interactions in real space ( which we believe can be useful for numerical studies ) , while cosine terms beyond the tll general expression ( [ eq : ll - ham ] ) are defined in the reciprocal space representation .",
    "these values of scattering for large momenta exchange will be used as an input for the discussion done in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] .",
    "the hubbard @xmath59 interaction has a form of a delta function in real space thus in momentum space it contributes equally to small and large momenta exchange scattering ( provided they are the intra - chain ones ) .",
    "the previous considerations also imply that , the fourier transformed @xmath92 is a weakly decaying function ( slower than logarithm ) , so it affects the amplitude of scattering processes with large momenta exchange . as it was already expressed above the intrachain interactions",
    "are much larger then @xmath49 thus it is not straightforward to obtain the value of backscattering they cause .",
    "in fact the @xmath149 parameter given above , known from numerical studies of similar models , is a fixed point value @xmath152 which means that it contains a part of these contributions .",
    "precisely it is the part included in the simplified @xmath94 model .",
    "the longer range , slower decaying interaction leads to smaller value of @xmath152 .",
    "this suggests that the proper value of @xmath152 in our problem which contains long range interaction can be even smaller .    in our case",
    "the charge sector is renormalized by the possible umklapp terms @xmath153 , so the last statement can be rephrased : the smaller final value of @xmath152 can be linked with larger value of initial , bare @xmath154 .",

    "in addition , the @xmath112 when computed using rpa ( beyond standard dft ) gives a well known phenomena , the friedel oscillations ( in real space ) .",
    "the effect comes from the peculiar screening ( singular susceptibility ) at large momenta @xmath155 . in our case ,",
    "due to the value of @xmath156 along chains , it gives an extra gain of energy for electrons located every second site .",
    "this affects the large momentum exchange part of interaction @xmath157 .",
    "the value of this gain can be estimated using the fact that , for 3d metal , the additional oscillating part @xmath158 thus we give an estimation @xmath159 .",
    "it is not as large as u or v , but can be significant if we compare it with @xmath23 .",
    "the u - v model that we have considered so far ( in particular in sec.[sec : ll - res ] ) is of course only an approximation of the intra - chain physics and interactions .",
    "it should capture most of the effects at the energy scales we are considering , however it may slightly underestimate the strength of interactions .",
    "all the interactions considered up to now were connected with the charge sector . in 1d systems , because of the spin - charge separation , electrons spin degree of freedom should be discussed separately . for a half filled chain the knowledge about @xmath49 and @xmath59 allows to estimate the spin - spin exchange ( superexchange ) constant @xmath160 .",
    "this determines the energies at which spin sector starts to play a role .",
    "the problem of purple bronze is more complex since the compound is quarter filled .    for such cases the formula for superexchange interaction",
    "can be still obtained from second order perturbation theory@xcite .",

    "however it is a non - negligible value in the sense that even for energies as high as @xmath168 ( in the middle of the considered `` high energy '' regime ) the spin excitations are coherent and dispersion is linear thus a tll description with spin and charge modes is applicable .",

    "it should be smaller because the active electrons have mostly @xmath16 character ( with a larger * * _ @xmath176-_**number value ) .",
    "thus @xmath173 can be treated as a perturbation for @xmath177 , contrary to @xmath59 for @xmath49 in a charge sector .",
    "this implies that @xmath178 deviates from the non - interacting value @xmath179 much less than @xmath79 .",
    "to be precise from weak coupling theory ( applicable in this case ) we know@xcite : @xmath180 from which we predict @xmath181 which can increase the green s function exponent @xmath182 only by @xmath183 .",
    "the spin sector thus can not be responsible for the experimentally observed values of the @xmath182 exponent ( defined in eq.[eq : alpha - chain ] ) which are of order @xmath184 .",

    "after giving the description of a single chain physics we move beyond this model and study the strength ( and the role ) of interactions between carriers moving in different chains .",
    "the density - density interactions can be estimated as a standard coulomb interaction between charges in a 3d dielectric , as it was done in ref.@xcite .",
    "those authors gave estimate for a value of interaction from standard electrostatic coulomb law ( with the simplest static screening ) : @xmath185 which in fact gives the value for two electrons in two different 2d slabs .",
    "we are more interested in interactions inside the slab which is obviously larger because ( the smallest ) interchain distance is then @xmath186 .",
    "a more fundamental problem is the value of the dielectric permittivity @xmath187 . in the previous work @xcite the bulk @xmath188",
    "was used , which is typical for bulk semiconductors with similar value of a gap for oxygen states(@xmath189 ) .",

    "however for the nearest chains , as there is only one raw of oxygen atoms in the space between them , such large @xmath187 value overestimates the screening provided by sparse environment ( a material with locally similar structure ) the measured value is @xmath191@xcite ] .",
    "it is then convenient to take a function @xmath192 such that @xmath193 is reduced by @xmath194 in comparison with @xmath190 . for larger @xmath64 distances at",

    "the above estimate was done between two nearest chains which form a pair ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : interactions ] ) . on the other side of each chain",

    "there is a @xmath202 term which locks the interchain density wave , the so called @xmath203 , which is shown on the fig .",
    "[ fig : out - instab]a ) . from the figure it is clear that the distances @xmath204 between charges in such configuration are rather large ( around three times larger than the distance entering to previous calculation for @xmath205 ) thus the screening is quite efficient and",

    "in fact not only further chains , but also further slabs can intervene ( because @xmath207 )",
    ".    there will be either a very efficient screening ( like in a metal ) , or coulomb potential approximation ( but with enhanced @xmath187 ) is still applicable .",
    "we assume , optimistically , the second case and use again ( [ eq : voutcoulomb ] ) .",
    "two ways of proceeding are possible when one is interested in the staggered component of the interaction between two chains . in real space",
    "( direct application of ( [ eq : voutcoulomb ] ) ) one computes interactions with a linear set of dipoles . due to increase of @xmath192 the interaction ( with further dipoles ) decays rapidly , which makes this straightforward approach quite tedious . in the reciprocal space approach",

    "the second approach is simpler when one notice that the previously computed @xmath195 correspond to @xmath210 ( a distance between slabs sets the large distance cut - off ) .",
