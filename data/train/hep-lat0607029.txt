    "in recent years , there has been a number of techniques developed for improving estimates of quark propagators on the lattice ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the main idea is to try to devise an estimator formulation which allows one to use all ( or at least many ) lattice sites as source locations for the quarks , rather than just having a fixed location , which is traditionally the case .",
    "if successful , one then has an estimate of the quark propagators from anywhere to anywhere in the lattice ( typically called `` all - to - all '' propagators ) .    in the following sections we add our voices to the crowd and",
    "present our own method , which is based , foremostly , upon domain decomposition , or more specifically , the decomposition of block matrices .",
    "we end up with two different types of estimators : one for `` open '' propagators between two domains of the lattice ( or `` half - to - half '' ) and one for `` closed '' propagators within one of the domains .",
    "we first show how we devised our method through the consideration of random sources .",
    "later we present first results for the two types of estimators and some of their possible applications : static - light mesons for the open propagators and disconnected correlators for the closed .",
    "using a set of random sources , @xmath0 , placed at all sites of the lattice , one can determine a corresponding set of solution vectors ( we use a summation convention for repeated indices throughout this paper ) : @xmath1 since we know that @xmath2 , we can construct an estimate of the full propagator : @xmath3 this is , however , a rather noisy estimator and we map out some improvement schemes in the following sections .",
    "the main feature of our approach involves the consideration of independent regions of the lattice , or domain decomposition , a technique used previously for `` maximal variance reduction '' ( mvr ) of pseudofermion estimators @xcite .",
    "similar considerations may also be used for improving dynamical lattice updates @xcite .",
    "we can think of the lattice as a disjoint union of two regions .",
    "the full dirac matrix can then be written in terms of submatrices @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 connect sites within a region and @xmath7 and @xmath8 connect sites from the different regions .",
    "( for simplicity , we suppress color , spin , and site indices in the following . )",
    "regardless of the shape or nature of the regions , a similarity transformation is all that is needed to reach this form .",
    "we can also write the propagator in this form : @xmath9      it is helpful to imagine reconstructing the sources in one region , @xmath10 , from the solution vectors everywhere , @xmath11 , and to separate the contributions from the different regions : @xmath12 if we now apply the inverse of the matrix within one region , we have @xmath13 this can be solved for @xmath14 and substituted into the original expression for the noisy estimator of the propagator between the two regions : @xmath15 \\chi_2^{n\\dagger } \\nonumber \\\\    & \\approx & - \\frac1n \\left ( m_{11}^{-1 } m_{12 } \\eta_2^n \\right ) \\chi_2^{n\\dagger } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last line we eliminate the first term due to the fact that we expect @xmath16 .",
    "this is a crucial step , for here we cut out of the calculation what amounts to being only noise .",
    "it does not come for free , however , since we must perform the additional inversion within the subvolume @xmath17 .",
    "writing out the full expression , we obtain @xmath18 where the second line is an exact expression , showing that one can relate elements of different regions of @xmath19 via the inverse of a submatrix of @xmath20 .",
    "( we do not pretend to have derived something new here ; after all , @xmath21 is the schur complement of @xmath22 .",
    "we only wish to emphasize the useful connection with random - source techniques . ) again , the lesson learned up to this point is that we need no sources in one of the two regions .",
    "the story does not end here , however .",
    "looking again at eq .",
    "( [ postdiluting ] ) , one can see that we need not make the approximation @xmath23 .",
    "instead , we can place the approximate kronecker delta between the @xmath7 and @xmath21 : @xmath24 where we have used the @xmath25-hermiticity of the propagator ( this is done only for convenience since we could just as well work with @xmath26 in the @xmath27 ) . from the next to last line",
    ", one can see that the signal only rises from terms where the two components of the @xmath28 s are the same . however , unlike the naive estimator , eq .",
    "( [ naive_estimator ] ) , where there is only 1 such term giving a signal - to - noise of @xmath29 , here there are many : for @xmath30 source points , the signal - to - noise is @xmath31 .",
    "terms where the components of the sources are not the same can still be eliminated by `` dilution '' of the original source vectors , @xmath32 , that go into the @xmath33 , the @xmath27 , or for greater noise reduction , both simultaneously . probably more important than these considerations ,",
    "however , is the fact that , for most of the propagators between the regions , the random sources are kept far from the end points .",
    "also , one can use all points in one region for the source and all points in the other region for the sink .",
    "the ideal domain decomposition for quark propagators which contribute to connected diagrams is then to use two unequal volumes , one containing a few more time slices ( those of the sources @xmath34 ) than the other .",
    "ideally , the centers of the two sets of source time slices should be separated by @xmath35 .",
    "the number of source time slices is dictated by the lattice dirac operator since the @xmath34 s should be placed on all time slices which communicate with the other region via one application of @xmath20 . for wilson and fixed - point ( fp ) @xcite quarks , this is just 2 time slices , 1 adjacent to each boundary . for chirally improved ( ci ) quarks @xcite , which we use here , 4 are necessary ( see fig .  [ ideal_sources ] ) . for the asqtad action @xcite ,",
    "6 are needed due to the presence of the naik term .",
    "while for overlap fermions @xcite , it might be best to use equal volumes for the two regions since the sources will have to cover one region entirely .",
    "but we stress that for all of the above , one is free to dilute further : e.g. , by inverting the sources on the different time slices separately .    ) which are needed to construct the estimate of the ci quark propagator between regions .",
    ", width=377 ]    for our first attempt of using this method , we do not choose the ideal decomposition .",
    "we use equal volumes for the two regions and place sources next to the boundaries in both regions ( see fig .  [ sources ] ) . although this choice may not be ideal",
    ", we do perform inversions for each spin component separately ( spin dilution ) .",
    "note also that , since our sources occupy all relevant time slices surrounding the boundaries , we can actually obtain two independent estimates of the quark propagator between the two regions : @xmath36    ) which we use to construct the two estimates of the ci quark propagator between regions of equal volume .",
    "colors and shapes indicate which source region contributes to the signal in the resultant vectors .",
    "the @xmath37 s are calculated using only one of the source regions , while the @xmath38 s use both .",
    ", width=302 ]    so our method is very similar to that of mvr , except for the fact that we can work directly with @xmath20 , instead of @xmath39 .",
    "this gives the current method three advantages : first , it is less problematic to invert @xmath20 since it has a better condition number than @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "second , implementing the method is straightforward .",
    "one needs only to limit the range of application of @xmath20 when performing inversions in the subvolumes and when multiplying by the matrix between regions . otherwise , existing routines remain unchanged .",
    "third , the sources need only occupy enough time slices to connect them with the other region via @xmath20 , rather than @xmath39 .",
    "these are the same number of sources for wilson - like operators , where @xmath39 , like @xmath20 , only extends one time slice .",
    "however , for many other improved operators ( like ci and fp ) this can reduce the number of necessary source time slices by a factor of 2 .      working with the propagator within one of the regions ,",
    "say 1 , and following a similar derivation as in the previous section , one obtains an expression potentially useful for estimating quark propagators which return to the same region : @xmath40 so once again , through the consideration of random sources , we arrive at an exact expression ( and again , one which is nothing new ) .",
    "now , combining the expressions for @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , we arrive at the relation : @xmath44 inserting our random sources into this expression gives @xmath45 note that we put no region index on the second @xmath34 , indicating that for this resultant vector ( @xmath46 ) we wish to use sources initially placed everywhere on the lattice .",
    "the advantage of expression ( [ disc_estimator2 ] ) may not be immediately clear since it still contains the explicit appearance of @xmath47 .",
    ", @xmath46 ) of eq .  ( [ disc_estimator2 ] ) . ,",
    "width=377 ]    this seeming hindrance can be remedied by considering a very small volume for region 1 . performing this `` highly reduced '' inversion exactly",
    ", we hope to find a significant gain in the signal - to - noise ratio : the first term in the above expressions will be exact and the second term , as compared to its naive estimate , may be improved by a factor of as much as @xmath48 , where @xmath30 is now the volume of sources in region 2 which connect to region 1 via @xmath20 .",
    "so if the volume of region 1 is kept small enough and the lattice dirac operator connects each site to many others , there may be an advantage to calculating the @xmath47 s exactly , as opposed to simply inverting more sources .    here",
    ", we propose to use spin - diluted , but full - volume sources for @xmath34 , so that we can , in the end , use all sites as the starting and ending point of the propagator @xmath49 with only @xmath50 original full - volume inversions : the @xmath51 in @xmath52 .",
    "we can consider the smallest , symmetrical volume for region 1 , the point itself ( @xmath53 ; see fig .",
    "[ disc_sources ] ) , in order to reduce the amount of work needed to calculate @xmath47 , which we need for each point in the lattice . with this choice ,",
    "at most one needs to invert @xmath54 @xmath55 matrices . since @xmath56 for the ci operator in this scenario",
    ", we hope that this small amount of extra work may be worth the effort . in the end , however , we actually use a larger region 1 , including nearest neighbors ( @xmath57 ) , but we avoid some extraneous work by only inverting @xmath5 upon 12 sources located at the central point .",
    "in this section , we present some first results obtained with our estimated quark propagators .",
    "we first use the open propagators for the light quark in heavy - light meson correlators , where we use the static approximation for the heavy quark .",
    "we also show the effects of using our closed propagators in disconnected correlators .",
    "for our meson source and sink operators , we use bilinears of the form : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a gauge - covariant ( jacobi ) smearing operator @xcite and @xmath60 is the covariant derivative . for our basis of light - quark spatial wavefunctions , we use three different amounts of smearing and apply 0 , 1 , and 2 covariant laplacians to these : @xmath61 where the subscript on the smearing operator denotes the number of smearing steps ; all are applied with the same weighting factor of @xmath62 .",
    "so we have a relatively narrow , approximately gaussian distribution , along with wider versions which exhibit one and two radial nodes , due to the application of the laplacians .",
    "we point out that , thus far , we have not altered the quantum numbers of the meson source since both the smearing and laplacians treat all spatial directions the same ( i.e. , they are scalar operations ) . in order to create mesons of different quantum numbers",
    ", we use these light - quark distributions together with the operators shown in table [ sl_ops ] ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    .",
    "static - light meson operators .",
    "[ sl_ops ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one thing is clear though : due to the improvement of the light - quark propagator estimation , and our subsequent ability to use half the points of the lattice as source locations , we have greatly improved our chances of isolating excited heavy - light states . in an earlier study @xcite of heavy - light mesons using wall sources on the same quenched configurations , we were barely able to see the @xmath63 state , let alone the excited states in any other operator channel .",
    "also , there we used nrqcd for the heavy quark ; this should only boost the signals since the heavy quark can then `` explore '' more of the lattice through its kinetic term .",
    "it is obvious , however , that we have much better signals now since we are able to see excited states in every channel ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ) on the quenched lattice .      as a preliminary testing ground for our closed propagators",
    ", we take a look at some first results for the disconnected contributions to pseudoscalar ( @xmath68 ) meson correlators : @xmath69    again , we use 12 random spin - color sources ( initially placed everywhere on the lattice ) , spin - dilute them , and perform inversions ( @xmath70 ) at a quark mass of @xmath71 on the quenched configurations .",
    "we then condition these `` naive '' estimates via eq .",
    "( [ disc_estimator2 ] ) using the central point and its nearest neighbors ( nn ) as region 1 ( the calculation of all the @xmath22 s for this sized region on a single configuration takes less than a day on a pc ) .    in figure [ dg5_corr ] we compare results obtained via the naive and improved estimators on two different quenched configurations .",
    "the errors are estimated via the single - elimination jackknife subsets of the 12 random sources .",
    "looking at the result for the configuration on the left , we can see significant reduction of the errors over many time separations .",
    "this is not the case for all configurations , however , as one can see on the right , where the errors are comparable , if not slightly larger for the improved version . for both cases shown here ( and in fact for all configurations ) the central values for the improved method follow a smoother curve",
    "this should be no great surprise since the improved estimator uses sources on neighboring time slices ( see figure [ disc_sources ] ) , whereas the naive one does not .",
    "so the improved version should smoothen out some of the remaining fluctuations over different @xmath72 values .",
    "an important thing to note here is that , despite any of the improvement which we may gain from the smaller errors on some configurations and the smoothening of the curves , the error for the ensemble average of @xmath73 will be dominated by the limited number of gauge configurations ( i.e. , this is a `` gauge - limited '' quantity ) .",
    "one can see from the figure that the fluctuation which comes from switching configurations is as big as , or bigger than , the jackknife errors from the sources .",
    "for some other configurations , the jump in the corresponding @xmath73 values is much larger .",
    "these are perhaps configurations with large values of topological charge , @xmath74 ; after all , the integrated disconnected pseudoscalar correlator is related to the square of this quantity @xcite : @xmath75 where the relation is only approximate here since we use only chirally improved quarks .    ) on two different quenched configurations .",

    "title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] ) on two different quenched configurations .",
    "errors result from a single - elimination jackknife procedure over the 12 random spin - color sources .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=226 ]    although we see no great overall improvement for these light , disconnected pseudoscalars , this is a tough testing ground .",
    "it remains to be seen how well these improved closed propagators will perform for other quantities where only averages of single loops over single time slices are needed : e.g. , @xmath76 loops within hadron correlators to measure strangeness content , an application which we plan to look into in the near future .",
    "we also point the interested reader to other improvement schemes for closed contributions : see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we have presented a method for improving the estimation of quark propagators in lattice qcd .",
    "the improvement we obtain for open propagators between equal subvolumes of the lattice is significant .",
    "the boost in statistics from being able to use up to half of the lattice sites as starting locations for our static - light meson correlators allows us to extract a number of radially and orbitally excited states ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) .",
    "as we have pointed out , our method is similar to the maximal variance reduction approach @xcite .",
    "however , since we can work with the dirac matrix @xmath20 , rather than @xmath39 , our method may be better suited for highly improved actions .",
    "although the first results for our improved closed propagators are not very promising , it appears that we have chosen a very difficult application ( light , disconnected , pseudoscalar correlators ) for which to test them .",
    "we reserve final judgment on their usefulness for the future , when we measure their performance in other physical quantities .",
    "we would like to thank christof gattringer for many helpful discussions .",
    "we are also indebted to our colleagues in graz ",
    "christian b.  lang , wolfgang ortner , and pushan majumdar  for sharing their dynamical ci configurations with us .",
    "we also wish to thank andreas schfer for fostering a large research group , thereby making collaborations such as this possible .",
    "simulations were performed on the hitachi sr8000 at the lrz in munich .",
    "this work is supported by gsi .",
    "in section [ sectmethod ] , we derived the exact relations ( [ postdiluting ] ) and ( [ postdiluting2 ] ) for the blocks of the quark propagator . in those derivations we relied upon the following property of the random vectors",
    "@xmath81 : @xmath82 but there also exist other possibilities to derive the same results",
    ".      the dirac propagator , @xmath19 , can be represented by a path integral in the following way @xmath83 [ d\\bar{\\psi } ] \\psi_i \\bar{\\psi}_j e^{-s_{f } } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 [ d\\bar{\\psi } ] e^{-s_{f } } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the partition function , @xmath85 is the fermion action @xmath86 and @xmath87 = \\prod_k d\\psi_k$ ] is the integration measure .",
    "the first step in our alternative approach is to split the fermion action into a sum of four separate contributions : @xmath88 the leading two contributions are only connecting the fermion fields within the regions @xmath17 ( @xmath89 ) and @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , while the other two contributions provide the connections between the regions . in a similar way",
    ", one can also divide the integration measures in eqs .",
    "( [ fermpath ] ) and ( [ fermpartition ] ) .    when one now considers the special case of eq .",
    "( [ fermpath ] ) when @xmath92 and @xmath93 and uses expression ( [ splitaction ] ) the propagator becomes @xmath94 [ d\\bar{\\psi } ] \\psi_1 \\bar{\\psi}_2 \\,e^{-s_{f } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{1}{z } \\int [ d\\psi_2 ] [ d\\bar{\\psi}_2 ] \\bar{\\psi}_2 \\,e^{-\\bar{\\psi}_2 m_{22 } \\psi_{2 } } \\times \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\;\\ ; \\int [ d\\psi_1 ] [ d\\bar{\\psi}_1 ] \\psi_1 \\ , e^{-\\bar{\\psi}_1 m_{11 } \\psi_{1 } - \\bar{\\psi}_1 m_{12 } \\psi_{2 } - \\bar{\\psi}_2 m_{21 } \\psi_{1 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{det(m_{11})}{z } \\int [ d\\psi_2 ] [ d\\bar{\\psi}_2 ] \\bar{\\psi}_2 ( - m^{-1}_{11 } m_{12 } \\psi_{2 } ) \\,e^{-\\bar{\\psi}_2 \\tilde{m}_{22 } \\psi_{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{det(m_{11 } ) det(\\tilde{m}_{22})}{z } m^{-1}_{11 } m_{12 } \\tilde{m}^{-1}_{22 } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 and @xmath95 are the diagonal blocks of a decomposed version of @xmath20 with 0 s as off - diagonal blocks .",
    "therefore , @xmath96 and the ratio becomes 1 . for the next to last step , we completed the square in the exponent and performed a shift of the integration measure .        c.  michael and j.  peisa [ ukqcd collaboration ] , phys .",
