    "[ fig : photon_spectrum_and_models ] , we only show the angle - averaged model spectra ; the viewing angle effect is considered later .",
    "both models have @xmath70(@xmath9ni ) @xmath63 , which is consistent with what is inferred from optical properties ( e.g. , peak luminosity ) of sn 2014j @xcite .",
    "the photon flux at 170 - 250 kev , taking our @xmath2 signal , is indeed consistent with these models , within a systematic error related to the cxb . above @xmath71 kev ,",
    "the nominal flux level in the _ suzaku _ spectrum is above the level of the cxb ( for both cxb models ) , leaving no residual sn2014j signal contribution , within uncertainties .",
    "the most important difference in these two models is the total mass of the exploding system .",
    "the w7 model @xcite is a representative of an explosion of a single chandrasekhar - mass wd and the expected @xmath0-ray emission is similar to other model variants such as deflagration - detonation models in a chandrasekhar - mass @xcite . on the other hand , in the violent merger model both of the ( sub - chandrasekhar - mass ) wds",
    "are disrupted , leading to the super - chandrasekhar mass for this particular model presented here @xcite . in terms of the expected @xmath0-ray signals ,",
    "the two models are characterized by different optical depth to @xmath0-rays through compton scattering .",
    "the violent merger model has more massive ejecta and thus is more opaque ( by a factor of about two ) , leading to a higher level of compton continuum in the energy range of _ suzaku _ observations .",
    "this difference is seen in figure [ fig : photon_spectrum_and_models ] .",
    "figure [ fig : discuss_fluxratio ] shows the light curves integrated in the energy range of @xmath72 kev for various models , as well as the evolution of the ratio of the same continuum flux to the 847 kev line flux .",
    "the _ suzaku _ upper limit and @xmath11 data are also plotted as an one snapshot point at @xmath7 days thanks to the low - background capability of the hxd .",
    "for the ratio , we took the flux from the _ integral _ observation at @xmath73 days after the explosion @xcite .",
    "we adopt the energy range of @xmath72 kev since this corresponds to the marginally detected signal by _ suzaku _ at @xmath2 . shown in the figure",
    "are the w7 model , 2d delayed detonation models @xcite and the violent merger model of @xcite for which gamma - ray observables have been presented by @xcite .",
    "the delayed detonation models were computed for different initial conditions ( always with the assumption of a chandrasekhar - mass wd ) , covering a wide range of @xmath70(@xmath9ni ) .",
    "the models with @xmath70(@xmath9ni ) @xmath74 are indicated by yellow curves , and the w7 model and the violent merger model both have @xmath23 of @xmath9ni synthesized in the explosion .",
    "these are models compatible to the optical features of sn 2014j .",
    "the emission from the violent merger model is sensitive to the viewing angle even at @xmath75 days , and thus this is shown for various viewing angles .",
    "it is seen that for a similar amount of @xmath9ni , the violent merger model having super - chandrasekhar mass in the total ejecta , predicts a larger flux than the models with chandrasekhar - mass wd progenitors .",
    "this is a result of the larger optical depth as explained above . within the observational error ,",
    "all the models are consistent with the _ suzaku _ data .",
    "the difference between the violent merger model and the other explosion models becomes clearer in the evolution of the flux ratio .",
    "indeed , the ratio of the continuum flux to the line flux has been suggested to be a diagnostic to distinguish the progenitor wd mass @xcite  in case of two models producing the similar amount of @xmath9ni , a larger amount of material surrounding the radioactive isotopes ( for the larger wd mass ) will convert a larger fraction of the line flux to the compton down - scattered continuum flux .",
    "therefore the ratio of the continuum to the line flux directly mirrors the ejecta mass .",
    "this shows that it is in principle possible to constrain the total mass of the ejecta , thus the mass of the progenitor wd , through @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainty in the _ suzaku _ observation turned out to be too large to discriminate the models , even if we adopt the @xmath11 error rather than the @xmath3 upper limit .",
    "unfortunately no constraint is obtained at a @xmath3 level , but it could already start to constrain some extreme models while at a @xmath11 level ; the ratio predicted for some 2d delayed detonation models is below the _ suzaku _ point beyond @xmath11 error ( i.e. , the yellow lines below the data point in the lower panel of figure 9 ) , irrespective of the cxb model .",
    "all of these models have @xmath70(@xmath9ni ) @xmath76 .",
    "these models have an extended distribution in @xmath9ni , and thus have small optical depths , leading to a low ratio .",
    "we thus reject , while at a @xmath11 level , the models with such a large amount of @xmath9ni from the @xmath0-ray signal alone fully independently of the optical emission .",
    "very few models are reported for cxb emission in an energy band above 100 kev . in section [ section :",
    "analysis : background ] , the hard x - ray spectrum with the hxd gso in the 100  500 kev band is presented in figure [ fig : spec_sn2014j_cxb ] and compared with the canonical cxb model by @xcite . in the following fittings , the earth s albedo emission estimated in section [ section : analysis : nxb ] is added to the nxb - subtracted spectrum of the blank sky observations .",
    "overall uncertainties on cxb model ( 10 % from @xcite ) , angular response matrix ( 4 % due to shade structure opaque to the sun in the x - ray mirror in figure 11 of @xcite ) , nxb estimation ( 0.19% from section [ section : analysis : nxb ] ) , and earth s albedo emission ( 25% from section [ section : analysis : nxb ] ) , are also included .",
    "if we assume that the spectral shape of cxb is given by @xcite , the x - ray flux of the hxd / gso blank - sky observation becomes @xmath77 times larger than the value of gruber model .",
    "numerically , it is @xmath78 ph s@xmath5 @xmath6 str@xmath5 or @xmath79 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 str@xmath5 in the 200  500 kev band , where the errors represent statistics only .",
    "if we reproduce the blank - sky spectrum with a simple power - law model , the photon index becomes harder than that of @xcite at @xmath80 and the x - ray flux becomes consistent with @xcite at @xmath81 ph s@xmath5 @xmath6 str@xmath5 or @xmath82 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 str@xmath5 in the 200  500 kev band , whereas the gruber model corresponds to @xmath83 ph s@xmath5 @xmath6 str@xmath5 or @xmath84 erg s@xmath5 @xmath6 str@xmath5 in the same energy band .",
    "therefore , the x - ray spectrum of the blank sky observation with gso reproduces the cxb model by @xcite within statistical errors .      a next - generation x - ray satellite _ hitomi _ ( named _ astro - h _ before launch ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been successfully launched on 17 feb 2016 and higher sensitivities than those of the hxd pin / gso or spi / isgri on _ integral _ will be achieved soon . the background level of the soft gamma - ray detector ( sgd ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) onboard _ hitomi _ will be reduced by one order of magnitude compared to the hxd and therefore soft @xmath0-ray spectra from a future close - by type - ia sne can be precisely measured as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "thus , we can distinguish the explosion models between single and double degenerate progenitors as indicated in figure [ fig : discuss_fluxratio ] . in distinctions of explosion models on figure [ fig : discuss_fluxratio ] ,",
