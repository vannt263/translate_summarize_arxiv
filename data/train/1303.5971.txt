    "power laws with non integer exponents are common in the study of scale invariant structures , in particular in the theory of critical phenomena at second order phase transitions . in some cases , when the scale invariance is discrete @xcite",
    ", the amplitude of the powerlaw acquires a periodicity , often called log - periodic oscillations : see @xcite for reviews on the topic .",
    "these oscillatory amplitudes are usually more difficult to calculate @xcite than the critical exponents .",
    "when the scale invariance is associated to a renormalization group map , they can be related to some properties of the map , for example to the shape of its julia set , see @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to show that these oscillatory amplitudes can be computed perturbatively when the unperturbed map is simple enough , in our case a monomial map . to be more precise",
    "let us consider the following question : take the map @xmath1 with @xmath2 where @xmath3 and the perturbation @xmath4    is sufficiently regular and has a finite limit for @xmath5 ( we will actually need a condition on the decay of @xmath6 too , and this will be pointed out later on , see ) . if @xmath7 is the largest real fixed point of the map ( so that , this fixed point is unstable , that is @xmath8 , for @xmath9 sufficiently small .",

    "the existence of the limit directly follows from @xmath22 it is straightforward to see that the limit satisfies the functional equation @xmath23 which goes under the name of bttcher equation in the iterated function literature @xcite , and one expects and sometime can prove ",
    "see for example @xcite  that @xmath24 where the exponent @xmath25 is usually non - integer and @xmath26 is a strictly positive periodic function of period one.the exponent @xmath27 has the well known expression @xmath28 while the oscillatory amplitude @xmath29 is usually hard to determine .",
    "one goal of the present paper is to show how to compute this oscillatory amplitude perturbatively ( related small @xmath30 expansions can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec : main ] that all the subdominant corrections to ( [ crit-1 ] ) can be calculated as well since they all can be expressed in terms of the periodic function @xmath26 .",
    "is easily guessed : if one assumes that as @xmath31 , with @xmath32 defined for @xmath33 for an arbitrary choice of @xmath34 , continuous and such that @xmath35 , one gets from that @xmath36 and this implies the value ( [ alpha ] ) of @xmath25 and the fact @xmath37 for every @xmath38 , that is that @xmath39 is multiplicatively periodic of period @xmath40 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath41 , with @xmath26 periodic of period one , as in ( [ crit-1 ] ) .",
    "in what follows we will often assume that @xmath42 so that @xmath43 when @xmath30 is sufficiently small .",
    "there is no loss of generality in doing so because the general case can be reduced to @xmath44 by the change of variable @xmath45 and @xmath7 can easily be computed perturbatively in @xmath30 @xmath46    in this paper we will also discuss the case where the map @xmath10 has the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a large positive integer , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is a polynomial such that @xmath51 .",

    "we will see that for large @xmath48 the oscillatory amplitude can be sharply estimated . in a nutshell ,",
    "the reason why the map becomes amenable for large @xmath48 is that sharp estimates of the iterated map @xmath56 are easy as long as @xmath57 is very close to @xmath7  the linear regime  and when @xmath57 is large , because the map there is close to @xmath58 .",
    "the only difficult part of the iteration is in between these two regimes : we will see however that for @xmath48 large this intermediate regime essentially reduces to one iteration which one performs explicitly .",
    "let us discuss here briefly two different examples where the above question is relevant .",
    "one of the developments in the theory of critical phenomena by the renormalization group approach was to study statistical mechanical models on hierarchical lattices @xcite .",
    "these lattices are usually constructed by a recursive procedure which is at the origin of a discrete scale invariance and which allows one to write exact renormalization transformations .    here",
    "we consider the so - called diamond lattice @xcite ( in fact a generalization of it ) which is constructed as follows .",
    "one starts with a lattice composed of a single bond between two sites @xmath59 and @xmath60 . then at every iteration",
    "step each bond of the previous step is replaced by @xmath61 bonds , namely by @xmath62 parallel paths of @xmath48 bonds each . therefore if , at step @xmath63 , one starts with a single bond between @xmath59 and @xmath60 ,",
    "then , after @xmath13 iterations , there are @xmath64 bonds in the lattice , @xmath65 directed paths from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , and each of these directed paths has a length @xmath66 .",
    "one of the simplest critical phenomenon one may consider on such a hierarchical lattice is the wetting transition @xcite : in the wetting problem , all the bonds along a single path ( the special path ) from @xmath59 to @xmath60 have an energy @xmath67 whereas all the remaining bonds on the lattice have energy @xmath63 .",
    "the energy @xmath68 of a path @xmath69 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 is simply the number of bonds it has in common with the special path .",
    "equivalently this energy @xmath68 is the sum of the energies of the bonds visited by the path @xmath69 .",
    "then the partition function , at temperature @xmath70 , is defined as @xmath71 where the sum is over all the @xmath72 paths @xmath69 .",
    "when the temperature varies , one observes a transition between a bound phase , where typical paths have a non zero fraction of their length in common with the special path , to a free phase where this fraction vanishes . at infinite temperature ,",
    "all paths have weight @xmath53 and the partition function counts simply the total number @xmath73 of paths @xmath74 while at finite temperature , the partition function satisfies the following recursion @xmath75 if one introduces the ratio @xmath76 , it follows that @xmath77 with @xmath78 . at the @xmath13-th",
    "step the free energy @xmath79 per unit length is @xmath80 which implies for the large @xmath13 limit @xmath81 of @xmath79 ( recall and ) @xmath82 note that , while from the construction of the lattice @xmath83 is an integer , the iteration ( [ hl ] ) makes sense for every @xmath84 .",
    "in what follows we will consider this generalization ( see remark  [ rem : diamond - gw ] for another probabilistic interpretation of @xmath85 in this generalized context ) .",
    "finding the critical behavior of the free energy when the temperature is close to the wetting transition temperature , i.e. when @xmath86 is close to the fixed point @xmath7 of the map @xmath14 , is a problem of the same nature as the one posed in the introduction and the question we address here is to try to determine the periodic function @xmath26 in front of the power law singularity @xmath87    the map ( [ hl ] ) can be reduced to the form ( [ f - def ] ) or in the two following cases    * when @xmath62 is close to @xmath53 or when @xmath62 is large , by making the change of variable @xmath88 , the map ( [ hl ] ) becomes @xmath89 which is of the form ( [ f - def ] ) .",
    "* when @xmath62 is arbitrary and @xmath48 is large , because the application ( [ hl ] ) coincides with , with the choice @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "[ rem : nb ] it is worth pointing out that the partition function of the wetting model on more general hierarchical lattices is obtained by iterating a polynomial of the form @xmath92 , with the @xmath93 s probability weights . of course @xmath94 and it is easy to see that there is at most another positive root : recall that the unstable fixed point @xmath7 on which we focus is the largest positive root .",
    "we record here the well known formula ( e.g. @xcite ) that actually holds for every @xmath95 @xmath96 with @xmath97 .",
    "it is rather straightforward to extract from this formula that @xmath98 is ( real ) analytic on @xmath99 ( e.g. @xcite ) : in statistical mechanics terms this says that @xmath7 is the only critical point ( note that with the definition ( [ psi - n - def ] , [ psi - inf - def ] ) one has @xmath100 for @xmath101 $ ] ) .",
    "the galton process is a simple model for the size of the lineage of an individual @xcite .",
    "the generations do not overlap and all the population is replaced at every generation .",
    "one starts with a single individual at generation @xmath102 .",
    "then each individual living at generation @xmath103 has a probability @xmath104 of having @xmath105 offspring at the next generation @xmath106",
    ". therefore if @xmath107 is the number of individuals at generation @xmath103 ( so @xmath108 ) , one has @xmath109 where the @xmath110 s are @xmath111 independent random variables which take the value @xmath105 with a probability @xmath104 .",
    "the size @xmath107 of the population at generation @xmath103 is therefore a random variable .",
    "the average number of offsprings at generation @xmath103 is ( see ( [ recurs ] ) ) given by @xmath112 so the expected size of the population grows exponentially for @xmath113 .",
    "it is well known , see e.g. @xcite , that if @xmath114 then after sufficiently many generations the population goes extinct",
    ". we will actually restrict to the _ supercritical _ case @xmath113 and in this context it is natural to define @xcite the generating function of the ratio @xmath115 @xmath116 one can see from ( [ recurs ] ) that @xmath117 where @xmath118",
    ". then @xmath119 satisfies @xmath120 this functional equation is known under the name of poincar equation @xcite and @xmath121 is the unique solution of which is analytic in a neighborhood of the origin and such that @xmath122 and @xmath123 @xcite . note that that , given @xmath124 and @xmath125 , one can extract recursively from ( [ eq : poincare ] ) all the coefficients of the taylor expansion at @xmath126 .",
    "[ rem : w ] to be precise , the limit exists in great generality and it is ( obviously ) finite if @xmath127 ( * ? ? ?",
    "i ) . in fact",
    "the random variable @xmath128 converges almost surely to a limit random variable @xmath129 as soon as @xmath130 : this is particularly elementary if @xmath131 , because in this case one can explicitly compute @xmath132 for @xmath133 @xcite and establish the convergence ( in probability ) of @xmath134 to @xmath129 and the fact that @xmath129 is not identically zero .",
    "of course in this generality @xmath135 can be @xmath136 for @xmath137 , but we will focus on the case in which only a finite number of @xmath104 s are non zero and it is therefore rather straightforward to see that for every @xmath137 there exists @xmath138 such that @xmath139 this not only implies that @xmath140 is finite for every @xmath141 and that it is equal to @xmath142 , but also that the same is true for any @xmath143 complex : as a matter of fact @xmath121 is an entire function , that is analytic on the whole of @xmath144 .",
    "let us therefore assume that only a finite number of @xmath104 s are non zero , so that the map @xmath10 is polynomial of degree @xmath145 .",
    "t. e. harris has proven @xcite that for large @xmath143 @xmath146 with @xmath147 as in ( [ alpha ] ) and @xmath148 a continuous positive periodic function of period @xmath53 .",
    "harris was unable to establish that @xmath148 is not a constant as soon as @xmath149 ( for @xmath150 , that is for @xmath151 , it is straightforward to see that @xmath148 is constant ) and this open issue has drawn the attention in the mathematical community ( see for example @xcite , dealing precisely with the problem left open by harris ) and similar  sometimes strictly related  oscillatory behaviors have been pointed out repeatedly ( e.g. @xcite and @xcite for further references : the stress is often on the _ nearly constant _ and _ nearly sinusoidal _",
    "character of these oscillations ) . to our knowledge , establishing in general that @xmath148 is non constant is still an open problem for @xmath152 ( for @xmath153 the non triviality of @xmath148 is established in @xcite by exploiting results in @xcite ) .    here",
    "again one can try to perturb around a situation where the map becomes simple .",
    "however there is the following important preliminary issue : what is the relation , if any , between the periodic functions @xmath26 and @xmath148 , both of period one , appearing in and in .",
    "a priori , these two periodic function come out of different questions that have in common only the underlying polynomial @xmath14 .",
    "but in fact if the polynomial is the same in the two questions , then the periodic functions coincide up to the change of variable @xmath154 ( this has been proven in @xcite and the need for switching the sign is due to the way we have defined @xmath26 and @xmath148 : the argument of proof is reproduced below ) . given this observation ,",
    "the analysis of @xmath26 and @xmath148 in the two perturbative limits we consider becomes just one problem .",
    "we explain now how , by exploiting the two functional equations and , one can see that the periodic function @xmath26 in and @xmath148 in coincide up to a sign change in the argument . for this",
    "we fix a polynomial @xmath155 , like in remark  [ rem : nb ] for the wetting model and in remark  [ rem : w ] for the galton - watson process , and we define for every @xmath137 @xmath156 and by applying first together with @xmath157 , and then we have @xmath158 that is , @xmath159 is multiplicatively periodic of period @xmath160 .",
    "moreover @xmath159 is analytic on @xmath161 because @xmath121 is entire ( cf .",
    "remark  [ rem : w ] ) and @xmath98 is analytic on @xmath162 ( cf .",
    "remark  [ rem : nb ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath163 on @xmath161 is just the strict positivity of @xmath164 for @xmath165 and the fact that @xmath166 for @xmath137 .",
    "now from the definitions it is immediate to see that @xmath167 for @xmath5 and that @xmath168 , so @xmath169 which provides a proof of and relates explicitly @xmath159 and @xmath148 . on the other hand can be rewritten as @xmath170 but since @xmath122 and @xmath171 , we see that @xmath172 for @xmath173 , so that from one directly obtains for @xmath174 @xmath175 which proves and explicitly relates @xmath26 to @xmath159 , and we see that @xmath176 for every @xmath38 .",
    "this completes the proof of the equivalence of the two example models we have proposed , as far as oscillations are concerned .",
    "[ rem : diamond - gw ] as it was pointed out in @xcite , the partition function of the hierarchical wetting model has a galton - watson representation : @xmath177 formula shows that the partition function of the hierarchical wetting model can be interpreted as the generating function of the size @xmath178 of the population at the @xmath13-th generation of a galton - watson processes .",
    "it also provides an expression for the partition function of the hierarchical model in terms of sum of boltzmann weights when @xmath62 is not integer .",
    "here instead of writing the results in terms of the difference @xmath179 , we found slightly more convenient to use @xmath180 .",
    "one can of course make a simple change of variables to rewrite the final result in terms of the difference @xmath179 .",
