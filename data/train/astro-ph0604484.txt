    "<S> the holographic dark energy model is an attempt for probing the nature of dark energy within the framework of quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 determines the main property of the holographic dark energy . with the choice of @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , the holographic dark energy can be described completely by a quintessence scalar field . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show this quintessential description of the holographic dark energy with @xmath1 and reconstruct the potential of the quintessence as well as the dynamics of the scalar field .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been confirmed admittedly that our universe is experiencing an accelerating expansion at the present time , by many cosmological experiments , such as observations of large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite , searches for type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , and measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this cosmic acceleration observed strongly supports the existence of a mysterious exotic matter , dark energy , with large enough negative pressure , whose energy density has been a dominative power of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the astrophysical feature of dark energy is that it remains unclustered at all scales where gravitational clustering of baryons and nonbaryonic cold dark matter can be seen . </S>",
    "<S> its gravity effect is shown as a repulsive force so as to make the expansion of the universe accelerate when its energy density becomes dominative power of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the combined analysis of cosmological observations suggests that the universe is spatially flat , and consists of about @xmath2 dark energy , @xmath3 dust matter ( cold dark matter plus baryons ) , and negligible radiation . </S>",
    "<S> although we can affirm that the ultimate fate of the universe is determined by the feature of dark energy , the nature of dark energy as well as its cosmological origin remain enigmatic at present . however </S>",
    "<S> , we still can propose some candidates to interpret or describe the properties of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious theoretical candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath4 ( vacuum energy ) @xcite which has the equation of state @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> however , as is well known , there are two difficulties arise from the cosmological constant scenario , namely the two famous cosmological constant problems  the `` fine - tuning '' problem and the `` cosmic coincidence '' problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fine - tuning problem asks why the vacuum energy density today is so small compared to typical particle scales . </S>",
    "<S> the vacuum energy density is of order @xmath6 , which appears to require the introduction of a new mass scale 14 or so orders of magnitude smaller than the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the second difficulty , the cosmic coincidence problem , says : since the energy densities of vacuum energy and dark matter scale so differently during the expansion history of the universe , why are they nearly equal today ? to get this coincidence , it appears that their ratio must be set to a specific , infinitesimal value in the very early universe .    </S>",
    "<S> theorists have made lots of efforts to try to resolve the cosmological constant problem , but all these efforts were turned out to be unsuccessful . </S>",
    "<S> of course the theoretical consideration is still in process and has made some progresses . in recent years , many string theorists have devoted to understand and shed light on the cosmological constant or dark energy within the string framework . </S>",
    "<S> the famous kachru - kallosh - linde - trivedi ( kklt ) model @xcite is a typical example , which tries to construct metastable de sitter vacua in the light of type iib string theory . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , string landscape idea @xcite has been proposed for shedding light on the cosmological constant problem based upon the anthropic principle and multiverse speculation </S>",
    "<S> . however , there remain other candidates to explaining dark energy .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative proposal for dark energy is the dynamical dark energy scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constant puzzles may be better interpreted by assuming that the vacuum energy is canceled to exactly zero by some unknown mechanism and introducing a dark energy component with a dynamically variable equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical dark energy proposal is often realized by some scalar field mechanism which suggests that the energy form with negative pressure is provided by a scalar field evolving down a proper potential . </S>",
    "<S> actually , this mechanism is enlightened to a great extent by the inflationary cosmology . as we have known , the occurrence of the current accelerating expansion of the universe is not the first time in the expansion history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> there is significant observational evidence strongly supporting that the universe underwent an early inflationary epoch , over sufficiently small time scales , during which its expansion rapidly accelerated under the driven of an `` inflaton '' field which had properties similar to those of a cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> the inflaton field , to some extent , can be viewed as a kind of dynamically evolving dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the scalar field models involving a minimally coupled scalar field are proposed , inspired by inflationary cosmology , to construct dynamically evolving models of dark energy . the only difference between the dynamical scalar - field dark energy and the inflaton is the energy scale they possess . </S>",
    "<S> famous examples of scalar - field dark energy models include quintessence @xcite , @xmath7-essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , phantom @xcite , ghost condensate @xcite and quintom @xcite , and so forth . </S>",
    "<S> generically , there are two points of view on the scalar - field models of dynamical dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> one viewpoint regards the scalar field as a fundamental field of the nature . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of dark energy is , according to this viewpoint , completely attributed to some fundamental scalar field which is omnipresent in supersymmetric field theories and in string / m theory . </S>",
    "<S> the other viewpoint supports that the scalar field model is an effective description of an underlying theory of dark energy . on the whole </S>",
    "<S> , it seems that the latter is the mainstream point of view . </S>",
    "<S> since we regard the scalar field model as an effective description of an underlying theory of dark energy , a question arises asking : what is the underlying theory of the dark energy ? </S>",
    "<S> of course , hitherto , this question is far beyond our present knowledge , because that we can not entirely understand the nature of dark energy before a complete theory of quantum gravity is established . </S>",
    "<S> however , although we are lacking a quantum gravity theory today , we still can make some attempts to probe the nature of dark energy according to some principles of quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic dark energy model is just an appropriate example , which is constructed in the light of the holographic principle of quantum gravity theory . </S>",
    "<S> that is to say , the holographic dark energy model possesses some significant features of an underlying theory of dark energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the distinctive feature of the cosmological constant or vacuum energy is that its equation of state is always exactly equal to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> however , when considering the requirement of the holographic principle originating from the quantum gravity speculation , the vacuum energy will become dynamically evolving dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> actually , the dark energy problem may be in principle a problem belongs to quantum gravity @xcite . in the classical gravity theory , one can always introduce a cosmological constant to make the dark energy density be an arbitrary value </S>",
    "<S> . however , a complete theory of quantum gravity should be capable of making the property of dark energy , such as the energy density and the equation of state , be determined definitely and uniquely @xcite . currently , an interesting attempt for probing the nature of dark energy within the framework of quantum gravity is the so - called `` holographic dark energy '' proposal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the holographic principle is an important result of the recent researches for exploring the quantum gravity ( or string theory ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this principle is enlightened by investigations of the quantum property of black holes . roughly speaking , in a quantum gravity system </S>",
    "<S> , the conventional local quantum field theory will break down . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is rather simple : for a quantum gravity system , the conventional local quantum field theory contains too many degrees of freedom , and so many degrees of freedom will lead to the formation of black hole so as to break down the effectiveness of the quantum field theory .    for an effective field theory in a box of size @xmath9 , with uv cut - off @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> the entropy @xmath11 scales extensively , @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the peculiar thermodynamics of black hole @xcite has led bekenstein to postulate that the maximum entropy in a box of volume @xmath13 behaves nonextensively , growing only as the area of the box , i.e. there is a so - called bekenstein entropy bound , @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this nonextensive scaling suggests that quantum field theory breaks down in large volume . to reconcile this breakdown with the success of local quantum field theory in describing observed particle phenomenology , cohen et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite proposed a more restrictive bound  the energy bound . </S>",
    "<S> they pointed out that in quantum field theory a short distance ( uv ) cut - off is related to a long distance ( ir ) cut - off due to the limit set by forming a black hole . in other words , if the quantum zero - point energy density @xmath15 is relevant to a uv cut - off , the total energy of the whole system with size @xmath9 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus we have @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the maximum entropy is in order of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> when we take the whole universe into account , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle @xcite is viewed as dark energy , usually dubbed holographic dark energy . the largest ir cut - off @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> is chosen by saturating the inequality so that we get the holographic dark energy density @xmath18 where @xmath0 is a numerical constant , and @xmath19 is the reduced planck mass . if we take @xmath9 as the size of the current universe , for instance the hubble scale @xmath20 , then the dark energy density will be close to the observational result . </S>",
    "<S> however , hsu @xcite pointed out that this yields a wrong equation of state for dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> li @xcite subsequently proposed that the ir cut - off @xmath9 should be taken as the size of the future event horizon @xmath21 then the problem can be solved nicely and the holographic dark energy model can thus be constructed successfully . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic dark energy scenario may provide simultaneously natural solutions to both dark energy problems as demonstrated in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic dark energy model has been tested and constrained by various astronomical observations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for other extensive studies , see e.g. @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now a spatially flat frw ( friedmann - robertson - walker ) universe with matter component @xmath22 ( including both baryon matter and cold dark matter ) and holographic dark energy component @xmath15 , the friedmann equation reads @xmath23 or equivalently , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the redshift of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> note that we always assume spatial flatness throughout this paper as motivated by inflation . </S>",
    "<S> combining the definition of the holographic dark energy ( [ de ] ) and the definition of the future event horizon ( [ eh ] ) , we derive @xmath26 we notice that the friedmann equation ( [ ez ] ) implies @xmath27 substituting ( [ fri ] ) into ( [ rh ] ) , one obtains the following equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 . then taking derivative with respect to @xmath30 in both sides of the above relation </S>",
    "<S> , we get easily the dynamics satisfied by the dark energy , i.e. the differential equation about the fractional density of dark energy , @xmath31 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the redshift @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this equation describes behavior of the holographic dark energy completely , and it can be solved exactly @xcite . from the energy conservation equation of the dark energy , the equation of state of the dark energy can be given @xcite @xmath33 note that the formula @xmath34 and the differential equation of @xmath35 ( [ deq ] ) are used in the second equal sign . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen clearly that the equation of state of the holographic dark energy evolves dynamically and satisfies @xmath36 due to @xmath37 . hence , we see clearly that when taking the holographic principle into account the vacuum energy becomes dynamically evolving dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 plays a significant role in this model . </S>",
    "<S> if one takes @xmath38 , the behavior of the holographic dark energy will be more and more like a cosmological constant with the expansion of the universe , such that ultimately the universe will enter the de sitter phase in the far future . </S>",
    "<S> as is shown in @xcite , if one puts the parameter @xmath39 into ( [ w ] ) , then a definite prediction of this model , @xmath40 , will be given . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , if @xmath41 , the holographic dark energy will exhibit appealing behavior that the equation of state crosses the `` cosmological - constant boundary '' ( or `` phantom divide '' ) @xmath5 during the evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of dark energy is referred to as `` quintom '' @xcite which is slightly favored by current observations @xcite . for extensive studies on quintom model </S>",
    "<S> see e.g. @xcite . if @xmath42 , the equation of state of dark energy will be always larger than @xmath8 such that the universe avoids entering the de sitter phase and the big rip phase . hence , we see explicitly , the value of @xmath0 is very important for the holographic dark energy model , which determines the feature of the holographic dark energy as well as the ultimate fate of the universe . as an illustrative example , we plot in figure [ fig : wevolv ] the selected evolutions of the equation of state of holographic dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> we show in the plot the cases of @xmath43 , 1.1 , 1.2 and 0.9 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear to see that the cases in @xmath44 always evolve in the region of @xmath45 , whereas the case of @xmath41 behaves as a quintom whose equation of state @xmath46 crosses the cosmological constant boundary @xmath8 during the evolution .    , and </S>",
    "<S> show the cases for @xmath43 , 1.1 , 1.2 and 0.9 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the cases in @xmath44 behave as holographic quintessence , and the case of @xmath41 behaves as holographic quintom . ]    </S>",
    "<S> as has been analyzed above , the holographic dark energy scenario reveals the dynamical nature of the vacuum energy . </S>",
    "<S> when taking the holographic principle into account , the vacuum energy density will evolve dynamically . on the other hand , as has already mentioned , the scalar field dark energy models are often viewed as effective description of the underlying theory of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , the underlying theory of dark energy can not be achieved before a complete theory of quantum gravity is established . </S>",
    "<S> we can , nevertheless , speculate on the underlying theory of dark energy by taking some principles of quantum gravity into account . </S>",
    "<S> the holographic dark energy model is no doubt a tentative in this way . </S>",
    "<S> we are now interested in that if we assume the holographic vacuum energy scenario as the underlying theory of dark energy , how the scalar field model can be used to effectively describe it .    </S>",
    "<S> the quintessence scalar field @xmath47 evolves in its potential @xmath48 and seeks to roll towards the minimum of the potential , according to the klein - gordon equation @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of evolution is driven by the slope of the potential and damped by the cosmic expansion through the hubble parameter @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy density and pressure are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , so that the equation of state of quintessence @xmath53 evolves in a region of @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> usually , for making the universe s expansion accelerate , it should be required that @xmath55 must satisfy @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it can be seen clearly that the quintessence scalar field can not realize the equation of state crossing @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , only the holographic dark energy in cases of @xmath44 can be described by the quintessence .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us see the constraint results for the holographic dark energy model from the observational data . when combining the information from snia @xcite , cmb @xcite and lss @xcite , the fitting for the holographic dark energy model gives the parameter constraints in 1 @xmath57 : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , with @xmath60 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . in this joint analysis , the snia data come from the 157 `` gold '' data @xcite including 14 high redshift data from the _ hubble space telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> ( hst)/great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) program and previous data , the cmb information comes from the measured value of the cmb shift parameter @xmath61 given by @xcite @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the redshift of recombination , and the lss information is provided by the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement @xcite @xmath64^{2/3}=0.469\\pm 0.017 $ ] , where @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the x - ray gas mass fraction of rich clusters , as a function of redshift , has also been used to constrain the holographic dark energy model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath66 values are provided by _ </S>",
    "<S> chandra _ </S>",
    "<S> observational data , the x - ray gas mass fraction of 26 rich clusters , released by allen et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main results , i.e. the 1 @xmath57 fit values for @xmath0 and @xmath67 are : @xmath68 and @xmath69 , with the best - fit chi - square @xmath70 @xcite . we see that , basically , in one - sigma error range , the holographic dark energy will behave as quintom - like dark energy whose equation - of - state crosses the @xmath5 line during the evolution . : @xmath71 and @xmath72 . that is to say , </S>",
    "<S> though the possibility of @xmath41 is more favored , the possibility of @xmath42 can not be excluded in one - sigma error range . </S>",
    "<S> so , according to the new data , the evidence for the quintom feature in the holographic dark energy model is not as strong as before . ]    on the other hand , even though the current observational data indicate that the parameter @xmath0 in the holographic model seems smaller than 1 , the possibility of @xmath44 can not be ruled out yet . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for the upper limit of the error one sigma , @xmath73 in the result of the joint analysis of snia+cmb+lss ; @xmath74 in the result of the analysis of x - ray gas data . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it must be pointed out that the choice of @xmath41 , on theoretical level , will bring some troubles . </S>",
    "<S> the cases of @xmath41 will lead to dark energy behaving as a phantom eventually , which violates the weak energy condition of general relativity , also violates the null energy condition , which has been significant subject of investigations , see @xcite for example . in @xcite , the authors show that violation of the null energy condition implies instability in a broad class of models , which indicates for dark energy that @xmath46 is unlikely to be less than @xmath8 . ] and the gibbons - hawking entropy will thus decrease since the event horizon shrinks , which violates the second law of thermodynamics as well . besides , the quantum instability may often be encountered in quintom models when the @xmath5 crossing happens . </S>",
    "<S> what is more , when the future event horizon as the ir cut - off becomes shorter than the uv cut - off within a finite time in the future , the definition of the holographic dark energy will break down . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , from a theoretical viewpoint , the choice of @xmath44 , especially of @xmath38 , is more appropriate . for the favor of @xmath41 from the currently available observational data , </S>",
    "<S> a possible interpretation says that this maybe a gloss due to lack of sufficiently precise data . </S>",
    "<S> anyway , the holographic dark energy with @xmath44 , especially with @xmath38 , seems reasonable from theoretical viewpoint . </S>",
    "<S> one the whole , since the data analysis can not rule out the possibility of @xmath44 completely , the cases of @xmath44 are worth investigating in detail . we can establish a correspondence between the holographic dark energy with @xmath44 and quintessence scalar field , and describe holographic dark energy in this case effectively by making use of quintessence . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this case as `` holographic quintessence '' .     </S>",
    "<S> is in unit of @xmath75 and @xmath48 in @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> we take here @xmath77 . ]     for the holographic quintessence , where @xmath47 is in unit of @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> we take here @xmath79 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the quintessence potential @xmath48 can be reconstructed from supernova observational data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , from some specific parametrization forms of the equation of state @xmath80 , one can also reconstruct the quintessence potential @xmath48 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction method can also be generalized to scalar - tensor theories @xcite , @xmath81 gravity @xcite , a dark energy fluid with viscosity terms @xcite , and also the generalized ghost condensate model @xcite . for a reconstruction program for a very general scalar - field lagrangian density see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , the holographic dark energy possesses some significant features of the quantum gravity theory . </S>",
    "<S> so , to some extent , we can regard the holographic vacuum energy scenario as an underlying theory of dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar - field dark energy model then can be considered as an effective description of this holographic theory . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath41 in the holographic scenario , the quintom - like behavior will occur , and we refer to this case as `` holographic quintom '' . </S>",
    "<S> the reconstruction of the scalar - field model ( the generalized ghost condensate model ) according to the holographic quintom has been investigated in detail in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now we are focussing on the reconstruction of the holographic quintessence . </S>",
    "<S> we shall reconstruct the quintessence potential and the dynamics of the scalar field in the light of the holographic dark energy with @xmath44 . according to the forms of quintessence energy density and pressure </S>",
    "<S> , one can easily derive the scalar potential and kinetic energy term as @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 is today s critical density of the universe . if we establish the correspondence between the holographic dark energy with @xmath44 and quintessence scalar field , then @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath55 are given by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ez ] ) , ( [ deq ] ) and ( [ w ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the derivative of the scalar field @xmath47 with respect to the redshift @xmath32 can be given @xmath87 where the sign is actually arbitrary since it can be changed by a redefinition of the field , @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we can easily obtain the evolutionary form of the field @xmath89 by fixing the field amplitude at the present epoch ( @xmath90 ) to be zero , @xmath91 .     </S>",
    "<S> phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the shaded regions are occupied by thawing and freezing models respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows denote the evolutionary directions . </S>",
    "<S> the leftmost point of the trajectories corresponds to the present ; the rightmost point is at @xmath92 . as the same in previous figures , the present fractional matter density is taken as @xmath79 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the reconstructed quintessence potential @xmath48 is plotted in figure [ fig : vphi ] , where @xmath93 is also reconstructed according to eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phiprime ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) , also displayed in figure [ fig : phiz ] . </S>",
    "<S> selected curves are plotted for the cases of @xmath43 , 1.1 , 1.2 and 1.3 , and the present fractional matter density is chosen to be @xmath79 . from figures [ fig : vphi ] and [ fig : phiz ] , we can see the dynamics of the scalar field explicitly . obviously , the scalar field @xmath47 rolls down the potential with the kinetic energy @xmath94 gradually decreasing . the equation of state of the quintessence @xmath55 , accordingly , decreases gradually with the cosmic evolution , and as a result @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> as suggested in @xcite , quintessence models can be divided into two classes , `` thawing '' models and `` freezing '' models . </S>",
    "<S> thawing models depict those scalar fields that evolve from @xmath96 but grow less negative with time as @xmath97 ; freezing models , whereas , describe those fields evolve from @xmath98 , @xmath99 to @xmath100 , @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , the holographic quintessence should be ascribed to the freezing model . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : phase ] illustrates the freezing behavior of the holographic quintessence . </S>",
    "<S> note that it has been indicated in @xcite that a practical limit of applicability for thawing and freezing bounds should be @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> since here we only want to show the freezing behavior of holographic quintessence in the @xmath103 phase space , the applicability of these regions are continued to @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> as we have seen , the dynamics of the holographic quintessence can be explored explicitly by the reconstruction .    </S>",
    "<S> the scalar - field models of dark energy can be viewed as low - energy effective description of the underlying theory ( e.g. quantum gravity theory ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quintessence discussed in this paper is specified to an ordinary scalar field minimally coupled to gravity , namely the canonical scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the resulting model with the reconstructed potential is the unique canonical single - scalar model that can reproduce the holographic evolution with @xmath1 of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the aforementioned discussion can be easily generalized to other non - canonical scalar fields , such as @xmath7-essence and tachyon . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it should be noted that the holographic evolution with @xmath41 can also be reproduced by a non - canonical scalar - field ( generalized ghost condensate ) , see @xcite for details .    in conclusion , we suggest in this paper a correspondence between the holographic dark energy scenario and the quintessence scalar - field model . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the viewpoint of that the scalar field models of dark energy are effective theories of an underlying theory of dark energy . the underlying theory , though has not been achieved presently , </S>",
    "<S> is presumed to possess some features of a quantum gravity theory , which can be explored speculatively by taking into account the holographic principle of quantum gravity theory . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the vacuum energy acquires the dynamical property when imposing the holographic principle . though the currently available observational data imply that the holographic dark energy more likely resembles a quintom , i.e. @xmath46 crosses @xmath8 , the data analysis does not rule out the possibility of @xmath98 yet </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the model of @xmath98 can avoid some troubles the model of @xmath5 crossing encounters . </S>",
    "<S> if we regard the scalar - field model ( such as quintessence ) as an effective description of such a theory ( holographic vacuum energy ) , we should be capable of using the scalar - field model to mimic the evolving behavior of the dynamical vacuum energy and reconstructing this scalar - field model according to the evolutionary behavior of holographic dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the holographic dark energy with @xmath44 can be described totally by the quintessence in a certain way . a correspondence between the holographic dark </S>",
    "<S> energy and quintessence has been established , and the potential of the holographic quintessence and the dynamics of the field have been reconstructed . </S>"
