    "most theories of the high @xmath7 oxides start with a cuo@xmath0 plane which is the common building block found in all the copper oxide superconductors .",
    "such a system is tetragonal and is sometimes described by simple two dimensional tight binding bands with first and second nearest neighbour hopping .",
    "the mechanism involved in the superconductivity is still unknown but there is now strong evidence , if not yet a consensus , that the gap has d - symmetry.@xcite of course there are other elements to the structure of the typical copper oxide superconductor but a stack of cuo@xmath0 planes weakly coupled through a transverse hopping @xmath8 can be taken as a simplified first model . while in many of the oxides @xmath8 is small  perhaps of the order of 0.1 mev in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cu cu@xmath0o@xmath9,@xcite and of the order of a few mev in lasrcuo@xmath10in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath11 ( ybco ) at optimum doping , it is much larger and of the order of a few tens of mev which is almost of the same order of magnitude as the in - plane hopping integrals and indicates that this material may be fairly three dimensional .",
    "in addition , ybco has chains ( cuo ) as well as planes ( cuo@xmath0 ) . in such circumstances ,",
    "the system can be expected to be significantly orthorhombic with the source of orthorhombicity residing in the chains . in an orthorhombic system ,",
    "the irreducible representation of the point group crystal lattice which contains the @xmath12 part also contains @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( constant ) parts , and these can mix in the gap so that we can not expect a pure @xmath6-wave order parameter .",
    "strong evidence that the chains play a very important role in optimally doped ybco is obtained from infrared and microwave experiments on untwinned single crystals of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "far infrared experiments@xcite can be used to measure the absolute value of the in plane penetration depth at zero temperature in each of the two principle directions denoted by @xmath15 and @xmath5 with the chains oriented along @xmath5 .",
    "the results are @xmath16  and @xmath17  for yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 with @xmath1893.2k . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature dependence@xcite of the normalized penetration depth , @xmath19 , is almost the same in both directions .",
    "these results have been taken as evidence that the chains carry a significant amount of the condensate density and that the gap in the chains is of the same order of magnitude as in the planes , a fact confirmed in current - imaging tunneling spectroscopy ( cits ) experiments.@xcite it would also follow from the observed large orthorhombicity that the order parameter will not be of a pure @xmath12 symmetry as previously stated and repeated here .",
    "it should contain a significant @xmath20-admixture due to the existence of the chains which are coupled to the planes and participate importantly in the superconductivity .",
    "a first model , which can be used to get some insight into the situation for optimally doped ybco , is that of planes and chains coupled through a transverse tunnelling matrix element @xmath8 with the pairing interaction assumed to reside exclusively in the co@xmath0 plane .",
    "the simplest electronic dispersion relations for such a model @xcite are : @xmath21 - \\mu_1\\\\ \\xi_2 & = & -2t_2\\cos(k_y ) - \\mu_2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the first neighbour hopping in the cuo@xmath0 plane and @xmath23 in the cuo chains with @xmath24 the chemical potential .",
    "application of an interplane matrix element @xmath8 will mix the plane and chain band with resulting band energies having the form : @xmath25 with @xmath26 in these relationships @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are components of momentum ranging from @xmath30 in units of the inverse of the lattice parameters .",
    "results are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "as seen , the effect of the plane - chain coupling is largest where @xmath31 at which point there is an avoided crossing . in fig .  2",
    ", we show how the fermi surfaces are pushed apart in @xmath32-space and see that the amount of distortion of the fermi surfaces depends on their proximity to the avoided crossing in the 2-d brillouin zone .",
    "the various contours are for different values of @xmath29 with @xmath33 corresponding to no coupling ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath29 = 0 corresponding to the largest effect .",
    "the area between these two outer contours corresponds to the fermi surface dispersion in the z - direction .",
    "if it was a perfectly flat cylinder  like structure in this direction , it would project into a single curve in the 2-d brillouin zone .",
    "one result of the large critical temperature in the oxides is that they have an extremely small coherence length @xmath35 .",
    "the coherence length is the distance scale over which the superconducting order parameter @xmath36 may vary spatially . in the bcs theory",
    "it is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electron fermi velocity , and @xmath36 is the magnitude of the bcs order parameter . for a bcs superconductor with @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the fermi velocity can be estimated from the bandwidth of the conduction band , and since the high @xmath7 materials are highly anisotropic , there will be substantial differences between @xmath38 in the various directions",
    ". the coherence length will therefore be anisotropic as well . in the @xmath15 and @xmath5 directions ( parallel to the cuo@xmath0 planes )",
    "the cuo@xmath0 bandwidth is @xmath41 .",
    "the fermi velocity can be estimated as : @xmath42 where @xmath15 is the lattice constant in the @xmath15-direction .",
    "for the bscco compounds , @xmath43 .",
    "the coherence length in the planes is therefore : @xmath44 the bandwidth along the @xmath45 axis is considerably smaller than in the cuo@xmath0 planes . in the bscco compounds , it is typically @xmath46 . since the unit cell size along",
    "the @xmath45-axis is @xmath47 , the coherence length in bscco is @xmath48 these values are typical for most of the high @xmath7 materials and distinguish them from the conventional materials in one important way : the fact that @xmath49 is substantially less than the length of the unit cell along the @xmath45 axis allows the order parameter to vary spatially _ over the unit cell_. in the conventional materials , where the coherence lengths are @xmath50 or @xmath51 , the structure of the unit cell is invisible to the gap . in the high @xmath7 materials , the value of the gap may depend on the layer type : chain or plane .",
    "next we wish to include the superconductivity .",
    "we will assume that the pairing is operative only in the cuo@xmath0 plane and that the chains become superconducting only through the tunnelling matrix element @xmath8 .",
    "in mean field theory , the hamiltonian , @xmath52 , is : @xmath53 with : @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 are the creation operators for electrons in layer @xmath56 and spin @xmath57 .",

    ". we will assume @xmath64 to be separable and have @xmath6-wave symmetry .",
    "that is : @xmath66 with : @xmath67    diagonalisation of the hamiltonian ( 5 ) leads to four energy bands @xmath68 with : @xmath69 ^ 2    - ( t^2 - \\xi_1 \\xi_2)^2 - ( \\xi_2 \\delta_{\\bf k})^2 } .\\ ] ]    in fig .  3",
    ", we show the energy bands for @xmath70 ( dashed curves ) and @xmath71 mev ( solid curves ) . for the uncoupled situation shown for comparison ( dashed curve ) , the chain band exhibits no gap while the plane band shows the usual bcs gap at its fermi surface .",
    "note that the curves are for @xmath72 as a function of @xmath28 and that the @xmath12 gap of the form ( 10 ) is nonzero along that line in the two dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "when @xmath73 , the bands mix as they would in the normal state with a band crossing .",
    "in addition , a gap is induced in the @xmath74 branch corresponding to induced superconductivity in the chains coming from the proximity matrix element @xmath8 .",
    "this gap is small compared with the value of the original gap in the cuo@xmath0 plane which is seen at somewhat higher momentum in this figure .",
    "a first question that needs to be answered is how is @xmath7 changed when @xmath8 is switched on .",
    "this is shown in fig .  4 where we have plotted the value of @xmath7 as a function of @xmath8 for a case when the critical temperature @xmath18100 k in the limit @xmath70 .",
    "we see that as @xmath8 ( in mev ) increases , @xmath7 is reduced by the proximity of the chains but remains substantial even for a value of @xmath71 mev .    in fig .  5",
    ", we show the chain - plane fermi surfaces ( solid curves ) as contours in the first brillouin zone for @xmath75 and @xmath76 mev . the value of @xmath77 ( dashed line ) is also plotted along the fermi curves . it is seen that in the region of the chain fermi surface which is not close to the plane fermi surface , i.e. the region around @xmath78 in the figure , the induced gap is small .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that in this region : @xmath79 ^ 2 \\gg t_\\perp({{\\bf k}})^2,\\ ] ] and that : @xmath80 for the parameters used in the calculations .",
    "this small gap is an important generic feature of a pure proximity model with a plane - chain fermi surface ( 2 sheets ) .    in a coupled two band model , the expression for the electromagnetic response tensor",

    "is evaluated in the normal state and is related to the value of the zero temperature penetration depth .",
    "results for @xmath95 and @xmath96 coming from the chains and planes in our model are shown in fig .",
    "6 . in our notation , the chains are along the b - direction . for the",
    "current along a - direction , the penetration depth ( solid curves ) shows linear dependence at low temperature as expected for d - wave .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the exponentially activated behaviour found for the s - wave case . for the currents in the b - direction ( dashed curve ) ,",
    "the chains contribute significantly to the superfluid density and the shape of the curve is very different .",
    "it shows a strong upward bending at low t which reflects the low energy scale noted in formula ( [ 13 ] ) for the value of the gap which comes from regions of the chain fermi surface well away from the band crossing point .",
    "this feature is generic to proximity models with pairing confined to the cuo@xmath0 plane .",
    "the data of bonn and hardy@xcite in pure single untwinned crystals of ybco are shown in fig .",
    "7 where they are compared with our results .",
    "it is clear that no low energy scale is observed in the data along the b - direction .",
    "in fact , on normalized plots , the observed temperature variation is very similar between a- and b - directions with the slope in the b - direction slightly steeper .",
    "this indicates clearly that the gap in the chain is large and that no small energy scale exists . to understand better how the low temperature slope is related to the d - wave gap",
    ", we show , in fig .  8 , results for the penetration depth in a one band model with gap @xmath97 $ ] for several values of the ratio @xmath98 . in obtaining these results ,",
    "a bcs temperature variation was taken for the temperature dependence of the gap .",
    "it is clear that small gap values give a curve with concave upward curvature while for large values the curve is concave downward . for bcs @xmath99 and",
    "the curve is nearly a straight line with @xmath100 slope .",
    "if for the same zero temperature gap value the critical temperature is decreased , the curve will clearly have a smaller slope .",
    "this is because in that case the system at low temperature is expecting that it should have a straight line behaviour with an intercept at much higher temperature .",
    "an analytic result that can be proved for a simple d - wave model with circular fermi surface in the 2-dimensional brillouin zone and gap variation of the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 is an angle along the fermi surface is that @xmath103,\\ ] ] for @xmath104 .",
    "this shows that the slope as a function of reduced temperature is inversely proportional to the ratio @xmath105 . as this ratio increases",

    "we have plotted the magnetic penetration depth calculated with the lowest three harmonics ( [ basis.eq ] ) of the solutions of the bcs equations ( [ bcs.eq ] ) for the two choices of interaction parameters .",
    "the solid curve is for the @xmath108-direction ( along the chains ) and the dashed curve is for the @xmath109-direction ( perpendicular to the chains ) .",
    "the dotted curve is @xmath110 and is plotted for comparison .",
    "the ratio @xmath111 at zero temperature is 1.37 for both interaction parameter choices since the zero temperature penetration depth is a normal state property .",
    "the zero temperature penetration depth is largely governed by the bandwidth ( ie , @xmath112 )  the larger the bandwidth the larger the zero temperature penetration depth .",
    "as pointed out above , the curvature of the penetration depth curve , @xmath113 , is largely governed by the ratio @xmath114 and is a straight line for the @xmath6-wave bcs value of @xmath115 .",
    "the presence of the chain layer and the interlayer interaction increases this ratio in the plane layer but it remains low in the chain layer due to the absence of an interaction in this layer .",
    "it is this lower value that makes @xmath116 ( along the chains ) have upward curvature ( solid curves ) . including pairing in the chains will push the solid curve towards the dashed one and make the initial low temperature slopes fall closer to each other .",
    "in conclusion , the present data on single crystal untwinned ybco at optimum doping suggest that the proximity effect incorporated into a single perpendicular tunnelling parameter @xmath8 can not account for the observation .",
    "if interplane pairing is included the situation is greatly improved provided the off diagonal pairing is increased sufficiently to produce a gap on the chain which is of the same order of magnitude as that in the planes .",
    "similar values of the gaps on the chains and planes can be taken as evidence that optimally doped ybco is fairly three dimensional and that the coherence length in the @xmath117-direction may not be sufficiently short to allow spatial inhomogeneities to exist within a unit cell .",
