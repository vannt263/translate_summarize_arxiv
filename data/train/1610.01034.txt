    "one of the simplest and effective methods to influence the features of josephson junctions ( jj ) is to shunt the device with linear elements as capacitances , inductances , and resistances @xcite .",
    "the jj together with these elements form different resonant circuits , which are the essential constituents of modern superconducting electronics .",
    "when the josephson frequency is comparable with the frequency of the coupled resonant circuit , the josephson oscillations can be tuned to the external circuit frequency , and the synchronization can also be revealed through the iv - characteristic as a step , a hump , or a dip @xcite , or negative differential resistance branch @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , shunted jj have been suggested for the creation of electric current standard and to close the metrology triangle `` voltage - resistance - current '' .",
    "shunting the jj by @xmath0 elements can be also used to synchronize the josephson oscillations in the bscco high temperature superconductors stacks and to increase the power of the coherent electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz region @xcite .",
    "an essential point of interest of the shunting of josephson junction by lcr - cirquit is that it allows the contemporary presence of two frequencies for the same set of parameters , or birhythmicity , which is encountered in some biochemical systems @xcite , nonlinear electronic circuits @xcite , and extended distributed systems @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of birhythmic systems was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this context",
    "the superconducting circuit consisting of josephson junctions ( jjs ) coupled to a cavity @xcite , as in fig .",
    "1 , represents a preeminent example of birhythmic system that is also interesting for different applications .",
    "the coupling among the junctions is supposed to be provided by a resonant cavity @xcite , thus when all the junctions are entrained it is essential to have a large current in the cavity such that the junctions can been locked through the current in the resonator .",
    "the state with a large current coexists with a state at lower power ; the two states are clearly characterized by two different frequencies .",
    "this is the essential feature of birhythmicity , the coexistence of two attractors characterized by two different amplitudes and frequencies ; depending on the initial conditions , the system can produce oscillations at two distinct periods .",
    "since the attractors are locally stable , the system would however stay at a single frequency , the one selected by the choice of the initial state .",
    "thus the system exhibits a hysteretic behavior : the displayed frequency depends upon the initial conditions . in the presence of noise",
    "the system can switch from one attractor to the other under the influence of the random term @xcite .",
    "the existence of resonance features in the iv - characteristics in various systems of jjs with a resonance circuit was reported in a number of experimental and theoretical works ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a peak in the intensity of coherent electromagnetic radiation from a two - dimensional system of jjs based on nb / al / alox / nb was detected in ref.@xcite at the synchronization of oscillations in different jjs , which is caused by the resonance of josephson oscillations with the oscillations in the resonance circuit .",
    "the considered system has a high potential for applications in quantum metrology , as well @xcite .",
    "the effect of external electromagnetic radiation on the shunted system when creates new phenomena when the induced vertical voltage interval ( usually called shapiro step , ss ) appears in correspondence of the resonance circuit branch .",
    "particularly , when the corresponding ss is on the resonance branch , the amplitude dependence of its widths is determined by the effective frequency which varies in a wide interval @xcite .",
    "much attention to the josephson junctions is nowadays due to the appearance of the novel physical phenomena and a variety of modern applications @xcite .",
    "devices based on the josephson junctions are used to register majorana particles , whose bound states are topologically protected and might be used for quantum computation .",
    "shunting of josephson junctions in such devices and external radiation gives an additional degree of freedom to manipulate and control their parameters and characteristics .",
    "shunting of intrinsic josephson junctions in high - temperature superconductors , that are intensively studied today , leads to the synchronization of oscillations of the superconducting currents in this system and increase the power of the tunable coherent electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz frequency region @xcite .",
    "the role of @xmath0s shunts has been recently underlined in coupled systems @xcite , shapiro steps @xcite and coupled stacks @xcite .",
    "the present paper focus on the behavior of the superconducting current component in jj shunted by an @xmath0 element .",
    "it has been found that the superconducting current in the state corresponding to the resonant branch depends on its frequency .",
    "the value of the maximum current is determined by the proximity of the end point of the rc - branch to the critical current . when dissipation is decreased , the maximum shifts towards the larger resonance frequencies and its width broadens .",

    "<S> when the josephson frequency @xmath1 is close to the eigen frequency @xmath2 of the coupled resonance circuit , the iv - characteristic demonstrates an additional @xmath3-branch . we have investigated the features of the @xmath3-branch and of the superconducting current component for different values of the resonance frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that the maximal value of the superconducting current depends on the resonance frequency and that it increases when the end point of the @xmath3-branch approaches the critical current . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the maximal superconducting current on the resonance frequency at different values of the dissipation parameter is peculiar , for the optimized maximum appears to be independent of the system parameters within @xmath4 . </S>"
