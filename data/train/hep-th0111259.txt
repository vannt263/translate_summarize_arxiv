    "it may not be exaggeration to say that dynamics of 2 + 1 gravity is just an interpretation of nielsen -thurston theory of surface homeomorphisms in terms of concepts known in physics [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "apparently , the  reverse task  of enriching mathematics with concepts known from physics had been accomplished by witten [ 5 ] .",
    "his physical intuition had revolutionized  combinatorial methods of algebraic geometry related to intersection theory  on moduli space of curves [ 6 - 8 ] . in his famous paper [ 9 ]",
    "kontsevich had provided needed mathematical justification to witten s work . since in both papers",
    "the initial object of study is 2 dimensional quantum gravity it is only natural to expect that the results of witten and kontsevich can be reobtained from more general 2 + 1 gravity model .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this is indeed possible .",
    "it should be noted that the results of witten and kontsevich ( w - k ) rely heavily on the fact ( proven by kontsevich [ 9 ] ) that the partition function of 2d gravity happens to be @xmath0 function of the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) hierarchy which is just a special case of  more general kadomtsev - petviashvili ( kp ) hierarchy of nonlinear exactly integrable  partial differential equations .",
    "attempts to connect string theory with exactly integrable systems had been made earlier .",
    "good summary of earlier efforts can be found in ref.[10 ] .",
    "recently , kp equations had been discussed in relation to dynamics of 2 + 1 gravity [ 11 ] .",
    "the content of ref.[11 ] apparently has no connections with results of w - k .",
    "this does not exclude the possibility that such connection might exist and requires further study . in the present work we establish such connection ( reduction ) by reobtaining w - k results from formalism developed earlier for 2 + 1 gravity [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "this formalism is based on some properties of riemann surfaces . from algebraic geometry",
    "it is known that every riemann surface @xmath1 can be described in terms of the corresponding  complex algebraic curve @xmath2 [ 12 ] so that one can use interchangeably algebro - geometric and complex analytic language to discuss the same object , the riemann surface .",
    "this , unfortunately , is not an easy task as was noticed by looijenga [ 7 ] .",
    "the existing difference in terminology is especially apparent when one is interested in the issue of compactification of the moduli space of riemann surfaces ( e.g. see eq.(1.1 ) and related discussion )    moduli spaces @xmath3 are connected with teichmller spaces @xmath4 of riemann surfaces of genus @xmath5 in such a way that @xmath6 @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the mapping class group of @xmath1 .",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath9 have been discussed extensively in our earlier published papers on 2 + 1 gravity [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the concept of moduli had been initially proposed by riemann  who stated that isomorphism classes of closed riemann surfaces of genus @xmath5 are parametrized by 3g-3 complex parameters ( or by 6g-6 real parameters ) .",
    "the space of allowed values of these parameters is effectively the moduli space @xmath3 .",
    "more accurately , such moduli space is called _ coarse moduli space_. it is complex analytic space of dimension 3g-3 but * not * a complex manifold .",
    "presence of singularities ( to be discussed below ) prevents this manifold from becoming a complex manifold [ 6,13 ] .",
    "one way of describing both @xmath3 and @xmath4 is through introduction of marking of @xmath1 ( accordingly of @xmath2 ) .",
    "marking of @xmath1 can be made by introducing some @xmath10 boundary components such that each of them is conformally equivalent to a punctured disk [ 14 ] .",
    "accordingly , for algebraic curves we select @xmath10 _ distinguished _ ( smooth ) points on the curve .",
    "smooth means that the points are * not * located at the possible singularities of  @xmath2 . according to deligne and mumford [ 15 ] such singularities are regular double points which , in the case of  traditional visualization of  riemann surfaces as  closed surfaces with @xmath11 holes , are associated with formation of nodes as depicted in fig.1 .",
    "[ ptb ]    figu1.eps    the compactification @xmath12  of moduli space is achieved by inclusion into @xmath13 domains in parameter space associated with riemann surfaces with nodes . in the language of algebraic geometry",
    "complex curves associated with such surfaces are called _",
    "stable_.  marked curves possess only finitely many authomorphisms .",
    "it is known [ 6 ] that no stable curve can have more than 3g-3 nodes .",
    "this fact may be easily understood if we recall that each riemann surface admits pants decomposition [ 2 ] so that 3g-3 nodes can be associated with degenerate geodesics whose lengths are squeezed to zero . for riemann surface @xmath1 instead of ( or in addition to ) marked points one can think about families of closed curves ( lamination sets [ 4 ] ) and their intersections . by  properly defining intersection number(s ) one can measure the nontriviality of such sets [ 6 ] . in algebraic geometry",
    "such numbers are associated with cohomology classes known also as @xmath14 _ classes _ @xmath15 in @xmath16 .",
    "these numbers should  not be confused with _",
    "geometrical _ intersection numbers introduced by thurston [ 16,17 ] . roughly speaking such number",
    "@xmath17 measures the number of intersections between a selected simple nontrivial closed curve @xmath18 on @xmath1 and measured foliation @xmath19 : @xmath20.this observation allows one to introduce equivalence relations between measured foliations .",
    "in particular , foliations @xmath21 and @xmath22 are _ projectively _ equivalent if there is number @xmath23 such that  @xmath17(@xmath21,@xmath24 following thurston [ 17]and others [ 18 ] , we define the space of projective laminations @xmath25(@xmath1 )  as space of equivalence classes of measured foliations .",
    "such defined space forms a _ boundary _ of the teichmller space @xmath26 the compactification of the teichmller space @xmath27(@xmath1 ) is defined now as @xmath28 the set @xmath29 is closed ball of real dimension @xmath30 whose boundary is identified with @xmath25(@xmath1 ) . since the moduli space is the quotient of @xmath31 by the mapping class group @xmath8 , is clear that such defined compactification of the teichmller space leads accordingly to the compactification of the moduli space .",
    "such compactificatioon is apparently different from that of deligne - mumford .",
    "the difference has some physical meaning .",
    "indeed , in the traditional , algebro - geometric case , no dynamics is involved while in the thurston s case the dynamics ( that is  time evolution  ) is associated with dynamically formed 3-manifolds , e.g. see chapters 8 and 9 of thurston s lecture notes [ 16 ] .",
    "these dynamical features are explained in physical terms and illustrated in our recently published paper on statistical mechanics of 2 + 1 gravity [ 4 ] .    since in 2 dimensional quantum gravity",
    "there is no time evolution , naturally , there is no dynamical observables and theory is essentially topological .",
    "witten [ 5 ] had suggested to study the topological averages of the type @xmath32 provided that @xmath33 . to understand the meaning of such an average it is  instructive to consider the first nontrivial example : @xmath34 . in this case",
    "we obtain , @xmath35 witten had demonstrated that @xmath36 .",
    "this result had been actually obtained earlier by wolpert [ 19 ] who noticed that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is familiar weil - petersson khler ( 1,1 ) form which plays very important role in both the theory of teichmller spaces [ 20 ] and in string theory [ 21 ] .",
    "the dot above the equality sign has the following meaning .",
    "the integral @xmath39 had been independently calculated by wolpert [ 22 ] and penner [ 23 ] and is known to be equal to @xmath40 so that the right hand side of eq.(1.4 ) is equal to @xmath41 the same result was obtained by witten [ 5 ] who argues that it should be additionally divided by 2 because  the generic elliptic curve has two symmetries  .",
    "thus , evidently , computation of  tautological averages  , eq.(1.2 ) ,",
    "is effectively equivalent ( up to numerical prefactors ) to calculation of  the weil - petersson volumes of @xmath12 .",
    "zograf [ 24 ] had calculated such volumes for @xmath42 punctured spheres .",
    "based on these results , matone [ 25 ] had developed and solved non pertubatively 2d liouvillian gravity .",
    "some of his results had been used and extended in the work by kaufman , manin and zagier [ 26 ] .",
    "these results had been further streamlined in recently published monograph by manin [ 27 ] .      to make an additional connection with physics",
    ", we would like to reanalyze just obtained results from the point of view of differential geometry of complex manifolds [ 21,28 ] . in this regard ,",
    "a closed _ integral _ ( 1,1 ) form @xmath43  on  a complex manifold @xmath44 determines the equivalence class of a line bundle @xmath45 recall  [ 21 ] that a line bundle @xmath46 on manifold _",

    "this result coincides with eq.(1.7 ) of witten s paper [ 5 ] ( for @xmath68 ) .",
    "the reason of introducing the factor of 1/2 can be explained as follows . according to wells , ref.[28 ] , ch - r 6",
    ", the traditional construction of hodge line bundles for manifolds requires that @xmath69 moreover , if @xmath70 is an integer , it is actually equal to the euler characteristic of the manifold . in our case , @xmath71 is an orbifold and for the orbifolds the euler number can be rational number according to thurston [ 16 ] .",
    "wells explains how to construct the hodge bundle for any khlerian manifold / orbifold . to this purpose , if the constant @xmath70 in eq.(1.11 ) is not an integer , it is sufficient to rescale the form @xmath72 , so that the rescaled form * is * the hodge form .",
    "since the moduli space @xmath12 is an orbifold , eq.(1.10 ) is acceptable and , hence , with such remarks , coincides with eq.(1.7 ) of witten s paper ( for @xmath68 ) , ref.[5 ] .",
    "obtained results possess additional  very important physical information allowing us to make direct  and simple connections with grassmannians and , hence , with exactly integrable systems , using arguments different from that of witten [ 5 ] and kontsevich [ 9 ] .",

    "we argue that the w - k partition function is relevant for the seifert - fibered phase .",
    "this phase was not discussed in refs.[1 - 4 ] .",
    "we should warn our readers that complete description of the sefert - fibered phase requires more than just the w - k model .",

    "the complete description of this phase ( which by the way contains all known crystallographic groups and much more [ 60 ] ) in physical terms remains challenging research problem .",
    "thus , the results of refs.[1,4 ] for the partition function of 2 + 1 gravity should be extended to reach an accord with results of w - k model . to this purpose , following nielsen [ 61 ] , dynamics of the riemann surface homeomorphisms should be lifted to the universal cover , e.g. to the poincare disc model of * * h**@xmath281 . in such model",

    "these numbers had been used earlier in our work , ref.[1 ] for construction of the partition function . in this paper",
    "we use this combinatorial data in order to establish several important bijections:1 ) from the set of arcs to the set of dyck paths , fig.5 ; 2 ) from the set of dyck paths to the set of parallelogram polyominoes , fig.6 ; 3 ) from the set of polyominoes to the set of young tableaux and , finally , 4 ) from the set of young tableaux to the set of vicious walkers , figs.7 and 8 .",

    "our method is based on use of known various equivalent geometrical ways to describe the combinatorics of catalan numbers [ 42 ] .",
    "the edges of thus constructed ribbon graphs are replaced by the paths of vicious walkers so that in the end using combinatorics of the young tableaux the partition function for assembly of vicious walkers acquires the form of the r.h.s . of eq.(1.35 ) .",
    "section 5 is included in this work for several reasons .",
    "first , it discusses the issue of universality of the w - k model from the point of view of dynamical systems theory . by universality",
    "we mean the fact that partition functions of w - k and many related models to be discussed briefly in this section are solutions of the kdv hierarchy .",
    "the reasons for this universality can be traced back to the very basic properties of quasiconformal transformations known already to ahlfors long time ago [ 65 ] .",
    "although in ref .",
    "[ 3 ] these transformations had been discussed extensively , in this paper more up to date information is presented to make it relevant to the results obtained in earlier sections .",
    "this includes some facts about the thompson and the ptolemy groups , about their connections with binary trees ( and , hence , with catalan numbers ) and their relations with the universal teichmller and moduli spaces , etc .",
    "second , it discusses briefly some potential physical and biological applications of the obtained results .",
    "finally , it discusses connections with frobenius manifolds , self - dual einstein equations , etc .",
    ", thus leaving many problems open for further study .",
    "following forrester [ 54 ] and fisher [ 52 ] , we would like now to formulate a lock step model of vicious walkers .",
    "incidentally , this model is just many walks generalization of the directed polymer model considered in our earlier work , ref.[66].the continuum limit of the distribution function for this directed polymer produces  the euclidean version of the dirac propagator for particle whose mass is associated with bending probabilities to be discussed below . in case of many walkers the fermionic nature of the dirac  particles  ( walks ) imposes a sort of pauli principle which forbids two walks to intersect .",
    "this is characteristic to all quantum many body problems where all  particles  live in the same  world time  [ 67 ] . in the theory of",
    "brownian motion each walker is allowed to have its own world time [ 68 ] so that , accordingly , one can have many  world times quantum mechanics .",
    "we shall refrain from discussion of these options referring interested reader to current literature [ 69 ] .",
    "the lock step model assumes just one  world time  .",
    "technically this means the following .",
    "we consider a square lattice where @xmath284 coordinate is assigned for  space  while the @xmath285 coordinate is assigned for  time  .",
    "if @xmath139 walkers are labelled in linear sequence along @xmath284 axis so that one has @xmath286 at  time ",
    "@xmath287 , the same inequalities should hold for all subsequent times .",
    "the walkers start either on the even or on the odd numbered sites on the x axis . at each tick of the clock",
    "each walker moves either to the right or to the left ( along lattice diagonals ) with equal ( bending ) probability @xmath288 .",
    "the probabilities , in general , may not be equal and are associated with masses of the dirac particles as discussed in our work , ref.[66 ] . because of imposed initial condition , no two walkers can occupy the same lattice space at any time .",
    "this circumstance makes walkers  vicious  .",
    "let * * x**@xmath289 be the initial configuration of such vicious walkers and * * x**=(@xmath290 be the final configuration at time @xmath291 . to calculate the total number of walks starting at @xmath287 at * * x**@xmath292 and ending at @xmath291at * x * we need to know the probability distribution @xmath293 that the walkers proceed without passing , i.e. maintaining the inequalities @xmath294 from their initial configuration  at time @xmath287 to their final configuration at time @xmath291 .",
    "it is of interest to study this problem for large times : @xmath295 . in this case",
    "it is possible to make a transition to the continuum limit in our study of the probability distribution . in doing so , we shall follow the arguments of huse and fisher [ 53 ] . to begin , we need to recall that in the continuum limit the probability distribution @xmath296 for @xmath139 * independent * random walkers is known to be @xmath297 the diffusion constant @xmath193 sets up the scale since , as usual , @xmath298(x@xmath299 because of  use of a single world time for all walkers the above distribution function can be also viewed as distribution function for a * single * walker in @xmath139-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the restrictions  given by eq.(2.2 ) impose additional constraints that such a walker must not cross any ( hyper)planes described by the set of equations @xmath300 . in view of the results of section 1 , e.g. see fig.2 and discussion related to it , the assembly of these planes forms grassmann manifold .",
    "this statement can be clarified further by considering the following example .",
    "following gaudin [ 70 ] consider schrdinger equation for one dimensional bose gas  of @xmath139 particles interacting via point - like pairvise interaction potential .",
    "the dimensionless form of the schrdinger equation for such particle system is given by @xmath301 this equation is equivalent to the boundary value problem of obtaining the wave function @xmath302 of the equation @xmath303 where @xmath304 is just @xmath139-dimensional  free  laplacian , and the wave function @xmath302 is subjected to the set of constraints : @xmath305 the condition @xmath302=0 on the hyperplanes is achieved in the limit @xmath70=@xmath306 according to gaudin [ 70 ] .",
    "it can be shown , that for any @xmath70 solution of the corresponding quantum mechanical problem is obtained with help of the bethe ansatz method [ 70 ] . moreover ,",
    "any problem solvable by the bethe ansatz method is essentially of the type just described as had been demonstrated rigorously by gutkin [ 71 ] . therefore , not surprisingly , that there are deep connections between the classical exactly integrable systems of kp type and the quantum mechanical exactly integrable systems solved by the bethe ansatz method [ 72 ] .",
    "the hecke algebra leading to the yang - baxter equations providing mathematical justification of the bethe ansatz method is coming from some particular representation of the symmetric group [ 73 ] and , hence , is connected with schur and related polynomials .",
    "some additional details can be found in ref . [ 74 ] .    the mathematical problem posed by eq.s(2.5 ) and ( 2.6 )",
    "can be equivalently formulated as problem about properties of random walk inside @xmath307dimensional caleidoscope .",
    "that is we are looking for solution of an eigenvalue problem for  free  laplacian compatible with some reflection group[70,71 ] . in the simplest cases these are just subgroups of the symmetric group @xmath308 made out of even and odd permutations . in view of this",
    ", we obtain , @xmath309 where @xmath310 depending upon the symmetry of permutation ( even or odd ) . taking eq.(2.3 ) into account , this result can be rewritten equivalently as @xmath311 where @xmath312   .",

    "since both walks intersect each other only at initial and final points this situation looks almost the same as for two vicious walkers . following labelle [ 83 ] , we can make it identical to that for the vicious walkers . to achieve this goal , it is sufficient to translate the upper part by the vector ( 1,1 ) while the lower part by the vector ( 1,-1 ) so that one obtains either a problem about statistics of one vicious walker in the presence of the absorbing wall or about statistics of two vicious walkers .",
    "both problems are discussed in fisher s paper [ 52 ] and are actually equivalent .",

    "we have the shape ( 4,4,4,2,2,1)/(3,2 ) .",
    "that is from standard looking young table of shape ( 4,4,4,2,2,1 ) a piece in the upper left corner is truncated which is also standard table of shape ( 3,2 ) .",
    "hence , the skew young diagrams differ very inessentially from standard looking young diagrams . using this circumstance , we need to exhibit yet another bijection .",

    "the interest in these equations stems from the fact that in the large @xmath10 limit , eq.(3.10 ) acquires familiar in physics literature path integral form .",
    "this fact may lead to some new physical applications .",
    "already many physical applications of vicious walker models can be found in papers by fisher [ 52 ] and  by huse and fisher [ 53 ] .    in the present case , using results of tracy and widom ( eq.(4.6 ) of ref.[56 ] ) eq.(2.18 ) of section 2 can be rewritten as follows @xmath477 with airy function defined in eq.(2.19 ) . using okounkov s lemma 2.6 , ref .

    "this makes the above  path integral  reminiscent to that for the ring polymer near hard nonpenetrable wall in the presence of some stretching force [ 67 ] .    to make connections with results of kontsevich [ 9 ] we need to rewrite the partition function @xmath481 $ ] as genus expansion : @xmath472=\\sum\\limits_{g=0}^{\\infty}z_{g}(\\mathbf{x } ) \\tag{3.14}%\\ ] ] where , in view of eq.(1.2 ) , @xmath482 the question arises immediately about connections of eq.s ( 3.14 ) and ( 3.15 ) with eq.s ( 3.8)-(3.10 ) .",
    "this issue is addressed and treated in refs.[77,87 ] and , therefore , there is no need to repeat the arguments presented in these references here . instead , to reach essentially the same goals we would like to use different arguments in this work .    in section 1.1",

    "wirtinger - like formula is used in kontsevich paper as well ( e.g.see section 3 of ref.[9]).hence , the partition function of two - dimensional topological gravity is effectively the generating function for the weil - petersson volumes . in the fixed genus case such volume according to kontsevich",
    "is given by @xmath484 with @xmath485(@xmath486 being the first chern class of the @xmath487th line bundle , @xmath488 and @xmath489 .",
    "the above expression  becomes a true volume when in the set @xmath490 of indeterminates @xmath491(@xmath492 ( arbitrary sequence of positive numbers ) each @xmath205 is being put equal to one .",
    "this is not necessary , however , since the quantity of interest is the product given by eq.(1.2 ) which is obtainable anyway with @xmath493s @xmath494being different from one@xmath495 hence , the indeterminates actually play a role of an auxiliary variables analogous to @xmath496 in eq.(3.15 ) .",
    "the connection with schur polynomials and , hence , with tau function is clear if one combines eq.(1.28 ) and porteous formula , eq.(1.27 ) with eq.(3.16a ) .",
    "finally , arguments  presented in section 2 , especially , eq.(2.36 ) , provide needed justification of eq.(3.15 ) since the result , eq.(3.16 ) , of kontsevich can be equivalently rewritten as @xmath497 to make connection with the matrix models additional steps are required .",
    "for instance , kontsevich is making a laplace transform of eq.(3.16b ) in order to obtain @xmath498 with @xmath499 being the laplace variable conjugate to @xmath205 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath500 the overall factor of @xmath501 drops out from the main kontsevich identity , eq.(1.35 ) . in view of the results of refs.[77,86,87 ] and that going to be presented in section 4 , in order to reach an accord with the result of kontsevich , eq.(3.17 ) , it is also necessary to perform the laplace transform on @xmath502 in eq.(3.15 ) provided that this expression is properly rescaled .",
    "the laplace transform is obtained then as follows : @xmath503 application of the formula @xmath504 to eq.(3.18 ) produces the expected result : @xmath505 where , in order to achieve an agreement with kontsevich , one needs to make identification : @xmath506 in eq.(1.35 ) .",
    "clearly , such identification is ultimately connected with rescaling made in eq.(3.18).the justification of this rescaling is explained in the next section .",
    "this is also needed for completion of the proof of kontsevich identity , eq.(1.35 ) of section 1 .",
    "ribbon graphs had been invented by penner [ 62 ] ( similar construction can be found also in papers by harer [ 88 ] ) for description of the moduli space @xmath13 of riemann surfaces . in physics literature",
    "similar construction had been independently developed by saadi and zwiebach [ 63 ] and later developed in numerous papers by zwiebach , e.g. see ref . [ 89 ] cited in kontsevich work , ref.[9 ] .",
    "both zwiebach and kontsevich use the jenkins - strebel quadratic differentials ( e.g. see section 3 of  our earlier work , ref.[2 ] , for condensed summary of their properties ) for construction of the ribbon graphs . in this section",
    "we would like to develop alternative method of construction of ribbon graphs which does not require explicit use of quadratic differentials .",
    "we would like to explain the rationale for constructing the ribbon graphs in connection with results obtained thus far in this paper .",
    "first , the ribbon graphs appear naturally in matrix models for strings [ 90 ] and qcd [ 91 ] . hence , they are physically interesting and easily constructible using feynman - like rules known in quantum field theory [ 92 ] .",
    "second , mathematically these graphs are interesting for several reasons : a ) they are associated with problem of imbedding of , say , trivalent graphs into riemann  surface of fixed genus [ 93 ] and , since graphs are related to combinatorial group theory [ 94 ] , this problem is also of group - theoretic interest ; b ) these graphs are also related to train tracks discussed in our work , ref.[2 ] .",
    "because of this connection with train tracks , the number of potential practical applications is expected to be well beyond particle physics as explained in the discussion section of ref.[2 ] .",
    "third , and most important for the purposes of this work , they are needed for establishing one - to one correspondence between the topological gravity and the random matrix models of string theory .",
    "the aspects of this correspondence are discussed in detail in ref.[90 ] .",
    "mathematically , this correspondence is reflected in the kontsevich identity , eq.(1.35 ) .",
    "hence , following kontsevich [ 9 ] it is necessary to prove that the r.h.s.of eq.(1.35 ) is equal to the l.h.s . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we had demonstrated that the l.h.s of the identity , eq.(1.35 ) , is associated with the enumeration of  allowed configurations for an assembly of vicious walkers .",
    "this problem has been mapped into enumeration of the young tableau , e.g. see figs 7 and 8 .",
    "these pictures provide a geometrical way of describing partitions of  nonnegative integers .",
    "hence , for ribbon graphs we have to find analogous partitions . evidently , the kontsevich identity , eq.(1.35 ) , is just the statement about existence of different but equivalent ways of  describing partitions as had been stated in the introduction .    to describe partitions associated with ribbon graphs we need to construct such graphs first",
    "to facilitate reader s understanding , we employ some results on graphs and ribbon graphs from the pedagogically written paper by mulase and penkava [ 64].ultimately , our way of constructing the ribbon graphs is different from that discussed in this reference since we are not using quadratic differentials .    * definition 4.1 . * a graph @xmath8=(@xmath277 , @xmath279 ; i ) consists of a finite set of vertices @xmath277=(@xmath507 and finite set of edges @xmath279 together with a map i from @xmath279 to the set ( @xmath508)/s@xmath509 of unordered pairs of vertices called incidence relation .",

    "the degree ( valence ) of a vertex @xmath512 is the number @xmath513 which is the number of edges incident to the vertex .    * definition 4.2 . * a graph isomorphism is a pair ( @xmath514 of bijective maps @xmath515and @xmath516 that preserve the incidence relation .    to construct a ribbon graph",
    "the above definitions should be modified .",
    "the modification consists in labeling of middle points of each edge thus effectively creating extra degree 2 vertices associated with each edge .",
    "we denote this extra vertex set as  @xmath517 now the new set of vertices is the disjoint union @xmath518 while the new set of edges is the disjoint union @xmath519 since the midpoint of each edge now divides it into two parts .",
    "the incidence relation is described now by the map @xmath520 because each edge of @xmath521 is connecting one vertex of @xmath277 to one vertex of @xmath522 .obviously , an edge of @xmath521 is called a _ half edge _ of @xmath523 for every vertex _ _",

    "[ ptb ]    figu9.eps    such definition of the ribbon graph leads to the following construction of such graph out of ordered vertices .",
    "the strips corresponding to the two half edges are connected following the orientation of their boundaries to form ribbons .",
    "the final surface is no longer planar in general .",
    "it is an oriented surface whose boundaries are made of boundaries of the ribbons . to illustrate this construction ,",
    "let us consider the simplest case first . to this purpose , we recall that for the case of punctured torus and trice punctured sphere we have 3 geodesics ( on the schottky doubled surface ) which we lift to the poincare disc .",
    "we associate with these geodesics a trivalent graph as depicted in fig.10 .",

    "this can be done in two ways .",

    "if the edge e of @xmath8 is incident to two distinct vertices v@xmath528 and v@xmath509 another ribbon graph @xmath529 called _ contraction _ of @xmath8 is obtained from @xmath8 by removing the edge e and joining the vertices v@xmath528 and v@xmath509 to a single vertex with the cyclic ordering at the joint vertex determined by the cyclic order of the edges incident to v@xmath528starting with the edge following e up to the edge preceding e , followed by the edges incident to v@xmath530starting with the edge following e and ending with the edge preceding e.    evidently , the contraction procedure decreases the number of edges and vertices by one .",
    "every ribbon graph can be obtained from the trivalent ribbon graph by applying a sequence of contractions .",
    "* definition 4.5*. the expansion of the ribbon graph is operation  _ inverse _ to the contraction .",
    "this means that every trivalent ribbon graph can be constructed by the expansion procedure starting from a very simple analogue of fig.10 . in view of the euler equation @xmath531 such procedure",
    "will produce the desired kontsevich - type trivalent ribbon graph .",
    "let us consider this construction in some detail .",
    "for example some representative contraction and expansion of an edge  is depicted in fig.13 .",
    "[ ptb ]    figu13.eps    * remark 4.6*. the reader familiar with our earlier work , ref.[1 ] , can easily recognize the whitehead moves characteristic for train tracks .",
    "this fact alone is sufficient for making connection between ribbon graphs and quadratic differentials . since in the present case",
    "no topology changing moves are involved , this justifies our earlier statement that the results of w - k can be recovered from the seifert - fibered ( periodic ) phase of 2 + 1 gravity .    for any vertex of degree @xmath532",
    "there are @xmath533 ways of expanding it by adding an edge .",

    "[ ptb ]    figu14.eps    the series of contractions / expansions is ultimately related to the number of ways a convex polygon with @xmath112 sides can be triangulated by nonintersecting diagonals .",
    "this number is catalan number again [ 42 ] .",
    "although one may probably use this observation to develop bijections analogous to those discussed in section 3 , we leave such an opportunity outside the scope of this work in view of another options to be discussed below .    to finish our construction of the ribbon graphs we have to keep in mind few additional facts . first , by looking at fig.10 and realizing that two copies of the disc model of * * h**@xmath281 are needed for construction of the ribbon graph , it is clear that the process of expansion and gluing of strips to each other should be allowed to be different in each disc",
    "hence , we have to associate the probability of 1/2 to every vertex on each disc .",
    "this means that we have to have an overall ( assembly ) factor of 2@xmath534  for a particular realization of the ribbon graph .",
    "second , the rest of the automorphisms of the ribbon graph are , evidently , the same as for the  normal  graph .",
    "this concludes our description of the ribbon graph construction .      in section 3 the laplace transform , eq.(3.20 ) , of the partition function for an assembly of vicious walkers has been obtained .",
    "now it is time to explain how these vicious walkers reemerge with help of the ribbon graphs . to this purpose",
    "let us notice that the boundary components of these graphs can be looked upon as made of polygons as kontsevich had noted in section 2.2 . of ref.[9 ] .",
    "hence , each ribbon graph is can be classified by certain  non negative integer number of triangles ( n@xmath535 , quadrangles ( n@xmath536 , pentagons ( n@xmath537 , hexagons ( n@xmath538 , etc . each edge @xmath539(@xmath278 of the ribbon graph",

    "then , given ribbon graph can be viewed as particular realization of the partition of _",
    "l _ into numbers associated with lengths of these polygons .",
    "alternatively , one can assign the total number of polygons ( that is the total number of faces n in eq.(4.5 ) ) and consider partition of this number into n@xmath542 , n@xmath543 , n@xmath544 etc . in any case",
    ", this means that the young tableaux can be associated with such partition and , in view of the results of section 3 , again , the vicious walkers can be linked with such young / ferrers tables .",
    "the question remains : how to connect the vicious walkers with ribbon polygons explicitly ?",
    "to this purpose recall remark 2.1 . and discussion which follows .",
    "according to this remark and the following discussion both correlation functions @xmath351 and @xmath355 are defined in fact for vicious walks made out of loops .",
    "topologically , our polygons are also loops .",
    "hence , it makes sense to identify the loops entering into expressions for @xmath351 and @xmath355 with those coming from polygons associated with ribbon graphs .",
    "this identification requires some care ( that is it requires some proofs ) and , hence , can not be made straightforwardly as we would like to demonstrate now .    if we associate ( replace ) the polygonal paths by the paths of vicious walkers then , except at vertices , only  binary interactions  between these walkers need to be considered .",
    "these  binary interactions  are of geometrical origin since they are effectively equivalent to considering just one vicious walker in the presence of an absorbing wall [ 52 ] . according to fisher [ 52 ] , this means that  no walk can penetrate the wall and any walk attempting to do so is eliminated  .",
    "in addition to the geometrical constraint on such walk , the present case differs from that discussed by fisher because one has to demonstrate that the walk which survived encounter with one wall entirely forgets about this encounter when it is facing the next wall .",
    "fortunately , this is the case .",
    "indeed , the non normalized distribution function @xmath545 for the walk starting at @xmath546 and after @xmath10 steps reaching the point @xmath284 is obtained by fisher , e.g. see eq.(5.5 ) of ref.[52 ] , and is given by @xmath547 where , apart from the factor @xmath548one can easily recognize the probability of the first passage through @xmath284 at  time ",
    "n for the random walk which had started at the origin : @xmath549 [ 75].this probability has yet another interpretation more suitable for the problem we are discussing . indeed , following feller , ref.[75],chr3 ,",
    "the same expression describes probability for two dimensional ( * directed * ) random walkers which had begun their walk at the origin and after @xmath10 steps had ended at some point @xmath550  of @xmath551- plane , provided that these walkers never cross the @xmath552 axis .",
    "evidently , one may associate @xmath552axis with  time  ( in our case n ) direction while @xmath285 -axis with  space  direction in order to get vicious walk interpretation of such random walk . in any event",
    ", it should be clear that in space direction ( that is perpendicular to the wall ) such walk is acting as random and , hence , it  forgets  its past .",
    "this observation provides justification for representation of the  circular  vicious walk by a  sequence of * independent * random vicious walkers- * one * for * each * edge of the closed polygon .",
    "next , we have to find an analogue of the partition function , eq.(3.8).this is accomplished in several steps .",
    "first , we notice that eq.(3.8 ) does not contain information about the number of steps in the walk , only about the number of walks . using eq.s ( 3.8 ) and ( 4.6 )",
    "we introduce * for each edge * the following generating function ( known as perimeter measure [ 86,87 ] ) @xmath553 where @xmath554 and we put @xmath555 in @xmath556 in eq.(4.6 ) .",
    "this is permissible since the factor @xmath557 can be always amended to absorb @xmath558 ( e.g. read fisher s paper , ref .",
    "using eqs ( 4.6)-(4.8 ) the explicit form of the perimeter measure can be easily obtained using standard tables of the laplace transform .",
    "the final result is given by @xmath559 this result should be applied to all edges of the ribbon graph and the final result should take into account all automorphisms @xmath560 of the underlying  normal  trivalent graphs . taking into account the assembly factor of 2@xmath534",
    "the final result can be written as follows @xmath561 with indices @xmath17 and @xmath562 referring to @xmath17-th and @xmath563th polygons sharing the same edge .    since the l.h.s .",
    "is given by eq.(3.20 ) , eq.(4.10 ) coincides with kontsevich identity , eq.(1.35 ) , provided that identification @xmath564 is made .",
    "since for trivalent graphs @xmath565 , we obtain @xmath566 in accord with ref.[87 ] .",
    "in this section we would like to provide another interpretation to the results obtained in previous sections .",
    "this interpretation is desirable since its aim is to explain to what extent w - k model is universal from the point of view of dynamical systems theory .",
    "this is also desirable for the purpose of  connecting results of this paper with wdvv  equations and frobenius manifolds [ 27,95 ] .  to begin , we need to introduce some information about the thompson groups .",
    "the groups @xmath58 , @xmath567 and @xmath190 were introduced by richard thompson in 1965 .",
    "unfortunately , his results had not been published .",
    "this , nevertheless , had not stopped line of research initiated by thompson as can be seen from the pedagogically written review article by cannon , floyd and parry [ 96 ] .",
    "below , we provide some basic facts on thompson groups using mainly this reference .",
    "additional sources will be used whenever they are needed to suit our needs .",
    "let @xmath58 be the set of piecewise linear homeomorphisms from the closed unit interval [ 0,1 ] to itself that are differentiable except at finitely many points .",
    "let @xmath568 and let @xmath569 be the set of points at which @xmath79 is not differentiable .",
    "this partition determines intervals [ @xmath570 $ ] for @xmath488 which are called intervals of the partition .",
    "a partition of [ 0,1 ] is called _ standard dyadic _ partition if and only if the intervals of partition are standard dyadic intervals .            for @xmath573",
    "the function @xmath79 can be written as follows @xmath574 with @xmath575 being a power of 2 and @xmath576 being a dyadic rational number .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath577 and @xmath79 maps the set of dyadic rational numbers bijectively to itself .",
    "hence , @xmath58 is closed under the composition of functions and therefore is a subgroup of the group of all homeomorphisms from [ 0,1 ] to [ 0,1 ] .",
    "this group is @xmath58 group of thompson .    *",
    "definition * * 5.2*. when points 0 and 1 are identified to make a circle @xmath578 , then , the resulting thompson group is called @xmath567 group . another thompson group acting on the circle",
    "is @xmath190 group .",
    "its definition is a bit technical [ 96 ] but , at  physical level  of rigor , the difference between @xmath190 and @xmath567 groups is hardly noticeable . therefore , following ref.[97 ] we shall denote both @xmath190 and @xmath567 groups as pl@xmath579 and we shall keep in mind that both groups are subgroups of the group @xmath580 of piecewise orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the circle . the following proposition proven in ref.[96 ] is very important .",

    "the standard dyadic tessellation of the poincare disc depicted in fig.16 can be shown [ 97,98 ] to be in one to one correspondence with the farey tessellation of the unit disc * d * discussed in detail in ref.[4 ] .",
    "such tessellation can be obtained from two  seeds ",
    ", that is from two triangles with vertices located at 0=1/0 , 1=1/1 , @xmath587 and 0,-1 and @xmath306 respectively ( e.g. see fig.16 and section 2 of ref.[4 ] ) the duals to the tessellations originating from these seeds are rooted binary trees whose roots are connected to each other as depicted in fig.9 of ref.[4 ] .",
    "the farey tessellation is also known as _ ideal triangulation _ of * d * [ 98 ] .",
    "ideal since the triangle which cover the hyperbolic plane / disc are ideal in the same sense as euclidean equilateral triangles covering the entire plane without gaps form an ideal triangulation of the euclidean plane .",
    "since the farey tessellation is multileveled ( e.g. fig.16 depicts just two levels while section 2 of ref.[4 ] describes how to construct tessellations of any level ) . if the level is finite(or at least periodic as depicted in fig.8 of ref.[4 ] ) , then the duals of these tessellations are two rooted binary trees that are also finite . with help of ref.[42 ] they can be put in bijective correspondence with * two * systems of arcs , e.g. those depicted in figs.3 , and 10 , etc . needed for construction of the finite ribbon graph as discussed in section 4 .",
    "surely , the infinite level case of farey tessellation is obtained as limiting case of  finite level case .",
    "the moves depicted in fig.s 17 and 18 are in fact homeomorphisms of the circle [ 98,100 ] belonging to the subgroup @xmath580 .",
    "they affect the pattern of triangulation of the unit disc and , hence , affect the binary trees . as demonstrated in ref.[96 ] , the group of automorphisms of the reduced binary trees ( meaning of the word _ reduced _ is explained in section 2 of ref.[96 ] . )",
    "coincides with thompson group pl@xmath586 in the same reference the analogue of moves @xmath18 and @xmath452 for trees is obtained .",
    "some additional physics can be associated now with these mathematical facts . to this purpose , following ref.[101 ] we notice that the automorphisms of two binary trees associated with two arc systems are independent .",
    "each of these trees is in bijective correspondence with some triangulation of the convex polygon by non crossing diagonals [ 42 ] .",
    "every automorphism of individual tree causes some change in the triangulation pattern for given polygon .",
    "since these changes are independent , following sleator , trajan and thurston [ 102 ] one may ask about the minimal number of automorphic steps needed to bring one triangulation pattern in exact correspondence with another .",
    "this problem is of major importance in computer science . to make it also of importance to physics ( and also to evolutionary genetics [ 103 ] , dynamics and thermodynamics of folding of rna [ 82,104 ] , etc . )",
    "following ref.[102 ] several more steps are required .",
    "first , by gluing these two polygons to each other we form a triangulated sphere @xmath588 .",
    "second , we project this sphere stereographically into the complex plane so that pattern of triangulations on @xmath588 is transferred to the euclidean plane .",
    "next , we associate this plane with boundary of the upper half space model for * * h**@xmath589the triangular pattern on such plane is sufficient for reconstruction of the hyperbolic polyhedra according to thurston [ 16 ] .",
    "a pedagogical account of how it can be actually done can be found in ref.[105 ] . finally ,",
    "if needed , such polyhedra can be mapped into the hyperbolic ball model of * * h**@xmath590 so that the vertices of these hyperbolic polyhedra are located at the sphere at infinity @xmath591 each triangulation pattern on the sphere @xmath592 thus associated with some hyperbolic polyhedron of finite volume @xmath593 which is determined by this triangulation pattern . the physics can be now injected into this picture by introducing some boltzmann factor exp(-@xmath594 so that different volumes are related to different triangulations .",
    "the larger the volume is for a given  temperature@xmath452 , the more stable triangulation pattern becomes .",
    "incidentally , ref.[102 ] is devoted to finding hyperbolic polyhedra with large volumes .",
    "* remark 5.6 .",
    "* very recently  statistical mechanics  of various physical systems with boltzmann factor containing volume ( including hyperbolic volume ) had been considered by atiyah and sutcliffe [ 106 ] .",
    "actually , these authors had considered instead of volume its logarithm .",
    "connections between the dyck paths , virasoro characters and exactly solvable lattice models had been known for some time [ 107 ] .moreover , since combinatorics of the dyck paths is directly associated with that for the catalan numbers , such connections are actually not totally unexpected since there are about 150 interpretations of the catalan numbers [ 42 ] .",
    "this , by the way , means that potentially there are much more applications of the w - k model than we had mentioned so far .",
    "it is not the purpose of  this subsection to provide the list of such applications .",
