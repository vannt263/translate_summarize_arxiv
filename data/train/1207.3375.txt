    "in cosmological models at present time the universe is assumed to have various ingredients of exotic nature like the dark energy candidates , among which we find the phantom scalar field @xcite .",
    "the reason is that supernovae ia data allow an equation of state of the dark energy component with @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the pressure and the energy density of the fluid , which is a condition that a phantom scalar field satisfies at cosmic scales .",
    "this is a reason to start up an exploration of the consequences such type of scalar field might have at local scales , for instance on black holes . on the other hand , the behavior of the area of the horizon when the black holes is accreting matter is a very important property of black hole physics , because the accretion of such exotic material may impose important restrictions on the mass of black nowadays black hole candidates .    in order to study this process in the full non - linear regime",
    "we start up with a model coupling the phantom scalar field and gravity .",
    "the model assumes the lagrangian density of the phantom scalar field is given by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the ricci scalar of the space - time , @xmath7 is the space - time metric , @xmath8 is a scalar field and @xmath9 is the potential of the field .",
    "the property defining a phantom scalar field is that the relative sign between the ricci scalar and the kinetic term are the same .",
    "when the action constructed with such a lagrangian density is varied with respect to the metric , the arising einstein s equations are related to a stress energy - tensor that violates the null energy condition , that is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a null vector .",
    "the immediate implication of this violation is the violation of the weak energy condition too , which in turn implies that observers following time - like trajectories might measure negative energy densities .",
    "although this property is at odds with the nowadays physics observed in laboratories , there are cosmological observations indicating the presence of such kind of matter@xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the implications of this at astrophysical scales .",
    "the fact that the scalar field violates the null energy condition motivates the study of possible unusual implications in astrophysical scenarios , because the area increasing theorem does not apply in this case . for instance , using exact solutions corresponding to stationary accretion of a test phantom fluid , it was found that the mass of black holes decreases in a phantom energy dominated universe approaching the big rip @xcite .",
    "it has also been studied recently the behavior of a black hole apparent horizon ( ah ) in a frw background , and the conditions under which a naked singularity can be formed due to the coincidence of the ah of the black hole and the cosmic horizon @xcite ; in such case the authors consider the effects of the back reaction of the scalar field on the space - time metric and indicate that cosmic censorship does not only forbid the existence of naked singularities but also the existence of a phantom field . assuming that the null energy condition is satisfied the area of the horizon only increase .",
    "however , if this condition is violated , the area of the event horizon decreases and the black hole shrinks as shown recently in the full non - linear regime using numerical relativity in @xcite . the present paper is a detailed follow up of previous one , in which we also explore the effects of the scalar field potential on the accretion rates and final state of the black hole .",
    "two important items are presented in this paper : i ) the relation @xmath12 is not fulfilled at local scales by the scalar field ( at least near to a black hole ) although the null energy condition is not satisfied and ii ) the accretion of such scalar field reduces the area of a black hole at similar rates for different types of potentials driving the scalar field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : cauchy ] we describe the 3 + 1 decomposition of the space - time , the evolution system of equations driving the evolution of the geometry and the construction of the initial data . in section [ sec : results ] we present the results obtained . finally in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we draw some conclusions and comments .",
    "we formulate einstein s field equations coupled to the scalar field in such a way that these can be integrated numerically . in this model",
    ", we will use spherical symmetry and use geometrized units for which the speed of light and newton s constant are equal to one .    in order to the study the dynamics of a spherically symmetric space - time , we write the general metric for the coordinate system @xmath13 in the following form @xmath14 , \\label{eq : metric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 acts as a conformal factor relating this metric to a space - like flat metric , @xmath16 is the only non - zero component of the shift vector and @xmath17 is the lapse function as in @xcite .",
    "we solve the evolution einstein s field equations using the generalized bssn evolution formulation of the 3 + 1 decomposition of general relativity described in @xcite as opposed to previous successful analyzes refereed to the accretion of scalar field using eddington - finkelstein like coordinates under the adm formulation @xcite .      for the construction of the space - time",
    "we carry out a cauchy - type evolution of initial data based on the 3 + 1 decomposition of the space - time . within such decomposition",
    "there are various formulations of the evolution equations with different hyperbolic properties . among such formulations",
    "the most popular nowadays is the so called bssn formulation @xcite which helped at solving the problem of the binary black hole collision system recently @xcite using the punctures technique that allowed the adequate treatment of the black hole singularity @xcite .",
    "the bssn formulation assumes that the conformal metric has determinant equal to one , but in spherical coordinates the flat metric the determinant is different to one . this issue is addressed relaxing this condition over the determinant , obtaining the generalized bssn equations ( gbssn ) @xcite , which is the formulation we use in our simulations . the gbssn system of equations in a spherically symmetric space - time reduce to a set of six equations for the independent dynamical variables @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the non - zero trace - free part of the extrinsic curvature @xmath20 , the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath21 and the contracted christoffel non - zero symbol ( conformal connection function ) @xmath22 .",
    "the explicit expressions in the presence of matter are :    @xmath23    where primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath24 and the gauge parameter @xmath25 is such that for @xmath26 the coordinates are eulerian , whereas for @xmath27 the coordinates are lagrangian .",
    "we have introduced the matter sources @xmath4 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 which represent the energy density , the momentum current density , the non - zero trace free part of the stress tensor and the trace of the stress tensor respectively .",
    "these quantities can be computed after projecting the stress - energy tensor onto the unit normal vector @xmath31 to the space - like hyper - surfaces ,    @xmath32    the constraints of the system are : the hamiltonian constraint @xmath33 , the momentum constraint @xmath34 and the constraint arising from the definition of the conformal connection functions @xmath35 . in spherical symmetry",
    "they are :    @xmath36    in order to specify the gauge , we evolve the lapse according to the standard 1+@xmath37 slicing condition    @xmath38    or the related condition obtained by dropping the advection term @xmath39 . for the shift vector we implemented the recipe for the @xmath40-driver condition    @xmath41    which helps to avoid the slice stretching near the horizon , which is known to kill the numerical evolution . in order to avoid instabilities near the origin ( the puncture )",

    "even though this function violates the constrains , the violations do not propagate out of the black hole horizon as shown by the convergence tests . in all our simulations we use eulerian coordinates ,",
    "that is , we set @xmath27 .",

    "in order to start up an evolution including the matter terms it is necessary to solve the constraints a the initial time slice , and afterwards bianchi identities guarantee that such constraints are satisfied .",
    "we assume that the initial slice is time - symmetric , which implies that the shift vector @xmath48 and its time derivative are zero initially .",
    "in addition , time symmetry imply that all the components of the extrinsic curvature are zero initially . in this way , the momentum constraint is satisfied identically at initial time . on the other hand",
    ", we use the pre - collapsed condition for the lapse @xmath49 .    in order to provide a local nature to the scalar field",
    "we assume that @xmath8 has a gaussian profile or is a train of gaussians one next to the other , which implies initial data for the first order variable @xmath50 , and the time symmetry provides the condition @xmath51 . with this information about the matter source",
    "we solve the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "now , in order to achieve a smooth coordinate system we use the initial ansatz that the space - time metric has a form similar to that of a schwarzschild black hole in isotropic coordinates .",
    "thus we assume that the metric at initial time has the form    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the mass of the apparent horizon and @xmath54 is the function to be determined through the solution of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is thus reduced to the equation    @xmath55    which we solve using a fourth order runge - kutta integrator . in the last equation ( [ eq : u ] ) , @xmath9 is the self - interaction potential of the phantom scalar field .",
    "we finally rescaled the coordinate @xmath24 in such way that @xmath56 when @xmath57 .",
    "these initial data are used to start up a cauchy type evolution using the gbssn evolution equations ( [ eq : gbbsn_evolution ] ) , the gauge conditions ( [ eq : lapse ] - [ eq : shift ] ) and the scalar field equation ( [ eq : sf_evolution ] ) .      the numerical method used to approximate the constraint and evolution equations is a fourth order finite differences approximation . we only perform the evolution on a finite domain with artificial boundaries at a finite value of @xmath24 where we implement radiative - type boundary conditions . the integration in time",
    "uses a method of lines with a fourth order accurate runge - kutta integrator . throughout the evolution",

    "_ misner - sharp mass function _ this quantity is a space - dependent measure of the mass of the space - time .",
    "we use this function in order to compare the mass of the apparent horizon and the mass of the space - time , so that we can monitor the consistency of our simulations . the misner - sharp mass function in our case",
    "is written as    @xmath69 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 .",
    "the misner - sharp mass reduces to the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) at space - like infinity ,    @xmath71    so we can estimate the mass of the space - time at a finite radius at any time during the evolution . on the other hand",
    ", the misner - sharp mass function reduces to the bondi - sachs mass at future null infinity .",
    "_ event horizon_. aside of the apparent horizon which is a gauge dependent 2-surface , we track a bundle of radial outgoing null rays in order to approximately locate the event horizon during the evolution as the 3-surface from which outgoing null rays diverge when launched toward the future .",
    "for this we solve the geodesic equation for radial null rays on the fly during the evolution , and fine - tune their location initially so that both , outgoing null rays escaping toward future null infinity and outgoing null rays that reach the singularity converge to the same surface for as much time as possible during the evolution , after which they spread .",
    "such surface is the approximate location of the event horizon .",
    "in fig . [ fig : id ] we show a particular case of an initial scalar field profile .",
    "we can see that the solution of the hamiltonian constraint implies already at initial time a negative energy density as expected from the violation of the null energy condition of this type of field .",
    "this also opens another possibility to be explored , that is , once we know that the scalar field contributes with a negative energy density it is also possible to construct initial configurations whose adm mass is negative , that is , the contribution of the scalar field energy density to the space - time is bigger in absolute value than that due to the black hole s horizon .    on the other hand , we also show in fig . [",

    "in our study we set up two classes of initial data corresponding to positive adm mass and negative adm mass for all the potentials studied . in order to reduce the parameter space of our study , for each potential we fine - tune the initial scalar field profile so that the adm mass has the same value for all the potentials explored .",

    "the finding is that despite of the potential used , the final mass of the apparent horizon is nearly the same in all cases , that is , the potential has no effect on the final state of the resulting black hole .    for both classes of configurations , positive and negative adm mass , we found that the apparent horizon mass decreases and converges asymptotically to the misner - sharp mass . as a particular example , we show in fig .",

    "the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : massadm ] is generic and applies to all the cases studied , that is , the event horizon -not only the apparent horizon- shrinks and is located approximately at the apparent horizon surfaces when the system has stabilized .    finally , in order to validate our numerical results we show in fig .",

    "we present the full non - linear spherical accretion of a phantom scalar field with various potentials into a black hole .",
    "this accretion process is very efficient at reducing the black hole horizon area , which is a potentially important process that may impose restrictions on the existing black hole masses , or for instance primordial black holes . in our simulations we were able to reduce the mass of the initial black hole up to 50@xmath85 .",
    "attempts to reduce the area even further presents difficulties with our approach due to the steep gradients in the equations near the origin , and other techniques might be implemented in order to sort this problem out .",
    "we show that the final mass of the black hole s horizon is nearly independent of the potential used .",
    "this results is physically interesting because the process of area reduction will apply independently of the cosmologically motivated potential used .",
    "we show that even though the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) of the scalar field corresponds to a phantom field , at local scales the radial equation of state is always @xmath86 , and it depends on space and time , with values ranging from a cosmological constant equation of state @xmath75 up to a stiff mater @xmath87 .",
    "we want to stress the importance of the equation of state of the scalar field given by the lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , and point out that perhaps the big rip scenario would strongly depend on the homogeneity and isotropy of the scalar field .",
