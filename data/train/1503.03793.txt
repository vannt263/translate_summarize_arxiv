    "quantum effects are expected to drastically affect the structure of space and time at the smallest of scales . however , our current theories of gravity and quantum mechanics are ( fortunately ) very stingy with the options they leave us as far as the small scale of structure of spacetime is concerned .",
    "for example , attempts to model such a structure by violating or deforming lorentz invariance ( li ) are either very strongly constrained by experiments , or run into deeper conceptual issues when one goes beyond the simple one - particle models .",
    "it is much more plausible that instead of li , it is the assumption of locality that might have to be given up at small scales @xcite .",
    "however , abandoning locality then also necessitates that we give up the classical description of spacetime in terms of local tensorial objects , in particular the metric tensor @xmath1 .",
    "finding the right geometric variables that can describe spacetime geometry down to smallest scales is of utmost significant not only for quantum gravity , but also for the proper physical interpretation of the field equations of gravity at the classical level .",
    "in particular , the deep connection between einstein equations , thermodynamics , and information theory that has been studied in depth for over a decade very strongly suggests that we question the conventional description of gravitational dynamics based on einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action . in any case , to properly understand the implications of results that have been accumulated from the study of quantum fields in curved spacetime , it is extremely important that one must first identify the correct geometric variables to describe spacetime geometry at the classical level itself .",
    "fortunately , the hint for doing so also comes from these very same results .",
    "in particular , one of the most significant results to have come out of semiclassical studies is the existence of a minimal spacetime length , say @xmath9 , below which spacetime intervals loose any operational significance @xcite .",
    "such a _ zero - point length _ appears in various forms in several candidate models of quantum gravity , and is often considered as the universal regulator for divergences in quantum field theory ( qft ) and general relativity ( gr ) . in a recent work ,",
    "one of us @xcite proposed that a more appropriate description of spacetime geometry in presence of a minimal length scale must be based on non - local bi - tensors instead of the metric tensor .",
    "the geodesic distance between two spacetime events , in particular , was proposed as a more fundamental object than the metric tensor .",
    "the relevant bi - tensor in this context is the so called synge world function @xmath2 defined by @xcite @xmath23(x(\\lambda ) ) \\dm \\lambda \\nn \\\\ &",
    "= & \\frac{1}{2 } \\sigma(p , p_0)^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the square of geodesic interval , with the corresponding geodesic distance given by @xmath25 here , @xmath26 is tangent to the geodesics , and @xmath27 .",
    "( in this paper , we shall use @xmath28 and @xmath29 interchangeably to keep the expressions and notation convenient .",
    "we will also often use @xmath30 in covariant taylor series to keep track of terms of various orders without messing up the notation . )    assuming that the small scale structure of spacetime is characterised ( at least at a semiclassical level ) by the existence of a minimal length , it was shown that one can construct a second rank bi - tensor , @xmath31 , such that it yields geodesic distances with a lower bound @xmath9 .",
    "the construction of @xmath15 in @xcite was based on two inputs :    * p1 : * the requirement that geodesic distances have a lorentz invariant lower bound _ and _ this arises from modification of geodesic distances as @xmath32 .",
    "* p2 : * the requirement that the modified dalembartian @xmath14 yields the following modification for the two point functions @xmath33 of fields in _ flat spacetime _ : @xmath34 \\rightarrow \\widetilde g\\l[\\sigma^2\\r ] = g\\l [ \\sigma^2 + \\lp^2 \\r]$ ] .",
    "( this essentially regulates the uv divergences in qft , and is based on several earlier works on the subject . )    these two requirements then completely fix the form of @xmath15 .",
    "being manifestly covariant , the extension to arbitrary curved spacetimes suggests itself naturally .    in subsequent work @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the ricci bi - scalar @xmath16 corresponding to this so called _ qmetric _",
    "@xmath15 has a very specific non - analytic structure which results in a non - trivial result for the coincidence limit @xmath35 $ ] when @xmath36 .",
    "the specific result proved there was @xmath37 with @xmath26 being arbitrary normalised vectors at each spacetime event .",
    "a similar analysis for the surface term @xmath38 of the eh action was also presented subsequently , and the very same term as above was shown to appear there as well ( see second reference in @xcite ) .",
    "the above results have many deep implications , in particular for understanding better the notion of entropy associated with each spacetime event @xmath6 and it s causal boundaries , and for the _ emergent gravity paradigm _ ; these were discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "they not only provide a very strong hint towards the importance of the quantity @xmath39 in description of gravitational dynamics , but also give a precise quantitative manner in which the transmutation of gravitational lagrangian @xmath40 can arise as a relic of a minimal length . on the other hand",
    ", the analysis presented in @xcite does not give much insight on the robustness of the conclusions drawn from the final result , and much less insight on some of the miraculous cancellations responsible for it .",
    "in particular , the following issues concerning the main inputs * p1 * and * p2 * were left unclear :    \\1 . the analysis _ assumed _ ( see * p1 * ) that a lower bound on geodesic distances is realized via the modification @xmath32 .",
    "while the motivation for such a modification comes from several older results , it remained unclear as to how much the final result depends on it .",
    "this question is of fundamental significance , since the precise manner in which a minimal length is introduced in spacetime can come only from a complete framework of quantum gravity . in absence of such a framework ,",
    "it is important not to make any assumptions on how distances can get modified . in particular",
    ", the modifications introduced by quantum gravity can be non - perturbative , and hence need not possess a series expansion in @xmath9 near @xmath41 .    in this paper",
    ", we shall establish our result without making any such assumption .",
    "technically , we shall keep the function @xmath18 , which represents modification of distances , completely arbitrary and satisfying only @xmath21(0 ) < \\infty$ ] in addition to it s defining properties ( which will be given below ) .",
    "in particular , the function @xmath42 need not admit a perturbative expansion in @xmath9 , unlike the form @xmath43 which was used in @xcite .",
    "the construction of @xmath15 for arbitrary @xmath22 was already sketched in appendix a of @xcite , except for a crucial difference , which brings us to our second point concerning the input * p2*.    \\2 .",
    "the requirement * p2 * that two point functions get modified as @xmath34 \\rightarrow \\widetilde g\\l[\\sigma^2\\r ]",
    "= g\\l [ \\sigma^2 + \\lp^2 \\r]$ ] makes sense only when @xmath33 depends on @xmath44 and @xmath6 only through @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "this can not happen in arbitrary curved spacetimes , which very much reduces the possibilities available to fix the qmetric .",
    "this is , of course , good , since it reduces the room available for _ adhoc _ choices .",
    "the most general space(time)s in which @xmath33 is only a function of @xmath45 @xmath46 are the maximally symmetric spaces , of which flat space(time ) is but the simplest possibility with zero curvature .",
    "fixing the qmetric based on flat spacetime , although it captures the correct leading singularity of the two point functions in the coincidence limit , wipes away all information about curvature .",
    "more precisely , the leading singular structure of two point functions associated with the dalembartian @xmath47 in arbitrary spacetime is given by the hadamard form @xmath48 as is evident , the information about curvature , at the leading order , therefore appears in the two point functions through the so called van vleck determinant ( vvd ) @xmath3 . in flat spacetime , @xmath49 exactly , whereas in arbitrary curved spacetimes , @xmath50 one might therefore think that the dependence of qmetric on @xmath3 can not possibly affect the coincidence limit of the ricci biscalar @xmath16 ( or any other curvature invariant ) associated with @xmath15 .",
    "this expectation is , however , wrong .",
    "curvature involves second derivatives of the metric , and the coincidence limit of the second ( or higher ) derivatives of @xmath3 is not zero in general .",
    "( the exact form of the coefficients in covariant taylor expansion of vvd are well known , and are quoted later in this paper . )",
    "this makes it crucial to identify the dependence of qmetric on vvd .",
    "as we shall show , doing so leads to some remarkable results , all following from certain identities satisfied by the vvd .",
    "the modified @xmath16 derived in @xcite is in fact singular in the coincidence limit @xmath51 .",
    "this divergence is cubic in @xmath26 s , and can be regularised using known methods in point splitting regularisation , as was suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , this still leaves a certain amount of discomfort at the mathematical level .",
    "it does not make much sense to appeal to point splitting regularisation since our starting point , based on existence of a minimal length , does not invoke point splitting at any level , but is instead based on use of a non local second rank bi - tensor .",
    "it is therefore important to have a deeper look at this divergence and it s origin , particularly so because it depends on @xmath52 and hence vanishes for all maximally symmetric spaces !",
    "the argument given in 2 above advocating the use of maximally symmetric spaces therefore is not expected to help here , since the divergence is anyway zero for these spaces .",
    "one requires a much more mathematically rigorous analysis to probe the structure of this divergent term .",
    "as we shall show , identifying the correct dependence of @xmath15 on the vvd in fact cancels this divergence in a rather surprising manner .",
    "in fact , the reason for this cancellation is buried deep within the expansion of extrinsic curvature of _ equi - geodesic surfaces _ @xmath7 ( see below ) in an arbitrary spacetime to @xmath53th order in covariant taylor series , and a close relationship between vvd and extrinsic curvature of @xmath7 .",
    "we address all the above issues in this paper , and while doing so , reveal the mathematical robustness of the final result , and hence it s inevitability ( given the two basic inputs ) in any theory which admits a li short distance cut - off .",
    "our key inputs would be much less restrictive and/or specialized than the ones used in @xcite , which makes the results presented here significantly stronger .",
    "these can be stated as :    * q1 : * the requirement that geodesic distances have a lorentz invariant lower bound .    *",
    "q2 : * the requirement that the modified dalembartian @xmath14 yields the following modification for the two point functions @xmath33 of fields in _ all maximally symmetric spacetimes _ : @xmath34 \\rightarrow \\widetilde g\\l[\\sigma^2\\r ] = g\\l [ { \\mathcal s}_{\\lp}\\l [ \\sigma^2 \\r ] \\r]$ ] .    as is evident , these inputs are much more minimalistic compared with * p1 , p2 * , and hence can be expected to provide much more general insights into small scale structure of spacetime .",
    "the paper is structured as follows :    sec .",
    "[ sec : vvd ] : in this section , we discuss the geodesic structure of arbitrary curved space(time)s , with focus on intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of equi - geodesic surfaces @xmath7 @xcite , which comprise of points @xmath44 which are at some constant geodesic distance @xmath45 from @xmath6 , and connected to @xmath6 by non - null geodesics .",
    "we also discuss the geometric significance of vvd in studying the small scale structure of spacetime , and highlight some elementary identities relating derivatives of vvd to the extrinsic curvature of @xmath7 , which are used later in sec .",
    "[ sec : rs ] .",
    "[ sec : qmetric ] : we present the derivation of the 2nd rank bi - tensor , the qmetric @xmath31 , based on the two inputs * q1 , q2 * stated above .",

    "it is then shown @xmath35(p_0 ) \\neq { \\rm \\bf ric}(p_0)$ ] , which is one of the key results of this paper",
    "[ sec : ksqrth ] : in this section , we complete our analysis of the eh action by evaluating the gibbons - hawking - york ( ghy ) surface term in the action on equi - geodesic surfaces , for the qmetric .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we finally conclude with a general discussion and implications of the results obtained in this work .    the key results of this paper are contained in the boxed eqs .",
    "( [ eq : qmfinal ] ) , ( [ eq : finalrsq ] ) and ( [ eq : grin ] ) .",
    "we work in @xmath54 dimensions , and use the sign convention @xmath55 for lorentzian spaces .",
    "latin alphabets denote spacetime indices .",
    "also , for notational convenience , we use @xmath56 throughout to denote short distance cutoff on geodesic distances ; for timelike / spacelike cases , the replacement @xmath57 must be made in the final results after which @xmath58 .",
    "for convenience , we give below a quick list of some of the most recurring symbols / notation used in the text : +   + @xmath59 @xmath60 + @xmath59 @xmath61 + @xmath59 @xmath62 + @xmath63 @xmath64 + @xmath59 @xmath35(p_0)$ ] is the coincidence limit of @xmath16",
    "mathematically , a key role in our analysis would be played by the congruence of geodesics emanating from a fixed spacetime event @xmath6 and the surface comprised of events @xmath44 lying at constant geodesic interval from @xmath6 , which we call as the _ equi - geodesic _ surface of event @xmath6 and denote it by @xmath7 .",
    "the relevant geometrical properties of such surfaces in arbitrary curved spacetimes were discussed in @xcite , and we simply quote the results which we will need here .",
    "we start with the affinely parametrized tangent vector @xmath26 to the geodesic connecting @xmath6 to @xmath44 @xmath65 and note that it is also the normal to @xmath7 .",
    "the extrinsic curvature tensor of @xmath7 , is therefore given by @xmath66 this particular foliation , which characterizes the local geodesic structure of any spacetime , has many interesting properties , and all of these derive from the well known covariant taylor series expansion of the bi - tensor @xmath67 at @xmath44 near @xmath6 @xcite : @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we see that the extrinsic geometry of such a equi - geodesic  foliation \" is very special , and completely characterized by the _ tidal tensor _ @xmath70 . in fact , the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures can be characterized by systematic taylor expansions around @xmath6 , given by @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 , and @xmath73 . for later use",
    ", we also quote here the combination ( easily derived from above ) :    @xmath74    for any arbitrary @xmath75 .",
    "as we shall see , the structure of the above expression , which requires keeping upto @xmath53th order terms in @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( that is , terms of @xmath78 ) , hold the key to elimination of coincidence limit divergences in @xmath16 , in conjunction with a couple of differential identities ( involving @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) satisfied by the vvd , which we discuss next .",
    "the van vleck determinant , @xmath3 , is an extremely important object in semi - classical physics .",
    "geometrically , this bi - scalar governs the properties of geodesic congruences emanating from a point , say @xmath6 , as a function of an arbitrary point @xmath44 .",
    "the immense physical importance of this object certainly warrants a longer discussion than presented here , and we refer the reader to @xcite for the same .",
    "in fact , as we shall see , the geometrical significance of vvd holds the key to its relevance for the small scale structure of spacetime , a theme that will resonate constantly throughout this paper .",
    "the vvd is defined as follows : @xmath79 two of the most important differential identities that we shall use , connecting the vvd with the extrinsic curvature of @xmath7 , are the following : @xmath80 where @xmath69 and @xmath81 .",

    "the relevance of such a description has gained increased attention since the proposal by jacobson @xcite of using local rindler frames as probes of gravitational dynamics .",
    "we shall focus on the equi - geodesic surfaces @xmath7 straddling the causal boundaries of an arbitrary event @xmath6 , and briefly comment on the null limit in the end .",
    "the complete eh action is given by @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 are covariant volume elements in bulk and boundary respectively .",
    "the subtraction term , @xmath93 , is usually taken to be the trace of extrinsic curvature of the boundary surface embedded in flat spacetime .",
    "usually , the boundary @xmath94 is taken at infinity . however , given the fact that the causal structure of spacetime limits the amount of information accessible at an event @xmath6 , it is interesting to ask for the contribution of the boundaries @xmath7 ( which , in the null limit , would make the null cone of @xmath6 ) .",
    "we therefore write @xmath95 ( note the subscript @xmath6 on @xmath96 ; we put it as a reminder that we are now focussing on quantities from the point of view of a specific event ( observer ) @xmath6 . )    the trace of extrinsic curvature of @xmath7 , as embedded in _",

    "let us now comment briefly on the null limit .",
    "since the term @xmath8 is purely geometrical , we expect the null limit of the bulk term above to be straightforward . however , we must point out that the issue of boundary term for null boundaries is not completely unambiguous @xcite , and it might therefore require more care to repeat the above steps for a strictly null surface .",
    "the above analysis strongly suggests that an observer dependent study of gravitational dynamics might require us to change the conventional description based on eh lagrangian . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we will actually present a much stronger result suggesting a very natural transmutation of gravitational lagrangian from @xmath103 to @xmath39 in presence of a lorentz invariant short distance cut - off .",

    "since @xmath22 represents ( in general non - perturbative ) effects of quantum gravity on invariant distance between spacetime events , the non - existence of higher derivatives of @xmath42 in @xmath16 is of deep conceptual importance  it tells us that semi - classical effects of quantum gravity can be captured only via limited information about the precise details of quantum gravity .",

    "the contribution from @xmath171 and @xmath165 can only be @xmath172 , since @xmath19 .",
    "let us therefore first focus on @xmath170 .    to do this",

    "these terms can be read off from the known covariant taylor expansions of the vvd .",

    "in the previous section , we analyzed the ricci bi - scalar @xmath16 for the qmetric and showed that it s coincidence limit becomes proportional to @xmath184 in the limit @xmath185 .",
    "we now calculate the contribution of the surface term @xmath186 for the equi - geodesic surfaces using the qmetric .",
    "this is a much simpler calculation than that of @xmath16 , and is along the same lines as the one given in @xcite ( second reference ) , so we will be brief .",
    "we start with the following relation between induced metrics and the extrinsic curvatures @xcite @xmath187 since by definition @xmath188 , the series for @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : taylor - exp ] ) readily yields @xmath189 putting everything together , we get @xmath190 the above limit of the surface term corresponds to the surfaces @xmath7 straddling very close to the causal horizon of @xmath6 . if one takes the limit @xmath36 above , it gives zero , and hence there is no non - trivial effect on the surface term as was found in @xmath16 .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , one needs only a very few conceptual inputs from semiclassical gravity to deduce some basic facts about spacetime at small scales .",
    "the existence of a lower bound on spacetime intervals is one such input , and if it turns out to be a fundamental feature of quantum gravity , it makes sense to look for a geometric description of spacetime in terms of objects which are likely to be more useful in incorporating such a lower bound .",
    "bi - tensors , then , provide a natural choice , and indeed , if one looks deeper into our theories of classical gr and qft , some of the most important features of these theories , such as geodesic deviation , focussing of geodesics , causal structure , singularity structure of two point functions etc , are characterized in terms of bi - tensors . characterizing the small scale topology of spacetime",
    "is another aspect which would necessitate a description directly in terms of bi - tensors such as the distance function @xmath29 .",
    "this is the point of view which was stressed in @xcite , developed and described in much greater conceptual detail in @xcite , and has been put on a much more rigorous basis in the present paper .",
    "our general expression ( [ eq : finalrsq ] ) for the ricci bi - scalar @xmath16 of the qmetric presents a natural basis for the description of gravitational dynamics by a non - local action",
    ". this can be particularly relevant for study of spacetime singularities , where one can not use covariant taylor expansions .",
    "although mathematical complexity forced us to look at only the ricci scalar ( instead of the full riemann tensor ) for geometries with a covariant short distance cut - off , the resulting expression very elegantly and concretely expresses the key idea : curvature of spacetime might be solely expressible in terms of behaviour of it s geodesics and related bi - tensorial quantites . in absence of a lower bound on geodesic distances ,",
    "such a description would coincide with the standard one in terms of local tensors such as @xmath192 etc .",
    "however , if there exists a minimal length , then the non - local character of bi - tensors , combined with the non - analytic deformation of geometry necessitated by such a minimal length , might lead to a very different description of spacetime curvature at smallest of scales ; in particular , it may leave a relic independent of the details or value of the short distance cut - off , thereby acting as a crucial guidepost towards our understanding of classical gravity itself .",
    "the mathematical results derived here , for example , seem to strongly support the so called emergent gravity paradigm , in which gravitational dynamics is described in terms of thermodynamics of future causal horizon of an event @xmath6 .",
    "two of the key ideas in this context  the use of _ local rindler frames _ as probes of spacetime curvature ( due to jacobson @xcite ) , and a variational principle based on _ entropy functional _ ( due to padmanabhan et .",
    "@xcite )  find a unified and purely geometric description in our framework in terms of equi - geodesic _ surfaces _ ( which replace the rindler _ trajectories _ ) and the @xmath193 term of the coincidence limit of ricci bi - scalar of the qmetric , which happens to have the same form as the entropy functional .",
    "the possibility of description of geometry in terms of two point functions of quantum fields has also been emphasized , in a series of paper , by kempf and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the connection with the work presented here is obvious : the uv behavior of two point functions is in one to one correspondence with vanishing of geodesic distances in the coincidence limit , which , of course , was the basis for our input * q2*. in fact , there could also be a more fundamental connection at the level of geometry itself .",
    "for example , it was pointed out in @xcite that the commutation relation between position and momenta , @xmath194 $ ] , would in general acquire a correction on a curved manifold , thereby affecting the resultant uncertainties .",
    "we hope to present more details on this particular connection in a future work ( which is in progress ) .",
    "we hope to apply the results derived here to analyze implications of a lorentz invariant minimal length for issues such as cosmological and black hole singularities , trans - planckian problem in black hole physics and cosmology , and possible relevance for the cosmological constant problem .",
