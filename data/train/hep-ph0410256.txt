    "it is believed that the standard model ( sm ) is an effective low energy theory which has to be completed at some scale to include gravity .",
    "what aspects of this extension will show up first at large colliders will have to wait for new experimental data . in order to establish a departure from the sm predictions it will be probably necessary a new large striking signal .",
    "however , we will have to start carefully looking at the processes where the sm is less precisely known , like at the top or at the higgs , or where clean signals can be observed , like lepton pair or monojet production .    the most popular low energy extension of the sm is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "its main virtues are to make less severe the hierarchy problem : how to keep the higgs boson mass 16 orders of magnitude lighter than the planck scale @xmath0 , and to unify the gauge coupling constants of the three sm interactions near this scale .",
    "its phenomenology is discussed in other contributions to these proceedings ( see @xcite for some recent reviews where this network has contributed ) . however , there are also other sm extensions which ameliorate its fine - tuning problems , and whose signatures can be also observable at large hadron colliders , like the tevatron and the lhc , or at a large ( international ) linear lepton collider ( ilc ) . in the following we review some of the implications of recent alternatives which may manifest at the top ( section 2 ) , at the higgs ( section 3 ) , in lepton pair production with a large invariant mass ( section 4 ) , and/or as an excess of monojets ( section 5 ) .",
    "two generic examples of alternative scenarios are the little higgs model @xcite and large extra dimensions @xcite ( for recent ( phenomelogical ) reviews see @xcite ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "the former explotes our knowledge of four - dimensional gauge theories .",
    "it improves the hierachy problem related with the stability of the higgs mass enlarging the sm to include a larger global symmetry at a higher scale @xmath1 , with a locally gauged subgroup containing the sm gauge group .",
    "its breaking above the @xmath2 is communicated to the sm higgs doublet , which is a pseudo - goldstone boson , through radiative corrections , and then , it is delayed by factors of @xmath3 times coupling constants .",
    "the extra fields of its littlest version @xcite are a charged @xmath4 vector - like quark @xmath5 , a complex scalar triplet @xmath6 , and four new gauge bosons @xmath7 ; all of them with masses near the @xmath2 scale , and eventually observable .",
    "on the other hand , the possibility of having observable large extra spatial dimensions raised in @xcite allows to reformulate the hierarchy problem . in this scenario",
    "there is only one fundamental scale of the order of the @xmath2 , with some models being even higgsless @xcite .",
    "the sm fields must mainly live in our four - dimensional brane , but can propagate , as does gravity , in the extra dimensions depending on the model assumptions . in this case new physics manifests as towers of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states , which , if light enough , would be observable at large colliders .",
    "thus , we may want to know how to search for them . in practice",
    ", one can consider only the first massive states as we do below : new gauge bosons with the sm couplings but with heavier masses , new vector - like fermions with the sm quantum numbers and/or extra scalar replicas .",
    "this new framework also offers a new playground for dealing with other sm puzzles , as for instance , the necessity of accommodating the very different fermion masses observed in nature .",
    "the paradigmatic example is the very small neutrino masses .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that if right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos living in the bulk exist , their wave - function values on the brane where the standard left - handed ( lh ) neutrinos stay can be effectively so small as to explain the tiny dirac neutrino masses observed ; although to write definite realistic models , other mechanisms may be also required . the neutrino mass generation ( see @xcite for a review , and @xcite for the extra dimensional view ) , as the measured neutrino masses @xmath8 , is not directly distinguishable at large colliders , because any related effect is suppressed by very small ratios @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the collider center of mass energy .",
    "new neutrino effects at colliders must be associated to leptons with masses @xmath11 and relatively large mixings with the sm fermions .",
    "these new leptons ( neutrinos ) , which may be also light kk modes , are discussed in other contribution to these proceedings @xcite ( see also @xcite and references there in ) .    here",
    "we will be concerned with the ( top ) quark sector .",
    "the observed hierarchy between the light quarks and the top can be related to their localisation in the extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "indeed , simple models with one extra dimension and quarks propagating in the bulk can reproduce the observed pattern of quark masses and mixings @xcite , and predict new vector - like quarks below the @xmath2 scale .",
    "hence , a precise measurement of the top coupling @xmath12 and the search of new heavy quarks at large colliders will constrain these models as well .",
    "both sm alternatives , the little higgs model and the large extra dimensions , are more a class of models than definite complete theories .",
    "their predictions are mainly estimates which may depend on unexpected new effects .",
    "this is the case in models with extra dimensions , for instance , of the so - called brane kinetic terms ( bkt ) .",
    "these are corrections to the kinetic terms of the bulk fields which are localised at the branes .",
    "they were first discussed in the context of gravity @xcite , but they are generated for bulk fields already at one loop in compactification with defects , as for instance in orbifolds @xcite .",
    "they are phenomenologically relevant @xcite , and deserve further theoretical study @xcite ( see @xcite for a more complete set of references ) .",
    "a review @xcite can be found in these proceedings .    finally , as a last recent example of alternative to the mssm it is worth to mention split supersymmetry @xcite . in this proposal",
    "squarks and sleptons are very heavy and can not even mediate the dominant decays of gauginos and higgsinos , which remain near the electroweak scale .",
    "the sm superpartners are thus split .",
    "the plethora of new sparticles expected to be produced at forthcoming experiments in the mssm gets reduced to some new ( majorana ) fermions appearing , as we shall comment in section 5 , mainly as missing energy , plus a jet , for instance , in the gluino case . a general discussion of the main phenomenological differences with traditional low - scale supersymmetry ( susy ) , with emphasis in the cosmological aspects , is given in @xcite .",
    "large colliders will be top factories .",
    "in particular the lhc with a cross section of @xmath13 will produce tens of millions of top pairs @xcite ( see also @xcite in these proceedings ) , and a large number of pairs of any new heavy quark which may exist with a mass up to several @xmath2 .",
    "single top production will be down by more than an order of magnitude , but it will give the best measurement of the top coupling to the @xmath14 , @xmath12 , with an expected precision of @xmath15 @xcite . the top coupling to the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , will be measured with a better precision at ilc , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "these two measurements could give evidence of new physics if different from their sm values @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the most probable explanation of such a large deviation @xmath21 from the sm predictions would be the top mixing with other vector - like quark of charge @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , alternative sm extensions like the little higgs model or extra dimensions predict such new vector - like quarks @xcite .    in the simplest case of only one effective light @xmath5 quark the @xmath22 quark system is parameterised by the two quark masses @xmath23 and its mixing angle @xmath24 ( @xmath25 can be taken equal to 1 ) .",
    "the corresponding mass matrix reads @xmath26 where the rh quarks ( columns ) have been rotated and the field phases chosen conveniently , and @xmath27 is a small expansion parameter .",
    "the physics of this sm addition has been often discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "we follow the analysis in @xcite .",
    "the main constraint from precise electroweak data results from the _ oblique _",
    "@xmath28 this latest value differs significatively from the value quoted in @xcite but it has been obtained fixing the parameter @xmath29 , what seems more adequate for this type of sm extensions .",
    "t is a function of the @xmath5 mass and of its couplings to the @xmath14 and to the @xmath16 squared , @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively . its approximate expression can be written ( @xmath32 ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of colours , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 taken equal to @xmath37 are the @xmath38 values of the electroweak mixing angle and the top mass at the @xmath39 scale , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]    we plot the experimentally excluded region ( shadowed ) of the @xmath40 plane @xcite .",
    "the limiting curve defines the 3 standard deviation bound @xmath41 , and only masses and mixings on the top - left part are allowed .    in the little higgs model @xcite @xmath42 with @xmath43 two couplings of @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the higgs doublet vacuum expectation value , and @xmath47 naturally ranging from 1 up to 5 @xmath2 , but otherwise arbitrary .",
    "( in more restrictive models of this class the non - observation of an excess of lepton pairs at tevatron banishes @xmath47 to higher values @xcite . ) then eq .",
    "( [ at ] ) and the 3 @xmath48 limit on t above further constrain @xmath49 for large @xmath47 . hence , already for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and no distinction between the little higgs model and the sm can be made with the foreseen precision for the @xmath12 measurement .",
    "on the other hand , models with extra dimensions and multilocalisation can accommodate smaller @xmath47 and @xmath12 values @xcite . in these models they fix two free parameters : the five - dimensional top mass and the position of the intermediate brane .",
    "the allowed @xmath40 region can be also reached in the simplest models without multilocalisation if relatively large bkt are included @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we draw lines of constant compactification scale @xmath52 and growing bkt from right to left .",
    "a model with excluded values in the shadowed region can predict allowed @xmath47 masses and @xmath12 couplings increasing ( moving from right to left along the lines ) the bkt coefficient . in summary , a new vector - like @xmath5 quark with a large mixing with the top",
    "could be the first signal of extra dimensions .",
    "we plot the cross sections for different @xmath5 production processes at lhc @xcite .",
    "@xmath56 production is fixed by qcd and its cross section decreases faster with @xmath47 because the @xmath57-channel interchanges the @xmath5 quark and the @xmath58-channel is relatively suppressed at high energy ( fig .
