    "in recent times , the high redshift frontier has started to probe the epoch of reionization because of extensive observations at near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths .",
    "this extension of multi - wavelength galaxy surveys to obtain deep images at observed nir has provided a new prospect for the study of galaxies at high ( @xmath6 ) redshifts .",
    "such observations are vital to identify star - forming high redshift objects by sampling their rest - frame uv light , and for estimating their star formation properties . on the other hand , the combination of _ spitzer_/irac and nir observations can be used to identify massive , evolved balmer break galaxies ( bbgs ) at @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , relative insensitivity at these wavelengths to the stellar population mix , dust and k - correction , specially at intermediate ( @xmath17 ) redshifts is an added bonus .    among the most extensive datasets available in extragalactic astronomy ,",
    "is the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; * ? ? ?",
    "this consists of imaging of two fields ( goods - north and goods - south ) , by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in four optical bands ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath5 ) .",

    "* ) in the @xmath0 , @xmath21 and @xmath1  bands , but the goods - north ( goods - n ) field has not had such full - field deep coverage at these wavelengths . in the last few years , the wide - field infrared camera ( wircam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , and the multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ; * ? ? ?",

    "various studies have used subsets of these observations for specific science goals .",
    "for example , @xcite used moircs  data to investigate the number counts of distant red galaxies , while @xcite used moircs@xmath1-band selected galaxies to measure clustering properties of low - mass galaxies at @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite used nir observations from both goods fields to investigate the dependence on stellar mass and galaxy type of the close pair fractions and implied merger rate , while @xcite used the deepest nir observations from both fields to search for star - forming galaxies at @xmath6 and constrain their rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) luminosity functions .",
    "these studies show the significance of nir observations in such well - studied fields .",
    "the full coverage of the goods - n region is essential not only to expand these studies , but also to accomplish larger number of additional science goals . despite such studies ,",
    "there is limited information in literature of the observational details and sensitivities of the nir data for goods - n field , and details about source detection .",
    "the high sensitivity of the _ hst_/wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) has made it possible to identify faint lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath6 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , because most of these candidates are very faint ( ab@xmath2327  mag ) , it is difficult to measure their spectra or measure their rest - frame optical seds to better constrain their stellar population and mass .",
    "it is imperative to search for relatively brighter ( ab@xmath2425  mag ) galaxies at @xmath6 , and study them in great detail .",
    "there are three principal ways to accomplish this goal .",
    "first approach is through big cluster surveys , which are searching for lensed galaxies at",
    "@xmath6  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these galaxies are intrinsically faint but because of the magnification their observed magnitudes are relatively bright .",
    "second approach is to take advantage of the _ hst _ parallel observations ( e.g , .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to explore large number of random fields at relatively shallow depth , and the final approach is to perform wide area ground - based surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to identify and study such bright candidates .",
    "these methods are starting to identify bright galaxy candidates at @xmath6and are putting important constraints on the bright end of the rest - frame uv luminosity functions , though the number of these candidates remains too small to make any statistically significant conclusions about their physical properties .",
    "the wide area ground - based surveys have few distinct advantages compared to space - based approaches of identifying bright high redshift ( @xmath6 ) galaxies .",
    "first , they can cover much larger area than space - based observations , and secondly , the @xmath1-band data , which is important for accessing the reliability of high redshift candidates , is only available through ground - based telescopes .",
    "these reasons make nir ground - based surveys very appealing for searching bright high redshift galaxies .    here , we present nir data in the goods - n field obtained using the cfht / wircam  and the subaru / moircs  instruments .",
    "we combine the archival data from these instruments to generate deeper images in @xmath0- and @xmath1-bands .",
    "the subaru / moircs  data cover @xmath260% of the central goods - n region in @xmath0 , @xmath21 , @xmath1-filters , while the cfht / wircamcovers a much larger area , extending well beyond the goods - n field in the @xmath0 , @xmath1-filters .",
