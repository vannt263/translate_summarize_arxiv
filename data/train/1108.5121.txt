    "we analyze the dynamical symmetries which arise when a group theoretical approach is used in the description of a contact between a few electron nanosystem @xmath2 with definite symmetry @xmath3 and a macroscopic system @xmath4 ( `` bath '' or `` reservoir '' ) . due to this contact the symmetries of the system @xmath2 and",

    "the dynamical symmetry group technique offers mathematical tools for the unified approach to quantum objects , which allows one to consider not only the spectrum of a system @xmath2 , but also its response to external perturbation violating the symmetry @xmath3 and various complex many - body effects characterizing the interaction between the system @xmath8 and its environment @xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we discuss a general algorithm of dynamical symmetry group approach to the few electron objects @xmath9 and its practical application to the single - electron tunneling in complex quantum dots and single molecule transistors .",
    "this tunneling is described in a framework of the anderson model with repulsive and attractive interaction between the confined electrons .",
    "following the definition used in ref . , we define the dynamical symmetry group @xmath10 as a lie group of finite dimension characterized by the irreducible representations which act in the whole hilbert space of eigenstates @xmath11 of the schroedinger equation @xmath12 describing the quantum system @xmath2 . here",

    "the operators @xmath29 were exploited by j. hubbard as a convenient tool for description of elementary excitations in strongly correlated electron systems ( sces ) . his seminal model of interacting electron motion in a narrow band , known now as the hubbard model @xcite was the first microscopic model of sces for which the conventional perturbative approach based on the landau fermi liquid hypothesis turned out to fail .",
    "now the realm of sces is really vast , and the most of artificial nanostructures in fact belong to this realm .",
    "in particular , complex quantum dots under strong coulomb blockade are typical examples of short hubbard chains or rings .",
    "the hubbard operators ( [ 2.4 ] ) obeying the commutation relation ( [ 2.1a ] ) provide a convenient tool for construction of the algebras generating the dynamical symmetry groups of the schroedinger operator @xmath36 or theresolvent operator @xmath37 .",

    "the clebsch - gordan expansion ( [ 2.5 ] ) is the basic equation which allows one to treat the dynamical symmetries of nanoobjects in a systematic way .",
    "the principal difference between the dynamical symmetries of sces and those of integrable models is that in the latter case the spectrum of the object and its dynamical symmetries are known exactly , while in the former case as a rule only some part of excitation spectra ( usually its lower part ) may be found analytically and classified by symmetry .",
    "this means that one may judge about the dynamical symmetry of the spectrum only within the definite energy interval @xmath47 . respectively",

    "@xcite the kondo effect arises as a result of orthogonality catastrophe in the anderson model,@xcite where the conduction electrons in the fermi sea of metallic electrodes play part of the subsystem @xmath4 and the strongly correlated electrons in the quantum dot represent the subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "the largest energy scales in the anderson model are the width of conduction band @xmath48 in the subsystem @xmath4 and the energy of coulomb blockade @xmath49 in the subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "the electrons confined in the nanoobject ( quantum dot ) are characterized by the ionization energy @xmath50 .",

    "@xmath53 is the density of electron states at the fermi level @xmath54 of the electron liquid in the leads .",
    "the kondo effect arises in the single - electron tunneling regime under the restrictions of strong coulomb blockade @xmath49 . in this regime",
    "the charge transport between the source and drain electrodes constituting the subsystem @xmath55 is realized as the electron cotunneling , where an electron from the source may tunnel into the dot @xmath56 only provided another electron leaves the dot for the drain .",
    "cotunneling , which arises in the fourth order in @xmath51 , is characterized by the energy @xmath57 .",
    "finally , the energy scale of kondo effect @xmath58 characterizes the crossover from the weak coupling regime @xmath59 to the strong coupling , where @xmath57 is enhanced due to the multiple creation of low - energy electron - hole pairs in the leads in the process of cotunneling .",
    "the kondo energy also scales the excitations above the ground `` kondo - singlet '' state.@xcite the hierarchy of all these energies is @xmath60    an effective way to describe the crossover from the weak coupling to the strong coupling kondo regime is the renormalization group ( rg ) approach.@xcite in this method the renormalization of parameters @xmath61 in ( [ 2.6 ] ) in the course of reduction of the energy scale @xmath47 from high energies @xmath62 to low energies still exceeding @xmath63 is calculated .",
    "our purpose is to describe this procedure in terms of dynamical symmetries _ which change in the course of reduction of the energy scale _ @xmath47 .",
    "it was noticed that the multistage kondo screening predetermines the non - universal features of the kondo tunneling in the quantum dots with even occupation .",
    "@xcite in that case the relevant dynamical symmetry groups are @xmath64 with @xmath65.@xcite in this paper we will show that this language is useful already in the studies of the `` ordinary '' kondo effect for quantum dots with odd electron occupation @xmath66 characterized by spin 1/2 .",
    "the relevant lie groups are @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "as was mentioned above , the dynamical symmetries of confined electrons in the quantum dot @xmath56 are revealed in its interaction with the `` fermi bath '' @xmath55 of conduction electrons , the anderson hamiltonian describing the coupling between two subsystems reads @xmath69 where three terms describe the nanoobject , the fermi - bath and their coupling , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath70 in general case includes the direct coupling ( quantum tunneling of electrons between two subsystems ) , the direct interaction of coulomb and exchange nature and the indirect ( kinematic ) interaction induced by the tunneling .",
    "if the symmetry of nanoobject is well defined , the hamiltonian @xmath71 may be diagonalized by means of projection operators ( [ 2.2 ] ) , and the generators of dynamical symmetry group ( [ 2.5 ] ) arise in the interaction term @xmath70 in combination with the operators describing the excitations in the fermi bath .",
    "these symmetries can not be treated in the same way as the symmetries of the integrable systems discussed in the monographs and the references therein , because the interaction not only activates the symmetry @xmath72 of the nanoobject but also involves the charge , orbital and spin degrees of freedom of the bath .",
    "this principal difference was pointed out in refs . , where the quantum tunneling through an artificial molecule ( double quantum dot ) with even electron occupation @xmath73 in presence of the many - particle interaction of kondo type was described by means of the generators of the @xmath74 group .",
    "to take the dynamical symmetries explicitly in the calculations of excitation spectra and in the studies of spin and charge transport in nanoobject , one should adhere the following paradigm : @xcite    * when diagonalizing @xmath71 use the projection operators in accordance with eqs .",
