    "liquid - crystalline elastomers  @xcite are elastic media with the macroscopic symmetry properties of liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "they consist of weakly crosslinked polymeric networks with mesogenic units .",
    "the existence of the rubbery crosslinked network has apparently little impact on liquid crystalline phase behavior .",
    "in fact , the usual thermotropic liquid crystal phases , i.e. , the nematic , cholesteric , smectic-@xmath7 , and smectic-@xmath8 phases have their elastomeric counterparts  @xcite .",
    "however , because liquid - crystalline elastomers can not flow , they have mechanical properties that differ significantly from standard liquid crystals . usually , liquid - crystalline elastomers are prepared by crosslinking side - chain  @xcite or main - chain  @xcite polymers .",
    "alternative methods of synthesis include the polymerization of monomeric solutes in a liquid - crystalline solvent  @xcite or the confinement of a conventional liquid crystal in a dilute flexible matrix such as aerosil  @xcite .",
    "the main subject of this paper are nematic liquid - crystalline elastomers , or briefly , nematic elastomers ( nes ) . for recent reviews on nes",
    "see refs .  .",
    "these materials have unique properties that make them candidates for device applications .",
    "temperature change  @xcite or illumination  @xcite can alter the orientational order and cause the elastomer to extend or contract as much as @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this qualifies nematic elastomers as contestants for use in artificial muscles  @xcite .",
    "another striking property of nematic elastomers is their soft elasticity  @xcite characterized by vanishing shear stresses for a range of longitudinal strains applied perpendicular to the uniaxial direction .",
    "the origin of soft elasticity in nes is the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry of the isotropic state induced by the development of orientational order in the nematic state  @xcite .",
    "this spontaneous symmetry breaking has the consequence that nes are not like conventional uniaxial elastomers characterized by five independent shear moduli .",
    "rather , the elastic constant associated with shear in planes containing the anisotropy axis ( customarily called @xmath0 ) vanishes in nes .",
    "though we are primarily interested in nes , we also study a particular version of another class of soft uniaxial elastomers in which the elastic constant @xmath0 simply vanishes for energetic or entropic reasons . in this case",
    ", @xmath5 is a critical point marking the boundary between the high - symmetry uniaxial phase with @xmath6 and a low - symmetry sheared phase with @xmath10 . in other words , @xmath0 acts like the temperature variable in a standard thermal phase transition .",
    "a complete model of this critical point requires the introduction of third and fourth order terms in the nonlinear strains to stabilize the system when @xmath11 .",
    "since this complete model is characterized by a large number of parameters , it is quite complex . rather than",
    "analyze this full model , we consider simpler model systems , which we call critically soft elastomers or cses , defined by simply setting @xmath5 in the standard elastic energy of a uniaxial medium containing only quadratic terms in nonlinear strains .",
    "remarkably , cses exhibit well - defined anomalous elasticity much like that of the more physical nes even though they lack the nonlinear terms needed to stabilize their low - symmetry phase .",
    "cses are simpler in many ways than nes , and the analysis of their anomalous behavior provides a useful and instructive tutorial prelude to the analysis of nes .    on the level of mean - field theory ,",
    "the elastic energies of nes and cses coincide",
    ". therefore , their respective elastic properties are equivalent above their mutual upper critical dimension 3 . for dimensions",
    "@xmath12 , however , fluctuations become important .",
    "these fluctuations lead to grinstein - pelcovits  @xcite type renormalizations culminating in anomalous elasticity , i.e. , in a length - scale dependence of certain elastic constants , with different universality classes for nes and cses .    in the present paper",
    "we explore the anomalous elasticity of nes and cses by carrying out a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis . using the methods of renormalized field theory  @xcite we examine the scaling behavior of the elastic constants in @xmath3 as well as in @xmath13 dimensions .",
    "a brief account of our work on nes appears in ref .",
    "our work on cses has not been reported hitherto .",
    "we will treat only systems in which random stresses are not important .",
    "random stresses lead to a different universality class with anomalous behavior  @xcite below five rather than three dimensions .",

    "our simple cse model does not include higher order terms in the strain to stabilize the sheared phase .",
    "we expect , however , that the full model with these terms included will have the same structure as our cse model , at least for @xmath26 .",

    "the mass points of the equilibrium undistorted medium are labeled by their position vectors @xmath86 in @xmath1-dimensional ( reference ) space . when the medium is distorted , a mass point originally at @xmath86 is mapped to a new point @xmath87 in @xmath1-dimensional ( target ) space . since @xmath88 when there is no distortion , it is customary to introduce the phonon variable @xmath89 that measures the deviation of @xmath87 from @xmath86 .",
    "suppose for a moment the medium is distorted solely by stretching .",
    "the energy of the distorted state relative to the reference state depends on the relative amount of stretching @xmath90 , where @xmath91 with @xmath92  @xcite are the components of the familiar nonlinear lagrangian strain tensor @xmath93 .",
    "note that @xmath93 is invariant under arbitrary rotations in target space .",
    "this feature makes the lagrangian strain tensor an adequate variable for formulating elastic energies because all elastic media are rotationally invariant in target space .",
    "this invariance is easy to understand : different physical orientations of the same sample have the same energy  @xcite . as customary ,",
    "the reference state , relative to which @xmath93 is defined , is taken to be in mechanical equilibrium , and hence no terms linear in @xmath94 appear in the stretching energy .",
    "to lowest order , the stretching energy is then of the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 is an elastic constant tensor . for media isotropic in the reference space , for example",

    "in other words : cses are soft elastic materials .    for many elastic systems",
    "it is justified to neglect energetic contributions , such as bending , that are associated with higher derivatives of the displacements .",
    "that is , because bending is unimportant compared to stretching at small momenta . due to the soft elasticity , however ,",
    "the stretching energy of cses can vanish , and hence , bending is important .    for the moment",
    ", we set aside the uniaxial term proportional to @xmath0 and concentrate on the pure soft case .",

    "all other bending terms allowed by symmetry turn out to be irrelevant in the sense of the renormalization group .",
    "also , not all parts of the strains are relevant .",
    "discarding any parts of the strains that lead to irrelevant contributions to the hamiltonian , as discussed further below , leaves us with    [ truncstrains ] @xmath106 and @xmath107    in principle we could use @xmath108 as it stands in eq .",

    "we carry out a perturbation expansion in the temperature , i.e. , @xmath45 serves as our expansion parameter . as a consequence ,",
    "not only the constants and fields featured in @xmath108 but also the temperature will require renormalization .",

    "first , under a global rescaling of the coordinates @xmath119 and @xmath120 , we find a scaling invariant theory provided that @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( @xmath54 invariance ) . viewing @xmath54 as an inverse length scale , this means that the field @xmath16 has a naive dimension 1 and that the naive dimension of @xmath45 is @xmath32 .",
    "the field @xmath15 and the remaining parameters in @xmath108 have a vanishing naive dimension . above @xmath3 dimensions the naive dimension of @xmath45 is negative and @xmath45 is irrelevant whereas it is relevant below @xmath3 .",
    "hence , we identify @xmath123 as the upper critical dimension of the cse model .    at this point we take a short detour and catch up on justifying the truncation of the strains as stated in eqs .",

    "hence , they can be neglected in studying the long length scale behavior at leading order , i.e. , they are irrelevant in the sense of the rg .",
    "second , due to the anisotropy of the model , we may rescale the longitudinal coordinate alone : @xmath127 .",

    "that this transformation mixes the longitudinal and the transversal fields ( mixing invariance ) .",
    "it can be viewed as a remnant of the rotational invariance of the original theory in target space .",
    "this mixing transformation will be valuable for us because it leads to ward identities that reduce the number of vertex functions to be calculated in perturbation theory .",
    "these ward identities will be derived in appendix  [ app : ward1 ] .      in this section",
    "we determine the scaling behavior of the correlation function of the fields @xmath146 and @xmath147 by using perturbation theory augmented by renormalization group methods . as usual , we analyze vertex functions that require renormalization due to the presence of ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences in feynman diagrams",
