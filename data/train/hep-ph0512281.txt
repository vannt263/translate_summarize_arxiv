    "the results for sps1a@xmath2 presented here are based on preliminary experimental simulations and extrapolations from earlier analyses for sps1a and other reference points as a substitute of missing information necessary for a first comprehensive test of all aspects of the spa project .",
    "althought current spa studies are very encouraging , much additional work both on the theoretical as well as on the experimental side will be needed to achieve the spa goals .",
    "in particular    * the present level of theoretical calculations still does not match the expected experimental precision , particularly in coherent lhc+ilc analyses .",
    "new efforts in higher - order susy calculations are necessary for the interpretation of experimental analyses .",
    "* there is no complete proof that @xmath4 scheme preserves supersymmetry and gauge invariance in all cases . as the precision of susy calculations is pushed to higher orders , the spa project also requires an improved understanding of the @xmath4 scheme .",
    "recently it has been shown that for massive final state particles spurious density functions for the @xmath28 gluon components have to be introduced to comply with the factorization theorem  @xcite which opens a way to formulating an efficient combination of the most attractive elements of @xmath4 and @xmath13 schemes in describing hadronic processes . *",
    "a limited set of observables included in experimental analyses by no means exhausts the opportunities which data at lhc and at ilc are expected to provide in the future .",
    "likewise , in most analyses errors are purely experimental and do not include the theoretical counterpart which must be improved considerably before matching the experimental standards .",
    "this is particularly important for the coherent combination of future data obtained at lhc and ilc .",
    "feedback and coherently combined analyses , which will greatly benefit from a concurrent running of both colliders , are indispensable for a meaningful reconstruction of the underlying theory  @xcite . * astrophysical data",
    "play an increasingly important role in confronting supersymmetry with experiments .",
    "models with r - parity conservation predict a stable weakly interacting , massive particle . in this case on the one hand their relic abundance imposes crucial limits on supersymmetric scenarios and specific requirements on the accuracies must be achieved when the cdm particle is studied in high - energy physics laboratory experiments  @xcite . on the other , predictions based on the comprehensive parameter analysis of high - energy experiments determine the cross sections for astrophysical scattering experiments by which the nature of the cold dark matter particles can be established .",
    "for example , a study of the sps1a point at lhc , based on very large statistics @xcite , indicates that the relic density can be determined to @xmath29% for the sps1a@xmath2 scenario . at the ilc",
    "a precision of @xmath30% should be achievable . *",
    "the parameter set sps1a@xmath2 chosen for a first study provides a benchmark for developing and testing the tools needed for a successful analysis of future susy data .",
    "however , neither this specific point nor the mssm itself may be the correct model for low - scale susy . while versions of msugra and of gaugino mediation have also been analyzed in some detail , the analyses have to be extended systematically to other possibilities .",
    "in particular , cp violation , r - parity violation , flavor violation , nmssm and extended gauge groups are among scenarios which might be realised in the susy sector .",
    "the spa conventions are general enough to cover all these scenarios .",
    "the spa project , a joint theoretical and experimental effort , aims at providing + @xmath1 a well defined framework for susy calculations and data analyses , + @xmath1 all necessary theoretical and computational tools , + @xmath1 a testground scenario sps1a@xmath2 , + @xmath1 a platform for future extensions and developments .",
    "+ first results for the reference point spa1a@xmath2 are very encouraging , however it is clear that much work is still needed on the experimental and theoretical sides to achieve the desired level of accuracy .",
    "the spa project is a dynamical system expected to evolve continuously and to encompass more general supersymmetry scanarios .",
