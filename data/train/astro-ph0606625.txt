    "three or four decades ago , globular cluster ( gc ) formation was thought by many to be a phenomenon occurring only in the early universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in the meantime ,",
    "young , compact star clusters with masses in the range @xmath6@xmath7 m@xmath8 have been found in many different galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and there is a growing concensus that these `` young massive clusters '' ( ymcs ) may well be young analogues of the old gcs associated almost universally with the spheroidal components of galaxies . by implication ,",
    "gcs have become potentially interesting not just as fossil left - overs from the early universe , but more generally as test particles for studies of extragalactic stellar populations .    in keeping with this spirit , contemporary observing proposals or papers on gcs often include an introductory remark along the lines of : _",
    "`` gcs are thought to be good tracers of the major star forming episodes in their host galaxies''_. ymcs / gcs may indeed trace star formation quite generally , but it is also clear that some caution must be exercised . for example , the number of gcs per field star varies from galaxy to galaxy ( the classical `` specific frequency problem '' ) , as well as between stellar populations within galaxies @xcite .",
    "this must be due to differences in the formation efficiency of gcs relative to field stars , in the gc survival rates , or ( more likely ) some combination of the two .",
    "of the roughly 150 catalogued gcs in our own galaxy @xcite , about 2/3 are associated chemically , spatially and kinematically with the halo , while this is true for only @xmath9% of the stars .",
    "conversely , some 90% of the stellar mass resides in the thin disk of our galaxy , while no gcs are currently known to be associated with this component . even though some quite massive clusters might be located in remote parts of the galactic disk @xcite , a simple scaling by stellar mass of the gcs in the bulge or halo would predict hundreds or thousands of gcs in the disk , seemingly at odds with the observations .",
    "all this is of course well known , and is the reason why gcs are often assumed to trace only `` _ _ major _ _ star forming episodes '' .",
    "the problem then remains to define when a star forming episode qualifies as `` major '' .",
    "perhaps gcs mainly trace spheroid formation @xcite , but some stars currently residing in spheroids may originally have formed in disks . as an example , it is illustrative to consider the outcome of merging two milky way galaxies : the merger product would contain about 200 metal - poor and 100 metal - rich pre - existing gcs from the progenitor galaxies , assuming no gcs are destroyed .",
    "the current gas mass in the milky way is about @xmath10 m@xmath8 @xcite , which is about half the mass of the bulge . assuming that the merger would form gcs with the same efficiency as the bulge , using all the available gas , about 50 new metal - rich gcs would form ( and survive ) .",
    "the resulting gc population would then consist of three major sub - components : metal - poor , old gcs originating in the progenitor galaxy halos , moderately metal - rich gcs from the pre - existing bulges , and very metal - rich gcs formed in the merger .",
    "the estimate of the number of new gcs is obviously very crude .",
    "however , the main point here is that while the majority of the _ stars _ in the resulting spheroid ( about 90% ) would have formed in the disks already before the merger took place , their formation history might not be reflected in the gc system .",
    "mergers at higher @xmath11 were likely more gas - rich , and the discrepancy between the star- and gc formation histories may have been less extreme than in the example outlined above . nevertheless , since gcs play such an important role in attempts to constrain the star formation histories of early - type galaxies , there is a clear need to also quantify the limitations better .",
    "in order to understand the differences between properties of star cluster populations in different galaxies better , it is useful to divide the problem into three sub - problems which can , to a large extent , be addressed separately : 1 ) understanding the _ cluster ( initial ) mass function _ ( cimf )  is it universal , or do some parameters ( e.g.  the slope or upper mass limit ) vary as a function of external parameters ( star formation rate , gas pressure / density ) ?",
    "2 ) the cluster _ formation efficiency _ relative to `` field '' stars : again , how does this depend on external factors ?",
    "3 ) _ disruption effects : _ these are driven both by internal mechanisms ( two - body relaxation , binaries , black holes ) and external factors ( shocks , interactions with giant molecular clouds , tidal fields ) . however , it is a hard problem and progress has been slow in making reliable , quantitative predictions for the time scales involved , at least until very recently .    in the following i will concentrate mainly on the first item in the list , with only a few remarks about formation efficiencies .",
    "disruption effects are covered elsewhere in this volume ( e.g.  baumgardt , de marchi , vesperini ) .",
    "the number of galaxies with reliable constraints on the cimf remains small .",
    "probably the best - known example is the antennae , where the cimf appears well approximated by a power - law @xmath12 with @xmath13 over the range @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "similar mass functions have been found in m51 @xcite , ngc  3310 and ngc  6745 @xcite , the milky way @xcite and in the lmc @xcite , although not all studies cover the same mass range .",
    "it seems reasonable to conclude that star clusters typically form with a mass spectrum that can be well approximated by a uniform power - law over some mass range .",
    "it should be mentioned that some dwarf galaxies contain a few clusters which are much brighter than one would expect from the total number of star clusters in those galaxies @xcite . here",
    ", however , i mainly focus on the opposite problem , i.e.  whether there might be a _ truncation _ of the cimf at some upper mass @xmath15 , thus inhibiting efficient formation of clusters above a certain mass limit ( @xmath15 ) under certain circumstances ( e.g.  in the milky way disk today ) .      starting again with the milky way , it is interesting to consider the consequences of postulating that young clusters are drawn purely at random from a power - law distribution with @xmath16 . the current star formation rate in bound star clusters in the solar neighbourhood",
    "is estimated to be around @xmath17 m@xmath2 yr@xmath18 pc@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "assuming for simplicity a constant cluster formation rate in the galactic disk over the past 10 gyrs and that the cluster formation rate in the solar neighbourhood is representative for the disk as a whole , this corresponds to @xmath20 m@xmath2 formed in bound clusters within the solar circle ( 8.5 kpc ) .",
    "this is most likely a conservative estimate and the true number may well be significantly higher . sampling these clusters from a power - law cimf for @xmath21 ,",
    "one predicts a total of close to @xmath22 clusters formed over the lifetime of the disk , of which 9000 , 900 and 80 have @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these numbers do not depend strongly on the adopted upper and lower integration limits , although they do depend on the cimf slope ",
    "a steeper slope implies a more bottom - heavy cimf , with fewer high - mass clusters .",
    "there are two consistency checks worth making : first , the stellar mass of the milky way bulge is about 10% of that of the disk .",
    "if clusters formed with the same efficiency in the bulge as they do in the disk now , one might expect about 90 clusters with @xmath24 in the bulge , of which 8 have @xmath25 .",
    "the actual observed numbers of gcs in the bulge are smaller by a factor of 4 , which may be partly due to disruption effects . however , there is no indication that clusters formed with a _ higher _ efficiency in the bulge , and the number of gcs observed in the bulge may be roughly consistent with a formation efficiency ( relative to field stars ) similar to that observed today in the galactic disk .",
    "the numbers for the halo are more difficult to reconcile with this picture , since the halo has about twice as many gcs as the bulge but an order of magnitude fewer stars .",
    "this suggests a higher formation efficiency of metal - poor halo gcs , consistent with observations of early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "the distinction between _ halo _ ( metal - poor ) gcs and all other star clusters may be more fundamental than the one between old gcs in general and present - day star formation .",
    "note that these arguments are slightly different from those of mclaughlin @xcite who argued for a universal cluster formation efficiency relative to the total available _ gas _ mass .",
    "second , we can compare with the number of massive star clusters actually observed in the disk . by construction",
    ", the current formation rate agrees with the number of low - mass clusters ( @xmath26 m@xmath2 ) observed locally , but it is interesting to see what happens when extrapolating to higher masses .",
    "recently , at least two young clusters with masses in the range @xmath6@xmath27 m@xmath2 and ages @xmath28 years have been identified @xcite .",
    "if they are taken as representative of the formation rate of such objects within a distance of 5 kpc , this corresponds to 2 kpc@xmath19 gyr@xmath18 , or 4500 such clusters formed within the solar circle over 10 gyrs .",
    "again , this is roughly consistent with the order - of - magnitude estimates above ( in fact , 8000 clusters with @xmath29 are predicted ) , suggesting that clusters like westerlund 1 with masses up to about @xmath27 m@xmath2 occur naturally ( albeit rarely ) as part of the normal hierarchy of star formation in the milky way disk today .",
    "a typical disruption time for a cluster with mass @xmath30 in the solar neighbourhood is @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "assuming that this scaling remains valid for @xmath32 m@xmath2 , a cluster with an initial mass of @xmath27 m@xmath2 is expected to disrupt in about 5 gyrs while a @xmath7 m@xmath2 cluster has a lifetime well in excess of a hubble time .",
    "the disk should then contain about 500 clusters with masses greater than @xmath27 m@xmath2 and still virtually all of the 80 clusters with @xmath33 m@xmath2 formed over its lifetime . of these objects , 7 should be found within a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "this estimate makes the crude assumption that clusters disrupt instantaneously , while in practice mass is lost at a nearly constant rate over the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "although current catalogs of milky way open clusters are highly incomplete beyond 1 kpc , it seems unlikely that a large population of clusters with masses in the range @xmath27@xmath7 m@xmath2 could have been missed .",
    "it appears plausible that the cimf in the milky way is truncated somewhere in the vicinity of @xmath27 m@xmath2 , or at least becomes much steeper than a power - law with a slope of @xmath34 .",
    "however , it would be highly desirable to quantify better the completeness of current cluster surveys in the disk out to large distances ( several kpc ) .      studies of the cimf in external galaxies are complicated by the rapid change in mass - to - light ratio that characterizes simple stellar populations . observed luminosities can not be converted to masses unless the age of each individual cluster is known with some accuracy , which generally requires u - band imaging .",
    "several studies have shown that the _ luminosity _ function of young star clusters generally appears to be sampled all the way up to its statistical upper limit @xcite .",
    "even the scatter around the predicted relation is consistent with random sampling @xcite .",
    "no direct evidence for truncation of the lf has been found so far , suggesting that most large galaxies are physically able to form star clusters with masses _ at least _",
    "up to about @xmath27 m@xmath2 .",
    "distribution for a simulated cluster population with @xmath35 clusters and 6@xmath36log(age / yr)@xmath369 . hashed and outlined histograms are for mass distributions truncated at @xmath27 m@xmath2 and @xmath37 m@xmath2.,width=415 ]    in general , there is no straight - forward way to infer the mass function of a cluster sample from the observed luminosity function @xcite . only in the special case where the mf is a simple , untruncated power - law , or",
    "the age distribution is a delta function , will the lf and mf have the same shape .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] , which compares the mass- and luminosity functions for simulated cluster samples with power - law mass functions truncated at @xmath37 m@xmath2 and @xmath27 m@xmath2 .",
    "the clusters were assigned random ages uniformly distributed between @xmath7 years and @xmath38 years and masses were converted to @xmath39 magnitudes using ssp models @xcite .",
    "mass loss and cluster disruption were ignored . in the left - hand panel ,",
    "the mf truncation occurs as a simple cut - off , while in the lf ( right ) the mass cut results in a steepening of the slope at the bright end rather than any distinct cut - off in luminosity . for a real cluster population , the maximum mass may be inferred from the `` bend '' that occurs at @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] , assuming that the mf is a power - law up to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "such a bend has been observed in the antennae and m51 , where it may be explained by a mf truncated near @xmath4 m@xmath2 and @xmath3 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , in still more active galaxies such as arp 220 , ngc  7252 and ngc  1316 , there are clusters with masses as high as @xmath5 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the behaviour of the following quantities as a function of the total number of clusters ( @xmath41 ) in a population with a truncation at an upper mass limit @xmath15 : 1 ) the maximum mass @xmath42 occurring in the population , 2 ) the mass of the brightest cluster @xmath43 , and 3 ) the magnitude of the brightest cluster , @xmath44 . if @xmath41 clusters are sampled at random from a power - law @xmath45 with lower mass limit @xmath46 , then statistically the most massive cluster will have @xmath47 @xcite . from monte - carlo simulations of various cluster formation histories , weidner et al .",
    "@xcite found that when clusters are sampled at random from a power - law mf , the most massive cluster is also the brightest in about 95% of the cases .",
    "if the mass function has a real physical upper limit , this is not necessarily the case .    the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvn ] shows the results of monte - carlo simulations for @xmath42 and @xmath43 in cluster samples with various @xmath15 limits .",
    "clusters were drawn at random from the same population used in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] , truncated at @xmath15 values between @xmath6 m@xmath8 and @xmath48 m@xmath8 .",
    "the median values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 in 1000 experiments are shown with solid and dashed lines as a function of the number of clusters sampled .",
    "the relation predicted by pure sampling statistics is indicated as a dotted line . for small @xmath41 and large @xmath15 ,",
    "the truncation of the mf is not `` felt '' and the @xmath42 and @xmath43 vs.  @xmath41 relations approach the curve for random sampling , i.e.  the weidner et al .",
    "result is reproduced .",
    "conversely , for small @xmath15 and large @xmath41 , statistical effects become unimportant and @xmath49 . in between these extremes there is a regime where the mass function is likely to be sampled up to higher masses than the luminosity function , or @xmath50 .",
    "this turns out to be the situation encountered in many real galaxies .     and",
    "@xmath15.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]   and @xmath15.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]    for both @xmath42 and @xmath43 , fig .",
    "[ fig : mvn ] shows a fairly rapid transition between the regimes where size - of - sample effects and truncation dominate .",
    "thus , it might seem that the observed strong relation between total number of clusters in galaxies and the luminosity of the brightest cluster @xcite is incompatible with truncation of the cimf playing any important role .",
    "however , as shown in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mvn ] , @xmath44 has a steep dependency on @xmath41 over a much wider range in @xmath41 than @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this is because the mean _ age _ of the brightest cluster shifts towards younger ages for higher @xmath41 , as it becomes increasingly likely to encounter a cluster with mass near @xmath15 in the brief phase where the m / l ratio is very low .    from the preceding discussion",
    "it should be clear that the lf can be dominated by sampling effects , even if the mf does have a physical truncation .",
    "for example , for @xmath51 m@xmath8 , the @xmath42 curve starts to flatten at @xmath52 , implying that the mf would be sampled up to its physical upper limit already in a relatively cluster - poor galaxy .",
    "the @xmath44 curve , on the other hand , would continue to rise beyond @xmath53 , corresponding roughly to a milky way - sized galaxy ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : mw ] ) .",
    "the key to detecting a physical upper limit of the cimf will be to cover a dynamic range large enough to study the lf in detail and detect signatures such as the `` bend '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : histo ] .",
    "ultimately , however , inferences about the mf based on the lf remain indirect and dependent on assumptions about the shape of the mf , star formation history etc . , and ideally it would be desirable to have direct information about the mass functions in several more galaxies .",
    "several such studies are now underway , and may provide important insight into the mf in the not too distant future .",
    "while research in extragalactic star clusters remains a very active field , we are still facing a number of important questions .",
    "the ubiquity of ymcs in external galaxies is now well established , but the apparent absence of a large population of clusters with masses in the range @xmath27@xmath7 m@xmath2 in the galactic disk remains somewhat of a puzzle .",
    "this may suggest an upper limit to the cimf near @xmath27 m@xmath2 in the milky way , as noted already by van den bergh & lafontaine @xcite , although studies of disk clusters are still hampered by our own location close to the galactic plane .",
    "however , the recent realization that the milky way is still forming clusters with masses near @xmath27 m@xmath2 hints that the cimf in the milky way may not be very different from that in the lmc , the main difference being that the census of ymcs is more complete in the lmc . there is some evidence for truncation at a somewhat higher mass in m51 ( @xmath3 m@xmath2 ) and the antennae ( @xmath54 m@xmath2 ) , while arp 220 , ngc  1316 and ngc  7252 host clusters as massive as @xmath5 m@xmath2 .",
    "these galaxies also define a sequence of increasing star formation rate , suggesting that galaxies with higher sfrs are physically able to form more massive clusters .",
    "this may provide a hint as to why gc formation was common at high @xmath11 , when sfrs and gas densities were generally higher .",
