    "in dense wireless networks , the dense bs deployment brings the network closer to mobile users and thus can significantly improve spectral efficiency per unit area .",
    "for instance , the capacity of dense wireless networks scales linearly with the number of bss @xmath0 if all bss are equipped with wired payload backhauls . however , there are also two key technical challenges : the _ interference _ and the _ _ backhaul cost issue__s .    compared to traditional cellular networks ,",
    "the interference in dense wireless networks is more severe due to the increased bs density .",
    "recently , some advanced interference mitigation schemes such as cooperative mimo ( co - mimo ) @xcite have been proposed . by sharing both channel state information ( csi ) and payload data among the concerned bss",
    ", the co - mimo can transform the wireless network from an unfavorable interference topology to a favorable broadcast topology , where the interference can be mitigated much more efficiently .",
    "however , the co - mimo technique requires high capacity backhaul for payload exchange between bss , which is a cost bottleneck in dense wireless networks .",
    "moreover , a dense wireless network with all small bss having wired payload backhauls suffers from high capex and opex @xcite . to address this issue ,",
    "a more flexible backhaul solution has been proposed where only a fraction of @xmath1 bss have wired payload backhauls , and the other bss are connected to the core network via low - cost wireless backhauls @xcite . however , in this case , the performance is limited by the number of wired payload backhauls @xmath2 and the total network capacity can only scale as @xmath3",
    ".    this paper addresses the following fundamental questions in dense wireless networks .",
    "can we realize the benefit of mimo cooperation without wired backhaul connections between the bss ?",
    "can we achieve linear capacity scaling with only @xmath1 wired payload backhauls ? according to classical information theory , where the information is considered as random raw bits , the answers to these questions are negative .",
    "however , in practice , we are more concerned about delivering content . by exploiting the fact that content is cachable ,",
    "we show that the answers to both questions can be positive using _ phy caching _ at the bss . specifically , there are two fundamental benefits associated with phy caching in dense wireless networks .",
    "if the content accessed by users exists simultaneously at the bs caches , the bss can engage in co - mimo and enjoy a large mimo cooperation gain , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_model ] for the red and green data flows .",
    "this is referred to as _ cache - induced opportunistic co - mimo_. if the content requested by a user is distributed in the caches of the nearby bss , this user can directly obtain the requested content from the nearby bss , which reduces the number of hops from the source bss to the destination user , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : system_model ] for the purple data flow .",
    "this is referred to as _ cache - assisted multihopping_.    we are interested in studying the fundamental linear capacity scaling in the backhaul - limited c - dwn and how to exploit the above benefits of phy caching to achieve the linear capacity scaling .",
    "some related works are reviewed below .    * capacity scaling law in wireless ad hoc networks : * the capacity scaling law of wireless ad hoc networks was first studied by gupta and kumar in the seminal paper @xcite , where they showed that in a large wireless ad hoc networks with @xmath0 random located nodes , the aggregate throughput of classical multihop communication scheme scales at most as @xmath4 . after that , a number of works @xcite have studied the information theoretic capacity scaling law under different channel models and traffic models .",
    "specifically , it was shown in @xcite that under a physical channel model with the path loss exponent @xmath5 $ ] , the total network capacity scales as @xmath6 , which can approach the linear capacity scaling law @xmath7 as @xmath8 approaches @xmath9",
    ". however , this capacity gain is at the cost of increased system complexity due to the complicated _ hierarchical mimo cooperation _ @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors studied the capacity scaling in ad hoc networks with arbitrary node placement .",
    "the capacity regions of the ad hoc network with more complicated unicast or multicast traffic model have been studied in @xcite .",
    "* capacity scaling law in cellular networks : * unlike ad hoc networks , cellular networks consist of infrastructure gateways as the sources of data traffics .",
    "when all bss have wired payload backhauls , the capacity scales linearly with the number of the bss .",
    "however , adding more _ backhaul - connected bss _",
    "( i.e. , bss that have wired backhauls ) leads to high capex and opex @xcite .",
    "a more cost - effective way to enhance the capacity is to add relay nodes to enable multihop communications between the users and bss .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that multihop cellular networks with @xmath0 relay nodes and @xmath10 bss achieve higher per - node throughput than pure cellular networks ( with only @xmath10 bss ) by a scaling factor of @xmath11 . however , the total capacity order @xmath12 is still far from the linear capacity @xmath7 for large @xmath0 .    * wireless caching : * recently , wireless caching has been proposed as a cost - effective solution to handle the high traffic rate caused by content delivery applications @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed coded caching schemes that can create coded multicast opportunities .",
    "a proactive caching paradigm was proposed in @xcite to exploit both the spatial and social structure of the wireless networks .",
    "the fundamental tradeoff in wireless d2d caching networks have also been studied in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite studied the joint optimization of cache content replication and routing in a _ regular network _ and identified the throughput scaling laws for various regimes . note that",
    "although both @xcite and this paper focus on the scaling law of cached wireless networks , they are different in many aspects .",
    "first , the throughput scaling law in @xcite is obtained by assuming a specific caching and multihop transmission scheme .",
    "on the other hand , the capacity scaling law studied in this paper is an information theoretic scaling law which does not depend on any specific caching or phy transmission scheme .",
    "second , the role of caching is also different . in @xcite , the main role of caching",
    "is to reduce the number of hops in multihop transmissions . in this paper , the role of phy caching includes both the _ cache - assisted multihopping _ and the _ cache - induced mimo cooperation_. third , the network topologies are also different . @xcite considered a regular network where all nodes are placed on a perfect grid and have homogeneous traffic .",
    "this paper considers a general network with arbitrary node placements and content requests .",
    "finally , the key difference between wireless and wired networks is that the performance of wireless networks is fundamentally limited by the interference due to the broadcast nature of wireless channel .",
    "however , this unique feature of wireless networks and the associated phy transmission scheme are not considered in the analysis in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider joint design of phy caching and transmission schemes ( e.g. , the phy transmission modes in our design depend on the cache mode of the requested file ) where interference plays a vital role ( e.g. , both frequency partitioning and cache - induced mimo cooperation are proposed to mitigate the interference ) .",
    "the above works on wireless caching do not consider cache - induced mimo cooperation among the bss .",
    "the concept of cached - induced opportunistic co - mimo was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the achievable throughput scaling laws of ad hoc networks with phy caching were also studied in @xcite .",
    "however , the capacity scaling in the backhaul - limited c - dwn and the corresponding order - optimal phy caching and transmission schemes have not been addressed in the literature .",
    "this paper provides solutions to the following important questions associated with the backhaul - limited c - dwn .    * * how much cache is needed to achieve the linear capacity scaling in the backhaul - limited c - dwn ? * we show that * * the total network capacity of the backhaul - limited c - dwn scales as @xmath7 when the bs cache size is larger than a threshold that depends on the content popularity distribution .",
    "we quantify the minimum bs cache size required to achieve the linear capacity scaling as a function of the content popularity parameter .",
    "* * what is the order - optimal capacity achieving scheme ? *",
    "we propose an order - optimal achievable scheme , which can exploit both the _ _ cache - induced opportunistic co - mimo and cache - assisted multihopping to achieve the linear capacity scaling for the backhaul - limited c - dwn . *",
    "* what is the role of cache - induced co - mimo ? * exploiting cache - induced co - mimo can not change the throughput scaling law of the backhaul limited c - dwn .",
    "however , it helps to mitigate the interference and increase the spatial degrees of freedom ( i.e. , the number of data streams that can be simultaneously transmitted ) in the backhaul limited c - dwn . as a result , a huge throughput gain can be achieved by exploiting cache - induced co - mimo . in this paper , we derive closed - form expression for this cache - induced mimo cooperation gain and analyze the minimum bs cache size needed to achieve a significant cache - induced mimo cooperation gain .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : system - model ] , we introduce the system model . in section [ sec : uncached - wireless - network ] , we give some preliminary results on capacity bound in backhaul - limited dense wireless networks without cache . in section [ sec : capacity - scaling - law ] , we present the main results on the linear capacity scaling law in the backhaul - limited c - dwn .",
