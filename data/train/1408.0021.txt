    "the spin resonance , observed by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments first in the cuprates@xcite and then in heavy - fermion  @xcite and fe - based superconductors ( fescs)@xcite , has been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental studies over the past decade using both metallic  @xcite and near - localized strong - coupling scenarios  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the theoretical interpretations of the resonance can be broadly split into two classes .",
    "the first class of theories assumes that the spin resonance is a magnon , overdamped in the normal state due to the strong decay into low - energy particle - hole pairs , but emerging prominently in the superconducting state due to reduction of scattering at low energies  @xcite . in this line of reasoning",
    "the resonance energy @xmath8 is the magnon energy and as such it is uncorrelated with the superconducting gap @xmath9 .",
    "however , the decay of magnons into particle - hole pairs is only suppressed at energies below @xmath3 , hence the magnons become sharp in a superconductor only if their energy is below @xmath3 .",
    "the symmetry of the superconducting state does not play a crucial role here .",
    "it is only relevant that the superconducting gap is finite at the fermi surface ( fs ) points connected by the gap momentum @xmath4 .",
    "theories from the second class assume that the resonance does not exist in the normal state and emerges in the superconducting state as a feedback effect from superconductivity , like e.g. , the anderson - bogolyubov mode in the case of a charge neutral single condensate component , a leggett mode in the case of several gap components , a wave - like excitation of a spin - triplet order parameter , or a pair vibration mode in the case of a gap parameter possessing internal structure  @xcite .",
    "these `` feedback '' theories can be further split into three sub - classes . in the first the resonance",
    "is viewed as a spin - exciton , i.e. , the pole in the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath10 dressed by multiple particle - hole bubbles  @xcite .",
    "such @xmath10 can be obtained by using a computational scheme based on the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "it was argued that , if the superconducting gap changes sign between fs points connected by @xmath4 , the residual attraction pulls the resonance frequency to @xmath11 , where the decay into particle - hole pairs is reduced below @xmath12 and vanishes at @xmath13 . as a result , at @xmath13 , @xmath14 has a @xmath15functional peak at @xmath8 . in this respect ,",
    "if the resonance is an exciton , its existence necessary implies that the superconducting gap changes sign either between patches of the fs connected by @xmath4 or between different fermi pockets again connected by @xmath4 .",
    "the role of the resonance in allowing to determine the structure of the gap in a number of different superconductors has been highlighted in @xcite .",
    "theories of the second subclass explore the fact that in a superconductor the particle - hole and particle - particle channels are mixed and argue that the strongest resonance is in the particle - particle channel and the measurements of the spin susceptibility just reflect the `` leakage '' of this resonance into the particle - hole channel .",
    "the corresponding resonance has been labeled as the @xmath16-exciton @xcite , where the @xmath16 boson is a particle - particle excitation with total momentum @xmath4 ( a `` pair density - wave '' in modern nomenclature  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , theories of the third class explore the possibility that the resonance emerges due to coupling between fluctuations in particle - hole and particle - particle channel . within rpa",
    ", such resonance is due to non - diagonal terms in the generalized rpa which includes both particle - hole and particle - particle bubbles .",
    "it was called a plasmon  @xcite to stress the analogy with collective excitations in an electronic liquid .    the interplay between the `` damped spin - wave '' scenarios , the spin - exciton @xmath6resonance , and",
    "the plasmon scenarios for 2d high-@xmath12 cuprates has been studied in detail in the past decade .",
    "the outcome is that near and above optimal doping the resonance is best described as a spin - exciton , with relatively weak corrections from coupling to the particle - particle channel@xcite , while in the underdoped regime , where superconductivity emerges from a pre - existing pseudogap phase , both spin - exciton and spin - wave scenarios have been argued to account for the neutron resonance  @xcite .",
    "the situation is more complicated in 3d heavy - fermion systems  @xcite because there the excitonic resonance has a finite width even at @xmath13 if the locus of fs points separated by @xmath4 intersects a line of gap nodes .    in this work",
    "we discuss the interplay between spin - exciton , @xmath6resonance , and plasmon scenarios in fescs .",
    "previous studies of the resonance in fescs @xcite focused only on the response in the particle - hole ( spin - exciton ) channel and neglected the coupling between particle - hole and particle - particle channels .",
    "our goal is to analyze the effect of such coupling .",
    "as we said , the resonance peak has been observed below @xmath12 in several families of fescs@xcite .",
    "the spin response above @xmath12 in fescs is rather featureless away from small doping , which implies that the magnetic excitations in the normal state are highly overdamped and do nt behave as damped spin waves .",
    "the full analysis of the spin resonance in fescs is rather involved as these systems are multi - band materials with four or five fss , on which the superconducting gap has different amplitudes and phases .",
    "still , the basic conditions for spin - excitonic resonance are the same as in the cuprates and heavy fermion materials : namely , the resonance emerges at momentum @xmath4 if the superconducting gap changes sign between fs points connected by @xmath4 .",
    "this condition holds if the superconducting gap has @xmath2 symmetry , as most researchers believe , and changes sign between at least some hole and electron pockets .",
    "an alternative scenario  @xcite , which we will not discuss in this paper is that the superconducting state has a conventional , sign - preserving @xmath17 symmetry , and the observed neutron peak is not a resonance but rather a hump at frequencies slightly above @xmath3 .    in fescs",
    "that contain both hole and electron pockets , the resonance has been observed at momenta around @xmath1 , which is roughly the distance between hole and electron pockets in the actual ( folded ) brillouin zone . to account for the resonance and , at the same time , avoid unnecessary complications",
    ", we consider a minimal three - band model ( one hole pocket and two electron pockets ) , and neglect the angular dependence of the interactions along the fss . including",
    "this dependence and additional hole pockets will complicate the analysis but we do nt expect it to lead to any qualitative changes to our results .    we find that for repulsive density - density and pair - hopping interactions , the resonance peak is , to a good accuracy , a spin - exciton",
    ". the @xmath6resonance does not develop on its own , and the coupling between the resonant spin - exciton channel and the non - resonant @xmath6channel only slightly shifts the energy of the excitonic resonance .",
    "we also considered the case ( less justified microscopically ) when the interaction in the @xmath16 channel is attractive , such that both spin - exciton and @xmath16 resonance develop on their own at frequencies below @xmath3 .",
    "one could expect in this situation that the full dynamical spin susceptibility has two peaks .",
    "we found , however , that this happens only if we make the coupling between particle - hole and particle - particle channels artificially small .",
    "when we restored the original coupling , we found , in general , only one peak below @xmath3 .",
    "the peak is a mixture of a spin - exciton and @xmath16-resonance and at least in some range of system parameters its energy is smaller than that of a spin - exciton and a @xmath16-resonance .",
    "this implies that , when both channels are attractive , the coupling between the two plays a substantial role in determining the position of the true resonance which can , at least partly , be viewed as a plasmon . a somewhat similar result has been obtained earlier for the cuprates  @xcite . for some system parameters we did find two peaks in @xmath7 , but for one of them @xmath18 has wrong sign .",
    "we verified that this indicates that for such parameters the system is unstable either against condensation of @xmath16 excitations ( i.e. , against superconductivity at momentum @xmath4 ) , or against the development of sdw order in co - existence with superconductivity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we consider the model . in sec .",
    "[ chi_rpa ] we obtain the dynamical spin susceptibility within the generalized rpa scheme , which includes the coupling between particle - hole and particle - particle channels . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we analyze the profile of @xmath19 first for purely repulsive density - density and pair - hopping interactions , and then for the case when we allow the density - density interaction to become attractive .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "the fescs are multiband metals with two or three hole fs pockets centered around the @xmath20 point @xmath21 and two elliptical electron pockets centered at @xmath22 in the folded bz with two iron atoms per unit cell .",
    "the electron pockets are elliptical and related by symmetry , while the hole pockets are @xmath23-symmetric , but generally differ in size .",
    "since we are only interested in studying the role of the particle - particle channel in the spin response function , for which the non - equivalence between hole pockets is not essential , we consider the case of two hole pockets and assume that they are circular and identical , and also neglect the ellipticity of electron pockets . under these assumptions",
    "our model reduces effectively to only one hole pocket ( @xmath24 fermions ) and one electron pocket ( @xmath25 fermions ) .",
    "the fact that there are actually two hole and two electron pockets only adds up combinatoric factors .",
    "the free part of the hamiltonian is @xmath26 where @xmath27    we do not study here how superconductivity develops from interactions , as that work has been done elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "instead , we simply assume that the system reaches a superconducting state with @xmath2 symmetry before it becomes unstable towards magnetism and take the superconducting gaps as inputs . in this state ,",
    "the free part of the hamiltonian is @xmath28 where the dispersions are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "now we consider interactions that contribute to the spin susceptibility .",
    "they consist of a density - density interband interaction @xmath32 and a correlated interband hopping @xmath33 .",
    "intraband repulsion only affects the chemical potentials but does not otherwise contribute to the spin susceptibility .",
    "interband exchange in principle contributes in the @xmath16 channel but in renormalization group analysis it flows to small values@xcite . in general ,",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 depend on the angle in momentum space via coherence factors associated with the transformation from the orbital to the band basis  @xcite .",
    "however , this complication is not essential for our purposes and we take both interactions to be momentum independent .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath34,\\sigma \\neq \\sigma ^{\\prime } } c_{\\mathbf{p}_1\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } f_{\\mathbf{p}_2\\sigma ^{\\prime } } ^{\\dagger } f_{\\mathbf{p}_3\\sigma ^{\\prime } } c_{\\mathbf{p}_4\\sigma } \\nonumber\\\\ & + u_{3}\\sum_{[1234],\\sigma \\neq \\sigma ^{\\prime } } \\left ( c_{\\mathbf{p}_1\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } c_{\\mathbf{p}_2\\sigma ^{\\prime } } ^{\\dagger } f_{\\mathbf{p}_3\\sigma ^{\\prime } } f_{\\mathbf{p}_4\\sigma } + \\mathrm{h.c.}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\]]where the sum over momenta obeys momentum conservation as usual ( @xmath35 ) .    because the interactions in the band basis are linear combinations of hubbard and hund interactions in the orbital basis , weighted with orbital coherence factors , the sign of @xmath32 and @xmath33 depends on the interplay between intra - orbital and inter - orbital interactions  @xcite .",
    "the interaction @xmath33 contributes to the superconducting channel , and for an @xmath2 gap structure must be repulsive .",
    "the sign of @xmath32 is a priori unknown . in most microscopic studies it comes out positive ( repulsive ) , but in principle it can also be negative ( attractive ) .",
    "we do not assume a particular sign of @xmath32 and consider first a case where @xmath32 is positive and then when it is negative .",
    "for the first case we show that a resonance can only originate from the particle - hole channel .",
    "for negative @xmath32 the @xmath16 channel can produce collective modes as well , and we show that in general the resonant mode is a mix between spin exciton and a @xmath16-resonance .",

    "an @xmath2 gap , raman bubbles from hole and electron pocket have the same vertex structure but differ in the sign of the anomalous green s function , hence the two contributions to cross - susceptibility have opposite signs , resulting in a cancellation that is complete in the case of perfect nesting and near - complete in the case of one circular and one elliptical pocket .",

    "<S> the spin resonance observed in the inelastic neutron scattering data on fe - based superconductors has played a prominent role in the quest for determining the symmetry of the order parameter in these compounds . </S>",
    "<S> most theoretical studies of the resonance employ an rpa - type approach in the particle - hole channel and associate the resonance in the spin susceptibility @xmath0 at momentum @xmath1 with the spin - exciton of an @xmath2 superconductor , pulled below @xmath3 by residual attraction associated with the sign change of the gap between fermi points connected by @xmath4 . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore the effect of fluctuations in the particle - particle channel on the spin resonance . </S>",
    "<S> particle - particle and particle - hole channels are coupled in a superconductor and to what extent the spin resonance can be viewed as a particle - hole exciton needs to be addressed . in the case of purely repulsive interactions </S>",
    "<S> we find that the particle - particle channel at total momentum @xmath4 ( the @xmath5channel ) contributes little to the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the interband density - density interaction is attractive and the @xmath6resonance is possible on its own , along with spin - exciton , we find a much stronger shift of the resonance frequency from the position of the would - be spin - exciton resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the expected double - peak structure in this situation does not appear because of the strong coupling between particle - hole and particle - particle channels , and @xmath7 displays only a single peak . </S>"
