    "we conclude that :    \\1 .",
    "the total cross sections for neutrino induced 1@xmath7 production from free proton are closer to the @xmath7 production cross sections obtained by the anl experiment and are smaller than the @xmath7 production cross sections obtained by the bnl experiment in the intermediate energy region . in this energy region , there is a @xmath164 theoretical uncertainty in the total cross section due to use of various parameterization of n-@xmath3 transition form factors .",
    "the total cross sections for 1@xmath7 production is dominated by the incoherent process .",
    "the contribution of the coherent pion production is about 4 - 5@xmath128 in the energy region of 0.7 - 1.4 gev .",
    "\\3 . in the neutrino energy region of 0.7 - 1.4",
    "gev , the results for the ratio of cross section of 1@xmath7 production to the quasielastic lepton production is described quite well for @xmath165 , when nuclear effects in both the processes are taken into account . however , for energies higher than @xmath166 , the theoretical value of the ratio underestimates the experimental value .",
    "this might be due to 1@xmath7 contribution coming from the excitation of higher resonances which are not included in the present calculations .",
    "the role of nuclear medium effects is quite important in bringing out the good agreement between the theoretical and experimental value of the ratio for the total cross sections for @xmath167 production and quasielastic lepton production for neutrino energies upto 1.0 gev . for @xmath153 ,",
    "the nuclear medium effects reduce the charged current quasielastic scattering cross section by @xmath146 , while 1@xmath7 production cross section is reduced by 40@xmath128 .",
    "the results for @xmath157 vs @xmath8 in @xmath1c and @xmath2o averaged over the miniboone and k2k spectra have been presented for the incoherent and coherent charged current one pion production with various n-@xmath3 transition form factors .",
    "we have also presented the results for the nuclear medium and the final state interaction effects on the @xmath8 distribution .",
