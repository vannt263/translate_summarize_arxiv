    "in the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation , dark matter ( dm ) haloes provide the potential well in which galaxies subsequently form . as a consequence the structural parameters of disk galaxies ( size and rotation velocity ) are tightly coupled with those of their hosting dm halo , such as concentration and spin ( e.g. mo , mao & white 1998 ; dutton 2007 ) .",
    "it has been shown by several studies that the structural properties of dark matter haloes are dependent on halo mass : for example higher mass halos are less concentrated ( navarro , frank & white 1997 , hereafter nfw ; bullock 2001a , hereafter b01 ; eke navarro & steinmetz 2001 ; kuhlen 2005 ; neto 2007 ; macci 2007 , hereafter m07 ) , and are more prolate ( jing & suto 2002 ; allgood 2006 ; m07 ) on average . in the case of the spin parameter , however , there seems to be no mass dependence .",
    "in m07 we used a set of numerical simulations of structure formation in a @xmath7cdm cosmology , with cosmological parameters that were motivated by the first year results of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) mission ( spergel 2003 ; hereafter wmap1 ) , to study how concentrations , shapes and spin parameters of dark matter haloes scale with halo mass . in this paper",
    "we extent the m07 study by investigating how these scaling relations depend on the adopted cosmology .",
    "in particular , we present a large suite of numerical simulations for @xmath7cdm cosmologies whose parameters are motivated by the three and five year data releases of the wmap mission ( spergel 2007 ; komatsu 2008 ) . in what follows",
    "we refer to these cosmologies as the wmap3 and wmap5 cosmologies , respectively .",
    "the parameters of the wmap1 , wmap3 and wmap5 cosmologies are listed in table [ tab : params ] .",
    "note that the wmap3 and wmap5 cosmologies both have a lower matter density , @xmath8 , and a lower power spectrum normalization , @xmath9 ( defined as the rms of the matter field , linearly extrapolated to the present , on a scale of @xmath10 ) than the wmap1 cosmology .",
    "this implies that dark matter haloes of a given mass assemble later ( e.g. , van den bosch 2001 ) . since the concentration of a dark matter halo is related to its assembly redshift ( e.g. , wechsler 2002 ; zhao 2003a , b ; li 2007 )",
    ", dark matter haloes are expected to be less concentrated in the wmap3 and wmap5 cosmologies .",
    "this may help to reconcile the conflict between the concentration parameters inferred from the rotation curves of dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies ( de blok , mcgaugh & rubin 2001 ; swaters 2003 ) and those predicted from the scenario .",
    "in addition , a lower amplitude of the power spectrum results in haloes being more prolate ( allgood 2006 ) , which may have observational implications for the rotation curves of dark matter dominated galaxies .    as in m07",
    "we use a large suite of n - body simulations for the wmap1 , wmap3 and wmap5 cosmologies with different box sizes to cover the entire halo mass range from @xmath11 ( haloes that host dwarf galaxies ) to @xmath12 ( massive clusters ) .",
    "we use these simulations to investigate the concentrations , spin parameters of shapes of dark matter haloes .",
    "we also present a critical comparison of the simulation results with two toy models for the concentration - mass relation .",
    "in particular , we show that the b01 model is only able to reproduce the simulation results in the galaxy mass range , but underpredicts the concentrations of massive haloes . on the contrary",
    ", the nfw model yields a reasonable fit at the massive end , but dramatically underestimates the concentrations for haloes with @xmath13 .",
    "we present a new model , based on a simple modification of the b01 model , that that is able to reproduce the concentration - mass relation over the entire mass range probed by our numerical simulations ."
