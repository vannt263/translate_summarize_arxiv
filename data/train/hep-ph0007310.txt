    "displaced vertices are often assumed to be a characteristic feature of the neutralino sector in extended supersymmetric models with gauge singlets . especially in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) with a singlino - like lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) displaced vertices",
    "are expected in a large part of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "they may appear if the mixing character of the lightest neutralino @xmath2  which is also the lsp  is dominated by the singlino component so that its couplings to the other supersymmetric particles are strongly suppressed .",
    "then in models with conserved @xmath3-parity all supersymmetric particles first decay into the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) which is assumed to be the second lightest neutralino @xmath4 .",
    "the nlsp finally decays into the lsp with a decay vertex displaced from the production vertex if the decay width is small enough .",
    "the direct production of singlino dominated neutralinos in the nmssm and the @xmath0model at an @xmath5 linear collider with polarized beams has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "slow decays in models containing additional singlet superfields with intermediate - scale vacuum expectation values have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this study is a detailed analysis of the low energy parameter regions where displaced vertices of the @xmath4 exist in two representative extended supersymmetric models , the nmssm and an @xmath0  model with an additional neutral gauge boson .",
    "these models are shortly described in sec .",
    "2 .    for this purpose",
    "we first discuss in sec .",
    "3 scenarios where the lightest neutralino has a large singlino component .",
    "the vacuum expectation value @xmath6 of the singlet field turns out to be the crucial parameter responsible for a singlino dominated @xmath2 leading to a displaced @xmath4 decay vertex .",
    "therefore we present in sec .  4 the @xmath4 decay width in representative scenarios as a function of @xmath6 and",
    "show the parameter region where displaced vertices exist .",
    "our main conclusion is that , depending on the neutralino masses and the mass difference between the lightest neutralinos , the singlet vacuum expectation value has to be in the range between several tev and @xmath7  tev in order to observe displaced vertices in these extended models .",
    "the nmssm is the minimal extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) by a singlet higgs field @xmath9 with vacuum expectation value @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the masses and couplings of the five neutralinos depend on the the gaugino mass parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the doublet higgs fields ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) @xmath14 as in the mssm , and on the singlet vacuum expectation value @xmath6 and the trilinear couplings @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the superpotential @xcite @xmath17 in this paper we always assume the gut relation @xmath18 . for large",
    "@xmath19 a singlino dominated neutralino decouples in the neutralino mixing matrix and could become very light for small values of the parameter @xmath16",
    ". then the heavier neutralinos have mssm character with @xmath20 .",
    "such light or even massless singlino dominated neutralinos are not excluded by lep @xcite .",
    "since also light neutral singlet - like higgs bosons can generally exist in the nmssm @xcite the nmssm higgs sector may play an important role for the decay characteristics of the neutralinos .",
    "it contains five physical neutral higgs bosons , three higgs scalars and two pseudoscalars whose masses and mixings depend on the soft scalar masses @xmath21 and @xmath22 in addition to @xmath23 , @xmath6 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    the @xmath0  model with an additional @xmath24 factor in the low energy gauge group and therefore a new neutral gauge boson @xmath25 is a further extension of the mssm beyond the nmssm .",
    "it can be motivated by superstring theory @xcite and implies an @xmath0  group as effective gut group , which is broken to an effective low energy gauge group of rank  5 .",
    "we consider an @xmath0  model with one additional singlet superfield in the higgs sector @xcite",
    ". to respect the experimental mass bounds for new gauge bosons the singlet vacuum expectation value @xmath6 must be larger than about 1.5  tev  @xcite .",
    "the extended neutralino sector in this model contains six neutralinos being mixtures of photino , zino , @xmath25 gaugino , doublet higgsinos and singlino @xcite .",
    "the @xmath26 neutralino mass matrix depends on six parameters : the @xmath27 , u(1)@xmath28 and @xmath29 gaugino mass parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath30 , @xmath23 , @xmath6 and the trilinear coupling @xmath15 in the superpotential @xmath31 in the @xmath0  model the @xmath32 submatrix of the mssm - like neutralinos and the @xmath33 submatrix of the exotic ones approximately decouple because of the large values of @xmath6 . then for very large values of @xmath34 light singlino - like neutralinos occur because of a see - saw - like @xcite mechanism in the @xmath35 submatrix @xcite .",
    "since displaced vertices are only expected for an lsp with a large singlino component we discuss in the following scenarios with a singlino - dominated @xmath36 .    in the nmssm the singlino content of @xmath36",
    "is described by the squared matrix element @xmath37 of the unitary @xmath38 matrix @xmath39 which diagonalizes the neutralino mass matrix in the basis @xmath40 of the photino , zino , the two doublet higgsinos and the singlino .",
    "the mssm content of @xmath36 , described by @xmath41 , is crucial for the couplings of the heavier neutralinos to the lsp and especially for the decay width of the second lightest neutralino .",
    "similarly in the @xmath0  model the @xmath26 neutralino mass matrix is diagonalized by an unitary @xmath26 matrix @xmath39 with @xmath42 describing the singlino content of the lsp . here for @xmath34 the lightest neutralino can be a nearly pure singlino .",
    "since the very heavy @xmath43 with mass @xmath44 decouples nearly completely @xcite , @xmath45 describes the mssm content of the lsp in very good approximation .",
    "[ cpnmx ] shows the contour lines of the singlino content of the lsp in the nmssm and the @xmath0  model @xmath37 and @xmath42 , respectively , in the @xmath10-@xmath6 parameter space for @xmath46 and two values @xmath47 and 400  gev .",
    "the mass of the lsp @xmath48  gev is fixed by the parameter @xmath16 in the nmssm or @xmath30 in the @xmath0  model .",
    "while the singlino content of the lsp significantly increases with @xmath6 it depends only weakly on the other parameters @xmath10 and @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ cpnmx](b ) the sign of @xmath30 is chosen positive .",
    "then the contour lines for positive @xmath10 in the nmssm correspond to those with negative @xmath10 in the @xmath0  model and vice versa because of the relative sign between the submatrices of the minimal and exotic neutralinos in the neutralino mass matrices which is reflected in the signs of the mass eigenvalues of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "they have the same sign for positive @xmath10 in the nmssm , but for negative @xmath10 in the @xmath0model . for @xmath50 in the @xmath0  model the mass eigenvalue of the @xmath2 flips sign and",
    "thus becomes the same as in the nmssm , so that in this case the contour lines of the singlino content of the lsp are similar to those in the nmssm .",
