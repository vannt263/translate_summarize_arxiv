    "in the standard model ( sm ) and its extensions , the higgs boson is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the generation of elementary particle masses .",
    "one of the primary goals of the lhc is to uncover the origin of ewsb and to determine whether a sm higgs boson exists .",
    "a giant step was made recently ; both the atlas and cms collaborations have observed a new boson with the mass of @xmath6 , and its properties are , so far , compatible with the sm higgs @xcite .",
    "the next important step is to investigate whether this particle is indeed responsible for the ewsb and , eventually , to determine whether it is really the sm higgs boson .",
    "to do so , it is crucial to probe the higgs self - interactions , since they trigger the ewsb and are indispensable to reconstruct the higgs potential @xcite .",
    "the higgs pair production at hadron colliders is sensitive to the trilinear higgs self - coupling .",
    "there are four main higgs pair production channels : gluon - gluon fusion via top - quark loop , vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , top - quark pair associated production and double higgs - strahlung @xcite . among these higgs",
    "pair production mechanisms , the gluon - gluon fusion mechanism provides the largest cross section , while the vbf mechanism yields the second largest cross section , which is quantitatively 1 order smaller than that via the former one .",
    "the vbf mechanism shows a clear experimental signature of two centrally produced higgs bosons and two highly energetic forward / backward jets @xcite , but the event analysis is still challenged by the smallness of its cross section @xcite .",
    "therefore , a study of the vbf higgs pair production can be feasible only at high luminosity and very high energy hadron colliders @xcite . at these hadron colliders ,",
    "the higgs pair production via weak vector boson fusion is not only the leading process , which is sensitive to the @xmath7 and @xmath8 interactions but also can be used to study the ewsb by probing trilinear higgs self - coupling . in ref.@xcite",
    "paolo bolzoni _",
    "_ pointed out that the structure function approach @xcite and the qcd factorization approximation work extremely well up to @xmath9 corrections for the vbf processes , and the remaining contributions which are kinematically and parametrically suppressed , are practically negligible .",
    "the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) qcd corrections to the vbf single higgs production at the lhc have been evaluated by using the structure function approach in refs . @xcite and @xcite , separately .    in this work",
    "we present the calculations of the vbf higgs pair production at hadron colliders with high luminosity or very high energy up to the qcd nnlo by using the structure function approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we give a brief description of the structure function approach , and the strategy of the qcd nnlo calculation .",
    "the numerical results and discussion are presented in sec .",
    "a short summary is given in sec .",
    "4 . in the appendix",
    "the explicit expressions for coefficients @xmath10 are provided .",
    "the structure function approach is a very good approximation to the vbf processes at hadron colliders , which is accurate at a precision level well above the typical residual scale and parton distribution function ( pdf ) uncertainties @xcite .",
    "this approximation is based on the absence or smallness of the qcd interference between the two inclusive final proton remnants .",
    "the mechanism of the vbf higgs pair production is analogous to the vbf single higgs production .",
    "it can be viewed as the double deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) of two ( anti)quarks with two virtual weak vector bosons independently emitted from the hadronic initial states fusing into a higgs boson pair @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the interference between the higgs pair radiated off the fusing weak vector bosons and the double higgs - strahlung process via @xmath11 is negligible , and therefore the latter process is treated separately .",
    "furthermore , the vbf higgs pair production event can be easily selected because it includes two widely separated jets with high invariant mass .",
    "therefore , we can use the structure function approach to provide the precision predictions at the qcd nnlo accuracy for the vbf higgs pair production process at hadron colliders as used in the calculations for the vbf single higgs production .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the vbf higgs pair production in proton - proton collisions are depicted in fig.[fig1 ] , where @xmath12 denote the 4-momenta of the initial protons , the virtual vector boson @xmath13 can be either @xmath14 or @xmath15 , @xmath16 stands for the goldstone boson , and @xmath17 are the proton remnants .        by applying the structure function approach , the cross section for the vbf higgs pair production can be calculated by contracting the dis hadronic tensor @xmath18 with the matrix element of the vector boson fusion subprocess @xmath19 . the leading - order ( lo )",
    "feynman graphs for the @xmath20 process are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "the differential cross section for the vbf higgs pair production process can be expressed as        @xmath21    where @xmath22 here @xmath23 stands for the contribution of the @xmath24 @xmath1 fusion process , @xmath25 denotes the fermi constant , @xmath26 is the proton - proton colliding energy squared in the center - of - mass system ( c.m.s ) , @xmath27 is the mass of vector boson @xmath13 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the usual dis variables , and @xmath30 is the invariant mass squared of the @xmath31 th proton remnant . by adopting the feynman gauge , the matrix element of @xmath24 fusion subprocess can be expressed as @xmath32       \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\sqrt{2 } g_f m^2_v}{(q_1+k_1)^2-m^2_v}(2 k^\\mu_1+q^\\mu_1)(-k^\\nu_1+k^\\nu_2-q^\\nu_1 )      \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\sqrt{2 } g_f m^2_v}{(q_1+k_2)^2-m^2_v}(2 k^\\mu_2+q^\\mu_1)(k^\\nu_1-k^\\nu_2-q^\\nu_1 ) ,      \\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the mass of @xmath14 or @xmath15 , @xmath34 is the sm trilinear higgs self - coupling , and @xmath35 is the vacuum expectation value of higgs field .",

    "the interferences between the @xmath39 and @xmath40 channels with identical final quarks ( e.g. , @xmath41 ) , and between the processes with @xmath42 and @xmath43 fusions ( e.g. , @xmath44 ) at the lo , nlo , and nnlo in qcd are normally nonfactorizable .",
    "these nonfactorizable contributions would make eq.([factorization ] ) being incorrect even at the lo .",
    "however , these interference effects are heavily suppressed by kinematics for the vbf higgs pair production .",
    "we have calculated these interference contributions at the lo by applying feynarts-3.7 and formcalc-7.4 packages @xcite and found that they contribute less than @xmath45 to the total cross section .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to neglect these interference contributions in the qcd lo , nlo , and nnlo calculations .",
    "apart from these interference effects , in the qcd nnlo calculation , the diagrams involving the exchange of gluon between the two quark lines are also nonfactorizable . the same as in the vbf single higgs production case @xcite",
    ", this nonfactorizable correction at the qcd nnlo is negligible for the vbf higgs pair production .",
    "we express the matrix element squared as @xmath46 the explicit expressions for @xmath10 are collected in the appendix .",
    "the explicit expressions for the dis structure functions at the lo and nlo have been given in refs.@xcite , and the nnlo expressions can be found in refs.@xcite . in general ,",
    "the dis structure functions are expressed as convolutions of the pdfs with the wilson coefficient functions @xmath47 .",

    "the wilson coefficients can be obtained up to the qcd nnlo from refs.@xcite , and the accurate parametrization of them can be taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "we developed a fortran program to evaluate the numerical results for the vbf higgs pair production process by employing the structure function approach . to verify the correctness of our calculations",
    ", we use our fortran code to calculate the vbf higgs pair production process at the qcd nlo accuracy by taking the same conditions as in ref.@xcite , i.e. , adopting the structure function approach and the mstw2008 ( @xmath48 c.l . )",

    ", we will discuss three kinds of uncertainties : ( 1 ) the scale uncertainty , which is an estimate of the missing higher - order contributions in the perturbative calculation ; ( 2 ) the pdf uncertainty ; and ( 3 ) the uncertainty related to the fitted value of the strong coupling constant @xmath59 and the parametric uncertainties related to the experimental errors .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the cross section depends on the factorization scale @xmath60 , which originates from the convolution of the perturbative partonic cross section with the nonperturbative pdfs , and the renormalization scale @xmath61 that comes from the running of @xmath5 .",
    "an estimate of the missing higher - order corrections can be considered as the variation of the central cross section with respect to these two scales . for simplicity",
    "we take the factorization scale being equal to the renormalization scale , i.e. , @xmath62 , and define @xmath63 .",
    "we fix the central scale value as @xmath64 with @xmath65 varying in the range of @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "there , the central scale is the virtuality of the vector bosons which fuse into the higgs boson pair .",
    "that is the most natural central scale choice for vbf processes @xcite . in figs.[fig3](a , b ,",

    "analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the results concerning the relative corrections at the nnlo accuracy are less related to the renormalization and factorization scales than those at the nlo accuracy .",
    "that means the nnlo qcd corrections are very important in improving the scale uncertainty and make it possible to take full advantage of modern pdf sets at the same accuracy .",
    "we can also see from fig.[fig4 ] that at the position of the central scale ( @xmath91 ) the relative corrections @xmath79 and @xmath80 are @xmath92 and @xmath93 at the @xmath84 lhc and have the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 at the @xmath96 hadron collider , respectively .",
    "these results show also the choice of @xmath91 can keep better convergence in the perturbative calculation than other values of @xmath81 .",
