    "the characteristic velocities can reach up to 1000 times higher .",
    "for this reason the field values we explore may be potentially important for the development of new fast conductors very different from superconductors .",
    "typically high drift velocities are nonlinear and non - ohmic .",
    "non - ohmic high drift velocities depending on the field strength were observed experimentally in many different systems [ 5],[7 ] .",
    "theoretical models were developed in part based on fokker - planck models with complicated friction and diffusion functions including negative friction [ 8]-[10 ] .",
    "nonlinear non - ohmic conductance phenomena were studied experimentally and theoretically also in nonlinear driven electric circuits [ 11]-[13 ] .",
    "different approaches in the framework of polaron theory were given in [ 14]-[19 ] , and this list could easily be extended .",
    "we note that the low - field drift corresponds to a high conductivity which may be much higher then the drude conductivity . here",
    "we study the conductivity in the framework of fokker - planck theory .",

    "the result of numerical evaluations of the current for a large set of values of the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath131 is shown graphically in fig .",
    "the panels show the behavior of @xmath238 for various values of the parameters @xmath131 and @xmath239 .",
    "the graphs reveal that the typical shape of the @xmath238 profile is similar to that in the cases @xmath16 = 1 and @xmath16=2 .",
    "however , they also demonstrate some new aspects , such as the individual dependence on the parameters @xmath236 and @xmath131 , which gives rise to different shapes of the curves .",
    "this property demonstrates that the characteristic dependence on the field may be very different and depends sensitively on the particular set of @xmath236 and @xmath131-values .",
    "this sensitivity provides the interesting possibility to shape a `` characteristics on demand '' , just by choosing particular values of @xmath236 and @xmath131 .",
    "the problem of providing a `` current - voltage characteristics on demand '' might be of interest for applications to problems of nonlinear electronics .",
    "the generalization of the fokker - planck theory developed in this paper may provide the tools for constructing a particular desired characteristics .    by our analysis , based on the fokker - planck models , we have shown in the present paper that nonlinear effects may substantially increase low field conductivity . typically , as shown by the examples given in figs . 5 and 6",
    ", the increase reduces at high electrical fields again to the value provided by the linear drude theory .",
    "therefore , the search for highly conducting materials should include nonlinear effects and the present generalized fokker - planck model may give important hints for search of highly conducting materials by variations of the material and system parameters ( such as the effective temperature d and the friction @xmath22 ) .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that the nonlinear theory may give important tools how to shape a `` current - voltage characteristics on demand '' .",
