    "low density parity check ( ldpc ) codes were first discovered by gallager @xcite in 1962 and have recently been rediscovered and generalized by mackay @xcite in 1999 .",

    "another remarkable algebraic construction of ldpc codes is finite geometry ( fg ) codes @xcite@xcite ; these codes are divided into euclidean ( or affine ) geometry ( eg ) codes , which are included in qc codes , and projective geometry ( pg ) codes , which are included not in qc codes but in broader _ generalized quasi - cyclic ( gqc ) codes _ ( cf .",

    "it can be stated briefly that gqc codes increase the randomness for qc codes and vary each length of cyclic parts in qc codes .    for several classes of qc ldpc codes ,",

    "the first algorithm is based on gaussian elimination , and the second algorithm is the generalization of lally _ et al . _",

    "both algorithms employ buchberger s algorithm to create a grbner basis from codewords .",

    "then , we review grbner basis of modules over polynomial rings ; the complete theory of grbner basis is referred to @xcite@xcite , and that of automorphism group and orbit is referred to @xcite .      consider a linear code @xmath7 of length @xmath0 , where @xmath8 is a prime power and @xmath9 is @xmath8-element finite field .",

    "@xcite define gqc codes as @xmath42$]-submodules of a certain module @xmath43 at in the next subsection , where we will see that their definition of gqc codes is equivalent to our definition .",
    "usually , the generator matrix of a linear code indicates the matrix whose rows are linearly independent and compose a basis of the linear space .",

    "thus , @xmath47 is made from 4 cyclic codes defined by @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ( and two all - zero codes ) , and @xmath47 is a gqc code with 3 orbits .",

    "moreover , if @xmath53 , then we come back to cyclic code . in order to increase the randomness of the codes ,",
    "it is desirable that we can combine various circulant matrices ( cf .",
    "section [ generalized ] ) to generate new gqc codes .",
    "the code in figure [ subcodes ] , a ) shows us a 2-orbit gqc code constructed from four matrices .",
    "on the other hand , figure [ subcodes ] , b ) shows that the code is also obtained from four matrices but is not a gqc code .",
