    "the low temperature conductivity of disordered metals or semiconductors is dominated by the elastic scattering of electrons off impurities and defects .",
    "while the conductivity is determined by drude - boltzmann theory for not too low temperatures , quantum corrections to the conductivity become important at temperatures low enough that the electronic phase remains well defined over distances large in comparison to the elastic mean free path.@xcite one usually distinguishes two quantum corrections , the weak localization correction and the interaction correction.@xcite the former is caused by the constructive interference of electrons traveling along time - reversed paths , whereas the interaction correction can be understood in terms of resonant scattering off friedel oscillations near impurities.@xcite    although they are small in comparison to the drude conductivity , the quantum corrections are important because they strongly depend on temperature and an applied magnetic field , whereas the drude conductivity does not ( as long as impurity scattering is the dominant source of scattering ) .",
    "theoretically , the temperature and magnetic - field dependences of the corrections can be expressed in terms of the sample s diffusion constant ( or , equivalently , the elastic mean free path ) , which can be obtained independently from a measurement of the drude conductivity .",
    "the availability of quantitative theoretical predictions has made a detailed comparison between theory and experiment possible.@xcite    the same quantum corrections also exist for a ` quantum dot ' , a conductor coupled to electron reservoirs via artificial constrictions ( _ e.g. , _ tunnel barriers or point contacts ) , such that the conductance of the device is dominated by the contacts and not by scattering off impurities or defects inside the sample .",
    "the latter condition is satisfied if the product @xmath0 of the dot s ` thouless energy ' and its density of states is much larger than the dimensionless conductance of the contacts connecting the dot to source and drain reservoirs .",
    "( the thouless energy is the inverse of the time needed for ergodic exploration of the quantum dot . )    in this article we consider ` open ' quantum dots , which have contact conductances larger than the conductance quantum @xmath1 .",
    "because transport through a quantum dot is dominated by the contacts , it is described by the sample s conductance , not its conductivity .",

    "e.g. _ , in their shape or precise impurity configuration .    while the magnetic - field dependence of quantum corrections to the ensemble averaged conductance is in apparent agreement with the theory,@xcite the situation regarding the temperature dependence is more complicated and no good agreement has been reported to date .",
    "theoretically , the temperature dependence of the weak localization correction to the conductance of a quantum dot is described by means of a ` dephasing rate ' @xmath2 . for a quantum dot ,",

    "the absence of a separate method to determine this constant poses a significant difficulty when comparing theory and experiment .",
