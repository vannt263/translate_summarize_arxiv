    "progress in nanolithography and epitaxial techniques has resulted in burgeoning developments in the fabrication of micro - scale optical resonators , known as optical microcavities .",
    "if a quality factor of a cavity is sufficiently large , the formation of hybrid light - matter excitations occurs .",
    "being observed for the first time two decades ago , @xcite the strong coupling regime is now routinely achieved in different kinds of microcavities .",
    "@xcite from the point of view of fundamental physics this regime is interesting for investigation of various collective phenomena in condensed matter systems such as the high - temperature bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xcite and superfluidity .",
    "@xcite from the viewpoint of applications it opens a way forward to the realization of optoelectonic devices of a new generation : @xcite room - temperature polariton lasers @xcite , polarization- controlled optical gates , @xcite effective sources of thz radiation , @xcite and others .",
    "several applications of the strong coupling regime were also proposed for quantum information processing .",
    "@xcite in this case one should be able to tune the number of emitted photons in a controllable way .",
    "this is hard to achieve in planar microcavities , where the number of elementary excitations is macroscopically large , but is possible in microcavities containing single quantum dots ( qds ) , where the qd exciton can be coupled to a confined electromagnetic mode provided by a micropillar ( etched planar cavity ) , @xcite a defect of the photonic crystal , @xcite or a whispering gallery mode .",
    "@xcite that is why the strong coupled systems based on qds have attracted particular attention recently . in the strong coupling regime",
    "the system possesses a rich multiplet structure , which maps transitions between quantized dressed states of the light - matter coupling hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite    on the other hand , there is a considerable interest in non - simply - connected nanostructures , such as quantum rings ( qrs ) , which have been obtained in various semiconductor systems .",
    "@xcite this interest is caused by a wide variety of purely quantum mechanical topological effects which are observed in ring - like nanostructures and are absent in quantum dots .",
    "the star amongst them is the aharonov - bohm effect , @xcite in which a phase of a quantum particle is influenced by a vector potential which results in magnetic - flux - dependent oscillations of the particle energy .",
    "recently it was shown that an external lateral electric field , which is known to reduce the qr symmetry and suppress the energy oscillations for the low - energy states , @xcite also modifies optical properties of the qr .",
    "@xcite namely , the application of a weak electric field leads to magneto - oscillations of the degree of polarization of optical transitions between the ground and the first excited states , which are typically in the thz range .",
    "when the magnetic flux through the qr is equal to a half - integer number of flux quanta , these transitions are linearly polarized with the polarization vector normal to the direction of the external electric field , and their frequencies are completely controlled by the magnitude of the applied electric field .",
    "@xcite this provides additional means of tuning the qr emission spectrum .    in the present work",
    "we examine a single - mode thz microcavity @xcite with an embedded aharonov - bohm quantum ring , which is pierced by a magnetic flux and subjected to a lateral electric field .",
    "we restrict our analysis to linearly polarized microcavity radiation only .",
    "the geometry of the system is shown in fig .",

    "the emission properties of such a system under continuous incoherent pumping are studied theoretically .",
    "we calculate the luminescence spectrum of the system using the master equation techniques for several combinations of the applied external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we demonstrate that the resonance , which is best for exploring quantum features of the system , @xcite can be achieved by means of tuning the magnitude of the lateral electric field .",
    "an additional degree of control can be achieved by changing the angle between the polarization plane of the optical pump and the lateral electric field . as we show",
    ", the qr - microcavity coupling strength depends strongly on the above mentioned angle .",
    "in this section we revise the energy spectrum and optical properties of a single - electron aharonov - bohm qr pierced by a magnetic flux @xmath0 and subjected to a lateral electric field @xmath1 , which were studied in refs . and .",
    "in the absence of the external electric field the eigenfunctions of an infinitely narrow aharonov - bohm qr of a radius @xmath2 are given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the polar angle coordinate and @xmath5 is the angular momentum quantum number .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy scale of the interlevel separation in the qr , @xmath8 is the electron effective mass and @xmath9 is the number of flux quanta piercing the qr ( @xmath10 ) . for experimentally attainable qrs , @xmath11 corresponds to the thz frequency range .",
    "@xcite    when the lateral electric field is applied , the modified electron eigenfunctions can be expressed as a linear combination of the unperturbed wave functions ( [ qrwfunction ] ) : @xmath12 substituting the wave function ( [ qrmwfunction ] ) into the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian containing a term which describes the presence of the lateral electric field , multiplying the resulting expression by @xmath13 , and integrating with respect to the angle @xmath4 results in an infinite system of linear equations for the coefficients @xmath14 @xmath15 c_{m } + \\beta \\left ( c_{m+1 } + c_{m-1 } \\right ) = 0\\,\\mbox { , } \\label{linearsystem}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the normalized strength of the lateral electric field and @xmath17 is an energy eigenvalue normalized by @xmath11 .",
    "it can be seen from the system of equations ( [ linearsystem ] ) that all the qr quantities are periodic in the magnetic flux @xmath0 with the period equal to @xmath18 .",

    "one can see that as the angle @xmath40 is changed , the emission peaks shift towards the microcavity eigenfrequency @xmath55 , which can be explained by reducing the coupling strength @xmath78 .",
    "this effect provides an additional way to control the frequency of the satellite peaks in the qr - microcavity emission spectrum and allows a purely spectroscopic measurement of the pump polarization .    in this work we dealt exclusively with the qr inter - subband transitions .",
    "however , a similar analysis should be possible for inter - band optical transitions , for which matrix elements and energies can also be tuned by the external fields much easier than in the widely studied qd systems .    in conclusion",
    ", we have analyzed the emission spectrum of an aharonov - bohm quantum ring placed into a single - mode quantum microcavity .",
    "we have shown that the emission spectrum in the strong coupling regime has a multiplet structure and can be tuned by the variation of the magnetic field piercing the quantum ring and by changing the strength and direction of the applied lateral electric field .",
    "thus , it is demonstrated that a microcavity with an embedded qr is a promising system for use as a tunable optical modulator in the thz range .",
    "the qr - microcavity system , which allows manipulation of quantum states with external fields , might also prove to be useful for investigating dephasing mechanisms and for engineering and exploring enhanced light - matter interactions for novel quantum investigations .",
