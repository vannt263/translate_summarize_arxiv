    "soft condensed matter systems , such as vesicles , microtubules and membranes , have recently attracted a lot of attention in both biological and industrial applications @xcite .",
    "more generally , physical systems at the nanoscale including nanotubes and electronic and photonic waveguide structures @xcite have nontrivial geometry and are influenced by substrate effects .",
    "these wide classes of problems , many of which are inherently nonlinear , raise the question of the interplay between nonlinearity and an adaptive substrate , including , in particular , a possibility of developing curvature in the substrate due to feedback forces from the nonlinear system .",
    "some of these systems such as , for instance , the dna double strand @xcite , are also inherently discrete .",
    "in this situation , the derivation of evolutionary equations for intrinsic fields in a nonlinear system interfacing with a flexible substrate should take into regard the local dynamics and the feedback of the substrate . a context where these phenomena can easily manifest themselves",
    "is elasticity .",
    "usually , models of particles connected by springs , such as the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite , assume that the springs are strictly linear .",
    "however , in reality the spring constant may depend on the spring s stretch . in this case , we are meaning not a straightforward generalization of the fk model that includes the spring s anharmonicity , but a different system , in which the spring constant obeys its own dynamical equation , see below .",
    "there is an increasing body of literature dealing with the interplay of nonlinearity , discreteness , and a substrate subject to curvature .",
    "usually , even if the substrate is curved , its geometry is assumed to be _ fixed _ , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "however , for many applications , ranging from condensed matter to optics to biophysics , it is quite relevant to examine a prototypical model that admits a possibility of a variable substrate , which is affected by the primary field(s ) and feeds back into its ( their ) dynamics .    in this work ,",
    "we introduce a simple one - dimensional model which captures some of the physically essential features of the interplay of a nonlinear system with a flexible substrate . a natural setting for the model",
    "is a lattice with on - site nonlinearity , or its continuum counterpart ( see below ) , hence the first ingredient of the system is the fk model ( alias the discrete sine - gordon equation @xcite ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the coupling constant ( the spring constant , if we consider adjacent sites as being coupled by springs ) , @xmath2 is the discrete laplacian , while the last term in eq .",
    "( [ beq1 ] ) is the on - site nonlinearity .",
    "the overdot denotes the temporal derivative , while @xmath3 indexes the lattice sites .",
    "the fk model has a plethora of physical realizations , the simplest one being the scott s model , i.e. , a chain of pendula suspended on a torque - elastic thread @xcite .",
    "the springs can be made nonlinear by assuming that the constant @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ beq1 ] ) is replaced by a _",
    "site - dependent _ one , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the constant mean value , while @xmath6 is the variation of the spring constant due to the variation of the displacements @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the sites that the spring couples .",
    "the simplest nontrivial possibility , provided that we aim to produce a hamiltonian system , is to assume that @xmath6 responds to a change in displacements according to the following equation : @xmath9 , \\label{beq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is an intrinsic stiffness of the spring ( see below ) , and @xmath11 accounts for its susceptibility to the stretch .",
    "we use the convention ( see also a sketch of the system in fig . [ cfig1 ] ) that the @xmath3-th spring connects the sites @xmath12 and @xmath3 . to maintain the hamiltonian character and self - consistency of the model , the equation for the field @xmath7",
    "should be modified [ cf .",
    "( [ beq1 ] ) ] to read : @xmath13 in fact , the extra terms added to eq .",
    "( [ beq3 ] ) can be easily understood in terms of the mechanical model : a difference in the value of the string constant produces a difference in the elastic forces even if there is no change in the length of the springs .",
    "equations ( [ beq2 ] ) and ( [ beq3 ] ) are derived from the hamiltonian @xmath14 @xmath15 .\\ ] ] we note that a somewhat similar ( but still significantly different ) two - component model was proposed to describe the coupling between protons and heavy ions in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also references therein ) . a single - component model with nonlinear springs",
    "was examined ( mainly in terms of its thermodynamic properties ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .    while this work is focused on the simplest model based on eqs .",
    "( [ beq2 ] ) and ( [ beq3 ] ) , which includes only the linear coupling between the fields @xmath7 and @xmath6 , we note that a relevant generalization may involve quadratic couplings : @xmath16 .",
    "\\label{beq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the origin of the quadratic terms is evident : they stem from second - order effects combining the change in the string length and elasticity .",
    "the continuum limit ( cl ) of eqs .",
    "( [ beq5 ] ) and ( [ beq6 ] ) is @xmath17 where the constants @xmath11 and @xmath18 were appropriately rescaled , and the subscripts stand for partial derivatives . setting @xmath19 in eqs .",
    "( [ beq7 ] ) and ( [ beq8 ] ) yields the cl of eqs .",
    "( [ beq2 ] ) and ( [ beq3 ] ) .",
    "note that , even in the latter case , the lorentz invariance of the cl equations is broken ( in comparison with the sine - gordon equation , which is the cl of the usual fk model ) .",
    "an exact solution for the static kink ( the topological soliton in the @xmath20subsystem ) can be easily found ( for the case @xmath19 ; @xmath10 is then rescaled to be 1 ) , @xmath21 \\ , ,   \\label{beq9 } \\\\ v & = & 2\\frac{k}{\\sqrt{1-k^{2}}}{\\rm sech}\\left ( \\frac{x - x_{0}}{\\sqrt{1-k^{2 } } } \\right ) \\ , ,   \\label{beq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but exact solutions for moving kinks are not available even in the cl limit .",
    "also worth noting is the cl for the linear spectrum of extended waves , which can be obtained by substituting @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the linearized version of eqs .",
    "( [ beq7 ] ) and ( [ beq8 ] ) . for @xmath19 and with the normalization @xmath24",
    ", we obtain @xmath25 which consists of two phonon bands , one with @xmath26 , and the other one with @xmath27 .",
    "notice the presence of a finite gap between these bands , provided that @xmath28 . in the case",
    "@xmath29 , the lower branch of the linearized spectrum is acoustic , while the upper one is always of the optical ( alias , plasmon ) type .",
    "returning to the discrete case , there is no explicit solution for the static case ; however , after the substitution of @xmath30 , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ beq3 ] ) , the steady - state equation for @xmath7 becomes @xmath31 and hence @xmath11 effectively renormalizes the lattice coupling .",
    "in fact that is what can be observed from eqs .",
    "( [ beq9 ] ) and ( [ beq10 ] ) , as well as from fig .",
    "[ cfig2 ] : the effect of @xmath11 is to decrease the width of the kink ( by a factor approximately equal to @xmath32 , for @xmath11 small ) . as is well known @xcite , a narrower kink is less mobile . a numerical solution of the static discrete equation ( [ static ] ) yields , similar to the case of the regular fk model @xcite , two types of steady - state discrete kinks , namely a stable inter - site centered one ( an example for @xmath33 is shown in fig . [ cfig2 ] ) and an unstable site - centered one .",
    "we have examined the variation of the static kink solutions and of their linear stability eigenvalues ( for small perturbations ) as a function of @xmath32 .",
    "typical examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ cfig3 ] for the stable and unstable kinks for @xmath34 .",
    "a surprising finding in both cases is that the solutions could be continued for some range _ beyond _ the point @xmath29 , which is effectively equivalent to the zero - coupling ( _ anti - continuum _ ) limit , see eq .",
    "( [ static ] ) .",
    "the shape of the solutions found for @xmath35 is non - monotonic ( but they remain _ stable _ ) .",
    "these solution branches terminate at @xmath36 for the stable solution , and at @xmath37 for the unstable site - centered one .",
    "the above - mentioned expectation that the kink becomes less mobile as @xmath32 increases is verified dynamically by taking an initial kink boosted to the speed @xmath38 .",
    "solving eqs .",
    "( [ beq7 ] ) and ( [ beq8 ] ) ( with @xmath19 ) with this initial condition for different values of @xmath11 , we notice that , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ cfig4 ] , the kink travels farther for @xmath39 than it does for @xmath28 , despite the fact that the initial velocity is the same in all the cases . in other words , the effective velocity which the kink demonstrates differs from that which was lent to it initially ,",
    "and it also depends on @xmath32 .",
    "finally , we have also examined kink - antikink collisions in the system of eqs .",
    "( [ beq2 ] ) and ( [ beq3 ] ) .",
    "an example of this type is shown in fig .",
    "[ cfig5 ] . in this case , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , and the initial speeds of the kink and antikink are @xmath42 .",
    "the figure indicates the possibility of existence of parameter windows for which the kinks eventually escape each other s attraction ( upon multiple bounces ) .",
    "such windows lie between intervals of merger ( kink - antikink annihilation into a breather ) .",
    "this feature is reminiscent of well - known findings of ref .",
    "@xcite for kink - antikink collisions in continuum ( nonintegrable ) models .",
    "however , unlike what was found in that work , here the windows are in terms of the parameter @xmath11 , observed at a fixed value of the collision velocity .",
    "an example of such a window ( a chacteristic case of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ cfig5 ] ) occurs for @xmath43 , even though in the fk model ( e.g. , for @xmath39 , a case also shown in fig . [ cfig5 ] ) , for @xmath44 , only annihilation is possible .",
    "notice that for this value ( @xmath45 ) of the initial speed ( and within our resolution steps of @xmath46 in @xmath11 ) , no additional windows were identified .",
    "however , by considering different values of the initial speed ( such as e.g. , @xmath47 ) , we have verified that typically multiple such windows can occur .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the present model , which is essentially richer than in its fk counterpart , is provided for by the fact that the kink s internal mode is affected by variations of the coupling to the substrate ( see the discussion above ) .",
    "the case of @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ beq2 ] ) has its own interest , as in this case @xmath6 may be regarded as an acoustic phonon branch ( the one without a gap in its dispersion relation ) , which interacts with the optical ( plasmon ) branch represented by the field @xmath7 .",
    "equations ( [ beq2 ] ) and ( [ beq3 ] ) with @xmath48 furnish an elementary example of this type of interaction . in this case",
    ", the equations have _ solely _ uniform zero - velocity solutions .",
    "nontrivial solutions may only exist with a finite speed @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , the model s cl gives rise , in this case , to a double ( @xmath50 ) kink ( not shown here ) , which is produced by the equation @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "however , this simplest version of the model with @xmath48 is flawed , as its hamiltonian is unbounded from below , hence the model is not a well - posed one .",
    "it can be amended to fix this problem , keeping the optical - phonon and acoustic - phonon character of the fields @xmath7 and @xmath53 , but detailed consideration of this issue is beyond the scope of the present work .    to conclude , in this work we have proposed a simple , prototypical model , that may be developed to describe dynamics of kink - shaped excitations in more complex systems .",
    "a noteworthy extension would be the generalization of the model to two dimensions , which may be very relevant for physical applications .",
    "furthermore , dissipative versions of the model can be of direct relevance to chemical and biophysical applications .",
    "detailed consideration of higher - order feedback effects , collisions between kinks , and long - lived breather - like states in this model would also be of interest .",
