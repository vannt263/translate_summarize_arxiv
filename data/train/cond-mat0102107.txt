    "recent advances in nanotechnology has made it possible to fabricate quantum dots so small that coulomb blockade can be observed up to room temperature .",
    "in such small dots , single ",
    "particle energies due to the size quantization are comparable to the electrostatic charging energy and interaction effects can modify the entire energy spectrum . important information about interactions in such quantum systems can be obtained by studying the spin states .",
    "however , it proved to be a formidable task to measure the spin of a few - electron system experimentally .",
    "so far , the most successful mapping of spins in a few - electron dot has been achieved indirectly , by comparing an experimentally obtained addition spectrum to the theoretically calculated energy spectrum for a particular geometry@xcite .",
    "the problem of measuring spin directly in the most versatile and well studied vertical and lateral quantum dots is that the magnetic field @xmath0 dependence of their energy levels is dominated by orbital effects due to the weak confinement of electrons by electrostatic gates .    in our small si samples we are able to measure the spin of a few - electron quantum dot directly .",
    "the dots uniquely combine the flexibility to change the number of electrons @xmath1 starting from 0 with the strong electron confinement provided by the sharp si / sio@xmath6 interface . at @xmath7 t",
    ", the @xmath0-dependence of energy levels is dominated by the zeeman shift and we are able to measure the difference between the spin of the successive ground states @xmath8 directly as electrons are added into the dot one by one . also , we can follow the change of the spin configuration of the dot with a fixed number of electrons as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "for one of the samples we can explain observed transition for the groundstates with up to 5 electrons within a simple model of a few energy levels which cross each other in magnetic filed as a result of zeeman splitting .",
    "some many - body effects , such as spontaneous dot polarization and spin blockade@xcite due to the spin change @xmath5 has been observed .",
    "the measurements were performed on small si quantum dot fabricated from a silicon - on - insulator wafer .",
    "the dot resides inside a narrow bridge patterned from the top si layer .",
    "a 50 nm thick layer of thermal oxide is grown around the bridge followed by a poly - si gate .",
    "the fabrication steps have been described previously in details@xcite .",
    "spacing between excited levels @xmath9 mev , measured using non - zero bias spectroscopy , is comparable to the charging energy @xmath10 mev and is consistent with the lithographical size of the dot @xmath11  .",
    "peak position as a function of @xmath12 is determined by the degeneracy condition that the electrochemical potentials for the ground states with @xmath13 and @xmath1 electrons in the dot are equal .",
    "it has long been realized that for non - interacting electrons the field dependence of the peak positions @xmath14 can be directly mapped onto the single - particle energy spectrum of the dot @xmath15 , provided that the fermi energy @xmath16 in the contacts is field independent . for a dot with a weak confining potential we expect energy levels to shift by @xmath17 or by the level spacing , whichever energy is smaller , and",
    "the shift should strongly depend on the direction of the magnetic field due to the dot anisotropy .      in fig .",
    "[ shift]a the conductance is plotted as a function of the gate voltage for sample e5 - 5b .",
    "the dot contains a few electrons ( we estimate @xmath20 electrons at @xmath21 v ) and the number of electrons can be changed by varying the gate voltage , each peak corresponding to an electron added to or removed from the dot . in fig .",
    "[ shift]b , the shift of each peak at @xmath19 t , relative to its zero - field position , is plotted .",
    "the average peak shift is much less than @xmath22 mev ( @xmath23 mv for this sample ) and is determined by the level spacing .",
    "the most striking result is that the shift is almost independent on the @xmath0 direction , which suggests that spin effects dominate .",
    "it is possible to separate orbital and spin effects if contacts are spin polarized , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spectr ] . in the plot",
    "an excitation spectrum of another dot , e5 - 3b , is shown for the entrance of the first electron . at low gate voltage @xmath24 v the contact is spin polarized for @xmath25 t and the zeeman shift of the first energy level is fully compensated by the zeeman shift of the fermi energy in the contacts .",
    "thus , the resulting shift is solely due to orbital effects ( assuming that @xmath26-factors in the dot and in the contacts are the same ) .",
    "the net shift of the levels in a parallel field ( the smallest cross section ) is negligible , while there is a small but measurable parabolic dependence on @xmath27 ( the largest cross section ) . the net shift at 10 t is @xmath28 mev and zeeman energy should dominate the @xmath0 dependence ( @xmath29 mev at @xmath19 t ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice , that although orbital effects are not effecting the position of the energy levels appreciably , they can considerably change transmission coefficients .",
    "for example , at high perpendicular field the peaks , marked with the dot and triangle in fig .",
    "[ spectr ] , become suppressed , while the third peak is enhanced , compared to the @xmath18 value .    ) and dark lines are the positions of the excited levels . in c ) and d ) conductance as a function of bias , measured along the thick line in a ) , is plotted for two configurations of the magnetic field : along the current direction ( @xmath30 ) and perpendicular to the surface of the sample ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the curves are offset by 0.08 @xmath31s / t .",
    "the data in c ) and d ) appears slightly different because they were taken at different conditions : c ) ac bias 30 @xmath31v and @xmath32 k , d ) ac bias 100 @xmath31v and @xmath32 k , except the @xmath33 t curves which were taken at 4 k. in b ) shifts of the three peaks , marked by a dot , a triangle and a circle in c ) and d ) , are plotted as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath27 .",
    "according to the capacitance model the conversion factor for the shift into energy @xmath34 .",
    "however , the slope of the lowest-@xmath12 peaks in the @xmath35 plane is increased by a factor of 4 , compared to the slopes for the peaks with @xmath36 , suggesting that it requires an extra bias to force the first electron into the dot .",
    "thus , we estimate @xmath37 . ]    for a larger number of electrons @xmath38 the contacts are spin - degenerate up to the highest experimental field of 13 t and the shift of energy levels mainly reflects the zeeman shift of the tunneling electron .",
    "peaks shift with a slope @xmath39 as a function of @xmath0 and the slope changes sign every time the two levels with different spin cross each other .",
    "evolution of the peaks for up to 5 electrons in the dot can be understood within a model of non - interacting electrons and singlet - triplet and triplet - polarized transitions are identified as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "peak 6 has a large slope @xmath40 at low @xmath0 and is strongly suppressed at low @xmath41 .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath2 ground state is spontaneously polarized at @xmath18 and the peak suppression is due to the long predicted spin blockade@xcite . for larger numbers of electrons , @xmath4 , we observed transitions with @xmath42 with no apparent suppression of the peaks at low @xmath41 .",
    "the spin scattering mechanism involved is not currently understood .",
    "these data will be published elsewhere@xcite ."
