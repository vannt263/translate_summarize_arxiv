    "the control of the orientational order of liquid crystals ( lcs ) by magnetic field is much less wide - spread in practise than the control by electric field .",
    "the reason for this is the relatively small anisotropy of the diamagnetic susceptibility of liquid crystals . in order to overcome",
    "this difficulty , doping of lcs with magnetic nanoparticles has been proposed theoretically long time ago @xcite .",
    "after the first experimental realization @xcite , the idea has been extensively tested in ferronematic suspensions of various compositions ",
    "see e.g. , @xcite , review articles @xcite , and references therein . during these experiments",
    "an important difficulty has arisen : the aggregation of the nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "a measurable optical response to low ( potentially important for applications ) magnetic field has been reported only lately .",
    "a linear response has been detected in planarly oriented ferronematic samples far below the threshold of the magnetic fredericksz transition @xmath1 , howerver , in the presence of a weak orienting bias magnetic field ( @xmath2 mt ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that a similar response can be obtained even in the absence of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this paper was to explore the role of @xmath0 , of the initial pretilt , and that of the aggregation of nanoparticles on the response of ferronematics to low magnetic fields ( below @xmath1 ) .",
    "the thermotropic nematic 4-(trans-4-n - hexylcyclohexyl)-isothiocyanatobenzene ( 6chbt ) was used as the lc matrix , which was doped either with spherical fe@xmath3o@xmath4 nanoparticles having a mean diameter of about @xmath5  nm @xcite , or with single - wall carbon nanotubes functionalized with fe@xmath3o@xmath4 nanoparticles ( swcnt / fe@xmath3o@xmath4 ) @xcite in a relatively high volume concentration of @xmath6 .",
    "the ferronematics have been filled into @xmath7 m thick , planarly oriented cells .",
    "the planar orientation was ensured by the anti - parallel rubbing of the polyimide layers coated on the inner surfaces of the two glass plates constituting the cell .",
    "the experimental setup was similar to that described in refs .",
    "the cells were placed in a costum - made hot - stage having a thermal stability better than @xmath8c .",
    "the cells could be exposed simultaneously to a magnetic induction @xmath9 ( up to @xmath10 ) , to an electric electric field @xmath11 , and to an orienting bias magnetic field of @xmath12 in an experimental geometry shown schematically in fig.[fig : toth_fig1 ] .",
    "the capacitance @xmath13 and the conductance @xmath14 were monitored by a hioki 3522 impedance analyzer .",
    "additionally , the setup allowed for optical studies in which the intensity of the transmitted light @xmath15 was measured with crossed polarizers at an orientation of @xmath16 with respect to the initial director @xmath17 .",
    "a laser diode emitting at @xmath18  nm was used as a light source .",
    "the measurement control as well as the data collection was ensured by a labview program .    in the theoretical description of the planar orientation",
    "it is usually assumed that the nematic director @xmath17 ( the unit vector describing the orientational order of the lc ) is parallel with the bounding glass plates [ fig.[fig : toth_fig1](a ) ] . in real cells",
    ", however , @xmath17 encloses a small pretilt - angle with the glass plates , as shown in fig.[fig : toth_fig1](b ) . for cells with antiparallel rubbed polyimide layers , the pretilt - angle @xmath19 is typically between @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "a nonzero @xmath19 breaks the symmetry and therefore , one has to distinguish between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions of the bias magnetic field @xmath0 , as indicated in fig.[fig : toth_fig1](b ) .     ",
    "the direction of the magnetic field , @xmath24  the direction of the electric field , @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath25  direction(s ) of the orienting bias magnetic field.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the relative capacitance variation @xmath26 is shown in fig.[fig : toth_fig2 ] ( @xmath27 is the smallest value of the capacitance ) with and without a bias magnetic field of @xmath28 mt . for undoped",
    "6chbt neither @xmath9 nor @xmath0 gave rise to a change of @xmath26 below @xmath29 [ see fig.[fig : toth_fig2](a ) ] .",
    "note that because of the presence of the pretilt , the fredericksz transition is not sharp ; it becomes continuous in all experiments and therefore , one can define an apparent value of @xmath29 only  see e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "the application of @xmath22 @xmath0 slightly decreases this apparent @xmath29 .",
    "this is rather surprising , since naively one would expect that @xmath0 stabilizes the initial planar alignment ( because of the positive anisotropy of the diamagnetic susceptibility of 6chbt ) , and therefore , slightly increases @xmath29 .",
    "we will come back to this question in a later discussion .     for 6chbt ( a )",

    "the application of @xmath0 of either @xmath22 or @xmath23 directions suppresses this dependence ( especially for the @xmath23 direction ) .",
    "this conclusion has also been confirmed by optical measurements of the phase shift @xmath30 between the ordinary and extraordinary waves to be discussed later .",
    "note that @xmath22 @xmath0 slightly decreases @xmath29 again ( as in 6chbt ) , while on the contrary , @xmath23 @xmath0 slightly increases @xmath29 compared to that detected in the absence of @xmath0 .    in 6chbt doped with spherical fe@xmath3o@xmath4 nanoparticles",
    "the dependence @xmath31 is qualitatively different : it is not a monotonic function , but it has a minimum below @xmath29 [ see fig.[fig : toth_fig2](c ) ] .",

    "the decrease or increase of the apparent @xmath29 depending on the application of @xmath22 or @xmath23 @xmath0 , respectively , can be understood by taking into account the pretilt angle . from the schematic representation in fig.[fig : toth_fig1](b ) it becomes obvious that when both @xmath9 and @xmath22 @xmath0 are applied , the direction of the net magnetic field encloses a smaller angle with @xmath17 compared to the situation when only @xmath9 is applied .",

    "again , the apparent value of @xmath29 is slightly decreased when the @xmath22 @xmath0 is applied [ fig.[fig : toth_fig3](b ) ] .",
    "another focus of the present work was to investigate how the aggregation of nanoparticles influences the response of the ferronematics to low magnetic fields .",
    "for this purpose , a sample of 6chbt and a cell filled with 6chbt doped with swcnt / fe@xmath3o@xmath4 has been monitored on a long time scale without a bias magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "we measured the relative capacitance versus b after different times elapsed from the cell preparation in a ferronematic system with carbon nanotubes and compared them with the time independent characteristics of 6chbt .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[fig : toth_fig4 ] .     for 6chbt and 6chbt",
    "doped with swcnt / fe@xmath3o@xmath4 measured at different times elapsed from the cell preparation.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    as one sees , the first measurement on the ferronematic ( made a few hours after its preparation ) results in the largest capacitive response to the applied magnetic field @xmath9 . as time elapsed , the response got weaker , and within a month it almost disappeared : after 26 days from preparation the response of the ferronematic differs from that of 6chbt only in small details ( a slight slope of @xmath31 , and a somewhat smaller @xmath29 ) .",
    "the idea that the aggregation of nanoparticles is behind the above described effect is supported by optical microscopy .",

    "lastly we present results on the temperature dependence of the birefringence @xmath70 . using the measured maximal phase shift @xmath66 and sample thickness @xmath71 for a known @xmath72 , the birefringence @xmath70 can be calculated . in fig.[fig : toth_fig6 ] the temperature dependence of the birefringence is presented for 6chbt as well for 6chbt doped with swcnt / fe@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "data taken from the literature @xcite are also shown for comparison . from fig.[fig : toth_fig6 ] several conclusions can be made .",
    "first , doping 6chbt with swcnt / fe@xmath3o@xmath4 even in a relatively high concentration does not influence significantly the nematic to isotropic phase transition temperature @xmath73 .",
    "secondly , the doping does not change the birefringence , and thirdly , our results are in reasonable agreement with the data from the literature .",
    "finally , we mention that in order to obtain precise values of @xmath70 , one has to achieve a full realignment during the fredericksz transition ; i.e. , one has to increase the field to several times of the threshold value .",
    "due to limitations of our electromagnet a high enough magnetic field could not be reached ( @xmath74  t corresponds to @xmath75 ) .",
    "therefore , the electric field induced fredericksz transition was used for the @xmath70 measurements .",
    "measured for 6chbt and 6chbt doped with swcnt / fe@xmath3o@xmath4 compared to the values for 6chbt taken from the literature @xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]",
    "in summary , we have shown that the orienting bias magnetic field @xmath0 is not a prerequisite for the response of ferronematics to low magnetic fields . moreover , as we have demonstrated , in some cases @xmath0 even suppresses the response .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0 shifts the critical field of the magnetic fredericksz transition @xmath29 ( increases or decreases it depending on the direction of @xmath0 ) because of the presence of a pretilt in planarly oriented samples .",
    "we have pointed out the importance of the aggregation of nanoparticles , which decreases the response of ferronematics to low magnetic fields .",
    "we have also shown that doping the lc with swcnt / fe@xmath3o@xmath4 does not change the birefringence , nor the nematic to isotropic phase transition temperature .",
    "the experimental results presented in this work give rise to further questions for which the answers require additional experimental and theoretical research in the future . among these questions we underline two .",
    "first , it is still unknown what and by which mechanism(s ) causes the optical and dielectric response of ferronematics to low magnetic fields .",
    "second , why is this response qualitatively so much different in ferronematics obtained by doping with swcnt / fe@xmath3o@xmath4 and with spherical fe@xmath3o@xmath4 [ _ cf .",
    "_ figs.[fig : toth_fig2](b ) and ( c ) ]",
    "? the latter question is even more intriguing in the light of the results obtained for lower ( @xmath76 ) volume concentrations of the spherical fe@xmath3o@xmath4 nanoparticles and at somewhat higher temperature ( @xmath77 ) , where a linear @xmath31 has been obtained @xcite in contrast to the non - monotonic behavior shown in fig.[fig : toth_fig2](c ) .",
