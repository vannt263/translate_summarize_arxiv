    "inverse quantum scattering methods @xcite represent useful techniques to assess effective interactions between colliding composite particles in a model independent way . in nuclear physics the modified newton - sabatier ( mns ) method",
    "@xcite has been used to determine , in general , complex valued optical potentials describing various systems , e.g. , @xmath1c  @xmath1c elastic scattering @xcite or to guess the spin - orbit potentials arising in the @xmath2  @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xmath3 collisions @xcite .",
    "the newton - sabatier ( ns ) method @xcite has the property that it requires an infinite set of phase shifts otherwise the first moment of the potential generated vanishes .",
    "this induces an unpleasant oscillation of the potential at large distances , in addition to the artificial singularity at the origin which remains to be present in the potentials generated also by the mns method .    in the recent decade",
    "another procedure , the cox - thompson ( ct ) inverse quantum scattering method @xcite has been investigated @xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage that it requires a finite set of phase shifts and possesses a non - zero first momentum of the potential generated .",
    "in addition to this , in general , it also reproduces test potentials better than the mns method @xcite .",
    "the ct method has been applied so far to uncharged particle scattering in order to reconstruct short ranged potentials from synthetic phase shifts @xcite , and also to construct @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath3 potential from experimental data @xcite .",
    "we shall develop here the method further with the intention that the ct method can be applied to charged particle scattering when the potential to be constructed has a long ranged coulomb tail .",
    "the various extensions will be applied to both synthetic and experimental phase shifts .",
    "the results are obtained by using the nonlinear solver package of matlab .",
    "the original ct method belongs to the fixed - energy procedures when a finite set of @xmath5 phase shifts @xmath6 is converted to the spherical potential @xmath7 appearing in the @xmath8th partial wave radial schrdinger equation @xmath9 with boundary conditions @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath11    we shall also refer to another form of the schrdinger equation @xmath12 where dimensionless quantities have been introduced for the distance @xmath13 , for the potential @xmath14 with @xmath15 , and the dimensionless wave function @xmath16 is related to the wave function @xmath17 through the asymptotic normalization constant @xmath18 .",
    "the conversion from phase shifts @xmath19 to potential @xmath7 can be carried out in two steps @xcite .",
    "first , we solve either of the following two systems of highly non - linear equations @xmath20 with @xmath21_{ll}[m_{\\cos}^{-1}]_{ll ' } e^{\\pm   i(l - l')\\pi/2 } , \\qquad l\\in s.\\ ] ] and @xmath22 for the set @xmath23 of the shifted angular momenta @xmath24 where the relations @xmath25 and @xmath26 hold .",
    "next , one calculates the potential as @xmath27 where @xmath28 with @xmath29 where the coefficient functions @xmath30 are calculated by solving the system of linear equations @xmath31}{l(l+1)-l(l+1)}=v_l(x),\\qquad l\\in s\\ ] ] with @xmath32 being the regular and irregular solutions of the dimensionless free radial schrdinger equation for the @xmath4th partial wave ( riccati - bessel functions @xcite ) .",
    "note that the set @xmath23 of shifted angular momenta @xmath33 contains real or ( in case of complex phase shifts ) even complex numbers .    using the behaviour of these functions at the origin and infinity ,",
    "one easily derives the following properties of the cox - thompson potential . at the origin",
    "we get @xcite , in general , a constant @xmath34 with the matrix @xmath35 and the constant quantity @xmath36 .    at the infinity",
    "the ct potential in general falls off like an inverse power of two @xmath37 where the coefficients depending on the set @xmath23 are defined by the following relations @xmath38 with the coefficients @xmath39 defined via the asymptotic expansion functions @xmath40 which admits a periodic expansion @xcite as @xmath41 because of the form of the asymptotic version of equation ( [ al ] ) @xmath42",
    "in nuclear physics one frequently encounters charged particle scattering .",
    "the appearance of the long ranged coulomb potential requires an appropriate extension of the ct method which will be carried out in various ways in this section .",
    "all the different extensions rely upon the two - potential formalism @xcite .",
    "consider a spherical potential @xmath7 which can be written as a sum of a short - ranged interior ( or nuclear ) part @xmath43 and a long - ranged exterior ( asymptotic or reference ) part @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 then the phase shift itself is also split into two parts @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the phase shift due to @xmath48 and @xmath49 corresponds to the phase shifts caused by @xmath43 ( in the presence of @xmath48 ) . if , for instance , @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 .",
    "if the short ranged part of the potential is zero beyond a finite distance @xmath53 , @xmath54 then , accordingly , the radial wave function can be written in this region as @xmath55 in the latter equation the functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 mean , respectively , the regular and irregular solutions of the dimensionless radial schrdinger equation ( [ dimsch ] ) with potential @xmath58 .      we may design a modified potential @xmath59 which is identical with the original one ( up to a constant energy shift ) within the interior region @xmath60 and zero outside @xmath61",
    "thus if equation ( [ hatv ] ) applies the @xmath62 interior potential can be deduced from @xmath63 .",
    "the radial scattering wave function of this problem at the shifted energy @xmath64 is identical with the original one in the inside region @xmath65 but differs in the outside region @xmath66 the equality of the logarithmic derivatives at @xmath67 @xmath68 with @xmath17 from ( [ psiref ] ) gives the transformed phase shifts @xmath69 which can be used to ( re)construct the short ranged potential @xmath70 ( [ splitpot-1 ] ) . to get",
    "the whole original potential one simply adds the reference potential @xmath71 if it is known .",
    "the phase shift transformation method enables the use of the ct method as formulated in the preceding section .",
    "it requires that the modified potential @xmath70 be constructed from the set @xmath72 by the actual inverse method as accurately as possible . but",
    "no exact fixed energy inverse scattering method has yet been formulated which is able to produce a short range potential that is exactly zero beyond a finite radius , if a finite set of phase shifts is employed .",
    "therefore , one always introduces a small error into the potential ( re)construction when applying the phase shift transformation procedure .",
    "the phase shift transformation method has been introduced by may , mnchow and scheid @xcite and is widely applied in case of the modified newton sabatier method .",
    "it is applied also to the ct inverse procedure to treat coulomb scattering @xcite and we shall call this combined method as the pct method .      based on the two potential formalism one can derive a generalized ct ( gct ) scheme which employs the given nuclear phase shifts @xmath73 for constructing the short - ranged ( nuclear ) potential @xmath74 but avoids use of a matching radius @xmath53 . the derivation starts with the ansatz for the input symmetrical kernel of the gelfand - levitan - type integral equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the lesser ( greater ) of @xmath77 .",
    "then , by proceeding through the usual steps @xcite , one arrives at a system of nonlinear equations identical in structure to ( [ general ] ) @xmath78 with @xmath21_{ll}[m_{\\cos}^{-1}]_{ll ' } e^{\\pm   i\\left[(l - l')\\pi/2+\\delta_{l'}^{(0)}-\\delta_l^{(0)}\\right ] } , \\qquad l\\in s,\\ ] ] and @xmath79 for the set @xmath23 of the shifted angular momenta @xmath33 where the relations @xmath25 and @xmath80 hold . from the set @xmath23 one calculates the nuclear potential as @xmath81 where @xmath28 with @xmath82 the coefficient function @xmath30 is calculated by solving the system of linear equations @xmath83}{l(l+1)-l(l+1)}=g^{(0)}_l(x),\\qquad l\\in s,\\ ] ]    from this gct scheme several developments are possible as the actual form of the reference potential has not yet been specified .",
    "if one sets the reference potential to be the bare coulomb potential @xmath84 with @xmath85 being the sommerfeld parameter then one arrives at the coulomb ct ( cct ) method . in this case",
    "the regular and irregular reference functions are the regular and irregular coulomb functions , the reference phase shift becomes the coulomb phase @xmath86,\\qquad l\\in s.\\ ] ]    here it should be mentioned that in the course of application of cct method it may become necessary to know the regular and irregular coulomb functions and coulomb phases for complex orders .",
    "for example , in case of non - elastic scattering the phases are complex and therefore , as noted before , the @xmath33 numbers are also complex valued .",
    "the coulomb functions are well - defined for complex orders and similarly to the real order case they can be given as power series ( for details see e.g. @xcite and appendix ) .",
    "it is interesting that contrary to the fact that the asymptotic form of the reference functions contains the well known logarithmic term @xmath87 in the argument , it does not appear in the gct formulas because of cancelation .    using the known power series of the coulomb functions it can be shown that the cct method gives a potential which is proportional to the coulomb potential near the origin . for one term , i.e. @xmath88 , we get @xmath89\\frac{2\\eta}{kr}+o(1).\\ ] ] for large @xmath90 we get @xmath91_{ll}\\cos(\\theta_l(kr)+\\theta_l(kr))+o\\left(\\frac{1}{{(kr)}^3}\\right),\\ ] ] with @xmath92 .",
    "we see that the cct method generates an inverse potential that gives a coulomb - like singularity at the origin and produces a damped oscillation around the coulomb tail at large distances .",
    "it is free of the matching parameter @xmath53 and requires just the nuclear phase shifts @xmath49 which are derived by the usual phase shift analysis procedures .      in order to obtain an inverse potential that is finite at the origin , instead of being singular there",
    ", we can modify the coulomb reference potential accordingly .",
    "this reference potential is constant in the interior domain and purely coulombic outside .",
    "this modified coulomb potential is the same as that employed by the phase transformation method for coulomb asymptotics and reads as @xmath93 to this reference potential there belong the following regular and irregular radial wave function @xmath94 and reference phase shift @xmath95 the coefficients @xmath96 can be calculated from the equality of the inner and outer wave functions and their derivatives at the matching radius @xmath53 .",
    "for example , the two coefficients necessary for calculating the reference phase shift are @xmath97 with @xmath98 and prime denotes derivation with respect to argument .",
    "the total phase shifts can be written in two different ways @xmath99 where @xmath49 means the nuclear phase shifts given as data and @xmath100 is to be used to perform the ct inverse calculation outlined above .",
    "the potential obtained by the mct method has a finite value at the origin .",
    "because this method employs a similar reference potential as the pct method , the results provided by the two methods should also be very similar , although quite different functions are used in the calculations .",
    "the advantage of the mct over the pct lies in that it does not involve the small error in the phase shift reproduction inherent to the pct .",
    "to illustrate the general applicability of the long - range ct inversion procedures we shall first use them to reconstruct model potentials .",
    "we model the @xmath3  @xmath3 scattering with two slightly different potentials :",
    "the first is finite at the origin and the second is singular ( describing a possible non - locality ) .",
    "the first model potential is given by @xmath101 where the nuclear interaction is described by a woods - saxon form @xmath102 and the coulomb interaction is represented by the potential of a homogeneous charged sphere as @xmath103    for the various parameters we choose the following values : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 mev , @xmath109 fm , @xmath110 fm .",
    "we have calculated the nuclear phase shifts @xmath49 at energies @xmath111 and @xmath112 mev ( see tables [ tab0 ] and [ tab01 ] ) .",
    "these phase shifts are then used as input data for the various ct calculations .",
    "the results for the @xmath33-values obtained using the nonlinear solver of matlab are shown in tables [ tab0 ] and [ tab01 ] .",
    "the corresponding potentials are displayed in figure [ fig0 ] .",

    "we have developed the cox - thompson ( ct ) fixed energy inverse quantum scattering method into various directions in order to make it appropriate for treating long range interactions . by explicit calculation",
    "we have shown that the modified ( mct ) and phase transformed ( pct ) methods yield practically the same potentials although quite other functions are involved in the calculation .",
    "these potentials are generally finite at the origin therefore they can be used for cases with no singularity at small distances .",
    "the coulomb ( cct ) method produces a characteristic coulomb singularity at the origin .",
    "this method can be applied with success when nonlocality or a repulsion hard core plays a role in the interaction .",
    "we have applied the methods first to model cases with and without singularity .",
    "the model potentials describing @xmath118 scattering are well reproduced by the new methods according to their characteristic properties concerning the finiteness or infiniteness at the origin .",
    "then , the experimental @xmath0 phases of ali _ et al _ @xcite have been inverted with the result that the cct potentials showing up a repulsive hard core reproduce better the input phase shifts than the pct potentials which exhibit a woods - saxon shape . whether or not the repulsive core is present between the proton and alpha particle when being scattered by each other",
    "should be clarified also using independent source of information ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the authors thank the dfg for supports through the contract no . .",
    "in certain applications of both the cct and mct formulations of the cox - thompson inverse scattering method for long - ranged potentials it is necessary to evaluate the regular and irregular coulomb wave functions for complex orders . based on @xcite the evaluation",
    "is accomplished by using the power series given below .",
    "the regular coulomb wave function for @xmath119 complex order is given by @xmath120^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\gamma(2l+2)}\\cdot x^{l+1}\\sum_{j = l+1}^\\infty c_j^l(\\eta)x^{j - l-1},\\ ] ] and the @xmath121 constants are defined by the recursion @xmath122 this production of the @xmath123 is a simple analytic continuation of the formulae in @xcite .",
    "however the irregular coulomb wave function can not be given by such a simple generalization .",
    "we utilize therefore the fact that the coulomb wave functions and the whittaker functions are related to each other linearly for fixed @xmath33 and @xmath124 . by means of the whittaker functions",
