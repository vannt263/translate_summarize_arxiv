    "purity is a good measure of the coherence of a quantum system .",
    "it is unity for a system in a pure state ( complete quantum coherence ) , while it reduces to @xmath1 for an @xmath2-level system in a completely mixed state ( no quantum coherence ) .",
    "purity has played a central role in the discussion of the quantum measurement problem @xcite , in the sense that the occurrence of decoherence , considered to be responsible for the transition from a quantum to a  classical \" ( mixed ) state by the action of measurement , is one of the main issues to be resolved within the framework of quantum theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , its importance is well recognized in the field of quantum information , communication and computation , for the purity of a subsystem is an important measure of the entanglement of the total bipartite system @xcite : the higher the entanglement between the two subsystems , the lower the purity of the reduced density matrix of the subsystems , and _",
    "vice versa_.    although purity is an important physical notion , it is not so simple to devise an experimental procedure to directly measure it .",
    "remember that the quantum mechanical expectation value of an operator @xmath3 in the state @xmath4 is expressed as @xmath5 .",
    "this is a _ linear _ functional of @xmath4 , while purity @xmath6 is a _",
    "quadratic _ functional .",
    "purity is usually calculated only after the state @xmath4 has been reconstructed by some tomographic methods @xcite .",
    "there are , however , interesting proposals @xcite to measure linear and nonlinear functionals of the density matrix , including purity @xmath7 , without resorting to any tomographic methods .",
    "one assumes that copies of the quantum system under scrutiny ( target system ) are available , so that the state @xmath8 can be fed to an interferometric setup in a quantum network .",
    "in particular , to determine the purity @xmath7 of the target system , one requires a controlled - swap operation and an ancillary two - level quantum system ( qubit ) .",
    "in this paper we present an alternative scheme for measuring the purity of a quantum system with a finite number of levels [ typically a two - level system ( qubit ) or a three - level system ( qutrit ) ] , without resorting either to the state tomography of the density operator or to interferometry in quantum networks . in this way ,",
    "a relatively small number of ( different ) measurements are required @xcite .",
    "in particular , our scheme consists of two simple two - input gates , such as @xmath0 , and does not rely on the three - input controlled - swap gate @xcite , whose explicit construction is not trivial .",
    "moreover , the necessary ancillas , that interact with the target systems @xcite , could be automatically supplied by projective measurements performed on a fraction of the ensemble itself of target systems . as we will show in explicit examples ,",
    "our strategy does not rely on the independent preparation of ancillary systems , provided the ancillas are still available for further manipulations after the projective measurements .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gen ] , we present the general ideas .",
    "we show here how to extract information about the purity of a quantum system .",
    "as stated above , since purity is a quadratic functional of the density matrix , we prepare the initial state in a tensor - product form which includes two system density matrices .",
    "an ancilla system is introduced and coupled to the system under consideration . a unitary operation ( gate ) ,",
    "coupling the system and the ancilla , is applied twice in succession . finally , a measurement on the ancilla yields information on the purity of the system .",
    "neither tomographic nor interferometric setups is introduced .",
    "these general ideas are then made concrete by explicitly constructing the unitary operator and by identifying the necessary measurements in the case of a two - level system ( qubit ) in sec .",

    "let a quantum - mechanical system ( target system ) with @xmath2 discrete levels be described by a density matrix @xmath4 , which can be characterized by a generalized @xmath9-dimensional bloch vector @xmath10 .",
    "our goal is to measure its purity @xmath11 .",
    "assume that we can prepare the target state @xmath4 in duplication , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "we also prepare another quantum system ( ancilla ) with @xmath2 discrete levels in a particular pure state @xmath13 .",
    "the initial state reads @xmath14 observe that this ancilla can be supplied by a fraction of the ensemble of the target state @xmath4 by performing an appropriate projective measurement , which is required in our scheme for the estimation of purity , as we will see below , and one could thus reduce the number of different resources required .",
    "we first make one of the duplicated target systems interact with the ancilla via a unitary evolution operator ( gate ) @xmath15 . after the interaction ,",
    "the information about the target state @xmath4 has been transferred to the ancilla and they are in an entangled state . the total system is then exposed to another interaction , this time only between the other target system and the ancilla , governed by the same type of unitary evolution operator @xmath15 .",
    "finally , a suitable observable of the ancilla is measured , from which information about the purity of the target system can be extracted .",
    "the state of the ancilla just after each step , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , is expressed in the following way . define the map acting on two qunits @xmath18 where @xmath15 is a unitary operator on @xmath19 and the trace @xmath20 is taken over the first system ( left - hand side of the tensor product ) .",
    "the states of the ancilla after the first and second step read @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "note that we do not measure the target systems ( and therefore take the partial traces to get the ancilla state ) .",
    "since the final state of the ancilla , represented by the reduced density matrix @xmath17 , depends quadratically on @xmath4 and therefore quadratically on its bloch vector @xmath10 , the expectation value of an ancilla s observable is expected to carry part of the information about @xmath23 ( because in general there remains no larger symmetry that keeps @xmath24 invariant ) .",
    "this is why we have presented the target state @xmath4 in duplication .",

    "the situation is exactly what happens in our case and also in those cases where an interferometric setup is used @xcite .    since we need @xmath2 types of projective measurements for the target system and for the ancilla after the successive gate operations , and since the system has to be prepared in duplication , the number of necessary resources is @xmath131 , which is to be contrasted with the three resources necessary in the interferometric setup @xcite .",
