    "as is already known from classical optics , the use of instruments in optical experiments needs careful examination with regard to their action on the light under study .",
    "fibres , beam splitters , cavities , spectral filters etc .",
    "are familiar examples of optical instruments , which are typically built up by dielectric bodies . in quantum optics",
    "an important aspect is the influence of such material bodies on the quantum features of light including its interaction with ( microscopic ) atomic systems .",
    "for example , let us consider a @xmath0 beam splitter oriented at @xmath1 to an incident light beam . in classical optics",
    "the beam splitter simply divides the incoming beam into two ( apart from a phase shift ) equal outgoing parts propagating perpendicular to each other , and with the same scaling factor the classical noise of the incident field is transferred to the two fields in the output channels of the beam splitter .",
    "it is intuitively clear that in quantum optics the noise of the vacuum in the unused input port of the beam splitter introduces additional noise in the two output beams and thus the quantum statistics of the output field may differ significantly from that of the input field provided that the input field is prepared in a nonclassical state .",
    "moreover , when two light beams that are prepared in non - classical states are superimposed by the beam splitter , then the outgoing field is prepared in a nonclassically correlated bipartite state , also called an entangled state .",
    "entanglement as a typical quantum coherence feature plays an important role in quantum communication .",
    "let us assume that two light beams have been prepared in an entangled state .",
    "in order to use them , e.g. , in quantum teleportation , the beams should be transmitted through optical channels such as fibres .",
    "here the crucial point is to what extent the entanglement can be preserved during the propagation of the beams , because in any real fibre the absorption gives necessarily rise to an entanglement degradation .    from a more theoretical point of view",
    ", a very interesting question is that of the casimir force between material bodies .",
    "a crude physical explanation of the casimir force is that the vacuum energies of two regions spatially separated by the bodies differ due to the presence of the matter , which in a rough approximation can be described simply by a boundary condition on the quantization volume .",
    "in fact , this simple model does not take account of the dispersive and absorptive properties of the matter and fails in the high - frequency limit where the matter becomes transparent .",
    "these few examples show that it is necessary to include in the theory the presence of material bodies when considering the quantized radiation field and its interaction with atoms . in principle ,",
    "material bodies could be included as a part of the matter to which the radiation field is coupled and treated microscopically .",
    "however , there is a class of material bodies whose action can be included in the quantum theory exactly , namely dielectric bodies that respond linearly to the electromagnetic field , the response being described in terms of a phenomenologically introduced space - dependent dielectric permittivity .",
    "such a concept has  similar to classical optics  the benefit of being universally valid , because it uses only general physical properties , without the need of involved _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the quantum theory of radiation in the presence of dielectric matter has been studied over a long period .",
    "quantization of the electromagnetic field in dielectric media with assumed real and frequency - independent permittivity has been treated extensively @xcite . in the same context",
    ", dispersive dielectrics have been considered @xcite and attempts have been made to extend the concepts to nonlinear media @xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that the permittivity is a complex function of frequency which has to satisfy the kramers  kronig relations , which state that the real part of the permittivity ( responsible for dispersion ) and the imaginary part ( responsible for absorption ) are necessarily connected with each other .",
    "a consequence of the existence of the imaginary part of the permittivity is that the commonly used mode expansion of the ( macroscopic ) electromagnetic field fails , at least in frequency intervals where the absorption can not be disregarded .",
    "obviously , an expansion of the field in terms of damped ( non - orthogonal ) waves would not be complete . from statistical mechanics",
    "it is clear that dissipation is unavoidably connected with the appearance of a random force which gives rise to an additional noise source of the electromagnetic field .",
    "hence , any quantum theory that is based on the assumption of a real permittivity can only be valid for narrow - bandwidth fields far from medium resonances where absorption can safely be disregarded .    for the last years",
    "there has been an increasing number of articles dealing with the problem of the formulation of quantum electrodynamics in dielectric media of given complex permittivity satisfying the kramers  kronig relations @xcite .",
    "a systematic and quantum - theoretically consistent approach to the problem of the quantization of the radiation field in absorbing bulk dielectrics is given in @xcite on the basis of the microscopic hopfield model of a dielectric @xcite .",
    "it is based on an explicit fano - type diagonalization @xcite of a hamiltonian consisting of the electromagnetic field , a ( harmonic - oscillator ) polarization field representing the dielectric matter , and a continuous set of ( harmonic - oscillator ) reservoir variables accounting for absorption .",
    "the resulting expression for the vector potential can be written in terms of the green tensor of the classical scattering problem , which , in fact , makes it possible to perform the quantization of the electromagnetic field in the presence of arbitrary dielectric bodies of ( phenomenologically ) given permittivities @xcite , without referring to specific microscopic models of the bodies , which were hard to establish for general systems .",
    "the concept is based on a source - quantity representation of the electromagnetic field , in which the electromagnetic - field operators are expressed in terms of a continuous set of fundamental bosonic fields via the green tensor of the classical problem .",
    "let us give a brief guide to the topics covered .",
    "after giving an outline of the quantization scheme based on the microscopic hopfield model of a dielectric bulk material ( sec .",
    "[ sec : hopfield ] ) , we show how the classical phenomenological maxwell equations of the electromagnetic field in the presence of dielectric matter of given space- and frequency - dependent permittivity can be transferred to quantum theory ( sec .",

    "we then perform the quantization by identifying the dynamical field variables with bosonic fields associated with the elementary excitations of the composed system ( sec .",

    "having quantized the electromagnetic field , the question arises of how to include in the theory the interaction of the medium - assisted field with atomic systems ( sec .",

    "following the quantization scheme in @xcite , we consider a hopfield model @xcite of a bulk dielectric in which @xmath2 harmonic oscillator fields describing the polarization of the dielectric medium are linearly coupled to a continuum of harmonic oscillators standing for a reservoir .",
