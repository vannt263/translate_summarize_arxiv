    "the study of quantum games is motivated by a desire to understand the nature of quantum information  @xcite and the possibility that it may lead to new or improved algorithms for quantum computers  @xcite .",
    "also , in the field of quantum communication , optimal quantum eavesdropping can be treated as a strategic game with the goal of extracting maximal information  @xcite .",
    "a truel , and its @xmath0player generalization the @xmath0uel , may be used to model such a multiplayer struggle .",
    "we present a quantum scheme with strong analogies to this classic game - theoretic problem .",
    "quantum game theory is an exciting new area that models the interactions of agents that are able to utilize quantum strategies , that is , have the ability to make quantum manipulations .",
    "the study was initiated by meyer  @xcite who showed that a quantum player could always beat a classical one in the simple game of penny flip .",
    "a protocol for two player  two strategy games ( @xmath1 ) with entanglement was developed by eisert and co - workers  @xcite and extended to multi - player games by benjamin and hayden  @xcite .",
    "many problems have now been considered by quantum game theory  @xcite and an experimental realization of quantum prisoners dilemma in a liquid nuclear magnetic resonance machine has been carried out by du _",
    "_  @xcite . for further references and a review of early work in quantum game theory see flitney and abbott  @xcite .    in quantum games , a binary choice of move by a player",
    "is encoded by a qubit , with the computational basis states @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponding to the classical moves .",
    "players carry out local unitary operations on their qubit .",
    "the coherence of the system is maintained until all players have completed their moves .",
    "then a measurement is carried out on the final state and the payoffs are obtained from the classical payoff matrix . by entangling the players qubits , the protocol developed by eisert _",
    "et al _ produces results different from those obtainable through mixed classical strategies .",
    "players can utilize the increased strategic space available through the use of superpositions , as well as entanglement between the agents actions , to give effects not seen in classical game theory including new game equilibria .",
    "in the classic wild western duel , two gunfighters shoot it out and the winner is the one left standing .",
    "this situation presents few game theoretic difficulties for the participants : shoot first and calculate the odds later is always the best strategy ! when this situation is generalized to three or more players",
    "the situation is more complex and an intelligent use of strategy can be beneficial .",
    "for example , alice , bob and charles decide to settle their difference with a shoot out , firing sequentially in alphabetic order .",
    "consider the case where alice has a one - third chance of hitting , bob two - thirds , and charles never misses .",
    "bob and charles will both target their most dangerous opponent : each other .",
    "clearly alice does not want to hit bob with her first shot since then she is automatically eliminated by charles .",
    "surprisingly , alice is better off abstaining ( or firing in the air ) in the first round .",
    "she then gets the first shot in the resulting duel , a fact that compensates for her poorer marksmanship .",
    "precise results for this case are given below .",
    "the paradox of not wanting to fire can been seen most clearly when all three protagonists are perfect shots .",
    "alice is advised not to shoot since after she eliminates one of the others she automatically becomes the target for the third .",
    "unless this is the last round , bob prefers not to fire as well for the same reason . if there is an unlimited number of rounds no one wants to be the first to eliminate an opponent .",
    "the result is a paradoxical stalemate where all survive .    the rules for truels can vary .",
    "firing can be simultaneous or sequential in a fixed or random order , firing into the air can be permitted or not , and the amount of ammunition can be fixed or unlimited . in the current discussion we shall make the following assumptions :    * each player strictly prefers survival over non - survival . without loss of generality",
    "we assign a utility of one to a sole survivor and zero to any eliminated players . *",
    "each player prefers survival with the fewest co - players .",
    "that is , the utility of survival in a pair ( @xmath4 ) or in a three - some ( @xmath5 ) will obey @xmath6 .",
    "* alice , bob and charles have marksmanship ( probability of hitting their chosen target ) of @xmath7 , respectively , independent of their target and with @xmath8 .",
    "there is no probability of hitting a target other than the one chosen .",
    "* the players get no information on the others strategies apart from knowing who has been hit , and in the quantum model , not even that .",
    "* players fire sequentially in alphabetic order with firing into the air permitted .",
    "an analysis of classical truel is provided by kilgour for the sequential  @xcite and the simultaneous case  @xcite . a non technical discussion is provided by kilgour and brams  @xcite .",
    "to get a flavour of some of kilgour s results we shall consider the case where the poorest shot fires first and the best last ( @xmath9 ) and ammunition is unlimited",
    ". first the expectation value of alice s payoff in a duel between alice and bob , with each having @xmath10 bullets , is calculated : @xmath11 when @xmath12 , @xmath13 , hence @xmath14 note that @xmath15 . using this result ,",
    "the expectation values for each player in a truel can be computed .",
    "there are three important strategic mixes to consider depending on alice s strategy .",
    "what ever alice does , bob is advised to shoot at charles since he is the one that bob least wants to fight in a duel , and charles , if he survives , similarly does best by shooting back at bob .",
    "if alice fires in the air on her first shot ( or whenever both other players are alive ) alice is the sole survivor with probability @xmath16.\\ ] ] if alice shoots at bob or charles ( when she has a choice ) her resulting odds of survival are @xmath17 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_{a_c } & = \\frac{1-a}{1-abc } \\left [ \\frac{a(1-b ) + b(1-a)}{1-ab }          \\:+\\ : \\frac{ab(1-c)}{1-ac } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively . from the fact that @xmath18 it follows that @xmath19 so alice never fires at bob while charles is still alive . to make this example concrete , consider the case mentioned above : @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . then @xmath23 which is better than @xmath24 and @xmath25 , meaning that alice is advised to begin by shooting in the air and then to shoot at whoever is left standing after the first round .",
    "surprising , even though alice is the worst shot , this strategy will give her a better than one third probability of survival .",
    "her advantage comes from the fact that she is not targeted until there is only a pair of players left and she gets the first shot in the resulting duel .",
    "in contrast , charles has only a @xmath26 chance of emerging as the sole survivor even though he is a perfect shot ! he has the disadvantage of shooting last and being the one that the others most want to eliminate .",
    "the results can be sensitive to a minor adjustment of the rules .",
    "for example , if the number of rounds is fixed , at some stage alice may be better served by helping bob to eliminate charles , particularly if bob is a poor marksman , even at the risk of not getting the first shot in a duel with bob .",
    "however , the paradoxical disadvantage of being the best shot and the advantage of being the poorest are common to many truels .",
    "although the protocol for @xmath1 quantum games has become quite well established , the quantization of more a complex game situation is not unique . we propose the following model of a quantum truel .",
    "each player has a qubit designating their state , with the basis states @xmath2 and @xmath3 representing `` dead '' and `` alive , '' respectively .",
    "the combined state of the players is @xmath27 . in a quantum duel ,",
    "the third qubit is omitted . in a classical truel",
    "the players are located separately .",
    "however , in the quantum case the qubits representing the states of the players need to be in the one location so that operations can be carried out on the combined state .",
    "we envisage , for example , a referee applying operators with the prior instruction of the players .",
    "the analogue of firing at an opponent will be the attempt to flip the opponent s qubit using a unitary operator acting on @xmath28 . in a duel between alice and bob , the action of alice `` firing '' at bob with a probability of success of @xmath29",
    "can be represented , with maximum generality , by the operator @xmath30 \\langle 11| \\nonumber \\\\          & \\quad + \\left [ e^{\\rmi \\alpha } \\cos(\\theta/2 )",

    "the last two terms of result from the fact that alice can do nothing if her qubit is in the @xmath2 state .",
    "the operator for bob `` firing '' at alice , @xmath33 , is obtained by reversing the roles of the first and second qubits in . for a truel",
    ", similar expressions can be obtained with the third qubit being a spectator .",
    "for example , @xmath34              \\langle 11j| \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\          & \\quad + \\left .",

    "that is , alice carries out a control - rotation of bob s qubit with her qubit being the control ( see ) . firing into the air",
    "is represented by the identity operator . for @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 we shall use the subscripts @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 to refer to alice , bob and charles , respectively .",
    "the operators given flip between the basis states @xmath2 and @xmath3 but do not invert a general superposition .",
    "a general complementing operation in quantum mechanics can not be achieved unitarily  @xcite .",
    "the truel shall be of a fixed number of rounds with the coherence of the state being maintained until a measurement is taken on the final state .",
    "partial decoherence at each step , where the players obtain some information about the state of the system , is a possible extension of our scheme .",
    "expectation values for the payoffs to alice , bob and charles are , respectively , @xmath41 in what follows , we shall take the utility of surviving in a pair to be @xmath42 and the utility of surviving in a trio to be @xmath43 , so that the combined payoff of any outcome is one .",
    "we shall talk of a player being eliminated after a certain number of rounds if there is a probability of one of their qubit being in the @xmath2 state .",
    "as distinct from the classical case , however , the qubit may subsequently be flipped back to @xmath3 , so in fact the player has not been removed from the game . to play a quantum duel or truel , the players list the operators they are going to use in each round before the game begins . in the classical case we made the assumption that the players have no information about the others strategies except to know who has been hit . in the quantum case ,",
    "since a measurement is not taken until the completion of the final round , the players do not even have this information . thus deciding on the set of operators to use at the start of the game",
    "is no loss of generality .",

    "after @xmath10 rounds the state of the system will be @xmath44 after a single round it is easy to see that a measurement taken at this stage will not give results any different from the classical duel with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "the value of @xmath51 and @xmath52 will determine which of the cosine terms alice ( or bob ) wishes to maximize .",
    "for example , with @xmath20 and @xmath53 alice s payoff is maximized for @xmath54 or @xmath55 while bob s is maximized for @xmath56 or @xmath57 ( see ) .",
    "if the players have discretion over the phase factors , a maximin strategy for the two round duel is for the players to select @xmath58 in which case the game is balanced .",
    "the situation for longer duels is more complex .",
    "a classical duel with @xmath20 and @xmath53 gives each player a one third chance of eliminating their opponent in the first round , with a one - third chance of mutual survival from which the process repeats itself .",
    "hence the duel is fair , irrespective of the number of rounds , alice s opportunity to fire first compensating for her poorer marksmanship .",
    "indicates alice s payoff for the quantum case as a function of the number of rounds .",
    "the result is affected by the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 but not by @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    the fact that a measurement is not taken until the completion of the game and that the operators are unitary ( hence reversible ) means that a @xmath2 state can be unwittingly flipped back to a @xmath3 .",
    "thus it may be advantageous for one or other player not to target their opponent .",
    "consider the situation where alice fires in the air on her second shot : @xmath63 then latexmath:[\\ ] ] where the @xmath97 take the values @xmath98 or @xmath38 .",
    "the features of the quantum @xmath0-uel are the same as those of the quantum truel .",
    "positive and negative interference arising from multiple players choosing a common target is more likely and equilibria where it is to the advantage of all ( surviving ) players to shoot into the air still arise .      in the classical case",
    ", players are removed from the game once hit . maintained coherence through out the quantum game",
    "weakens the analogy with classical truel since players can be brought back to `` life , '' that is , have their qubit flipped from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "however , there is still a correspondence . during the game ,",
    "a player can only fire if their qubit is in the @xmath3 state , and they receive a zero payoff at the end of the game if their qubit is in the @xmath2 state .",
    "the classical - quantum correspondence can be enhanced by introducing partial decoherence after each move and allowing the players to choose their strategy dynamically depending on the result of previous rounds . in this case",
    ", the classical situation is reproduced in the limit of full decoherence .",
    "if @xmath99 is the density operator of the system in state @xmath28 , one way of effecting partial decoherence is by @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "this is equivalent to measuring the state of the system with probability @xmath102 .",
    "when @xmath103 is diagonal , the next player can select their target based on the measurement results .",
    "figure  [ fig - decoherence ] shows the regions of the parameter space @xmath90 corresponding to alice s preferred strategy in a one shot truel when charles is a perfect shot ( the situation of figure  [ fig - onetruel ] ) .",
    "the boundary between alice maximizing her expected payoff by firing into the air and targeting charles depends on the decoherence probability @xmath102 .",
    "we then see a smooth transition from quantum case to the classical one as @xmath102 goes from zero to one .",
    "decoherence in quantum games has been considered in a recent publication by chen  @xcite .",
    "a one round quantum duel is equivalent to the classical game , but in longer quantum duels the appearance of phase terms in the operators can greatly affect the expected payoff to the players . if players have discretion over the value of their phase factors a maximin choice can in principle be calculated provided the number of rounds is fixed . if one player has a restricted choice the other has a large advantage .",
    "the unitary nature of the operators means that the probability of flipping a `` dead '' state to an `` alive '' state is the same as that for the reverse , so it can be advantageous for a player to fire in the air rather than target the opponent , something that is never true in a classical duel .",
    "indeed , an equilibrium can be reached where both players forgo targeting their opponent even if there are further rounds to play .    in a quantum truel ,",
    "strategies are not contingent on earlier results .",
    "the players entire strategy ( the list of players to target in different rounds ) can be mapped out in advance based on the expected amplitudes of the various states resulting from different strategic choices by the players .",
    "interference effects arise where a player is targeted by the other two , and can have dramatic consequences , either enhancing or diminishing the probability of survival of the targeted player compared to the classical case . as with the case of the quantum duel ,",
    "equilibria arise where it is to the disadvantage of each player to target one of the others .",
    "such equilibria arise only in special cases in a classical truel .    introducing decoherence after each move changes the quantum game . as the decoherence probability is increased from zero to one ( full measurement ) there is a smooth transition from the fully quantum game to the classical one .",
