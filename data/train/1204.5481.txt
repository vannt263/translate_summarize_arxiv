    "our understanding of star formation has progressed considerably in recent years ( e.g. , @xcite ) , though the exact sequence of the formation of individual stars during a star formation event is not yet entirely understood . in particular , it is still unknown if low - mass stars tend to form later than high - mass stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or if high - mass stars form last , resulting in a rapid termination of star formation ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the age spread of a cluster s stellar population is a good indicator of the overall duration of the star formation process in the cluster .",
    "studies of star - forming regions have reported different results : from a single age , as in ngc 4103 @xcite to age spreads of 2 - 4myr , e.g. , in lh95 @xcite , the orion nebula cluster , w3 main @xcite , and even larger age spreads of tens of myr , like in the pleiades star cluster .",
    "the broad range of age spreads might indicate the existence of different star formation scenarios for different star - forming environments . at the same time , discrepant results on the age spread in individual regions indicate that both observational and theoretical ( e.g. , @xcite ) biases and the overall methodology used to assign ages to individual stars , might also be of importance .",
    "observational difficulties include small number statistics , contamination of samples by field stars , variable extinction and intrinsic infrared excess , unresolved binaries and insufficient characterization of photometric uncertainties originating in varying degrees of crowding .    for our analysis",
    ", we have selected westerlund1 ( wd1 ) and ngc 3603 yc , two of the most populous and massive galactic starburst clusters ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the clusters have half - mass radii of @xmath11 and 0.5pc , respectively .",
    "they are composed of more than 10,000 stars each , a large fraction of which can be resolved individually via ground - based adaptive optics and _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ observations from space .",
    "it is still unclear how such compact clusters have been formed and on which time - scales . for ngc 3603 yc , @xcite suggest a single age of 1myr from isochrone fitting to the pre - main sequence ( pms ) transition region and a single burst of star formation , while @xcite report a 10myr age spread for the pms population , and therefore two distinct episodes of star formation . for wd1 recent studies",
    "give an age in the range 3 - 6myr , and an age spread of less than 1myr .",
    "the latter is based on spectral classification of wd1 s ob supergiant population .",
    "the first step of our method is a proper - motion selection of cluster members on the basis of multi - epoch astrometric observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this enabled us to reject the majority of the contaminating field stars .",
    "next , we apply bayesian analysis to the photometry of cluster members with respect to theoretical isochrones to determine the probability distribution for the age of each member star , given its photometric properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we modified the bayesian method of both by taking into account the cluster membership probability and by adjusting the mass function ( mf ) by a completeness factor .",
    "the posterior probability of the @xmath2-th star with magnitudes @xmath3 to belong to the isochrone of age @xmath4 is    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the initial stellar mass and @xmath7 is the stellar mf with a slope @xmath8 .",
    "the integration region is a `` box '' , i.e. , a rectangular area in color - magnitude ( cm ) space : @xmath9 .",
    "the limits of this area define a mass range which is considered during integration . this box has been chosen in order to exclude field star contaminants based on their colors . to account for residual field star contamination ,",
    "the first multiplier inside the integral is defined as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the probability of a star to be a cluster member and @xmath12 is the probability to be a field star.from the normalization conditions @xmath13 @xmath14 we derive the probability that a cluster member or field star is found in a given position on the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) as @xmath15 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the photometric uncertainties of star@xmath2 and @xmath18 are the magnitudes of the theoretical isochrone , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the mf @xmath7 was modified by @xmath21 to include source incompleteness and has the following form : @xmath22 where b was derived from the normalization condition @xmath23 and @xmath21 from completeness simulations ( see section  [ sec : completeness ] ) .    by multiplying the individual age distributions ,",
    "we obtain the global probability function for the cluster s age @xmath4:@xmath24",
    "near - infrared adaptive optics observations of the central region of wd1 were carried out in 2003 april , using naco at the very large telescope ( vlt ) . @xmath25",
    "observations with a plate scale of 27 mas / pixel and a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath26 ( corresponding to 0.5pc@xmath270.5pc at 4.0kpc distance ; @xcite ) were centered on r.a.@xmath28 , decl.@xmath29 . @xmath25 frames with integration times of 1minute",
    "were co - added , resulting in a total integration time of 5 minutes .    in 2010 august ( epoch difference 7.3yr ) , wd1 was observed with the _ hst _ wide field camera3 ( wfc3/ir ) in the f125w band with a plate scale of 130 mas / pixel .",
    "the final image consists of seven individual exposures with small ( @xmath3010 ) offsets to compensate for bad pixels , with a total integration time of 2444s .",

    "( 2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "positions and magnitudes of the stars were determined using daophot @xcite .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were calibrated against two micron all sky survey , using suitable stars identified on the ntt / sofi data from the work by @xcite as secondary photometric standards . to align the two data sets , identical bright stars with a high probability of being cluster members were identified .",
    "the geometric transformation of the naco pixel coordinates to the wfc3/ir system was based on fitting third - order polynomials with cross - terms in _ x _ and _",
    "y_. for bright stars with @xmath32 mag this resulted in an rms of @xmath10.036 wfc3/ir pixel ( @xmath14.6mas ) for the astrometric offset between the wfc3/ir coordinates and the transformed naco coordinates .",

    "hst_/vlt data set for wd1 is limited by the detection sensitivity in the @xmath33 band ( f125w ) , the completeness simulation was carried out only for the wfc3/ir data .",
    "completeness simulations were done for the magnitude range @xmath34 from 14.0 to 23.0mag . for each simulation",
    ", 25 artificial stars were added at random positions in the image , the image was then analyzed using daophot , and the position and magnitude of the recovered stars recorded .",
    "this procedure was repeated 1600 times , i.e.  encompassing 40,000 artificial stars in total .",
    "the recovery fractions were determined following the steps outlined by @xcite .",
    "we calculated the average completeness for the wfc3/ir area overlapping with the naco frame as a function of @xmath34 and fitted this by a fermi function @xmath35 .",
    "completeness simulations for ngc3603yc were done for f555w .",
    "ten artificial stars were added at each of 50 runs , in total 500 stars for each @xmath36 magnitude bin between 16.0 and 23.0mag .",
    "we calculated the average completeness for _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 image as a function of @xmath36 and fitted this by a fermi function .      the main contaminants apparent in cmds of the starburst clusters are dwarf stars in the foreground and giants in the background . due to galactic rotation",
    ", their proper motion is different from that of cluster stars .",
    "velocity dispersions of disk and halo stars are @xmath150km / s to 150km / s @xcite .    for wd1 ( see figure  [ label : ppm ] )",
    ", our selection criterion for the astrometric residual of 5.8 mas corresponds to a proper motion of 0.8 mas / yr in the cluster rest frame ( or 15.2 km / s at a distance of 4.0 kpc ) , which is higher than wd1 s internal velocity dispersion of 2.1 km / s .",
    "such a selection provides an effective discriminant between cluster members and field stars ( see figure  [ label : fig_cmds]a ) .    for ngc3603yc , we used the result of @xcite , which is based on proper motions over an epoch difference of 10.15 years .",
    "the authors calculated cluster membership probabilities as described by @xcite , and considered the stars with probabilities @xmath3790% as cluster members .",
    "the cmd for wd1 is presented in figure  [ label : fig_cmds]a . for our further analysis",
    "we consider only the region with @xmath38mag and @xmath39mag ( red box in figure  [ label : fig_cmds ] ) , which comprises 41 stars with masses in the range from 0.5 to 11.5 @xmath40 .",
    "brighter stars were excluded because of saturation , fainter stars because of lower signal - to - noise ratio and hence larger photometric and astrometric uncertainties .",
    "the sample includes main sequence ( ms ) , pre - ms , and transition region stars , which have terminated their fully - convective hayashi phase and are rapidly moving towards the ms .",
    "the cmd for ngc3603yc ( figure  [ label : fig_cmds]b ) is derived from second epoch observations in f555w and f814w . for the age",

    "overplotted is the best fitting isochrone assuming a particular distance , for a solar metallicity @xmath43=0.015 , calculated from the latest version of franec evolutionary models , adopting a mixing length value of ml@xmath44 .",
    "we supplement the franec models with padova models for masses @xmath45 .",
    "the franec models have been transformed into the observational plane using spectra from atlas9 model atmospheres @xcite . for the analysis",
    ", we used isochrones with 0.1myr spacing , covering an age range from 0.5 to 6myr .",
    "the application of our method ( section  [ sec : method ] ) to wd1 and ngc 3603yc reveals a slight degeneracy between the cluster s distance and age .",
    "since all cluster members should be at virtually the same distance , we can select a set of distances , and then analyze the resulting cluster age and age spread for each particular distance .    in order to evaluate @xmath11 in equation([eq : p(j , k|m , t ) ] ) for wd1 we estimated the density of stars in the cmd regions adjacent to the red box ( figure  [ label : fig_cmds ] , @xmath46mag and @xmath47mag ) , where the stars are apparently non - cluster members .",
    "the extinction value of @xmath48mag was assumed the same for all cluster members .",
    "the extinction law was taken from @xcite .",
    "for the mf slope in equation([eq : mass_funct ] ) we assumed @xmath49 ( where salpeter slope would correspond to 2.3 ) , as derived from near - infrared adaptive optics observations of the central region of wd1 ( n.kudryavtseva et al .",
    ", 2012 , in preparation ) . in order to quantify the photometric error @xmath50 in equation([eq : p(cluster ) ] ) , we used the results of the artificial star experiments to compare the known input magnitudes with output magnitudes recovered by daophot .",
    "a more detailed explanation of the procedure is described in @xcite .",
    "the maximum photometric errors we got are 0.05mag in @xmath25 and 0.18mag in @xmath33 for wd1 , and 0.17mag in both bands of ngc3603yc .",
    "the @xmath51 function we derived from equation([eq : l(t ) ] ) for wd1 at a distance modulus ( dm ) of 13.0mag ( 4.0kpc ) is presented in figure  [ label:6cuts]a .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of a gaussian fitted to @xmath51 ( red line in figure  [ label:6cuts]a ) is 0.4myr . for @xmath52",
    "dm @xmath53mag we got similar result .",
    "the @xmath51 function for ngc3603yc at dm=14.1mag is presented in figure  [ label:3cuts ngc ] .",
    "as contamination by field stars was already significantly reduced by proper motion selection , @xmath11 in equation([eq : p(j , k|m , t ) ] ) was estimated , assuming that cluster members are the stars with cluster membership probabilities @xmath3798% .",
    "the extinction @xmath54mag is in agreement with the results by @xcite and @xcite and the relative extinction relations from @xcite .",
    "we used the same @xmath55 as in @xcite for the mf slope .",
    "the maximum fwhm we derive for ngc 3603yc at @xmath56 dm @xmath57mag is 0.1myr .",
    "in the ideal case of a coeval population , which lies along an isochrone , and has no photometric errors , @xmath51 from equation([eq : l(t ) ] ) would be a dirac delta function .",
    "a number of observational and physical effects are potentially responsible for the @xmath51 broadening . in this section ,",
    "we model these effects in order to estimate the true age spread .      in order to quantify the broadening of @xmath51 due to solely photometric uncertainties we first generated a number of cluster stars along an isochrone of a certain age in the cm space , and added random photometric errors .",
    "random field stars were added to the data set with the same density as derived for real data . for this simulated data set",
    ", we applied the likelihood technique as described in section  [ sec : method ] and got an artificial @xmath51 function ( see figure  [ label:6cuts]b ) . only due to photometric errors",
    "our simulation on 5.0myr population gave an @xmath51 broadening in terms of fwhm equal to 0.25 myr , hence the true age spread for wd1 should be even less than 0.4myr .",
    "there is considerable observational evidence that binary stars might constitute a significant fraction of a cluster population ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as an unresolved binary combines the light of two stars , a binary will result in an offset in brightness by up to @xmath58mag in the cmd compared to a single star . for non - equal mass systems",
    ", there might also be an offset in color .",
    "both cases lead to a broadening of the observed cluster sequence on the actual cmd .    to test how the shape of @xmath51 is affected by unresolved binarity , we generated stars in the cm space in a similar way as described above for photometric errors , but with a 0.75mag shift along the ordinate for 50% of the artificial points",
    ". we choose 50% as the mean value for the binarity fraction , as recent observations at least for massive population of wd1 revealed a high rate ( more than 40% ) of binary stars .",
    "we applied the same bayesian analysis to the simulated stars as to the real data to determine @xmath51 .",
    "the normalized likelihood @xmath51 we obtained after combining the results of 30 simulations on binarity for a 5.0myr population at dm 13.0mag is shown in figure  [ label:6cuts]c .",
    "it is clearly seen that binarity affects the shape of @xmath51 by adding a pronounced wing to the left from the main peak .",
    "hence , a small shoulder toward younger ages from the @xmath51 maximum for wd1 ( figure  [ label:6cuts]a ) could be caused by unresolved binarity .",
    "for young stellar populations with ages @xmath5910myr , ongoing accretion and the accretion history of a star is also of importance . as discussed in , e.g. , @xcite , low - mass objects , which gain mass through ongoing accretion and a non - accreting pms star of the same mass ,",
    "arrive at different positions in a hertzsprung - russell diagram .    for starburst clusters like wd1 and ngc3603yc",
    ", this effect seems to be strongly attenuated due to the presence of very luminous and massive o - type stars in the clusters .",
    "the fast winds and the ionizing radiation from these stars evaporate and remove circumstellar material around the low - mass cluster members , and clean out any remnant molecular gas in the cluster environment on short timescales of a few 10@xmath60yr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this results in very little differential extinction across the starburst cluster , enabling us to constrain stellar properties using broadband photometry ( @xcite ) .      in order to test the ability of our method to detect the real age spreads , we simulated a mixed cluster population with two different ages and assuming random photometric errors .",
    "we repeated this procedure 30 times and calculated the averaged normalized likelihood @xmath51 .",
    "the result for a mixed population with 70% stars of age 5.0myr and 30% stars of age 4.5myr is shown in figure  [ label:6cuts]d .",
    "hence , a bimodal population with an age difference @xmath610.5myr would manifest itself in a prominent secondary peak , but the latter is not revealed in case of wd1 ( see figure  [ label:6cuts]a ) .",
    "our analysis highlights the importance of a good membership selection , background rejection and characterization when analyzing crowded field data .",
    "we emphasize that the photometric component of our analysis only works in young , massive clusters and older clusters with little differential extinction and absence of ongoing accretion .",
    "other environments require detailed spectroscopic analyses to establish precise effective temperatures and luminosities for individual stars , as has been exemplified in the case of onc @xcite and w3main @xcite .",
    "isochrones based on franec and padova evolutionary models , and atlas9 atmospheric models provide a good match to observed cluster sequences in the age range from 1 to 5myr and mass range from 0.6 to 14@xmath62 for solar metallicities . extending the sample of cluster members to lower masses could help to benchmark evolutionary tracks and atmospheric models for young , low - mass stars and quite possibly even brown dwarfs .    our analysis of the photometric sequence of cluster members yields an age spread of less than 0.4myr for the @xmath15.0myr old wd1 and less than 0.1myr for the @xmath12.0myr old ngc3603yc .",
    "this is a strong indication that in both cases the clusters formed in a single event once a sufficient gas mass had been aggregated and compressed to overcome internal thermal , turbulent or magnetic support , and to initiate an avalanche - like star formation event .",
    "this finding seems to be in agreement with theoretical predictions that clusters with masses between @xmath63 and @xmath64 loose their residual gas on a timescale shorter than their crossing times @xcite . for wd1 and ngc3603yc crossing times",
    "have been estimated to be of the order of 0.3myr and 0.03myr @xcite , respectively .",
