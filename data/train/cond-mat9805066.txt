    "in recent years there had been considerable activity , both experimental and theoretical , in the field of critical phenomena of antiferromagnets with heisenberg and rkky interactions @xcite -@xcite .",
    "this increase of interest @xcite-@xcite was stimulated by new experiments in high @xmath0 superconductors and heavy fermion compounds .",
    "in particular , the critical spin fluctuations are supposed to be responsible for non - fermi - liquid low temperature behavior of the heat capacity and resistivity in @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite,@xcite in the vicinity of the quantum critical point . besides , the fermi - type resonating valence bond excitations were introduced by @xcite,@xcite in the framework of the heisenberg model to describe unusual magnetic properties of high @xmath3 cuprates @xcite and ce - based heavy fermion compounds @xcite,@xcite . in this case",
    "the critical spin fluctuations were shown to be important in the spin liquid formation mechanism .",
    "however , the scaling behavior of kinetic coefficients in the presence of spin - liquid fluctuations can be differ significantly from the predictions of the dynamic scaling theory @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a microscopic description of the scaling behavior of spin diffusion and relaxation coefficients in isotropic heisenberg antiferromagnet in the critical region above the neel temperature .",
    "the scaling dimension of kinetic coefficients was predicted by halperin and hohenberg @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they proposed the dynamic scaling hypothesis based on the assumption that the critical exponents of kinetic coefficients are the same on both sides of the phase transition point .",
    "the microscopic treatment of the spin diffusion in the paramagnetic phase of ferromagnet was proposed by s.v.maleev @xcite - @xcite . within the framework of this approach",
    "the approximations which are necessary for validity of the dynamic scaling hypothesis were established and momentum and frequency dependence of the spin diffusion coefficient was analyzed .",
    "we will follow maleev s approach to derive the scaling behavior of kinetic coefficients for heisenberg antiferromagnet .    the qualitative picture of the critical phenomena expressed in terms of wave number @xmath4 and inverse coherence length @xmath5 is well known @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there are two regions : `` hydrodynamic '' regime deals with the longitudinal fluctuations @xmath6 of the order parameter - the staggered magnetization @xmath7 and `` critical '' one considers the fluctuations with @xmath8 ( the momentum @xmath9 corresponds to small deviation of the momentum from the af vector ) .",
    "however , there is an additional conserved quantity in afm which is the total magnetization @xmath10 .",
    "the fluctuations of this parameter do not lead to any singularities in spin correlators .",
    "nevertheless , there is a region of longitudinal fluctuations of @xmath11 @xmath12 which is also can be called as `` hydrodynamic '' .",
    "the goal of our work is to investigate the spin correlation functions behavior in the paramagnetic phase of af and to establish the relations between the kinetic coefficients in two fluctuation regions of the phase diagram .",
    "the dynamic of magnetization fluctuations is described by the van hove microscopic diffusion equation in the long wave limit @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spin diffusion coefficient .",
    "this equation is derived from the conservation low for the total magnetic moment , since the operator @xmath15 commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "the fluctuation behavior of nonconserved order parameter is radically different .",
    "according to the general postulates of the thermodynamics of weakly nonequilibrium processes @xcite the rate of change @xmath16 is proportional to the conjugate thermodynamical force @xmath17 here @xmath18 - is the static susceptibility , and the kinetic coefficient @xmath19 satisfies the condition @xmath20 .",
    "the relaxation function determined by the equation ( [ 0.1 ] ) is nearly uniform , therefore the gradient terms for relaxation processes are omitted .",
    "in contrast to relaxation the first nonzero contribution to the spin diffusion equation is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "although the average value of @xmath15 is equal to zero on the both sides of the phase transition , the fluctuations of total magnetization around zero take place .",
    "however , unlike the fm case the diffusion mode is not the `` critical '' mode for af transition .",
    "thus , we are interested in the dynamical susceptibility of a cubic heisenberg antiferromagnet in zero magnetic field above the neel temperature , @xmath22 and the dipolar interaction @xcite is neglected . as is known the susceptibility",
    "is related to the retarded green s function by the following equality : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is lande splitting factor , @xmath25 is bohr magneton and @xmath26 > , \\label{0.4}\\ ] ]    @xmath27    @xmath28 using the equations ( [ 0.1 ] , [ 0.2 ] ) one can obtain an expression for the retarded green functions in the fluctuation region in the following form : @xmath29 @xmath30 here @xmath18 is the static spin correlation function . the equations ( [ 0.5 ] , [ 0.6 ] )",
    "correspond to diffusion and relaxation regimes respectively .    when @xmath31 ( @xmath32 is the ginzburg number which characterizes the conditions when the landau theory is valid ) the fluctuations become important .",
    "the dynamic properties in this region can be described by halperin - hohenberg scaling hypothesis . according to this theory the equation for the dynamic susceptibility",
    "can be expressed in terms of the scaling function @xmath33 : @xmath34 thus , the dynamic critical exponent @xmath35 , which characterizes the critical fluctuations energy scale @xmath36 , is connected with the static critical exponent @xmath37 defined by the expression @xmath38 .",
    "we assume the static behavior of susceptibility in the form @xmath39 .",
    "we also neglect the fisher index @xmath40 which determines the `` anomalous dimension '' @xcite .",
    "this approximation is valid in 3d case @xcite . to derive the scaling properties of af one have to introduce two types of the scaling functions : @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath43 in principal , expressions ( [ 0.7 ] , [ 0.8 ] ) determine the kinetic coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath19 in terms of coherence length .",
    "moreover , the renormalization group analyses @xcite,@xcite has shown that the kinetic coefficients are singular in the fluctuation region of af .    the theory under consideration is a variant of the mode - mode coupling theory proposed by kawasaki @xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite ) . we extend to af systems the dynamic scaling method offered by maleev for ferromagnets . as was mentioned above , the aim of our paper is to derive the scaling behavior and momentum and frequency dependence of @xmath44 functions in the fluctuation region of af .",
    "assumptions which are crucial for the microscopic substantiations of dynamic scaling hypothesis will be also formulated .",
    "we consider the dynamic susceptibility of cubic heisenberg antiferromagnet in the fluctuation region above the neel temperature . the equations ( [ 0.5 ] , [ 0.6 ] )",
    "can be rewritten in more general form : @xmath45 there is a simple expression for the spin - diffusion coefficient in the hydrodynamical regime @xmath46 the generalized kinetic coefficient in the relaxation region is @xmath47 .",
    "the different limits @xmath48 in the expressions ( [ 0.5 ] , [ 0.6 ] ) significantly depend on the relations between @xmath4 and @xmath49 .",
    "these limits are completely analogous to those considered in the fermi liquid theory @xcite . in the treatment",
    "below we consider the the quasistatic limit of @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "as it was shown by maleev , it is possible to determine the kinetic coefficients in terms of the kubo functions for the operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56,\\ ] ] @xmath57>.\\ ] ] the formal expression ( [ 1.3 ] ) is exact , and it takes into account the nonlinear character of the relaxation forces . in the case of purely exchange interaction , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the kubo function in the denominator vanishes at @xmath60 , and we arrive at the expression @xmath61 .",
    "however , in studying the dispersion of the kinetic coefficients , i.e. its dependence on @xmath4 , @xmath49 , we can not , generally speaking , neglect this function in the denominator .    using the properties of spin operators",
    ", it is not difficult to obtain the relations between different retarded spin green s functions @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the paramagnetic phase .",

    "( [ 1.6 ] ) , we have confined ourselves to the lowest terms of the expansion in powers of @xmath71 and have put @xmath72 , where @xmath73 . since , we are interested in the correction terms of order @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; we consistently neglect the @xmath76 and @xmath77 corrections , because @xmath78 .",
    "thus the problem of derivation of the kinetic coefficients is reduced to the analysis of four - spin correlators with current vertices .",
    "the later problem can be solved by analytical continuation of the temperature feynman s diagram to the upper half - plane of complex variable @xmath49 the feynman diagrams corresponding to the spin - current correlation function are shown on figure 1 .",
    "the `` bare '' poles of the green s functions ( [ 0.5 ] , [ 0.6 ] ) lie on imaginary axis . introducing fictitious quasi - particles `` diffusons '' and `` relaxons ''",
    "we obtain the self - consistent equations for kinetic coefficients and determine their scaling dimensions .",
    "the static susceptibility in the fluctuation region obeys the ornstein - zernike law @xmath79 ( here a is a constant ( @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 ) .",
    "there is no singularities of static susceptibility in the diffusion region @xmath12 , where @xmath82 .    in sec .",
    "iii the relations between kinetic coefficients are established and scaling dimensions of kinetic coefficient are analyzed .",
    "iv is devoted to a momentum and frequency dependence of spin diffusion and spin relaxation constants .",
    "we begin with analyzing the set of diagrams which can not be separated into two parts by cutting one line of interaction , and include these diagrams into the irreducible self - energy part of the spin - current correlation function . using the definition of @xmath83 and properties of the functions",
    "@xmath84 we obtain an expression for generalized kinetic coefficient in terms of irreducible self - energy parts : @xmath85 [ 1+g_0^{-1}\\frac{{\\cal r}^r_{\\dot{s}s}({\\bf k},\\omega)\\gamma({\\bf   k},\\omega ) } { i\\omega(-i\\omega + g_0^{-1}(k)\\gamma({\\bf k},\\omega))}]^{-1 } \\label{2.1}\\ ] ] the equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) can be derived both from analysis of diagrammatic series for the spin - current correlators @xcite , and directly from larkin equation @xcite,@xcite .",
    "below we use the following notations for retarded spin green s functions : @xmath86 , and @xmath87 - are the irreducible self - energies . to obtain the graphical representation for the irreducible part @xmath88 one have to replace the",
    "`` dressed '' vertex in fig.1 by the irreducible one .",
    "the estimation of @xmath89 in the framework of mean - field theory @xcite , @xcite results in : @xmath90    moreover , due to analytical properties of spin correlators , @xmath91 .",
    "we assume that the expression for @xmath89 contains the small parameter @xmath92 in a limit of small @xmath49 not only in critical region and neglect this contribution below .",
    "therefore , the generalized kinetic coefficient @xmath83 can be rewritten in terms of irreducible self - energies only : @xmath93 the general set of diagrams for the irreducible self - energy part @xmath94 in imaginary time can be classified by the number of intermediate states .",
    "first , we confine ourselves to the diagrams with two - particles intermediate states ( fig.2 ) @xmath95 @xmath96 replacing the sum over momentum @xmath97 by the integration one should use the `` cutoff '' @xmath98 as an upper limit of integration .",
    "this means that the integrations are restricted by the region close to the appropriate singularities ( small @xmath97 and small @xmath99 for @xmath100 in the vicinity of af vector @xmath101 ) . from the point of view of the energy dependence , the vertices @xmath102 being the three - point functions are the analytical functions of all three frequencies @xmath49 and , in each of the frequencies they have a cut along the real axis ; they have no singularities in the physical region of variables @xmath49 @xcite . due to these properties it is possible to separate the vertex into a static part and dynamic contribution , disappearing in the limit @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "we concentrate below on the static vertex .    as it can be seen from the fig.2(a )",
    ", the static vertices correspond to the longitudinal processes of `` diffuson '' - `` diffuson '' or `` relaxon''- relaxon \" pair creation and annihilation , since in this case only the modes of the same origin couple together . on the other hand , the static green function @xmath104 is not sensitive to the direction of the momentum . in the other words ,",
    "the corresponding lines in the diagrams are not directed .",
    "for this reason , the processes of diffuson and relaxon scattering contain the same vertices as the processes of pair creation and annihilation .",
    "however , for such a scattering processes in the limit @xmath105 the ward identity holds @xcite,@xcite ( fig.3 ) : @xmath106 as was mentioned , the region of integration in the second term is concentrated near the points @xmath107 . the contribution from the staggered magnetization fluctuations into the spin diffusion can be calculated by means of the substitution @xmath108 and , by use of the property @xmath109 .",
    "let us consider the diagram fig.2(b ) .",
    "the external momentum of this diagram can be taken equal to @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , we have two different coupling modes , `` diffuson '' and `` relaxon '' .",
    "thus , this diagram corresponds to the process of `` diffuson '' - `` relaxon '' pair creation . for this reason we can not use the ward identity to analyze this contribution",
    "however , the `` bare '' vertex ( fig.3 ) has the scaling dimension @xmath111 besides , in the magnetic brillouin zone the points 0 and @xmath112 are equivalent .",
    "taking into account the direction independence of interacting modes in fluctuating region one can assume that the processes of multiple scattering on the static fields do not influence the scaling dimension of the static vertex .",
    "using the properties of vertices it is not difficult to perform the summation over @xmath113 and the analytical continuation in @xmath49 @xcite . as a result",

    "the equations generalize the corresponding equation ( [ 2.6 ] ) are obtained by maleev @xcite for ferromagnets . in that case",
    "it is possible to retain only the first term in expression ( [ 2.5 ] ) , since one deals with a single mode regime",
    ". equations ( [ 2.5],[2.6 ] ) can be rewritten in a different form .",
    "taking @xmath117 and @xmath118 and integrating by parts over @xmath113 one can obtain the following result : @xmath119 \\label{2.7}\\ ] ]    @xmath120    these expressions are in fact a generalization of equations derived by maleev @xcite for the case of two coupling modes .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the main contribution to the integrals ( [ 2.5],[2.6 ] ) appears from the vicinity of scaling functions singularities ( [ 0.8 ] ) .",
    "besides , the characteristic energies of critical fluctuations satisfy the condition @xmath121 due to the `` critical slowing down '' .",
    "thus , we can replace the hyperbolic functions ( [ 2.5 ] -[2.7 ] ) by their arguments . calculating integrals over the frequencies and extracting the scaling dimension of kinetic coefficients we obtain the relation between spin diffusion coefficient and the relaxation constant .",
    "@xmath122 it is interesting to note that the expressions ( [ 2.9 ] ) can be derived by direct substitution of retarded green functions ( [ 0.5],[0.6 ] ) to the expressions ( [ 2.5],[2.7 ] ) . after integration over the frequencies we obtain the equations on kinetic coefficients which contain only integration over momentum of the different powers of the static correlator @xmath18 . as a result",
    "the first term is determined by the two - diffuson intermediate state and the second term corresponds to two - relaxon intermediate state .",
    "the integrals ( [ 2.6 ] - [ 2.8 ] ) can be calculated in the same way .",

    "solution of self - consistent system of _ algebraic _ equations leads to following scaling dimension of kinetic coefficient ] @xmath125 behavior of kinetic coefficient agrees with predictions of dynamic scaling theory @xcite-@xcite and with renormalization group analysis @xcite@xcite .",
    "therefore , the kinetic coefficients of af are singular in fluctuating region , and spin diffusion is determined by the intermediate relaxation processes . a correction in ( [ 2.7 ] )",
    "corresponding to the influence of self - diffusion is proportional to @xmath126 .",
    "hence , these processes can be omitted in the critical region .",
    "calculation of dynamic critical exponent z ( see eq.[0.7 ] ) results in @xmath127 .",

    "the characteristic length scale of the ordered regions is @xmath129 .",
    "the excitations in these regions are the af magnons with sound like dispersion law .",
    "estimations of the spin diffusion coefficient results in @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is a characteristic diffusion time and @xmath132 is a `` sound '' velocity @xcite , therefore @xmath133 . due to the dynamic scaling hypothesis which postulates the invariance of the dynamic scaling exponent @xmath35 ,",
    "the characteristic scaling behavior of relaxation constant is @xmath134 .",
    "although the kinetic coefficients are singular , the characteristic relaxation times of staggered magnetization and spin diffusion become infinite .",
    "this result guarantees the existence of macroscopic ordered regions , corresponding to the partial equilibrium of the system @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that we did not use any assumptions about the elementary excitations spectrum in ordered phase when deriving the expressions ( [ 2.9 ] ) .",
    "our study is based only on a concept of total magnetization conservation and order parameter non - conservation .",
    "here we study the kinetic coefficient as a functions of finite but small @xmath135 and @xmath49 . for this sake",
    "we use the relations between spin correlation functions ( [ 1.3 ] ) and kubo functions ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the corrections due to momentum and frequency dependence of kinetic coefficient are determined both by the nonlinear character of the relaxation forces and the momentum and frequency dependence of irreducible self - energy parts . according to the estimation ( [ 2.1a ] )",
    "one can derive the frequency and momentum dependence of spin diffusion and relaxation constants only in terms of linear response theory .",
    "therefore , we can neglect the nonlinear character of relaxation forces .    first , we consider the static renormalizations of kinetic coefficients .",

    "the diffusion and relaxation picture in this region becomes very complicated and scarcely amenable to detailed analysis at the present time .",
    "for this reason we shall neglect the irregular corrections to kinetic coefficients resulting from the generation of poles chain and drift of the poles toward the new cut @xcite,@xcite . in the region of @xmath135 , @xmath49 under consideration , all these singularities are small corrections , and therefore , the phenomena associated with them are no special interest .",
    "now we turn to discussion of the role of many - particles @xmath162 intermediate states .",
    "as it was mentioned above , we are interested only in regular contributions of such diagrams to the kinetic coefficients : @xmath163    @xmath164    here the functions @xmath84 correspond both to `` diffusons '' and `` relaxons '' .",

    "besides , the vertices of static scaling theory are proved to give the main contribution to quasiparticles scattering processes .    the momentum and frequency dependence of spin diffusion and relaxation coefficients is found in the `` pole '' approximation .",
    "a definition of the generalized effective coefficient is introduced in a full analogy with that used in the theory of quantum liquids for a definition of effective mass .",
