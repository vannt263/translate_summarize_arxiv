    "x - ray and optical techniques for detecting clusters of galaxies each have their merits .",
    "optical techniques have been in use for over four decades , and images of the optical sky are relatively inexpensive to obtain .",
    "new optical methods such as the matched - filter method ( postman et al .",
    "1996 , p96 hereafter ) have allowed for automatic , uniform detection of optical overdensities of galaxies with magnitude distributions consistent with those of a typical cluster of galaxies . in the matched - filter method ,",
    "fitting galaxy luminosity functions in addition to seeking overdensities of galaxies minimizes the projection effects that plagued earlier cluster cataloguing efforts .",
    "x - ray selection has the advantage of directly revealing the hot intracluster medium confined by the deep gravitational potential of the cluster . since this emission is proportional to the gas density squared , and the x - ray sky is sparsely populated compared to the optical , x - ray detections have higher contrast and less contamination from physically unrelated systems .",
    "early x - ray selection methods optimal for point sources ( gioia et al .",
    "1990b ) were biased somewhat towards selecting clusters with high central surface brightneses , but there are now several algorithms optimized for detecting extended sources , including wavelets and voronoi - tesselation percolation methods ( rosati et al .",
    "1995 ; scharf et al . 1997 ) .",
    "however , x - ray and optical studies of cluster evolution have progressed along separate paths . a decade ago , optical and x - ray surveys disagreed in their assessment of the amount of evolution clusters have experienced .",
    "optical surveys indicated very little evolution since @xmath5 ( gunn , hoessel & oke 1986 ) while x - ray studies suggested modest ( gioia et al .",
    "1990a ) to strong evolution ( edge et al .",
    "1990 , later retracted in ebeling et al .",
    "the most recent x - ray samples of clusters over a range of redshifts out to @xmath6 suggest that the x - ray luminosity function for moderate luminosity clusters has in fact not evolved significantly since @xmath7 ( borgani et al .",
    "1999 ; nichol et al . 1999 ; rosati et al .",
    "1998 ; jones et al . 1998 ) , while the _ most luminous _ ( and presumably most massive ) systems , such as those contained in the emss , may have evolved somewhat ( gioia et al .",
    "1990a ; henry et al .",
    "1992 ; nichol et al .",
    "1997 , vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; rosati et al .",
    "2000 ; gioia et al .",
    "2001 ) , but the community is not unanimous on this result ( e.g. jones et al .",
    "in contrast , recent optical surveys for distant clusters continue to find very little evidence for evolution ( couch et al .",
    "1991 ; p96 ) .    in an effort to establish the common ground between x - ray and optical studies of clusters and cluster evolution ,",
    "we have undertaken a joint x - ray / optical survey to detect and study clusters of galaxies , called the rosat optical x - ray survey , or roxs .",
    "in contrast to other rosat pspc serendipitous surveys ( e.g. rosati et al .",
    "1995 , jones et al .",
    "1998 , romer et al .",
    "2000 , vikhlinin et al . 1998 ) , the roxs team optically imaged the entire central 30 by 30 of each field in our survey .",
    "the x - ray selection and optical selection of cluster candidates were then determined independently . in this current work ,",
    "we report results on the relation between the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 , a measure of the cluster s optical luminosity .",
    "the roxs has already been used to find a potential intergalactic x - ray filament ( scharf et al .",
    "paper ii ( donahue et al . , 2001 ) contains the catalogues , data reduction and observational details . for this paper",
    "we scale @xmath10 km / s / mpc .",
    "we assume @xmath11 to ease comparison with earlier results .",
    "we obtained the optical images with the prime focus camera t2 kb at the kitt peak national observatory 4-meter telescope march , 1996 and may , 1997 .",
    "the 23 roxs target fields were selected from a sample of archival rosat pspc observations with exposure times of more than 8,000 seconds and galactic latitude of @xmath12 degrees .",
    "four 900-second , 16 by 16 exposures were obtained through the i - band filter , to tile the central 30 by 30 of each rosat field .",
    "our 5@xmath13 detection limit of @xmath14 was sufficient to detect cluster galaxies 2 magnitudes fainter than the typical unevolved first - ranked elliptical at @xmath15 ( postman et al .",
    "we constructed galaxy catalogs which were in turn used to build the optical cluster catalog .",
    "the matched filter method ( p96 ) , tuned to redshifts in the range @xmath16 , was used to generate cluster catalogs in @xmath17 intervals .",
    "each cluster candidate is assigned a central position , radius ( corresponding to the area of detection @xmath18 ) , an estimated redshift , and a a detection confidence ( in units of @xmath13 ) .",
    "the algorithm also estimates an effective optical luminosity @xmath9 , which is the equivalent number of @xmath19 galaxies in the cluster such that the optical cluster luminosity in units of solar luminosities is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 in the i band ( p96 ) and @xmath22 is the absolute magnitude of the sun .",
    "a k - correction is applied assuming a standard elliptical spectrum . for reference",
    ", a richness class 1 cluster at @xmath23 has @xmath24 in the i - band ( p96 ) .",
    "additional details regarding field selection , data reduction , and catalog construction for the galaxies and optical cluster candidates can be found in paper ii .",
    "we defined 155 optical cluster candidates in 23 30 by 30 fields , of which 142 satisfy a @xmath25 criterion .",
    "we computed a @xmath26 x - ray flux detection threshold within an aperture of @xmath27 centered on each optical candidate .",
    "we also computed the x - ray and optical selection functions for the survey ( p96 , paper ii ) .",
    "a wavelet - based technique , described by rosati et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , was used to create a catalog of x - ray clusters of galaxy candidates for each field observed at kitt peak .",
    "several of these fields overlapped with the orginal rdcs ( rosati et al .",
    "1995 ) sample , and thus the x - ray cluster candidates in many of the fields already have been confirmed and have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the flux limits are approximately the same as those of the rdcs ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "fifty - seven x - ray candidate clusters and their associated x - ray parameters were found .    in order to define the optical / x - ray cross identifications we compared locations and contours of x - ray sources to contour maps of optical significance overlaid on the i - band image . of the 57 x - ray candidates , 43 were located within our optical field of view and unobscured by scattered light or bright stars . of the 43 , 31 were visually identified with potential cluster candidates with @xmath29 , of which 26 are very secure , with centroid separations of @xmath30 . of the other 5 , 3 are low - significance optical clusters ( @xmath31 ) which were interesting because of their potentially high redshift , and two others are more distant affiliations of sprawling optical systems with a compact x - ray candidate . the remaining 12 x - ray cluster candidates can be divided into 4 _ bona - fide _ optically faint candidates , 6 candidates with very uncertain x - ray fluxes ( @xmath32 ) , one double source ( likely to be two blended point sources ) , and one blend with the original rosat target .",
    "none of the optically - blank x - ray sources have yet been classified or confirmed at other wavelengths . since the spurious fraction typical of the x - ray surveys is @xmath33 ( rosati et al .",
    "1998 ; vikhlinin et al 1998 ) , @xmath34 of these sources are likely to be spurious or collections of point sources",
    ". some of these candidates may be _ bonafide _ , albeit optically faint , high - redshift clusters .",
    "near ir imaging might reveal such clusters .",
    "ten x - ray candidates have confirmed spectroscopic redshifts ; eight of these have estimated redshifts from the optical data that lie within @xmath35 of the spectroscopic redshift ( paper ii ) . of the 142 optically selected candidates with @xmath25 , 27 have x - ray counterparts ( one has two counterparts ) .",
    "up to 29 additional optical candidates have possible x - ray point - source counterparts within @xmath36 which we do not use in our correlation analysis .",
    "for a cluster in which mass traces optical light ( @xmath37 is constant ) and the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( @xmath38 ) , and @xmath39 ( empirical relation see e.g. david et al .",
    "1993 ) , we expect the x - ray luminosity to be related to the optical luminosity as @xmath40 .",
    "the empirical relationship between a cluster s x - ray luminosity and optical luminosity is not so well defined , in large part due to the difficulties inherent in measuring a cluster s optical luminosity and in getting a homogeneous set of total optical luminosities for a large number of clusters .",
    "edge & stewart ( 1991 ) found that the bolometric x - ray luminosity of a local sample of x - ray selected clusters correlated only very roughly with abell number and somewhat better with bahcall galaxy density ( number of bright galaxies within @xmath41 mpc ; 1977 ; 1981 ) for the smaller subsample ( 18 ) that had bahcall galaxy densities .",
    "arnaud et al.(1992 ) made a heroic effort to compute cluster optical luminosities at low redshift from a heterogeneous literature .",
    "the more systematic matched filter algorithm ( p96 ) produces @xmath9 , which is proportional to the estimated optical luminosity inside @xmath42  mpc .",
    "we plot the the relationship between bolometric @xmath8 ( in units of @xmath43 ) and @xmath9 for our sample of clusters of galaxies in figure  [ lx_lambda ] , including the @xmath26 upper limits for clusters for which there was no x - ray counterpart .",
    "we tested the relationship between @xmath8 , @xmath9 and estimated @xmath44 , including the upper limits for @xmath8 , with a statistical procedure by akritas & siebert ( 1996 ) and kembhavi , feigelson , & singh ( 1986 ) to test for partial correlation in the presence of censored data .",
    "our aim was to see if @xmath8 and @xmath9 were indeed correlated beyond the effect of @xmath44 estimates on flux - limited surveys .",
    "we found that while the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath44 is fairly strong , with a kendall @xmath45-coefficient of 0.6 , the correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath44 is not nearly as strong , @xmath46 , and the partial correlation of all 3 quantities is significant at the 95% level ( partial @xmath47 ) .",
    "the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath9 is @xmath48 ( the same @xmath49 for all @xmath45 , kembhavi et al .",
    "1986 ) , and thus @xmath8 and @xmath9 are correlated at the @xmath50 level .",
    "we roughly fit a correlation of @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , to the cross - identified x - ray / optical clusters using a method of bivariated correlated errors and scatter ( akritas & bershady 1996 ) with bootstrap estimate of the variance , including intrinsic scatter .",
    "this fit is by no means a unique fit to the data , but it suits our purposes for the next discussion .",
    "the fit and scatter are also consistent with the upper limits , which are well mixed with the detections .",
    "the intrinsic scatter in the relation and the fit is significant .",
    "we can compute the observed `` @xmath9-function '' for these data from the estimates of @xmath9 , the selection function ( a function of @xmath9 and redshift ) , and the effective sky coverage of the survey ( 4.84 square degrees ) . the maximum search volume as a function of @xmath9",
    "is estimated for each cluster .",
    "( for details , see paper ii . ) for a given @xmath9 , the @xmath53 is the sum over all @xmath54 for which @xmath55 .",
    "we plot the differential function in figure  [ diff_fn ] , binned such that each bin but the highest contains 9 clusters .",
    "this function is consistent with that derived from the much larger sample in the deeprange survey ( postman et al , in preparation . )",
    "we obtain a raw estimate of @xmath56 at @xmath57 of @xmath58 mpc@xmath59 , and @xmath60 of @xmath61 mpc@xmath59 .",
    "the estimated value is consistent with the value for the postman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) survey at the same @xmath9 , ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the best fit differential @xmath9 function ( @xmath2 , @xmath11 ) is of the form : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the uncertainties here do not take into account the uncertainties on the survey volume , @xmath9 , or spurious fraction .",
    "each ( @xmath9 , @xmath44 ) data point is weighted equally in the fit and the influence of the spurious fraction is minimized by fitting only those 134 cluster candidates with @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "are the optical cluster candidates without x - ray counterparts spurious , real but x - ray faint clusters , or the high @xmath9-tail of the more numerous low - mass , low-@xmath8 x - ray clusters ?",
    "we know already from spectroscopic followup of similar matched filter surveys that these clusters can not all be spurious ( holden , et al .",
    "1999 ; adami et al 2000 ; postman , lubin & oke 1998 ) .",
    "we compare the @xmath9 function to the x - ray luminosity function ( xlf ) for @xmath68 kev of the x - ray clusters of galaxies from the brightest cluster survey ( ebeling et al .",
    "1997 ) in order to answer this question .",
    "a chain - rule conversion of the xlf to a @xmath9 function using the @xmath1 relation fit in  3 produces a @xmath9 function significantly flatter than the observed @xmath9 function ( figure  [ diff_fn ] ) .",
    "if we simultaneously fit _ both _ the @xmath9 distribution function and the @xmath1 relation , we obtain a steeper relation where @xmath69 , where the best - fit values of the slope and normalization are highly correlated .",
    "this relation , when used to convert the xlf to the @xmath9 function , results in a steeper @xmath9 function .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of a gaussian distribution in @xmath9 with respect to @xmath8 for the inferred @xmath9 function .",
    "the qualitative effect of scatter is to change the normalization but not the slope of the @xmath9 function .",
    "the optical matched filter method detected many more cluster candidates than did the x - ray method , at threshholds optimal for maximizing the number of cross - correlated sources ( paper ii ) .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that at least one of the following three assumptions is false : ( a ) @xmath70 , ( b ) that we have accurately estimated the @xmath9 distribution function from the present dataset , and/or ( c ) that the x - ray luminosity function is accurately known .",
    "of these three , ( c ) is most likely to be true , as several groups have obtained compatible results .",
    "the assumption ( b ) can be confirmed by an independent matched - filter survey ( deeprange , postman et al .",
    "1998 ) . so",
    "( a ) is the most likely weak link .",
    "our results are consistent with the hypothesis that all of the optical cluster candidates with @xmath71 are true clusters , as long as the true @xmath1 relation is rather steep ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we do not need to assume that the optical candidates not detected in x - rays are x - ray faint yet massive clusters to explain our results here .",
    "however , if the @xmath1 relation is indeed steeper than @xmath73 and @xmath9 is directly proportional to @xmath74 , this result implies that the mass to light ratio of clusters continues to increase with the mass of the cluster , at least into the moderate mass range explored in our sample .",
    "we note that our survey is too small to include the most massive clusters , and our estimates of @xmath8 and @xmath74 are confined to the central few arcminutes of each candidate . if @xmath75 at these mass scales , @xmath76 for the range of cluster masses in our survey ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this weak dependence of @xmath78 on mass is not ruled out by existing data ( e.g. hradecky et al . 2000 . )",
    "followup with weak lensing measurements , near - ir , and x - ray observations are essential",
    ". if the clusters are low - mass , the clusters with high @xmath9 but low @xmath8 will have commensurately low x - ray temperatures .",
    "roxs identifies optically rich examples of cluster candidates without extended x - ray counterparts for the assessment of the possible existence of optically bright but x - ray faint clusters of galaxies .",
    "we have directly compared the results of cluster hunting with two competing methods : optical selection in the i - band , using the matched filter technique , and x - ray selection of extended sources .",
    "we have found that both methods reliably detect most of the richest , and presumably most massive systems , but the optical matched filter technique , because of the scatter and the steepness of the relation between x - ray and optical luminosities , produces more cluster candidates at our sensitivities .",
    "we present the first @xmath9 function for optically - selected clusters of galaxies .",
    "the @xmath9 function is consistent with the x - ray luminosity function for clusters of galaxies if the intrinsic , global @xmath79 relation is consistent with that of the cross - identified candidates . in particular , we can explain our observations without appealing to an x - ray faint population of massive clusters of galaxies .",
    "predictions for an observational test using deep xmm - newton / epic exposures based on our result are : ( 1 ) x - ray observations of the undetected , high-@xmath9 systems should detect x - rays from most of the systems with observations of only moderately increased sensitivity over the rosat observations , and the detected icm will not be hot ( @xmath80 kev ) .",
    "( 2 ) if @xmath81 , the median predicted bolometric x - ray luminosity for the entire undetected sample is @xmath82 erg s@xmath3 , so that deep xmm - newton epic exposures should detect most of this population . on",
    "the other hand , significant numbers of non - detections with xmm will suggest that many of these clusters are spurious or are significantly less massive than their estimated richnesses may suggest or that there is an x - ray faint population at these mass scales . ( 3 ) the x - ray candidates which are not detected by the matched filter algorithm in the optical images will be revealed to be either false clusters of galaxies ( constellations of agn ) , moderately distant groups , or distant clusters of galaxies ( @xmath83 ) .",
