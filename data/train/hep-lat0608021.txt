    "for some time now it has been possible to explore the structure of hadrons from first principles using lattice qcd .",
    "since the pion is the lightest qcd bound state and plays a central role in chiral symmetry breaking and in low - energy dynamics , a thorough investigation of its internal structure in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom should be particularly interesting .",
    "we have started to explore the structure of the pion in a framework using generalised parton distributions , or more precisely their moments @xcite . as a generalisation of parton distributions and form factors",
    "they contain both as limiting cases . in this work",
    "we restrict ourselves to results for the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath2 from @xmath3 lattice qcd simulations , based on @xmath0 improved wilson fermions and wilson glue .",
    "initial studies on the pion form factor by martinelli _",
    "et al . _ and draper _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite were followed by recent simulations in quenched @xcite and unquenched qcd @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we improve upon previous calculations by extracting the pion form factor for a much larger number of @xmath4 , @xmath5 combinations , which allows us to study both the chiral and the continuum limit .",
    "furthermore , two finite size runs make estimates of the volume effect possible .",
    "the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath2 describes how the vector current @xmath6 couples to the pion .",
    "writing @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the incoming and outgoing momenta of the pion , it is defined by @xmath9 where the momentum transfer is @xmath10 and its invariant square is @xmath11 .    for our lattice calculation",
    "we want to simplify the flavour structure of eq .  .",
    "invoking isospin symmetry one finds @xmath12 it is hence sufficient to limit the calculation to a single quark flavour in the vector operator .",
    "we use the unimproved local vector current on the lattice ; the corrections due to the improvement term @xcite are quite small and will be discussed later . since this current is not conserved , renormalisation has to be taken into account .",
    "because in the forward limit ( @xmath13 ) the form factor is simply the electric charge of the pion , we can normalise our data appropriately .",
    "we can also use the known renormalisation constant @xmath14 ( taken for example from @xcite ) as a cross - check for our simulation .    to compute the matrix elements in eq .   on the lattice ,",
    "one has to evaluate pion three - point and two - point functions .",
    "we then apply a standard procedure to extract the pion form factor @xmath2 , where one constructs an appropriate ratio for the observable @xcite .",
    "let us start by looking at the three - point function .",
    "the general form is given by the correlation function @xmath15 and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3pt ] . here",
    "we denote the sink and source operators for a pion with given momentum and at given time - slice by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . using the transfer matrix formalism and inserting complete sets of energy eigenstates , the three - point function is then of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the time extent of our lattice and @xmath20 note that we have omitted excited states in eq .   and already inserted our choice for the time - slice of the pion source , @xmath21 .",
    "we choose the sink of the three - point function as @xmath22 , so that the correlation function is symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to this time , @xmath23 we can then separate the correlation function into contributions from @xmath24 to the left and to the right of @xmath25 ( referred to as l.h.s .  and r.h.s .  in the following ) and",
    "neglect either the second or first term in eq .",

    "this technique also has the advantage that fluctuations of the correlation functions tend to cancel in the ratio and we thus obtain a better signal . with our choice @xmath33 ,",
    "such a ratio is @xmath34^{\\!\\frac{1}{2}}\\,.\\ ] ] similar ratios have already been used in earlier works on pion and nucleon structure .",
    "here we take the somewhat more complicated ratio , which was used for the nucleon in @xcite , because we use momentum combinations with @xmath35 .",
    "contributions to this ratio from excited states with energy @xmath36 are suppressed as long as @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the pion energy .",
    "a potential problem is that , due to the exponential decay of the pion two - point function , the signal at @xmath40 for non - vanishing momenta is poor . for finite statistics",
    "the two - point function can then take negative values , which prevents one from evaluating the square root .",
    "we try to overcome this difficulty by shifting the two - point functions @xmath41 that enter with @xmath40 .",
    "using the identity @xmath42 valid for @xmath22 , we shift by @xmath43 , which significantly reduces the number of negative two - point functions .",
    "nevertheless there are still momentum transfers @xmath44 for which the argument of the square root in the ratio is negative .",
    "those values are discarded when we evaluate the form factor .",
    "for @xmath45 the ratio does not exhibit a proper plateau that could immediately be used for fitting .",
    "this is due to our choice for @xmath25 , for which the time dependence of the pion two - point function can not be approximated by a single exponential in the @xmath24 regions we use to extract the form factor , see eq .  .",
    "in fact , we now show that the ratio is approximately antisymmetric around the central point @xmath46 of the l.h.s .",

    "however , such an averaged signal also includes unwanted symmetric contributions . fortunately , for our pion masses and",
    "lattice momenta already the leading symmetric term is negligible , because with the lattice spacing @xmath55 we have @xmath56 and @xmath57 in our fits .",
    "we hence obtain a good signal for the averaged ratio .",

    ".   ratio and its central point @xmath47 . a typical ratio at non - zero momentum transfer is shown in fig .  [ fig : pp1 ] for one of our data sets , along with the familiar plateau for zero momentum transfer .",
    "note that the ratio does not exhibit a plateau for arbitrary momenta . to visualise the absence of possible contributions from excited states one has to consider the ratio for @xmath58 . in this case",
    "the time dependence of the three - point function should vanish .",
    "we have checked that this is indeed the case in the region we average over , within the expected increase of noise for higher momenta or lower pion masses .",

    "the dashed lines indicate the regions we average over . ]    from eqs .",
    "and we see that the lattice ratio can be used to extract the form factor @xmath65 .",
    "using then several combinations of momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 that all give the same @xmath44 provides an over - constrained set of equations , from which we determine @xmath66 by @xmath67 minimisation .",
    "we increase the quality of our signal by averaging the ratio over the contributions on the l.h.s .  and r.h.s .",
    "this requires the additional sign factor @xmath62 between the two sides , as can be seen in eq .  .",
    "the energies @xmath68 and @xmath69 appearing in and are calculated using the lattice pion masses and the continuum dispersion relation .",
    "we also performed a test of the dispersion relation for some of our lattices .",
    "it was increasingly difficult to extract a signal for higher momenta , especially for the lowest pion masses .",
    "however , we found that the continuum dispersion relation can be used to describe the data and that a lattice dispersion relation is not favoured .",
    "we perform our simulations with two flavours of non - perturbatively clover - improved dynamical wilson fermions and wilson glue . using these actions ,",
