    "the discovery of an excess of iridium at the cretaceous - tertiary boundary of 65 myr bp , and its interpretation as the result of an asteroid impact ( smit & hertogen 1980 , alvarez et al 1980 ) , lent support to the hypothesis that large - body impacts are the prime cause of mass extinctions on earth ( napier & clube 1979 , raup 1991 , rampino 1994 ) .",
    "however subsequent studies have not , with the still - debated exception of the cretaceous - tertiary event itself , confirmed this hypothesis . for example",
    "the chesapeake ( 40  km ) and popigai ( 90  km ) craters are amongst the largest known terrestrial impact structures , dated to @xmath035.5  myr , in the late eocene , but are associated with only minor , regional extinctions of a few radiolarian species .",
    "the 80  km manicougan crater , aged 214  myr , is likewise associated with only minor extinctions .",
    "matsumoto & kubotani ( 1996 ) found that the mass extinction and impact crater records are correlated with only 93 - 97% significance .",
    "considerable attention has been paid to the question of periodicity in the impact cratering record , and whether , if such exists , it can be connected with galactic cycles or mass extinction episodes ; the issue remains controversial ( cf bailer - jones 2009 , 2011 , melott & bambach 2013 ) .",
    "less attention has been paid to the issue of _ episodes _ of bombardment , although several such have been noted and claims have been made of correlation with mass extinction ( keller et al 2012 ; mcghee 1996 ) .",
    "comet showers induced by stellar penetration of the inner oort cloud , or asteroid showers deriving from the breakup of main belt asteroids , are inadequate by about an order of magnitude to reproduce the sharpness , amplitude and frequency of the bombardment episodes ( napier & asher 2009 ) .",
    "leakage from the main asteroid belt appears in any case to be inadequate by an order of magnitude to supply near - earth object impactors say more than 3 or 4 km across ( menichella et al 1996 , minton & malhotra 2010 ) . it has been proposed that bombardment episodes are caused by the disintegration of giant comets in short - period , earth - crossing orbits ( clube & napier 1984 ) .",
    "a more recent worldwide extinction of species at 12,800 bp , accompanied by a climate cooling which lasted for over 1000 years , has likewise been attributed to an encounter with the debris from such a body ( napier 2010 ; wittke et al 2013 ; moore et al 2014 ) , although this remains a controversial proposition ( van hoesel et al 2014 ) .",
    "models that neglect the injection of large comets into the near - earth environment ( e.g chapman 2004 , boslough et al 2013 ) fail to yield large - scale catastrophic disruption of this sort in the recent past , but it remains to be seen how often such comets arrive and what effect they may have on the biosphere over geological as well as human timescales ; this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "recent years have seen the discovery of large populations of apparently icy bodies , some in unstable orbits , at the edge of the planetary system .",
    "hahn & bailey ( 1990 ) have demonstrated that 95p / chiron , the first centaur to be discovered , is in a chaotic orbit and may have entered a short - period , earth - crossing configuration several times over the past @xmath010@xmath1  yr . from spitzer observations its diameter is estimated to be 233@xmath214   km ( stansberry et al 2008 ) . the potential for icy bodies of 100 km diameter upwards to enter short period orbits with perihelia @xmath31au has been demonstrated both theoretically ( hahn & bailey loc .",
    "cit . ) and observationally .",
    "sekanina and colleagues ( 2000 , 2003 , 2004 , 2007 ) have shown that the kreutz group of sungrazing comets is derived from a complex hierarchy of fragmentations , starting with the disintegration of a progenitor comet of probable diameter @xmath0100  km about 1700 years ago .",
    "likewise an extensive study of the taurid complex supports the view that it originated from the breakup of an exceptionally large comet in the distant past ( whipple 1940 , sekanina 1972 , clube & napier 1984 , asher et al 1994 ) .",
    "the currently observed system may be at least 20,000 years old ( steel et al 1991 ) , but an injection in a much more distant past is also possible",
    ".    a 100  km comet striking the earth would carry @xmath01000 times the energy involved in the creation of the 150  km chicxulub crater and would presumably remove the surface biosphere ; impact crater statistics show this to have been an unlikely event over the 600  myr timescale of the phanerozoic .",
    "however , disintegration seems to be a normal if not predominant mode of comet loss . given that a chiron - sized body has a mass 10@xmath4 - 10@xmath5  gm , as against @xmath6  gm for the entire current near - earth asteroid system",
    ", there is the potential for a substantially enhanced hazard during the breakup of such a body in the inner planetary system .",
    "such a breakup might involve multiple bombardment episodes and substantial dust input ( clube & napier 1984 ) , leading perhaps to a qualitatively different astronomical scenario for mass extinctions from that of a single , 10  km asteroid impact ( alvarez et al 1980 ) .",
    "di sisto & brunini ( 2007 ) modelled the centaur population on the assumption that it derives from the scattered disc one , following the evolution of 1000 objects for 4.5 gyr and estimating the population by scaling from an assumed scattered disc population of 7.5@xmath7 bodies with radii @xmath81  km ( fernndez et al 2004 ) .",
    "they deduced a population of 2.8@xmath9 centaurs , with an order of magnitude uncertainty .",
    "the mean dynamical lifetime @xmath10 of centaurs was found to decline strongly with perihelion distance , with @xmath1110  myr for objects with @xmath317au , down to 7.6  myr for bodies with 5.2@xmath1230au and @xmath06.2myr for centaurs defined as @xmath1340au and @xmath1429au .",
    "horner et al ( 2004a , 2004b ) obtained @xmath152.7  myr for a sample of centaurs defined by the latter criteria .",
    "the hazard represented by the arrival of large comets is determined in part by their rate of arrival in the near - earth environment rather than their mean lifetime as centaurs , and this rate is dominated by that of the most dynamically unstable bodies at any given time .",
    "horner et al ( 2004b ) , simulating the evolution of chiron with 729 clones for up to 3  myr , found that over this time , more than half the clones became short - period comets at some point , and 85 became earth - crossers .",
    "similar behaviour occurred in other centaur clones with similar orbits .",
    "the 65 earth - crossing epochs were due to 9 clones entering and re - entering these orbits . ]",
    "i carried out orbital integrations of chiron clones over 1  myr with the mercury software developed by chambers ( 1999 ) , using the same input conditions as horner et al ( 2004b ) .",
    "all the planets were incorporated .",
    "the hybrid part of the package was used ( employing a symplectic integrator , but switching to bulirsch - stoer for close encounters ) .",
    "the accuracy parameter was set to 10@xmath16 and initial timestep was 60 days ; over a typical run this conserved energy to a fraction @xmath17 and angular momentum to @xmath18 .",
    "of 100 clones , 86 were ejected within 1  myr , their mean dynamical lifetimes before ejection being 0.35 myr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ejection ] ) .",
    "about half temporarily entered short - period orbits , and nine temporarily entered earth - crossing orbits , often repeatedly .",
    "there were 65 earth - crossing epochs in all , ranging from @xmath0100 to @xmath014000  yr , with mean duration @xmath02000 yr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : earthlife ] ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of one such clone , which included a short - period phase ( @xmath193.5 - 5.3  yr ) of 50,000 year duration , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiron ] . in these runs the bodies are treated as point masses and their physical evolution is neglected .",
    "if 100 simulated chirons , with mean lifetime 0.35  myr , yield 65 earth - crossing episodes , then the frequency of such episodes is 65/100/0.35 chiron@xmath20 , giving recurrence time @xmath01.9 myr per chiron clone .",
    "di sisto & brunini ( 2007 ) estimated the number of centaurs larger than chiron to be 360@xmath21650 , of which there are 4@xmath217 within 18au of the sun ( centaurs are here defined as objects with perihelia between jupiter and neptune , irrespective of semi - major axis ) .",
    "this is consistent with the discovery of four centaurs larger than chiron , three of them within 18au of the sun .",
    "if there are typically four objects of this size at any given time with similar orbital properties , each with arrival probability into an earth - crossing orbit of @xmath220.5  myr@xmath23 , then there is an expectation of one chiron - sized earth - crosser every half a million years or so .",
    "the size distribution of centaurs may depend on the relative contributions from their source populations . for long - period comets ,",
    "fernndez & sosa ( 2012 ) find a cumulative radius @xmath24 distribution @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , consistent with @xmath27 for an evolved population in the diameter range 20 - 200 km , expected from current models of planetesimal growth ( e.g. kenyon & bromley 2012 ) .",
    "bauer et al ( 2013 ) analysed thermal infrared observations of 52 centaurs obtained from the wide - field infrared survey explorer and obtained a biased power law size distribution with index @xmath28 .",
    "if we adopt a diameter @xmath29=240 km ( stansberry et al 2007 ) , then with these distributions the number of comets in chiron - like orbits , @xmath30100 km diameter , entering earth - crossing orbits in a million years is @xmath06 - 14 times the chiron rate of entry , or about one every 36,000 - 86,000 years .",
    "this figure is likely to be conservative as additional contributions are expected from more remote centaurs .",
    "asher & steel ( 1993 ) , for example , followed the evolution of the large centaur 5145 pholus over 1  myr using 27 clones , which yielded two particles entering earth - crossing orbits for several tens of thousands of years , implying that a body in such an orbit has a 5 - 10% chance becoming earth crossing within a million years .    defining the system of jupiter family comets ( jfcs ) as having orbital periods",
    "@xmath3120  yr and tisserand criterion @xmath323 , di sisto et al ( 2009 ) estimate a population of @xmath33=450 with perihelia @xmath32.5  au . for a mass distribution @xmath34 in the radius range 1@xmath3510  km ,",
    "the mass of the jfc system is then @xmath36 where ( @xmath37 ) are respectively the masses corresponding to jfcs of radius ( 10  km , 1  km ) respectively .",
    "the size distribution adopted by di sisto et al translates to a population index @xmath38 . with this , and @xmath39 , we find @xmath408100@xmath41 .",
    "a comet of radius 1  km and density @xmath42  gm@xmath43 has mass @xmath442.6@xmath45  gm . hence @xmath402.2@xmath46  gm . a similar exercise for the current near - earth asteroids ( nea ) yields , if they are largely composed of rock with density 2.5  gm@xmath43 , a mass @xmath05@xmath46  gm . a 250  km comet with density 0.5  gm@xmath43 has mass @xmath05@xmath47  gm , two thousand times that of the current jfcs and a thousand times that of the neas",
    ". thus in terms of earth - crossing mass the present - day impact hazard represents , not a steady state , but a snapshot of a strongly flickering system .",
    "the fluctuation timescale is @xmath00.5 myr for bodies of at least chiron size , and @xmath00.03 - 0.1  myr for comets at least 100  km in diameter .",
    "at higher resolution still , showing a transition from water snowline ( sublimation at @xmath482.5au ) to a short - period orbit with @xmath31au in less than 1000 years . ]",
    "the outgassing of an active chiron - sized comet in say a 5  yr orbital period ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chiron ] ) is equivalent to that of 15,000 halley - sized comets in encke - like orbits , or in excess of 40 strong meteor showers per night , and the same by day .",
    "apart from periods of dormancy , this will persist over the dynamical or physical residence time of the comet , whichever is shorter .",
    "such intense atmospheric bombardment is expected to have consequences for the biosphere ( section  [ sec : terr ] ) .",
    "this decay mode may be checked , albeit temporarily , by the development of a refractory porous crust . in the rubble mantle model of jewitt ( 2002 ) ,",
    "the timescale for mantle growth for a water ice and carbon monoxide composition is of order a year at 2.5au and @xmath0100  yr at 5au .",
    "the transfer of a centaur from an orbit with @xmath49au ( the water snowline ) to an earth - crossing orbit may take place in less than 1000 years ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snowline ] ) .    `",
    "spontaneous ' splitting or fragmentation of very large comets are probably unimportant disintegration routes since their escape velocities ( @xmath070 ms@xmath23 for a 250 km comet , @xmath030 ms@xmath23 for a 100 km one ) are in excess of the likely separation speeds of fragments .",
    "disintegration is more likely to take place through sublimation , or tidal disruption by the sun or jupiter .",
    "the simplest breakup mode , namely generation of an intense meteoroid stream along the track of the comet , has been discussed by clube & napier ( 1984 ) . according to pik ( 1951 ) ,",
    "a comet loses @xmath50  m of surface per revolution , a figure not very different from that found empirically by di sisto et al ( 2009 ) .",
    "this yields an output of 10@xmath51  gm of gas and dust per revolution for a chiron - sized body in an encke - like orbit , but could rapidly produce a dormant stage , so preserving the integrity of the comet as its perihelion is driven downwards ( e.g. rickman et al 1990 ) .    tidal disruption by jupiter is also a common process , several examples having occurred in recent times ( e.g. d/1993 f2 shoemaker - levy 9 ) .",
    "the timescale for collision of a 1  km jfc on jupiter is about a decade ( zahnle et al .",
    "1998 , sanchez - lavega 2010 ) , implying that passage of a comet within its roche limit ( @xmath52 ) is virtually an annual event .",
    "it is thus likely that the jfc system is replenished sporadically by the disintegration of large comets passing within the jovian roche lobe ( bredichin 1889 ) .",
    "pittich & rickman ( 1994 ) have shown that fragments of a jfc so disrupted would lose their memory of a common origin within a few thousand years .",
    "a @xmath010@xmath53 enhancement of the jfc population by the disruption of a 250  km comet would feed into a corresponding increase in the neo cometary population over the physico - dynamical decay time of the jfc .    a common fate of comets thrown into short - period orbits , if not disintegration through sublimation , is tidal disruption by the sun ( e.g. the @xmath0100  km kreutz progenitor ) .",
    "destruction through tides is a volume rather than a surface phenomenon , and is only weakly dependent on the size of the comet .",
    "bailey et al ( 1992 ) have shown that , under the influence of slowly acting secular perturbations of the giant planets , @xmath05 - 15% of comets with initial perihelion distances @xmath32  au may evolve into a sungrazing or sun - colliding state .",
    "this evolution occurs at intervals of order 10@xmath53 revolutions , about a tenth of the dynamical ejection timescale .",
    "the tidal disruption of a comet entering the roche limit , @xmath54 , may create a hierarchy of fragmentations .",
    "passage through such clusters , before they disperse into the background , will generate one or more series of sharp bombardments , analogous to meteor storms but of much greater intensity , throughout the lifetime of the comet .",
    "ipatov & mather ( 2004 ) , following the orbital evolution of 26,000 fictitious jupiter - crossing objects , found that bodies in orbits close to that of comet 2p / encke had mean collision probabilities with the terrestrial planets about two orders of magnitude greater than those of other comets , remaining in typical neo orbits for millions of years .",
    "levison et al ( 2006 ) , following orbits from the kuiper belt , deduced that at any one time there should be one to a dozen objects in encke - like orbits , neglecting both physical decay and nongravitational effects .",
    "they found that the time taken for a jfc to attain an encke - like orbit , dynamically uncoupled from jupiter , is 0.1  myr , two orders of magnitude longer than its physical lifetime , but proposed that 2p / encke might have survived destruction through a period of dormancy .    unless dormancy is 100% , however , non - gravitational forces may operate and enhance the rate of transfer substantially in combination with mean motion resonances with jupiter ( steel & asher 1996 ; fernandez et al 2004 ; pittich et al 2004 ) .",
    "the acceleration due to such forces varies as area / mass , i.e. @xmath55 , but the fuel available @xmath56 and unless permanent dormancy intervenes , long term non - gravitational perturbations ( acceleration times time ) are thus more effective in perturbing large comets ( @xmath57 ) . in the event of a perihelion disintegration , for example",
    ", the cross - sectional area of fragments reaching the earth s distance is typically about 10,000 times that of the comet itself , for an initial dispersion speed of 5 ms@xmath23 ( napier 2010 ) .",
    "however the transition probability from the jf to encke domains remains uncertain to order of magnitude .    in summary , on the arrival of a giant comet in an earth - crossing orbit , whether jupiter family or encke - like , several modes of disintegration are possible which may act to enhance the terrestrial bombardment rate by two or three powers of ten over background , during its physico - dynamical lifetime .",
    "direct impact of an incoming large comet is much less probable than interaction with its debris , which may include many short - lived fragments , and a correspondingly spiky distribution of terrestrial impactors is expected .",
    "this can be tested by examining the impact cratering record .",

    "this latter arises from a combination of physical and dynamical evolution ( di sisto et al 2009 ) . for models in which impactors are the disintegration products of cascading fragmentation , @xmath81 is probably somewhat smaller ( sekanina & chodas 2007 ; ishiguro et al .",
    "+ ( c ) the measured duration of a bombardment episode was taken to be 2  myr , determined largely by the dating uncertainties ( table  [ ta : craterlist ] ) .",
    "+ ( d ) typically , in each trial , 200 craters were generated in this way over a 500  myr period .",
    "they were then reduced in numbers randomly , in proportions matching the observed decline of detected craters derived from the rice cubic fit , until 41 remained .",

    "it is clear from the figure that the observed count of 27 pairs with @xmath83  myr is rare under the hypothesis @xmath84 of no clustering , but is comfortably encompassed by a wide range of bombardment amplitudes .",
    "the probability of no impact clustering , given the dataset @xmath29 , can be expressed as @xmath85 where @xmath86 @xmath87 represents the clustering hypothesis , @xmath88 and @xmath89 represent prior probabilities in bayesian terminology and the summation is taken over all viable cluster models @xmath90 corresponding to @xmath91 = 2 , 3 , 4  .",

    "thus the posterior odds ratio @xmath97 , a positive result favouring the existence of clustered impacts .      although the existence of impact episodes is thereby indicated , their intensity is not well constrained .",
    "the widths of the bombardment episodes in the trials , typically 2  myr , may reflect dating uncertainties rather than their true duration .",
    "an amplitude of factor three above background over 2  myr translates to a factor of 300 over background for a comet disintegration of 20,000 years duration , or 3000 over 2000 years .",
    "the only impact episode for which we have precise relative dating is that of 65  myr bp .",
    "the chicxulub structure of that era is the largest impact crater known to have been formed over the phanerozoic , and is generally associated with the end - cretaceous extinctions with estimated species loss of @xmath05783% . although originally ascribed to an asteroid impact , iridium and energy constraints yield a best estimate that the impactor was a comet 10 - 80 km in diameter ( durand - manterola & codero - tercero 2014 ) .",
    "however a detailed stratigraphic study of the ukrainian boltysh crater by jolley et al ( 2010 ) has shown that it was formed only 2000 - 2500 years before the chicxulub impact in the gulf of mexico ( the radiometric age given in table[ta : craterlist ] has standard deviation @xmath20.6  myr ) .",
    "this short timescale is consistent with the breakup of a large short - period comet yielding @xmath33 earth - crossing fragments with dynamical or physical lifetimes @xmath98  yr such that @xmath99 , where @xmath100 represents the mean lifetime of a fragment before collision with the earth . for a comet in an encke - like orbit , @xmath101  myr and 10@xmath1 km - sized fragments lasting 2000  yr ( with total mass corresponding to a nominal 70 km diameter comet ) or 10@xmath102 fragments lasting 20,000  yr ( a 30 km comet ) would suffice .",
    "other contenders for bombardment episodes are comet showers from the oort cloud , or impacts from the disintegration of asteroids in the main belt , but neither mechanism seems capable of reproducing the sharpness and amplitude of the observed episodes .",
    "kaib & quinn ( 2009 ) constrain the strength of comet showers through stellar penetrations of the inner oort cloud , by noting that too high a comet number density in the inner oort cloud would overproduce long period comets .",
    "they find that there has been no more than about one shower of eocene - oligocene strength over the past 500  myr .",
    "terrestrial impacts from the breakup of main belt asteroids are too infrequent by order of magnitude to account for the episodes ( napier 2006 ) .",

    "this came from the paleobiology database and the compendium by jack sepkoski : discussion and references are found in melott & bambach ( 2010 ) .",
    "the impact crater ages employed have been determined radiometrically , whereas the marine extinctions are generally based on stratigraphy and contain rounding errors due to the assignment of extinctions to the nearest geological substage .",

    "18 events in the last 500  myr may properly be described as mass extinctions . in table",
    "[ ta : compare ] these extinction peaks are listed along with those bombardments which occur within @xmath25  myr of a peak .",
    "the well - dated single impacts in fig .",
    "[ fig : kernel ] are included .",
    "two of the mass extinctions , events 14 and 15 , are extremely close together and share a bombardment episode . for statistical purposes",
    "they are here counted as one . if we regard each bombardment episode as a single event and include the single impacts , there are 14 impact episodes , seven of which lie within @xmath23  myr of an extinction episode , six within @xmath22  myr and four within @xmath21  myr .",
    "seven coincide with the terminations of major geological boundaries to within the dating errors , namely the ordovician , devonian , permian , triassic , jurassic , cretaceous and eocene .",
    "the bombardments comprise 11 multiple episodes ( table  [ ta : craterlist ] ) and three singles .",
    "monte carlo trials were carried out in which 14 synthetic bombardment episodes were randomly extracted over 500 million years , and the number which lay within @xmath103  myr of the bambach mass extinction ( table  [ ta : compare ] ) was recorded .",
    "not more than one episode could be assigned to an extinction , since they would not be distinguishable . in reality",
    ", uncertainty attaches also to the precise dating of the extinctions , and this may be soaked up in @xmath103 .",
    "trials for each of the thresholds @xmath104(3,2,1 )  myr yielded probabilities ( 0.032 , 0.005 , 0.012 ) that the coincidences are due to chance . excluding the first 30  myr of the extinction and bombardment records ( in case the recent ` episode ' is actually discovery bias ) , makes no essential difference to the probabilities .",
    "these coincidences independently validate the reality of the cratering episodes since , if they were statistical artefacts , there would be no reason to expect them to correlate with the observed mass extinctions .",
    "they also demonstrate that bombardment episodes have been major factors in the evolution of life since the pre - cambrian explosion .",
    "there is continuing debate amongst palaeontologists about whether the cretaceous - palaeogene extinctions were sudden and caused by the chicxulub impact , or whether there was a more continuous decline over @xmath781  myr of species caused by global cooling , sealevel fluctuations and the main phase of the deccan vulcanisms ( macleod 2013 ) .",
    "no other mass extinction has yet been identified with a single large crater , and most or all of the impact peaks are due to impactors too small to have caused major mass extinctions on their own .",
    "for example , the araguainha crater in central brazil is only 40 km across and was itself incapable of causing the near - extinction of life at the permo - triassic boundary 250 million years ago ; the end - ordovician peak at 445  myr represents two craters only a few kilometres in diameter ; the triassic peak at 200  myr represents two impact structures with diameters in the probable range 20 - 40 km , and so on .",
    "the collectively strong association of such minor impactors with major extinctions implies that they are proxies rather than individual causes of the mass extinctions .",
    "the stepwise nature of several mass extinctions has often been noted , and the hypothesis of multiple impacts as their cause , based on purely biostratigraphic considerations , is not new ( e.g. the late devonian crisis of 365 - 368 myr bp : mcghee 1996 ) . some of these ancient events were highly destructive , with intensities that came close to extinguishing life on earth .",
    "there is , however , a spectrum of intensities , as there is a spectrum of comet masses , and the correlation evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] and table  [ ta : compare ] suggests that episodes of bombardment may exert a more continuous control over the evolution of species than would be expected simply from rare , isolated impacts .",
    "a progressive ` toughening ' of marine genera with time is evident from the slope of the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] .",
    "there is no obvious astrophysical explanation for this decline in extinction rate , but no need for one as several palaeontological hypotheses have been advanced to account for it ( macleod 2013 ) .",
    "birks et al ( 2007 ) have pointed out that the most damage which can be done to the biosphere with the least impact energy is to deplete the stratospheric ozone layer , so increasing the level of uvb radiation reaching the surface of the earth .",
    "depletion by way of impact occurs partly through the activation of halogens thrown into the stratosphere through salt - water impact , and partly through the injection of no created in the impact fireball .",
    "they consider that the impact of a @xmath00.5  km asteroid would have serious implications for the biosphere , and that such impacts occur at @xmath00.1  myr intervals .",
    "the effects of enhanced uvb on terrestrial organisms have been discussed by numerous authors .",
    "melott & thomas ( 2011 ) have pointed out that a current anthropogenic 3% depletion in global stratospheric ozone is causing measurable damage to the biosphere ( hder et al 2007 ) .",
    "they consider that a 30% depletion is well above the lethality level for phytoplankton , which lie at the base of the oceanic food chain .",
    "such a depletion would cause a major marine extinction event .",
    "melott et al ( 2010 ) have also pointed out that cometary airbursts may create nitrous oxides in the stratosphere , depleting ozone . in the present scenario",
    ", bombardment episodes may enhance the frequency of small impacts by two or three powers of 10 over background during the disintegration of a giant short - period comet .",
    "a further possible effect is climatic perturbation due to the dust production expected in the course of disintegration .",
    "if cometary fireballs are reduced to micron - sized particles on entering the atmosphere ( klekociuk et al 2005 ) , then a current infall of cosmic dust of 40,000@xmath220,000 tons a year ( love & brownlee 1993 ) yields an atmospheric optical depth @xmath1058@xmath106 for an absorption coefficient @xmath107@xmath108g@xmath23 .",
    "this figure may rise to @xmath1050.2 over the course of a giant comet disintegration ( napier 2001 ) , raising the prospect of repeated pulses of global cooling each of millennia in duration .",
    "as with the periodicity issue , the analysis of bombardment episodes is inhibited by small number statistics .",
    "nevertheless positive evidence for such episodes appears in the impact cratering record .",
    "they are found to be tightly correlated with substantial marine extinctions at the level of genera . to date only the cretaceous - tertiary extinctions",
    "have been widely identified as being caused by a single large impact , and even that claim is disputed by many palaeontologists ( keller et al 2012 , macleod 2013 , keller & kerr 2014 ) .",
    "several large impact craters , which might have been expected to have caused mass extinctions , are associated with only minor , regional ones .",
    "the main asteroid belt seems inadequate to supply the larger impactors , and large cometary populations have now been revealed extending to beyond the planetary system , with the potential to be thrown into the near - earth environment .",
    "the top - heavy mass distribution of these comets , their likely disintegration history when thrown into short - period orbits , and the potential of their debris to cause deleterious effects , make them likely candidates for the mass extinctions observed in the terrestrial record and the associated geological disturbances .",
    "the mechanisms involved are a matter for detailed stratigraphic studies ; it is suggested here that prolonged atmospheric perturbations arising from fireball storms and dusting are the most energy - efficient means of collapsing food chains , yielding both marine and land extinctions .",
