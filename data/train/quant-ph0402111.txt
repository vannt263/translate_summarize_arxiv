    "the hyperfine states have decoherence times that are potentially many seconds long , limited mainly by weak interactions with the trapping fields and background gas collisions due to imperfect vacuum conditions .",
    "despite their superb isolation from the environment the qubits can be rapidly initialized and manipulated with near resonant optical fields through optical pumping and stimulated raman processes .",
    "a number of protocols for two - qubit gates have been proposed including ground state collisions@xcite , optically induced short range dipole - dipole interactions@xcite , and dipole - dipole interactions between highly excited rydberg states@xcite . among the different approaches to implementing neutral atom logic gates",
    "the rydberg gate is unique in that the gate operation is essentially independent of the motional state of the atoms . because of this the rydberg gate",
    "is not limited to speeds that are slow compared to trap vibrational frequencies and can potentially be run at mhz rates or faster@xcite .",
    "the combination of long decoherence times and fast gate operation is advantageous for building a scalable quantum processor .",
    "however , the requirements of fast state readout and state transmission in a quantum network environment are not easily satisfied . in this work",
    "we examine coherent coupling of a single atom to a many atom mesoscopic qubit for enhanced measurement and transmission capabilities .",
    "the approach described here may be generic in the sense that introduction of a mesoscopic intermediary helps to  impedance match \" the flow of information from the microdomain of a single atom to the macroscopic propagation distance available to a single photon .",
    "the approach we describe complements recent research that has resulted in the capability of storing and generating photonic states using mesoscopic atomic ensembles@xcite and may lead to the creation of distant entanglement between ensembles@xcite",
    ".    it may be preferable to store information in single atom qubits , as opposed to ensembles , since they have substantially longer coherence times due to the absence of collisions .",
    "state measurement on atomic qubits can be performed by measuring optically induced single atom fluorescence@xcite .",
    "alternatively amplitude@xcite and/or phase shifts imparted to a tightly focused probe beam can be used . in either case poissonian photon counting statistics result in measurement times that are several orders of magnitude longer than rydberg gate operation times . while the use of subpoissonian light could be advantageous in this context",

    "quantum state transmission between single atoms over a photonic channel requires strong atom to photon coupling and high fidelity protocols for state transmission and distant entanglement@xcite are based on interfacing atoms with ultra high finesse optical cavities . while impressive experimental advances have been made in achieving strong coupling of a single atom to a cavity mode@xcite the problem of coupling a large number of atomic qubits in a quantum processor to high finesse cavities remains an extremely demanding challenge .        in this work",

    "the protocol for a collective two - qubit phase gate between @xmath19 is identical . in terms of the actual implementation",
    "the main differences are that the pulse areas are @xmath20 smaller for a collective qubit and the rydberg level must be chosen with care to avoid zeroes in the dipole - dipole interaction@xcite .",
    "taking these differences into account it is apparent that we can also achieve a mixed gate between single atom and collective qubits from the sequence : @xmath13 pulse on @xmath3 , @xmath15 pulse on @xmath4 , @xmath13 pulse on @xmath3 .",

    "the additional level @xmath35 is used for two - photon single qubit operations needed to complete the cnot operation , and for enhancement of the three - photon @xmath36 mapping .",
    "provided there is a non - zero clebsch - gordan coefficient the mapping @xmath37 could also be achieved with a single photon transition , as in recent experiments on photon storage and generation with atomic ensembles@xcite . in such a case the phase matching condition is simply @xmath38 so the photon emission is collinear with the preparation pulse . with judicious choice of experimental parameters one polarization component of the emitted photon can still be separated from an orthogonally polarized excitation pulse . while this implies a 50 % loss in efficiency it would simplify the experimental implementation .",
    "we concentrate here on a four photon scheme which has the advantage of allowing the generated photon to be very efficiently separated from the excitation pulse due to its different direction of propagation .",
    "the probability of emission into the mode along @xmath39 can be calculated as follows .",
    "the @xmath1 atoms are assumed confined in an ellipsoidally shaped harmonic trap that is created by focusing a single far off resonance laser beam with wavelength @xmath40 to a gaussian waist of radius @xmath41 in a parabolic approximation , valid when the atomic temperature @xmath42 is much less than @xmath43 ( the trap depth expressed in temperature units ) the density distribution can be written as @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the transverse coordinate , @xmath46 is along the symmetry axis of the trap , @xmath47 is the width of the atomic cloud , @xmath48 , and the aspect ratio is @xmath49 the total number of atoms in the ellipsoidal volume is then @xmath50 and the radiated mode will be of gaussian form with a waist radius @xmath51    this gaussian mode radiates coherently into a solid angle @xmath52 the probability of phase - matched photon emission into this mode is @xmath53 and the probability of emission into a random direction outside of this mode is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a normalization constant proportional to the emission probability per unit solid angle .",

    "first consider conventional readout of a single atom qubit based on strong driving of the closed transition between state @xmath31 and the auxiliary state @xmath24@xcite .",
    "the scattered photons are collected by a lens with solid angle @xmath61 and counted by a detector with quantum efficiency @xmath62 the number of counts obtained after time @xmath63 is @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the radiative lifetime of the excited state . a measurement strategy that uses a threshold condition in the presence of a fixed background rate results in a detection fidelity that improves exponentially with @xmath66 here , and in the rest of the paper , we base numerical estimates on atomic parameters corresponding to @xmath67rb ( @xmath68 ) and optical detection parameters corresponding to a possible experimental implementation@xcite ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and background rate of @xmath71 ) .",
