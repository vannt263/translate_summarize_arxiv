    "when one extends the validity of the low energy effective field theory to energy scales much higher than its characteristic mass scale , one faces to a scale hierarchy problem .",
    "a typical example is the gauge hierarchy problem of the standard model of the strong and electroweak interactions , seen as a low - energy effective theory .",
    "when the standard model is extrapolated to cut - off scales @xmath1tev , there is no symmetry protecting the mass of the elementary higgs field from acquiring large value , and therefore the masses of the weak gauge bosons , receive large quantum corrections proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the most popular solution to the gauge hierarchy problem of the standard model is to extend it to a model with global n=1 supersymmetry , effectively broken at a scale @xmath3tev .",
    "( see ref.@xcite for a general review . )",
    "these extensions of the standard model , for instance the minimal supersymmetric standard model(mssm ) , can be safely extrapolated up to cut - off scales much higher than the electroweak scale , such as the supersymmetric unification scale @xmath4gev , the string scale @xmath5gev , or planck scale @xmath6gev .    to go beyond the mssm",
    ", one must move to a more fundamental theory with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the possible candidate for such a theory is n=1 supergravity coupled to gauge and matter fields , where the spontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry is not incompatible with vanishing vacuum energy@xcite .",
    "( of course , supersymmetry breaking can be transmitted by gauge interaction@xcite .",
    "but here we concentrate on the supergravity mediated supersymmetry breaking models . ) in n=1 supergravity , the spin 2 graviton has as superpartner , the spin 3/2 gravitino . here",
    "we consider the case that the supersymmetry breaking is spontaneous , via the super - higgs mechanism@xcite .",
    "one is then bound to interpret the mssm as an effective low - energy theory derived from spontaneously broken supergravity .",
    "the scale of soft supersymmetry breaking in mssm , @xmath7 , is related to the gravitino mass @xmath8 , which sets the scale of the spontaneous breaking of local supersymmetry .",
    "the idea of breaking supersymmetry in a dynamical way was first presented in ref.@xcite . in those articles a general topological argument was developed in terms of the witten index @xmath9 , showing that dynamical supersymmetry breaking can not be achieved unless there is chiral matter or we include supergravity effects for which the index argument can not apply .",
    "this is subsequently verified by explicitly studying gaugino condensation in pure supersymmetric yang - mills , a vector - like theory , for which gauginos condensate but do not break global supersymmetry . breaking global supersymmetry with chiral matter was an open possibility in principle , but this approach ran into many problems when tried to be realized in practice@xcite .",
    "the situation was improved very much with the coupling to supergravity .",
    "the reason was that the simple gaugino condensation was found to be sufficient to break supersymmetry once the coupling to gravity was included@xcite .",
    "this works in the hidden sector mechanism where gravity is the messenger of supersymmetry breaking to the observable sector .",
    "however , this mechanism does not work when the gauge couplings are considered to be field dependent . non - perturbative effects , like gaugino condensations , raises the moduli flat potentials , but it is very difficult to obtain a phenomenological vacuum state .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the runaway behavior of dilaton potential@xcite .",
    "gaugino condensation with field dependent gauge couplings was anticipated and realized in a very natural way in string theory .",
    "the gauge couplings are functions of dilaton and moduli fields .",
    "furthermore , string theory provides a natural realization of the hidden sector models by having a hidden sector@xcite .",
    "thus it is important to consider the following questions : does gaugino really condensate in supergravity theories ?",
    "if so , is runaway potential stabilized ?",
    "if runaway potential is not stabilized by gaugino condensation , what effect should be responsible for the moduli fixing ?",
    "we know that an ordinary effective lagrangian analysis can not give us a satisfactory answer and we think it is very important to develop new ideas to analyze the dynamical properties of supergravity theories .",
    "( assuming the scenario of two or more gaugino condensates , the effective lagrangian with confined hidden sector stabilizes the dilaton potential and breaks supersymmetry with a more complicated dilaton superpotential generated by multiple gaugino condensations@xcite .",
    "however , one solution for the stabilization of the dilaton in the effective lagrangian requires a delicate cancellation between the contributions from different gaugino condensates , which is not very natural .",
    "the other solution generally requires the assistance of an additional source of supersymmetry breaking@xcite . ) in this paper , we have developed a new method for the analysis of the dynamical properties of supersymmetry theories .",
    "of course , as is recently discussed by many authors@xcite , we may find a solution to this problem by introducing a new type of non - perturbative effects .",
    "one of the very promising candidates is the effects of strongly coupled strings , but we do not consider this possibility because at this moment we are not sure how to handle and apply this idea to phenomenological models .    in this paper , we analyze several types of supersymmetric models by using large n expansion . in this limit , the relation between the effective lagrangian approach with confined hidden sector and nambu - jona - lasinio type approach is clarified . in large n limit , these two correspond to different kinds of approximations of the exact solution .",
    "our main concern is to discuss how the previously mentioned mechanism for dynamical supergravity breaking is realized in the framework of the large n expansion . in section 2 , in order to discuss the applicability of large n expansion in supersymmetric theories , we consider a simple toy model .",
    "this model , o(n ) sigma model , is very useful when one introduces large n expansion in supersymmetric theories . in section 3 ,",
    "we use this method to analyze the dynamical properties of supersymmetric qcd . finally in section 4 , we study the dynamical supersymmetry breaking in a local supersymmetric model . the driving force for gaugino condensation , which is not clear in other approaches ,",
    "is now obvious .",
    "in general effective lagrangian approach , the form of the potential for gaugino condensation is not well defined near the origin(@xmath10 ) and it is difficult to understand how this condensation takes place . on the other hand , in nambu - jona - lasinio type approach or in the large n expansion ,",
    "the potential is given by the wine - bottle and we can easily imagine how fields rolls down to the condensating vacuum .",
    "people generally tend to think that , in supersymmetric theories , no gap equations should exist because the non - renormalization theorem seems to ensure the cancellation of bosonic loops and fermionic ones .",
    "this is true for the superpotential motivated mass terms@xcite , but not applicable to the d - term motivated ones , such as a gaugino soft mass . here , we should remember that n=1 four - dimensional non - renormalization theorem says nothing about the renormalization of d - terms but only about the superpotential renormalization @xcite .",
    "we believe it is very important to show , first of all , that one can find a supersymmetric model in which we can exactly solve the gap - equation by means of large n expansion . here",
    "we examine the phase structures of supersymmetric o(n ) non - linear sigma model in two and three dimensions .",
    "we mainly follow refs.@xcite and @xcite",
    ". some shortcomings of the previous papers on this topic are corrected and deeper insights are given .",
    "many years ago , gross and neveu@xcite have shown that dynamical symmetry breakdown is possible in asymptotically free field theories .",
    "they obtain an expansion in powers of @xmath11 that is non - perturbative in @xmath12 .",
    "this leads to a massive fermion and to a @xmath13 bound state at threshold .",
    "polyakov@xcite has pointed out that the @xmath14 non - linear sigma model is asymptotically free and that the fundamental particle acquires a mass for @xmath15 .",
    "witten @xcite has constructed a supersymmetric version of the two - dimensional o(n ) sigma model .",
    "this is a hybridization of the non - linear sigma model and gross - neveu model with majorana fermions .",
    "then one question appears naturally .",
    "what is the difference between non - supersymmetric models and supersymmetric ones ? if there is any difference , how is it realized ?",
    "many authors tried to answer this question@xcite , but some questionable aspects of arguments are still left .",
    "the purpose of this section is to clarify these ambiguities and present a systematic treatment of this model . to show explicitly what is going on",
    ", we are not going to eliminate the auxiliary fields at the first stage by using the equation of motion .",
    "if we eliminate all the auxiliary fields , it becomes difficult to find what relations we are dealing with .",
    "in this and the next subsections we are going to review the well - known results of o(n ) non - linear sigma model and four - fermion model to fix the notations , and we show the strategy which is used throughout this paper .",
    "the lagrangian for o(n ) sigma model is defined by @xmath16 with the local non - linear constraint @xmath17 the sum over the flavor index j runs from 1 to n. this constraint can be implemented by introducing a lagrange multiplier @xmath18 .",

    "the gap equation can be obtained directly from the constraint equation . here",
    "we call this simple calculation a tadpole method after ref.@xcite",
    ". now let us solve eq.([sigma_gap ] ) . passing to the momentum representation ,",
    "this `` gap equation '' is presented as : @xmath28 this equation is applicable for any @xmath29 dimensions . for d=2",
    ", we can obtain the precise form : @xmath30 for d=3 , the situation differs slightly .",
    "we should include a critical coupling @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 if the coupling is strong(@xmath33 ) , the gap equation has a non - trivial solution at @xmath34 .",
    "( this critical coupling explicitly depends on the cut - off scale @xmath2 , so in three dimensions , we regard this model as a low - energy effective theory of some high - energy physics . of course one may find a good way to remove this cut - off dependence , but here we do not consider such a detailed analysis . )",
    "using @xmath35 , we can rewrite ( [ sigma_gapeq ] ) as : @xmath36 the integral in ( [ gap3 ] ) is convergent .",
    "therefore , we have : @xmath37 if we take @xmath38 something goes wrong with eq.([gap3 ] ) .",
    "it does not have any solution , so the constraint @xmath27 can not be satisfied in this way . to solve this puzzle ,",
    "we should also consider the possibility of spontaneous breaking of o(n ) symmetry .",
    "in above discussions , we have implicitly assumed that the vacuum expectation value of @xmath39 would vanish .",
    "now we consider what will be changed if @xmath39 itself gets a non - zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "because of o(n ) symmetry , the vacuum expectation value of @xmath40 may be written as @xmath41 so that the constraint equation ( [ sigma_gapeq ] ) is changed .",
    "@xmath42 of course , in two dimensions we can not expect @xmath39 to get any expectation value .",
    "considering the spontaneous breaking of @xmath14 symmetry , we introduce another important critical coupling constant @xmath43 . @xmath44",
    "if @xmath45 is smaller than @xmath35 , then @xmath46 grows such that the constraint equation is satisfied in the weak coupling region(@xmath47 ) in a sense that not eq.([sigma_gapeq ] ) but eq.([gapv ] ) is satisfied by some @xmath25 .",
    "there appears , however , a peculiar `` flat direction '' in three dimensions .",
    "as we have seen in the above analysis ( [ gapv ] ) , the constraint equation is satisfied for arbitrary values of @xmath25 and @xmath48 once a certain relation is satisfied by these two variables . to satisfy the constraint equation , @xmath25 and @xmath46 should be related , but one can not fix them at a unique point .",
    "this relation defines the `` flat direction '' of such a peculiar type .",
    "this is because once the constraint equation is satisfied , the potential term should vanish by definition .",
    "as far as we deal with non - supersymmetric sigma model , we have no primary reason to believe that the vacuum expectation value of the field @xmath49 would vanish in the strong coupling region .",
    "the four - fermion model is described by the lagrangian @xmath50 where the sum of the flavor index j runs from 1 to n and we require that @xmath12 remain constant as n goes to infinity . by introducing a scalar auxiliary field @xmath51 ( @xmath52 )",

    "this means that the field @xmath90 gains the same mass as @xmath20 , and simultaneously supersymmetric order parameter @xmath80 vanishes .",

    ", we have nothing to worry about . in this strong coupling region ,",
    "both supersymmetry and o(n ) symmetry are preserved in a fashion like two dimensions . in this region",
    "@xmath46 can not develop any non - zero value because eq.([sv ] ) is also true for the strongly coupled three dimensional theory .",

    "we conclude that , if we believe the validity of the large n expansion , the dynamical masses are unchanged while the supersymmetry breaking parameter develops non - zero value .",
    "the crucial point of our observation lies in the fact that we can absorb the supersymmetry breaking mass term by redefining a field .",

    "the mass difference is always non - zero . in the weak coupling region",

    "determines the relation between @xmath46 and @xmath18 . to go further",

    "can then construct the gaugino induced non - perturbative corrections to the original superpotential of the model . for example , the belief that the condensate dissolves in the weak coupling limit leads to a superpotential which decays exponentially with the increasing value of the dilaton field .",
    "one may then search for minima of the effective theory and determine the true value of the gaugino condensate that leads to the supersymmetry breaking in supergravity theories .",

    "this compensator plays almost the same role as r - symmetry compensator in the global models .      in the standard superfield formalism of the locally supersymmetric action",
    ", we have the lagrangian : @xmath271      + h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we set @xmath272 . in the usual formalism of minimal supergravity",
    ", the weyl rescaling is done in terms of component fields . however , in order to understand the anomalous quantum corrections to the classical action , we need a manifest supersymmetric formalism , in which the weyl rescaling is also supersymmetric .",
    "it is easy to see that the classical action([lag ] ) itself is not super - weyl invariant .",
    "however , the super - weyl invariance can be recovered with the help of a chiral superfield @xmath273(weyl compensator ) .    for the classical action ( [ lag ] ) , the khler function @xmath274 , the superpotential @xmath275 and the gauge coupling @xmath276 are modified in the following way@xcite : @xmath277 @xmath76 is the constant which is chosen to cancel the super - weyl anomaly . the super - weyl transformation contains an r - symmetry in its imaginary part , so we can think that this is a natural extension of @xcite in which a compensator for the r - symmetry played a crucial role in obtaining the gap equation .",
    "let us examine the simplest case .",
    "we include some scale factor @xmath2 and set the form of @xmath275 and @xmath276 as : @xmath278 and rescale the field @xmath273 as : @xmath279 finally we have : @xmath280 the sign of @xmath18 should respect the condition @xmath281 so that the gap - equation can develop non - trivial solution . we can obtain a constraint equation from the equation of motion for the auxiliary component @xmath282 of the super - weyl compensator . the relevant part of the lagrangian is : @xmath283h_{\\varphi}\\ ] ] from the equation of motion , constraint is now written as : @xmath284 for the rescaled field , this can be written as : @xmath285 the tree level scalar potential for this minimal model is : @xmath286 the equation of motion for the auxiliary field([aux0 ] ) suggests that eq.([pot1 ] ) can be interpreted as a four - fermion interaction of the gaugino : @xmath287 this four - fermion interaction becomes strong as @xmath288 reaches 0 .",
    "the strong coupling point is : @xmath289 in the effective lagrangian analysis , one usually assumes that this point is the true vacuum .",
    "we show the vacuum state of three types of analysis(effective lagrangian analysis , g.g.ross type and large n expansion ) in fig.([fig : sugra ] ) .    by using the tadpole method we can obtain a gap equation :",
    "@xmath290 where @xmath76 is determined by the anomaly constraint and @xmath240 is the dimension of the gauge group(@xmath291 ) .",
    "here , it is proportional to @xmath164 .",
    "this equation is a good approximation when we take @xmath292 limit .",
    "( the leading contribution is enhanced by an extra @xmath164 factor .",
    "see fig.([fig : largen_sugra ] )    the solution for the gap equation([g ] ) is plotted in fig.([fig : sugra ] ) .",
    "we can see that there is always a solution for non - zero gaugino condensation .",
    "now let us consider the difference between our result and ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite , the solution for the gap equation",
    "is estimated after fixing the coupling constant at @xmath293 which is introduced by hand .",
    "it is true that the effective potential is singular at @xmath294 ( [ strong ] ) , but without introducing the cut - off for the strength of the four fermion coupling @xmath295 , we can find a stable solution for ( [ g ] ) at finite value.(see fig ( [ fig : sugra ] ) )    for a second example , we include the dilaton superfield @xmath155 .",
    "now @xmath276 is not a constant and depends on the field @xmath155 : @xmath296 and the khler potential for the dilaton superfield is : @xmath297 here we should include the effect of the dilaton field in the scalar potential .",
    "the tree level scalar potential is : @xmath298 the auxiliary field for @xmath155 is : @xmath299\\nonumber\\\\    & = & \\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{4}w\\frac{1 + 12s_{r}\\xi^{-1}}{s_{r}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we set @xmath300 and @xmath301 .",
    "the tree level potential can be given in a simple form @xmath302 where @xmath303.\\ ] ] the tree level potential for @xmath304 has no stable supersymmetry breaking solution .",
    "this is consistent with an observation that gaugino condensation as usually parameterized does not occur in models with a single gauge group in the hidden sector .",
    "however , we have argued that it is essential to go beyond tree level to include non - perturbative effects in the effective potential which may allow non - trivial minimum even in the simplest case of a single hidden sector gauge group .",
    "this non - perturbative sum is readily obtained by computing the one - loop correction to @xmath305 , or directly from the gap - equation . in this case , the gap equation is given by the same constraint equation ( [ aux0 ] ) , but gaugino mass term is modified .",
    "@xmath306 this equation is , however , too complicated to find a solution .",
    "we thus forced to employ some simplification of this analysis , for example , fix the four - fermi interaction coefficient@xcite or to approximate the solution at which @xmath12 goes to infinity , i.e. @xmath307@xcite .",
    "here we only refer to the paper@xcite in which the stability of the potential is well discussed after fixing the four - fermi interaction coefficient . in @xcite , duality invariant lagrangian",
    "is also considered and it is found that this type of approach takes into account some additional non - perturbative effects @xcite and stabilizes the dilaton potential with only one gauge group .    to see the basic mechanism involved ,",
    "let us reconsider eq.([sc ] ) .",
    "this potential suggests that , once gaugino condensate and @xmath273 gets non - zero value , @xmath155 can not run away to infinity . on the other hand ,",
    "it is obvious from fig.([fig : sugra ] ) that eq.([gg ] ) always have non - trivial ( condensating ) solution for any @xmath155 .",
    "moreover , in the effective lagrangian analysis one consider that the point c in fig.([fig : sugra ] ) is the solution for non - trivial gaugino condensation .",
    "as @xmath155 becomes large , c moves toward the origin as the function of @xmath308 so one tends to think that the potential ( [ sc ] ) is destabilized . on the other hand , if one uses nambu - jona - lasinio type approach@xcite , one is lead to the solution b in fig.([fig : sugra ] ) and finds that the potential is indeed stable .",
    "however , taking large n limit , we can find that these two solutions corresponds to different kinds of approximations for the true solution at a , which is different from both b and c. because the solution a is very similar to the solution b and does not behave as @xmath308 , we may think that the potential is stabilized at the true vacuum a.      in this section we have considered the analysis of the non - perturbative properties of supergravity theory which is induced by low energy dynamics of gaugino condensation .",
    "after a brief review of the previous approaches , we examined these known results from another point of view . by using large n expansion , we showed that the effective lagrangian analysis and nambu - jona - lasinio type approach can be regarded as different kinds of approximations to the exact solution .    in the large n limit ,",
    "we can easily understand why the dilaton potential is stabilized in nambu - jona - lasinio type approach but not stabilized in the effective lagrangian approach .",
    "we also found a stable and exact solution in the large n limit .",
    "it is important that we can find a stabilized dilaton potential if we take into account a certain non - perturbative effect from supergravity .",
    "in this paper , we have given a systematic study of the dynamical properties of supersymmetric theories by using the large n expansion .",
    "first we have analyzed the o(n ) non - linear sigma model as the simplest and explicitly solvable example .",
    "all the parameters are determined exactly and no ambiguities are left .",
    "we have also examined the effects of the supersymmetry breaking mass term on the dynamical properties .    for the second example",
    ", we have studied supersymmetric qcd with @xmath0 . what we have been concerned with was the condensation of gaugino which can be viewed as the source of the non - perturbative superpotential .",
    "large n expansion is realized in the limit of @xmath242 while @xmath309 is fixed .",
    "the results almost coincide with the previous analyses@xcite .",
    "we have examined a non - trivial assumption on phase transition for gaugino condensation that was made in ref.@xcite and given alternative proof for it .",
    "we have proved in the large n limit that no phase transition is allowed for gaugino condensation in massive sqcd . however , in massless sqcd , phase transition does occur in the weak coupling region .",
    "this can change the asymptotic form of the runaway potential . to be more precise ,",
    "the flat directions are only partially lifted and does not run away .    for the third example , we have analyzed superstring motivated supergravity theories which is the main theme of our paper . in the large n limit",
    ", we found that the analyses derived from effective ( confined ) theory@xcite and one from nambu - jona - lasinio type approach@xcite correspond to the different kinds of approximations for the exact solution .",
    "( this is explicitly visualized in fig.([fig : sugra ] ) . )",
    "we have used the constituent fields .",
    "this type of approach is very important when we think of the phenomenological implications of supersymmetry breaking mechanism on the moduli stabilization@xcite and the phase transitions in the early universe@xcite .",
    "as is discussed in ref.@xcite , one should discard important part of the non - perturbative effects from supergravity if he considers only a composite type lagrangian that should be obtained by merely turning off the supergravity effects .",
    "we thank k.fujikawa for many helpful discussions .",
    "in this appendix we review the series of papers written by g.g.ross et al@xcite .",
    "the main idea of their analysis comes from an effective low - energy ( still not confined ) theory describing the goldstone mode associated with the r - symmetry breaking driven by gaugino condensation .",
    "this theory has four - fermi interaction at the tree level and they examined its implications to gaugino condensation a la nambu - jona - lasinio type approach .    first ,",
    "let us construct the lagrangian .",

    "the form we have derived depends on the parameters @xmath76 , @xmath312 and @xmath144 .",
    "one can determine @xmath76 by demanding that the low - energy effective lagrangian is anomaly free under the r - symmetry transformation .",
