    "<S> many efforts have been investigated in the past more than one decade to narrow down the spdc photon bandwidth using optical cavities @xcite . however , the bandwidth of spdc polarization - entangled photon pairs is still wider than most atomic transitions and leads to a very low efficiency of storing these polarization states in a quantum memory @xcite .    </S>",
