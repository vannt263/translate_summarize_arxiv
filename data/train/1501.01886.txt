    "the discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider did close a chapter in the history of particle physics .",
    "now , the standard model of particle physics is completed and describes most of the experiments with a great precision .",
    "there are many open questions in particle physics and cosmology which we can not answer in the context of the standard model .",
    "some of these questions are related to the understanding of the baryon asymmetry and the dark matter in the universe .",
    "there are even more fundamental questions related to the origin of all interactions in nature .",
    "one of the most appealing scenarios for high energy physics correspond to the case where a new theory is realized at the tev scale and one could solve some of these enigmas in this context .",
    "the great desert hypothesis is very often considered as a well - defined scenario for physics beyond the standard model . in the great desert picture one has the standard model describing physics at the electroweak scale and a more fundamental theory at the high scale .",
    "this high scale is often related to the scale where there is a grand unified theory or even a theory where the unification of the gauge interactions and gravity is possible . from the low - energy point of view or bottom - up",
    "approach it is important to have an effective field theory which is not sensitive to the unknown physics at the high scale .",
    "it is well - known that in the standard model baryon and lepton numbers are conserved symmetries at the classical level .",
    "however , in our modern view the standard model is just an effective theory which describes physics at the electroweak scale and one should think about the impact of all possible higher - dimensional operators which could modify the standard model predictions .",
    "for example , in the standard model one can have the following higher - dimensional operators @xmath0 where the first operator violates lepton number , the second violates baryon and lepton numbers , and the third breaks the flavour symmetry of the standard model gauge sector .",
    "the experimental bounds demand @xmath1 gev , @xmath2 gev  @xcite , and @xmath3 tev  @xcite , when @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are of order one . since in any generic grand unified theory one generates the second operator due to new gauge interactions , it is impossible to achieve unification at the low scale without predicting an unstable proton and therefore one needs the great desert .",
    "one could imagine a theoretical framework where the second operator is absent , the proton is stable and the unification scale is only constrained by flavour violating processes . in this case",
    "the unification scale must be above @xmath7 tev in order to satisfy all experimental constraints . in this review",
    "we present new theories for physics beyond the standard model where the effective theory at the tev scale predicts a stable proton and the unification scale could be very low .    in the first part of this review we present new extensions of the standard model where the baryon and lepton numbers are local gauge symmetries spontaneously broken at the low scale . in this context",
    "one can define a simple anomaly free theory adding a simple set of fields with baryon and lepton numbers which we call  lepto - baryons \" .",
    "we show that in the spectrum of these theories one has a candidate to describe the cold dark matter in the universe .",
    "we discuss the predictions for direct detection and the constraints from the allowed relic density . using the relic density constraints we find an upper bound on the symmetry breaking scale which tells us that these theories can be tested or ruled out at current or future collider experiments .",
    "the relation between the baryon asymmetry and dark matter density is investigated .",
    "we show that even if the local baryon number is broken at the low scale one can have a consistent relation between the baryon asymmetry and the @xmath8 asymmetry generated through a mechanism such as leptogenesis .",
    "finally , we discuss the possibility to achieve the unification of gauge interactions at the low scale in agreement with the experiment .",
    "in the second part of this review we discuss the main issues in supersymmetric theories related to the existence of baryon and lepton number violating interactions .",
    "we discuss the possible origin of the @xmath9parity violating interactions and show that the simplest theories based on the local @xmath8 gauge symmetry predicts that @xmath9parity must be spontaneously broken at the supersymmetric scale .",
    "we discuss the most striking signatures at the large hadron collider which one can use to test the theory in the near future .",
    "the predictions for the lepton number violating channels with multi - leptons are discussed in detail .",
    "we discuss the main features of this generic mechanism for spontaneous @xmath9parity breaking and the consequences for cosmology .",
    "the theories presented in this review can be considered as appealing extensions of the standard model of particle physics which could be tested in the near future .",
    "the standard model of particle physics describes the properties of quarks , leptons and gauge bosons with great precision at the electroweak scale , @xmath10 gev .",
    "unfortunately , very often when we try to understand the origin of the standard model interactions one postulates the existence of a grand unified theory or another fundamental theory which describes physics at the very high scale , @xmath11 gev . therefore , typically one postulates a large energy gap or desert between the electroweak scale and the new scale @xmath12 .",
    "see fig .  1 for a simple representation of the desert hypothesis in particle physics .",
    "notice that in the desert one could have some  animals \" such as the fields needed for the seesaw mechanism of neutrino masses .",
    "however , in the simplest picture there are only two main energy scales where new theories are defined , the electroweak scale and the unification scale .",
    "unfortunately , if the desert hypothesis is true there is no hope to test the unified theories at colliders or low - energy experiments .",
    "one of the main reasons to postulate the great desert is that in the standard model one can have new dimension six operators which mediate proton decay .",
    "for example , one can write down the following baryon and lepton number violating operator with three quarks and one lepton field , @xmath13 and using the experimental bounds on the proton decay lifetime , @xmath14 years , one obtains a very strong bound on the scale @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 gev .",
    "one can understand the origin of these interactions in the context of grand unified theories .",
    "gev scale , while string theories could be realized at the planck scale . ]",
    "parity violating interactions and the dimension five operators mediating proton decay . in this case",
    "one could describe physics at the tev scale in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and at the high scale a possible supersymmetric grand unified theories or superstring theories could play a role . ]",
    "the simplest grand unified theory is based on the gauge group @xmath17 and it was proposed by h. georgi and s. glashow in 1974  @xcite . in this context one can understand the origin of the standard model interactions since they are just different manifestations of the same fundamental force defined at the high scale .",
    "the desert hypothesis was postulated in the same article  @xcite when the authors realized that the new gauge bosons present in @xmath17 mediate proton decay and generate the dimension six baryon number violating operator in eq .",
    "( [ d6 ] ) . in the context of grand",
    "unified theories the standard model quarks and leptons are unified in the same multiplets",
    ". therefore , the baryon number is explicitly broken at the high scale .",
    "one must mention that the desert hypothesis is also in agreement with the extrapolation of the gauge couplings up to the high scale .",
    "h. georgi , h. r. quinn and s. weinberg  @xcite have shown also in 1974 that the standard model gauge couplings could be unified at the high scale if we assume no new physics between the electroweak and high scales . in 1974",
    "they did not know the values of the gauge couplings with good precision but the main idea was correct .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) has been considered as one of the most appealing theories to describe physics at the tev scale . in this context",
    "the desert hypothesis plays a main role because the unification of the standard model gauge couplings is realized with good precision .",
    "the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite studied the extrapolation of the gauge couplings assuming the great desert , showing that they meet without the need of large threshold effects .",
    "this result has been quite influential in the particle physics community and very often is used as one of the main motivations for having supersymmetry at the low scale .",
    "unfortunately , in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model one finds new interactions which violate the baryon and lepton numbers . in the mssm",
    "superpotential one has the terms @xmath18 where the first three terms violate the total lepton number and the last term breaks the baryon number .",
    "here we use the standard superfield notation for all mssm multiplets .",
    "it is well - known that the last two interactions together mediate the dimension four contributions to proton decay and one needs to impose a discrete symmetry by hand to forbid these interactions .",
    "imposing the discrete symmetry called matter parity defined as @xmath19 one can forbid these interactions . here ,",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the baryon and lepton numbers , respectively .",
    "matter parity is defined in such way that it is equal to @xmath22 for any matter superfield and @xmath23 for any gauge or higgs superfield present in the mssm .",
    "there is a very simple relation between @xmath24-parity and @xmath25-parity , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spin of the particle .",
    "notice that the interactions in eq .",
    "( [ rpv ] ) break the @xmath24-parity discrete symmetry as well and often we refer to these terms as @xmath24-parity violating interactions .",
    "it is important to mention that even if we impose the conservation of @xmath28-parity , still there are interactions which mediate proton decay .",
    "these are the dimension five operators such as @xmath29 in the context of grand unified theories these interactions are mediated by colored fermions and one needs an extra suppression mechanism to satisfy the experimental bounds on the proton decay lifetime .",
    "one can say that in the context of supersymmetric theories these interactions are problematic and even assuming the great desert we need a suppression mechanism .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ desert-2 ] for a naive representation of the desert hypothesis in the case when we have low energy supersymmetry .    as we have discussed before",
    ", the desert hypothesis plays a major role in the particle physics community , and it is often assumed as true .",
    "this hypothesis is very naive and maybe we never will know if it is true because there is no way to test the theories at the high scale .",
    "the only theory we know which describes physics at the electroweak scale is the standard model of particle physics .",
    "then , if we only worry about the theory defined at the low scale , the need to assume a large cutoff is uncomfortable .",
    "this issue tells us that one should think about effective theories defined at the low scale which are free of these baryon number violating operators mediating proton decay .",
    "we have discussed in the previous section that the main reason to assume the great desert between the weak and planck scales is the proton stability . in the renormalizable standard model of particle physics",
    "the proton is stable since the baryon number is broken in three units by the @xmath30 instantons .",
    "however , there are higher - dimensional operators  @xcite of dimension six which are allowed by the standard model gauge symmetry and violate baryon number in one unit .",
    "those operators mediate proton decay and are highly constrained by the experimental bounds . the simplest dimension six baryon number violating operators",
    "are given by        @xmath31    here @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the standard model quarks and leptons .",
    "these operators are generated once we integrate out superheavy gauge bosons present in grand unified theories .",
    "the first two operators are mediated by the gauge bosons @xmath37 , while the last one is mediated by @xmath38 .",
    "these gauge bosons are present in @xmath17 and flipped @xmath17 grand unified theories , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath39 in the above equations are proportional to the inverse of the gauge boson masses squared , @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , using the experimental bounds listed in fig .",
    "[ protonbounds ] one finds naively a very strong lower bound on the mass of the gauge bosons , i.e. @xmath41 gev .",
    "now , since these gauge bosons acquire mass once the grand unified symmetry is broken , the unified scale has to be very large .",
    "this simple result tells us that there is no way to test these theories at collider experiments .",
    "even if proton decay is found in current and future experiments it will be very difficult to realize the test of a grand unified theory .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on grand unified theories and proton decay . for",
    "the possibility to find an upper bound on the total proton decay lifetime see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as one can appreciate , these bounds have dramatic implications for particle physics because the simplest unified theories must describe physics at the high scale and the great desert is needed .",
    "a grand unified theory could be defined at the low scale . however , in this case baryon number should be a local symmetry spontaneously broken at the low scale . in the next section we will discuss the theories with gauged baryon number which predict that the proton is stable and define a new path to low scale unification .",
    "in this section we discuss the simplified models for @xmath42 oscillations studied in ref .",

    "we can produce two charged sleptons through the photon , the @xmath43 and the @xmath8 gauge boson : @xmath44 the sleptons subsequently decay as @xmath45 and finally the neutralinos decay through @xmath46 . in ref .",
    "@xcite has been shown that both of these branching ratios are typically large .",
    "therefore , one can expect a significant number of events with four leptons and two w s .",
