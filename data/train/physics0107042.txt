    "clearly defined spectrum is the main requirement for any spectroscopical methods , which deal with two close isotopes as @xmath1 and @xmath2 , is preferable to use the atomic beams , where it is easy to realize the excitation of single spectral line of @xmath1 or @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "however there are many publications devoted to the general study of lithium vapor in the heat - pipe oven .",
    "there is the doppler broadening of spectral lines .",
    "it is necessary to have a stability and accuracy frequency adjustments of the laser .",
    "usually for lithium atom the single mode laser operation is need with stability and tuning of the laser frequency better then 1 @xmath3 at the resonant frequency . the first known publication with lithium resonance ionization spectroscopy ( ris ) was in 1977  @xcite.there were photo - ionization cross section going from the @xmath4 level and the demonstration of the ion current by varying the dye laser wavelength correspondent to @xmath5 transition .",
    "therefore this was the first work about the possibility of lithium laser isotope separation .",
    "two years later the us patent for lithium laser isotope separation was accepted in 1979  @xcite .",
    "the resonance ionization spectroscopy ( ris ) of lithium use two lasers with different frequencies .",
    "it is depend on intensities of both lasers for resonance excitation at @xmath6 and for the ionization from @xmath4  @xcite ( 1982 ) .",
    "the mixture of two gases in heat pipe usually is present due to chemical activity of lithium contacts with optical windows of the heat - pipe oven .",
    "the ar gas usually is present .",
    "therefore one can to compare ions production by ris in the heat - pipe with another similar method for the @xmath7 contact ionization based on the ion cyclotron resonance ( icr ) isotope separation  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted here that we shall not discuss the effectiveness methods of isotope separation , but on the other hand , both ris and icr can work more successfully at experiments where the concentration of lithium atoms is high . to achieve high values of concentration",
    "it is necessary to increase the temperature of @xmath8 of a vapor chamber with the metallic lithium .",
    "the ion generation process is important for some applications at similar condition of environment .",
    "we consider collisions at the experiment with heat - pipe oven , filled with @xmath7 mixture for such experiment the electromagnetic properties of gas mixture play an important role due to relatively high concentration of charged particles produced by emission , atomic collisions and proper ris for ionization .",
    "the geometric distribution of generated positive and negative particles in the gas chamber is along the way of coaxial laser beams .",
    "if there is no voltage applied to electrodes the small value of electric current is only due to atom - field interaction . because the heat pipe oven has two electrodes with cylindrical symmetry and proper laser is as new cylindrical electrode that produced charged particles along the laser way .",
    "we are going to present : the simplified method for spectroscopic investigation of the dense vapor of @xmath7 mixture , based on methods of atomic collision estimations ; the experimental setup for ionization experiment with lasers , precisely tuned on transition frequency ; the results of electric current measurements .",
    "the ion generation is with both the ris and without it .",
    "last process is most interesting to that the ultra - violet radiation is absent and for achievement of a threshold of ionization is no sufficiently only to excite @xmath5 transition . in both cases",
    "the quantity of the charged particles can appear so large , that it is possible to speak about presence low density plasma  @xcite . the measurement of the excitation and ionization of dense lithium vapor by cw- dye laser with wavelength @xmath9 were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in present work",
    "the result was obtained by using only @xmath10 wavelength .",
    "when the dye laser excite @xmath4-level at 1,848 @xmath11 it can not reach to @xmath12 energy level at 3,879 @xmath11 due to 2,031 @xmath11 difference for two steps excitation and it can lower the ionization potential at 5,391 @xmath11 of @xmath8 atoms .",
    "for this reason we think that there is not a special two - step absorption process , so we will to discuss two mechanisms such as associative reaction and near resonance cooling .",
    "we begin with note that the main problem for such experiments is about the relative values for concentrations of neutral atoms and molecules in the same @xmath8 vapor .",
    "of course , special measurements for molecules or clusters concentration are needed on time ( for @xmath8 molecules studies see e.g. ref  @xcite ) .",
    "the standard experimental absorption intensity spectrum of the @xmath5 of each lithium isotopes has two spectral lines @xmath13 and @xmath14  @xcite with correspondence to level isotope shifts  @xcite .",
    "the lithium @xmath5 has one doublet with distance of 10 @xmath3 ( 0 , 012 @xmath15 ) between @xmath13 and @xmath14 spectral lines .",
    "the isotope shift between @xmath16 ( 670 , 7922 @xmath15 ) and @xmath17 ( 670 , 7764 @xmath15 ) is 10 , 5333 @xmath3 and between @xmath18 ( 670 , 8073 @xmath15 ) and @xmath19 ( 670 , 7915 @xmath15 ) is 10 , 5329 @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "usually the observable at heat - pipe experiment @xmath6 spectrum of natural lithium consists of three lines , where the central line is formed by the superposition of two lines going from two different isotopes  @xcite . at heat - pipe experiments with the dense @xmath8 vapor at high temperature , above 1000 @xmath20 , all gauss lines profiles can not been clearly observed .",
    "there are only three observable normalized profiles of absorption intensity received from experiment and fitted numerically .",
    "the well known picture of the fine structure for each isotope was not at high temperature heat pipe experiment , but particularly was revised with two diode laser for calibration .",
    "the voight profile approach can be applied for simple analysis of the doppler broadened line and for the lorenzian line , which widths are related to the correspondent gauss to lorentz @xmath21 damping constant . with known value of the @xmath21 damping constant from fitted profile , it is easy to obtain the line width for lorentzian profile and evaluate the summary of excitation transfer mechanisms .",
    "also special experiments and theory are needed for detailed investigation of @xmath8 atoms collisions  @xcite -  @xcite .",
    "we use the method based on dense gas absorption intensity spectrum [ fig .",
    "2 ] that can be analytically described by empirical approximation for a voight profile of the absorbed intensity in the beer law , where the absorption coefficient @xmath22 is  @xcite :    @xmath23 \\\\ , \\ ] ]    the absorption coefficient for gauss line profiles is @xmath24 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath24 can be founded numerically from fitted profiles of absorption intensity , because the application of the beer law with absorption coefficient as a constant , which no depend on gauss distribution is no correct for a dense vapor . also at a maximum of one unsaturated line",
    "is possible to compare @xmath24 form fitted spectrum with the same value from the beer law , therefore is possible to use the thickness ( 8,5 @xmath25 ) of dense vapor .",
    "there are two numerical parameters for normalized profile of intensity @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the intensity of the laser .",
    "one of these parameters is @xmath24 , which depend on spectral lines saturation , e.g. for @xmath28 and @xmath29 due to accordingly concentrations .",
    "the @xmath30 is the second numerical parameter .",
    "it dependent on wings of spectral line at frequency @xmath31 , which are far from the central line @xmath32 for both isotopes :    @xmath33    for unsaturated spectral lines , as for left spectral profile in the [ fig .  1 ] , that corresponds to @xmath1 , the parameter @xmath30 leads to the function @xmath34 for the voight profile :    @xmath35    and the @xmath36 damping constant is    @xmath37    the eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) is used only for the fitting @xmath1 spectral lines , because the parameter @xmath30 for @xmath1 is not too large as for @xmath2 , due to the relative concentrations of these isotopes . for @xmath2 isotope spectral line",
    "the saturation is much more greater than for @xmath1 , thus in this case the voight profile must be fitted by using the other sequence :    @xmath38    by fitting the experimental spectrum with above method is possible to obtain a better result with experiment for each spectral line .",
    "also another empirical approximation of voight profile  @xcite can be used successfully for all spectral lines at the narrow part of frequency spectrum .",
    "the @xmath21 damping constants for both @xmath39 and @xmath40 have the same values @xmath41 and both absorption coefficients for @xmath2 and @xmath1 were estimated from fitted spectrum at a fixed temperature .",
    "the relation of two gaussian profiles for @xmath2 and @xmath1 at fixed temperature is :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and resonance frequencies corresponds to wavelength 670,7764 nm for @xmath29 and 670,8073 nm for @xmath28 . at temperature @xmath45 and",
    "pressure @xmath46 , the full width of the half maximum ( fwhm ) is @xmath47 for @xmath39 and @xmath48 for @xmath40 .    for correspondent lorentzian profiles one can easy to calculate the fwhm equal to @xmath49 for @xmath39 and @xmath50 for @xmath40 .",
    "the heat velocity of atoms in the @xmath7 mixture is : @xmath51 also the numerical equation for corresponded temperature dependence is @xmath52 , where the reduction mass is @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , with the temperature about 650 @xmath20 , the random velocity of the @xmath7 atoms vapor is about 160 000 @xmath54 and the correspondent doppler shift for one laser wave is about 16 @xmath3 .",
    "there are some experimental possibilities for measurements .",
    "when the laser has frequency scanning along spectrum of lithium , the relative datum can be used for the line position in the spectrum due to the doppler shift for each wavelengths .",
    "the doppler - free method , that used two opposite propagated beams with the same frequency on the each laser beam is free of the doppler shift for detectors , thus the lorentzian profile can be experimentally received , but only calibrated relative scale of the frequency can be used for estimation of the lorentzian profile .",
    "therefore the 20 @xmath3 scale between known spectral lines captured from the literature datum for @xmath8 is no good for doppler - free experimental estimations of the lorentzian profile in the gas chamber , because expected value of the fwhm is about 100 @xmath55 and special calibration laser air wavelength is needed .",
    "also if the one of two laser beams is controlled by wave meter and another laser is controlled by a power meter or by photo diode with oscilloscope , thus the resolution of the wave meter is about 0,0002 @xmath15 or 133 @xmath55 at 670 @xmath15 and can not permit well accuracy for experiments with a heat - pipe oven where all spectral lines are doppler broadened and saturated . the @xmath5 transition of lithium isotopes is well known for the all 4 principal spectral lines including the fine structures @xmath56 . each atom has the lowest @xmath57 level with two @xmath56 levels , which can be observed only at the special experiment with electric or magnetic fields .",
    "the distance between both @xmath58 levels is 803 @xmath55 for @xmath57 and 18 @xmath55 for @xmath4 level .",
    "yet , we can put fine structures @xmath56 out of our consideration the resonance @xmath5 transition with resonance frequency @xmath59 , because the doppler - free method can not to permit the accuracy experiment with a given transition .",
    "the selection and specification of special designed lasers instrumentation for selective excitation of lithium isotopes and full ionization is important because of the small frequency distance between the lithium lines is present and it is necessary to study some laser spectral stability characteristics .",
    "the experimental setup [ fig .  2 ]",
    "consists of three lasers which path is the same route across the heat - pipe oven .",
    "this is possible by use properties of glan prisms and rotators of polarization .",
    "the lasers wavelength was controlled by a serial pulsed burleigh wave meter model wa 4500 with accuracy 0,0001 - 0,0002 nm at wavelength range from 1100 nm to 400 nm .",
    "the laser line shape was measured by use of a burleigh spectrum analyzer system sa 385 with sa-91 etalon assembly .",
    "its maximum specified resolution is 27 @xmath55 using 8 @xmath3 fsr mirror set with finesse about 300 and the transmission more then 10 as a fabry - perot filter with thermal sensitivity 70 @xmath60 changing in mirrors spacing .",
    "the laser power was measured with a cw - laser power meter , spectra physics , mod 407 a. it has a wavelength range 250 -1100 @xmath15 , power range from 5 @xmath61 to 20 @xmath62 with sensitivity variation about 1 because the damage peak energy density is 0,3 @xmath63 at 50 @xmath64 pulses .",
    "also the 818 uv , newport power meter was used for precisely measured power of low intensity cw - lasers .    for the ionization process we used a high power @xmath65-switched , @xmath66 frequency - doubled nd - yag @xmath67 laser , model @xmath68 .",
    "the power stability was 10 1064 @xmath15 was 15 @xmath62 at 5 @xmath69 repetition rate ( pulse energy 2 , 2 @xmath70 and pulse duration 90 @xmath64 ) and the intensity 3 @xmath71 . in this configuration the second harmonic wavelength ( 532 @xmath15 ) is emitted laterally from the optical axis of the laser resonator .",
    "the shg assembly contains a ktp ( potassium titanyl phosphate crystal ) which is bounced inside a temperature controlled chamber .",
    "because of the small crystal cross section ( 4 x 4 @xmath72 ) , there is a little box for misalignment of the crystal with the nd - yag beam optical center line .",
    "the average power was 2,5 @xmath62 , the average energy was 0,5 @xmath70 and the pulse duration was 100 @xmath64 .",
    "we worked with 1,5 @xmath73 for obtaining uv 266 @xmath15 . for this purpose",
    "we used an @xmath74 temperature stabilized crystal of @xmath75 , obtaining 40 @xmath61 of the average power .",
    "the non - critical phase matching temperature ( 35 @xmath76 - 75 @xmath76 ) is quite dependent on the deuteration level of the @xmath75 .",
    "also the incoming edge of the crystal is at 90 @xmath77 with the optical axis of the crystal and the reflection at the angle about 23 @xmath77 decrease the intensity of 532 @xmath15 about two times .",
    "the lineal polarization of 532 @xmath15 going from the @xmath78 laser had an inclination with the angle 45 @xmath77 respect to the optical path of our experiment .",
    "the specially oriented crystal @xmath75 for second harmonic generation @xmath79 was needed . from two waves within one laser beam with @xmath80 = 532 @xmath15",
    "the well known procedure of the second harmonic generation was used . the wave with @xmath80 = 266 @xmath15 we obtained a uv - beam at 266 @xmath15 with intensity 16 @xmath81 after the prism separation from incoming 532 @xmath15 wave .",
    "the line width of the uv line was 20 @xmath55 with high frequency stability .",
    "frequency stability of the ionization laser is no so critical as for the excitation process , because for ionization we have a transition from @xmath4 to above ionization limit .",
    "the group of calibration lasers consist both the 6202 @xmath82 diode laser and the @xmath83 diode laser with line width about 100 @xmath84 and the average power 6 @xmath61 .",
    "these lasers was used for calibrating the experiment due to high stability parameters at the needed wave length .",
    "we tested a cw - broadband standing - wave spectra physics dye laser ( model 375 b ) , because we can change the mode structure of outgoing laser wave as a special background for given laser equipment  @xcite .",
    "the dye laser was pumped by a power @xmath85 , stability multiline ar - ion laser spectra physics model 2017 -06 s. the ar - ion laser had some measurable spectral lines , such as : at 514,5 @xmath15 with 0,393 @xmath86 , at 496,5@xmath15 with 0,166 @xmath86 , at 488 @xmath15 with 0,285 @xmath86 , at 476,5@xmath15 with 0,109 @xmath86 , at 457,9 @xmath15 with 0,047@xmath86 .",

    "the absorption curve of dcm has an absorbency region between 450 @xmath15 and 550 @xmath15 .",
    "the broad band emission curve has the fwhm about 80 @xmath15 at 650 @xmath15 , which is close to the resonance @xmath5 transition of lithium at 671 @xmath15 .",
    "the spectra physics data for the model 375 b laser were : power 600 @xmath61 at 705 @xmath15 , line width 7 @xmath3 , amplitude stability less then 0 , 5 accuracy of wavelength changing 0 , 5 @xmath15 .",
    "the limit of wavelength changing is in the same order as a rayleigh selection rule for spectral lines @xmath96 , that is about 0,5 @xmath15 for a given laser line width .",
    "we obtained characteristics of spectra physics dye laser , model 375 b , such as : average power 1 , 2 @xmath62 at 671 @xmath15 , accuracy of changing wavelength better then 0,01 @xmath15 and frequency stability about 0,0001 @xmath97 during time of the experiment .",
    "all parameters are depended on needed laser modes structure and corresponds to properties of optical elements inside the resonator . for our experiments with @xmath8",
    "we modified the mode structure and the spectral line width of outgoing laser wave by inserting an additional etalon into a laser resonator .",
    "we note that broadband laser had the tuning accuracy 0,5 @xmath15 without @xmath98 due to @xmath99 frequency tuning accuracy . with @xmath99 and @xmath98 the frequency tuning accuracy was measured @xmath1000,0001 @xmath15 .",
    "the first air spaced etalon @xmath101 had a temperature stability .",
    "when the @xmath99 and @xmath98 were used , the output frequency of the dye laser was tuned to the quite frequency 4,46789597@xmath102 by used the angle and temperature tuning of @xmath98 .",
    "the fsr of output frequency was 19,655 @xmath3 .",
    "then the second etalon @xmath103 , with fsr = 15 @xmath3 was installed inside the cavity and the same operation was repeated with angle tuning of @xmath103 for the same frequency .",
    "the @xmath103 was chosen , because the spectral lines of the lithium have 10 @xmath104 distance twice between 3 spectral lines and laser with @xmath99 and @xmath98 can excite both @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the single mode operation of the broad band laser was achieved .",
    "the single mode selection was realized experimentally [ fig .  2 ] by use the aperture with diameter 1 @xmath105 for transverse mode selection and , by use two etalons @xmath106 and the birefringent filter @xmath107 for longitudinal mode selection .",
    "the mode structure of the single laser beam is very important for selective excitation .",
    "there are some experimental possibilities with the broad band dye laser , which depend on needed experiments .",
    "the sngle mode operation was necessary for a ris experiments .",
    "on the contrary for measured values of electric current [ fig.3 ] of the laser induced low density plasma observation experiment  @xcite , the dye laser had the two longitudinal modes with fwhm 100 @xmath55 , separated exactly at 20 @xmath3 with cavity etalon .",
    "this etalon had the free spectral range ( fsr ) that correspondent the distance between two spectral lines of @xmath28 and @xmath29 isotopes of the natural lithium vapor .",
    "the laser was tuned exactly on 670.8073 @xmath15 for @xmath1 .",
    "another wavelength 670.7716 @xmath15 was not controlled .",
    "the average power at this experiment was 100 @xmath61 .",
    "there are some known methods of longitudinal mode selection by use interferometers techniques as in  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the free spectral range fsr is equal to the distance between two longitudinal modes :    @xmath108    thus , with variation of the angle , some longitudinal modes of the laser will have not losses for correspondent frequencies @xmath109 , ( fsr ) , and it is possible to move the airy spectrum of the etalon along the frequency axis up or down to quite position .",
    "the longitudinal modes are spaced in frequency by @xmath110 .",
    "we note that for near - confocal resonator the free spectral range ( fsr ) is :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 - is the distance from the axis and @xmath113 is the radius of mirrors , when @xmath114 .",
    "thus the series of longitudinal modes are separated by @xmath115 for a cavity with @xmath116 .",
    "transverse modes are important for a mode selection too .",

    "the calculation of the complex degree of coherence of light from an incoherent source , by use the hopkins formula  @xcite , leads to the mirrors diameter 0,32 @xmath121 , where @xmath122- is focal distances , @xmath123 - is the diameter of the source , that dependent on a pumping of the focused laser ( 6 @xmath62 ar - ion laser ) and thermal lens . at flow velocities of the dye about 10 @xmath124 the time of flight for the dye molecules through the focus is about 1 @xmath125 . by using a mirror",
    "whose reflectively can be varied over its surface , it is possible to have some given combination of transverse modes , if it is necessary .",
    "there are two problems of frequency stability of the dye laser .",
    "firstly , we note that the material of installed cavity dye laser etalon was fused silica .",
    "regardless of thickness it has a drift of airspace between fused silica plates about 5 @xmath126 and would have to be temperature stable about 0,1 @xmath127 .",
    "secondly , the environment conditions are very important for stable laser experiment with atomic spectral lines .",
    "therefore , there is the frequency drift :    @xmath128    where ( @xmath129 ) is the cavity length and ( @xmath130 ) is the refraction coefficient . for the quartz rod resonator structure of the dye laser,@xmath131",
    ", we have with respect to the change of a cavity length a resulting temperature sensitivity about 90 @xmath132 .",
    "with respect to the refraction coefficient of air we found a temperature sensitivity about 410 @xmath133 .",
    "the amplitude and frequency stability of the laser was maintained during 3 hours of the experiment .",
    "the wavelength control had the accuracy 0.0001 @xmath15 by use the serial wave meter .",
    "the measured value of the line width was about 100 @xmath55 for cw -regime of dye excitation by use the focused @xmath134 laser .",
    "another excitation of the same dye laser was with 120 @xmath64 pulses of twice doubled nd : yag laser at 266 nm , with 5 @xmath84 pulse repetition and average power about 1 @xmath62 .",
    "output pulses from the dye laser were 100 @xmath64 .",
    "for a known value of the @xmath21 damping constant and absorption coefficient from described method of the fitting we can exam the concentration of the both isotopes :    @xmath135\\frac{1}{a } \\\\ , \\ ] ]    @xmath136\\frac{1}{a } \\\\ , \\ ] ]    where the absorption coefficients given from fitted profiles are @xmath137 for @xmath1 and @xmath138 for @xmath2 .",
    "the correspondent concentration going from above formulas is equal to @xmath139 for @xmath1 and @xmath140 for @xmath2 .",
    "so the relation of two concentrations is @xmath141 = 0.08135 , which is in well agreement with the characteristics of natural lithium  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", one can to verify values of lithium concentration by use the following well known formula for the lithium vapor pressure ( in @xmath142 ) at fixed temperature ( in @xmath20 ) :    @xmath143    where the vapor pressure for given temperature is equal to 0.003427 @xmath144 = 0.0000257 @xmath142 . by using the equation of the state for ideal gas @xmath145 and eq.(10 ) , one can obtain the concentration of the natural lithium , which is equal to @xmath146 . the heat - pipe was filled with @xmath147 gas with the concentration @xmath148 .",

    "the result of ionization by 671 @xmath15 was compared with additional uv laser for ionization from @xmath6 energy level ( 1,848 @xmath11 ) to energy level of ionization limit ( 5,391 @xmath11 ) .",
    "intensity values of both the cw - dye laser and the pulsed uv laser were changed correspondingly to the beam diameter 3 @xmath105 across the heat - pipe oven .",
    "we did not worked with specially applied to the heat - pipe electrodes voltage or load resistors .",
    "direct measurements of the electric current were performed by amper meter ; maximum average value of the electric current was registered about @xmath150 [ fig .  3 ] .",

    "also the capacitance of cylindrical heat - pipe was measured .",
    "the results of the current and capacitance measurements at the temperature higher than @xmath165 are the same for both mechanisms .",
    "also it is easy to separate ris from another ionization using the modulation signal measurements because ris use the pulse uv laser .",
    "if the colliding particles have no charge , the trajectory @xmath166 is assumed to be rectilinear : @xmath167 , where @xmath113 and @xmath168 are the impact parameter and relative velocity .",
    "the elastic collisions change the phase of damped oscillator , @xmath169 , but not the amplitude , @xmath170 , due to the frequency shift @xmath171 during the phase - perturbing collisions .",
    "if the duration of collision , @xmath172 , is short compared with the mean time between two consecutive collisions , one can neglect the radiation during collisions and consider the collisions to be instantaneous .",

    "4 ] , when increase of intensity of the laser , the saturation comes at the maximal size of @xmath178 , that corresponds to the minimal time .",
    "very important the fact of weak growth is that means that the time too gradually decreases aspiring to a limit . on the other hand at a weak intensity the time is very large also grows indefinitely . at the fixed size of intensity of the laser [ fig .  5 ] , the condition of an exact resonance coincides with a condition when time is equally practically to zero and then it is gradually increased to indefinitely in process of a distance from a resonance  @xcite .",
    "if now to put in conformity a parity between frequency @xmath171 of a field and @xmath260 where is the speed of atoms , becomes understandable that now it is possible to speak not only about time of interaction or time of life  @xcite , but also about speeds of atoms , because it is supposed that is possible to replace one ( @xmath171 ) with another ( @xmath261 accordingly .",
    "however , if we can put ( @xmath171 ) as a constant , another @xmath168 is only one part of the distributions function .    when the condition for the near resonant condition is @xmath262 for the quantum interference condition of the em field , then",

    "practically situation is as for one frequency , but with important features [ fig .",
    "6 ] due to a bessel function .    with relation between @xmath266 and the rate @xmath267 all figures becomes clearly observed due to connection of the temperature with the atomic velocity .",
    "other atoms have conserved high velocities . therefore the inelastic collisions should be expected .",
    "the general velocity distribution can be changed and the satellite distribution can be observed due to laser induced collisions between atoms .",
