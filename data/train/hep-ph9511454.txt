    "the heavy quark limit of qcd is of enormous practical use , because with it one may describe a wide variety of heavy hadron decay rates and matrix elements in terms of a small number of parameters .",
    "these parameters reflect nonperturbative qcd effects and can not be computed directly . instead",
    ", they must either be modeled or , preferably , be extracted from experimental data .",
    "one of the most important applications of the analysis of inclusive decays is the determination of the ckm matrix element @xmath4 from the process @xmath6 , which is complementary to the extraction from the exclusive decay @xmath7 .",
    "the computation involves an expansion in powers of @xmath8 , and to @xmath9 there appear three nonperturbative parameters : @xmath2 ( or equivalently , the quark mass @xmath10 ) , @xmath3 , and @xmath11 . while @xmath11 may be extracted directly from the @xmath0@xmath12 mass splitting , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not directly measurable .",
    "two approaches currently popular in the literature are to employ various qcd sum rules to estimate these parameters , and to use an analysis of inclusive semileptonic @xmath1 decay to fix one linear combination of them .",
    "however , each of these methods has a severe disadvantage : the qcd sum rule results are not model - independent consequences of qcd , and the expansions in @xmath13 and @xmath14 may or may not work well at the low scales relevant for @xmath1 decay  @xcite .    in a recent analysis  @xcite",
    ", we calculated the leading perturbative and nonperturbative contributions to moments of the hadronic energy and invariant mass spectra in semileptonic heavy hadron decays .",
    "these predictions are particularly interesting , because experimental information on invariant masses of the hadrons produced in these decays may be derived from the reported branching ratios to exclusive final states .",
    "furthermore , they rest on the same theoretical basis as earlier analyses of other semileptonic quantities such as the decay rate and the lepton energy spectrum  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we performed some preliminary phenomenology based on this theoretical analysis , deriving correlated bounds on the nonperturbative parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in this paper",

    "while the two - loop corrections relating @xmath2 and @xmath3 to the semileptonic decay rate and to the first moment of the invariant mass spectrum in @xmath15 are large , these corrections partially cancel in the relation between the semileptonic decay rate and the first moment of the invariant mass spectrum .",

    "4 .   the theoretical prediction for the _ difference _ of the first moments of the invariant mass spectrum in @xmath1 and @xmath5 decays is well behaved and provides a test of parton - hadron duality .",
    "the comparison with experimental data is quite successful , providing additional evidence for the applicability of duality to the decays of charmed hadrons .",

    "however , it is difficult to relate this extraction of the pole mass to physical quantities .",
    "the radiative corrections in the relation between @xmath23 and the semileptonic charm width are so large that the perturbation series appears uncontrolled ; whether or not this is the case for the relation between the moments of @xmath24 ( from which @xmath25 , and hence @xmath23 , are extracted ) and the charm quark semileptonic width requires a higher order calculation . given this uncertainty ,",

    "therefore , we expect that constraints from the second moment will be more sensitive to higher order corrections than those from the first moment and hence less reliable .",

    "another observable which depends on @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the ratio of partial widths @xmath85 the theoretical expression for @xmath86 also depends on the ratio of masses @xmath87 , both at tree level and in the nonperturbative  @xcite and perturbative  @xcite corrections .",

    "our bounds on @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be translated into bounds on the @xmath111 quark mass @xmath19 .",
    "however , these results should be treated with some caution because the two - loop corrections between @xmath19 and the first two moments of @xmath68 are quite large , indicating a poorly - behaved perturbation series .",
    "we define the dimensionless parameter @xmath112 where we keep only the large @xmath113 contribution to the two - loop term .",

    "however , it is much more difficult to compare these limits to the extraction of the @xmath90 quark pole mass from high moments of @xmath24  @xcite , @xmath123 this is simply because the ambiguity in the renormalization scale introduces a large uncertainty , of order @xmath124mev , in the relation of the `` one - loop '' pole mass @xmath25 to @xmath19 .",

    "in ref .  @xcite it was argued that the semileptonic decays of charmed mesons are not well described in the heavy quark expansion , since the value of @xmath39 which is required to fit the observed semileptonic @xmath1 decay rate lies significantly above 1.4 gev .",
    "this is the upper limit suggested by combining the value of of @xmath10 extracted from the @xmath130 spectrum  @xcite and the large negative value of @xmath3 found from certain qcd sum rules  @xcite .",

    "] instead , we obtain a minimal estimate of the size of the uncertainty arising from these effects by extracting the bounds from @xmath155 in two ways : on the one hand , by solving directly for the width in terms of the charm quark pole mass , and on the other , by proceeding through the intermediate step of calculating the `` decay mass '' @xmath156  @xcite .",
    "these two procedures , which are formally the same only up to order @xmath157 , yield bounds on @xmath2 which differ by approximately @xmath158 . it would be hard to argue convincingly that @xmath154 effects were intrinsically smaller than this . for the analysis of @xmath159 , we employ the simpler procedure of including a term @xmath160 in the theoretical expression ( [ dmom ] ) and varying @xmath161 between @xmath162 and 1 .",

    "[ charml1lbar ] may be interpreted as giving a constraint on @xmath2 derived from a particular process .",
    "a reliable comparison between the constraints derived from two different physical quantities requires that when one is expressed in terms of the other , the perturbative expansion in @xmath65 be well behaved .",
    "for example , we demonstrated earlier that although there are large two - loop corrections to the theoretical expressions for @xmath163 and @xmath49 for @xmath0 or @xmath1 decays alone , these corrections partially cancel out when @xmath2 is eliminated and one of these physical quantities is expressed in terms of the other .",
    "unfortunately , this requirement may no longer be satisfied when expressions from the bottom and charm sectors are compared with each other .",

    "thus while the rough consistency of the constraints from @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays is encouraging , it may not be particularly significant .",
    "still , it is amusing to note that if we were to take the combined constraints as legitimate , then we would conclude that @xmath3 is small and negative , of order @xmath165 gev@xmath21 .",
    "hence it would make a negligible contribution to most observables , including @xmath4 .",
    "we do not compare the results from the charm sector with @xmath166 , which may be extracted from the lattice measurement of @xmath19 using the heavy quark mass relations .",
    "this is because the radiative corrections between these quantities are so large that perturbation theory appears uncontrolled , making it difficult to conclude whether or not the regions in the @xmath67 plane indicated by the different observables are consistent with each other .",
    "a better test of duality in charm decays comes from comparing @xmath1 and @xmath5 decays .",
    "there is only an upper bound on the semileptonic branching ratio of the @xmath5  @xcite , @xmath167 which is not strong enough to provide an interesting constraint from the semileptonic decay rate .",
    "the observed exclusive semileptonic modes are @xmath168 , for which cleo has recently reported relative branching ratios  @xcite . adding the reported systematic and statistical errors in quadrature",
    ", we estimate a value for the first moment of the invariant mass spectrum , @xmath169 we have assumed that decays to @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 saturate the inclusive semileptonic rate , an approximation for which we do not assign an error .",
    "we merely note that since semileptonic @xmath173 decays are known to be saturated by relatively few exclusive modes , the error due to this approximation for @xmath5 might well be small . in light of this uncertainty , the upper limit on @xmath174 is perhaps somewhat less firm than the lower limit .    the theoretical prediction for @xmath174",
    "is given by the expression ( [ dmom ] ) for @xmath175 , with the replacements of @xmath176 by @xmath177 and @xmath2 and @xmath178 by their strange counterparts @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",

    "the leading corrections to this result likely come from the @xmath184 violating cabibbo - allowed annihilation channel in @xmath5 decays .",
    "although this channel typically has small @xmath102 , it contributes to @xmath187 primarily through its effect on the total semileptonic rate . for small lepton mass ,",
    "helicity conservation suppresses the purely leptonic decay @xmath188 in favor of processes in which at least one gluon is emitted . using vacuum saturation to guess the relevant hadronic matrix elements , one obtains a nave estimate of @xmath189 for the fractional correction to the @xmath5 semileptonic decay width .",
    "they obtain the nave estimate above , multipled by a coefficient @xmath190 for @xmath191mev . ] . with @xmath192mev and @xmath193 ,",
    "this corresponds to an increase of order 5% in the semileptonic width of the @xmath5 , or a decrease of @xmath49 by roughly the same percentage .",
    "since the error in this estimate due to the use of vacuum saturation is unknown , we will take the effects of weak annihilation into account by decreasing the predicting for @xmath174 by 5% , and assigning an additional error of @xmath194 , or 100% of the nai \" ve estimate of the @xmath195 correction , to the prediction of the differences in the moments .    with the known values ( [ lamdiffs ] ) of @xmath196 and @xmath197 , the expression ( [ s1diff ] ) reduces to @xmath198\\,{\\rm",

    ", this range leads to @xmath200 , which we may combine with the measured value of @xmath175 to obtain the theoretical prediction @xmath201 this value agrees quite well with the experimental result @xmath202 .    indeed , we view the successful prediction of @xmath187 as evidence for the applicability of parton - hadron duality to inclusive semileptonic charm decays .",
    "the prediction of this moment is on a firmer theoretical footing than other quantities in the charm system , since the large radiative and power corrections up to @xmath203 cancel out of the difference of the moments .",
    "this feature distinguishes this test of duality from those in which a comparison is made to the bottom system , while its relative insensitivity to the value of @xmath2 makes it more stringent than the comparison of the first moment to the total @xmath1 decay width . at the same time",
    ", duality is satisfied in a nontrivial way , as the exclusive final states in @xmath1 and @xmath5 decays are entirely different .",

    ", our discussion of the difference of the first moments in @xmath1 and @xmath5 decays leads us to quite the opposite conclusion : in at least one nontrivial case , duality works well for charm .",
