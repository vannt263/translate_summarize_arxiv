    "the dark matter problem is one of the most fascinating and intriguing issue in the astroparticle physics .",
    "this subject requires theoretical concepts and experimental techniques coming from cosmology , astrophysics and fundamental particle physics .    by definition dark matter is a kind of non luminous matter .",
    "its existence is required by a bunch of striking experimental evidences as well as by some compelling theoretical motivations .",
    "one of most interesting experimental evidences is given by the observations of the spiral galaxy rotation curves  @xcite .",
    "they can be determined well outside the luminous core of the galaxy , measuring the circular velocities of the neutral hydrogen clouds using the @xmath1 cm lines emissions .",
    "the result when expressed as a function of the galactocentric distance @xmath2 is that @xmath3 for large @xmath2 ( in particular for @xmath4 ) rather than the expected @xmath5 . if we suppose that the first newton s law still holds at the galactic scale we must conclude that @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total mass inside a shell of radius @xmath2 . hence there must be a `` dark '' contribution to the galactic mass @xmath8 .",
    "recent measurements  @xcite of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) strongly indicates that the total matter contribution is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "hence @xmath12 is much larger than the baryonic term @xmath13 .",
    "necessarily the dominant matter component must be of a non baryonic form .",
    "it turns out that the best motivated candidates are some kind of weak interacting massive particles ( wimps ) .",
    "usually these type of candidates are stable particles that appear in various extension of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics .",
    "from the theoretical point of view the most interesting extension of the sm involves supersymmetry . here",
    "we will focus in particular on @xmath14 supersymmetric extension of the sm with soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "this is the so called minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "usually the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) that appear in the mssm mass spectrum is a good cdm candidate  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the lsp is often the lightest neutralino .",
    "the four neutralino gauge eigenstates are linear combination of the gaugino and higgsino fields : @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding mass eigenstates can be obtained by diagonalizing the mass matrix : @xmath17 that depends by various mssm parameters , like the gaugino masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( that are associated , in the lagrangian , to explicit supersymmetry breaking terms ) or the @xmath20 parameter that appears in the higgs sector  @xcite . the lowest eigenvalue of the mass matrix in equation  [ neutmassmatrix ] is exactly the lsp , until the so called r - parity is conserved  @xcite .",
    "the neutralino is a majorana fermion , so it coincides with its own antiparticle , and it is a weak interacting particle .",
    "the r - parity conservation implies that the lightest neutralino can not decay in sm particles and so it is a stable particle . for these reasons",
    "the neutralino is a good cdm candidate .",
    "moreover a neutralino pair can self annihilate into various sm particles that we can detect .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the neutralino is a good cdm candidate .",
    "it is possible to study its properties through indirect detection of cosmic rays coming from pair annihilations in the dark galactic halo . in particular here we focus on the cosmic @xmath0-rays from the galactic center ( gc ) .",
    "the egret data from the gc @xcite give a strong indication of an excess with respect of the `` standard '' model production of @xmath0-rays @xcite . in the standard picture , the diffuse @xmath0-ray background is due to the following processes :    * @xmath21 production that promptly decays in @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are primary protons and heliums and @xmath26 is the interstellar hydrogen or helium . *",
    "bremsstrahlung * inverse compton    we are only interested in the energy range above @xmath27 gev where the dominant component is by far the @xmath21 production .",
    "in the subsequent analysis we consider only this component for the diffuse background .",
    "we want to explain the gc excess adding a neutralino induced component in the @xmath21 production .",
    "the leading intermediate annihilation channels for the @xmath21 production , through fragmentation and/or decay processes , are often @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see figure [ feynman - diag ] ) .",
    "this is valid not only for the neutralino but also for a generic majorana fermion wimp , as for such particles the s - wave annihilation rate into lighter fermions is suppressed by a factor @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the final state fermion mass and @xmath34 is the wimp mass .            we can write the total diffuse @xmath0-ray flux as a sum of two components : @xmath35 where the background flux @xmath36 is splitted into two factors : @xmath37 where @xmath38 ( measured in @xmath39 ) is the local emissivity per hydrogen atom . the neutralino induced component @xmath40 is given by  @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the detector angular acceptance and where we have introduced the dimensionless function j that contains the dependence on the dark halo density profile : @xmath43 we have introduced the unknown normalization factor @xmath44 in order to take into account our ignorance of the exact hydrogen column density , _",
    "i.e. _ the interstellar medium , while the @xmath45 factor parametrize our ignorance of the dark matter halo model .",
    "results from n - body simulations  @xcite@xcite give for for the dark matter density : @xmath46^{\\left(\\beta -\\gamma\\right)/\\alpha}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath0 are parameters that describe the halo profile ( isothermal sphere , nfw , moore , .. ) , @xmath49 is the wimp density measured here and @xmath50 is the galactocentric distance .",
    "having introduced the neutralino induced component the fit of the gc egret data greatly improves . in the context of a simplified _ toy model _",
    "@xcite , valid for a generic majorana fermion wimp of mass @xmath34 and with a fixed dominant intermediate annihilation channel , the result is shown in figure  [ egretdata - fit ] .",
    "gev ) induced component with @xmath30 dominant annihilation channel .",
    "the best fit parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are indicated in the upper right corner . ]",
    "our analysis shows that the egret data fit improves for small neutralino masses . in order to extract much more information about the gc egret excess we have to wait for the upcoming generation of telescope satellite , like glast  @xcite . with respect to egret",
    ", glast has a wider energy range , increased effective area and better energy and angular resolution .",
    "hence we have studied what kind of data glast would collect from the gc , under the hypotesis that the excess , as mapped by egret , is due to wimp annihilations . relying on a simplified picture of the glast detector performances ( energy resolution of about @xmath51 , angular resolution of @xmath52 sr and peak effective area of @xmath53 ) , we have computed the gc data set which will be obtained by glast in 2 years . we have superimposed the error bars associated to the statistical errors only for the chosen energy binning and with an angular acceptance of @xmath54 .",
    "the result , in this case , is shown in figure  [ egretdata - glast ] .",
    "all the previous results are valid in the case of a generic wimp . at the end",
    "we want to identify the neutralino as our wimp candidate .",
    "to do so we must consider a `` realistic '' supersymmetric model , _",
    "i.e. _ the mssm .",
    "in order to reduce the number of free parameters of the mssm it is possible different supersymmetry breaking scenarios in which the supersymmetry breaking terms derive from an underlying high energy theory .",
    "one of the most widely studied frameworks is the so - called minimal supergravity ( msugra ) or constrained mssm ( cmssm )  @xcite . in the msugra model there is an important assumption about the _ universality _ of all the coupling constants at the grand unification scale ( gut ) . with these constraints",
    "the number of free parameters is only five : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the common scalar mass , @xmath57 is the common gaugino mass and @xmath58 is the proportionality factor between the supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings and the yukawa couplings .",
    "@xmath59 denotes the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral components of the su(2 ) higgs doublet , while the higgs mixing @xmath20 is determined ( up to a sign ) by imposing the electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) conditions at the weak scale . in this context",
    "the mssm can be regarded as an effective low energy theory .",
    "the parameters at the weak energy scale are determined by the evolution of those at the unification scale , according to the renormalization group equations ( rges ) .",
    "fixing @xmath59 , @xmath58 and @xmath60 we have performed an accurate scan in the @xmath61 msugra parameter space , looking for the minimum normalization factor @xmath45 needed to be able to single out the neutralino annihilation signal with glast . in this case",
    "we have taken advantage of the better glast angular resolution ( @xmath62 ) with respect to egret . in this deeper analysis",
    "we have also computed the neutralino relic density : @xmath63 solving the boltzmann equation that describes the time evolution of the neutralino number density @xmath64 : @xmath65\\ ] ] this equation can be easily solved numerically including resonances , threshold effects and all possible coannihilation processes  @xcite .",
    "the results , for two possible choices of the parameters @xmath59 , @xmath58 and @xmath60 , are shown in figure  [ msugra - plots ] .",
    "plane , for the value of the normalization factor @xmath45 , that allows the detection of the neutralino @xmath0 ray signal , with glast .",
    "the light shaded region corresponds to the cosmologically favoured region where @xmath66 , while the dark shaded one corresponds to models that are excluded either by incorrect ewsb , lep bounds violations or because the neutralino is not the lsp.,title=\"fig : \" ]   plane , for the value of the normalization factor @xmath45 , that allows the detection of the neutralino @xmath0 ray signal , with glast .",
    "the light shaded region corresponds to the cosmologically favoured region where @xmath66 , while the dark shaded one corresponds to models that are excluded either by incorrect ewsb , lep bounds violations or because the neutralino is not the lsp.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the contour plots , in the msugra @xmath61 plane , show the normalization factor @xmath45 needed for glast detection , at @xmath67 level , of the neutralino induced @xmath0 ray signal .",
    "we have performed an analysis of the possibility of an indirect detection of supersymmetric dark matter with cosmic @xmath0-rays .",
    "the most important indication is that there is indeed room for supersymmetric dark matter in the already available @xmath0-ray data from egret .",
    "moreover the computation of the expected @xmath0-ray flux coming from dark matter annihilation with upcoming detector glast shows that it will be possible to study in more details a supersymmetric signal .",
    "this work has been performed in collaboration with alessandro cesarini , francesco fucito and aldo morselli in roma tor vergata university and with piero ullio at sissa in trieste .",
