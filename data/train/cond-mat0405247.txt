    "cells in a multicellular organism adhere to each other and to the extracellular matrix through a large variety of different receptor - ligand bonds @xcite .",
    "although not probed this way in traditional affinity experiments , adhesion bonds in physiological situations usually have to function under mechanical load .",
    "for example , cell - matrix adhesion in connective tissue is mainly provided by focal adhesions , which are based on transmembrane receptors from the integrin family connecting the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix .",
    "focal adhesions of fibroblasts , the main cell type in connective tissue , are usually loaded by actomyosin contractility , in particular during tissue maintenance and wound healing .",
    "an important class of adhesion contacts in endothelial sheets are adherens junctions , which are based on transmembrane receptors from the cadherin family connecting the actin cytoskeletons of different cells .",
    "endothelial tissue often is subjected to considerable external stress and strain , for example in lung and blood capillaries .",
    "leukocytes circulating with the blood flow tether to and roll on vessel walls through transmembrane receptors from the selectin family connecting the actin cytoskeleton to carbohydrate ligands on the opposing surface . here",
    "contact dissociation is accelerated due to the shear flow pulling on the cells . in general",
    ", there are many more physiological conditions in which adhesion clusters are subject to forces arising from intra- or extracellular processes , including cell motility , development and angiogenesis .    during recent years",
    ", the behavior of different adhesion bonds under force has been investigated extensively on the level of single molecules by dynamic force spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this field has been pioneered by afm - experiments by the gaub group @xcite and later put onto a firm theoretical basis by evans and ritchie @xcite . because bond rupture can be modeled in the framework of kramers theory as thermally assisted escape over one or several transition state barriers ,",
    "bond strength is a dynamic quantity which depends on loading rate .",
    "experimentally , this prediction has been impressively confirmed for different molecular systems @xcite .",
    "dynamic force spectroscopy has been implemented with different experimental techniques , including atomic force microscopy @xcite , laser optical tweezers @xcite and the biomembrane force probe @xcite .",
    "the behavior of molecular bonds under force can also be probed in parallel plate flow chambers .",
    "here usually the loading process is much faster than bond dissociation , which therefore effectively occurs under constant load @xcite . by now",
    ", dynamic force spectroscopy has shown that adhesion bonds feature a much more complicated behavior under force than suggested by the traditional affinity experiments in solution @xcite . using concepts from the theory of stochastic dynamics @xcite , a binding energy landscape",
    "can be reconstructed from the experimental data . during recent years",
    ", this has been accomplished for many different adhesion receptors , including integrins @xcite , cadherins @xcite and selectins @xcite . however , while dynamic force spectroscopy up to now has mainly been applied to single bonds , in physiological settings adhesion receptors usually operate cooperatively within clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore the physical description of single adhesion bonds under force now has to be extended to clusters of adhesion bonds under force .",
    "clusters also open up the possibility of rebinding of broken bonds , which is known to be essential to achieve physiological lifetimes of adhesion clusters .",
    "for single bonds , rebinding usually can not be studied due to elastic recoil of the force transducer after bond rupture @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for adhesion clusters open bonds can rebind as long as other bonds are closed , thus keeping the spatial proximity required for rebinding .",
    "only if the completely dissociated state is reached , rebinding becomes impossible and the cluster disintegrates as a whole .",
    "although it is clear that force leads to accelerated cluster dissociation , it is usually not known how it is distributed over the different closed bonds in different situations of interest . in many cases ,",
    "most prominently in rolling adhesion , only few of the different bonds are loaded to an appreciable degree , thus dissociation occurs in a peeling fashion @xcite .",
    "however , due to geometrical reasons , even in this case there will be a subset of bonds which are loaded to a similar extend . in the same vein",
    ", the loading situation at focal adhesions can also be expected to be rather complicated . for the case of",
    "homogeneous loading , one further has to distinguish between loading through soft and stiff springs @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "all bonds are equivalent and a mean field description can be applied @xcite . in the first case",
    ", force is shared equally between all closed bonds and the coupling between the different bonds in the adhesion cluster is non - trivial .",
    "recently , dynamic force spectroscopy has been applied to this case for the first time @xcite . here",
    ", a vesicle functionalized with appropriate ligands is sucked into a micropipette and pressed onto a cell . on retraction ,",
    "the vesicle is peeled off from the outside to the inside of the contact region .",
    "however , due to rotational symmetry around the micropipette axis , all bonds in a ring around the periphery of the contact area share the homogeneous loading .",
    "the equilibrium properties of adhesion clusters has been theoretically studied before @xcite , mainly in reference to experiments on vesicle adhesion through specific ligand - receptor pairs @xcite .",
    "for the non - equilibrium dissociation of adhesion clusters under force , a deterministic model has been introduced in a seminal paper by bell @xcite .",
    "this model has been mainly used to study more specific problems , for example leukocyte rolling in shear flow @xcite .",
    "recently , the deterministic bell - model has also been extended to treat linear loading of a cluster of adhesion bonds , which usually is applied in dynamic force spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "a stochastic version of the bell - model has been introduced , but studied only in the large system limit and for specific parameter values @xcite .",
    "later the stochastic model has been treated with reliability theory in the special case of vanishing rebinding @xcite .",
    "other special cases of the stochastic model have been treated in order to evaluate specific experiments , for example the binding probability between ligands and receptors on opposing surfaces as a function of contact time @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use the stochastic version of the bell - model to study the case of constant shared loading in comprehensive detail .",
    "in contrast to applications to specific experiments , we focus on generic features of the stochastic dynamics of a cluster of parallel bonds under shared constant loading and with rebinding . a short report on our main results has been given before @xcite .",
    "as shown elsewhere , the same stochastic framework as used here for the case of constant loading can also be used to study the case of linear loading @xcite .",
    "compared with the deterministic model , the stochastic model has several advantages : first , only the stochastic model allows to treat the experimental situation that rebinding becomes impossible once the completely dissociated state has been reached .",
    "second , it includes fluctuations and non - linear effects , which are important for small adhesion clusters .",
    "third , using the well - developed theory on master equations , the stochastic model allows to derive analytical results for cluster lifetime as a function of cluster size , rebinding rate and force , which are very helpful in evaluating adhesion experiments , including rolling adhesion @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we consider the situation in which a certain number of bound adhesion receptors has been clustered and connected to some force - bearing structure .",
    "we then ask how strongly the force accelerates dissociation , and in which sense dissociation can be balanced by rebinding . since we are concerned with generic features of contact stability , our model does not consider spatial or concentration degrees of freedom .",
    "in , we define the stochastic variant of the deterministic bell - model , which has three dimensionless parameters",
    ". next we introduce the appropriate one - step master equation describing the stochastic dynamics of an adhesion cluster under shared constant force and with rebinding .",
    "we also explain how this master equation can be solved numerically with the gillespie algorithm for exact stochastic simulations . in the two following sections , we discuss two special cases of the model in which considerable analytical progress can be made . in each case",
    ", we first discuss deterministic results , and then turn to the full stochastic model . in , we discuss the case of vanishing rebinding . in this case ,",
    "broken bonds can not be reformed and the number of closed bonds in the adhesion clusters decreases in a unique sequence of rupture events .",
    "this can be used to construct a solution for the master equation and to derive an expression for the average lifetime of an adhesion clusters . in",
    ", we discuss the case of vanishing force . in this case",
    ", we deal with a linear problem and analytical solutions of the master equation can be derived for a reflecting boundary .",
    "they can be used in turn to derive an approximation for the case with an absorbing boundary .",
    "cluster lifetime can be calculated exactly as mean first passage time using laplace techniques . in",
    "we consider the general case with finite rebinding and finite force .",
    "although full analytical solutions are only feasible in the case of small clusters , cluster lifetime can be calculated exactly for arbitrary cluster size . for larger clusters ,",
    "full solutions of the master equation are obtained by exact stochastic simulations .",
    "simulations are also essential to characterize single unbinding trajecories and to understand the role of fluctuations .",
    "we close in with a discussion of experimental issues .",
    "fig1schematic representation of an adhesion cluster under constant shared force : there are @xmath0 receptor - ligand pairs , @xmath1 of which are closed and equally share the load @xmath2 . a closed bond ruptures with the dissociation rate @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath4 open bonds rebind with the force - independent association rate @xmath5 .",
    "our model has three parameters : cluster size @xmath6 , dimensionless rebinding rate @xmath7 and dimensionless force @xmath2 .",
    "the rupture of molecular bonds can be modelled in the framework of kramers theory as thermally activated escape over a transition state barrier @xcite . assuming an infinitely sharp transition state barrier leads to the so - called _ bell equation _ for the single molecule dissociation rate as a function of force , @xmath8 @xcite . here",
    "the force scale @xmath9 is set by thermal energy @xmath10 and the distance @xmath11 between the potential minimum and the transition state barrier along the reaction coordinate of rupture . for a typical value @xmath12 nm and physiological temperature @xmath13 k ,",
    "we find the typical force scale @xmath14 pn .",
    "physiological loading has indeed been found to be in the pn - range , both for cell - matrix adhesion @xcite and rolling adhesion @xcite .",
    "values for @xmath15 and @xmath16 have been measured during recent years with dynamic force spectroscopy for different receptor - ligand systems , including integrins @xcite , cadherins @xcite and selectins @xcite . while the dissociation rate @xmath17 depends mainly on the internal structure of a bond , the association rate @xmath5 includes the formation of an encouter complex and",
    "therefore depends on the details of the situation under consideration .",
    "it is very difficult to determine @xmath5 experimentally , especially in the case of cell adhesion , when the interacting molecules are anchored to opposing surfaces @xcite . in order to focus on the generic features of cluster stability , here",
    "we assume that @xmath5 is a force - independent constant , in accordance with earlier theoretical work @xcite .",
    "future modelling might refine this assumption , considering for example the effect of ligand - receptor separation controlled by polymeric tethers @xcite .    for the following ,",
    "it is convenient to use dimensionless quantities .",
    "we define dimensionless time @xmath18 , dimensionless force @xmath19 and dimensionless rebinding rate @xmath20 .",
    "the dimensionless single molecule dissociation rate is @xmath21 .",
    "we consider a cluster with a constant number of @xmath6 bonds , which initially are all closed and then undergo rupture and rebinding according to the appropriate rates .",
    "since bond rupture is a discrete process , the stochastic dynamics of the bond cluster can be described by the one - step master equation @xcite @xmath22 p_i\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the probability that @xmath24 bonds are closed at time @xmath25 . here",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the reverse and forward rates between the possible states @xmath24 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "they follow from dissociation and association rates of single bonds as @xmath29 our model has three parameters , namely cluster size @xmath6 , rebinding rate @xmath30 and force @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath31 should be guaranteed at any time , @xmath32 has to be set for @xmath33 , in addition to the definitions in .",
    "moreover , implies @xmath34 , that is , after rupture of the last closed bond new bonds are allowed to form .",
    "this corresponds to a reflecting boundary of the master equation at @xmath35 . as explained above , in biological and biomimetic situations rebinding of the completely dissociated state",
    "is usually prevented by elastic recoil of the transducer .",
    "therefore in the following we set @xmath36 in order to model an absorbing boundary at @xmath35 .",
    "because the values for @xmath37 and @xmath38 do not follow the general form given in , the boundary at @xmath39 is an _ artificial _ boundary .",
    "concerning the upper end of the set of states at @xmath40 , the form @xmath41 represents a reflecting boundary and guarantees @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the upper boundary is a _",
    "natural _ boundary of the master equation .",
    "a quantity of large interest is the average number of closed bonds @xmath43 . from the master equation one can derive @xcite @xmath44",
    "if @xmath45 and @xmath46 were both linear functions in @xmath24 , would become an ordinary differential equation for @xmath47 .",
    "this suggests to study the deterministic equation @xmath48 as has been done by bell @xcite . below",
    "we will see that the analysis of this equation gives valuable insight into the generic features of our model .",
    "however , it is important to note that for @xmath33 , the reverse rate @xmath45 in is non - linear in @xmath24 and the average in can not be taken .",
    "instead lower moments are related to higher moments and one arrives at a complicated hierarchy of coupled differential equations .",
    "the solution of the deterministic equation will therefore deviate from the average number of closed bonds obtained from the solution of the master equation .",
    "the same problem arises for the higher moments .",
    "for example , for the variance @xmath49 one can derive @xcite @xmath50 where again the average can not be taken . as an approximate treatment",
    ", one can expand @xmath45 in a taylor series around the average for @xmath24 , @xmath51 @xcite . restricting the expansion to second order , thus assuming a gaussian distribution , leads to the following equations @xmath52 in principle , these equations can be solved by numerical integration .",
    "however , it is much more instructive to consider the original master equation .",
    "moreover , the deterministic equation and its improved version can not describe the effect of an absorbing boundary at @xmath35 . in order to consider this experimentally relevant case",
    ", one has to study the master equation with the rates given in .",
    "finally , only the full stochastic analysis reveals the detailed effect of fluctuations .      below we will present analytical solutions for several special cases of the master equation . in the general case",
    ", we numerically solve the master equation by monte carlo methods . in detail , for each set of parameter values @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath30 , we generate between @xmath53 and @xmath54 trajectories with the help of the gillespie algorithm for exact stochastic simulations @xcite . by averaging for given time @xmath25 over the different simulation trajectories , we obtain the desired probability distributions @xmath55 . in general",
    "it is also rather instructive to study single simulation trajectories , because their specific features are expected to be characteristic also for experimental trajectories .",
    "the gillespie algorithm was originally developed for exact simulation of the stochastic dynamics of coupled chemical reactions .",
    "applied to our case , open and closed bonds correspond to two different species of molecules and the transition between these two species , that is rupture and rebinding , correspond to chemical reactions .",
    "the gillespie algorithm is very efficient because rather than discretizing time in small steps , it generates jumps between subsequent reactions .",
    "the basic quantity of the gillespie algorithm is the probability @xmath56 that the next reaction occurs in the time interval @xmath57 $ ] and is of type @xmath58 under the condition that at time @xmath59 the system is in state @xmath60 . in our case ,",
    "@xmath58 has only two values corresponding to rupture and rebinding , and the state @xmath60 of the system is completely described by the number of closed bonds @xmath24 . since the rupture and rebinding rates from are constant between subsequent events , @xmath61 does not depend on absolute time @xmath59 .",
    "in fact it reads @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the probability that no reaction occurs in the time interval @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 is the reaction rate for reaction @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath63 satisfies the differential equation @xmath66 and the initial condition @xmath67 , therefore @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 is properly normalised to unity as can be shown by integrating over time and summing over reactions .",
    "the gillespie algorithm generates trajectories in which subsequent reactions are separated by the following rule . in the absence of other reactions ,",
    "the probability for a reaction @xmath58 in the time interval @xmath70 $ ] is given by @xmath71 the integral @xmath72 is the probability for a reaction occuring until time @xmath25 .",
    "it increases strictly monotonically from @xmath73 to unity and thus can be inverted . in order to generate a random variable @xmath74",
    "which is distributed according to , one generates a random number @xmath75 which is uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath76 $ ] and inserts it into the formula @xmath77 this is done for each type of reaction , leading to a set of times @xmath74 .",
    "the time for the next reaction is then chosen as the smallest @xmath74 , that is @xmath78 . as shown in @xcite , this rule generates trajectories with the correct distribution of times and types of subsequent reactions . with the forward and reverse rates for rebinding and unbinding of molecular bonds in the cluster , the random times are determined by the functions @xmath79 this algorithm is exact in the sense that the only sources of inaccuracy lie in the choice of the random number generator and the finite number of trajectories used to calculate probability distribution .",
    "we start our analysis with the case of vanishing rebinding , @xmath80",
    ". then the deterministic equation reads @xmath81 in principle , the total number of bonds @xmath6 is irrelevant in this case .",
    "however , it is reintroduced through the initial condition @xmath82 . then is solved implicitly by @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the exponential integral .",

    ", we use the small argument expansion of the exponential integral , @xmath90 ( where @xmath91 is the euler constant ) , and find @xmath92 this corresponds to the familiar case of radioactive decay , when the differential equation @xmath93 leads to exponential decay @xmath94 .    for intermediate force ,",
    "@xmath95 , we can rewrite for the cluster lifetime as the sum of two integrals , @xmath96 the second integral can be estimated to be @xmath97 .",
    "for the first integral , we can expand the integrand for small arguments , leading to @xmath98 .",
    "since @xmath99 , the second integral can be neglected and we have @xmath100 for the time evolution of the cluster , both exponential integrals in can be replaced by the small argument approximation as long as @xmath101 and hence the exponential decay proceeds until the force per bond is @xmath102 . thereafter the decay will be faster than exponential due to the destabilizing effect of force .    for large force , @xmath103 , the second term in can be neglected and we can use the large argument approximation for the exponential integral , @xmath104 , leading to @xcite @xmath105 therefore cluster lifetime decays faster than exponential with @xmath106 in this regime . now the small argument approximation is not applicable to either of the two terms in and the decrease in @xmath47 will be faster than exponential over the whole range of time .    in summary ,",
    "the analysis of the deterministic equation allows to identify three scaling regimes of small , intermediate and large force .",
    "this analysis also shows that @xmath107 is an important scaling variable , which we will therefore use to analyse also the stochastic case .",

    "therefore the master equation in general can not be solved with standard techniques . however , in the case of vanishing rebinding , @xmath80 , one can use the fact that the decay of the cluster corresponds to a unique sequence of events , with the number of closed bonds decreasing monotonously from @xmath6 to @xmath73 . the transition from state @xmath24 ( with @xmath24 closed bonds present ) to the state @xmath114 ( with one more broken bond ) is a poisson process with the time - independent rate @xmath26 .",

    "all other cases have been treated with exact stochastic simulations using the gillespie algorithm , which for large clusters is more efficient than the eigenvalue analysis . moreover",
    ", the study of single simulation trajectories offers valuable insight into the typical nature of unbinding trajectories expected for experiments .",

    "regarding mean cluster lifetime , the deterministic treatment is rather good in the case of vanishing rebinding , although it underestimates the plateau value for cluster lifetime at small force . in the presence of rebinding",
    ", the deterministic treatment fails , because it includes neither the effect of fluctuations nor the effect of an absorbing boundary . in particular ,",

    ", when rebinding becomes irrelevant , does the deterministic treatment work well again . regarding the average number of closed bonds",
    ", the deterministic model fails because it does not correctly treat the non - linearity in the rupture rate .",
    "this effect is most evident for small clusters and at late stage of rupture . in general , the mean number of closed bonds in the stochastic model decay in a smoother way than in the deterministic model , which typically shows an abrupt decay in late stage .",
    "this abrupt decay in fact is typical for shared loading and shows up in the stochastic model when one studies single simulation trajectories . in this sense",
    ", the deterministic model makes an interesting prediction which should be confirmed in experiment , albeit not on the level of the first moment , as suggested by the deterministic model , but rather on the level of single trajectories , as suggested by the stochastic model .",

    "the stochastic dynamics of adhesion clusters under force can be quantitatively studied with many different techniques , including atomic force microscopy , optical tweezers , magnetic tweezers , the biomembrane force probe , flow chambers , and the surface force apparatus . in all of these cases , by measuring cluster lifetime @xmath178 and two out of the three parameters @xmath6 , @xmath2 and @xmath30 , the third parameter can be estimated with the help of our exact results . in general , our exact results nicely show how mean cluster lifetime @xmath178 varies with cluster size @xmath6 , force @xmath2 and rebinding rate @xmath30 .",
    "for example , if the single bond lifetime was one second ( @xmath422 ) , for @xmath110 and @xmath80 a cluster lifetime @xmath178 of one minute could only be achieved with @xmath423 bonds , because in this case , cluster lifetime scales only logarithmically with cluster size . however , for a rebinding rate @xmath250 ( @xmath424 ) , only @xmath109 bonds are necessary , because lifetime scales strongly with rebinding , @xmath425 .",
    "increasing force to @xmath112 would decrease lifetime to @xmath426 s , because @xmath178 is exponentially decreased by @xmath2 . to reach one minute again ,",
    "cluster size or rebinding rate had to be increased such that @xmath390 .",
    "this implies @xmath427 or @xmath428 .",
    "it is important to note that these predictions are based on the assumption of rigid force transducers . in many experimental situations of interest",
    ", the force transducer will be subject to elastic deformations or even to viscous relaxation processes , like for example when pulling on cells @xcite . in order to focus on generic aspects of adhesion clusters , here",
    "we only studied the minimal model for stochastic dynamics under force .",
    "our results can also be applied to experiments in cell adhesion .",
    "for example , the biomembrane force probe with linear loading has recently been used to study the decay of @xmath429-integrin clusters induced on the surface of endothelial cells @xcite . if one makes sure that the clusters do not actively grow during the time of dissociation , similar experiments could now be done also for constant loading . because in these kinds of experiments the exact cluster size is usually unknown , one had to convolute our results with a poisson distribution for an estimated average number of bonds @xcite . recently , our result for the average cluster lifetime of two bonds under shared force and with rebinding , , has been applied to the analysis of flow chamber data on leukocyte tethering through l - selectin @xcite . since in this case force can be calculated as a function of shear flow , our formula can be used to the estimate rebinding rate , which in this case turns out to be surprisingly large .",
    "this in turn explains why dissociation dynamics in l - selectin mediated leukocyte tethering appears to be first order : for large rebinding , the leakage approximation is rather good , and decay is exponential .",
    "our results can not be directly applied to adhesion clusters which compensate for force - induced decay by active growth , as it has been found experimentally for focal adhesions @xcite .",
    "yet there are also interesting lessons for focal adhesions which can be learned from our model .",
    "for example , our stochastic analysis confirms the prediction from the deterministic stability analysis that cluster stability changes strongly around the critial value @xmath304 ( although small clusters tend to decay also at smaller force due to fluctuations towards the absorbing boundary ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent experiments measuring internally generated force at single focal adhesions suggest that @xmath150 , the most important scaling variable of our analysis , is roughly constant for different cell types @xcite . it is therefore tempting to speculate that focal adhesions ( or subsets of focal adhesions ) are regulated to be loaded close to the critical value @xmath430 from",
    ". in this way",
    ", cells could quickly increase force on single bonds by small changes in actomyosin contractility .",
    "large force on single closed bonds in turn might trigger certain signaling events in focal adhesions , possibly by mechanically opening up certain signaling domains @xcite .",
    "our speculation provides a simple way to estimate the rebinding rate , which is very hard to measure experimentally . using compliant substrates",
    ", it has been found that focal adhesions are characterized by a stress constant @xmath431 nn/@xmath432 @xcite .",
    "we do not know which of the many different proteins in focal adhesions defines the weak link which most likely ruptures under force , but we expect that it will have a similar area density as the integrin receptors , which are expected to have a typical distance between 10 and 30 nm , corresponding to @xmath53 and @xmath386 molecules per @xmath432 , respectively . to obtain a lower estimate for @xmath30 , we therefore use @xmath433 nn and @xmath434 . for activated @xmath435-integrin binding to fibronectin , recent single molecule experiments obtained for the molecular parameter values @xmath436 hz and @xmath437 pn @xcite .",
    "therefore the rebinding rate can be estimated to be at least @xmath438 , that is @xmath439 hz in dimensional units .",
    "based on future experimental input , it would be interesting to extend our model of passive decay to active processes resulting in cluster growth under force .",
    "finally we want to comment that our model might also be applied to situations in materials science which are not directly related to biomolecular receptor - ligand pairs .",
    "one example is sliding friction , which recently has been modeled as dynamic formation and rupture of bonds under force @xcite . in general",
    ", we expect that many more cohesion phenomena in materials can be successfully modeled as dynamic interplay between rupture and rebinding ."
