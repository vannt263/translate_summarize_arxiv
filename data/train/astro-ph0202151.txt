    "the x - ray transients are a class of x - ray binary systems which occasionally exhibit bright outbursts during which they can display x - ray luminosities of @xmath10 to @xmath11 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "usually , those sources stay this bright for only a few weeks to at most a few months ( see , e.g. , chen , shrader , & livio 1997 ; bradt et al .",
    "2000 ) , although some can be active for several years . after the bright outbursts , the x - ray transients slowly transit back into quiescence during which they can only be detected in x - rays at a level of @xmath12 to @xmath13 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "the regime in - between quiescence and outburst ( @xmath13 to @xmath10 erg s@xmath8 ) has not been studied extensively , partly due to the relatively short time span the sources spent in this regime but also due to the instrument limitations ( e.g. , lack of sensitivity or observational constraints ) .",
    "the neutron star sources which have been studied best in this regime are aql x-1 and the accretion - driven millisecond x - ray pulsar sax j1808.43658 .",
    "campana et al .",
    "( 1998b ) used _ bepposax _ data to study the decay of aql x-1 after one of its outbursts .",
    "they found a source which decreased steadily in luminosity until it reached quiescent levels .",
    "its spectrum hardened during the decay , although a soft component below a few kev became more prominent .",
    "however , unlike most x - ray transients , aql x-1 also can exhibit long periods of activity at a low level , which either occurs after a bright outbursts or as a stand - alone event ( bradt et al .",
    "2000 ; @xmath14imon 2002 ) .",
    "such long episodes of low - level accretion have been observed for only a few other systems , such as the black - hole system 4u 163047 ( kuulkers et al .",
    "1997 ) or the neutron star systems 4u 160852 ( bradt et al . 2000 ; wachter et al . 2002 ) and sax j1808.43658 .",
    "this latter source was studied intensively by wijnands et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using data obtained with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) during the 2000 outburst of this source .",
    "they found a source which was active at a low level ( below a few times @xmath9 erg s@xmath8 ) for several months . during this period ,",
    "the source exhibited violent variability on different time scales . within only a few days , the source decreased from a luminosity of a few times @xmath9 erg s@xmath8  to @xmath15 erg s@xmath8  ( wijnands et al .",
    "2002 ; wijnands 2002 ) , but a few days later it had increased again to @xmath9 erg s@xmath8 . on several occasions ,",
    "the source also exhibited strong flaring behavior with a repetition frequency of @xmath16 hz ( van der klis et al .",
    "2000 ; wijnands et al .",
    "the physical mechanisms producing these violent fluctuations are not understood . presently , it is not known if other transients can display similar behavior at such low luminosities , or if sax j1808.43658 is unique in this sense ( e.g. , due to its likely higher magnetic field strength compared to the other transients ) .",
    "recently , a group of neutron star x - ray transients has been recognized ( e.g. , heise et al .",
    "1999 ; in t zand 2001 ) , which have a rather low peak luminosity ( a few times @xmath10 erg s@xmath8 ) compared to the bright transient sources ( which have peak luminosities above @xmath17 erg s@xmath8 ) and relatively short duration ( e - folding time of less than a week ) . observations of such dim transients are still sparse and it is still unclear if they form a separate sub - class of transients ( see the discussion in in t zand 2001 ) .",
    "king ( 2000 ) argued that they are different from the bright systems and that they are neutron star x - ray binaries which have evolved beyond their minimum orbital periods of @xmath18 minutes and have extremely low - mass companion stars .",
    "the above - mentioned millisecond x - ray pulsar is one of these dim x - ray transients and is the best studied example of this possible sub - class of transients .",
    "cumming , zweibel , & bildsten ( 2001 ) suggested that the low inferred time averaged mass accretion rate for sax j1808.43658 might be related to this source being a millisecond x - ray pulsar .",
    "for those systems which have high time averaged accretion rates , the accreted matter will screen the magnetic field , inhibiting the x - ray pulsation mechanism in those systems .",
    "this suggests that the other dim neutron star x - ray transients , which presumably have similar low time averaged accretion rate , might also exhibit millisecond x - ray pulsations ( e.g. , cumming et al . 2001 ) .    besides those faint x - ray transients , another ,",
    "different group of neutron - star x - ray binaries also have been identified which members were only seen during type - i x - ray bursts and with an accretion luminosity typically below @xmath10 erg s@xmath8 , which was undetectable by the instruments used .",
    "cocchi et al . (",
    "2001 ) discussed the possibility that those systems are a separate subclass of neutron star systems which have persistent luminosities of order @xmath19 erg s@xmath8  ( called the low - persistent bursters ) .",
    "this idea was supported by the detection of the possible group members 1rxs j171824.2402934 ( kaptein et al .",
    "2000 ) and sax j1828.51037 ( cornelisse et al .",

    "cornelisse et al .",
    "( 2002a ) elaborated on the possibility of this extra sub - class of x - ray bursters and found that their spatial distribution is consistent with the general x - ray burster distribution , but different from that of the above mentioned faint x - ray transients .",
    "this suggests that the faint x - ray transients are a different source population than the low - persistent bursters and the bright neutron star x - ray transients .",
    "however , _",
    "follow - up observations of several potential group members showed that those sources could only be seen at a luminosity below a few times @xmath21 erg s@xmath8  ( cornelisse et al .",
    "2002b ) , which are similar to the quiescent luminosities observed for the bright neutron star x - ray transients .",
    "this suggests that those low - luminosity persistent sources might be genuine transients but have sub - luminous ( @xmath19 erg s@xmath8 ) outbursts episodes , possible with a durations of years ( see the discussion in cornelisse et al .",
    "clearly , the behavior of x - ray binaries at luminosities below @xmath10 erg s@xmath8   is rather complex and our knowledge of the basic observational properties is very limited .    in 1998",

    "1998 ) is it clear that the compact object in this system is a neutron star because such events are thought to be due to thermonuclear flashes on the surface of such a star .",

    "the time of our _ chandra _ observations is indicated in the figure by the arrow . at the time of these observations",

    "this strongly suggest that the activity detected by the asm in - between the two outbursts is unrelated to sax j1747.02583 and probably it is due to the uncertainties in the fitting process ( levine et al . 1996 ) and the proximity of sax j1747.02853 near the galactic center .",
    "this is consistent with the low fluxes detected for this source during the galactic bulge scan program ( markwardt et al .",
    "2000b ) of _ rxte _ as judged from the light curve of sax j1747.02853 , which is presented by in t zand ( 2001 ) in his figure 4 .",
    "assuming a power - law spectrum with index of 2 and a column density of @xmath36 cm@xmath8 , 1 asm count corresponds to an unabsorbed 0.510 kev flux of @xmath38 erg @xmath30 s@xmath8 .",
    "the peak count rate of @xmath39 and @xmath40 counts s@xmath8 during the 2000 and 2001 outburst would results in a flux of @xmath41 and @xmath42 erg @xmath30 s@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "these fluxes are obtained using 5 day averaged count rates and the asm dwell data indicates that at certain times the fluxes could be a factor of 2 higher .",
    "furthermore , extra uncertainties are introduced by our assumption of a power - law spectrum for the source , but usually neutron star x - ray transients become softer when they increase in luminosities . despite these uncertainties , these fluxes are clearly considerably larger ( up to two orders of magnitude ) than the fluxes we observed during our _ chandra _ observations .",
    "we have detected a bright x - ray source in the various error circles of sax j1747.02853 and in that of gx + 0.2,0.2 , making it likely that our source can be identified with those transients .",
    "the source had a 0.510 kev unabsorbed x - ray flux of @xmath43 erg @xmath30 s@xmath8 , which for a distance of 9 kpc ( natalucci et al .",
    "2000 ) results in a 0.510 kev luminosity of @xmath44 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "this luminosity is about two orders of magnitude lower than the maximum luminosity observed during the peak of the 2000 and 2001 outbursts ( as observed with the _ rxte_/asm ) .",
    "these high outburst luminosities are different from the low ( a few times @xmath10 erg s@xmath8 ; 210 kev ) luminosity observed for this source during its 1998 outburst ( sidoli et al .",
    "1998 ; natalucci et al .",
    "sax j1747.02853 is in this respect similar to several other systems , such as for example the neutron star system aql x-1 or the black - hole systems xte j1550564 and xte j1859 + 226 .",
    "aql x-1 usually exhibits bright outbursts , but occasionally it exhibits outburst which are one order of magnitude less bright ( e.g. , bradt et al . 2000 ; @xmath14imon 2002 ) .",
    "xte j1550564 exhibited a bright outburst in 1998/1999 ( see , e.g. , sobczak et al . 2000 ) but after that three much weaker outbursts have been observed ( smith et al . 2000 ; tomsick et al .",
    "2001a ; swank , smith , & markwardt 2002 ) .",

    "however , the later outbursts ( especially that in 2000 ) demonstrate that this source can also exhibit bright outbursts with peak luminosities considerably higher than @xmath17 erg s@xmath8 . in t zand ( 2001 ) showed that during the 2000 outburst , the source was active for at least 200 days .",
    "our _ chandra _ observations of the source were performed @xmath6500 days after the start of the 2000 outburst and @xmath6 50 days before the 2001 re - flare , suggesting that in - between those outburst episodes the source might have been active at similar levels as detected during our _ chandra _ observations ( a few times @xmath9 erg s@xmath8 ) .",
    "if indeed true , then the source was active for almost 600 days and possibly even longer ( no information is present about the current state of this source ) .",
    "the bright 2000 and 2001 outbursts combined with the possible extended period of accretion are in contrast with the basic properties of the faint x - ray transient group ( weak and short outbursts ) making the classification of sax j1747.02853 as a faint x - ray transient no longer justified ( unless the classification criteria are relaxed ) .",
    "a similar conclusion can be reached for the neutron star transient in the globular cluster ngc 6440 .",
    "this source exhibited a faint outburst in 1998 august ( in t zand et al .",
    "1999 ) , but it erupted again in 2001 august as a bright transient with a peak flux in excess of a few times @xmath17 erg s@xmath8   and an outburst duration in excess of 3 months ( in t zand et a. 2001 ) .",
    "this behavior is remarkably similar to sax j1747.02853 in that a weak , short outburst was also followed by brighter and much longer outbursts .",
    "those similarities between the two systems raises the question if some ( maybe all ) of the other systems classified as faint transients , can also exhibit bright outbursts , which would cast doubts on whether those systems are indeed fundamentally different from the bright x - ray transients .",
    "such a fundamental difference was suggested by king ( 2000 ) who argued that those faint transients are binary neutron star systems which have evolved below the period minimum , have low time - averaged mass accretion rates ( @xmath46 m@xmath47  year@xmath8 ) , have recurrence times of only a few years , and have very low - mass companion stars .",
    "the large mass accretion rates inferred for sax j1747.02853 and the transient in ngc 6440 ( in t zand et al .",

    "it also makes it less unlikely that they will exhibit millisecond x - ray pulsations because their relatively high inferred accretion rates will bury the magnetic field of the neutron star ( cumming et al . 2001 ) .",

    "even if true , the sources still can not be classified as faint transients ( because their outbursts can be very bright and extended ) .",
    "it remains to be determined if a sub - group of faint x - ray transients exists and if they are indeed post - minimum binaries .",
    "we detected sax j1747.02853 about 2 months before the 2001 outburst peaked ( which was around 17 september 2001 ) , demonstrating that the source was actively accreting well before the full outburst happened .",

    "the possibility exists that the physical mechanism behind this extended period of low - level activity in sax j1747.02853 is related to the mechanism behind the low - level activity in the low persistent x - ray bursters .",
    "if true , it can not be excluded that also those latter source group might exhibit outbursts ( either dim or bright ) in the future , similar to what has been observed for sax j1747.02853 .",
    "currently , it is unclear if different sub - classes of neutron - star x - ray binaries are really needed to explain the observed differences , or that the underlining mechanisms are related to each other .",
    "the traditional disk instability model to explain outburst light curves of x - ray transients ( see lasota 2001 for an overview ) has not yet addressed the issue of the behavior of x - ray transients in this low - luminosity region .",
    "the modeling of the behavior of neutron star x - ray binaries in this regime might be complex because of the increasing influence ( see campana et al .",
    "1998a for a discussion ) of the magnetic field of the neutron star ( if not buried completely by the accreted matter ) .",
    "the lack of our knowledge is partly due to the lack of sensitive observations in this regime .",
    "however with current instruments , we can now obtain high quality spectra of x - ray transients when they are decaying into quiescence .",
    "sax j1747.02853 was not the target of the _ chandra _ observations reported here , and therefore they were not optimized for the study of this object at the detected brightness level .",
    "this resulted in relatively large uncertainties in our spectral parameters which do not allow to make strong conclusions .",
    "the spectral fit results are consistent with a constant spectral shape of the source between our observations and that of the _",
    "bepposax_/nfi observations reported by natalucci et al .",
    "( 2000 ) when the source luminosity was approximately one order of magnitude larger .",
    "no conclusive spectral softening or hardening was observed , although we can not exclude such spectral changes either .",
    "the sub - arcsecond _ chandra _ position of sax j1747.02853 allows for follow up studies at other wavelengths at times when the source is found to be active .",
    "although the high column density of the source will strongly inhibit detection of the source at optical wavelengths , it might be possible to detect the source at ( near-)infrared wavelengths . to this order",
    "we have presented @xmath24 and @xmath50 finding charts of sax j1747.02853 in figure  [ fig : finding ] .",
    "the excellent position of the source might also be useful for follow up x - ray observations with _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ when the source is in quiescence .",
    "quiescent neutron star systems have luminosities in the range of @xmath21 to @xmath51 erg s@xmath8 , resulting in a flux range of @xmath52 to @xmath53 erg @xmath30 s@xmath8 . if the quiescent flux of sax j1747.02853 is dominated by the same thermal component observed in other quiescent neutron star systems ( with blackbody temperature of 0.20.3 kev ; e.g. , bildsten & rutledge 2002 and references therein ) , then it is unlikely ( due to the large column density ) that the source will be detectable within a reasonable amount of time ( less than a few tens of kiloseconds ) with either _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton_. however , if besides the thermal component , also a power - law component above 2 kev is present ( as observed for several quiescent systems ; e.g. , asai et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ; campana et al .",
    "1998b ) and it contributes to about half the total flux , than with a few tens of kiloseconds the source might be detectable ( similarly to the recent detection of quiescent emission from the neutron star x - ray transient gro j174428 , which has a comparable column density ; wijnands & wang 2002 ) . due to the sub - arcsecond",
    "chandra _ position , the quiescent counterpart of sax j1747.02853 can be easily identified . for other transients near the galactic center region ,",
    "the positions are usually known only to an accuracy of 1 arcminutes or worse , which increases significantly the probability that if any sources are detected in the error circles of those transients , that they are background agns or unrelated galactic sources which also emit hard x - rays .",
