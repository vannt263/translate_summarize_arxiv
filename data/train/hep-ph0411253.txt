    "exclusive processes mediated by the weak force are an area of investigation which may gather a wide interest in the forthcoming years due to the various experimental proposals to detect neutrino oscillations at intermediate energy using neutrino factories and superbeams @xcite .",
    "these proposals require a study of the neutrino - nucleon interaction over a wide range of energy starting from the elastic / quasi - elastic domain up to the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) region ( see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite for an overall overview )",
    ". however , the discussion of the neutrino nucleon interaction has , so far , been confined either to the dis region or to the form factor / nucleon resonance region , while the intermediate energy region , at this time , remains unexplored also theoretically . clearly , to achieve a `` continuos '' description of the underlying strong interaction dynamics , from the resonant to the perturbative regime ,",
    "will require considerable effort , since it is experimentally and theoretically difficult to disentangle a perturbative from a non - perturbative dynamics at intermediate energy , which appear to be superimposed .",
    "this is best exemplified - at least in the case of electromagnetic processes , such as compton scattering - in the dependence of the intermediate energy description on the momentum transfer @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the interaction of neutrinos with the constituents of the nucleon is no different , once the partonic structure of the target is resolved . from our viewpoint ,",
    "the presence of such a gap in our knowledge well justifies any attempt to improve the current situation .    together with amore ,",
    "we have pointed out @xcite that exclusive processes of dvcs - type ( deeply virtual compton scattering ) could be relevant also in the theoretical study of the exclusive neutrino / nucleon interaction .",
    "thanks to the presence of an on - shell photon emitted in the final state , this particle could be tagged together with the recoiling nucleon in a large underground detector in order to trigger on the process and exclude contamination from other backgrounds . with these motivations ,",
    "a study of the @xmath1 process has been performed in @xcite .",
    "the process is mediated by a neutral current and is particularly clean since there is no bethe - heitler contribution .",
    "it has been termed _ deeply virtual neutrino scattering _ or dvns and requires in its partonic description the electroweak analogue of the `` non - forward parton distributions '' , previously introduced in the study of dvcs .    in this work",
    "we extend that analysis and provide , in part , a generalization of those results to the charged current case .",
    "our treatment , here , is purposely short .",
    "the method that we use for the study of the charged processes is based on the formalism of the non - local operator product expansion and the technique of the harmonic polynomials , which allows to classify the various contributions to the interaction in terms of operators of a definite geometrical twist @xcite .",
    "we present here a classification of the leading twist amplitudes of the charged process while a detailed phenomenological analysis useful for future experimental searches will be given elsewhere .",
    "fig .  [ dvcs_1.eps ] illustrates the process that we are going to study , where a neutrino of momentum @xmath2 scatters off a nucleon of momentum @xmath3 via a neutral or a charged current interaction ; from the final state a photon and a nucleon emerge , of momenta @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , while the momenta of the final lepton is @xmath6 .",
    "we recall that compton scattering has been investigated in the near past by several groups , since the original works @xcite .",
    "a previous study of the virtual compton process in the generalized bjorken region , of which dvcs is just a particular case , can be found in @xcite . from the hadronic side , the description of the interaction proceeds via new constructs of the parton model termed _ generalized parton distributions _ ( gpd ) or also _ non - forward parton distributions_. the kinematics for the study of gpd s is characterized by a deep virtuality of the exchanged photon in the initial interaction ( @xmath7 ) ( @xmath8 2 gev@xmath9 ) , with the final state photon kept on - shell ; large energy of the hadronic system ( @xmath10 gev@xmath9 ) above the resonance domain and small momentum transfers @xmath11 gev@xmath9 . in the electroweak case",
    ", photon emission can occur from the final state electron ( in the case of charged current interactions ) and provides an additional contribution to the virtual compton amplitude .",
    "we choose symmetric defining momenta and use as independent variables the average of the hadron and gauge bosons momenta    p_1,2= |p q_1,2= q ,    with @xmath12 being the momentum transfer . clearly        and @xmath13 is the nucleon mass .",
    "there are two scaling variables which are identified in the process , since 3 scalar products can grow large in the generalized bjorken limit : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath17 is a small parameter in the process .",
    "momentum asymmetries between the initial and the final state nucleon are measured by two scaling parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , related to ratios of the former invariants    = - & & =    where @xmath18 is a variable of bjorken type , expressed in terms of average momenta rather than nucleon and gauge bosons momenta .",
    "the standard bjorken variable @xmath20 is trivially related to @xmath18 in the @xmath21 limit and in the dvcs case @xmath22 .",
    "notice also that the parameter @xmath18 measures the ratio between the plus component of the momentum transfer and the average momentum .",
    "@xmath18 , therefore , parametrizes the large component of the momentum transfer @xmath23 , which can be generically described as    [ delta ] = -2 |p - _    where all the components of @xmath24 are @xmath25 .",
    "prior to embark on the discussion of the virtual compton contribution , we quote the result for the bethe - heitler ( bh ) subprocess , which makes its first appearance in the charged current case , since a real photon can be radiated off the leg of the final state lepton .",
    "the amplitude of the bh contribution for a @xmath26 exchange is as follows & & t_bh^w^+=-|e| ( l)u(l)^*_(q_2 ) + & & ( p_2)u(p_1 ) , + where @xmath27 is the polarization vector of the photon and & & t_bh^w^-=|e| ( l)v(l ) ^*_(q_2 ) + & & ( p_2)u(p_1 ) + for the @xmath28 case , with @xmath29 being the propagator of the w s and @xmath30 the usual nucleon form factors ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moving to the compton amplitude for charged and neutral currents , this can be expressed in terms of the correlator of currents t_=id^4x e^i qx p_2|t(j_^(x/2 ) j_^w^,z_0(-x/2))|p_1 , where for the charged and neutral currents we have the following expressions & & j^z_0(-x/2)=_u(-x/2)^(g^z_u v+g^z_u a^5)_u(-x/2)+_d(-x/2)^(g^z_d v+g^z_d a^5)_d(-x/2 ) , + & & j^w^+(-x/2)=_u(-x/2)^(1-^5)u^*_u d_d(-x/2 ) , + & & j^w^-(-x/2)=_d(-x/2)^(1-^5)u_d u_u(-x/2 ) , + & & j^ , ( x/2)=_d(x/2)^(-e)_d(x/2 ) + _ u(x/2)^(e)_u(x/2 ) .",
