    "one of the reasons to go beyond the standard model ( sm ) is to explain the observed hierarchies in fermion masses and mixing .",
    "any physics beyond the sm is expected to contain new sources of flavour violation and is therefore strongly constrained by experimental data .",
    "an interesting hypothesis , known under the name of minimal flavour violation(mfv ) , is that in the extensions of the sm , as in the sm itself , the maximal fermion flavour symmetry @xmath11 is broken only by the yukawa couplings  @xcite . under that hypothesis ,",
    "the new sources of flavour violation can be described in terms of higher dimension effective operators , symmetric under @xmath11 , with yukawa couplings included as spurion fields .",
    "the smallness of some of the yukawa couplings provides a strong suppression of the fcnc and cp violating effects and therefore mfv is consistent with a new scale as low as a few tev .",
    "however , in most explicit models aiming at explaining the yukawa coupling pattern constructed so far , the initial flavour symmetry group is much smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "one may then expect potentially more dangerous sources of the fcnc effects and , in consequence , the need for a much higher uv completion scale .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate that question in a large class of flavour models based on horizontal symmetries and to find experimental observables most sensitive to such completions .",
    "similarly as under the mfv hypothesis , once a particular flavour symmetry is assumed , one can construct all effective low - energy operators using a spurion analysis , with the symmetry breaking fields playing the role of spurions  @xcite .",
    "such an analysis has to be repeated for each chosen symmetry group .",
    "furthermore , although in principle all operators allowed by the symmetry arguments are expected to be generated by the ( unspecified ) uv completions , their coefficients do depend on the uv dynamics and therefore are not under control in such an approach .",
    "in this paper we do not take that path .",
    "instead , we point out that in a general class of flavour models one can identify certain patterns of universally present effective fcnc operators .",
    "they depend only on the rotation angles transforming the light fermion fields from the flavour basis to the mass eigenstate basis , and the minimal bounds on the scale of uv completions can be estimated for different qualitative pattern of the rotation angles .",
    "this is possible because in the flavour basis certain operators are unavoidably present as a consequence of the dynamics supposed to explain the hierarchical yukawa couplings . for instance , if some flavour diagonal effective operators with non - equal coefficients were always present , our point would be immediately obvious . as we shall see , it is easy to identify the minimal set of operators in the flavour diagonal basis and the above conclusion remains valid .",
    "thus , one can determine the minimal fcnc effects which do not depend on the details of the flavour symmetry .",
    "we investigate models based on abelian and non - abelian flavour symmetries .",
    "effective higher dimension operators such as 4-fermion operators or 2-fermion penguin operators necessarily originate from integrating out bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "here we analyse the flavour violating effects arising from an exchange of heavy scalar degrees of freedom ( possibly together with heavy fermions ) with the mass scale @xmath12 that are an integral part of many flavour models .",
    "these effects are suppressed by @xmath13 .",
    "we obtain an absolute lower bound on the scale @xmath12 of the order of 20 tev in generic abelian flavour models . in non - abelian models , on the other hand , additional suppression factors in the fcnc effects allow @xmath12 to be as low as the tev scale .",
    "there are of course also other scalar bosonic degrees of freedom whose integration out generates flavour violating higher dimensional operator .",
    "always present are the sm vector or higgs bosons .",
    "the four - fermion operators generated at tree - level are then suppressed by @xmath13 and additional powers of @xmath14 since they arise from su(2)@xmath15 breaking effects .",
    "the case in which these effects are the only new source of flavour - violation has been studied in @xcite , implying a bound on the scale of the order of roughly 1 tev . in supersymmetric models flavour violation enters low energy physics through sparticle exchange . since the suppression scale is only @xmath16 , these effects can be relevant even if the flavour sector lives at very large scales provided the susy breaking scale is even higher @xcite .",
    "finally , four - fermion operators could arise from an exchange of low - energy flavour gauge bosons as it has been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "in section 2 we shortly review the uv completion of flavour models in order to show that there must always exist heavy fields that couple to the light fermions and we study the minimal , unavoidable effective flavour violating operators which arise from the exchange of these messenger fields . in section 3",
    "we compare the obtained universal pattern of the minimal fcnc effects with the experimental bounds on flavour - violating operators and obtain constraints on the messenger scale depending on light rotation angles .",
    "we then make the additional assumption of a messenger sector compatible with su(5 ) , which allows us to include other relevant operators in the discussion leading to a variety of correlations between experimental observables .",
    "we finally conclude in section 4 .",
    "we consider models with a general flavour symmetry group @xmath17 spontaneously broken by the vevs of scalar fields @xmath18 that will be called flavons in the following .",
    "the sm yukawa couplings arise from higher - dimensional @xmath17 invariant operators involving the flavons @xcite : @xmath19 where the suppression scale @xmath20 is the typical scale of the flavour sector dynamics .",
    "the coefficients of the effective operators are assumed to be @xmath21 , so that the hierarchy in the yukawa matrices arise exclusively from the small order parameters @xmath22 .",
    "the transformation properties of the sm fields and the flavons under @xmath17 are properly chosen , so that @xmath23 together with their exponents @xmath24 reproduce the observed hierarchy of fermion masses of mixing .    in order to uv - complete these models one has to `` integrate in '' new heavy fields at the scale @xmath12 .",
    "these messenger fields are vectorlike and charged under @xmath17 . in order to generate the effective yukawas of eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) , the messengers must couple to sm fermions and flavons and , depending on their nature , they mix either with the sm fermions or with the sm higgs . in the first case one has to introduce vectorlike fermions with the quantum numbers of the sm fermions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - fuvc ] ) . in the second case one introduces scalar fields with the quantum numbers of the sm higgs field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - huvc ] ) . in the fundamental theory ,",
    "small fermion masses arise from a small mixing of light and heavy fermions for the first possibility , while they arise from small vevs of the heavy scalars in the second case .",
    "we refer to these two possibilities as `` fermion uv completion '' ( fuvc ) and `` higgs uv completion '' ( huvc ) , respectively .",
    "the only interactions that are relevant for our discussion are the ones that involve messenger fields and sm fermions .",
    "the rest of the lagrangian is only responsible for generating the mixing between light and heavy states and do not affect the minimal flavour effects we are going to discuss in the next section .",
    "the relevant interactions can be readily seen in figs .",
    "[ fig - fuvc ] and [ fig - huvc ] .",
    "in particular , in the case of fuvc we have couplings among ( mainly ) light and heavy fermions of the schematic form : @xmath25 while in the huvc we are only interested in interactions involving sm fermions and higgs messengers : @xmath26 since the hierarchy is supposed to arise from the flavour symmetry breaking alone , we can assume that all dimensionless couplings in the fundamental lagrangian are @xmath21 . a more detailed discussion of the structure of the messenger sector is presented in @xcite .    ]     ]      .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]    we now want to derive the effective flavour - violating operators that arise from messenger exchange independently of the details of the particular flavour model . for this",
    "we consider flavour - conserving operators , which then induce fcnc effects in the mass basis that only depend on light rotation angles .",
    "let us first assume the presence of a coupling in the messenger lagrangian of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is a ( mainly ) light fermion and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are a fermion and a scalar of which at least one is a heavy messenger , cf .",
    "( [ lfermion ] , [ lhiggs ] ) . from the box diagram with @xmath32 propagating in the loop",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag]a ) we get the effective operator @xmath33 where @xmath12 is the heaviest mass in the loop and we neglected factors of @xmath21 .",
    "we can use the same coupling also to write down a penguin diagram with a mass insertion in the external fermion line ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag]b ) .",
    "this generates the dipole operator @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the light fermion mass and we have again estimated the coefficient very roughly .",
    "the couplings @xmath36 are indeed present in the messenger sector of every flavour model .",
    "this is clear at least for @xmath37 , since the light generations have to couple to some messengers in order to obtain a full rank mass matrix .",
    "the same argument holds for @xmath38 in the down .",
    "] and charged lepton sector , but in general not in the up sector , since the top quark can get massive without coupling to the messenger sector .",
    "finally there are also certain tree - level operators which unavoidably arise in higgs uv completions .",
    "consider for example the couplings of the heavy neutral higgs fields to the down quarks @xmath39 in order to get a full rank down mass matrix , at least one of the four couplings @xmath40 has to be non - zero . by integrating out @xmath41 at tree - level ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag]c ) we therefore obtain at least one of the four operators @xmath42 again the same reasoning goes through in the up 1 - 2 sector , and in every charged lepton and down sector ( e.g. at least one of the four operators in eq .",
    "( [ 4ops ] ) must exist also for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , but in most generality not in sectors involving the top quark .    in principle",
    "there are tree - level operators also in fermion uv completions arising from flavon exchange . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ yuk ] ) , these operators are suppressed by @xmath45 , where @xmath35 are the light fermion masses , @xmath46 is the flavon mass and @xmath47 its vev . for flavon mass and vev not far from the messenger",
    "scale this contribution scales with the fourth power of the inverse messenger scale and gives only very mild bounds on the messenger scale @xcite .",
    "we therefore neglect these contributions in the following .",
    "having collected the unavoidable flavour - conserving operators in eqns .",
    "( [ deltas2])([4ops ] ) , we now go to the mass basis using approximate transformations of this kind : @xmath48 in order to obtain flavour - violating operators . in specific models",
    "there are in general other contributions to such operators that could be even larger . however , the contribution discussed above does not depend on the details of the flavour symmetry and its breaking pattern and therefore allows to estimate minimal predictions for the operator coefficients .",
    "notice that in abelian models there is no reason for cancellations among different contributions to a given fcnc effective operator generated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rot ] ) , since the operators in eqns .",
    "( [ deltas2])([4ops ] ) arise from integrating out flavour messengers that by construction have different @xmath21 couplings to light fermions , i.e.  the breaking of flavour universality is o(1 ) . in non - abelian flavour models",
    "those couplings are universal ( controlled by the symmetry ) and the breaking of flavour universality is suppressed by small order parameters .",
    "this is because in those models the operator of eq .",
    "( [ deltas2 ] ) in the flavour basis is given by ( restricting to the 1 - 2 sector ) @xmath49 which clearly remains in this form after rotating to the mass basis .",
    "flavor transitions are only generated upon including a universality breaking term @xmath50 each flavor transition in the operator in the mass basis is then suppressed by @xmath51 that depends on the flavon vevs that are responsible for universality breaking . therefore in non - abelian models there is an additional suppression of the above effect that depends on the particular flavour transition . in principle",
    "this suppression can be as large as in mfv , but in models with a single non - abelian factor , like in most explicit models constructed so far , the additional suppression factor is rather mild compared to mfv . to estimate this factor we consider the case of a su(3)@xmath52 model @xcite with all quarks transforming as a @xmath53 and flavons as @xmath54 .",
    "the flavons get hierarchical vevs that induce the quark masses .",
    "the flavon vev responsible for universality breaking in the @xmath55-@xmath56 sector is therefore roughly given by the square root of the yukawa coupling @xmath57 .",
    "the situation is similar in the case of some u(2)@xmath52 flavour models @xcite , where transitions in 1 - 3 and 2 - 3 sector are always unsuppressed .",
    "taking into account the general case of two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) , one finds the following suppression factors for each flavour transitions ( two flavon insertions ) :    .[suppna]additional suppression factors of flavour transitions in simple non - abelian models . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the results for the 1 - 2 sector are shown in table [ su5sector12 ] .",
    "note that the processes @xmath58 and @xmath59 do not appear in these tables , since the new physics contribution to these processes is negligible if the constraints on the messenger scale from correlated processes are fulfilled .    in the case of fermion uvc ( table  [ su5sector12 ] , up ) the strongest bound on",
    "the scale comes from @xmath60 mixing except for small real angles , in which case @xmath61 can be more constraining than @xmath62 .",
    "the most interesting aspect is that the ratio @xmath63 is always @xmath64 , much larger than the typical susy prediction @xmath65 .",
    "again this follows from the bounds in table  [ su5sector12 ] using @xmath66 where @xmath67 and the notation is as in eq .",
    "( [ superf ] ) .",
    "the correlations in the @xmath68 sector are such that , if meg finds evidence for @xmath69 with @xmath70 , then we have using again eqns .",
    "( [ superf ] , [ superf2 ] ) @xmath71 i.e.  other lfv processes must be observed at future experiments . if , on the other hand , meg does not observe @xmath69 ( setting a bound on the scale up to @xmath72 tev ) , there is still the possibility to discover @xmath73 and @xmath74 conversion in nuclei ( since future experiments will test larger scales , up to 120 tev and 290 tev respectively ) .",
    "notice that the future sensitivity for @xmath61 , @xmath73 and @xmath75 is always beyond the bound from @xmath60 mixing , provided that the cpv phases are sufficiently suppressed .    in the case of higgs messengers ( table [ su5sector12 ] , down ) , the strongest bound",
    "is set either by @xmath60 mixing observables or @xmath76 , that can now arise at tree - level .",
    "this latter process is the most constraining ( even in the cpv case ) if at least one of the angles is very small , so that the tree - level contribution to @xmath60 vanishes .",
    "the strong bounds from the kaon sector imply that br(@xmath69 ) is always suppressed below the @xmath77 level , i.e.  far beyond the reach of meg , and @xmath73 can not be observed neither in this scenario .",
    "the only possible deviations from the sm can be then observed in the kaon system and for @xmath74 conversion in nuclei , for which can be as large as @xmath78 , provided that cp violating phases are sufficiently suppressed .",
    "let us briefly comment on the 1 - 3 and 2 - 3 sectors .",
    "besides the @xmath79 and @xmath80 mixing observables ( respectively @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) discussed in table [ bstab ] , we consider @xmath85",
    ". decays and @xmath86 give negligible bounds on the messenger scale compared to other observables .",
    "] for the fermion uvc , all processes in these sectors give a very weak constraint on the messenger scale ( below the 1 tev level ) , much below the minimal bound of 19 tev , unless the rh rotations are @xmath87 . in this case ,",
    "deviations from the sm are only possible for @xmath88 observables , since @xmath81 and @xmath82 give at present a bound on the scale of about 25 tev and the future lhcb sensitivity to @xmath84 can constrain scales up to 35 tev . the same results qualitatively hold in the case of higgs uvc , but for @xmath85 , that can now arise at tree - level .",
    "larger rates than in the sm are then possible and , in particular , the present experimental bounds for @xmath89 can be easily saturated .",
    "interestingly , the ratio br(@xmath90)/br(@xmath91 ) can be even @xmath87 , contrary to the sm ( and mfv ) prediction .",
    "let us summarise the phenomenological consequences ( valid up to @xmath21 factors ) separately for higgs and fermion uvcs .",
    "* *    * with the present experimental bounds the ratio @xmath63 is @xmath64 .",
    "* evidence for @xmath61 at meg would imply @xmath73 and @xmath68 conversion in the reach of future experiments .",
    "* deviation from the sm in 1 - 3 and 2 - 3 transitions can only occur in @xmath92 observables .    * *    * kaon sector bounds prevent observation of lfv processes except @xmath93 conversion .",
    "* @xmath94 and @xmath95 can saturate present bounds and be comparable to each other , contrary to mfv .",
    "we have discussed model - independent minimal flavour - violating effects induced by messenger sectors in models of fermion masses and mixing based on horizontal symmetries . in the flavour basis , integrating out the messengers induces higher - dimensional flavour - violating operators , whose coefficients depend on the specific flavour symmetry and breaking pattern , and flavour conserving operators . after rotating to the fermion mass basis ,",
    "the latter also contribute to the flavour - violating operators , providing a minimal contribution to flavour changing neutral currents .",
    "this contribution is model independent in the case of abelian flavour symmetries ( and to large extent for the non - abelian case too ) .",
    "the coefficients of these operators only depend on light rotation angles ( i.e.  on the structure of the yukawa matrices ) . in non - abelian models these coefficients",
    "are further suppressed by the breaking of flavour universality that is related to small flavon vevs .    for those minimal , universal contributions to the fcnc and cpv effects we have derived the bounds on the mass scale of messengers . they are valid ( up to @xmath21 coefficients ) for any abelian model and can be easily applied to a large class of non - abelian models taking into account additional suppression factors . moreover ,",
    "the abelian case is relevant for non - abelian models with some sm fermions transforming as singlets of the non - abelian flavour group .",
    "the obtained lower bounds on the messenger scale are different for different operators and in addition they depend on the chosen set of rotations .",
    "given the sensitivity expected in the forthcoming experiments , that leaves interesting room for discovering new physics and for testing fermion mass models .",
    "as the highlights of our analysis emerge the leptonic processes , @xmath96 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 conversion in nuclei .    in more detail , we find that the interplay of @xmath97 and @xmath98 mixing implies that the messenger scale in abelian models has to be larger than about 20 tev .",
    "though quite strong , this minimal bound does not prevent large effects in @xmath99 mixing and in lfv decays . in particular , the ratio @xmath100/@xmath101 can be as large as @xmath102 for large leptonic rotations , contrary to susy scenarios .",
    "more generally , the brs for both processes can be large enough to be within the reach of the future experiments . in non - abelian models",
    "the additional suppression factor on 1 - 2 flavour transitions ( at least @xmath103 ) allows messengers at the tev scale , and therefore possibly in the reach of lhc .    assuming approximately su(5)-symmetric yukawas",
    ", we can include in the analysis relevant @xmath104 operators and provide correlations between quark and lepton sector .",
    "we find that for the uv completion with heavy fermions the ratio @xmath105 is @xmath64 .",
    "an evidence for @xmath61 at meg would imply @xmath73 and @xmath68 conversion in the reach of future experiments .",
    "moreover , deviation from the sm in 1 - 3 and 2 - 3 transitions can only occur in @xmath92 observables .",
    "for the uv completion with heavy higgses , on the other hand , the bounds from the kaon sector prevent the observation of lfv processes at running / future experiments , with the possible exception of @xmath74 conversion in nuclei . also , in this case , the new contributions to @xmath106 can saturate the present experimental limits and give the two processes at comparable rates , contrary to the sm and mfv scenarios .",
