    "by analogy with results of lombardi @xcite , it has been conjectured @xcite that the above mentioned solutions of the truncated normal form homoclinic to @xmath25 do not _ generically _ persist when higher order terms are taken into account in the normal form .",
    "persistence might be true if parameters ( @xmath32 , coefficients in the taylor expansion of @xmath4 ) are chosen on a discrete collection of codimension-@xmath0 submanifolds of the parameter space .",
    "for general parameter values , instead of orbits homoclinic to @xmath25 one can expect the existence of reversible orbits homoclinic to exponentially small @xmath33dimensional tori , originating from the @xmath0 additional pairs of simple purely imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "these solutions should constitute the principal part of exact travelling breather solutions of ( [ eq : kg ] ) superposed on a small quasi - periodic oscillatory tail .",
    "however , in order to obtain exact solutions one has to prove the persistence of the corresponding homoclinic orbits as higher order terms are taken into account in the normal form .",
    "this step is non - trivial and would require to generalize results of lombardi @xcite available for a single pair of simple imaginary eigenvalues ( another promising approach is developed in the recent work @xcite ) .",
    "one might think that this nonpersistence picture contrasts with the case of the integrable ablowitz - ladik lattice @xcite , which supports an explicit family of exact travelling breather solutions in which the breather velocity can be varied continuously .",
    "however these solutions are not robust under various non - hamiltonian reversible perturbations as shown in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we numerically solve system ( [ systemp ] ) in the case @xmath26 , which constitutes the simplest situation for travelling breather solutions ( the case @xmath2 corresponding to travelling waves ) .",
    "this allows us to go beyond the analytical results obtained in @xcite , which were restricted to the small amplitude regime .",
    "our numerical observations confirm that system ( [ eq : kg])-([def ] ) ( with @xmath26 ) admits travelling breather solutions superposed on a small oscillatory tail .",
    "these solutions are either weakly or strongly localized depending on the value of @xmath1 ( @xmath29 being fixed ) .",
    "these results are obtained both for hard and soft on - site potentials .",
    "in addition we provide examples where the tail s amplitude can be made extremely small near particular values of the breather velocity , which makes the tail difficult to detect at the scale of central oscillations .",
    "note that travelling breather solutions have been previously computed in the dnls equation @xcite ( in fact gauge symmetry reduces the problem to the computation of travelling waves ) , but the possible existence of a very small oscillatory tail has not been addressed .",
    "an intuitive explaination for the existence of a tail is that travelling breathers transfer energy to resonant phonons .",
    "the energy transfer can be balanced by the superposition of a resonant phonon tail , which allows the breathers to propagate in an exact way .",
    "this remark might suggest more generally that a way to enhance breather mobility in nonlinear oscillator chains could be to excite resonant phonons with appropriate amplitudes .",
    "our numerical computations are performed as follows .",

    "we use the explicit principal parts of solutions provided by center manifold theory in the small amplitude regime @xcite , and continue them numerically by varying @xmath1 .",
    "an alternative numerical method would be to consider equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) and search for fixed points of the time-@xmath1 map @xmath41 , which correspond to solutions satisfying ( [ def ] ) .",
    "this method has been used in @xcite for @xmath2 ( case of travelling waves ) .",
    "the first step of the method consists in computing a static breather , which is then perturbed in the direction of a pinning mode in order to obtain a ( slowly moving ) approximate travelling breather .",
    "this solution serves in turn as an initial guess for the newton method , as one computes fixed points of @xmath42 .",
    "one limitation of the method is that pinning modes do not always exist ( this is the case e.g. for certain hard quartic on - site potentials ) , but the method yields very precise results at least for travelling waves @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows .",
