    "many studies of the @xmath0 model suggest that this model is able to describe a large body of the low - energy physics of real high - t@xmath15 superconductors @xcite .",
    "this is true for many normal state properties of high - t@xmath15 oxides where accurate numerical predictions of the @xmath0 model are available for the comparison with experiment . whether the phenomenon of high - t@xmath15 superconductivity itself can be explained within this model is presently not so clear",
    "there are several calculations yielding instabilities of the normal state with respect to d - wave superconductivity @xcite and also reasonably high values for the transition temperature @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these calculations , however , use often somewhat uncontrolled assumptions , making definite conclusions difficult .",
    "there is also the view @xcite that the large observed values for @xmath5 are not directly related to large mean field @xmath5 s in isolated @xmath16 planes described by the @xmath0 model . instead",
    "it is argued that pair tunneling between planes enhances strongly weak , plane - related superconducting instabilities producing in this way the phenomen of high - t@xmath15 superconductivity .    in this paper",
    "we present a new attempt to calculate @xmath5 for the @xmath0 model in a well controlled way .",
    "similar as in refs .",
    "@xcite we do not assume the validity of migdal s theorem or approximate the self - energy by the lowest skeleton graphs .",
    "instead we assume that @xmath17 can be considered as a small parameter where @xmath18 is the number of electronic degrees of freedom per site .",
    "@xmath18 consists of two spin directions times @xmath19 copies of the local electronic orbital counted by a flavor index .",
    "similar like in many slave boson calculations @xcite the flavor index is introduced in a somewhat artificial way just to make @xmath18 a large integer .",
    "the @xmath20 spin symmetry of the original model is thus enlarged to the symplectic group @xmath21 .",
    "the original constraint of having no double occupancies of sites is modified to the condition that at most @xmath19 electrons can occupy the @xmath18 states at each site .",
    "compared to refs .",
    "@xcite our treatment exhibits two novel features .",
    "first , the constraint is implemented in a different and more rigorous way yielding differences in the equation for the superconducting gap already in the leading order o(1/n ) .",
    "secondly , we have solved the linearized gap equation numerically obtaining also values for @xmath5 .",
    "our conclusions about the occurrence of superconductivity in the @xmath0 model are thus no longer based only on fermi surface averaged , static coupling strengths as in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "regarding constraints their implementation in the x - operator approach is trivial @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the constraint means that the sum over diagonal elements of x - operators at a given site has to be equal to @xmath19 .",
    "this sum commutes with every x - operator and thus is a multiple of the identity operator in any irreducible representation of x - operators . enforcing the constraint means",
    "therefore just to select the correct subspace of hilberts space where the eigenvalue of this sum is equal to @xmath19 . in slave boson theory the x - operators",
    "are represented by product of slave operators and the hilbert space is enlarged to the hilbert space of slave particles .",
    "the constraint means now that at each site the number operator of slave particles has to be equal @xmath19 .",
    "this condition can obviously not hold as an operator identity , i.e. , can not be enforced at any position of an expectation value of slave operators .",
    "however , it should be enforced at all positions which originally separated x - operators .",
    "such an enforcement for a fixed @xmath18 seems to be in conflict with the bose condensation of the bosonic slave particles as well as the independence of fermion and bosonic slaves in the limit @xmath22 . using the dirac method to enforce constraints on the operator level",
    "it has indeed been shown @xcite that the commutator relations for the slave particles have to be changed and that , for instance , the fermionc and the bosonic slave operators no longer commute with each other . in view of this open problems",
    "we use in sections ii and iii a perturbation expansion directly in x - operators following the work of ref .",
    "@xcite this procedure will give us also the opportunity to compare the o(1/n ) expression for the gap equation with that of the slave boson approach to see whether the @xmath17 expansions are really the same in the two cases .",
    "the final analytic results for the gap equation have already been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , without derivations .",
    "these derivations can be found in sections ii and iii .    the second new feature of our work deals with the solution of the gap equation .",
    "previous work using 1/n expansions concluded from fermi surface averaged , static coupling constants on the occurrence of superconductivity .",
    "our previous work @xcite has shown that superconducting instabilities occur for any symmetry channel , doping and both for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the point is more whether the corresponding @xmath5 is very small or large enough to be relevant .",
    "@xmath5 here is understood as the transition temperature within mean - field theory .",
    "this means that the lowering of @xmath5 due to fluctuations in the superconducting order parameter is not taken into account .",
    "this assumption is justified if one compares with real , three - dimensional superconductors but does not apply , of course , to strictly two - dimensional models where fluctuations drive the order parameter to zero at any finite temperature . in order to determine @xmath5 one has to solve the gap equation which has several non - bcs features : the kernel of the linearized gap equation consists of an instantaneous and a retarded term and both are characterized by different cutoffs .",
    "moreover , the presence of the instantaneous term does not allow to restrict the momenta to the fermi surface .",
    "consequently , we solved the gap equation by numerical means .",
    "our method is also suitable to investigate the question of odd frequency pairing @xcite in our model . in this case",
    "the instantaneous term drops out but the full frequency dependence of the kernel must be kept in addition to the momentum dependence along the fermi line .",
    "results for odd frequency pairing will also be presented in section iv together with the conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath0 model can be written as @xmath25 let us consider first the case @xmath26 .",
    "assuming one orbital per site and excluding double occupancies of sites there are three states @xmath27 at each atom @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 denotes the empty state , and @xmath30 singly occupied states with spin up and down .",
    "the hubbard operators @xmath31 can be represented as projection operators @xmath32 and obey the following commutator and anticommutator relations @xmath33_{\\pm } = \\delta_{ij } ( \\delta_{qr}x_i^{ps } \\pm \\delta_{sr } x_i^{rq}),\\ ] ] and the completeness relation @xmath34 the upper ( lower ) sign in eq.(2 ) holds for bosonlike or mixed ( fermionlike ) hubbard operators defined by @xmath35 or @xmath36 ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) . for @xmath39 both the upper and lower signs hold in each case .",
    "the first term in eq.(1 ) describes the hopping of particles between the sites @xmath28 and @xmath40 with matrix elements @xmath41 . the second term in eq.(1 )",
    "denotes the heisenberg interaction between the spin densities at site @xmath28 and @xmath40 with the exchange constants @xmath42 . the third term in eq.(1 ) represents the charge - charge interaction of the @xmath0 model . in the following we consider @xmath42 only between nearest neighbors ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath41 between nearest ( @xmath44 ) and next nearest ( @xmath45 ) neighbors .",
    "we also use always @xmath46 as energy unit .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq.(1 ) is a generalization from @xmath26 to an ( even ) arbitrary integer @xmath18 .",
    "the orbital index @xmath47 consists now of the spin and a flavor index , the latter enumerating @xmath19 identical orbitals at a site .",
    "the symmetry group of @xmath48 is the symplectic group @xmath21 . for @xmath49",
    "the operators @xmath50 can no longer be written as projection operators in some basis . instead ,",
    "fermionlike ( bosonlike or mixed ones ) operators are assumed to satisfy the anticommutator ( commutator ) relations of eq.(2 ) .",
    "only some of the diagonal operators can assumed to retain their projection properties , namely , @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "most other relations characteristic of projection operators such as @xmath53 are lost for @xmath49 .",
    "the completeness relation eq.(3 ) is replaced by the constraint @xmath54 by explicit construction of the hilbert space and the action of the @xmath55 on its vectors one can show @xcite that the above properties , together with @xmath48 , specify completely the problem .",
    "in particular , @xmath56 is a non - negative operator . as a result , eq.(4 )",
    "means that at most @xmath19 particles can occupy the @xmath18 available states at a site . in this way one may expect that expectation values of observables approach",
    "smoothly the physical case @xmath26 from large @xmath57 yielding a basis for @xmath17 expansions .",
    "we also would like to point out that slave boson treatments of @xmath48 have many features in common with our approach .",
    "however , the hilbert spaces are different in the two cases as well as the enforcement of the constraint eq.(4 ) . @xmath58 commutes with all hubbard operators and thus is proportional to the identiy in any irreducible representation of the x - operators .",
    "enforcement of the constraint means in our case just the selection of the correct subspace of the hilbert space where eq.(4 ) is satisfied as an operator identity .    following the baym - kadanoff procedure @xcite we define a non - equilibrium matsubara green s function of two fermionic operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 by @xmath61 @xmath62 the number @xmath63 stands for an internal pair index @xmath64 as well as a site and a ( imaginary ) time index @xmath65 .",

    "we also introduce the non - equilibirum expectation value of bosonic x - operators by @xmath71 using the hamiltonian eq.(1 ) the heisenberg equation of motion for fermionic operators becomes @xmath72 with @xmath73 @xmath74.\\ ] ] eq.(9 ) agrees with eq.(5 ) of ref . @xcite if the different sign convention for the hopping term is taken into account . using eq.(8 ) and rewriting higher - order correlation functions in terms of functional derivatives with respect to @xmath70 the equation of motion for @xmath75",
    "can be written as @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 is the unperturbed green s function @xmath80 @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 where the index @xmath83 has been split into @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 can be expressed by @xmath75 so the above system of equations for @xmath75 , the self - energy @xmath87 , and the vertex @xmath88 is closed .    for our purposes",
    "it is more convenient to use a normalized green s function @xmath89 which obeys a dyson equation with the usual @xmath10-function on its right - hand side . writing @xmath90 and requesting that z satisfies the following equation @xmath91 eqs(10)-(12 ) assume the form @xmath92",
    "@xmath93 @xmath94 from eqs.(17 ) and ( 19 ) follows , moreover , the equation for the vertex @xmath95 with @xmath96 @xmath97 in eq.(22 ) we have replaced the functional derivative of @xmath89 with respect to @xmath70 by the vertex @xmath98 using dyson s equation which also leads to a sign change .",
    "the above equations are exact and hold both in the normal and the superconducting state . in the normal state",
    "the two internal index pairs in @xmath99 must obey either @xmath100 or @xmath101 . from dyson s equation",
    "follows then that the same holds for @xmath102 whereas the possible indices in @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 obey either @xmath106 or @xmath107 . in the superconducting state",
    "there are no such restrictions ; the only general requirement is that all these indices are associated with fermionic operators .",

    "expanding eq.(23 ) up to linear terms we obtain @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are of first order in the anomalous part and the subscript @xmath18 means that the functional derivatives are to be taken in the normal state .",
    "now @xmath114 has no linear contribution due to gauge invariance and thus drops out in eq.(24 ) . calculating @xmath113 from dyson s equation eq.(17 ) in linear approximation we obtain @xmath115 where",
    "@xmath1 is given by eq.(22 ) with all quantities taken in the normal state .",
    "eq.(25 ) represents the linearized equation for a general order parameter for superconductivity . in order to have superconductivity the homogenous equation eq.(25 )",
    "must have a nonvanishing solution for @xmath111 .",
    "the highest temperature where this occurs is the transition temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the basic quantitity to be calculated is according to eq.(25 ) the kernel @xmath1 . in order to find a functional equation for @xmath1 we get from eq.(18 ) @xmath116 and from eq.(20 ) @xmath117 @xmath118 solving eq.(27 ) for @xmath119 , inserting the result into eq.(26 ) and inserting eq.(26 ) into eq.(22 ) yields an exact functional equation for @xmath1 .",
    "the equation for @xmath1 obtained in the previous section is too difficult to be solved directly . on the other hand",
    "it is exact and holds for any @xmath18 so it may serve as a starting point for approximate treatments . in the following",
    "we assume that @xmath17 may be used as a small parameter and calculate @xmath1 up to order @xmath17 .",
    "this will allow us to obtain the gap equation eq.(25 ) in leading order of the @xmath17 expansion .",
    "the @xmath18-dependence of an equilibrium quantity is determined by the number of coupling constants it contains and the number of free internal summations . in equilibrium , i.e. , without the source term @xmath70 , we have , for instance , @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 and similar expressions for @xmath123 and @xmath1 . in eqs.(28)-(30 )",

    "we need only the leading o(1 ) contributions for these quantities . from eqs.(13 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 19 ) follows that the spin vertex becomes then simply equal to @xmath127 . using the constraint eq.(4 )",

    ", we assume always @xmath132 .",
    "with respect to spin indices we consider either singlet or triplet pairing .",
    "both cases are included if we put @xmath133 .",
    "correspondingly we will write for the internal indices @xmath134 thus indicating the special relationship between these two indices .",
    "exposing explicitly the internal indices the gap equation eq.(25 ) becomes @xmath135 where @xmath1 is to be taken in the normal state .",
    "eq.(31 ) also makes visible which indices for @xmath1 are actually needed in the gap equation .",
    "a closer examination shows that the first two contributions on the right - hand side of eq.(27 ) are of higher orders in @xmath17 than the third term in this equation for the needed combination of indices .. dropping these terms and inserting eqs.(26 ) and ( 27 ) into eq.(22 ) yields the following equation for @xmath1 valid up to o(1/n ) and for the above combinations of internal indices :    @xmath136 @xmath137 the first term on the right - hand side of eq.(32 ) could have been also obtained directly from eq.(18 ) . considering only anomalous contributions to @xmath109 the first term on the right - hand side of eq.(18 ) can not contribute , wheras the second one can contribute in two ways : a ) via an anomalous @xmath89 and a normal vertex @xmath98 , b ) via a normal @xmath89 and an anomalous vertex @xmath98 .",

    "linearizing @xmath89 in @xmath111 case a ) immediately yields the first term on the right - hand side of eq.(32 ) .",
    "its evaluation is straightforward and shows that it is of o(1/n ) for the relevant combination of internal indices .",
    "this indicates that @xmath138 for @xmath139 which agrees with the fact that at @xmath140 the system consists of renormalized , but non - interacting fermions .",

    "an examination of the various terms shows that terms with a second functional derivative of @xmath1 are smaller by a factor @xmath17 compared to the leading ones and thus can be neglected .",
    "one then finds that the functions @xmath145 have the form @xmath146 @xmath147 the reduced functions @xmath148 ( the use of the same name for corresponding functions with different number of arguments should not cause any confusion ) satisfy the integral equation @xmath149 with @xmath150 @xmath151 here @xmath152 denotes the external part of @xmath153,i.e .",
    ", the first three factors outside of the bracket in eq.(9 ) .",
    "inserting the explicit expression for @xmath7 into eq.(37 ) one finds that eq.(37 ) represents an integral equation for @xmath145 with a kernel consisting of not more than 6 separable contributions .",
    "the solution of eq.(37 ) thus reduces to the inversion of at most 6x6 matrices similar as in the case of the charge vertex @xmath125 dicussed in ref .",

    "thus d - wave pairing is stable in any case for @xmath219 . for @xmath220 @xmath221 is much larger than 1 so that the third term in eq.(58 ) cancels the second term to a large extent making extended s - wave pairing also in this region unfavourable .",
    "thus we find that the instantaneous contribution to the kernel strongly favours d - wave pairing in the interesting parameter regime .",
    "the reason for this is to a large extent a band structure effect : @xmath217 is much larger than @xmath216 at small dopings because of large contributions around the x - point . at larger doping the competing extended s - wave pairing",

    "such an contribution clearly corresponds to the case a ) discussed after eq.(32 ) , i.e. , to the first term on the right - hand side of eq.(32 ) , or , equivalently . to the sum of @xmath199 and @xmath222 .",

    "the slave boson result for @xmath199 differs , however , from eq.(43 ) : the argument in one of the two hopping terms is replaced by @xmath160 and there is an additional term proportional to @xmath226 .",

    "the superconducting order parameter of slave boson theory , on the other hand , consists of the expectation values @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "clearly , these expectation values have no analogues in the x - operator approach .      in the weak - coupling case it is often assumed that the solution of the gap equation eq.(40 ) is of bcs - type for each symmetry @xmath193",

    "the overall result is a rather modest attraction between @xmath270 and @xmath274 .",

    "it is , however , too simple to argue that @xmath217 in that formula is rather independent on @xmath13 and @xmath281 for @xmath282 .",
    "the rather perfect linear behavior is the result of more subtle dependencies such as the @xmath13-dependence of the one - particle energies and the non - rigidity of the bands as a function of @xmath13 .",

    "we have also searched for superconducting instabilities with order parameters which are odd in frequency .",

    "10 we have plotted this determinant as function of the temperature for each of the five irreducible representations using @xmath12 , @xmath295 , and @xmath296 .",

    "the nonapplicability of wick s theorem to x - operators does not cause any problem in such an approach .",
    "one also should note that the more involved and sophisticated parts of sections ii and iii deal with contributions which are far beyond those considered in previous treatments .",
    "for instance , the slave boson 1/n result @xcite for the anomalous self - energy corresponds in our approach just to the inhomogenous term in the integral equation eq.(32 ) .",
    "similarly , only part of the first contribution to the kernel , @xmath199 , was calculated in ref .",

    "taking also the numerical results of section 3 into account our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    \\a ) our explicit expression for the o(1/n ) anomalous self - energy is clearly different from the corresponding expression of the slave boson theory .",
    "in particular , the largest contribution to the retarded kernel comes in the present approach from the anomalous part of the vertex and has no analogue in the slave boson approach .",
    "the presented expressions show for the first time in an explicit way that the 1/n expansions are really different in the two approaches .",
    "this difference can be traced back to different hilbert spaces and different enforcement of the constraint .",
    "even the order parameters for superconductivity are not related in a simple way : the leading slave boson order parameter involves necessarily ( small ) violations of local constraints in order to be nonzero whereas such violations are ruled out in our approach .",

    "we found that there are superconducting instabilities in each symmetry channel and for all dopings .",
    "the true ground state thus never describes a fermi liquid but a superconductor similar as in the weak coupling case @xcite .",
    "however , these instabilities are in general extremely weak leading to academically low transition temperatures .",
    "the only clear and robust exception is the d - wavelike @xmath4 symmetry where a strong instability towards superconductivity occurs .",

    "the retarded term is of less importance because attractive and repulsive parts of it cancel each other to a large extent .",
