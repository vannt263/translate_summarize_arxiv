    "photometric and spectroscopic studies over the last 15 years have revolutionized our understanding of globular clusters ( gcs ) . once thought to be `` simple stellar populations '' with a single age and composition",
    ", essentially all gcs host multiple stellar populations ( msps ) , as revealed by their multiple photometric sequences . the exquisite precision and stability of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) has made much of this possible ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "msps can be traced to different compositions in terms of light elements ( such as na , o , al , mg observed spectroscopically ; see and references therein ) and he ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these observational findings have cast a number of challenges for the study of the formation and evolution of gcs .    in order to make progress toward a complete picture of the formation and evolutionary history of gcs , as well as to constrain the possible paths for the theoretical study of these complex challenges and questions ,",
    "a major effort to combine observational data is essential .",
    "spectroscopic and photometric studies have begun to shed light on the chemical properties , number of distinct sequences and range of ages of different stellar populations .",
    "structural and kinematic properties of different stellar populations are two additional key pieces of the puzzle , as they contain essential information to build a complete picture of msp cluster formation and dynamical evolution . according to a number of different formation scenarios ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , second - generation ( 2 g ) populations should form more concentrated in the cluster inner regions numerical simulations @xcite have shown that several clusters should still retain some memory of this initial spatial segregation and a few observational studies have indeed found clusters in which 2 g stars are still concentrated in the cluster inner regions .    little is however known to - date on the proper - motion ( pm ) based kinematics of msps ( with the only exceptions of @xmath2  cen and 47  tuc :  ) .",
    "richer et al . ( 2013 ) probed the outer regions of 47 tuc ( at @xmath01.9@xmath3 ) and found that 2 g stars are characterized by a radially anisotropic velocity distribution while the 1 g population is isotropic . as discussed in section  [ sec : theo ] , this trend is consistent with the expected kinematical implications of the formation models mentioned above ; the study presented in this letter is aimed at exploring whether the kinematics of msps in ngc  2808 further confirms this general expectation and the trend identified in 47 tuc .",
    "ngc  2808 is one of the most massive galactic gcs and one of the most massive galactic gcs and one of the few known to host a super - he - rich subpopulation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the initial picture of three distinct stellar populations found by @xcite has been recently shown to be even more complex by @xcite , who identified five distinct populations ( named a , b , c , d and e ) along the red - giant branch ( rgb ) and the main sequence ( ms ) of ngc  2808 .",
    "we point out here that populations d and e correspond to the 2 g populations identified by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their mms and bms ) .",
    "populations a , b , and c correspond to the rms of the @xcite study ( that they assumed to be the first generation , 1 g ) .",
    "new wfc3/uvis uv data ( go-12605 , pi : piotto ) allowed us to further split the rms into the three populations a , b and c. available spectroscopic data discussed in @xcite suggest that population b has na and o abundances usually associated with 1 g stars ; population c includes stars with slightly enhanced na and slightly depleted o abundances , and is photometrically distinct from population b along the rgb ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "no spectroscopic data are available to further characterize population a.    in this letter we shed further light on the properties of this complex cluster and present an analysis of the internal pms of its five stellar populations .",
    "the outline of this letter is as follows :  in section  [ sec : dataset ] we describe the data sets and reduction ; in section  [ sec : obs ] we present our results on the kinematic properties of the five populations identified in ngc  2808 . in section  [ sec : theo ] we discuss the interpretation of the observational findings .",

    "we additionally included wfc3/uvis observations of go-12605 ( @xmath12s in f336w and @xmath13s in f438w ) , taken in 2013 , to further extend the available time baseline and increase the pm accuracy .",

    "to avoid edge effects , we consider hereafter only stars within @xmath23 ( harris 1996 , 2010 edition ) . due to small - number statistics , the kinematics of the msps on the rgb can not be studied with sufficient detail . on the other hand , we have plenty of ms stars at our disposal , in particular :  598 population - a stars , 3071 b , 1875 c , 4485 d , and 1814 e. we will use the same nomenclature and color - coding of @xcite .    the 1d average transverse velocity - dispersion profile @xmath8 of each population , obtained by combining together @xmath24 and @xmath25 , is shown in panel ( a ) of fig .  [ f1 ] .",
    "we binned each population in such a way as to have the same number of measurements ( @xmath26 ) in each bin .",
    "we marked the position of @xmath3 ( inner dashed line ) , @xmath6 ( dotted line ) , and @xmath27 ( outer dashed line ) .",
    "all errorbars refer to 1-@xmath1 errors .",
    "the five profiles largely follow the same trend . to better examine small velocity - dispersion differences among them we proceeded as follows .",
    "we chose population b ( he - normal , 1 g stars ) as a reference , and we least - squares fitted a 3rd - order polynomial to its @xmath8 profile ( red points in panel a ) to obtain the average trend @xmath28 .",
    "then , we computed the differences @xmath29 between the @xmath8 of the other 4 populations ( @xmath30 ) and the average trend of population b at the same radial distance .",
    "these quantities are then normalized to the average trend of population b itself .",
    "these normalized differences are shown in panels ( b ) to ( e ) , as a function of @xmath4 , for populations a , c , d and e , respectively .",

    "the respective values of @xmath33 for these radial bins are shown as black points with errorbars .",
    "populations a and c ( panels b and c ) exhibit a slightly increasing @xmath34 values the larger the radial distance , while populations d and e ( panels d and e ) seem to have an opposite behavior",
    ". these differences are marginally significant ( at the 2-@xmath1 level ) .",
    "we repeated the same analysis shown in fig .",

    "the _ radial _ velocity dispersions of the 5 populations do not show significant differences ( with only possible hints , at less than @xmath02-@xmath1 level , of a larger @xmath38 of population a in the innermost region , a larger @xmath38 for population c in the outermost bin ) , while for @xmath39 the _ tangential _ velocity dispersion of populations d and e ( panels d and e of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) is significantly smaller ( @xmath40 for d , and @xmath41 for e , i.e. , at the 2.8- and 3.1-@xmath1 level , respectively ) than that of the reference population b. no significant difference is instead found between the kinematics of population b and that of a and c , with only a hint ( at less than @xmath02-@xmath1 level ) of a larger tangential velocity for populations a and c in the outermost regions ( panels b and c of fig  [ f3 ] )    ) .",
    "vertical lines mark the locations of @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath27.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    to further explore these findings , we computed the radial dependence of the deviation from isotropy ( @xmath42 ) of each population .",

    "the horizontal line at 0 corresponds to an isotropic system . as for fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , larger black dots refer to data binned in the 3 radial intervals , while colored points are used for data binned by keeping the same number of stars per bin .",
    "populations b and c have an overall similar trend , and tend to very slightly deviate from isotropy outside @xmath3 . in the outermost regions probed ( between @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ) populations d and e are radially anisotropic ( @xmath45 equal to @xmath46 for d and @xmath47 for e :  a deviation from an isotropic distribution at the @xmath0 3.4-@xmath1 and 3.5-@xmath1 level , respectively ) .",
    "there is a hint of population a having an opposite behavior with respect to the others :  the outer 2 points are fairly consistent with an isotropic system , while the innermost point indicates a marginally - significant ( at the @xmath02-@xmath1 level ) radial anisotropy for @xmath48 .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the nature of population a is still unclear and spectroscopic data will be necessary to characterize this population in the context of the msps of ngc  2808 .",
    "additional kinematic data would also be necessary to shed further light on the kinematic properties of this population and clarify the significance of possible kinematic anomalies .",
    "the two most statistically - significant results presented in the previous sections are :  i ) populations d and e have a radially anisotropic velocity distribution ( fig .  [ f4 ] ) in the outermost regions , and ii ) this difference in anisotropy is due to the fact that populations d and e have a smaller tangential velocity dispersion than that of the other populations ( fig .  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "no strong differences are instead found in the radial velocity dispersion of all the populations ( see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) .",
    "one of the predictions of msp cluster - formation models , in which asymptotic - giant branch ( agb ) stars are the source of gas out of which 2 g stars form , is that the agb ejecta would collect in the cluster central regions and 2 g stars would initially be more spatially concentrated than the 1 g population @xcite . other formation models , based on rapidly - rotating massive stars and/or massive binaries ( see e.g. ) do not follow the evolution of the processed gas but assume that massive stars are initially concentrated in the cluster inner regions and so is the gas they release . in any case , the subsequent long - term dynamical evolution will gradually erase the differences in the spatial distribution of 1 g and 2 g stars .",
    "measured for particles between 1.5 and 2 @xmath3 for the 2 g ( blue line ) and the 1 g ( red line ) populations ( where @xmath3 is the projected half - mass radius ) .",
    "the green line in the inset shows the time evolution of the mean of the ratio of the 2 g to the 1 g tangential velocity dispersion , while the black line is for the mean of the ratio of the 2 g to the 1 g radial velocity dispersion ( both measured between 1.5 and 2 @xmath3 ) .",
    "time is normalized to the initial half - mass relaxation time ( calculated using the projected half - mass radius).,title=\"fig : \" ] +    here , we present the results of a n - body simulation carried out to explore the evolution of the kinematical properties of different stellar populations .",
    "we started our simulation with 50@xmath18000 equal - mass particles , with 1 g and 2 g populations having the same total mass and both following a @xcite model density profile with central dimensionless potential @xmath49 .",
    "we assumed that the 2 g population is more centrally concentrated , with an initial half - mass radius about 4.5 times smaller than that of the 1 g population .",
    "as for the kinematical properties , both 1 g and 2 g systems are initially isotropic .",
    "the cluster is initially tidally limited and is assumed to move on a circular orbit in the external potential of the host galaxy ( modeled as a point mass ) .",
    "we point out that we are not ruling out the possibility that the formation process and the subsequent virialization phase might result in 1 g and 2 g subsystems with initially different anisotropy profiles , but here we focus solely on the role of relaxation - driven long - term dynamical evolution in establishing kinematical differences between different stellar populations .",
    "this simulation has been run with the gpu - accelerated version of the nbody6 code @xcite on the big red ii supercomputer at indiana university .",
    "observational data reveal that the strongest deviation from isotropy occurs in the outermost regions for which data are available . figure  [ f5 ] shows the time evolution of @xmath50 measured for particles between 1.5 and 2 @xmath3 ( where @xmath51 is the projected half - mass radius ) for the 2 g and the 1 g populations , where @xmath38 and @xmath52 are , respectively , the projected radial and tangential velocity dispersions as measured on a plane coinciding with the cluster orbital plane .",
    "this is the outermost region probed by our observational data where the difference in anisotropy between 1 g and 2 g populations is strongest .",
    "the results of our simulation show a trend qualitatively consistent with that found in the observational data : as 2 g stars diffuse from the inner regions ( where they formed and are initially segregated ) , they populate the outer cluster regions preferentially on radial orbits as shown by the increasing radial anisotropy of the 2 g population .",
    "the trend found in our simulation agrees with what was found in a recent numerical study by @xcite .",
    "the different formation and dynamical history of 1 g and 2 g stars , which are currently located in the same outer region of the cluster ( in this case between 1.5 and 2 @xmath3 ) , is revealed by the differences in the kinematic properties .",
    "these differences are stronger in the cluster s outer regions , which are initially dominated by 1 g stars . as the cluster evolves , the cluster s outer regions are populated also by 2 g stars , diffused from their initial inner location .    the inset of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] shows the time evolution of the mean of the ratio of the 1 g to the 2 g @xmath38 and @xmath52 , measured between 1.5 and 2@xmath53 .",
    "the initial differences in the @xmath38 and @xmath52 of the two populations evolve in a direction consistent with the observed trends :  the radial velocity dispersion @xmath38 of the two populations becomes increasingly similar while @xmath52 of the 2 g becomes smaller than that of the 1 g and , in agreement with our observational findings .",
    "it is this difference that is responsible for the differences in the anisotropy of the two populations .",
    "in this letter we have presented an _",
    "hst _ study of the kinematical properties of the msps of ngc  2808 based on high - precision pm measurements @xcite . in a recent study , @xcite identified five different populations in this cluster :  two of these populations ( named d and e ) correspond to the 2 g populations in the mms and bms identified in an earlier study by @xcite while the other three populations ( a , b , and c ) correspond to the rms population in the piotto et al.s study . in this letter",
    "we show that the five stellar populations of this cluster are characterized by differences in their kinematics .    specifically , we find that in the outermost regions probed ( between 1.5 and 2 @xmath3 ) the velocity distribution of the 2 g populations d and e is radially anisotropic ( the deviation from isotropy being significant at the @xmath03.5-@xmath1 level ) .",
    "our data show that the larger radial anisotropy in the 2 g populations d and e is due to the fact that these populations have smaller tangential velocity dispersions than the other populations .",
    "qualitatively similar trends have been found by @xcite in 47  tuc .",
    "no significant differences are found in the radial velocity dispersions of all the populations and between the kinematics of population b and that of a and c ( with only possible hints of a larger @xmath38 of population a in the innermost region , a larger @xmath38 for population c in the outermost bin , and a larger @xmath52 for populations a and c in the outermost regions all at less than 2-@xmath1 level ) .",
    "the results of an n - body simulation show that the differences in both the radial anisotropy and in the tangential velocity dispersion observed for populations d and e are consistent with being the kinematical fingerprint of the diffusion of 2 g populations from the innermost regions , where they are initially concentrated , towards the cluster outer regions",
    ". a more extended survey of models , probing broader ranges of different initial conditions , is necessary to fully explore the possible evolutionary paths of the 1 g and 2 g kinematical properties and their dependence on initial conditions .    on the observational side",
    ", we emphasize the importance of extending the current study to even more external cluster regions .",
    "in fact , the outermost regions are essential for a complete characterization of a cluster s kinematical properties and , in particular , to shed light on the possible effects of the external galactic tidal field .",
    "these effects are expected to limit the outer development of the radial anisotropy and make these more isotropic ( and possibly even slightly tangentially anisotropic ) .",
    "we plan to extend the analysis presented here to other gcs as possible , using the pm catalogs of @xcite in combination with the uv photometry of @xcite .",
    "this will create a substantial case history that will help us in better understanding formation and evolution of msps in gcs .",
