    "barchans are mobile , crescent - shaped dunes that form ubiquitously atop hard , flat surfaces wherever an approximately unidirectional fluid flow transports a limited amount of bed - load sediment .",
    "barchans rarely exist in isolation but decorate desert floors , continental shelves , nvs , and celestial bodies en masse , as members of larger fields . despite differing granular materials and fluid mediums , barchans from these diverse environments share more than their mere characteristic crescent shape : the fields themselves also display common field - scale patterns .",
    "fields are typically heterogeneous , featuring large areas where dunes are concentrated and others where they are absent . where concentrated , barchans sometimes cluster into distinguishable elongated patches ( fig .  [ fig1]b.1 ) .",
    "other times barchans congregate in expansive downwind ` corridors ' where dunes maintain a roughly similar size and spacing ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]b.2 ) .",
    "however , this approximate homogeneity can be interrupted by sections of bare ground .",
    "this enigmatic structuring , with heterogeneities and homogeneities on different scales and of diverse types , is not readily explained by external forcing ( elbelrhiti et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , despite a wealth of research explaining dynamics on the scale of single dunes , how fields of similarly sized barchans can exist at all remains an open question ( e.g. , lima et al .",
    ", 2002 ; elbelrhiti et al . , 2008 ;",
    "kocurek et al . , 2010 ; gnois et al . ,",
    "2012 ) . coupled models of sediment transport and fluid dynamics explain the morphodynamic origination of individual dunes and reproduce their characteristic morphology and kinematics : barchans emerge from the instability of a flat sand bed , march incrementally forward ( via avalanching ) in the direction of the mean flow at a rate inversely related to their size , and change size as a function of the relative rate that sand is obtained across their upwind - facing ` backs ' and lost from their downwind - facing ` horns ' ( e.g. , kroy et al . , 2002 ;",
    "durn et al . ,",
    "2010 ) . given the way horn and dune width scale , larger barchans lose proportionally less sand , leading to a morphometric instability : dunes above a certain size should tend to grow without bound , while those below should tend to shrink and disappear ( e.g. , hersen et al .",
    ", 2004 ; durn et al . , 2010 )",
    ".    perhaps the persistence of collections of dunes ( hersen et al .",
    ", 2004 ; durn et al . ,",
    "2010 ) arises as the emergent result of many dunes interacting with each other , acting as a ` complex system ' ( e.g. , baas , 2007 ; gnois et al . ,",
    "other researchers have recently modeled barchan fields as complex systems , offering the potential explanation that collections of stable dunes with similar sizes could be the result of many collisions between dunes  events in which one dune impinges on another , culminating with two or more dunes moving away from each other ( lima et al . , 2002 ; diniega et al . , 2010 ;",

    "dune - size stabilization through collisions is possible if the collisions redistribute mass in a way that tends to reduce the size of the largest dunes ( diniega et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "here we explore an alternative hypothesis that collections of similarly sized dunes , as well as enigmatic dune - field structures observed in nature , emerge from different dune - dune interactions : ( 1 ) the exchange of sand produced as each dune leaks sand from its horns , feeding other dunes , and ( 2 ) dune ` calving ' events , in which a single dune produces smaller dunes from its horns ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "in contrast to the collision events driving dune - field dynamics in other dune - field models ( diniega et al . , 2010 ;",
    "durn et al .",
    ", 2011 ; gnois et al . , 2012 ) , calving redistributes mass independent of dune collisions .",
    "elbelrhiti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) posited that calving plays a key role in stabilizing dune sizes . to explore this hypothesis",
    ", we built a numerical model that treats barchans as discrete entities that obey known empirical relationships and interact according to simplified rules derived from theoretical and numerical work and from field observations .",
    "parameterizations herein ( for numeric values not reported here , see the gsa data repository1 ) are tailored to the subaerial barchans near tarfaya in the western sahara , based on extensive previous work at the dune scale ( andreotti et al . , 2002 ) and on field - scale structuring ( elbelrhiti et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "our goal is to present potential insights about field - scale organization , so we qualitatively describe our findings and save statistical characterizations of output for ensuing efforts .",
    "barchans are typically separated from one another by bare ground so we model them as individual objects , each with a finite cross - wind width , @xmath3 , down - wind length , @xmath4 , and volume approximated as a pyramid , @xmath5 ( elbelrhiti et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "in plan view , we partition @xmath3 into the characteristic features of barchan morphology , which are a central body defined by a slip face width , @xmath6 , that is flanked by two horns with a combined width , @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are numerically derived parameters ( hersen et al . ,",
    "2004 ) .",
    "an initially empty field with a crosswind width , @xmath11 , and down - wind length , @xmath12 , is resolved into square cells with sides @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , the width of an elemental dune , is equal to the fastest - growing wavelength that arises from the instability of a nearly flat sand bed . the algorithm below is iterated every time step , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a characteristic time related to how long it takes to transport the volume of sand equivalent to an elementary - dune volume , @xmath18 : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the ` saturated flux ' that a given wind regime will transport across a flat , sand - covered surface ( andreotti et al . , 2002 ) .

    "the field is supplied with a total sand flux , @xmath23 , consisting of a ` free flux ' ( wind - blown sand ) @xmath24 ( uniformly distributed along @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 , a ` bulk flux ' ( migrating dunes ) which represents the spontaneous formation of @xmath27 elemental dunes ( elbelrhiti , 2012 ) , @xmath28 positioned randomly along @xmath25 .",
    "all cells are then assigned a free flux , @xmath29 .",
    "traveling considerably faster than dunes , we propagate @xmath24 instantaneously and directly downwind ( neglecting lateral diffusion for simplicity ) so @xmath30 until a dune is encountered , and then is modified to reflect how dune morphology impacts wind - blown transport : downwind of a slipface , @xmath31 to mimic sand trapping due to boundary layer separation , while downwind of each horn , @xmath32 to capture sand leaking at the saturated rate ( hersen et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "for bulk transport , we assume no lateral migration and advance all dunes a downwind distance inversely related to @xmath3 through the bagnold - like translation speed , @xmath33 , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a numeric constant and @xmath36 is the length scale below which dunes disappear , included to improve accuracy ( elbelrhiti et al . , 2008 and references therein ) .",

    "@xmath37 ( when dunes shrink according to ( [ eq4 ] ) to the width @xmath36 , they are assumed to lose height until the slip face disappears ; dunes below @xmath36 in the model lose sand at the saturated - flux rate across their whole width . ) because barchans introduce spatiotemporal heterogeneities in @xmath29 , the location of a dune relative to upwind dunes has bearing on the first term in ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "we allow for two possible outcomes when dunes collide ( hersen and douady 2005 ; katsuki et al . , 2005 ) . if the center of mass of a dune falls within the slip face of another dune the two colliding dunes coalesce into a single composite dune that is located at their volume - weighted average position .",
    "if two dunes touch but the above condition is not met , for example contact occurs only between their horns , they remain separate . unlike the collision rules in other dune - field models ( diniega et al .",
    ", 2010 ; gnois et al . , 2012 ) , collisions in our model do not redistribute mass in a way that tends to reduce the size of large dunes .",
    "the surface of a dune is subject to the same instability affecting a flat sand bed ( fig  [ fig1]a ; elberhibiti et al . , 2005 ,",

    "all successfully calved dunes are located immediately downwind from their parent horn and are treated akin to all other dunes in subsequent time steps .",
    "this formulation allows only dunes above a certain size , @xmath41 , to produce calves . yet",
    "dunes in higher - density areas begin calving at smaller sizes ( unpublished observations ) , apparently because the turbulent wake of one dune exaggerates perturbations on a nearby downstream dune ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "we account for this by letting @xmath38 assume one of two different values depending on whether a dune is located inside or outside the wake zone of an upwind neighbor ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "we adjusted @xmath38 values so that our model dunes begin calving at widths roughly consistent with the minimum dune sizes observed to produce calves in the tarfaya dune field : @xmath42  m ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath44  m ( @xmath45 ) in ` crowded ' and ` un - crowded ' areas , respectively .",

[ fig1]c ) , consistent with the conception of barchan fields as emergent phenomena ( baas , 2007 ) : simulated dunes appear in distinct spatial arrangements as a result of small - scale processes in which the large - scale effects are not obvious . in all runs ,",
    "the sediment - flux conditions at the upwind boundary would cause any dune seeded there , if it remains in isolation , to vanish .",
    "therefore , stochastic interactions between dunes are crucial to the formation of any non - empty model dune field . by releasing sand as they vanish ,",
    "seeded dunes function as spatially concentrated sources of @xmath29 that can feed any dune , ` luckily ' located directly downwind .",
    "there is a threshold sand supply , @xmath26 , below which simulated fields remain vacant ( which varies given the probabilistic behavior of this model , as larger domains and/or longer durations both make low - frequency occurrences more likely to be observed ) and beyond which fields become increasingly more populated ( fig .  [ fig1]c ) .      when @xmath26 is relatively low , fields are sparse and dunes appear in spatially distinct patches that are elongated in the downwind direction ( fig .  [ fig1]b and [ fig1]c .",
    "as @xmath26 increases between runs and as @xmath29 increases downwind within a given run ( due to disappearing dunes ) , patches become more prevalent and individual patches also tend to host more dunes .",
    "this observed non - linear response to sand supply at the field - scale follows from single dune - scale dynamics as well as from how dunes operate as a collective , within a patch ( see supplementary material ) .",
    "as @xmath26 increases further , fields become more homogeneous in the sense that dunes are observed throughout the domain ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) , and locally within a given region , display a characteristic size ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "bare areas are interspersed among the otherwise continuous sprinkling of dunes so these fields also possesses some degree of spatial heterogeneity ( fig .",

    "histograms of different regions demonstrate that local dune size distributions near upwind boundary varies , with more crowded region hosting smaller dunes ( see fig .",

    "after dunes migrate to the downwind end of the domain , all simulated fields attain a statistically steady state ( with the exception of the occasional development of mega - dunes , see figs .",
    "[ s5 ] and [ s6 ] in the supplementary material appendix ) .",
    "despite persisting differences in the upwind portion of the domain for runs with different @xmath26 , downwind portions of fields are strikingly similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) : the dune - dune interactions , when spatially iterated between successive dunes and collections of dunes over a sufficient distance , appear to lead toward a common attractor .",
    "although most natural fields lack these expansive downwind lengths , convergent behavior could nonetheless be tested for with empirical work focused on down - wind field trends which , unlike transverse structure ( elberhiti et al . , 2008 ) , have not yet been systematically examined .",
    "this work supports the hypothesis that calving plays a fundamental role in field - scale phenomena ( elbelrhiti et al . , 2005 ) . because the collision rules in our model do notfavor the stabilization of dune sizes , collisions play no direct role in overcoming the morphometric instability as they do in other models ( diniega et al . , 2010 ; gnois et al . , 2012",
    ")  in fact , collisions in our model can produce an anticipated instability leading to runaway growth as an anomalously large dune moves more slowly than upstream neighbors ( e.g. hersen et al .",
    ", 2004 ) , which occurs very rarely given the regional consistency of dune sizes and therefore migration rates ( figs .",
    "[ s5 ] and [ s6 ] ) .",
    "although we believe our collision rules are physically reasonable , we have chosen not to construct rules that would contribute to stabilizing dune sizes , to increase the clarity of our numerical experiments testing the importance of inter - dune sand exchanges through free flux and calving .",
    "when the calving process is disabled , dunes grow without bound and fields lack any resemblance to natural ones ( figs .",
    "[ s7 ] and [ s8 ] ) . when enabled , calving  a sand loss term unaccounted for in eq .",
    "[ eq4 ]  prevents this runaway growth and allows patterns to develop which maintain a roughly realistic appearance . in our model ,",
    "based on field observations ( elbelrhiti et al . , 2005 ) and numerical modeling ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) , imminent dune collisions can produce calving , as the perturbation to the wind field caused by an upstream dune enhances the formation of superimposed bedforms on a nearby dune .",
    "thus , this work suggests that collisions help stabilize dune sizes through their effect on calving .    in our model , although a dune much larger than @xmath41 can calf as frequently as successive waves can migrate to the end of their host horn , as a growing dune reaches @xmath41 and ejects a calf , its volume is diminished and its width drops below @xmath41 , interrupting the process . after recovering enough sand to again surmount @xmath41 ,",
    "it then calves and ceases calving once again . in the model ,",
    "this negative feedback keeps dunes within a narrow width range and leads to what , locally at the community scale , is a ` single ' stable size ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the time between two successive calving events depends on @xmath3 : larger dunes recover sand more quickly and therefore also release it more rapidly downwind by calving at a higher rate . additionally , because the sand supply within a field is inherently stochastic , calving is also stochastic and is moderated by the behavior of neighboring dunes .",
    "for example , noting that dunes are typically centered on the horn of an upwind neighbor , a dune can absorb a calf too  which would cause a dune just below @xmath41 to become large enough to calve again . therefore equation  [ eq4 ] is only loosely applicable to dunes in structured fields where the rate of sand gains and losses appears coupled .",
    "short - term empirical measurements grounded our formulation of the calving process ( elbelrhiti et al . , 2005 ) ,",
    "and longer - term empirical observations , for example on the relationship between calving frequency and dune size and field density , is needed to evaluate whether or not this calving - frequency - regulation mechanism occurs in natural dune fields too .",
    "the correspondence between the characteristic dune size of a region and @xmath41  either the crowded or un - crowded value ( figs .  [ fig2 ] and [ s10 ] )  also points to calving as the model mechanism regulating dune size .",
    "moreover , the emergent , inverse relationship between the size and density is consistent with the structuring observed in the tarfaya dune field ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; elbelrhiti et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "if this mechanism regulates dune size in nature , it is still unclear how different corridors hosting different sized dunes , and therefore by inference different calving sizes , can be juxtaposed within the same field .",
    "the only plausible explanation offered by this model is regional variation in sand supply .",
    "this suggestion is consistent with field data ( elbelrhiti et al . , 2008 ) if they are reinterpreted in light of the non - linear response of the model system to variations in input flux : the differences in regional sand fluxes within the tarfaya field ( @xmath48 ) are significant enough to cause different characteristic dune sizes in the model , near the sand source ( i.e. in the upwind portions of the modeled fields ; fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and could result from regional variations in lithology , topography , or fluxes at the field boundaries .",
    "although some of the parameterizations in this exploratory modeling effort are not tightly constrained , the results presented here arise from what we believe are the most reasonable choices among the simple formulations we have experimented with . in addition , as long as calving is incorporated in the model , varying most parameters alters the range of input fluxes that produce the various patterns and behaviors , but does not fundamentally change the qualitative results we have emphasized here . in particular , the emergence from internal dynamics of spatial heterogeneity within a field  including patchiness at relatively low input fluxes and variations in dune density with higher sediment supplies ",
    "results robustly from combinations of parameterizations we have tried .",
    "the numerical modeling results show that a rich array of dune field - scale phenomena could be emergent results of collections of barchan dunes interacting with each other in relatively simple ways .",
    "dune - field patterns , including spatially intermittent patterns with characteristic elongated structures , and denser corridors of similarly sized dunes with internal spatial heterogeneity , arise from two main dune - interaction mechanisms : ( 1 ) the exchange of sand via free flux ( lost from the horns and intercepted on the upwind flanks ) ; and ( 2 ) the calving of small dunes from the horns of sufficiently large parent dunes .",
    "the dune collision rules in this work do not play a role in counteracting the morphometric instability predicted on the basis of single - dune models , showing that the existence of collections of stable - sized dunes could result from calving , rather than from collisions . changing the flux of sand input at the upwind boundary of the domain",

    "<S> in nature , barchan dunes typically exist as members of larger fields that display striking , enigmatic structures that can not be readily explained by examining the dynamics at the scale of single dunes , or by appealing to patterns in external forcing . to explore the possibility that observed </S>",
    "<S> structures emerge spontaneously as a collective result of many dunes interacting with each other , we built a numerical model that treats barchans as discrete entities that interact with one another according to simplified rules derived from theoretical and numerical work and from field observations : ( 1 ) dunes exchange sand through the fluxes that leak from the downwind side of each dune and are captured on their upstream sides ; ( 2 ) when dunes become sufficiently large , small dunes are born on their downwind sides ( ` calving ' ) ; and ( 3 ) when dunes collide directly enough , they merge . </S>",
    "<S> results show that these relatively simple interactions provide potential explanations for a range of field - scale phenomena including isolated patches of dunes and heterogeneous arrangements of similarly sized dunes in denser fields . </S>",
    "<S> the results also suggest that ( 1 ) dune field characteristics depend on the sand flux fed into the upwind boundary , although ( 2 ) moving downwind , the system approaches a common attracting state in which the memory of the upwind conditions vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this work supports the hypothesis that calving exerts a first - order control on field - scale phenomena ; it prevents individual dunes from growing without bound , as single - dune analyses suggest , and allows the formation of roughly realistic , persistent dune field patterns .    </S>",
