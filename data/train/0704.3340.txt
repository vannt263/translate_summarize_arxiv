    "the universal extra dimension ( ued ) scenario @xcite , where all standard model ( sm ) fields can propagate into the compactified extra dimension(s ) , has attracted a lot of interest recently . in the minimal version of ued",
    "( hereafter called mued ) @xcite , there is only one extra dimension @xmath0 compactified on a circle of radius @xmath1 .",
    "every sm particle is associated with an infinite but discrete tower of similar particles , the @xmath2-th level ( this will be called the kaluza - klein , or kk , number ) of which has a tree - level mass of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass of the sm particle . since momentum along the fifth dimension is conserved , so is the kk number .    to get chiral fermions in 4-dimensional theories",
    ", one needs an @xmath5 orbifolding , identifying @xmath0 with @xmath6 in the interval @xmath7 .",
    "the kk number , however , can be violated radiatively .",
    "such loop diagrams are divergent and one needs to introduce suitable counterterms located at the fixed points @xmath8 to cancel those divergences .",
    "these counterterms depend on the effective cut - off of the theory , @xmath9 , which , for any realistic model , should be much higher than @xmath10 .",
    "the kk particle masses and mixing matrices are modified because of finite corrections coming from lorentz invariance violating loops and log - divergent ( @xmath11 ) contributions coming from terms located at the fixed points ( the so - called boundary corrections ) @xcite .",
    "this causes significant splitting among the particle masses of any kk level and has important effects on collider phenomenology .",
    "it is also possible to violate the kk number by two units , though the kk - violating terms are of much weaker strength .",
    "the kk - parity , defined as @xmath12 , is still conserved , and the lowest @xmath13 particle is stable . for all practical purposes , the lightest kk particle",
    "( lkp ) , @xmath14 , is the excitation of the hypercharge gauge boson @xmath15 , and is an excellent cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate @xcite .",
    "the data on cdm density translates into an upper limit of @xmath10 , which is about 1 tev @xcite , so that the universe is not overclosed .",
    "we do not consider the gravitons in the mued model .",
    "the importance of collider phenomenology for tev - scale extra dimensional models is well - known @xcite .",
    "the signatures of mued in @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 colliders have been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "data on low - energy observables indicate that @xmath19 - 300 gev @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the process @xmath20 suggests that it can be even higher , about 600 gev @xcite . the question whether mued can be discriminated from supersymmetric models with a similar mass spectrum",
    "@xcite has apparently been resolved with the answer being positive @xcite .",
    "the signals for excited quark and lepton production and their subsequent decay are quite clean , in the sense that there are only two relevant parameters , @xmath10 and @xmath9 , and so the predictive power of the model is high .",
    "the so - called  smoking gun \" signal of mued , namely , the @xmath21 gauge boson production , has also been investigated in the context of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite and the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite .    while the mued model is completely parametrised by @xmath10 and @xmath9 , one may add a mass - like term @xmath22 for the scalars , which is situated symmetrically at the two fixed points @xmath23 and @xmath24 . since it is the excitation of the higgs sector that we are interested about , we will keep this term as a free parameter .",
    "so , strictly speaking , we are considering the mued model expanded to include the scalar mass term @xmath22 .",
    "the effect of this term was never seriously investigated , apart from a study in the context of the ilc @xcite .",
    "the term affects only the masses of the higgs boson excitations , and hence the production and decay of those scalars .",
    "once the excited leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons are discovered at the lhc , it becomes mandatory to explore the higgs sector , not only to complete the ued spectra but also to have an idea of @xmath22 , assuming that the sm higgs boson would be discovered and precisely studied by then .",
    "unfortunately , it seems a major challenge to the experimentalists to detect these excited scalars @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the signal , for most part of the parameter space , is one or more very soft @xmath25-leptons , often below the detection limit of the atlas or the cms detectors .",
    "however , it is not impossible , and we discuss in this letter , albeit qualitatively , why the task is challenging and how one should address the question .",
    "it goes without saying that for this study to be meaningful , lhc must first discover and identify mued , through the detection of excited leptons , quarks , and gauge bosons , so that one has at least a rough idea about @xmath26 and maybe about @xmath9 .",
    "the paper has been arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly review the mued higgs sector and the third generation quark sector at the @xmath13 level .",
    "we show the possible production and decay modes of these higgs bosons . in section iii",
    ", we obtain the cross - section of the charged scalar at the lhc .",
    "the signal as well as possible backgrounds are identified .",
    "we highlight the major challenge in detecting the signal , and the way to overcome the challenge by a careful study of the polarisation of the final - state @xmath25 lepton . in section",
    "iv we take up the study for neutral scalars . we find that this sector remains a challenge even at the lhc",
    ". we comment and conclude in section v.",
    "in mued , a five - dimensional field can be fourier expanded as _ + ( x^,y ) & = & _ + ^(0)(x^ ) + _ n=1^ _ + ^(n ) ( x^ ) , + _",
    "-(x^,y ) & = & _ n=1^ _ -^(n ) ( x^),where @xmath27 is even and @xmath28 is odd under @xmath29 .",
    "fields which are odd under the @xmath29 orbifold symmetry do not have zero modes .",
    "only even fields have zero modes , which are identified with the sm particles .",
    "the scalar fields are @xmath29-even , so are the first four components of the gauge fields .",
    "the @xmath2-th level higgs field is parametrised as h_n= where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the excitations of cp - even neutral , cp - odd neutral , and charged scalars respectively ( the subscript refers to the kk number ) .",
    "there are three more colour neutral scalars , which are the fifth components of the excitations of the weak gauge bosons .",
    "these fields are @xmath29-odd and can occur first at the @xmath13 level .",
    "each of them mixes with the corresponding goldstone excitations , and produce one goldstone at the excited level ( which gets eaten up by the corresponding gauge boson to make it massive ) .",
    "the other component remains in the physical spectrum .",
    "the goldstone combinations are given by g^0_n= , and g^_n=. the orthogonal combinations are the physical scalar fields , and we will call them @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively",
    ". the excitation of the sm higgs boson will be denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath35 , the @xmath36 goldstones are essentially the fifth components of the gauge bosons , whereas the physical scalars are the excitations of the @xmath37 goldstones and the @xmath37 higgs boson .",
    "we will work in this limit only .",
    "it will be shown that only in the large @xmath26 limit one may expect to observe some signal events .    in the absence of radiative corrections ,",
    "the tree - level masses of the excited scalars are given by m_h_n , a_n^0,h_n^^2= + m_h , z , w^^2 , [ higgstree ] but this relation is modified by radiative corrections , whose effect is simply to add a universal term @xmath38 to the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ higgstree ] ) @xcite .",
    "the radiative correction is given by m_h^2 = + , [ radcorhiggs ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the @xmath41 and @xmath42 gauge couplings respectively , and @xmath43 is the self - coupling of the higgs boson , given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 gev .",
    "@xmath9 is the effective cutoff scale and @xmath46 is the regularisation scale . for @xmath13",
    ", we put @xmath47 .",
    "the term @xmath22 is arbitrary ; this is the boundary mass term for the excited scalars , and is not _ a priori _ calculable .",
    "along with @xmath26 and @xmath9 , @xmath22 forms the complete set of input parameters to specify our version of the minimal ued model ( of course , one needs to know the sm higgs boson mass , @xmath48 ) .",
    "note that in the presence of these fixed point located terms , the orbifold @xmath29 is no longer a good quantum number .",
    "if the terms are symmetrically located at the fixed points , only the kk - parity , defined as @xmath12 , is conserved .",
    "only the @xmath29-even states mix with each other , since the wavefunctions for the @xmath29-odd states vanish identically at the fixed points . of course , all scalars are @xmath29-even , so the mixing is theoretically relevant for us . if we wish to keep the orbifold @xmath29 as an almost good quantum number , the mixing between different kk - levels should be small .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath49 gev and @xmath50 gev , @xmath51 gev@xmath52 gives a one percent mixing between @xmath37 and @xmath21 states .",
    "let us take this to be the limit and keep the magnitude of @xmath22 to be less than @xmath53 gev@xmath52 .",
    "let us concentrate on the @xmath13 level and note a few points here following eqs .",
    "( [ higgstree ] ) and ( [ radcorhiggs ] ) .    *",
    "the hierarchy @xmath54 is fixed .",
    "however , the splitting among these levels is not . *",
    "if we keep @xmath10 and @xmath9 fixed , the scalar masses depend on @xmath22 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , for larger sm higgs mass ( _ i.e. _ , for larger @xmath43 ) , @xmath55 and @xmath56 masses go down if we keep @xmath22 fixed . * on the other hand , @xmath57 will become more massive , because of the positive @xmath58 contribution in eq .",
    "( [ higgstree ] ) . * for a fixed sm higgs mass , all excited scalar masses increase with increasing @xmath22 . since @xmath22 is arbitrary , it can even be negative .",
    "however , for _ large _ negative values of @xmath22 , @xmath55 will become the lkp , which is forbidden from astrophysical considerations .",
    "thus , we have a lower limit on @xmath22 , which is a function of @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and the sm higgs mass @xmath48 .",
    "the variation of the scalar masses is shown in fig .",
    "[ higgsmass ] .",
    "since the kk - parity is conserved , the scalars must decay leptonically , as all @xmath13 quarks are heavier than these scalars .      the @xmath13 fermions can be both @xmath29-even ( left doublet and right singlet ) and @xmath29-odd ( left singlet and right doublet ) .",
    "these states are mass eigenstates for all fermions , except for the third generation quarks . in the doublet - singlet basis ,",
    "the top quark mass matrix is written as where @xmath59 are the radiative corrections for the singlet ( doublet ) fields .",
    "their expressions can be found in @xcite .",
    "after diagonalisation and a chiral rotation , one gets the mass eigenstates @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is dominantly singlet ( doublet ) , the composition being somewhere between 97 - 100% , depending upon the value of @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath61 is slightly more massive than @xmath60 and hence we expect a marginally larger cross - section for @xmath60 pair production than that for @xmath61 at the lhc .",
    "the same mechanism works for the leptons",
    ". we will be interested in @xmath13 @xmath25 leptons , for which the off - diagonal terms are much smaller than those for the top quark .",
    "still , this makes @xmath62 , the dominantly singlet one , the lightest charged @xmath13 lepton .",
    "we refer the reader to fig.[higgsmass ] for an idea about the mass spectra of the lkp , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .      for",
    "most of the parameter space @xmath65 decays into @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( the subscripts stand for the kk levels ) .",
    "the @xmath68 will cascade down to @xmath69 plus lkp ( similarly for @xmath70 ) , so the final state is a soft @xmath25 plus large missing energy .",
    "however , this channel may not always be kinematically open . with increasing @xmath10 ( keeping @xmath48",
    "fixed ) , or with increasing @xmath48 ( keeping @xmath10 fixed ) , @xmath65 comes closer to @xmath68 and ultimately goes below it .",
    "this closes the two - body channel , leading to three - body channels @xmath71 plus lkp , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are @xmath37 fermions .",
    "even before this takes place , the final state @xmath25 becomes so soft as to miss detection and @xmath65 decays invisibly .",
    "the point where the transition takes place is shown in fig .",
    "[ twobody ] as a function of @xmath22 .",
    "for example , if @xmath74 tev and @xmath75 , the two - body channel will be open only if @xmath76 gev .",
    "this can also be guessed from fig .",
    "[ higgsmass ] by looking at the mass difference of @xmath55 and @xmath62 , which should be more than @xmath77 for two - body channels to remain open .",
    "channels close but the channel @xmath78 remains open . we do not spend any further time on that region , since such soft muons will definitely be missed by the detector",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ twobody ] is drawn taking the muon channel into account . ]",
    "we consider only the two - body decays of @xmath65 .",
    "note that the charged higgs is still short - lived enough to decay within the detector .    for all practical purposes , @xmath13 neutral higgs bosons @xmath57 and @xmath79 decay into one @xmath13 and one @xmath37 @xmath25 lepton ( charged or neutral ) , as long as the tree - level two - body channel remains open .",
    "when this becomes kinematically forbidden , they decay into a photon and the lkp @xmath14 , the amplitude being dominated by the top quark loop . again",
    ", we consider only the @xmath25 signal in the final state .",
    "it should now be clear why the detection of such higgs bosons is going to be a major challenge .",
    "all of them ultimately decay to one or two @xmath25 leptons , but they are going to be soft since most of the energy is carried away by the lkp . the detection limit @xmath80 gev , which we take to be the case for cms and atlas , removes almost all the signal events .",
    "thus the scalars may go undetected , even though the production cross - section is large .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the charged higgs signals in the @xmath25 channel in supersymmetry or two - higgs doublet models , where the daughter @xmath25 must be hard and easily detectable .",
    "note that when the two - body channels are closed , the @xmath37 fermion - antifermion pair must be softer , since the mass splitting between the scalars and the lkp goes down .",
    "let us first study the charged higgs boson production at the lhc .",
    "the projected annual luminosity is about 100 fb@xmath82 ; throughout the study we take this as the benchmark luminosity .",
    "we will vary @xmath10 and go upto @xmath74 tev , mostly because the dark matter density reaches the overclosure bound , and also for the simple fact that beyond this , the number of final soft-@xmath25 events after all the kinematic cuts is too low for detection .",
    "the dominant production mechanism is through the real production of @xmath13 top pair @xmath83 .",
    "all scalars are @xmath29-even , and so are all @xmath37 particles , so only the decay of the @xmath29-even @xmath60 matters .",
    "this is dominantly su(2 ) singlet , and so will decay almost entirely to @xmath84 ( the @xmath29-odd @xmath60 will also decay through the same channel after a vectorial mass insertion ) . at the leading order ( lo ) ,",
    "the gluon - gluon fusion is the dominant mechanism over @xmath85 fusions .",
    "however , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions should be significant . even the pure qcd contributions depend on @xmath26 .",
    "nlo corrections are not exactly identical to those for @xmath86 production . for example , in the one - loop virtual correction to the @xmath87 process ( which , by interference with the lo term , produces an @xmath88 correction ) , the heavy @xmath13 gluons , apart from @xmath37 gluons , also participate .",
    "in fact , to evaluate such terms , one needs to sum a series of contributions coming from higher kk modes . ]",
    "the nlo correction to the lo process is yet to be computed ; so we take @xmath89 , defined as @xmath90 , to be the same as of the sm process @xmath91 .",
    "this procedure , arguably , is open to criticism ; in particular , one may point out that @xmath89 should be a function of @xmath10 , and as one goes to large @xmath10 , the relative importance of @xmath85 fusion increases .",
    "we equate the regularisation and the factorisation scales @xmath92 ( not to be confused with the @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ radcorhiggs ] ) ) , and evaluate the cross - section at three different points : @xmath93 , @xmath10 , and @xmath94 .",
    "this , hopefully , makes the result more stable with respect to the higher order corrections .",
    "calchep v2.4.5 @xcite is used for calculation of the cross - sections as well as event distributions .",
    "the minimal ued model has been added to the basic calchep kernel by us .",
    "( the necessary files may be obtained by writing to one of us ; however , pythia interfacing is not yet implemented . )",
    "we use the mrst parton distribution at the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) level .",
    "the @xmath89-factors , for the three choices of @xmath46 mentioned above , are 1.23 , 1.43 , and 1.59 respectively @xcite .",
    "we expect a further 20% uncertainty from different choices of the parton distribution functions @xcite .",
    "the production cross - sections for @xmath60 and @xmath61 pairs are plotted in fig .",
    "[ topprodfig ] .    all subdominant @xmath55 production mechanisms ( even when taken together ) , like vector boson fusion or @xmath95 through quark box , have smaller cross - sections than the inherent qcd uncertainty of real @xmath13 top pair production",
    "; one must remember that two @xmath13 particles must be produced together .",
    "for this reason we concentrate _ only _ on the production of @xmath55 through real @xmath60 decay . in fig .",
    "[ topprodfig ] , we show the production cross - section of both @xmath96 and @xmath97 pairs as a function of @xmath10 with @xmath98 ; at this point the value of @xmath22 is irrelevant .",
    "the production is through strong interaction but the @xmath61 pair production cross - section is slightly smaller due to its higher mass .",
    "the lighter top @xmath60 decays almost entirely to @xmath99 and hence to the @xmath100 channel .",
    "if we stick to the two - body decay channels of @xmath55 , the decay mode @xmath101 opens only at very high @xmath22 ( @xmath102 gev@xmath52 ) and quickly becomes the only significant channel , but before that @xmath103 is the dominant channel and @xmath104 is the subdominant one .",
    "the latter has a branching fraction of about 10% for @xmath105 gev , but quickly drops to zero for larger @xmath10 . for this work",

    "[ neutprod](a ) we show the branching fractions of @xmath160 and @xmath119 to @xmath57 and @xmath79 ; all of them are small .",
    "the production cross - section for @xmath57 and @xmath79 is shown in fig .",
    "[ neutprod](b ) .",
    "the difference is mainly due to the kinematic factors .",
    "the neutral higgses decay , wherever kinematically possible , almost entirely to @xmath125 . for @xmath160 pair production",
    ", the signal will be where one @xmath160 decays to a neutral higgs and the other decays to @xmath122 .",
    "if we stress on the detection of at least one @xmath25 , which is the best that we can do , the signal will be two hard @xmath107 jets plus one @xmath25 plus large missing energy , which is identical to the signal of @xmath144 .",
    "therefore the backgrounds will be identical as discussed earlier .",
    "however , the signal cross - section is smaller than the charged higgs cross - section by at least two orders of magnitude , so even with the use of @xmath25 polarisation , detection of any excess event over the charged higgs signal has a pretty bleak prospect .",
    "one can also produce @xmath119 pairs .",
    "here one @xmath119 decays to @xmath124 ; thus , a possible signal event can be @xmath161 plus missing energy , where all the leptons are soft .",
    "while this signal can hardly come from charged higgs production , a significant background is the production of two @xmath124s , one going to @xmath162 and the other to @xmath163 , accompanied by missing energy .",
    "even here , after the @xmath109 cut is applied , the signal becomes miniscule to the background , but one may try to apply the @xmath25 polarisation technique to extract the neutral higgs signal .    if the neutral higgs ( in particular @xmath79 , which is always slightly lighter than @xmath57 ) can not decay to @xmath125 , it will have a two - body loop decay , going into a photon and the lkp .",
    "the signal will be entirely different  two hard @xmath107 jets plus a very soft photon plus large missing energy .",
    "there are a number of possible backgrounds that may swamp the signal , most dominant being the @xmath160 pair production with an initial or a final - state soft photon .",
    "at the first excited level , the minimal ued model contains three scalars : one charged , and two neutral .",
    "their masses depend on four parameters : @xmath26 , @xmath9 , @xmath22 , and @xmath48 , the sm higgs mass . just like any other kk excitation",
    ", the scalar masses increase with increasing @xmath26 and @xmath9 , and also with increasing @xmath22 , a parameter on which no other kk excitations depend . the mass of @xmath57 increases but the masses of @xmath55 and @xmath56 decrease with increasing @xmath48 .",
    "we have discussed how one may try to detect these scalars at the lhc .",
    "these higgses can decay only leptonically ( _ i.e. _ , only to @xmath25 ) , and the spectrum dictates that the @xmath25s must be soft .",
    "this poses a serious challenge in their detection , since lhc should not be able to detect @xmath25s with @xmath164 gev .",
    "in fact , if the limit is set higher , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath165 gev , as done in a recent atlas study @xcite , all signal events are certainly going to be missed or completely swamped by the background .",
    "the charged higgs @xmath65 can be copiously produced as the first - level decay product of @xmath13 top quark which is dominantly singlet .",
    "the signal will be two hard @xmath107 jets , at least one @xmath25 with @xmath108 gev and large missing energy .",
    "the detector limitation for identifying the @xmath25 removes the majority of the signal events .",
    "for example , we do not envisage the observation of any signal below @xmath166 gev ( that is why we safely assumed the higgses to be pure goldstone excitations ) .",
    "the major backgrounds come from the decay of @xmath132 and @xmath124 .",
    "however , @xmath25s coming from them are mostly left - chiral , while the @xmath25s coming from the decay of @xmath65 are mostly right - chiral .",
    "one may significantly reduce the background and sharpen the signal by looking at the distribution of final - state mesons in one - prong hadronic decays of the @xmath25 .",
    "the detection of neutral higgses is far more challenging , simply because their production rate is much smaller than that of the charged higgs .",
    "one possible way out may be to look for the signal @xmath167 plus missing energy , where the @xmath107 jets are hard but all leptons are soft .",
    "the background is still severe , but this is one place where one may get encouraging results by applying the @xmath25 polarisation method .",
    "we have assumed 100% tagging efficiency for the @xmath107 jets .",
    "realistically , this should be something like 60% .",
    "both signal and background event rates should be scaled down by @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the @xmath107-tagging efficiency ( so a factor of 0.36 for 60% efficiency ) .",
    "we have also assumed 100% efficiency for @xmath170 or @xmath46 detection .",
    "a more thorough study is needed which would include a full detector simulation ( here we have only simulated the events upto the production of @xmath69 ) as well as the simulation of the final - state decay products of @xmath25 . in summary",
    ", we urge our experimental colleagues to look for these unusual higgs decay signals  higgses that appear hadrophobic in nature and to complicate the matter , give only soft @xmath25s . if we are stuck in some unfavourable corner of the parameter space , all higgses may be invisible . even if they are not , this is probably one of the stiffest challenge to the higgs hunters .",
