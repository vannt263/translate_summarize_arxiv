    "the two - photon transition form factors of the light pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath4 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 ) are being intensively discussed during the last years .",
    "recently the babar experiment has provided us with new information in the region where the virtuality of the first photon is high ( @xmath6 ) and that of the second one is small ( and both photons are spacelike )  @xcite .",
    "the process , which gives an access to the given kinematic region , is @xmath7 in the `` single - tag '' mode , see fig .",
    "[ fig : single - double - tag ]  ( left ) . within the range of the previous experiments (",
    "cello  @xcite , cleo  @xcite ) there was a fair agreement with the theory .",
    "the results of babar on the pion transition form factor  @xcite demonstrated an unexpected deviation from the established theoretical predictions and has triggered the reconsideration of the theoretical description of these form factors  @xcite . over the last year several theoretical advances appeared , which were able ( or at least claimed to be able ) to reconcile theory and experiment ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) for the @xmath8 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 simultaneously . nevertheless , there are also indications that the data of ref .",
    "@xcite on @xmath8 can not be easily accommodated by theory ( see  @xcite ) . therefore , there are still open questions and further research is foreseen both on the theory and the experiment side .",
    "the new experiments , e.g. , kloe-2  @xcite , and bes - iii  @xcite will soon start measuring the two - photon form factors of the light pseudoscalars and related observables . in case of a double - tag experiment , see fig .",
    "[ fig : single - double - tag ]  ( right ) , the form factor as a function of both photon virtualities is potentially of interest .",
    "currently , the double - tag experiments are the one performed with the kedr detector at novosibirsk  @xcite and the one performed by kloe-2 collaboration at frascati  @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", in the above experiments the shape of the form factor as a function of both photon virtualities is not accessible .",
    "notice that the form factor unknown dependence on the second photon virtuality has possible impact on the precision of the experimental extraction of the quoted values of the form factor even in case of a single - tag experiment , as has been stressed in  @xcite and studied in  @xcite . in any case , a realistic simulation has to account for both photon virtualities .",
    "the transition form factor description is not only a milestone in our understanding of the @xmath9 axial anomaly  @xcite , general principles of the strong interaction dynamics  @xcite and @xmath10 flavor symmetry breaking  @xcite , but it is also very important in the context of the standard model tests at low energy  @xcite , mainly in the problem of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath11 .",
    "the transition form factors ( though in a different kinematic region ) are required for the calculation of the hadronic light - by - light ( hlbyl ) scattering part of the @xmath11 usually denoted as @xmath12  @xcite . in view of the new @xmath13 experiments to be carried out at fermilab  @xcite and jparc  @xcite , it is crucial to improve the accuracy of @xmath12  . in context of hlbyl",
    "the improvement of the models for the two - photon form factors is important , which requires the high precision of the form factor measurements  @xcite . in turn ,",
    "precision measurements require precision simulation .",
    "summing up , the state of the art is that both theory and experiment need a computer program for the process @xmath7  the monte carlo generator , which would allow to simulate the events under the conditions similar to the experimental ones .",
    "our objective is to develop and to maintain a free and public tool for @xmath7 simulation ( @xmath8 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 ) to be used by experimentalists and theorists .",
    "the guiding principles are the following :    * to account for light meson phenomenology in detail via precise modeling of the form factors , in agreement with available data ; * full description of both virtual photons ; * high generator efficiency : accounting for the peaking behaviour of the cross section .",
    "this approach is being realized in the monte carlo generator ekhara  @xcite  . in the following section we review the current status of this program .",
    "the monte carlo generator ekhara is a computer program written in fortran using the quadruple precision numbers . the principal description of the program is given in the dedicated paper  @xcite .",
    "the generator can be used a stand - alone code or be interfaced to another ( e.g. , an experiment s ) simulation program .    the first version of ekhara  @xcite allows to simulate the reaction @xmath14 with the focus on a specific event selection , namely that of the radiative return method for cross section @xmath15 measurement .",
    "it was used for the background  @xcite simulation by kloe collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this channel can be important for the radiative return program of the bes - iii experiment  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 mode in ekhara has the following features , which a user should be aware of : it generates weighted events and the applied phenomenology of the @xmath16 subprocess _ is not _ tuned to reflect the line shapes known from the dedicated @xmath16 experiments .",
    "an improvement of the above issue is on the agenda .    the second version of ekhara  @xcite features a new channel , @xmath7 .",
    "the implementation of this channel and the applied phenomenology _ is _ oriented on the @xmath17 physics .",
    "the phase space construction and the matrix element calculation is based on the exact formulae and the exact kinematics ( in contrast to the equivalent photon approximation , which was used in many generators in this field ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the ( user - provided ) form factors in ekhara have to be meaningful both in the time - like and space - like regions of the photon , because both @xmath18- and @xmath19-channel amplitudes and their interference can be switched on in the simulation , see fig .  [ fig : s - t ] . in general , the provided form factors have to be functions of _ two _ photon virtualities .",
    "the above criteria considerably reduces the user s choice , because the majority of the published formulae for the form factors within different theoretical approaches hold only for the case with one photon being real and the other  space - like and virtual . strictly speaking , from the point of view of the numerical simulation",
    ", such a case is very specific and is _ never _ realized for the @xmath19-channel amplitude because the leptons are not massless .    in order to support a user",
    ", we have recently  @xcite supplied ekhara with the transition form factors for @xmath8 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 mesons .",
    "inclusion of @xmath1 and @xmath5 meson production in ekhara is a new feature with respect to  @xcite .",
    "the form factor modeling  @xcite was performed in the framework of the effective field theory , namely the chiral theory with resonances  @xcite was used .",
    "the quality of the model is good : by fitting only one free parameter to the data for @xmath8 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 form factors ( simultaneously ) we achieved @xmath20 .",
    "the existing data from single - tag experiments in space - like region ( cello  @xcite , cleo  @xcite and babar  @xcite ) were used not only as a reference for model improvement , but also for the generator verification .",
    "the verification is done by comparison of the simulated cross sections @xmath21 for @xmath7 under the event selection similar to that of the single - tag experiments .",
    "the pattern of data / simulation agreement is the same as for the form factors and this is an important consistency check .",
    "recently , ekhara was used by kloe-2 collaboration  @xcite for the feasibility studies of @xmath22 @xmath8 . on the basis of simulation ,",
    "a per cent level of precision is foreseen for the measurement of @xmath23 by the kloe-2 experiment at frascati .",
    "kloe-2 experiment can also perform the first measurement of pion transition form factor @xmath24 in the space - like region in the vicinity of the origin : @xmath25 .",
    "the impact of the proposed measurements on the evaluation of the standard model prediction for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath11 , was estimated  @xcite .",
    "a brief review of the monte carlo event generator ekhara is presented with the focus on the physics motivation and several new features .",
    "it can be used for the simulation of the processes @xmath7 and @xmath26 .",
    "the channels @xmath27 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 are important for @xmath28 physics programs of the modern experiments ( e.g. , kloe-2 and bes  iii ) and can be used for the simulation of the two - photon form factor measurements at meson factories .",
    "the program is supplied with the form factors for @xmath8 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 mesons in agreement with the modern data on the transition form factors and corresponding differential cross sections @xmath21 .",
    "the future plans of ekhara development include the electromagnetic radiative corrections for the channel @xmath7 .",
    "after the inclusion of the radiative corrections we plan to perform a detailed comparison of our generator with ggresrc  @xcite , which was used by the babar experiment  @xcite . the major update of the @xmath26 channel in context of possible @xmath28 physics motivation is also foreseen .",
    "this research was partly supported by polish ministry of science and high education from budget for science for years 2010 - 2013 : grant number n  n202  102638 , by sonderforschungsbereich sfb1044 of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and by national academy of science of ukraine contract @xmath29@xmath30 .",
