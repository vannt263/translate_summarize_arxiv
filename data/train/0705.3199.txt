    "in recent years , experimental cosmology has provided strong evidence that the universe is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "the physical phenomena responsible for this expansion has proved elusive , and there are numerous theories that attempt to explain the current epoch of the universe . typically , the observed acceleration is attributed to a new energy component , dark energy , which dominates at late times .",
    "numerous models exist of this form , the simplest of which include introducing a cosmological constant @xmath1 , or alternatively a scalar field slowly rolling down a potential .    although dark energy is undoubtedly the most popular explanation of the current epoch of the universe , it is not the only way to obtain late time acceleration . in this paper",
    "we consider a class of models where gravity is modified at large scales , in such a way that the late - time expansion of the universe could arise naturally from the new gravitational field equations .",
    "these modified gravity models have been considered by numerous authors , see for example @xcite .    modifying gravity in a manner consistent with experimental data has proved difficult .",
    "general relativity ( gr ) is a very robust and well tested theory , and it has been found that even slight modifications often lead to instabilities , such as the propagation of ghosts @xcite , or in otherwise stable matter sources @xcite,@xcite . when introducing additional terms into the gravitational action , we must be careful to respect the success of gr in both the low and high curvature regimes , to ensure that any potentially new model agrees with known observational tests of gravity .    in the literature",
    ", there are numerous simple conditions that exist which restrict the form that a modified gravity model may take . in this paper",
    ", we combine all of these conditions , and in doing so find that the modified gravity function @xmath0 is well constrained , even before considering stringent experimental tests .",
    "the philosophy adopted throughout is that before attempting to reconcile any potential modified gravity model with experimental data , that modified gravity model must first satisfy these consistency requirements .",
    "we will take a trial @xmath0 model which satisfies all of the existing constraints .",
    "we find that our model exhibits a late - time accelerating solution , in the absence of a cosmological constant .",
    "we then consider the cosmology of our model , and obtain a modified friedmann equation .",
    "we show that to satisfy all constraints , and to obtain an acceptable newtonian limit for small @xmath2 , our model must act like gr with highly suppressed corrections throughout its cosmological history .",
    "in addition , we find that although our model has no true cosmological constant , we must still fine tune a particular combination of the free parameters in @xmath0 to obtain an acceptably small curvature in the current accelerating epoch .",
    "we conjecture that our results are generic features of models which satisfy the consistency requirements .",
    "before we consider a specific @xmath0 model , we first briefly review the field equations in modified gravity theories . throughout this paper , we will study the action    @xmath3    where @xmath0 is some function of the ricci scalar @xmath2 , @xmath4 is the mass scale of our model , and @xmath5 the matter action .",
    "the field equations obtained by varying the action ( @xmath6 ) with respect to the metric are    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the energy momentum tensor of any matter present .",
    "taking the trace of ( @xmath9 ) gives the more useful equation    @xmath10    where the function @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 .",
    "vacuum solutions to the field equations satisfy @xmath13 when @xmath14 , and hence @xmath15 .",
    "in addition to the above field equations in the jordan frame , we will also want to consider the potential of the scalar field in the einstein frame . to transform to the einstein frame , we first write ( @xmath6 ) as    @xmath16 + \\int \\sqrt{-g } d^{4}x{\\cal l}_{\\rm m } , \\ ] ]    where @xmath17 is the matter lagrange density .",
    "the actions ( @xmath18 ) and ( @xmath6 ) are equivalent if @xmath19 .",
    "we then use the conformal transform @xmath20 , which gives    @xmath21    where @xmath2 and @xmath22 are the ricci scalars associated with the metrics @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively . using this in ( @xmath18 )",
    "gives the following einstein frame action    @xmath25 + \\int \\sqrt{-\\tilde{g } }   d^{4}x   { 1 \\over ( f')^{2}}{\\cal l}_{\\rm m } , \\ ] ]    where the einstein frame potential is given by    @xmath26    finally , by making the field redefinition @xmath27 , we obtain    @xmath28,\\ ] ]    with potential    @xmath29e^{-2 \\sigma\\sqrt{2 } / \\sqrt{3m^{2}}}.\\ ] ]    in many instances , it is preferable to study modified gravity in the einstein frame , since the field equations are much simpler .",
    "additionally , the potential ( @xmath30 ) is useful since its critical points correspond to the vacuum solutions @xmath31 in the jordan frame .",
    "we stress that the two frames are globally equivalent only if @xmath19 .",
    "here we briefly review the constraints in the literature imposed on the form of the function @xmath0 .",
    "we begin by demanding @xmath32 and @xmath33 for all @xmath2 .",
    "the first of these is to ensure stability ; it has been shown @xcite that if @xmath34 for any @xmath2 then the model will possess ghost instabilities in this region .",
    "the second condition @xmath19 is imposed since it has been found that models which have @xmath35 will generically possess instabilities , when we consider the metric variational approach of our model @xcite .",
    "we note that the possibility of @xmath36 being zero for some @xmath2 has not been completely discounted in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , we will impose @xmath33 for all @xmath2 .",
    "the next constraint that we impose on @xmath0 is that in the limit @xmath37 , we have @xmath38 .",
    "writing @xmath39 , this implies that @xmath40 as @xmath41 .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath42 as @xmath43 , from which we can deduce that @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "this condition is imposed to ensure that the modified gravity model acts suitably like @xmath46 in the large @xmath2 regime , where gravity is well constrained by ppn constraints and the cmb .",
    "with this bound , we have @xmath42 as @xmath43 .",
    "however , in ref . @xcite it was found that for a given @xmath0 theory to be stable to perturbations in the large @xmath2 regime , we must have @xmath47 as @xmath43 .",
    "this means that @xmath48 must asymptote to unity from below , since @xmath49 implies that it must be an increasing function .",
    "next , we can use the fact that we have imposed @xmath19 for all @xmath2 .",
    "this means that there can be no turning points in @xmath48 , implying that if @xmath48 asymptotes to unity from below , then it must remain less than unity for all @xmath2 .",
    "however , we have also imposed @xmath50 . from this",
    "we conclude that @xmath48 must be an increasing function of @xmath2 , and must satisfy @xmath51 .",
    "another set of constraints on @xmath0 are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the cosmology of @xmath0 models was considered .",
    "in order for a theory to be a viable alternative to gr , it must exhibit an acceptable cosmological history , that is it must have suitable radiation , matter and late time accelerating eras .",
    "it was found that in order for a particular @xmath0 to have a valid matter era , @xmath0 must satisfy @xmath52 and @xmath53 at @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , to obtain a late time accelerating era such as we are currently in , the function @xmath59 must satisfy either ; @xmath60 @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 or @xmath64 @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "if these are not satisfied for any @xmath2 , then the model will not have an acceptable cosmological history .",
    "in this section , we give an example @xmath0 function which satisfies all of the conditions in the previous section .",
    "given that @xmath48 must be an increasing function , and lie in the range @xmath67 , an obvious choice is    @xmath68,\\ ] ]    where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are free parameters .",
    "this function has the appropriate behaviour @xmath42 as @xmath43 and @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "integrating this @xmath48 gives us    @xmath73 + a , \\ ] ]    where @xmath74 is an integration constant .",
    "we are looking for @xmath0 models that exhibit late time accelerating solutions in the absence of a cosmological constant . therefore to specify @xmath74 , we impose that @xmath75 .",
    "hence we find @xmath76 and    @xmath77.\\ ] ]    it is this @xmath0 that will be studied for the remainder of this paper .",
    "we will begin by considering some of the general properties of our model .",
    "first , we look for vacuum solutions to the field equations , that is solutions to @xmath15 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath11 is exhibited in fig .",
    "we have found that @xmath11 for our @xmath0 generically possesses three zeros , for any @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this means that our @xmath0 model can have three vacuum states , which are minkowski space ( @xmath81 ) , and two de - sitter vacua , one of which is stable .    to see these vacuum states more explicitly ,",
    "we move to the einstein frame .",
    "a plot of the potential @xmath82 for our @xmath0 is given in figs .",
    "@xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "we can clearly see that the potential has two minima , one at @xmath85 ( which corresponds to the minkowski vacuum ) and the other at some @xmath86 .",
    "this second minima corresponds to a stable de sitter vacuum solution in the jordan frame , and hence our model has a stable accelerating solution , in the absence of a cosmological constant .",
    "this is exactly the behaviour we seek .",
    "finally , the third vacuum in the jordan frame corresponds to the maxima in the potential @xmath83 , and is unstable .",
    "following @xcite , we also briefly consider the functions @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath87 for our model , as given in section @xmath88 .",
    "we plot these functions parametrically as functions of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "we see that there is a region in which @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 , which corresponds to a matter era . as @xmath43",
    ", we have @xmath93 and @xmath94 , suggesting that the condition for a matter epoch is satisfied asymptotically .",
    "further , as @xmath2 decreases , there is a region where @xmath95 , at which @xmath96 .",
    "this region corresponds to the late - time de - sitter phase .",
    "hence our model connects the points @xmath97 and @xmath98 in the @xmath99 plane , as is required @xcite for it to have an acceptable cosmic history .",
    "we now consider the newtonian limit of our model . in doing so , we will be able to constrain the free parameters @xmath79 and @xmath70",
    ". the constant @xmath79 will be fixed by the following two conditions ; we require the de - sitter vacuum solution to be @xmath100 , and as we will see shortly , we require @xmath101 . using these conditions ,",
    "the constant @xmath70 will not be fixed , but we will find that it must be large .    to see how @xmath79 and @xmath70 are determined , we consider the newtonian limit of modified gravity theories .",
    "the full field equations for the action ( @xmath6 ) are    @xmath102    we would like to perform a weak - field expansion of these equations around the de - sitter minima of our model .",
    "in doing so , we hope to obtain an acceptable newtonian limit .",
    "an analysis has been performed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , and expanding the field equations about a symmetric de - sitter vacuum gives    @xmath103    where    @xmath104    in order to obtain an acceptable newtonian limit from these perturbative equations , we require that @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a macroscopic distance . if this is the case , then the perturbative equations ( @xmath9 ) will be approximately given by    @xmath109    equation ( @xmath110 ) is simply the weak field expansion of general relativity , from which the standard newtonian limit is recovered .",
    "the only difference is the coefficient of the first term in ( @xmath110 ) , which is @xmath105 as opposed to unity .",
    "note that to obtain the correct limit we must have @xmath111 ; if this were not the case then fourth order derivative terms such as @xmath112 would be present in ( @xmath110 ) , and it has been shown that these terms would lead to strong curvature at all lengthscales @xcite .    for our model ( and generically in @xmath0 theories ) , we have @xmath113 for @xmath114 , which is the first condition to obtain an acceptable newtonian limit .",
    "however , the second condition , @xmath115 , is not generically satisfied , and we must choose our free parameters to obtain the correct behaviour . from ( @xmath116 ) , we find @xmath36 to be    @xmath117    and hence to ensure that @xmath118 is very small , we require @xmath119 .",
    "we can use this condition to fix @xmath79 in terms of @xmath120 and @xmath70 . to do so",
    ", we note that in the vicinity of the de - sitter minima , @xmath121 , we can expand @xmath0 and @xmath48 for large @xmath122 ,    @xmath123    and hence from the vacuum field equations @xmath15 , we can use our approximations ( @xmath124 ) to give    @xmath125    from which we find @xmath126 .",
    "this fixes the free parameter @xmath79 in terms of @xmath120 and the remaining free parameter @xmath70 .",
    "next , we can constrain @xmath70 from the condition @xmath127 . using this , and expanding @xmath36 in powers of @xmath128",
    ", we find that @xmath70 must satisfy    @xmath129    which is satisfied for large @xmath70 , such that @xmath130 .",
    "to review our conditions ; we are working with a model with two free parameters , @xmath79 and @xmath70 , and we have imposed two constraints on this model , which are that @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "these constraints force us to choose @xmath79 and @xmath70 such that @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "together , they imply that @xmath135 , and hence @xmath136 .",
    "we note that we have not been forced to specify the constant @xmath70 , other than imposing the condition @xmath135 .",
    "this parameter controls how closely our model mimics gr ; the larger we set @xmath70 the more suppressed our corrections @xmath137 become .    before moving onto the cosmology of our model",
    ", we remark that the above weak - field expansion was performed around the de - sitter vacuum @xmath138 .",
    "it has been noted @xcite that for local tests of gravity , the expansion should instead be around the local energy density of the solar system , which is much larger than @xmath120 . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will perform a detailed analysis of the local tests of gravity for our model , but for now we simply expand around @xmath139 . performing",
    "a weak - field expansion around a solar system background will not significantly modify our conclusion ; we are simply stating that in order to obtain an acceptable weak - field limit for small @xmath2 , we must choose the constants @xmath79 and @xmath70 such that @xmath140 is satisfied .",
    "having considered the newtonian limit of our models , we now evaluate the friedmann equation , and attempt to reconstruct the cosmic history of our models .",
    "we will find that this model mimics general relativity very closely throughout its cosmic history .",
    "to show this , we first write down the equivalent friedmann equation for a general @xmath0 model , obtained from the @xmath141 component of the field equations ( @xmath9 ) ,    @xmath142 = { \\rho \\over m^{2 } } .\\ ] ]    with our highly non - trivial @xmath0 , this equation corresponds to a complex , non linear , third - order differential equation in the scale factor @xmath79 .",
    "however , we can use our approximations ( @xmath124 ) to write ( @xmath143 ) in a much simplified form .",
    "we first note that the approximations ( @xmath124 ) are valid for the entire cosmic history of this model , because they are applicable for large @xmath144 .",
    "since @xmath145 throughout the cosmic history , and since @xmath146 is at its smallest value at @xmath138 , then given that we have constrained @xmath146 to be large at @xmath138 then it must be large for all @xmath145 .    using the approximations ( @xmath124 ) in ( @xmath143 ) , we find the following modified friedmann equation ,    @xmath147    where we have used the condition that @xmath70 must be large , and hence @xmath148 .",
    "the first two terms are what we would expect from standard general relativity with a fine tuned cosmological constant @xmath149 .",
    "the remaining terms on the left hand side are corrections to the friedmann equation , but they are highly suppressed by a factor of @xmath150 for all @xmath151 .",
    "it follows that our model will not significantly differ from standard gr .",
    "the exponentially suppressed corrections to general relativity that we have found are small in the current epoch , and decrease in significance as we track our model back through its cosmic history .",
    "additionally , we note that we still have a fine tuning problem , in that we have two free parameters , and we have chosen them specifically such that the combination @xmath152 satisfies @xmath153 .",
    "we stress however that the combination @xmath154 in ( @xmath155 ) is not a true cosmological constant ; rather our model mimics standard general relativity with a small vacuum energy .",
    "the fine - tuning found in our model is a generic feature of modified gravity theories .",
    "since we demand that @xmath156 for small @xmath2 to obtain an acceptable weak field limit , it follows that in the vicinity of the vacuum @xmath157 , we must have @xmath158 , and hence @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are constants .",
    "this means that for vacuum @xmath121 , we can expand @xmath0 in the form @xmath162 , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 will be some combination of constants in the model .",
    "this is exactly what we have done for our @xmath0 model above ; we have expanded @xmath0 as @xmath163 for @xmath121 .",
    "it follows that to obtain an acceptable vacuum solution @xmath164 , we must fine - tune the parameters in the model .",
    "the fact that our model must necessarily mimic gr with suppressed corrections is a consequence of the constraints that we have imposed .",
    "specifically , we have used the fact that to obtain an acceptable weak field expansion , we require @xmath156 for small @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we have also assumed that in the large @xmath2 regime @xmath165 , which suggests that @xmath156 as @xmath41 .",
    "since we are considering models which have @xmath19 for all @xmath2 , then it follows that @xmath36 must be small throughout the cosmic history .",
    "we expect that any @xmath0 function that satisfies the consistency conditions that we have considered will possess a friedmann equation of the form ( @xmath155 ) , that is standard gr plus @xmath1 with small correction terms .",
    "these correction terms will not necessarily be exponentially suppressed as they are for the @xmath0 considered in this paper , but they must be suppressed throughout the expansion history of the universe regardless of the particular form of @xmath0 . however , although these models will mimic gr , this does not imply that they are observationally identical to gr if we consider all aspects of gravity .",
    "for example , it might be possible to observe small corrections to gr by considering solar system tests of gravity or the binary pulsar .",
    "in a subsequent paper we hope to find distinct observational signatures of our model by analyzing local gravity constraints .    finally , we observe that the conclusions that we have reached do not apply if we were to relax any of the constraints on @xmath0 , for example by allowing @xmath166 for some @xmath2 in the past",
    ". hence it might be possible to construct an acceptable model that does not obey all of the constraints at all times , and hence will not mimic gr throughout the entire cosmic history .",
    "in addition , it is not strictly necessary for an acceptable modified gravity model to obey the consistency conditions for all @xmath2 , since they can only be probed for @xmath167 .",
    "we could have an acceptable model which has @xmath168 for some @xmath169 in the future .",
    "however , there is a possibility of such models evolving to a final state containing instabilities .",
    "we have taken the consistency constraints that exist in the literature for modified gravity models , and used them to construct a particular modified gravity function @xmath0 .",
    "a study of the model has shown that in order to satisfy all constraints , it must act like gr with highly suppressed corrections throughout cosmic history . in addition , we find that even though we do not have a true cosmological constant in our setup , we must still fine - tune the parameters in our @xmath0 function to obtain an acceptable late time accelerating epoch .",
    "although we have come to this conclusion for our specific model , we expect our results to hold true for a large class of @xmath0 models which satisfy all of the constraints that we have considered .    while we were completing this work we became aware of refs .",
    "@xcite , which come to similar conclusions . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that in order to satisfy local gravity constraints , the function @xmath55 as defined in section @xmath88 must satisfy @xmath170 for @xmath171 .",
    "this places a severe constraint upon @xmath36 , which must be very small in the current epoch of the universe .",
    "the model considered in this paper can satisfy the constraint @xmath170 by making the free parameter @xmath70 sufficiently large .",
    "however , such a stringent constraint is likely to yield a model that is virtually indistinguishable to gr .",
    "was considered , where @xmath59 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 and @xmath175 are free parameters .",
    "the model considered in this paper shares many similarities with ( @xmath176 ) ; the condition @xmath177 was imposed in ref . @xcite both at @xmath178 and as @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that the function @xmath179 can be expanded as      for small @xmath181 , which is valid throughout the cosmic history of the model .",
    "we have arrived at a very similar expansion for the @xmath0 function considered in this paper , ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "the difference between the two models is that ( @xmath182 ) contains power law corrections to gr , whereas ( @xmath124 ) contains exponentially suppressed corrections ."
