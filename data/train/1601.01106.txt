    "most probably , the founders of quantum gravity did not have high hopes that what they were doing would someday be tested or even have observational consequences .",
    "the cmb power spectrum opened that window to us and now we can name cosmological perturbations as first quantum gravitational observables that were predicted by mukhanov and chibisov @xcite for scalar part and by starobinsky @xcite for tensor part .",

    "this is mostly done in order to make precision tests of a particular model .",
    "although one would expect only corrections to already known physics by calculating these higher order terms in perturbation theory , i.e. loops , new phenomena beyond our expectations can arise as was the case in the famous 1-loop beta function calculation in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "for the last fifteen years , there have been many efforts towards understanding loops in cosmology . among these relatively large literature ,",

    "two types of infrared logarithm factors that appeared are time - dependent and time - independent .",
    "the obvious enticing aspect of time - dependent infrared logarithm is that it grows with time .",
    "having this case , the smallness of the loop counting parameter in quantum gravity gets reinforced by time - dependent infrared logarithms . if one assumes the we observe 50 e - folds of inflationary era , this time - dependent enhancement would only bring a factor of 50 , which would not give us much hope of observing this effect any time soon .",
    "most of the discussions were around the quantum corrections to 2-point correlation functions , i.e. power spectrum ; since it is a quantity which is measured more accurately .",
    "the debate between time - dependence and time - independence camp went on and both parties published explicit calculations to support their claims @xcite .",
    "the author of this work also contributed to this discussion claiming the time - dependence . in this work , we do not want to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each point of view , but rather want to point out that the `` small '' time - dependent loop effects are not really that small ; if one looks at higher orders of correlation functions such as 3-point functions and even highers .",
    "here we will show the 1-loop correction dominates the tree - level term by 30 orders of magnitude .",
    "this would immediately lead to ruling out all single field inflationary models due to observational constraints on non - gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "this claim might appear very odd , if one naively looks at the above theorem of weinberg .",
    "but it turns out that the constancy of the tree - level mode function and time - dependency of 1-loop correction determines the faith of their contribution to the 3-point function , bispectrum .",

    "we review the case of time - dependent zeta - zeta correlator arising from self interaction of zeta at 1-loop order . in section iii .",

    "it became customary to use adm formalism to get the quadratic , cubic and even higher order parts of the action .",
    "the quadratic part of the action for @xmath10 is @xcite : @xmath14\\ ] ] and the cubic part of zeta is :    @xmath15    one can vary the quadratic part of the action and equate to zero , to get the equation of motion for @xmath10 as @xmath16 the standard way of solving this equation for quantum fields is going into momentum space and expressing @xmath10 as a mode sum @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are creation and annihilation operators that obey canonical quantization conditions .",
    "it is best to go to conformal time to write the expression for the mode function , @xmath20 so that the geometry is conformally flat .",
    "another motivation for choosing conformal time is related to the fact that there is not a unique choice of vacuum in curved space .",
    "one takes the expression ( [ mod ] ) and uses that to solve equation ( [ eom ] ) for @xmath21 @xmath22 which corresponds to the positive frequency modes . by choosing conformal time for coordinate system ,",
    "it is easy to see that this solution for the mode function behaves like minkowski in the early time limit .",

    "there have been many efforts to answer this questions in the last ten years @xcite .    in a particular curious case",

    "these so called infrared logarithms , as well as @xmath30 term , enhance this 1-loop effect by 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "but the smallness of @xmath31 overshadows this enhancement and make the total 1-loop correction to be at most at the order of @xmath32 .",
    "the degree of the precision of the current experiments are well below the necessary level to untangle this 1-loop effect .",
    "but still the effect is not hopelessly small .    for the last five years",
    "there has been some discussion about the time - dependence of the @xmath10-@xmath10 correlator .",
    "it has even been claimed @xcite that this quantity is constant at all loops , which we find to be highly dubious .",
    "the point of this work is not to argue the time - dependence of @xmath10-@xmath10 correlator further but rather go in another direction ; which is loops corrections to 3-point function and to see what the consequences of time dependence of @xmath10 are .",
    "we believe that the real enhancement of time - dependent @xmath10-@xmath10 correlator arises if one calculates 3-point function for @xmath10 .",
    "it turns out the 1-loop correction to this quantity totally dominates the tree - level result .",
    "therefore the more interesting quantity to look at is not the 2-point function but rather 3-point function , which is the subject of the next section .",
    "one can write the primordial bispectrum in terms of the fourier transformed 3-point function as    @xmath33    assuming a local form for the bispectrum where the non - gaussian @xmath10 field is produced from the gaussian background @xmath34 field as @xmath35    one can show that the bispectrum peaks at the so called  squeezed \" triangle , for which one takes one wave number much smaller than the other two , i.e. @xmath36 . for the case of squeezed limit bispectrum can be expressed in terms of power spectrum as @xmath37 where the late time limit of the power spectrum is @xmath38 if creminelli - zaldarriaga consistency@xcite condition for single field inflation models hold , bispectrum in the local limit ( or squeezed - limit ) can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is called the spectral tilt index and is defined as @xmath41    instead of expressing the 3-point function in terms of 2-point functions , one can directly compute the in - in expectation value of @xmath10 and use ( [ cubic ] ) for the interaction hamiltonian and get the following expression for the bispectrum @xcite @xmath42 the main point of the calculation is the integral that we have in the above expression for the bispectrum    @xmath43    if we take the tree - order mode function for the above expression it is obvious that we will get a small non - gaussianity .",
    "this is due to the fact that the 3-point function , therefore non - gaussianity , is proportional to the change of the mode function for each wave number @xmath44 . since for each mode",
    "the mode function itself goes to a constant after the horizon crossing , change of those tree - level mode functions will be very small . on the other hand , the 2-point function , therefore power spectrum , is proportional to the magnitude of the mode function .",
    "let us highlight this point by giving equations :    @xmath45    we would like to find the answer to the following question : how big is the effect of loops to n - point functions of primordial curvature perturbation during inflation ?",
    "the answer of the above question for 2-point and 3-point functions are related to the magnitude and the time derivative of the scalar mode functions .",
    "therefore , let us give the one loop corrected mode function expression and its derivative with respect to conformal time and their long wavelength limits ( @xmath46 ) : @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    the difference between the one - loop corrected mode function s and tree - level mode function s time derivative is of the order of @xmath51 @xmath52 as expected but also multiplied with an additional factor of @xmath53 .",
    "for the super - horizon modes ( @xmath46 ) with the relevant 50 e - folds this brings an extra factor of @xmath54 which makes the 1-loop correction to dwarf the tree - level part of the mode function .",
    "the mathematical reasons for this huge effect is the following .",
    "the derivative with respect to conformal time brings an extra factor of @xmath55 when it acts on a power of @xmath2 .",
    "since the tree - level mode function is constant after horizon crossing , this time derivative does no good to boost the leading term , it simply annuls it .",
    "but for the case 1-loop corrected mode function , the time derivative acts on the @xmath56 and gives a chance to the constant leading term of the tree - level part of the mode function to survive .",
    "not only does it survive , but also it gets boosted by the extra factor of @xmath55 .",
    "since the integral that appear in the the non - gaussianity ( @xmath57 correlator ) ( [ twothree ] ) has three factors of @xmath58 the 1-loop correction to the 3-point function is 30 orders magnitude bigger than the tree - level term .",
    "if we look at equation ( [ bispec3 ] ) we can see the bigness of bispectrum can only be achieved by having a huge @xmath59 parameter , since the 1-loop correction to @xmath60 terms are very small .",
    "it also implies that creminelli - zaldarriaga consistency condition for single scalar field is not satisfied here since equation ( [ bispce1 ] ) could not be satisfied with a bispectrum this big .",
    "however this does not mean the invalidation of the consistency condition , since the condition assumes time - independency a priori .",
    "but most importantly an @xmath59 parameter of this magnitude results into ruling out all single field inflation models due to the observational limits on the non - gaussianity parameter .",
    "we would like to point out that we are not claiming weinberg s theorem is incorrect .",
    "mathematically what happens is that , the time derivative acting on the constant term , which is the leading term in the long wavelength expansion of scalar mode function kills it . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum corrected time - dependent mode functions long wavelength expansion leaves a room for the constant term to survive by letting the time derivative hit on the infrared logarithm . due to this wondrous interaction ,",
    "1-loop correction dominates the tree - level term by 30 orders of magnitude .",
    "so this does not contradict with weinberg s theorem of not being able to get positive factors of @xmath2 in perturbation theory .",
    "the integrals that appear in ( [ twothree ] ) can be evaluated @xcite analytically in a general vacuum choice , called non - bunch - davies initial state which would lead to an increase of the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath59 even at the tree - level @xcite . for the case of non - bunch - davies initial state",
    "the one - loop term again dominates the tree - level one and be ruled out as well .",
    "the success of inflationary cosmology is appalling .",
    "this simple idea solves homogeneity , flatness , horizon , isotropy and primordial monopole problems of standard cosmology with a single shot @xcite . with inflation , linking quantum physics with cosmology , we can understand the origin of all matter from primordial quantum fluctuations .",
    "getting first quantum gravitational data , such as curvature power spectrum with small error bars is a major success in itself .",
    "it is therefore time to go beyond this tree - level effect and investigate possible consequences , which we can name as precision inflationary cosmology . towards this direction ,",
    "one possible thing to do is calculating loop corrections to cosmological correlations . at first look , one would naturally think that this is a futile effort due to the smallness of the loop counting parameter @xmath61 .",
    "there was a lot of attention to loop corrections to power spectrum despite the smallness of them .",
    "cosmological loop corrections bring a typical infrared logarithm and are divided into three categories according to the form of the logarithmic factors : @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "the first case is claimed to be due to making an error in the implementing diffeomorphism invariant regularization and the second being a projection effect that will be removed if one computes observable quantities .",
    "the final case is also dismissed in the mentioned work on the grounds of some symmetry arguments as well as extrapolating this time - dependent effect to reheating and baryogenesis and claiming that predictivity of inflation will be lost .",
    "one can certainly reply to the above criticisms and perhaps one should . but in this work , we would like to bring a different viewpoint to this discussion that is more dramatic .",
    "first of all , time - dependent zeta do occur even without loop corrections , such as multi - field inflationary models and entropy perturbations .",
    "the time - dependence that we are interested in , that has the form of @xmath64 , are originated from loop corrections .",
    "we investigated the minimal case where the only scalar field is the inflaton and the dependenc .",
    "we first reviewed time - dependent loop corrections to 2-point functions , i.e. power spectrum , which arises due to @xmath10-@xmath10 self interactions at 1-loop order .",
    "they in principle are important ; on the other hand from an observational perspective are irrelevant .",
    "we took the 1-loop corrected scalar mode function and used that to correct 3-point functions and concluded that they grow with the square of the scale factor .",
    "that results into an immediate ruling out all single - scalar driven models of inflation .      1 .",
    "power spectrum is related to the magnitude of mode function . +",
    "therefore it goes like : constant(tree - level ) + a small correction ( loops ) 2 .",
    "non - gaussianity is related to the time derivative of the mode function . +",
    "therefore it goes like : almost zero(tree - level ) + a not so small correction(loops ) compared to zero    therefore the real treasure is hidden in the higher order correlation functions not in the power spectrum .",
    "we also showed that this would imply a huge(@xmath54 times bigger than tree - level prediction ) non - gaussianity @xmath59 parameter , leading to an immediately contradiction with the constraints on observed value of @xmath59 parameter .",
    "one can imagine scenarios where a spectator field causing a similar effect which might cancel the @xmath10 loops .",
    "another possibility is summing the whole perturbative series which was done by starobinsky & yokoyoma for self interacting scalar fields and tsamis & woodard for sqed .",
    "then investigate the consequences of the non - perturbative result . or",
    "one can simply say that it is the third assumption that is wrong and maybe it is so .",
    "but no matter what the solution is , quantum loop corrections that result into time - dependent scalar mode functions have consequences that are so important and will be of such magnitude that they can not be swept under the rug ."
