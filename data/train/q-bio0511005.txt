    "metabolic fluxes and intermediary metabolite concentrations are the essential currency of intracellular metabolism .",
    "the fluxes  or rates of turnover of the various reactions  determine the rate of production of required end products of a metabolic system , i.e. , atp synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation and lactate production via glycolysis .",
    "the intermediary metabolite concentrations are often key regulators in metabolic control . for example",
    ", fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is an allosteric regulator of pyruvate kinase @xcite .",
    "one of the primary examples of futile cycles in metabolism is fructose-6-phosphate phosphorylation dephosphorylation , an extensively studied metabolic regulatory module @xcite . in the present work , we study the quantitative relationship between a metabolic flux and the concentrations of its intermediary metabolites .",
    "in particular , we study the sensitivity of the intermediate concentration with respective to changes in the flux . depending on the biological context",
    ", the sensitivity may be high for some metabolites ( sensitive ) while for others it may be low ( robust ) .",
    "we show that the sensitivity is intimately related to the energetics , i.e. effective equilibrium constant , between the intermediate and the upstream substrate(s ) .",
    "hence control of sensitivity has a thermodynamic interpretation .",
    "the chemical equilibrium constant is an intrinsic property for a given chemical reaction and can not be altered by enzyme activity .",
    "however , the effective equilibrium constant operating in a reaction in a network can be shifted via a futile cycle , as we describe below .",
    "this same idea is behind the concept of kinetic proofreading , in which a kinetic cycle involving gtp hydrolysis increases the effective binding affinity between a codon and its trna , improving the accuracy of protein biosynthesis @xcite . at a deeper level",
    ", the kinetic proofread shares a same principle of nonequilibrium physics as the nuclear overhauser effect in magnetic resonance and catalytic wheel @xcite .",
    "the idea that futile cycles contribute to the regulation of metabolic functions has a long history @xcite .",
    "in particular , newsholme and crabtree suggested that futile cycling may be important for effective regulation at low metabolic fluxes , allowing a pathway to be controlled with much smaller excursions in the concentrations of the allosteric regulators .",
    "however , there has not been a systematic mathematical theory substantiating this idea . because of the lack of quantitative predictions , experimental verification of this important idea has been difficult .",
    "the present analysis provides strong support and a mechanistic quantification of the hypothesis of newsholme & crabtree on the biochemical function of futile cycles in metabolic systems @xcite .",
    "the analysis focuses on the quantitative relation between the energy expenditure , thermodynamics , and biochemical control .",
    "consider a simple linear metabolic pathway with species @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 : @xmath3 in which the concentration of the substrate , @xmath4 , is fixed .",
    "the constants @xmath5 are either the mass - action rate constants for first - order chemical kinetics or the effective rate constants acting around a steady - state .",
    "( see appendix a for a detailed analysis . )",
    "note that in a metabolic network , there are different ways of maintaining the input substrate concentration .",
    "two extreme cases are concentration clamping and constant flux injection @xcite .",
    "while concentration clamping can be achieved experimentally with a large pool or buffer for the substrate , flux injection is closely related to the `` flux - generating step '' suggested in @xcite .",
    "both concentration clamping and flux injection provide thermochemical driving forces for open biochemical systems , analogous to batteries in electrical circuits .",
    "recall that there are two types of ideal batteries , those that provides constant voltage ( voltage sources with zero internal resistance ) and those that provides constant current ( current sources with zero internal conductance ) .",
    "a real battery of course has a finite internal resistance and conductance .",
    "metabolic concentration and flux play equally important roles in the steady - state of a biochemical system .",
    "they should be treated on equal footing in a complete theory of metabolic dynamics . under an ideal setting",
    ", one can control the concentration(s ) and let the fluxes change in response ; similarly , one can control the flux(s ) and let the concentrations change in response .",
    "controlling fluxes can , but not necessarily , be accomplished by changing enzyme activities .",
    "significant controversies exist in the literature on systems analysis of metabolic networks due to differences in implicit assumptions on how a system is sustained in a nonequilibrium steady - state .",
    "in other words , how a system s steady - state responses to perturbations depends on how the steady - state is maintained .",
    "see @xcite for an interesting case study .",
    "it is worth pointing out that almost all the existing work on metabolic control analysis ( mca ) implicitly assumes concentration clamping @xcite .",
    "in fact , we recently discovered that for systems driven by flux injections , the summation of flux control coefficients equals zero rather than unity ( manuscript in preparation ) .",
    "naturally , the realistic situation in a cell is likely to be mixed .    in standard mca",
    ", one defines a flux control coefficient as the sensitivity of a flux @xmath6 to an enzyme concentration @xcite .",
    "this work , however , focuses on a different aspect of network control : the steady - state sensitivity of the concentrations of the intermediates , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , to the flux @xmath6 , at fixed enzyme activities .",
    "this stoichiometric sensitivity is also different from the elasticity coefficient , which is a property of a single enzyme ",
    "an elasticity coefficient ( also called local @xcite or intrinsic @xcite , or immediate @xcite control coefficient ) is determined from the rate law of a single enzymatic reaction in isolation .",
    "our stoichiometric sensitivity is related to the co - response coefficients introduced by rohwer and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the co - response coefficient emphasizes the concomitantly changes in a flux and a concentration in response to a perturbation in a given enzyme .",
    "while changing enzyme is one of the possible means to perturb kinetics , there are other means to perturb a flux . hence the stoichiometric sensitivity is a more general kinetic concept than the co - response coefficient in mca . in fact , the present analysis focuses on sensitivity of network concentrations to steady - state network fluxes . even though both metabolites and enzymes are chemical species in a biochemical reaction system , their roles in metabolic kinetics and thermodynamics are very different .",
    "a change in the enzyme amounts to a change in both forward and backward effective rate constants for the catalyzed reaction without altering their ratio ( haldane s equation ) .    with given @xmath4 and @xmath6 as input and output in a steady - state , the intermediate concentrations in the reaction of eq .",

    "the gibbs free energies of the metabolites , @xmath16 , decreases along the pathway following the direction of the flux . as we shall see , this correlation between the sensitivity and energetics is not just a coincidence .",
    "the sensivity @xmath17 can also be expressed as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the backward flux from state 1 to state 0 , and the net flux @xmath6 is equal to the foward flux minus the backward flux @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 is an elegant result that was known to newsholm and crabtree @xcite .",
    "the flux ratio is a measure of whether a reaction operates near equilibrium ( @xmath22 ) or far from equilibrium ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the expression @xmath24 applies to an intermediate at an arbitrary position in the reaction sequence when all the upstream reactions are in rapid equilibrium .",
    "for example , if @xmath25 , then the reaction between state 0 and state 1 is maintained near equilibrium , and @xmath26 for the reaction between state 1 and state 2 .",
    "quantities such as @xmath27 have been discussed in the context of allosteric regulation , by a metabolite @xmath28 , of some enzyme which in turn regulates the @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "brand and his coworkers have extensively used an empirical , `` top - down '' elasticity analysis in assessing the fractional changes in the fluxes of metabolic reactions in response to a change in the concentration of an effector @xcite .",

'' and ( _ ii _ ) `` why are these two mechanisms , i.e. , noncovalent allosteric regulation and covalent modification via phosphorylation , usually superimposed on one another even though the changes in conformation resulting in either activation or inhibition are essentially the same ? ''    the essential difference between the binding mechanism and a futile cycle is that reversible binding does not expend energy .",
    "yet there are important tradeoffs associated with macromolecular binding .",
    "specifically , buffering control by macromolecular binding requires the effectors , say a protein , to be present in an amount approximately equal to that of the metabolite .",
    "the acting principle here is that significant binding is necessary to achieve a significant shift in the effective equilibrium .",
    "the futile cycle approach requires only a relatively small amount of enzyme to catalyze the cyclic reactions . from a control systems perspective , if feedback information is tied to the concentration of some protein , then the former approach is ideal . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is necessary to achieve signal amplification where only a small number of copies of a protein are activated , a phosphorylation - dephosphorylation futile cycle is appropriate for the task .",
    "in addition , the costs of binding regulation and the futile cycles regulation are different .",
    "the former requires significant amount of biosynthesis of effectors in advance , while the latter requires only a small amount of enzymes for the hydrolysis reaction .",
    "the latter consumes energy during the regulation while the former pays in advance in the biosynthesis . in engineering terms , this is an issue of material cost versus energy utilization , an issue of overhead versus operational costs .",
    "the present work suggests an important relation between the regulatory sensitivity and robustness of metabolic systems in cell and the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions .",
    "this rather unexpected quantitative relationship deserves further investigation , especially from a systems biology perspective . in this section ,",
    "we provide some initial discussions for the subject .",
    "all chemical reactions are reversible , although in some cases the backward rate may be negligibly small .",
    "approximating such cases as irreversible is often acceptable in kinetic analysis , but is problematic for a thermodynamic analysis as illustrated in @xcite . in the biochemical literature",

    "rigorously , the concentrations ( such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) discussed so far represent the mean values of the concentrations of these species .",

    "in addition to affecting sensitivity , it is possible that futile cycles play an important role in generating heart and regulating temperature @xcite .",
