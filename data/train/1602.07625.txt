    "the study of interconnected natural systems as complex networks has uncovered common principles of organisation across scientific domains .",
    "two pervasive features are ( @xmath0 ) the grouping of the nodes into modules and ( @xmath1 ) the presence of highly connected nodes or hubs .",
    "it was soon recognised that these two features are signatures of hierarchical organisation but attempts to incorporate both into realistic network models have been of limited success .",
    "currently , the most popular hierarchical models recursively divide modules into smaller modules  @xcite .",
    "these networks , however , lack of hubs . investigation of the brain s connectivity has shed light on how nature efficiently combines the two features .",
    "real connectomes are modular with the cross - modular connections centralised through highly connected brain regions which form a rich - club  @xcite .",
    "the nervous system acquires information about the environment through different channels , known as sensory modalities .",
    "information from each channel is independently processed by specialised neural compartments .",
    "an adequate and efficient integration of the information of those different channels is necessary for survival  @xcite . in a series of numerical experiments , tononi and",
    "sporns attempted to identify the right topologies that help optimally balance the coexistence of both segregated subsystems and an efficient integration of their information .",
    "@xcite . starting from an ensemble of random graphs , an evolutionary algorithm would select those networks with the largest complexity . in subsequent iterations the winners would be mutated ",
    "slightly rewired  to produce another population to start over .",
    "the underlying assumption was that an increase of the _ neural complexity _ defined by the authors would lead to networks with balanced capacity to integrate and segregate information  @xcite .",
    "this procedure gave rise to networks with interconnected communities capturing the relevance of modules for the segregation of information .",
    "however , the optimised networks lacked of hubs and rich - clubs .",
    "dynamical models on modular networks have shown that there is a balanced rate in the number of inter- to intra - modular links that optimises the complexity of the network dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has also been observed in contagion spreading , where the contagion threshold depends on the node s degree  @xcite .",
    "too few links between the communities leads to clustered ( segregated ) dynamics but no efficient interaction between them . on the contrary",
    ", too many connections between communities easily leads to a globally synchronised network meaning there is integration but no dynamical segregation .",
    "a balance is achieved in between .",
    "however , it can be argued that in modular networks integration is not efficient because it happens via global synchrony , which is an undesirable state of neural networks .    despite these and other past efforts",
    ", the relation between a network s complexity and its capacity to segregate and integrate information is yet unresolved and confusing .",
    "in particular , their causal relation requires clarification . while it seems plausible to assume that the needs of neural systems to integrate and segregate information may have led to the development of complex topological features , e.g. , modules and rich - clubs , the opposite is not necessarily true . a network optimised for high complexity does not necessarily end developing modules and hubs , nor being good for integrating and segregating information .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to test and corroborate this causal relation only in one direction , namely , that the hierarchical centralisation of cross - modular connections through rich - clubs leads to enhanced functional complexity . for that purpose",
    "we consider both real neural connectomes and synthetic network models .",
    "we study the evolution of their functional complexity as the networks undergo a transition towards global synchrony by gradually increasing the weights of the links .",
    "we find that functional complexity emerges for intermediate values of the tuning parameter ; when the nodes are neither independent from each other nor globally synchronised .    by comparing the real networks to randomised versions in which either the presence of hubs or the modular structure are destroyed",
    ", we find that both topological features are crucial ingredients for the networks to achieve high functional complexity . in the randomised networks complexity",
    "is always reduced . to clarify the precise impact of rich - clubs we have also carried out a lesion study .",
    "selective removal of the links between the hubs leads to a reduction of functional complexity in all cases .",
    "the reduction is significant compared to random lesions . in the case of the human dataset we also observe that the dynamics of the brain , at rest , reflects a state with the largest complexity that its anatomical connectome can host .",
    "last , we introduce a new model of hierarchical networks inspired on the topology of neural and brain networks .",
    "our hierarchical network model successfully combines nested modules with the presence of hubs .",
    "this is achieved by centralising the inter - modular connectivity through a few nodes by a preferential attachment rule .",
    "these networks achieve higher complexity than other well - known benchmark models .",
    "the manuscript is organised as follows .",
    "first we introduce a measure of functional complexity that is based on the variability of the pair - wise cross - correlations of the nodes .",
    "we then investigate the complexity of neural networks in comparison to surrogate networks .",
    "finally we compare the complexity of common random and hierarchical network models and we introduce the new model of modular and hierarchical networks with centralised inter - modular connectivity .",
    "despite the common use of the term `` complex networks '' a formal quantitative measure is missing to determine how complex a network is . here",
    "we take an indirect approach and estimate the complexity of the collective dynamics that the network can host . in general ,",
    "the complexity of a coupled dynamical system is a combination of the temporal complexity of the signals traced by the individual nodes and of the spatial formation of clusters .",
    "because we are here interested on the influence of the network s topology and because the temporal complexity depends on the model chosen for the node dynamics , we study the spatial aspect of complexity .",
    "we refer to this as _ functional complexity _ for consistency with the term _ functional connectivity _ to denote the time - averaged dynamical interdependencies between neural populations .    given a network of @xmath2 coupled dynamical nodes , e.g. neurones , cortical regions or oscillators , its pair - wise correlation matrix @xmath3 reflects the degree of interdependencies among the nodes .",
    "when the nodes are disconnected from each other , they are also dynamically independent and hence , no complex collective dynamics emerge .",
    "all correlation values are @xmath4 , fig .",
    "[ fig : complexity](top ) . in the opposite extreme ,",
    "when the nodes are strongly coupled , the network becomes synchronised .",
    "however , global synchrony is neither a complex state because all nodes follow the same behaviour . in this case",
    "all the correlation values are @xmath5 , fig .",
    "[ fig : complexity](bottom ) .",
    "complexity emerges when the collective dynamics are characterised by intermediate states , between independence and global synchrony .",
    "such states are reflected by a broad distribution of @xmath6 values , fig .",
    "[ fig : complexity](middle ) .     or to @xmath7 .",
    "complex dynamical interactions happen when the collective behaviour is characterised by intermediate states leading to a broad distribution of the correlation values ( middle panel ) .",
    "red lines correspond to the uniform distribution , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of bins .",
    ", width=313 ]    at the two extreme cases , independence and global synchrony , the distribution @xmath10 of pair - wise correlations is characterised by a narrow distribution . in between , at the range in which the network dynamics are more complex",
    ", the distribution becomes broader .",
    "after these observations we define the _ functional complexity _ @xmath11 of the network as the variability of @xmath10 .",
    "now , there are different manners to evaluate the variance of a distribution .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , complexity was defined as the normed entropy of @xmath10 . here , we choose to define complexity as the difference between the observed distribution @xmath10 and the uniform distribution .",
    "if @xmath10 is estimated in @xmath9 bins , the uniform distribution is @xmath12 for all bins @xmath13 .",
    "hence , functional complexity is quantified as the integral between the two distributions , which is replaced by the sum of their differences over the bins : @xmath14 where @xmath15 means the absolute value and @xmath16 is a normalisation factor that represents the extreme case in which the @xmath10 is a dirac - delta function @xmath17 .",
    "that is , when all @xmath6 values fall in the same bin as it happens when the nodes are either mutually independent or globally synchronised . because we are only interested in the pair - wise interactions we discard the diagonal entries @xmath18 from the calculations .    after comparing different alternatives to quantify @xmath11 we found that the measure in eq .",
    "( [ eq : complexity ] ) to be the most convenient solution ; see supplementary information .",
    "this choice turned to be the most sensitive to discriminate between network topologies and also the most robust to variation in the number of bins .",
    "the reason is that the integral does not simply evaluate the broadness of the distribution but , more generally , its divergence from uniformity .",
    "this measure of functional complexity is easy to apply to empirical and to simulated data .",
    "while in this paper we study cross - correlations , the measure can be applied to any other metric of pair - wise functional connectivity , e.g. mutual information .",
    "in this section we investigate the functional complexity of anatomical brain and neural connectomes .",
    "we study the binary corticocortical connectivities of cats , macaque monkeys and humans , and also the neuronal wiring of the _ c. elegans _ ( see materials and methods )",
    ". we will refer to these as the structural connectivities ( sc ) and we will denote their corresponding correlation matrices @xmath3 as their functional connectivities ( fc ) .",
    "for each sc network we study the evolution of its fc as the collective dynamics undergo a transition from independence to global synchrony .",
    "this transition is controlled by increasing the weights , or coupling strength @xmath19 , of the sc links .",
    "we compare the results to two types of surrogate networks : ( @xmath0 ) rewired networks that conserve the degree distribution and ( @xmath1 ) random modular networks which preserve the community structure of the original network , see materials and methods . in the rewired networks the hubs are still present although the modular structure vanishes .",
    "the modularity preserving random networks conserve the number of links within and across modules but alter the degree distribution and the hubs disappear . for completeness , we also compare the results to those of random graphs with the same size and number of links .",
    "all results for surrogate networks are averages over @xmath20 realisations . in order to quantify more precisely the impact of the rich - club",
    ", we also include a lesion study .",
    "after selective removal of the links between the rich - club hubs functional complexity is reduced .",
    "this reduction is compared to ensembles of randomly lesioned networks .        to evaluate the functional complexity of the sc matrices we first need to estimate their fc matrices at different values of the coupling strength , @xmath19 .",
    "because we want to emphasise the contribution of the network s topology on the dynamics it can host we need to discard , as much as possible , other sources of influence on the network dynamics .",
    "for this reason we introduce a heuristic mapping to analytically estimate the correlation matrices @xmath3 out of the @xmath21 without the need to run detailed simulations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cov ] ) and  ( [ eq : qexp ] ) . see details in materials and methods",
    "assuming the network consists of a set of coupled gaussian noise sources the time - averaged cross - correlation matrix @xmath3 of the system can be analytically estimated out of the structural connectivity matrix  @xcite . in this framework",
    "the correlation between brain regions can be understood as the total _ influence _ exerted by one region over another , accumulated over all possible paths of all lengths within the network .",
    "the coupling ( the weight of the links ) , serves as a resolution parameter determining the range of correlations .",
    "when @xmath19 is weak perturbations quickly decay allowing only for local correlations between neighbouring nodes . as the coupling grows the range of the correlations gradually increases . for strong coupling ,",
    "perturbations propagate along the whole network causing global correlations .",
    "an unrealistic property of the gaussian diffusion model is that the system leads to divergent dynamics at strong couplings .",
    "motivated by the fact that in neural systems the signals attenuate , that is , information fed into the network rapidly disappears or is transformed instead of perpetually propagate along the network , we solve the divergence problem introducing an exponential decay for the diffusion of the signals over longer paths .",
    "this exponential decay guarantees that , once the network is globally correlated , an increase in coupling has no influence and the system does not diverge .",
    "this property is shared by widely applied models for generic oscillatory and neural dynamics , e.g. , kuramoto oscillators and neural - mass models .",
    "simulations performed with those models show the same qualitative behaviour as our exponential mapping ; see supplementary information .",
    "the results for the neural and brain connectomes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : realnets ] . as expected",
    ", @xmath11 vanishes at the extremes , when @xmath22 and when @xmath19 is large enough for the networks to globally synchronise . complexity emerges at intermediate levels of @xmath19 .",
    "find sample correlation matrices in supplementary figure  s1 .",
    "all real networks ( solid red lines ) achieve larger complexity than the surrogates along the whole range of @xmath19 .",
    "the bar plots summarise the peak values .",
    "the lowest peak corresponds always to the random graphs ( dotted lines ) while the rewired ( solid gray lines ) and the modularity preserving ( dashed lines ) networks take intermediate complexities .",
    "these results show that it is the combination of hubs and modular structure what allows the real networks to reach larger functional complexities . destroying one of these features",
    ", either the hubs ( by randomising the networks to conserve only their modularity ) or the modular structure ( by rewiring links to conserve only the degrees ) , leads to a notable reduction in complexity .",
    "another observation is that the transition to synchrony of the real networks is slower than that of the surrogates .",
    "this shows that there is a wide range of @xmath19 for which the complexity remains high .",
    "since the rewiring procedure does not necessarily disconnect the hubs from each other , it remains unclear what is the precise impact of the rich - club itself on the complexity .",
    "how is complexity altered when the hubs are disconnected from each other ? in order to investigate this in more detail we have performed a lesioning study .",
    "first , we have identified the rich - clubs on each of the four empirical networks , see supplementary information , and then we have selectively removed all the links between the rich - club hubs .",
    "these comprise only a small fraction of the total number of links and thus small , but measurable changes in complexity are expected . after selective removal of the rich - club links from the sc matrices ,",
    "their corresponding fc matrices were computed for the optimal @xmath19 at which the complexity @xmath23 of the original networks were maximal .",
    "we find that , compared to the original networks , the functional complexity @xmath24 in the lesioned networks decreases in all the four cases .",
    "see table  [ tab : lesions ] .    .",
    "* selective lesion of rich - club links : * summary of results for the lesion study",
    ". selective lesion of all rich - club links leads to a decrease in functional complexity @xmath24 compared to the complexity of the original network @xmath23 .",
    "after comparison to equivalent random lesions , the probability of finding a lesioned network with complexity lower than @xmath24 is null for the _ c. elegans _ and the macaque connectomes , and significantly small for the cat .",
    "[ tab : lesions ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         for comparison we include also the ensemble average @xmath25-density curves for three null - models , the same used in the comparisons of complexity : ( @xmath0 ) rewired networks conserving the degree of the nodes , ( @xmath1 ) random graphs of same size and number of links as the network , and ( @xmath26 ) random networks with the same modular structure as the original network ( see materials and methods section in the main text ) . as expected ,",
    "the rewired networks ( dashed lines ) follow closely the @xmath25-density of the real networks . at the largest degrees ,",
    "however , the real networks still achieve the largest values . in the case of the macaque and the human tractography",
    "this relationship is the closest implying that the presence of the rich - club might be `` explained '' by their degree distribution alone .",
    "random networks ( dotted lines ) and modularity preserving random networks ( dash - dotted lines ) also tend to increase @xmath27 although significantly slower than the real and the rewired networks .",
    "they only reach maximal densities slightly above the initial @xmath28 .",
    "the early cut - off is because the degree distribution of random graphs is a poissonian distribution with all nodes having degree comparable to the mean .",
    "the neural and brain networks , however have a broad degree distribution with largest degrees above the expectation in random graphs .",
