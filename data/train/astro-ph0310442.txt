    "our galaxy s central supermassive black hole provides an unprecedented opportunity for studying the accretion physics of these objects , which are thought to power active galactic nuclei .",
    "since we must view the galactic center ( gc ) through a large column of gas and dust , observations are restricted to wavelengths in and longer than the near infrared ( nir ) and to x - rays harder than about 2  kev .    near infrared observations",
    "reveal a dense stellar cluster ( genzel et al .",
    "2003a , and references therein ) , whose inner members have high proper motions , consistent with the presence of a black hole of mass @xmath4 ( schdel et al . 2002 ; ghez et al . 2003a ) . its location , as derived from stellar orbits , coincides with the compact , nonthermal , weakly variable , linearly and circularly polarized radio source sgr  a@xmath0(balick & brown 1974 ; bower et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) and a flaring x - ray point source discovered by the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ ( baganoff et al . 2001 ; 2003 , hereafter b01 and b03 , respectively ) .",
    "the x - ray emission from this source is extended on scales comparable to the bondi radius , @xmath5  pc .",
    "recently a flaring nir source has been detected at this position ( genzel et al .",
    "2003b ; ghez et al .",
    "2003c ) .",
    "the spatial and spectral structure of the x - ray emission may help to constrain the diverse set of theoretical models that have been proposed for the accretion onto the black hole ( e.g. , falcke , & markoff 2000 ; melia , liu , & coker 2000 ; liu & melia 2002 ; quataert 2002 ; yuan , markoff , & falcke 2002 ; yuan , quataert , & narayan 2003 ; quataert 2003 ) .",
    "it has been argued that the low luminosity of sgr  a@xmath0with respect to its expected classical bondi accretion luminosity is evidence for very inefficient accretion mechanisms ( e.g. narayan 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "models that attempt to explain the arcsecond scale diffuse emission via accretion onto a clustered population of unresolved neutron stars have also been proposed ( pessah & melia 2003 ) .",
    "nayakshin & sunyaev ( 2003 ) proposed that the x - ray flares may result from the interaction of stars with a cold gas disk orbiting close to sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "in this paper we consider the scattering and absorption of x - rays from the galactic center .",
    "in particular we emphasize the importance of scattering in producing extended emission  `` halos ''  on _ arcsecond _ scales .",
    "since much of the intervening dust is located close to the gc , these halos are much more concentrated than those around sources observed along more typical galactic lines of sight .",
    "we assess the contribution made by the concentrated scattering halos of galactic center sources to the diffuse emission seen within @xmath1 of sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "the halos are so concentrated that they can dominate the intensity of the chandra point spread function ( psf ) inside 1 , so they affect determinations of the point source flux and thus intrinsic luminosity .",
    "they also affect the estimates of the intensity of emission due to diffuse gas close to the bondi radius , and thus estimates of the gas density and the black hole s bondi accretion rate .",
    "we consider the distribution of gas and dust towards the galactic center in ",
    "[ s : gas ] .",
    "we then use x - ray observations and a model for how dust and gas absorb and scatter x - rays to calculate the intrinsic x - ray luminosity and spectrum of sgr  a@xmath0([s : spec ] ) .",
    "this involves a correction for dust scattering that requires a calculation of the angular intensity profiles of scattering halos as a function of energy . in ",
    "[ s : halo ] we calculate the total intensity of the scattering halo , including examples of the delayed halos from flares , and compare to observations .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results and conclude in  [ s : con ] .",
    "to calculate x - ray scattering we require a model for the spatial distribution of dust along the midplane of the galaxy from the sun to the galactic center .",
    "the total column of gas and dust also affects the amount of absorption .",
    "we take the distance from the sun to the galactic center to be 8  kpc ( reid 1993 ) .",
    "we assume a uniform metallicity and dust - to - gas ratio , taken to be 1.5 times the value for the local ism , consistent with galactic abundance gradients measured in regions ( giveon , morisset , & sternberg 2002 ) .      based on studies of the radial distribution of the atomic and molecular gas ( e.g. binney & merrifield 1998 , fig .",
    "9.19 ) we approximate the distribution of gas from the main galactic disk via a gaussian located at @xmath6  kpc and with a hwhm of 2  kpc .",
    "we denote the fraction of the total column that is in this outer component by @xmath7 .",
    "this approximation underestimates the local ism density close to the sun , but this material makes little contribution to inner x - ray scattering halos , on scales of arcseconds .",
    "a second component of the total column is the material in the inner few hundred parsecs of the galaxy , and we denote the fraction of material in this region by @xmath8 .",
    "the properties of this gas have been constrained by data from iras ( _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ) and cobe ( _ cosmic background explorer _ ) observations ( launhardt , zylka , & mezger 2002 ) . a gas disk with typical densities in its diffuse component of @xmath9",
    "is inferred to extend out to @xmath10 .",
    "an inner , denser , inclined , circumnuclear disk is seen as a separate dynamical component ( gsten et al .",
    "1987 ; marr , wright , & backer 1993 ) extending from @xmath11 . however , most of this material does not intersect our line of sight to sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "the distribution of gas in these regions is very inhomogeneous : within the @xmath12 parsec disk are giant molecular clouds , such as the `` 50  km / s cloud '' and the `` 20  km / s cloud '' , which lie close to the line of sight to sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "vollmer , zylka , & duschl ( 2003 ) estimate that the former is @xmath13 closer to us than sgr  a@xmath0 , while the latter is spread out over a larger distance with its densest region @xmath14 closer than sgr  a@xmath0 . the centroids of these clouds are within @xmath15 of our sgr  a@xmath0sight line .",
    "there is also evidence for clumps of hot molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk on scales @xmath16 ( mcgary , coil , & ho 2001 ) , and even inside the central parsec ( herrnstein & ho 2002 ) , so that the total gas column to a particular location in the central region may show significant variation . in the study of herrnstein & ho ( 2002 ) structure was seen on scales all the way down to the beam size of 10@xmath17 .    as a first attempt to describe this complicated density structure , we shall approximate the radial distribution of the inner component with a gaussian centered at various distances , @xmath18 , towards us from sgr  a@xmath0 , and with a hwhm equal to @xmath18 . as a fiducial case we take @xmath19  pc , but we also consider models with @xmath20 and 25  pc . in all cases",
    "we assume a small central cavity that is free of dust .",
    "we take the radius of this cavity to be 2  pc , and then adjust the normalizations of the gaussians so that the total column from 2  pc to 8  kpc is equal to the adopted overall totals .",
    "individual gas clumps and clouds may have a column density comparable with the total through the more diffuse regions ( below ) . to allow for the possibility of such an enhancement we consider models with a range of column densities in the smoothly distributed component .",
    "the total columns of gas and dust to the gc are uncertain .",
    "one of the most common methods used to measure these quantities is by estimation of the k band extinction by simultaneously fitting near - ir photometry of gc stars with spectra of a particular stellar type and with a certain amount of reddening ( becklin et al .",
    "1978 ; lebofsky , rieke , & tokunaga 1982 ; sellgren et al . 1987 ; rieke , rieke , & paul 1989 , hereafter rrp ) .",
    "this method requires knowledge of the extinction law in the near - ir ( e.g. rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) and accurate models for the intrinsic stellar spectra .",
    "the main discriminant for the stellar spectra are the strengths of the co absorption bands : they become stronger for decreasing temperature and increasing luminosity . @xmath21",
    "absorption at the edges of the k  band can help distinguish between m giants and k supergiants , because the strength of this absorption decreases with increasing luminosity .",
    "typically , solar metallicity stars have been used as standards for late - type spectra ( e.g. kleinmann & hall 1986 ) .",
    "one possible source of systematic error is the effect of elevated metallicities , which would tend to increase the strength of the co and @xmath22 features for a given luminosity and surface temperature .",
    "an alternative to fitting detailed stellar spectra is to assume that certain , particularly blue , sources have rayleigh - jeans spectra : this method was used by rrp for the sources making up the irs16 complex , which have subsequently been identified as hot , emission line stars ( e.g. eckart et al .",
    "1995 ; krabbe et al . 1995",
    "; these observations also show that irs13 , discussed below , is a complex dominated by hot he  @xmath23 stars ) , however the derived dust columns are still somewhat sensitive to the choice of extinction law ( see below ) .",
    "a third method to measure extinction is from the ratio of br@xmath24 to br@xmath25 recombination lines .",
    "the difficulties here are ( 1 ) the need to assume a particular theoretical ratio for the intrinsic line ratio , e.g. based on case b recombination theory at a particular density and temperature , and ( 2 ) the measurement of the line ratios in what is a very complicated and crowded region of the sky .",
    "the relatively bright infra - red sources closest to sgr  a@xmath0are the irs16 complex , irs13 , and irs7 , which have projected separations from sgr  a@xmath0of @xmath26 , 0.13 , and 0.20  pc .",
    "the values of @xmath27 adopted by rrp for these sources were 3.4 , 3.5 , 4.1 , respectively , where the value for irs16 is an average of the 7 components reported by rrp .",
    "the extinction law used by rrp has @xmath28 between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "the milky way dust models of weingartner & draine ( 2001 , hereafter wd01 ) with @xmath32 have @xmath33 .",
    "if the extinction at k is derived from the degree of reddening of a rayleigh - jeans spectrum , then the values of @xmath27 derived from wd01 models are @xmath34 times that derived by rrp .",
    "similar corrections may be expected for determinations of @xmath27 from fitting more realistic stellar spectra .",
    "draine ( 2003a ) has discussed the extinction per h nucleon in regions of different @xmath35 .",
    "using @xmath36 from draine ( 2003a ) and the grain size distributions of wd01 , we find @xmath37 . in the fiducial ,",
    "`` local milky way metallicity '' case of the wd01 model with @xmath38 the effective h column densities for the three gc sources described above are thus @xmath39 . for the models with @xmath40 the column densities are different by factors of 1.09 and 0.92 , respectively .",
    "if the effective metallicity is greater than solar by a certain factor , then these estimates would be reduced by the same factor , assuming a constant dust to metals ratio and for fixed grain properties .",
    "stars such as s0 - 2 , which are very close to sgr  a@xmath0 in both the plane of the sky and in line of sight dimension , are much fainter than the brighter ir sources discussed above , so the continuum slopes of their published spectra ( ghez et al .",
    "2003b ) are not yet reliably determined ( a. ghez 2003 , private communication ) . with this caveat in mind",
    ", the k band extinction can be estimated assuming an intrinsic rayleigh - jeans spectrum ( which is a reasonable assumption ) and assuming a k band continuum spectrum @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "these values yield @xmath43 for the rrp normalization , about 50% greater than the value estimated using the same technique towards irs16 .",
    "the above range of values for the extinction appear to be fairly typical of the gc region on larger scales .",
    "using the same reddening law as rrp , figer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find @xmath44 towards the quintuplet star cluster , located 30  pc in projection from sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "lebofsky & rieke ( 1987 ) found the extinction over a 24 square arcminute region around the gc was spatially variable , but never less than @xmath45 .",
    "sellgren et al .",
    "( 1987 ) ( using @xmath46 so that values of @xmath27 are about a factor of 0.85 of those derived using @xmath31 of rrp ) reported that their extinction results were consistent with a uniform component with @xmath47 and a variable component due to material near the gc with @xmath48 .",
    "these results are consistent with the recent model of launhardt et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who find @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) due to dust in the outer galactic disk and a similar value for extinction due to dust in the gc region itself .",
    "we note that the clumps reported by herrnstein & ho ( 2002 ) are estimated ( but with large uncertainties ) to have @xmath51 , which would correspond to extinctions a factor of @xmath5230 larger than typically reported , if they contain typical dust grain populations .",
    "as we shall describe later , estimates of the total column density have also been made by fitting models for the x - ray emission from sgr  a@xmath0to observations .",
    "porquet et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found @xmath53 , corresponding to @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "b01 found @xmath56 , i.e. about a factor of 3 or 4 smaller than porquet et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "given the uncertainties in the estimates of the total gas and dust columns along the line of sight to the gc , and since it is clear that there is some variation towards different objects in this region , we shall consider a range of different density distributions and total column densities . as an average for the gas along the line of sight to the gc",
    ", we adopt a metallicity of 1.5 times solar and a dust - to - gas mass ratio of 1.5 times the local interstellar value , which is taken to be 0.008 .",
    "this metallicity enhancement is consistent with iso ( _ infrared space observatory _ )",
    "observations of galactic regions ( giveon , morisset , & sternberg 2002 ) .",
    "we assume depletions into dust grains of 67% for c , 20% for o , 90% for mg , si , and fe , and 0% for n , ne , and s ( wd01 ) .",

    ", the dust model appears to be able to reproduce observed extinction curves in various galactic regions , and in the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "this dust model , when illuminated by starlight , produces infrared emission consistent with the observed emission spectrum of the interstellar medium ( li & draine 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "for the amorphous silicate grains and the carbonaceous grains we employed the dielectric functions recently estimated by draine ( 2003b ) and calculated the scattering using mie theory .",
    "the x - ray absorption and scattering properties of this model are consistent with observations towards nova cygni 1992 that probe typical dust in the local diffuse ism ( draine & tan 2003 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : tau ] we show the energy dependence of the optical depth ( due to photoelectric absorption by gas and extinction by dust ) of our models of gas and dust toward the gc .",
    "the contribution of the dust extinction due to scattering is also shown .",
    "lutz et al . ( 1996 ) reported extinction towards the gc in the 4 - 8  @xmath67 region of the spectrum exceeding that expected for standard graphite - silicate mixes ( e.g. draine 1989 ) , which may indicate that additional species are present , such as iron / metal sulphides or metal oxides , or carriers related to the production of the 3  @xmath67 ` ice ' absorption features that are seen in the spectra . from an analysis of such absorption features , chiar et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found evidence for enhanced molecular material along the line of sight to sgr  a@xmath0as compared to the quintuplet star cluster .",
    "a shift in the grain size distribution toward larger grains , with increased values of @xmath35 , is expected in the dense , cold conditions of the cores of giant molecular clouds .",
    "since these conditions may apply to a significant amount of the gas and dust towards sgr  a@xmath0 , we shall also consider the effect of using models with @xmath68 for the entire dust column .",
    "dust models with larger grains yield lower values of @xmath61 for a given @xmath27 and metallicity .",
    "for example , the @xmath68 model of wd01 gives columns that are a factor of 0.70 smaller than the @xmath38 case .    given an observed x - ray spectrum we can use the models shown in figure [ fig : tau ] to estimate the form of the intrinsic spectrum (  [ s : spec ] ) .",
    "however , we shall also see that when the flux from a particular source is defined as all photons arriving from within a certain angular radius ( e.g. on arcsecond scales for chandra ) , then a substantial fraction of the photons that are scattered can remain in this source region and must be accounted for .",
    "utilizing the high spatial resolution ( @xmath69 ) of _ chandra _ , b01 and b03 reported the first detection of an x - ray source that can be convincingly associated with sgr  a@xmath0 .",

    "however , these calculations did not account for dust scattering ( b01 ) , leading to an overestimation of the column density necessary to produce the observed soft x - ray cutoff .",
    "b01 reported results from a second observation with effective exposure time of 35.4  ks , which included a @xmath74  ks flare . from a joint analysis of the quiescent emission from the two epochs and the flare emission from the second epoch , b01 derived @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , where the subscripts @xmath78 and @xmath79 refer to the quiescent and flaring states , respectively . models of the spectra of an absorbed optically thin thermal plasma ( raymond & smith 1977 ) yielded similar column densities with @xmath80 ( b03 ) .",
    "systematic errors due to the energy dependence of the enclosed energy fraction inside 1.5@xmath70 and of charge transfer inefficiency effects could lead to an overestimation of @xmath81 by @xmath82 , an underestimation of the intrinsic x - ray luminosity by @xmath83 , and an overestimation of @xmath84 ( b03 ) .",
    "xmm - newton observed a bright 3  ks flare from sgr  a@xmath0(porquet et al .",
    "2003 ) and from these observations were derived @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "the spectrum could also be fit with models based on bremsstrahlung continuum , thermal blackbody , and optically thin plasma emission .",
    "the method of estimating the intrinsic spectrum of a source typically involves counting all the photons arriving inside a given circular area around a source ( a radius of @xmath87 was used for the chandra observations of the quiescent state ) , and then subtracting off a background flux , estimated from a surrounding annulus .",
    "given an assumed dust and gas column , a correction is then made to estimate the intrinsic flux that would be received if there was no absorption .",
    "however , for gas and dust distributed close to the source , much of the scattering halo is located very close to the psf , and needs to be accounted for .    consider a source observed at 4  kev .",

    "the halo profile was convolved with the on - axis energy - dependent chandra psf , derived from the ciao ( chandra interactive analysis of observations ) software .",
    "we see that the scattering halos can dominate over the psf inside 1 . in this figure",
    "we also show the dependence on the scattering halo on the grain size distribution , as parameterized via @xmath35 : a model with a larger value of @xmath35 , corresponding to larger average grain sizes , produces a halo that is more concentrated inside a few arcseconds .",
    "the halos at several different energies are compared in figure  [ fig : halo248 ] : at lower energies the halo intensities are stronger relative to the psf .",
    "the fraction of enclosed flux in the scattering halo , relative to that in the psf is shown in figure  [ fig : haloint ] .",
    "these results allow one to correct for the contribution that a scattering halo makes to the direct flux from a source , given the angular scale inside which the direct flux of a particular observation is estimated , i.e. the observed flux inside an angle @xmath93 is the sum of the unscattered flux and the part of the scattered flux that lies inside @xmath93 .    for absorption and scattering with our fiducial density models ,",

    "it is likely , although not certain (  [ s : gas ] ) , that their lines of sight are subject to similar extinctions , particularly for contributions from gas and dust that is @xmath106 towards us from the galactic center .",
    "we find that dust - scattering of point source emission is important for broadening the psf of chandra for typical sources in the vicinity of the gc .",
    "the level of enhancement is sufficient to explain the observed profiles of the sources near sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "the largest enhancement at the arcsecond scale occurs with the inner dust component about 50  pc from sgr  a@xmath0 , and with dust that has @xmath68 , i.e. larger grains .",
    "however , even with the model with the largest dust column , corresponding to @xmath60  magnitudes , the scattering halo appears to be insufficient to explain the intensity of the diffuse emission within a few arcseconds of sgr  a@xmath0by factors of several . the total dust column would have to be increased by similar factors above the value of the @xmath60 model in order to explain the entire diffuse emission as being due to dust - scattered emission from an unresolved , steady point source .",
    "we note that our model intensity profiles are greater than the data in the central annulus by about a factor of 1.8 .",
    "this is because we have normalized the models to produce the observed flux , which was estimated inside an extraction radius of @xmath87 .",
    "the models underpredict the intensity beyond about 0.6 , and so to compensate have larger central intensities .",
    "if there are instrumental effects that lead to broadening , such as pointing errors , that have not been corrected for in the data analysis of b03 , then these would cause the intensity of the central annulus to appear artificially smaller .",
    "if there are no such effects ( as suggested by the profiles of the two nearby point sources ) so that the observed intensity of the central annulus is accurate , then our point source models would have to be reduced in flux by a factor of about 1.8 .",
    "this would lead to a similar reduction in the halo intensities and the contribution they make to the extended emission .",
    "we now make a crude estimate for the contribution of the scattering halos from sources surrounding sgr  a@xmath0to the diffuse background inside 10 . from figure",
    "[ fig : haloint ] we estimate that at 4  kev for the @xmath60 model the scattering halo contributes about 20% of the psf flux at angles 1.5 - 10 .",
    "b03 report that the sources inside 10have a combined flux of @xmath107 .",
    "thus over the 40.9  ks of the observation , the number of expected counts per pixel ( 0.492 ) is about 0.1 .",
    "the @xmath57 model would predict about half of this value .",
    "these estimates are much smaller than the 1.2 counts per pixel measured by b03 for the strength of the diffuse background , so we conclude that the scattering halos from the innermost gc sources make a relatively minor contribution to the local diffuse emission .      an additional effect that can boost the observed intensity is the delayed scattering of enhanced flux from an earlier flare .",
    "b03 observed that the flux at the start of their observation was rapidly declining and three times greater than the mean value .",
    "they concluded that a flare occurred around the time of the start of their observation ( @xmath108 confidence ) . since flares from sgr",
    "a@xmath0have been observed to occur very frequently ( about once per day , baganoff 2003 ) , here we estimate the effects of such flares on the scattered halos .",
    "the time dependence of the scattered halo intensity at various angles can help to constrain the dust and gas distribution near the galactic center .",
    "if a typical strong flare occurred just before or at the start of the reported observation of quiescent emission of b03 , it could have contributed significantly to the intensity of the diffuse emission .",
    "photons that reach us via one or more scatterings will have to travel a longer path length and so will be delayed compared to those arriving directly .",
    "if the source is variable , such as a flare , then this time delay can yield information on the distance and dust distribution to a source ( trmper & schnfelder 1973 ; draine & tan 2003 ) . for single scattering from dust that is a distance @xmath109 along the line of sight to a source at distance @xmath103 , the delay is @xmath110^{1/2 } -1\\right\\ } \\\\ & \\approx & \\frac{d}{c}\\frac{y}{1-y}\\frac{\\theta^2}{2 } = 9.7 \\left(\\frac{d}{8.0{\\,{\\rm kpc}}}\\right)\\frac{y}{1-y } \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1\\arcsec}\\right)^2\\:{\\rm s}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we expect much of the dust towards sgr  a@xmath0to be close to the source : for @xmath111  pc , @xmath112 , so the delay @xmath113 for @xmath114 becomes 760 , 1500 , 3100  s.    figure [ fig : lightcurve2 ] shows the time evolution of the scattered halo intensity following two different hypothetical flares , whose properties we have take to be similar to the flare observed by b01 ( f1 ) and that observed by porquet et al . ( 2003 ) ( f2 ) .",
    "the evolution of intensities depends on the distribution of gas near sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "given the actual lightcurve of an observed flare , and with careful subtraction of the quiescent component , one may use the time - varying component of the x - ray halo to constrain the line of sight gas distribution close to the galactic center .    to compare to the observations of b03 we find the mean intensity averaged over the @xmath5240  ks observation period of b03 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : halonormsimp2 ] .",
    "the delayed arrival of x - ray photons from when sgr  a@xmath0was in a more luminous state can boost the mean halo intensity in the following @xmath5240  ks by a factor of two or so .",
    "we stress that for these particular observations , while there is evidence for a flare near the beginning of the observation period , the actual lightcurve is unconstrained .",
    "thus our calculation makes use of representative flare properties , as seen during other observations .",
    "the large column densities of gas and dust towards the galactic center strongly absorb and scatter x - rays , so that a careful treatment of these processes is necessary to infer the intrinsic properties of sources in this region , such as their luminosity , spectra , and spatial size .",
    "the fact that much of the dust lies close to the gc means that the scattering halos are much more concentrated than the halos seen around typical sources in the outer galaxy .",
    "the same phenomenon also occurs for halos observed around x - ray sources in star - forming regions , since these also tend to contain a large column density of dust near the source .    in this paper",
    "we have analyzed the effects of the intervening gas and dust on galactic center x - ray sources , using a realistic range of models for the total column and spatial distribution .",
    "we used reasonable estimates for chemical abundances and depletions of the gas and dust .",
    "we calculated the radiative transfer using realistic scattering properties of dust grains , and considered the effects of multiple scattering .",
    "we also evaluated the importance of different grain size distributions .",
    "the intrinsic luminosities and spectra of emission from sgr  a@xmath0 in its quiescent state and in two flaring states are shown in figure  [ fig : specqpownew ] and table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "these estimates depend on the amount of intervening dust and gas , which we have related to the most relevant observable , the extinction in the k band .",
    "the quiescent 2 - 10  kev luminosity ranges from 3 to @xmath115 , as @xmath27 ranges from 3.5 to 7.0 magnitudes . at the same time , the spectral index , @xmath81 , ranges from 1.8 to 3.3 .",
    "the flaring states are about 10 to 30 times more luminous , with the flare observed by chandra having a harder spectral index by about 0.7 - 1.0 and the flare observed by xmm - newton having a harder spectral index by about 2.0 .",
    "the uncertainties can be reduced once a better estimate for @xmath27 is available .",
    "we have calculated the azimuthally averaged intensity profile of the dust - scattered halo around sgr  a@xmath0 , and shown that it can dominate the chandra psf beyond @xmath521 arcsec ( see fig .",
    "this effect contributes to the diffuse emission seen around sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "4 . the dust - scattered halos of multiple sources in the gc region overlap , but only account for at most @xmath117 of the diffuse emission inside 10of sgr  a@xmath0 .    \\5 . motivated by the detection of enhanced emission at the start of the observation of b03 and by other observations that show that strong flares occur about once per day ( baganoff 2003 )",
    ", we have modeled the effects of flared emission from sgr  a@xmath0 . for reasonable distributions of the dust , the time delay for scattered emission is of order a thousand to several thousand seconds at 1 , increasing quadratically with the angle .",
    "we show how measurements of the evolution of the scattered halo following a flare can help constrain the dust s spatial distribution .",
    "it is possible that delayed scattering from a flare accounts for some of the diffuse emission close to sgr  a@xmath0 in the observation of b03 . to disentangle the quiescent component , data in a period at least @xmath118  ks after a major flare needs to be analyzed",
    "our fiducial models for the contribution of a dust - scattered halo to the extended emission of sgr  a@xmath0can explain up to @xmath3 of the observed intensity at @xmath119 , corresponding to the extent of the bondi radius",
    ". thus earlier estimates of the gas luminosity and density may be overestimated by factors of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , respectively .",
    "previous determinations of the bondi accretion rate and luminosity could be overestimated by similar factors .",
    "we conclude , like b03 , that the emission around sgr  a@xmath0is extended .",
    "to explain the entire emission as being due to dust scattering would require at least a doubling of the observed column in material at least @xmath5225  pc from sgr  a@xmath0(but not substantially changing the columns to the other nearby gc sources ) , and/or the presence of an exceptionally strong flare just prior to the observation period .",
    "the latter possibility can be tested by looking at the observed halo from sgr  a@xmath0 in more quiescent periods in existing ( but unpublished ) data .",
