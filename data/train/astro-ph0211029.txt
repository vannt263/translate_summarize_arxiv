    "the evolution of planetary nebulae ( pne ) is driven by several distinct processes .",
    "the original density and velocity distribution are determined by the agb mass loss .",
    "subsequently , this is modified by the photo - ionization , and the interaction with the hot , fast wind from the central star . together , these give rise to the intricate structures seen in many pne .",
    "the first models are appearing which use all of these processes to calculate the instantaneous density and velocity structure ( e.g. corradi et al .",
    "the density structures can be obtained from high - resolution imaging , but determining the dynamical structures requires high - resolution spectra .",
    "we have developed a technique to deconvolve the velocity field from the emission line profiles . using [ ] and [ ] ,",
    "this has shown that the velocity tends to increase sharply towards the outer edge of the nebula , in agreement with hydrodynamical models .",
    "for pne with [ wc ] central stars , the lines show evidence for turbulent velocity fields ( acker et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "if a larger set of lines is available , the velocity field can be obtained with much finer radial resolution , especially if narrow - band images are also available .",
    "such data is needed for comparison with the details of the hydrodynamic models , and in this way can test the evolution of pn nuclei and their mass loss history . here",
    "we apply the torun models to deep echelle spectra of three pne , located in the galactic bulge , the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) .",
    "the new data allow us to deduce the velocity fields with unprecedented detail .",
    "there are two main reasons for this improvement : lines of many ionization stages are available , and the spectral resolution of 60000 is well fitted to the thermal broadening .    in the next sections , after a summary of the torun models , we present the results for three objects .",
    "evidence for several shock - like features is found .",
    "although the objects were selected based on their different metallicity , they are remarkably similar . the core masses are calculated using the dynamical age : they are all close to 0.62m@xmath1 .",
    "we discuss the various shocks and interpret these in terms of structures seen in the hydrodynamical models .",
    "one object shows evidence for strong turbulence : we discuss the relation between this and the shocks seen in the other nebulae .",
    "we selected three pne from different stellar populations : the bulge , the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy and the smc .",
    "these have the advantage that the distances are approximately known , which benefits the photo - ionization modeling .",
    "diameters are known from published monochromatic images for all three nebulae .",
    "one of our interests was the effect of metallicity : values for the metallicity have been published for these pne , ranging from slightly subsolar ( bulge pn ) to @xmath2 dex ( smc pn ) .",
    "all three central stars are hot with very similar luminosity .",
    "the observations were carried out at the eso 3.5 m ntt telescope , in august 1999 .",
    "we used the echelle mode in the red arm , using grating # 14 and cross disperser # 3 .",
    "the slit - width was 1@xmath3  and slit length 3@xmath3 .",
    "the spectra cover the wavelength range 43007000  at a resolution of @xmath4 , corresponding to 5kms@xmath0 : this is about the thermal line width for oxygen .",
    "the spectra were summed along the slit , flat - fielded and corrected for the response curves , using the midas echelle reduction package .",
    "each source was observed for @xmath5sec .",
    "the rms noise of the final 1-d spectra is approximately @xmath6 of the h@xmath7 flux .    for the analysis we selected several ( 89 ) strong and well exposed lines which cover a broad range of excitation potentials .",
    "this allows us to probe the whole nebular depth from the highly ionized inner regions ( 4686 ) to the neutral outer layers ( [ ] 6302 ) .",
    "the three pairs and , and , and and , each come from very similar region , leaving effectively five independent probes .",
    "the smc pn was unresolved but the other two pne show line splitting in the low - excitation lines , which indicates they are partially resolved .",
    "we applied the torun models ( gesicki et al . 1996 ) to deduce the density and velocity radial distribution of our pne .",
    "a brief description of the procedure is repeated here .",
    "we emphasize that the models assume spherical symmetry ( as do most photo - ionization models ) and this is likely to be the limiting approximation .",
    "the central star is approximated by a black - body atmosphere defined by an effective temperature and a luminosity .",
    "the nebula is approximated as a spherical shell defined by an inner and an outer radius , a total mass and a radial density distribution .",
    "a photo - ionization model is calculated to fit the ( published ) line ratios , h@xmath7 flux , and electron density and temperature .",
    "we adopt published values for the metallicity .",
    "the model is used to calculate predicted surface brightness profiles , which are compared to published monochromatic images .",
    "the model is iterated until an acceptable agreement is found : the main free parameters in this iterating procedure are the radial density distribution and the central star parameters . for every line under consideration",
    ", a radial emissivity distribution is calculated .",
    "subsequently a radial velocity profile is assumed , with the velocity varying smoothly with radius . at every radial position ,",
    "the line profile is calculated from the local velocity ( and turbulence ) , the local electron temperature and the local emissivity .",
    "for every point on the image of the nebula , we calculate a total line profile by integrating along the line of sight .",
    "the observed line profile is obtained by masking the model nebula using the slit parameters , and summing over this slit .",
    "the seeing is taken ( approximately ) into account as an additional broadening of the slit . comparing the predicted profile with the observations",
    "now allows one to correct the assumed velocity field .",
    "in addition to the velocity profile , a turbulent component can also be included .",
    "new to the torun models is the possibility to allow for a radially varying degree of turbulence .    in the torun models ,",
    "the radial velocity is specified at an arbitrary number of positions .",
    "these are fitted using smoothed cubic splines . in previous papers ,",
    "relatively simple velocity profiles were applied . here",
    "we investigate the velocity fields in much more detail than has been possible before .",
    "because spherical symmetry is built into our ( photo - ionization ) models we restrict the analysis only to those objects which are not too far away from appearing circular .",
    "although many pne show very complicated structures , both in images and spectra , near - spherical pne still constitute a significant subset of all pne with known shapes .",
    "depending on the definition their fraction is estimated as between 10% and 25% ( soker 2002 ) .",
    "the fraction of objects suitable for our analysis can be much broader if we include moderately elliptical pne .",
    "an example of a prolate ellipsoidal pn is ngc7027 , with an axial ratio of 2:1 .",
    "long - slit echelle observations show that the same velocity law applies to both nebular axes ( walsh et al .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations of aspherical pne ( mellema 1995 ) find uniform expansion in all directions .",
    "these observational and theoretical findings suggest that our spherical velocity modelling can be applied to mildly elliptical nebulae , which constitute of the order of 50%  of known objects .",
    "bipolar objects , which can have high - velocity polar flows , should be avoided especially when integrated spectra are used .",
    "the presence of bipolar flows is often evident from integrated spectra . in earlier applications of the torun models",
    "objects with marked bipolarity were always excluded .",
    "the velocity accuracy of our method is restricted by the spectral resolution of the observations , limited by the spectrograph and the thermal line widths . in the present work",
    "we can not resolve details smaller than about 5kms@xmath0 .",
    "the spatial resolution of our modelling is limited by the apparent size of the pne which is comparable to both the size of the slit and the seeing .",
    "because of these observational limitations the analysis must be restricted to large scale structures and flows , and small inhomogeneities can not be addressed .",
    "this also argues against attempting bipolar nebulae .    in the next sections , describing each single pn , we discuss the available images .",
    "there is some evidence for deviations from sphericity : wray16 - 423 may show elongation , smp5 is circular but could be a flattened shell seen face on ( suggested by the fact that the central brightness is not well fitted ) , and m 2 - 31 appears circular .",
    "we find no evidence of marked bipolarity in images , and the regular line profiles show no indications of ( bi-)polar flows .    using a radiation - hydrodynamic code , mellema ( 1997 ) suggests that bipolar nebulae much easier evolve around higher mass central stars ( 0.836 m@xmath8 ) while lower mass stars ( 0.605 m@xmath8 ) tend to produce elliptical pne .",
    "this is because the less massive star evolves slower , giving the density distribution in the surrounding shell time to smooth out .",
    "anticipating our results presented later , the fact that our central stars have masses close to the lower value favours an elliptical shape over a bipolar one .",
    "the velocity field is obtained by trial and error ; we can not be certain that the solutions are unique .",
    "nevertheless we always start with the simplest possible field , i.e. constant velocity . while comparing the computed profiles with the observed ones , taking into account the earlier calculated ion stratifications , we change the velocities at different radial distances to obtain the required change in profiles .",
    "we always search for the simplest solution which improves as much as possible all reliable residual in line shapes .",
    "we illustrate this procedure in detail when discussing the first object ; for the other two pne we skip this step and show only the final results .",
    "tables[taba ] and [ tabb ] summarize the input parameters of the three modelled pne .",
    "they also list some models results and compare them with literature data . for the comparison with the observed @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we list the model values at the radii at which the emissivity of the relevant ion peaks . @xmath11",
    "denotes the mean value of the velocity field weighted by the mass distribution ( gesicki et al .",
    "the metallicity listed as [ o / h ] in fact presents the average of [ ne / h ] and [ o / h ] : neon follows oxygen very closely in the ism ( henry 1989 ) with identical production sites , but oxygen in pne can be affected by 3rd dredge of primary oxygen , especially at low metallicity ( pquignot et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the individual objects are discussed extensively in the following sections , where literature references are given .",
    "each section begins with a description of the nebula , followed by subsections on the density distribution and the velocity field .",

    "a high - resolution image of a low - excitation line could resolve this issue , but no such image is presently available .",
    "the model is ionization bounded .",
    "we begin the discussion of the first nebula with an overview of simple velocity fields , to illustrate the procedure to obtain an acceptable model .",
    "the results of the initial models are shown in fig.[bad_fit ] .",
    "we show only six lines in the plot , nevertheless the chosen lines represent the whole nebula .",
    "the constant - velocity - field model is presented in two versions : without and with additional turbulence .",
    "the short - dash line presents the non - turbulent solution : the value of 25kms@xmath0 is on average the best value . to show how additional turbulent motions change the line shapes we compute the same model with a very high turbulence of 15kms@xmath0 .",
    "the dotted line presents this exaggerated case ; it shows that the line wings are broadened and simultaneously the maxima are smoothed to a gaussian shape .",
    "both cases fail for almost all lines .    before modifying the velocity we look at the lower right panel of fig.[bad_fit ] showing the radial distributions of emissivities .",
    "again not all nine lines are presented because several distributions almost overlap and h@xmath7 follows closely the density shown in the next panel .",
    "fig.[bad_fit ] indicates the radii of formation of considered lines , i.e. the radii where the line profiles are most sensitive to changes in velocity .",

    "the new fit shows clearly that this is the appropriate way to reproduce the low excitation outermost lines .",

    ", the monotonic velocity field also fails at the highest excitations in wray16 - 423 .",
    "the line is too broad : a high velocity ( 50kms@xmath0 ) , high density region is required near the inner nebular radius .",
    "further out the velocity must decrease significantly ( to about 15kms@xmath0 ) to reproduce the narrow cores of the [ ] and [ ] lines .",
    "the outer regions accelerate to 60kms@xmath0 , and must show a density decreasing with radius , otherwise the high velocity wings become too pronounced . a constant density halo can be ruled out .    this velocity field is shown in fig.[bad_fit ] as the solid line .",
    "the general shape of all 9 lines is reproduced ( see the figure ) , but it is clearly visible that a number of lines with intermediate excitation ( [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] ) have broader wings than the fit predicts .",
    "this shows that a component expanding at about 40kms@xmath0 , at intermediate radii , is missing . adding this additional high velocity component improves the fit significantly .",
    "the resulting velocity profile , and the resulting emission line profiles , are shown in fig.[fig_w ] .",
    "the assumed velocity components have an almost negligible effect on the h@xmath7 line because ( being least massive ) hydrogen is strongly thermally broadened .",
    "the best model gives an interesting velocity profile .",

    "the result is shown in the same figure , together with the predicted distribution .",
    "the h@xmath7 image shows an outer radius of 0.25 .",
    "the [ ] image is somewhat larger , and peaks further out than h@xmath7 by about 0.04 .",
    "the reason is that the star is sufficiently hot that the innermost region is dominated by ( e.g. leene &  pottasch 1987 ) , up to the density maximum at 0.1  radius .",
    "the observed [ ] emission remains brighter than h@xmath7 in the outer regions .",
    "this can be expected in density - bounded nebulae , where the zone extends to the outer radius .",

    "smp5 appears to be ionization - bounded .",

    ", the [ ] zone terminates at a radius of 0.4 .",
    "placing the ionization front still farther out could reproduce the tail of the [ ] distribution even better , but its radius can not be much larger than 0.5 : otherwise the [ ] 6300  line would be expected to show line splitting , which is not observed .",
    "increasing the stellar @xmath30 would shift the [ ] image still farther out but it is not an overwhelming improvement : we adopted the temperature of liu et al .",
    "we obtain a better fit to the brightness distribution than liu et al . :",

    ", the outer region should be visible in the 6585line .",
    "an image at this wavelengths could decide between the two models .",
    "without such an image , the halo is in essence a free parameter in our modelling .",
    "we note that our model fails to fit the image details in the very central region .",
    "a consequence of the assumed outer region is the high nebular mass of 0.61m@xmath8 , much higher than 0.194m@xmath8 obtained by liu et al .",
    "nevertheless the h@xmath7 flux and the line ratios are well reproduced .",
    "the different emission lines show different line widths .",
    "assuming the halo has constant density , or slightly decreasing like in wray16 - 423 , causes the maxima of the emissivity distribution of all lines to be contained in the dense central region .",
    "but the different line widths indicate the line emission regions are well separated . introducing a small density increase",
    "outwards shifts the low excitation lines outwards , as required . the , , ions now exhibit two emissivity maxima : one connected with the density maximum , the other with the ionization stratification in the outer region .    the line is broader than [ ] and [ ] which implies an increase of the velocity towards the central star .",
    "the width of the [ ] line indicates acceleration at the outer nebular radius . a flat - top line profile results from a spatially unresolved layer expanding with constant velocity ( gesicki & zijlstra 2000 ) .",
    "the narrow flat tops of the [ ] and [ ] lines indicate the presence of such layers in the inner dense layers , with a low expansion velocity of about 15kms@xmath0 .",
    "similar flat tops in the [ ] , [ ] , [ ] lines indicate another velocity minimum at about 20kms@xmath0 in the outer layers .",
    "the line wings , which extend over 50kms@xmath0 , require a velocity maximum in between .",

    "the model is calculated for a star with core mass @xmath44 ( blcker 1995 ) , very close to the core masses of the three pne in this paper .",
    "the first three models from their evolutionary sequence , ( corresponding to ages of 1776 , 4603 and 5462 years counted from the end of agb ) have sizes and densities similar to our pne .",
    "we briefly summarize the first phases of evolution presented in the two mentioned papers :    * at epoch 1 ( 1776 years ) the model nebula has almost constant density ( @xmath45@xmath46 ) up to the ionization front ( @xmath47 cm ) where both density and velocity sharply increase . * between epoch 1 and 2 ,",
    "the ionization front breaks through the dense swept - up shell and the full circumstellar envelope ionizes . * at epoch 2 ( 4603 years ) an inner denser shell ( @xmath48@xmath46 ) begins to develop , as a result of the pressure from an inner hot bubble. the hot bubble is due to a shocked hot wind from the star . the outer nebular shell , which is the remnant of the dense shell of epoch 1 , has a density @xmath49@xmath46 ; at its outer edge ( @xmath50 cm ) a shock wave is running into the ambient slow material .",
    "the density spike caused earlier by the ionization front , and located at the outer edge , has almost disappeared .",
    "* at epoch 3 ( 5462 years ) the central star approaches its maximum temperature .",
    "the nebula shows a pronounced double shell structure .",
    "the outer shell , extending to @xmath51 cm , has a nearly constant density ( @xmath52@xmath46 ) : this is the swept - up agb wind .",
    "the inner layers have a three times higher density with a pronounced maximum of @xmath53@xmath46 at its inner edge ( @xmath54 cm ) and a much weaker maximum at its outer edge ( @xmath55 cm ) .      in our pne ,",
    "the inner cavity radius is about 10% of the outer shell radius . in the hydrodynamical models the inner radius of ionized nebula is about",
    "50% of the outer radius .",
    "this difference suggests that the transition from agb to post - agb wind occurred different from schnberner s scenario . in subsection 7.1",
    "we suggested that the fast wind may have been weaker than assumed in the hydrodynamical models .",
    "alternatively , the star may have evolved faster ( the core mass is slightly higher than in the models ) giving the fast wind less time to act , or the agb expansion velocity may have been low giving a denser , more compact agb shell .",
    "perinotto et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discuss two sequences differing only in the initial matter distribution .",
    "two snapshots from these sequences , taken at about 1800 years , show a markedly different density distribution .",
    "our experience suggests that the density and velocity distributions would be discernible with the torun models .",
    "the structure of our pne , with a high density inner ring and a low density outer region , corresponds to theoretical models 45@xmath56 years after the agb .",
    "but the models are density bounded while our pne are ionization bounded .",
    "our pne have inner rings denser and closer to the central star than the theoretical models .",
    "it is possible that the growing density of the inner shell blocked the ionizing radiation and a previously fully ionized pn entered a recombination phase .",
    "apart from this difference , the epoch-2 model shows a structured dense inner ring with an outer region in which the density slightly increases outwards .",
    "such a situation we met in smp5 . in the epoch-3 model there is a main density maximum at the inner nebular edge with a smaller but noticeable density bump further out .",
    "this situation we found in m2 - 31 .",
    "for the first time our analysis led to strongly - non monotonic velocities .",
    "it is encouraging that the velocity spikes which we find correspond to features found in hydrodynamical models .",
    "however , the intermediate velocity jump can also be interpreted in terms of clumpy structures or asphericity , as discussed later .",
    "two pne show a velocity field in a w shape .",
    "the velocity distribution for smp5 is anti - correlated with the density run ( see fig.[vel_ms ] ) as can be expected for gas flows .",
    "the hydrodynamical models suggest several processes are responsible for the features in the velocity field .    *",
    "the innermost region represents the contact discontinuity between the hot inner region and the pn .",
    "it is accelerated by the fast wind of the central star . for a typical mass loss rate of @xmath57 and velocity @xmath58",
    ", the energy in the accelerated shell in our models equates to roughly 400yr of the wind energy .",
    "the acceleration can occur through thermal pressure ( schnberner &  steffen 1999 ) or through direct acceleration of a wind - swept shell ( harrington et al .",
    "* the outer velocity increase is well understood , and represents the shock driven into the ambient agb wind by the thermal pressure of the ionized planetary nebula . *",
    "the intermediate shock seen as a weak feature in schnberner &  steffen ( 1999 ) is the compressed agb wind ( a density enhancement ) at the outer edge of the inner dense swept - up shell .",
    "the outer velocity increase is seen in all three objects .",
    "the innermost increase is seen in two objects ; in the third object ( m2 - 31 ) it falls in the region for which we have no velocity probe .",
    "the explanation for these apparently common features appears secure .",
    "the intermediate shock is seen in the same 2 objects ( and in m2 - 31 may take the form of a superposition of many such shocks ) .",
    "it is not clear that the above explanation as the compressed agb wind is unique .",
    "mass - loss variations in the agb wind could cause density jumps at various radii .",
    "an effect of such a jump is in fact present in the models of corradi et al .",
    "( 2000a ) , namely the trace of the last thermal pulse on the agb , which in the model sequence is located a distance of about @xmath59 cm .",
    "the velocity jump associated with this feature grows to about 20kms@xmath0 as the main expanding nebula approaches this structure .",
    "this particular feature is not observable , being located in the low - density agb wind .",
    "however , its evolution suggests that any mass - loss fluctuation during the ejection of the main nebula may affect the density and velocity field in the pn .",
    "evidence is emerging that the agb mass loss fluctuates on time scales of the order @xmath60@xmath56yr ( hashimoto 1994 , zijlstra et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the turbulence in m2 - 31 could be interpreted as a special case where instead of a single intermediate shock , many shock - lets are present .",
    "the winds from [ wc ] stars show strong time - variability ( e.g. grosdidier et al .",
    "2000 ) : the variable pressure at the inner edge of the pn could cause a progression of shock waves traveling into the nebula .",
    "the velocity amplitude of the observed waves , or the turbulent velocity , is little larger than the sound speed ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this suggests an unusual picture of a planetary nebula criss - crossed by a multitude of sound waves .",
    "we should consider the possibility that in our pne the inner shock found can actually be a spherical approximation to more azimuthally irregular situation .",
    "the nebulae can be elliptical in shape exhibiting different structure in different directions .",
    "the wind breaking through the holes in the inner dense shell can accelerate a layer at intermediate radii , and the inner nebular region may be a mixture of faster and slower matter",
    ". the outer shell can fragment into clumps .",
    "a 3d photoionization modelling which can address such situations has been applied to ngc3132 by monteiro et al .",
    "such modelling usually attempts to fit the observed image of a nebula .",
    "monteiro et al . reached an important conclusion that different geometries can reproduce the same observational data .",
    "the low - resolution spectroscopic data can be well modelled by an ellipsoidal geometry , but by using additional data from [ ] line ratios and [ ] velocity profiles they deduce a diabolo - shape geometry for ngc3132 . however , in their calculations they made several simplifications , among them the assumption of a linearly increasing velocity field .",
    "such modelling appears promising but at present still suffers from the large number of free parameters involved , and from the prohibitive cpu time needed for fully self - consistent calculations ; because of these limitations , spherical models still should be considered as valuable approximations .",
    "we discuss briefly two possibilities which may affect the discussion of wray16 - 423 and smp5 ( the turbulent m2 - 31 is a different story ) .",
    "we first investigate whether the central velocity cusp of the w could be an artifact of the assumption of spherical symmetry .",
    "this is done for the case of wray16 - 423 where some evidence for ellipticity exists .",
    "the requirement for a high velocity region comes from the extended wings of the [ ] and [ ] lines : we therefore attempt to reproduce these without such a region .",
    "to approximate an elliptical model , we use a two - component model .",
    "this essentially doubles the number of free parameters , so that one can expect that the data can be fitted much more easily but the uniqueness of the model will be affected . to limit the number of free parameters , we fix the inner and outer radius , and the velocity profile , and only vary the density distribution . compared to our spherical model",
    ", one of the components must be opaque with an ionization boundary at our estimated outer radius .",
    "this component will explain the observed low excitation lines .",
    "the second component has a lower density , giving a transparent model with the same outer radius .",
    "( a different outer radius could be assumed but this would be wholly unconstrained with the present data . )    we adopt a u-shaped velocity field which is the same in all directions , as found observationally for ngc7027 ( walsh et al .",
    "our question is now whether a density profile exists for the transparent component which can reproduce the line wings .",
    "one such possibility is presented in fig.[elipt ] .",
    "this shows that a relatively small change in density distribution will shift the line formation zones of [ ] and [ ] ions outwards so that the line wings trace the outermost acceleration",
    ". the density should in fact not be too much lower , otherwise the line wings would be too weak to be observed . not shown are the line which is also well fitted and other observed low excited lines which are not fitted .",
    "this example suggests a possible explanation of our observations , not in terms of a variable velocity in the intermediate region , but a variable azimuthal ionization stratification with a simpler velocity field .",
    "this discussion certainly concerns also smp5 .",
    "the turbulent velocity field of the third pn could not easily be fitted in this way .",
    "it is well known ( gruenwald et al .",
    "1997 ) that without spherical symmetry the outward - only approximation fails .",
    "this approximation is applied in our photoionization code .",
    "therefore we refrain from quantitative analysis .",
    "the tentative model is only intended to give support for the considered possibility .",
    "pne show a wealth of sub and microstructures , including clumping .",
    "the best known case is perhaps the helix , but hst shows small structures in many objects .",
    "however they are far easier seen in images than in spectra .",
    "high density clumps tend to have lower temperatures ( e.g. the dusty helix globules observed by meaburn et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , low ionization knots seen in images of balick ( 1987 ) and discussed by kahn & breitschwerdt 1990 ) , while the forbidden lines are highly temperature sensitive and tend to trace the extended gas .",
    "large and bright knots are also observed in some nebulae .",
    "however , the case of ngc6543 analyzed by bryce et al .",
    "( 1992 ) shows that the explosive appearance seen in images in fact corresponds to a relatively inert kinematic situation where the bright knots are co - moving with the faint halo .",
    "also corradi et al .",
    "( 2000b ) when analyzing nebulae ic2553 and ngc5882 found that knots visible in low - ionization lines do not show evidence of moving with peculiar velocities compared with the general motion .",
    "however , clumps can affect the velocity structure .",
    "if the inner dense shell is clumpy , the fast wind from the central star could be breaking through the holes , and set up a secondary swept - up shell at a larger radius , in the lower density outer regions .",
    "such an effect is seen in the abell nebulae a30 and a78 , which have dense clumps very close to the star , with a cometary appearance , and an irregular , accelerated shell at about 0.5 of the outer radius ( meaburn et al .",
    "1998 , meaburn & lpez 1996 ) . in these objects",
    "the location of the fast wind is obvious in observations , as it is hydrogen - poor .",
    "it is also possible that the outer shell is clumpy , e.g. , as in the already mentioned ic2553 and ngc5882 .",
    "both pne reveal a double shell structure ; both outer shells are more spherical and expand faster than the inner shells .",
    "the low ionization knots , of intriguing origin , follow the movement of the surrounding outer shells .",
    "this also gives a situation , as in the elliptical model above , where the same accelerated outer regions can explain both the extended wings of high excited lines in the transparent fragments , and the line splitting of the low excited lines in the opaque fragments .",
    "high - resolution echelle observations , covering a range of emission lines , provide a powerful tool to study the velocity distribution inside ( unresolved ) planetary nebulae .",
    "we analyze three objects , in the bulge , the sagittarius dwarf galaxy and the smc .",
    "they show similar structure : a small inner radius , a dense inner region and a lower - density outer shell .",
    "the dynamical core masses are almost equal , around 0.62m@xmath62 , in spite of very different metallicities and progenitor masses .",
    "all three pne show evidence for jumps in expansion velocity , at various locations in the nebulae .",
    "the velocity stratification as found in our spherical model is supported by the observed ion stratification . in wray16 - 423 and m2 - 31",
    "we detect different line splitting for different ions , confirming that the low excitation ions trace more extended regions .",
    "the proximity of the dense inner shell to the central star is not seen in the existing hydrodynamical models .",
    "the assumptions concerning late agb and early post - agb mass - loss evolution need to be verified to model the three presented pne .",
    "three main velocity features appear .",
    "velocity maxima are found at the inner and the outer edge of the nebulae .",
    "the outer acceleration is a common , known feature ; the evidence for the innermost acceleration is new .",
    "( in one case , m2 - 31 , the evidence at the inner edge is tentative as we lack a good probe for the region . )",
    "hydrodynamic models , and energy arguments , strongly suggest that the inner one is due to acceleration by the fast wind from the hot central star .",
    "the outer one can be explained as the overpressured ionized region pushing into the outer agb wind .",
    "the third feature is a high velocity , low density region affecting the intermediate excitations ions , which is seen in two objects .",
    "the origin of this region is not clear .",
    "three possible explanations are given , all of which have some support in models and/or observations of pne .",
    "first , it can be associated with a weak shock seen in hydrodynamical models at the boundary where the dense inner shell expands into the lower - density region .",
    "however , the observed feature is much stronger than in the model .",
    "second , it can be due to an ellipticity of the nebula , where in a direction with lower density , the line formation region of the intermediate excitation ions extends into the outer acceleration zone .",
    "a similar situation could exists if the outer region is clumpy .",
    "thirdly , the region could trace a secondary shell accelerated by a stellar wind breaking through an innermost clumpy region , as seen in , e.g. , the pne a30 and a78 .",
    "it is not possible to decide on the correct explanation based on the present data .",
    "one nebula shows evidence for either fine radial velocity structure , or strong turbulence .",
    "this pn has a [ wc]-type central star , a characteristic which has previously been linked to turbulent nebulae .",
    "there are indications for an anti - correlation between density and velocity .",
    "we suggest that the apparent turbulence may be a superposition of many shocks with velocity near the sound speed .",

    "<S> the internal velocity fields of planetary nebulae are studied with a resolution of 5kms@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze deep echelle spectra from three nebulae in the bulge , the sagittarius dwarf and the smc . </S>",
    "<S> no effects of metallicity is seen , except possibly a slower onset of the fast wind from the central star . </S>",
    "<S> robust evidence is found for the existence of a high - velocity shock at the inner edges of the nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> such a shock is predicted in hydrodynamical models but had not previously been observed . </S>",
    "<S> the shock gas is accelerated by the fast wind from the central star . </S>",
    "<S> a similar shock at the outer edges traces the expansion of the ionized shell into the ambient agb wind . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for localized regions of high velocity is also found from lines of intermediate excitation , for two of nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> we explore several possible interpretations : ( 1 ) an embedded shock at intermediate radii , as predicted by hydrodynamic models at the position of the outer edge of the swept - up inner shell ; ( 2 ) deviations form spherical symmetry , where in some directions the intermediate - excitation lines extend into the region of the outer shock ; ( 3 ) an intermediate swept - up shell , as seen in some galactic planetary nebulae . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining nebula , with a [ wc ] star , shows strong turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> this may trace a superposition of many embedded shock - lets . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest a relation to the time - variable [ wc ] wind , giving a planetary nebula subjected to a multitude of sound waves .    </S>",
