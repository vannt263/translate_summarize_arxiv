    "recent surveys have concluded that a substantial fraction of the high redshift submillimetre ( sub - mm ) selected galaxy population comprises morphologically complex systems with high instantaneous star formation rates and actively fuelled agn ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; barger et al .",

    "understanding the importance of this population requires identifying their power source ( e.g. to determine whether star formation- or agn- activity dominate the luminosity output ) and , perhaps more importantly , masses for these galaxies",
    ". although they have only moderate space densities , their apparantly high star formation rates mean their contribution to the cosmic star formation rate could be significant ( e.g. chapman et al .",
    "moreover , the star formation activity suggests _ a priori _ that these galaxies should house starburst - driven superwinds  outflows which expel gas from the galaxy potential ( e.g. pettini et al .",
    "2001 ; shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) and which are believed to play an important role in regulating galaxy formation , preventing the bulk of baryons cooling into stars ( the `` cosmic cooling crisis '' , white & rees 1978 ; cen & ostriker 1999 ; balogh et al .",
    "however , to study the energetics and dynamics of these frequently complex systems ( e.g. smail et al .",
    "2004 ) we must trace the distribution of the velocity and intensity of emission lines on sub - arcsecond scales . ideally , this should be achieved in 2-d to untangle the complex morphologies of these systems and , in addition to search for signatures of lensing , which might provide a more mundane explanation of the apparently intense luminosities of these galaxies ( tecza et al .",

    "the gmos data reduction pipeline was modified such that the extracted spectra included the blue edge of the ccd ( where the ly@xmath0 emission falls ) and then used to extract and wavelength calibrate the spectra of each ifu element .",
    "the variations in fibre - to - fibre response were removed using the continuum around the expected range of ly@xmath0 emission . to check the wavelength calibration around 4100 we wavelength calibrated the cuar arc observations and fit the arc lines between 4000 and 4200  with gaussian profiles .",
    "we measure the rms offset between the observed arc line centroids and the arc line list to be less than 0.02  ( which corresponds to less than 8@xmath4 in the rest frame of the galaxy ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that any velocity structures or offsets in the gmos ifu data are real and not simply an artifact of the observations .",
    "to search for velocity structure the spectra were averaged over a @xmath43 pixel ( 0.6@xmath2@xmath160.6@xmath2 ) spatial region , except where the signal was too low to give a significant detection of the line , in which case the smoothing area was increased to @xmath44 pixels . in regions where this averaging process still failed to give an adequate @xmath45 ( i.e. the inclusion of an emission line component does not improve the fit ) , no fit was made . in order to detect and fit the line we required a minimum s / n of 3 and checked every fit by eye . in the inner regions of the galaxy all of the gaussian profile fits",

    "the spatial extent of the ly@xmath0 is @xmath59kpc , however , most interestingly the velocity of the emission line is placed @xmath8 redward of the systemic velocity of this system .",

    "unfortunately these two images look very similar and it is not possible to identify which component hosts the agn",

    "it appears that the broad co(43 ) emission arises from two components ( a bright component at z=2.383 , and a fainter component at slightly higher redshift ( at z@xmath12.388 ) which is located @xmath64 to the ne of the first component ) .",
    "narrow co(76 ) emission is also detected at the same position and redshift as the lower redshift co(43 ) emission .",

    "the implied molecular gas mass from the co observations is @xmath65 , thus the dynamical mass ( @xmath66 ) for n2 850.4 is approximately four times greater than gas mass estimate suggesting that this system has a high baryonic fraction in the central regions .    using the h@xmath0 emission line as a star - formation rate indicator we can calculate the star formation rate in each of the three components . for solar abundances and adopting a salpeter imf , the conversion between h@xmath0 flux and star formation rate is sfr(@xmath6@xmath67)=@xmath68l(h@xmath0)@xmath69 ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",

    "nevertheless , the ly@xmath0 emission from n2 850.4 is much more peaked than lab1 and therefore this halo may represent a different evolutionary phase .",
    "unfortunately , due to the very different surface brightnesses of the systems and the large pixel scale of the sauron ifu ( which has 1.0@xmath2 fibres ) , it is very difficult to directly compare the dynamics of the two systems ( bower et al .",
    "2004 ) . in terms of the wider environment , it is interesting to note that a second sub - mm detected galaxy has recently been detected in the same structure as n2 850.4 ( at a distance of 2.5mpc ; chapman et al .",
    "2005a ) .",
    "the observed velocity offset between h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 emission is comparable to those seen in the spectra of rest - frame uv selected galaxies at z@xmath772 ( e.g.  teplitz et al .",
    "2000 ; pettini et al .   2001 ; shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) where they have been attributed to galactic scale outflows produced by the collective effects of heating and outflows from supernovae . in this scenario ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 appears redshifted due to resonant scattering of photons from the inner surface of a receding shell of material .",
    "such flows have been termed `` superwinds '' by analogy to the wind seen in the spectra of local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies and local star - burst galaxies ( e.g.   martin 2005 ; keel 2005 ) .",
    "if such winds can escape from the potential well , they can carry metals to large distances from the galaxy and deposit large amounts of energy in the intergalactic medium .",
    "these winds thus have important consequences for the metal enrichment of the universe ( aguire et al .  2001 ) and galaxy formation models ( benson et al .  2003 ) .",
    "the key issue , however , is whether the wind material is localised within individual hii regions ( in which case , it may not escape the galaxy potential ) , or whether the expelled shell already envelops the complete galaxy .",
    "the latter interpretation is supported by adelberger et al.s ( 2003 ) observation of a small scale anti - correlation between galaxies and ly@xmath0 absorption in qso spectra ( although as those authors quote , the statistical significance of this result is modest ) .",
    "if it can be demonstrated that the superwind shell had already escaped from the galaxy disk , then it may have enough energy to escape the gravitational potential to distribute its energy metals widely across the universe .",
    "to distinguishing between these scenarios , we must examine the spatial variation of the velocity offset between h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 .",
    "our data show no correlation between the emission wavelength of ly@xmath0 and the velocity variations clearly seen in h@xmath0 .",
    "this argues that the ly@xmath0 emission originates outside the individual components .",
    "if we were seeing the inner surface of a shell located well outside the galaxy we would expect a negligible velocity shear and indeed our observations place a limit on the shear of @xmath85 .",
    "we can also investigate how closely the morphology of the ly@xmath0 emission traces the star - forming regions of the galaxy . while the ly@xmath0 intensity map generally traces the @xmath52-band morphology , the diffuse extension labelled _ d _ in fig .  1",
    ", has no counterpart in the @xmath52-band image .",
    "this component may be a dense knot in an outflowing shell and would be compatible with a model in which scattered ly@xmath0 photons are observed from the outflowing shell .",
    "the data presesnted here support that idea that we are seeing wind material that has already escaped from the galaxy .",
    "it is interesting to compare the velocity offset in ly@xmath0 with the escape velocity of the galaxy . using the dynamical mass estimate ( @xmath86 ) enclosed in a radius of @xmath18kpc we estimate escape velocity to be @xmath87 ( assuming a central concentration of @xmath88 for @xmath12 ) ; ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) .",
    "whilst this escape velocity exceeds that of the outflowing material , the fate of the outflow will depend on its present location ( or equivalently , its initial velocity ) .",
    "for example , if the outflow originated in the galaxy with an initial speed of @xmath89 , then it will surely rain back down on the galaxy .",
    "however , if , as we have argued , the shell is currently located outside the galaxy ( i.e.   @xmath7710kpc ) , then the escape velocity will be a factor of @xmath90 less , in which case the outflow will probably escape the gravitational potential and distribute the gas much more widely in the environment .",
    "we also note that the uv - bright starburst in n2 850.4 is still relatively young ( @xmath110myr ; smail et al .",
    "2003 ) and therefore this material may still be accelerating into the inter - galactic medium .",
    "future observations of a larger sample of these galaxies ( at various evolutionary stages ) may yield further information about the origin of the outflows and the size of the regions which they affect around them ( geach et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "our observations suggest that the vigorous activity in n2 850.4 is arising due to an interaction between at least two distinct components .",
    "one of these contains warm , dense molecular gas and hosts and agn , while the second appeard to be less massive , but still contains substantial amounts of cold gas .",
    "the resulting gravitational tides resulted in a starburst and ( actively fuelled ) agn activity .",
    "this activity has produced a wind that maybe driving enriched gas out into the inter - galactic medium . whilst these observations are based on a single galaxy ,",
    "our results clearly show the power of combining optical and near - infrared observations to probe the power sources , masses and feedback processes in high redshift , far - infrared luminous selected galaxies . the next step is to generate a statistically useful sample to gauge the prevalence outflows from these massive galaxies which may explain the processes which shape the galaxy luminosity function and explain why only 10% of baryons cool to form stars .",
    "we are very greatful to the referee , seb oliver for his constructive report which significantly improved the content and layout of this paper .",
