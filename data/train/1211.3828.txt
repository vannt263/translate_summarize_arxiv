    "-density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes @xcite have been one of dominant error - correcting codes for high - speed communication systems or data storage systems because they asymptotically have capacity - approaching performance under iterative decoding with moderate complexity . among them , quasi - cyclic ( qc ) ldpc codes are well suited for hardware implementation using simple shift registers due to the regularity in their parity - check matrices so that they have been adopted in many practical applications .    for a high - rate case",
    ", it is difficult to randomly construct good ldpc codes of short and moderate lengths because their parity - check matrices are so dense compared to a low - rate case for the given code length and degree distribution that they are prone to making short cycles . among well - known structured ldpc codes , finite geometry ldpc codes @xcite-@xcite and ldpc codes constructed from combinatorial designs @xcite-@xcite are adequate for high - rate ldpc codes .",
    "the error correcting performance of these ldpc codes is verified under proper decoding algorithms but they have severe restrictions on flexibly choosing the code rate and length . also , since finite geometry ldpc codes usually have much redundancy and large weights in their parity - check matrices , they are not suitable for a strictly power - constrained system with iterative message - passing decoding",
    ".    it is known that the parity - check matrix structure consisting of a single row of circulants @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite is adequate for generating high - rate qc ldpc codes of short and moderate lengths .",
    "the class - i circulant eg - ldpc codes in @xcite and the duals of one - generator qc codes in @xcite are constructed from the euclidean geometry and the affine geometry , respectively , and they have very restricted rates and lengths and much redundancy . in @xcite-@xcite , qc ldpc codes constructed from cyclic difference families ( cdfs ) @xcite are proposed , which also have restricted lengths .",
    "computer search algorithms are proposed in @xcite and @xcite for various - length qc ldpc codes of this parity - check matrix structure , but they can not generate qc ldpc codes as short as the qc ldpc codes constructed from cdfs for most of code rates .    in this paper , new high - rate regular qc ldpc codes with parity - check matrices consisting of a single row of circulants with the column - weight 3 or 4 are proposed based on special classes of cdfs . in designing the proposed qc ldpc codes , we can flexibly choose the code rate and length including the minimum achievable code length for a given design rate .",
    "the parity - check matrices of the proposed qc ldpc codes have full rank when the column - weight is 3 and have almost full rank when the column - weight is 4 because there is just one redundant row .",
    "numerical analysis shows that the error correcting performance of the proposed qc ldpc codes of short and moderate lengths is almost the same as that of the existing high - rate qc ldpc codes .",

    "note that for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath119 , a forward difference and a backward difference over @xmath107 of the shift values in the proposed qc ldpc codes have @xmath117 in common .",

    "therefore , there is no shift value assignment such that the parity - check matrix in ( [ eq : h ] ) avoids cycles of length 4 for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath119 .",
    "the proposed qc ldpc codes have advantages mainly on being able to have various code parameters while guaranteeing the girth 6 . for @xmath92",
    ", @xmath85 only has to be larger than or equal to 2 and for @xmath89 , @xmath85 can be any integer from 4 to 1000 , which are the same as the conventional qc ldpc codes constructed from cdfs @xcite-@xcite except for @xmath89 and @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , for a fixed @xmath85 , @xmath68 can have any value as long as @xmath90 except for the case of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath119 . on the other hand",
    ", the conventional qc ldpc codes constructed from cdfs generally do not guarantee the girth 6 for @xmath129 for a given @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , it can be easily seen that @xmath68 can have the arbitrary value from @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the conventional qc ldpc codes to have the girth 6 because for the given cdf @xmath61 , @xmath79 , the conventional qc ldpc codes can be constructed by only using the sets @xmath132 for @xmath133 . however , the conventional qc ldpc codes can not still have sufficiently various code lengths .",
    "it is obvious that the proposed qc ldpc codes can achieve the minimum code length , which corresponds to the theoretical lower bound , among all possible regular ldpc codes for given @xmath74 and design rate under the girth 6 is guaranteed because the parity - check matrix of the proposed qc ldpc code with @xmath134 is actually an incidence matrix of a steiner system @xcite , @xcite .",
    "that is , the minimum achievable code length of the proposed qc ldpc codes is @xmath135 . for comparison ,",
    "consider qc ldpc codes whose parity - check matrices have the form of a @xmath136 array of @xmath137 circulant permutation matrices , which correspond to the most common form of the existing regular qc ldpc codes . obviously ,",
    "these qc ldpc codes have the same design rate , row- and column - weights of the parity - check matrices with the proposed qc ldpc codes . the necessary condition on @xmath138 for these qc ldpc codes to have the girth larger than or equal to 6 is @xmath139 @xcite and the array ldpc codes @xcite are known to achieve the equality @xcite .",
    "thus , the minimum achievable code length of these qc ldpc codes for guaranteeing the girth 6 is @xmath140 . fig .",
    "[ fig : min_length ] illustrates such minimum achievable code lengths @xmath141 and @xmath142 by varying @xmath85 for @xmath92 and @xmath34 and we can see that the proposed qc ldpc codes can flexibly have a very short length up to the theoretical lower bound unlike the array ldpc codes . note that qc ldpc codes in @xcite and @xcite can not achieve the minimum code length .",
    "the error correcting performance of the proposed qc ldpc codes may not be good for @xmath68 much larger than @xmath143 because , regardless of the code length , the girth of the proposed qc ldpc codes is fixed to 6 and the minimum distance of these qc ldpc codes has a value between @xmath144 and @xmath145 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , these restrictions on the girth and the minimum distance are not problematic for the proposed high - rate short qc ldpc codes and for large @xmath85 and small @xmath68 , the error correcting performance of the proposed qc ldpc codes will be compared with that of other qc ldpc codes in section [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "therefore , the proposed construction is adequate for high - rate qc ldpc codes of short and moderate lengths .",
    "it is difficult to analyze the rank of the parity - check matrices of the proposed qc ldpc codes because they do not have an algebraic structure like the codes in @xcite-@xcite . instead",
    ", the rank of the proposed parity - check matrices for various parameters can be numerically computed .",
    "it is observed that the parity - check matrices of the proposed qc ldpc codes have full rank for the parameters @xmath92 , @xmath146 , and @xmath68 such that the code length is less than or equal to 3,000 , and have almost full rank , i.e. , just one redundant row , for the parameters @xmath89 , @xmath147 , and @xmath68 such that the code length is less than or equal to 3,000 .",
    "moreover , every parity - check matrix has at least one full - rank circulant for @xmath92 , which enables a simple encoding of the proposed qc ldpc codes , and has at least one almost full - rank circulant for @xmath89 .",
    "assume that @xmath148 in ( [ eq : h ] ) is invertible .",
    "then , a generator matrix @xmath149 of systematic form is simply obtained @xcite as @xmath150 where @xmath151 represents the @xmath152 identity matrix .",
    "this full - rank property of the parity - check matrices differentiates the proposed qc ldpc codes from the qc ldpc codes in @xcite and @xcite , whose parity - check matrices consist of a single row of circulants and have many redundant rows .",
    "in this section , the error correcting performance of the proposed qc ldpc codes is verified via numerical analysis and compared with that of some algebraic qc ldpc codes and progressive edge - growth ( peg ) ldpc codes @xcite with girth 6 . as algebraic qc ldpc codes , affine geometry qc ldpc codes @xcite and array ldpc codes @xcite are used .",
