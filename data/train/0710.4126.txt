    "two scenarios were discussed@xcite to explain the observed pressure - induced excitations inside the mott - hubbard gap of tiocl : a bandwidth - controlled insulator - to - metal transition , i.e. , a mott transition of purely electronic character,@xcite and a structural phase transition entering a metallic phase . to clarify this issue , we carried out x - ray powder diffraction experiments as a function of pressure .",
    "[ fig : x - ray - tiobr ] shows the room - temperature diffraction diagrams of tiobr for selected pressures together with the lebail fits .",

    "we could therefore obtain the lattice parameters and unit cell volume as a function of pressure.@xcite the most important finding , however , is that the diffraction diagram undergoes pronounced changes at around 14  gpa and is no longer compatible with the ambient - pressure crystal structure symmetry .",
    "these drastic changes in the diffraction data related to a structural phase transition coincide with the changes in the optical properties described above .",
    "corresponding results are found for the analog compound tiocl.@xcite this points out that for a proper description of the pressure - induced transition in tiobr and tiocl the lattice degree of freedom has to be taken into account besides correlation effects in the electronic subsystem .",
    "in conclusion , we studied the pressure dependence of the polarization - dependent optical response of the low - dimensional mott - hubbard insulater tiobr in the infrared and visible frequency range at room temperature .",
    "the most interesting effects induced by pressure are the suppression of the transmittance and the increase in the reflectance above a critical pressure , suggesting the occurrence of an insulator - to - metal transition .",
    "the metallization of tiobr at high pressure is evidenced by the finite optical conductivity in the far - infrared frequency range , which includes a drude term . according to our pressure - dependent x - ray powder diffraction results , the pressure - induced insulator - to - metal transition coincides with a structural phase transition for pressures around 14  gpa under hydrostatic conditions .",
