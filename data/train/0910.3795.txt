    "due to large computational costs , @xmath1 , @xmath2 quark mass in current lattice qcd simulations is heavier than the physical value .",
    "one then has to extrapolate results obtained at heavier quark mass to those at the physical point , using some formula such as chiral perturbation theory(chpt ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether chpt can be applied at rather heavy quark masses employed so far in lattice qcd simulations .",
    "this situation is gradually changing , thanks to improvements for both computers and algorithms . indeed",
    "the first important message from the annual lattice conference of this year , lattice 2008 , is that full qcd simulations near the physical light quark mass becomes possible .    in table[tab :",
    "full_qcd ] , parameters such as number of flavors , the lattice spacing @xmath3 , the spatial extension of the lattice @xmath4 , the minimum pion mass @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are listed for recent large scale full qcd simulations . in the left half of the list , the conventional quark action such as the wilson quark action or the staggered quark action is employed for simulations , while the chirally symmetric quark action such as the overlap quark action or the domain - wall quark action is used in the right half .",
    "let me point out here that the minimum pion mass in the full qcd simulations now becomes below 200 mev for conventional actions and close to 300 mev for chirally symmetric actions , though finite size effects could be sizable in some cases where @xmath7 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     results for hadron spectrum from one of the most extensive calculations have been reported in ref.@xcite , where both chiral and continuum extrapolations have been performed . in this calculation , the minimum pion mass @xmath8 mev is light enough , and @xmath9 is always satisfied . in fig.[fig : spectrum ] , the hadron spectrum obtained in the continuum limit is compared with experiment . here",
    "the overall scale , the light quark mass and the strange quark mass are fixed by @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . as can be seen from the figure , the agreement between lattice qcd and experiment is excellent .",
    ", @xmath12 and @xmath10 are used as inputs to fix free parameters of qcd.,width=207 ]    it is also reported recently that the pion mass can be smaller than 160 mev in the 2 + 1 flavor full qcd simulation at @xmath13 fm@xcite . in fig .",

    "note however that @xmath15 in this calculation , so that the finite size effect might be sizable at the lightest quark mass . to reduce the magnitude of the finite size effect less than a % level , gauge configurations at @xmath16 fm with @xmath17 mev corresponding @xmath18 are currently accumulated by this group .",

    "the first positive statement can be established by both 2-flavor full qcd simulations with the small enough quark mass and use of chirally symmetric quark such as overlap or domain - wall quark .",
    "the second negative statement has been concluded from analyses in 2 + 1 flavor full qcd simulations . as a consequence su(2 ) chpt analysis is applied even to data in 2 + 1 flavor qcd .    in fig.[fig : chpt ] @xmath23(top - left ) and @xmath24(bottom - left ) are plotted as function of the quark mass @xmath25 with the 2-flavor overlap fermion at @xmath26 fm@xcite .",

    "differences among these three choices are higher order of chpt in eq.([eq : chpt ] ) . the fact that all three fits work reasonably well at @xmath28 mev establishes the validity of the nlo su(2 )",
    "chpt at @xmath33 mev .",
    "it is also shown in ref.@xcite that all data points up to the one at @xmath34 mev can be fitted by the nnlo formula of the chpt with @xmath35 ,",
    "whose nlo fit well describes data even beyond the fitted range .",
    "the convergence behaviour of the chiral expansion is also plotted for @xmath23(top - right ) and @xmath24(bottom - right ) in fig.[fig : chpt ] , which shows , for example , that the nlo contribution is a -10% ( + 28% ) level for @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) at @xmath36 mev , while the nnlo correction gives about + 3%(18% ) .",
    "although the chiral expansion is at least convergent for both quantities , the nnlo contribution for @xmath24 becomes significant already at @xmath36 mev , corresponding to the @xmath37 meson mass region for the 3 flavor case .    in the 2 + 1 flavor full qcd simulations with the domain - wall quark , it is reported@xcite that the nlo su(3 ) ( partially quenched ) chpt can not explain the quark mass dependence of mass and decay constant in the pseudo - scalar meson sector around the physical strange quark mass region .",
    "instead the formula in the nlo su(2 ) chpt plus the heavy strange quark theory works better even for these data in the 2 + 1 flavor full qcd .",

    "one of possible solutions to this problem recently investigated is qcd with fixed topological charge .",
    "for example , the two point function between flavor singlet pseudo - scalar densities @xmath41 at fixed topological charge @xmath42 behaves at large separation as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the space - time volume , @xmath45 is the quark mass , @xmath46 is the expectation values at fixed @xmath42 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the topological susceptibility and the 4-th cumulant defined in the ordinary qcd at @xmath49 .",
    "this formula tells us that one can extract informations about qcd at @xmath49 such as @xmath50 or @xmath51 from behaviours of correlation functions calculated at fixed @xmath42 .",
    "this strategy is suitable for lattice qcd since it is easier to fix the topological charge @xmath42 than to change it correctly during simulations , in particular , at small quark mass and/or near the continuum limit .",
    "the jlqcd has taken this strategy for the dynamical overlap project , where the fixed topology not only guarantees the locality of the overlap dirac operator but also makes full qcd simulations with overlap quarks much faster . in fig.[fig : chi_t ] , the topological susceptibility @xmath50 extracted from eq.([eq : chi_t ] ) at @xmath52 is plotted as a function of the light quark mass @xmath53 for 2 flavor@xcite and 2 + 1 flavor@xcite qcd .",
    "the results show a clear linear dependence on the sea quark mass expected from the chpt as @xmath54 for 2 flavor and @xmath55 for 2 + 1 flavor , where @xmath56 is the chiral condensate at massless limit and @xmath57 is the ( fixed ) strange quark mass .",

    "it has been shown that the zero - viscosity ( perfect ) hydro calculations explain the rhic experimental results well .",
    "this indicates that in heavy - ion collision , after thermalization , the system expands and cools with constant entropy . in this case ,",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) along the line of the constant entropy per baryon number , called the isentropic eos , becomes more relevant than the ordinary eos as a function of temperature at the fixed chemical potential @xmath64 .",
    "the entropy per baryon number , @xmath65 is roughly equal to 300 at rhic , 45 at sps and 30 at ags .",
    "the lattice qcd at non - zero chemical potential , however , is notoriously difficult to be simulated .",
    "so far there is no established method to simulate the full qcd at arbitrary value of the chemical potential @xmath64 .",
    "if the chemical potential is small , the taylor expansion in terms of @xmath64 works well@xcite .",

    "the reweighting method , which looked promising on small volumes , may not be reliable to answer these questions@xcite . a new method appears@xcite , but we have to wait for a while , in order to see whether the method indeed works for this problem .",
    "one established method to investigate the existence of the critical end point is the imaginary chemical potential method , which i will discuss in this subsection .    at a given chemical potential @xmath64 in 2 + 1 flavor qcd with the fixed strange quark mass @xmath57",
