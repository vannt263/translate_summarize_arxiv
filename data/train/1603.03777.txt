    "there are two methods of determining the dimensionless black hole spin parameter , @xmath5 , in x - ray binaries .",

    "both methods have been used successfully in several x - ray binaries ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however the results are not always consistent between the two @xcite .",
    "some of this discrepancy can be attributed to the difficulty of using both methods simultaneously , because they rely on being able to measure different spectral components .",
    "the optimal state for measuring the iron line may not be optimal for measuring the disk spectrum , and vice versa .",
    "a second difficulty arises from pile - up , which can potentially introduce large uncertainties , the extent of which are difficult to establish , and can lead to conflicting results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "has a triggered read - out , meaning that it does not suffer from pile - up when looking at bright sources ( pile - up occurs when two or more photons arrive close together and are read as a single event ) .",
    "_ nustar _  thus allows for reliable , sensitive , low background spectroscopy from 379  kev , covering both the iron line and compton hump from x - ray reflection .",
    "this has enabled precision measurements of the reflection parameters in several x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "gx  339 - 4 is a well known transient x - ray binary .",
    "it was discovered in 1973 by @xcite , who noted that it changed by a factor of @xmath7 in flux over a year .",
    "it has since been studied extensively , as it is a very bright source and frequently undergoes outbursts .",
    "there have been several attempts to measure the spin in gx  339 - 4 .",
    "@xcite used _ xmm - newton _  and _ rxte _ , and the _ chandra _  hetgs , to measure a relativistically broadened iron line . from the _",

    "@xcite use the same _ suzaku _  data as @xcite , excising more of the core of the psf to further limit the effects of pile - up , and find that the line appears narrower when more data are excluded . from this",
    ", they infer that the broadening of the line is due to pile - up , and that gx  339 - 4 need not be rapidly spinning ( although their measurements are still consistent with maximal spin at the 90% confidence level ) .",
    "@xcite use continuum fitting and physical arguments based on the inclination and distance of the binary system to argue that the spin must be less than 0.9 .",
    "most recently , @xcite re - analyse the data from @xcite and @xcite and find @xmath12 , and @xcite find @xmath13 from stacked rxte data .",
    "the inclination of the gx  339 - 4 binary system is only weakly constrained by dynamic measurements .",
    "as the system is non - eclipsing , the inclination must be less than 60  @xcite , and a plausible lower limit of @xmath14  is given from the mass function @xcite .",
    "however , measurements of the inner disk inclination from the broad iron line generally give lower values .",
    "@xcite find @xmath15@xmath16 ; @xcite find @xmath17@xmath2 ; and @xcite find @xmath18@xmath19 . @xcite use a combined spectroscopy and timing analysis to find @xmath20 , fitting both the lag and spectral data .",
    "more recently , @xcite used five hard state observations from the failed outburst in 2013 to constrain the reflection spectrum , finding inclinations ranging from 31  to 59 , depending on the model .",

    "we tie the high energy cutoff of the reflection spectrum to twice the plasma temperature of _ comptt _ @xcite .",

    "this differs from the conventional continuum fitting procedure , where the mass , distance , and inclination parameters are fixed and used to constrain the spin .",

    "the data used in this work is some of the highest quality ever taken of gx  339 - 4 , with higher spectral resolution than _ rxte _ , and none of the issues arising from pile - up that affect _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra_. we find a high spin value ( @xmath0 ) and a low inclination ( @xmath1@xmath2 ) from reflection fitting .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we have been able to constrain the mass and distance of gx  339 - 4 using just the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the mass and distance are strongly correlated ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_mandd ] ) , but not so degenerate that a meaningful constraint can not be obtained .",
    "we are able to constrain multiple parameters ( either @xmath37 and @xmath38 or @xmath5 and @xmath40 ) using continuum fitting because of the exceptional quality of the _ nustar",
    "_  data covering the high energy side of the disk spectrum .",
    "the _ kerrbb _",
    "model is significantly contributing flux in the _ nustar _",
    "band up to 10  kev , and dominates the emission until @xmath44  kev .",

    "nustar _  allows us to measure multiple parameters with precision .",
    "there are various systematic effects that may impact both the reflection and continuum fitting methods .",
    "we have assumed a colour - correction factor of 1.7 for _",
    "kerrbb_. we test two additional values , f=1.5 and 1.9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and find masses of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , and distances of @xmath47  kpc and @xmath48  kpc .",
    "this represents a systematic error of @xmath3612  @xmath49 in mass and @xmath50  kpc in distance .",
    "the continuum method is only valid when the source is accreting below @xmath51% of the eddington limit . due to the uncertainty in @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",
    "this is hard to be certain of , but based on the x - ray luminosity we find that this condition is met when @xmath52 .",
    "this condition is met for the majority of the parameter space concerned ( including the estimate of * ? ? ? * and our estimate , see fig .",
    "[ fig_mandd ] ) .",
    "additionally , the continuum fitting method is only valid when the fraction of disk photons that are compton scattered is @xmath53 @xcite . in this case",
    ", the fraction is @xmath54 , and is not affected by mass or distance .",
    "we rely heavily on measurements of the spectral shape of the disk at high energies with _ nustar _  to constrain multiple parameters from continuum fitting .",
    "while the sensitivity of _ nustar _  means that the disk is detectable up to @xmath34  kev , the fraction of flux it contributes is low above 5  kev due to the steep spectral shape .",
    "this means that small differences in the dominant comptonization component can potentially have a large impact on the measured parameters .",
    "to test this , we re - fit the data in the same way using the alternative comptonization models _ nthcomp _",
    "@xcite , _ compps _",
    "@xcite , and _ eqpair _ @xcite .",
    "we find masses of @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , respectively , and distances of @xmath58  kpc , @xmath59  kpc , and @xmath60  kpc . ] . taking the standard deviation of these measurements ( including the original with _ comptt _ ) as an estimate of the systematic error gives @xmath61 in mass and @xmath62  kpc in distance .",
    "a final systematic issue affecting the continuum method is conserving the number of compton scattered photons from the disk .",
    "we are unable to find an acceptable fit using the _ simpl _ model @xcite , due to its lack of spectral curvature needed for the _ nustar _  spectrum . in one case out of six considered by @xcite ,",
    "_ comptt _ underpredicts the inner radius of the disk by 0.5  @xmath63 relative to _ simpl_. translating this to spin ( at the best fit value from reflection ) gives a conservative systematic error of @xmath64 , which is comparable to the statistical error on spin and therefore will not have a large effect on our results . in general , the choice of hard component model may have a systematic effect on the results from continuum modelling , particularly with _ nustar _  data where much of the signal is at high energies .",
    "we confirm the difference in @xmath31 between the reflection and continuum spectra found by @xcite , finding @xmath65 for the reflection and @xmath66 for the continuum ( calculated by replacing the comptonized continuum with a cut - off power - law , and ignoring the data below 3  kev where @xmath67 turns over and can not be replicated with a power - law ) .",
    "these measurements are inconsistent at @xmath68 , and the difference is similar in size to that found by @xcite .",
    "we are unable to find a good fit when @xmath31 is fixed between the two spectral components .",
    "there are several potential reasons for this , but perhaps the most likely is systematic effects in the reflection modelling .",
    "there are several secondary effects that could affect the broad - band shape of the reflection spectrum , altering @xmath31 , the iron abundance , and cut - off energy .",
    "the assumed density of the latest generation of reflection models is @xmath69  @xmath70 , which is appropriate for agn but should be orders of magnitude larger in xrbs .",
    "standard reflection models do not include a variable low energy cut - off , and so overpredict the flux at low energies , which may cause the slope to become harder to compensate .",
    "a further point to consider is the impact of the thermal emission from the disk on the total reflection spectrum .",
    "there have been models which include this in the past @xcite , but these include the contribution from the black body in the reflection spectrum , so are unsuitable for use with kerrbb .",
    "we can not say definitively whether the difference in @xmath31 is real or due to systematic effects , but it should be possible to determine with more sophisticated modelling .",
    "we do not expect any of these effects to strongly impact the shape of the line profile , so our results on the spin and inclination should be robust . if the difference in @xmath31 is real , it is likely due to the geometry of the corona . in particular , outflowing coronal models predict that different @xmath31 values would be seen by the disk and observers at infinity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
