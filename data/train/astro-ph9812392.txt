    "this remarkably broad soft x - ray spectral index distribution appears not to be at random , but rather it is strongly correlated with other important optical and x - ray properties of these objects .",
    "objects with narrower h@xmath3 ( @xmath4 fwhm@xmath5 km s@xmath6 ) and smaller [ oiii]/h@xmath3 ( @xmath7 ) ratio are systematically steeper in soft x - rays ( @xmath8 ) than agn with broad ( fwhm@xmath9 km s@xmath6 ) permitted lines and greater [ oiii]/h @xmath3 ratio ( @xmath10[oiii]/h@xmath11 , @xmath12 ) . in particular most of the so called narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nlsy1 ) show a steep 0.2 - 2 kev continuum ( boller et al 1996 ) . in the 210 kev energy range",
    "narrow optical emission line quasars have still a somewhat steeper spectrum compared to broad optical emission line quasars .",
    "the spread of the 2 - 10 kev spectral index is however smaller than that of the 0.1 - 2 kev , pspc one ( brandt et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that these properties are correlated with the accretion rate ( pounds et al 1995 , laor et al 1997 , fiore et al 1998a , b ) .",
    "ionized gas , modifying the agn x - ray spectrum , has been detected in about half of the bright , x - ray flat , broad optical emission line type 1 agn studied by asca ( reynolds , 1997 , george , 1998 ) .",
    "the main features imprinted by the ionized gas on the x - ray spectrum are the ovii and oviii k absorption edges at 0.74 and 0.87 kev . * as already pointed out by george et al .",

    "( 1998 ) samples implies that warm absorbers in agn have all roughly similar ionization structure , despite of the broad range of ionizing luminosity ( i.e. about 3 orders of magnitude , from @xmath13 to @xmath14 erg s@xmath6 ) . * in terms of the ionization parameter u , the presence in the gas of he - like and h - like ions of c , o and",
    "ne as dominant ionic species , implies a narrow range of logu=0.5 - 1.5 ( nicastro et al , 1998a ) .",
    "this is consistent with the location of the warm gas at radii scaling with the root square of the luminosity .",
    "the column densities of the reynolds sample are distributed in the range log@xmath15=21 - 23 , but the standard deviation of the distribution is rather small , @xmath16 , again indicating a relative uniformity in the physical properties of this agn component . several type 1 agn showing ionized absorption features in x - ray also show high ionization uv absorption lines ( namely ovi , nv , civ , ciii ] ) , over - imposed to the broad emission lines and systematically blue - shifted with respect to them ( mathur et al . , 1994 , 1995 , 1998 ) . * the widths of these absorption lines are tipically much broader than the associated thermal broadening , suggesting turbulence velocities of the absorber . *",
    "the uv and the x - ray absorbers have ionization states compatible with each other , which supports the identification of these two components ( mathur et al .",
    ", 1994 , 1995 , 1997 , 1998 ) . * in one of these cases ( the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  3516 ) the total column density implied by some strong uv absorption lines is larger than that required by the x - ray absorption features ( kriss et al .",
    ", 1996a , b ) .",
    "however it is well possible that more than one kinematic components contribute to the total intensity and equivalent width of the uv lines and that only one of those is physically associated with the x - ray absorber ( mathur et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "* the uv absorption lines may be produced in a turbulent outflowing wind intercepting the line of sight ( possibly driven out by radiative acceleration ) .",
    "the outflowing velocities of the uv warm gas span the range",
    "@xmath17 km s@xmath6 ( mathur et al . 1994 , 1995 , 1997 ) , and a similar range has been estimated for the dispersion velocities @xmath18 along the line of sight .    on the other hand , deep absorption features at the energies of the k edges of high ionized oxygen have never been observed in the 0.1 - 2 kev spectra of soft x - ray steep spectrum , narrow optical emission line type 1 agn .",

    "during the asca ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) and bepposax ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) observations the two sources have a rather flat x - ray continuum ( @xmath19 ) and therefore can not be considered x - ray steep agns .",

    "matt ( 1994 ) and krolik & kriss ( 1995 ) were the first to point out the importance of x  ray resonant absorption lines in ionized absorbers .",
    "here we calculate in detail photoionization models , including all the relevant resonant absorption lines , and study the dependence of the transmitted spectrum on the exact shape of the ionizing continuum .",
    "we find that the phenomenologies observed in both broad optical emission lines type 1 agn and nlsy1 galaxies can be explained in terms of their quite different ionizing continua , provided that , for a given luminosity , the radial distance of the gas clouds from the ionizing source ( in units of gravitational radii ) and the gas density are similar in both classes of objetcs .",
    "netzer ( 1993 , 1996 ) discussed the relevance of recombination and fluorescent emission lines , provided that the covering factor of the ionized matter is significant , while krolik & kriss ( 1995 ) and matt , brandt & fabian ( 1996 ) pointed out that resonant scattering lines can be even more intense . here ,",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we do not consider any line emission , and therefore our model is strictly valid only if the covering factor is negligible ( see next section ) .",

    "we finally present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we calculated the curves of growth of all the 268 permitted resonant absorption lines of c , o , ne , mg , si , s and fe , in the 0.110 kev energy range , with oscillator strengths greater than 0.05 . * we used atomic data from the complete list of permitted ls - type ( ls coupling transitions ) resonant lines of all ionization states of 18 elements tabulated in verner et al .",
    "intercombination and forbidden lines are not included in that compilation .",
    "* we carried out the calculations considering the exact voigt profile for the lines , i.e. considering both doppler and natural broadening .",
    "as suggested by the width of the absorption lines detected in the uv spectra of the uv / x - ray ionized absorbers ( mathur et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 , 1997 , 1998 ) , in addition to the thermal doppler broadening we consider here a term accounting for gas turbulence , and refer to this term as the `` turbulence velocity '' @xmath30 along the line of sight .",
    "we calculated spectra emerging from photoionized gas for a number of values of n@xmath31 , u , and @xmath30 .",
    "relative ionic abundances and edge - like absorption features for given u and n@xmath31 and for a particular shape of the nuclear ionizing continuum are those calculated by cloudy ( ferland , 1997 , vs 90.04 ) , while the intensity and profile of the resonance absorption lines are consistently computed here for a given value of @xmath30 .",
    "the result is an emerging spectrum including both absorption edges and lines .",
    "we considered only line absorption , not emission .",
    "* we used cloudy ( vs 90.04 , ferland , 1997 ) to build total ( transmitted + emitted ) spectra and verified that , for the range of total column densities and ionization parameters considered here , this assumption corresponds ( for a spherical configuration ) to covering factors @xmath32 ( in good agreement with the netzer , 1993 , results : see his fig .",
    "3 ) . in an ideal optically thin case",
    ", in which ( a ) the ionized gas isotropically and uniformely covers the central source ( @xmath33 ) , ( b ) any systematic ( inflowing or outflowing ) motion of the gas is absent , and ( c ) any line destruction mechanism ( autoionization , compton scattering , photoabsorption ) is inefficient , then scattering of the resonant emission line photons in the line of sight would exactly compensate for the line absorption along the line of sight , and , according to netzer ( 1996 ) , only emission features ( mainly recombination lines ) would be present in the total spectra .",
    "any deviation from the above ideal condition would produce net absorption lines , which can therefore diagnose the physical and geometrical conditions of the absorbing material .",
    "* presence of outflows instead would imply that both emission and absorption lines are present in the emergent spectra , with the absorption lines blueshifted with respect to the emission ones . in this paper , however , for the sake of simplicity we assume that a cloud of gas with negligible covering factor * ( @xmath32 ) * is completely obscuring the line of sight , and therefore that the contribution from emission lines to the overall spectrum is negligible .",
    "in comparing our model with real spectra it must be taken in mind that absorption lines may be partly compensated by line scattering * and recombination lines * for significant covering factors , or that emission lines may appear redwards ( bluewards ) of the absorption lines if the matter is outflowing ( inflowing ) .    in the next paragraph",
    "we present the details of the computation , and show some examples of both growth curves and emerging spectra .",
    "the equivalent width of a resonant absorption line is : @xmath34 d\\nu,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the dimensionless specific optical depth of the considered transition : @xmath36 in the above equation @xmath37 is the absorption coefficient at the frequency @xmath38 in cm@xmath6 , @xmath40 is the number density of ions of the given element which populate the * l*ower level in the unit volume ( in @xmath41 ) , l is the linear dimension of the cloud of gas along the line of sight ( in cm ) , @xmath42 is the oscillator strength of the electron transition from the * l*ower to the * u*pper level , m is the electron mass in g , and @xmath43 is the normalized voigt profile . with these units the equivalent width in equation ( [ ew ] )",
    "the voigt profile can be written as ( e.g. rybicky & lightman 1979 ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the voigt function : @xmath46 in equation ( [ voigtfun ] ) @xmath47 is essentially the ratio between the natural and the doppler line widths @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . for small values of @xmath47 the center of the line is dominated by the doppler profile , while the wings are dominated by the lorentzian profile . as is well known",
    ", this influences the growth curves making them increasing with n@xmath31 even over the core saturation .",
    "we consider two different contributions to the doppler profile : ( a ) the thermal motion of the ions , and ( b ) the dispersion velocity @xmath30 of the gas along the line of sight : @xmath51 let us estimate the relative contribution of the two terms in equation ( [ dopplerwidth ] ) : @xmath52{2 k t } } \\over   { \\sqrt[2]{m } \\sigma_v } } \\simeq 1.3 { { ( t)_6^{0.5 } a^{-0.5 } } \\over   { ( \\sigma_v)_{100}}}.\\ ] ] in equation ( [ thermturb ] ) @xmath53 is the equilibrium temperature of the gas in units of @xmath54 k , @xmath55 is the dispersion velocity in units of 100 km s@xmath6 , and a is the atomic weight of the considered element . for a highly ionized gas in photoionization equilibrium , the temperature spans the range @xmath56 . in a such a gas",
    "the elements lighter than o - ne are usually fully stripped ( the threshold element over which bound ions are still present depending strongly on the photoionizing continuum shape ) , and so the residual opacity from both bound  free and bound - bound transitions is mainly due to the heavy elements ( from o to fe ) .",
    "assuming therefore @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and a=16 ( the atomic weight of the lightest non - fully stripped element ) , we get , from equation ( [ thermturb ] ) , @xmath59 . for the iron ions ( a=56 )",
    "we would find @xmath60 .",
    "hence , for dispersion velocities of @xmath26 km s@xmath6 , the contribution of the thermal motion of the ions to the broadening of the absorption line is only @xmath61 of the total , and it decreases linearly with increasing @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the second term in equation ( [ dopplerwidth ] ) is the dominant one for @xmath62 .",
    "fig 1 and 2 show the growth curves of the k@xmath63 and k@xmath3 lines of h - like and he - like c , o , ne and fe , for ( a ) @xmath64 ( doppler broadening entirely due to the thermal motion of the ions ) , and ( b ) @xmath65 km s@xmath6 respectively .",
    "the equivalent widths of the two k@xmath63 lines of h - like ions have been summed to give a single equivalent width for the doublet .",
    "the ionization state of the absorbing gas is that of a typical flat x - ray spectrum , broad optical emission line type 1 agn warm absorber ( logu=1 ) for c , o , and ne , while a much higher ionization case ( logu=3 ) is adopted for the fexxv and fexxvi lines . in both cases",
    "the ionizing continuum used is the agn spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , tabulated in cloudy ( ferland , 1997 , vs. 90.04 ) .",
    "however , we stress that the growth curves depend only on the relative abundance of the ion under investigations , and not on the particular combination of u and shape of the ionizing continuum producing this abundance .    at low column densities ( @xmath66 @xmath24 : the exact value depending on the considered line and dispersion velocity ) , the equivalent width of each line increases linearly with n@xmath31 . for higher values of",
    "n@xmath31 the optical depth of the line core saturates and the lorentzian profile begins to drive the further slower growth of the equivalent width with increasing columns .",
    "the linear branch of the growth curves ( the low column density limit ) is described by equation ( [ ew ] ) in the limit @xmath67 : @xmath68 let us define @xmath69 , @xmath70 and n@xmath31 as the abundance of the element x relatively to the h abundance , the relative abundance of the ion @xmath71 of the element x , and the equivalent hydrogen column density along the line of sight respectively .",
    "with these positions and introducing an appropriate numerical format we have :    @xmath72    when the core of the line becomes opaque to the radiation , equation ( [ ewoptthin ] ) is no longer valid , and the computation of the equivalent width must be carried out using equation ( [ ew ] ) with the exact shape of the profile function . a comparison between the curves in fig . 1 and those in fig .",
    "2 allows to evaluate the effects of the line profile upon the resulting equivalent width . when the doppler broadening is dominated by the thermal motion of the ions ( @xmath73 km s@xmath6 , fig .",
    "1 ) , the dynamical range of variation of the equivalent width of each line with increasing n@xmath31 is much smaller than in the case in which the doppler broadening is dominated by a high dispersion velocity of the gas along the line of sight ( @xmath74 km s@xmath6 ) . this is because when the line is strongly broadened the core of the line needs larger column of gas to become optically thick , and so the linear branch of the growth curves spans over a larger range of n@xmath31 before saturating . from equations ( [ taunu ] ) , ( [ voigtpro ] ) and ( [ dopplerwidth ] ) , using the same numerical factor as in equation ( [ ewoptthin ] ) , and setting @xmath75",
    ", we get : @xmath76^{-0.5 } e_0^{-1}.\\ ] ] in the above equation the two terms within the square brackets describe the contribution to the core optical depth by the two considered doppler mechanisms . from equation ( [ thermturb ] ) we know that dispersion velocities of the gas along the line of sight greater than @xmath26 km s@xmath6 make the turbulence broadening mechanism very efficient compared to the thermal one , and so reduce the core optical depth of each line . equation ( [ tau0 ] ) allows then to define and evaluate the core optical depth in the two extreme cases : @xmath77 ( thermal motion only : @xmath78 ) and @xmath79 .",
    "we get : @xmath80 @xmath81 the ratio between these two quantities does not depend on the particular considered transition , the distribution of the ionic abundances in the gas , and its column density , and is therefore a good estimator of the relative contribution of the two doppler broadening mechanisms to the core optical depth : @xmath82 equation ( [ tau0thermtau0turb ] ) tells us that a given column of non - turbulent highly ionized gas in photoionization equilibrium can be more than a factor 10 thicker to the resonant absorption process ( at the energy of the transition ) than an identical column of gas undergoing strong turbulence ( @xmath83 km s@xmath6 , i.e. @xmath84 ) .",
    "the relative importance of the spectral features in spectra emerging from photoionized gas obscuring the line of sight strongly depends on the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing continuum in the uv to x - ray energy range .",

    "if a peculiar class of agn does exists , with intrinsic uv to x - ray continuum switching between these two extreme observed cases ( as suggested by the behaviour observed in 1h  0419 - 577 , ngc  4051 , re  j2248 - 511 : guainazzi et al .",

    "ngc  985 is a seyfert 1 galaxy known to host an ionized absorber ( brandt et al 1994 ) .",
    "nicastro et al .",
    "( 1998b ) observed the source with asca and confirmed the presence of an ionized absorber along the line of sight .",
    "they find that a single - zone photoionization model ( accounting for photoelectric absorption only , model _ a _ ) is not able to explain completely the complex absorption structure seen in the asca spectrum ( the continumm has been parameterized as a power law with @xmath111 up to 2.3 kev , while above this energy the spectrum flattens by @xmath112 , the ionized absorber parameters are logu=@xmath113 , logn@xmath114 , and z@xmath115 , which implies a maximum outflowing velocity @xmath116 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "analysis of the asca sis residuals shows a significant deficit of counts around @xmath117 kev ( figure 5a ) .",
    "the equivalent width of this feature ( estimated by adding a gaussian absorption line to the continuum model ) is of -(@xmath118 ) ev .",
    "we computed the spectrum emerging from gas photoionized by the ngc  985 optical to x - ray continuum using our photoelectric+resonant absorption model .",
    "we extrapolated the soft x - ray power law , as measured from the asca data , through optical wavelengths .",
    "this is consistent with both the measured o - uv spectral index @xmath119 ( de vaucouleurs et al . , 1991 ) and @xmath120=1.4 .",
    "we adopted for logu and log@xmath15 the best fit values given above and an outflowing velocity of 1000 km s@xmath6 , which is the mean measured value for the known o - uv / x - ray ionized absorbers ( mathur et al .",
    ", 1994 , 1995 , 1997 , 1998 ) , and is consistent with the estimate of the warm absorber redshift in this source .",
    "we used a dispersion velocity of 1000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the model is plotted in figure 5c .",
    "it shows strong resonance absorption lines between 0.85 and 1.2 kev due to the redshifted k@xmath63 and k@xmath3 neix and k@xmath63 nex lines .",
    "the blend of these three lines has a total equivalent with of about 20 ev , similar to the equivalent width of the line feature in figure 5a .",
    "we folded this model with the asca  sis response , and simulated a 40 ksec observation of ngc  985 .",
    "we fitted the resulting spectrum with model _ a _ ) .",
    "the ratio between the simulation and best fit model _ a _ ) is shown in figure 5b : it resembles strikingly the residuals to the ` real ' spectrum in figure 5a . while this is certainly not a self consistent , quantitative and unique description of the spectrum of ngc  985 , it indicates that resonant absoprtion may well be cause of the feature observed at about 1 kev .",
    "the spectrum in figure 5c also shows strong absorption k@xmath63 and k@xmath3 lines from ovii and oviii at 0.57 and 0.65 kev .",
    "there is no evidence for an absorption feature ( in addition to photoelectric absorption ) at these energies in the asca spectrum of ngc  985 ( fig .",
    "5a ) . contribution from emission lines due to recombination could be important at these energy , and so they could help in reducing the depth of the absorption lines .",
    "line emission strongly depends on the covering factor and therefore an accurate estimate of line emission intensity can provide information on the geometry and distribution of the ionized gas . however , the above energy is close to the lower threshold of the sis instrument , where the calibration is most uncertain and problems due to the residual dark distribution ( rdd ) are large , and where the ccd energy resolution is of 5 - 6 only . for a quantitative study of the ovii and oviii emission / absorption lines",
    "we should await instruments with better energy resolution and coverage .    as a next step we folded the photoelectric+resonant absorption model of figure 5c with the responses of axaf acis / hetg and the baseline constellation - x calorimeter , which has a factor of 2 worse energy resolution but a factor of 100 higher effective area ( at 1 kev ) .",
    "the simulations are shown in figures 6a , b , c and 7a , b , c for three different values of the dispersion velocity : @xmath121 , 500 and 1000 km s@xmath6 for panels a , b and c respectively .",
    "the first order axaf acis / meg ( `` medium energy grating '' ) simulations ( figure 6 ) were performed using the marx simulator ( wise et al . , 1997 , `` marx user guide '' , vs 1.0 ) ) .",
    "the exposure time is of 80 ksec . to simulate the calorimeter spectrum ( figure 7 ) , we wrote a simple program to fold our models with the response matrix and add statistical noise .",
    "the exposure time in the constellation - x calorimeter simulations is of 10 ksec .",
    "resonance absorption lines of width @xmath122 km s@xmath6 are detected in the axaf acis / hetg first order spectrum .",
    "all the strongest lines in figure 5c are resolved in the spectra of figure 6b , c .",
    "axaf hetg spectra of seyfert 1 galaxies will then establish whether resonant absorption is important in the ionizing gas and then provide estimates of the gas dispersion velocity and bulk motion .",
    "this will allow to solve unambiguously the open and controversial issue on the identification between the x - ray and the uv ionized absorbers .",
    "however , the signal to noise will be poor in most cases : the oviik@xmath63/k@xmath3 and neix k@xmath63/k@xmath3 line ratios , which can be used for plasma diagnostic , can not be estimated with uncertainty @xmath123 ; line widths and profiles , which gives information on the geometrical and dynamical configuration of the absorber can be roughly measured but not studied in detail .",
    "the hetg can obtain spectra of comparable quality for about one hundred agn .",
    "the large effective area of the constellation - x calorimeter along with a good energy resolution will permit to obtain high signal to noise spectra , of quality similar to optical spectra of agns , of sources of the brightness of ngc  985 .",
    "this will allow to apply plasma diagnostics , measure accurately both the chemical composition and ionic distribution of the gas , discriminate between collisional ionization and photoionization , and study the time - evolving behaviour of the relevant physical quantities ( temperature , relative ionic abundances , etc . ) which will allow in turn to constrain important physical and geometrical parameters ( electron density , and radial distance : nicastro et al .",
    ". the constellation - x calorimeter could provide moderate signal to noise spectra , similar to those in figure 6 , of sources down to a flux limit of a few @xmath124 erg @xmath92 s@xmath6 , which increases the sample of possible targets to a few tens of thousands sources .",
    "agns with luminosity in the range @xmath125 erg s@xmath6 can be studied up to z=0.3 - 0.5 , while more luminous ( @xmath126 erg s@xmath6 ) quasars will be available up to z@xmath127 ( the limit is given by the bandwidth of the constellation calorimeter more than by its sensitivity , since features at 0.5 - 1 kev are redshifted to 0.12 - 0.25 kev for z=3 ) .",
    "this will permit to study the evolution of physical state , chemical composition , and geometry of the absorbing gas with redshift and luminosity .",
    "statistical studies on the distribution of the absorber density , ionization state , chemical composition and distance from the ionizing source will be possible , which can give information on the absorber origin .",
    "we choose to test our model on the nlsy1 galaxy iras  13224 - 3809 , which showed in an asca observation a deep absorption feature in the interval 1 - 2 kev , interpreted by leighly et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in terms of resonant absorption from gas outflowing with v / c@xmath128    * figure 8a shows the ratio between the coadded asca sis0 and sis1 data and the best fitting model composed by a black body plus a power law , with best fit parameters given by kt=0.134 kev , @xmath129 and @xmath130 ( fully consistent with both the leighly et al , 1997 , and the hayashida et al . ,",
    "1997 , estimates ) .",
    "* a deep and broad deficit of counts is evident between 0.9 and 2 kev ( also see figure 1 in leighly et al .",
    "the absorption feature equivalent width ( estimated by adding a gaussian absorption line to the continuum model ) is large : ew=-(180@xmath131 ) ev . * we note that , even if the deficit of counts occurs approximately where the black body and the power law components match each other , we were not able to model the absorption  like feature without invoking a third component . *    we computed the spectrum emerging from gas photoionized by the iras  13224 - 3809 uv to x - ray continuum for a number of values of logu ( from -0.5 to 1.5 ) , logn@xmath31 ( from @xmath132 to @xmath133 @xmath92 ) and @xmath30 ( from 100 to 1000 km s@xmath6 ) .",
    "we extrapolated down to 13.6 ev and up to to * 100 kev * the best fit continuum to the asca data of iras  13224 - 3809 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the optical uv to x - ray measures of this source which suggest that the thermal disk component in this object could be present at higher energies than usually found in soft x - ray flat , broad line type 1 agn ( mas - hesse et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "* we adopted , for the hard x - ray power law , the best fit spectral index @xmath134 .",
    "this value is in excellent agreement with the mean estimate of hayashida et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . however , as brandt , mathur & elvis ( 1997 ) pointed out , the spectral index of the hard power law of iras  13224 - 3809 is highly variable , ranging between 0.7 and 1.3 .",
    "the value that we used in our model represents therefore only a mean value .",
    "we stress however that the exact shape of the hard power law does not affect strongly the distribution of the relative ionic abundances in the gas for elements lighter than neon , which is instead mainly driven by the presence of a strong soft excess below @xmath135 kev .",
    "our results are therefore rather insensitive to the exact slope of the hard power law . * as in the previous case we adopted an outflowing velocity of 1000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we folded these models with the asca - sis response and then fitted them with a black body plus power law model .",
    "as an example figure 8b shows the ratio between an 80 ksec simulation obtained using log@xmath15=23.5 , logu=1 and outflowing and dispersion velocities of 1000 km s@xmath6 ( model shown in figure 8c ) , and the best fitting black body plus power law model .",
    "* we note that all the relevant absorption lines lie in a spectral region in which the intrinsic continuum is still dominated by the soft black body component ( fig 8c , but see also fig .",
    "* the residuals resemble those in figure 8a .",
    "the large deficit of counts between 0.9 and 2 kev is due to the presence of a large number of iron l lines .",
    "the coadded equivalent width of these lines is about 130 ev , similar to the equivalent width of the absorption feature in figure 8a .",
    "as for the case of ngc  985 , we plot in figure 9a , b , c and 10a , b , c three simulations obtained convolving the spectrum in figure 8c with the axaf / meg and constellation - x calorimeter responses .",
    "the simulations are shown for three values of the dispersion velocity , @xmath121 , 500 and 1000 km s@xmath6 ( figure a , b and c respectively ) .",
    "integration time was 100 ksec for the first order axaf / meg spectrum and 20 ksec for the constellation - x calorimeter spectrum .",
    "many single fe l lines are well resolved even in spectra with dispersion velocity of 1000 km s@xmath6 .",
    "axaf / hetg spectra of low redshift nlsy1 with luminosity l@xmath136 erg s@xmath6 will permit to unambiguously establish whether an ionized absorber is indeed responsible for the 1 kev deficit of counts seen in many moderate resolution x - ray spectra of these sources .",
    "the low signal to noise ratio of axaf / hetg spectra , however , will not allow to apply plasma diagnostics to infer the physical properties of the absorbers .",
    "nevertheless the outflowing and dispersion velocities of the gas will be accurately derived , as well as the relative ne to o , and fe to si and mg abundances , which will put important constraints on the geometry and the chemical composition in the agn environment .",
    "the high effective area of the constellation - x calorimeter will allow to greatly increase the sample of narrow - line type 1 agn observed at high resolution .",
    "the complex iron l edges and lines absorption system could be detected in high luminosity narrow line quasars up to redshift @xmath137 , or even higher , depending on the actual response below the carbon edge ( 0.283 kev ) , while mg and si k@xmath63 and k@xmath3 resonance absorption lines could be detected up to z@xmath138 .",
    "the good energy resolution ( 3 ev ) , will permit to separate the strongest ( oscillator strength greater than 0.05 ) single resonance absorption lines of the 1 kev iron l edge+line complex , so allowing for a clear diagnostic of the mechanism responsible for the ionization of the gas .",
    "in particular , an accurate measure of the relative abundances of the very stable fexvii li - like ion could allow to clearly distinguish between gas in collisional or photoionization equilibrium ( nicastro et al .",
    "time evolving ionization can also be investigated , so giving constraints on the electron density and the radial distance of the absorbers ( nicastro et al .",
    "we have calculated spectra emerging from ionized gas taking into account both photoelectric and resonant absorption .",
    "we find that the emerging spectra are strongly modified by resonant absorption if the dispersion velocity in the gas is @xmath139 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this or even higher values are not irrealistic , since many broad line agn show absorption lines in the uv blueshifted by 200 - 2000 km s@xmath6 , and broadened by similar dispersion velocities .      1 .",
    "the distribution of relative ionic abundances in photoionized gas dramatically depends on the exact shape of the ionizing continuum .",
    "strong k@xmath63 and k@xmath3 resonance absorption lines from he - like and h - like ions of c , o , and ne , along with deep cvi , ovii - oviii , neix - x k edges , and fexv - xvii l edges , are expected to be present in the 0.1 - 3 kev spectra of flat x - ray spectrum quasars emerging from photoionized gas along the line of sight .",
    "when fitting low and medium resolution x - ray data with phenomenological multi - edge models , these resonance absorption lines may produce the effect of overestimating the optical depth of the oviii k edge .",
    "conversely , no strong absorption edge is expected to be imprinted on spectra emerging from gas illuminated by steep ionizing continua , with physical and geometrical properties similar to those found in broad line type 1 agn . however , a large number of strong fe l and mg , si , and s k@xmath63 and k@xmath3 resonance absorption lines ( almost 70 ) are predicted between 1 and 2 kev .",
    "fitting low and medium energy resolution data with continuum models may then result in deep smooth negative residuals at these energies .",
    "we then suggest that the @xmath0 kev absorption feature observed by asca in several narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies can be explained in terms of resonance absorption lines , without requiring relativistic outflowing velocities of the gas .",
    "the equivalent width of the predicted resonant absorption lines strongly depends on the column density of the absorbing gas and the its dispersion velocity . assuming the range of n@xmath31 typically observed and dispersion velocities of 01000 km s@xmath6",
