    "theories of modified gravity become very popular in the beginning of our century in attempts to explain the accelerated expansion of our universe which is proved observationally @xcite .",
    "another motivation is incorporating quantum corrections to general relativity ( gr ) which are believed to be present in the form of terms of higher order in the curvature .",
    "it is known that introducing additional terms , proportional to the kretchmann invariant @xmath7 into the action often leads to solution with increasing spatial anisotropy @xcite incompatible with the known picture of our universe .",
    "this is the reason why modified gravity theories often deal with only @xmath0-corrections to hilbert - einstein action .",
    "however , special properties of the gauss - bonnet combination @xmath8 make @xmath9 correction terms reasonable to study . since @xmath2 is a topological invariant in 4 dimensions , terms linear in @xmath2 do not modify the equations of motion ( if @xmath2 enters into the action in a product with function of another dynamical variable , like in string - gravity corrections , it modifies equations of motion and gives rise to interesting effects @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological effects of @xmath0 correction terms have been studied recently for a number of different functions @xmath3 .    in the present paper",
    "we consider both @xmath0 and @xmath10 corrections to the einstein gravity , find a situation where they are equally important and outline differences of cosmological behaviour in such combined model from models with only @xmath0 or @xmath10 terms in the action .",
    "viable cosmological models have been constructed for each theory separately ( see , e.g. , @xcite for @xmath10 ) .",
    "furthermore , finite - time singularities ( @xcite ) , cosmological perturbations ( @xcite ) , stability around a spherically symmetric static space - time ( @xcite ) , and the number of degrees of freedom and ghost problems ( @xcite ) have already been investigated .",
    "recently more general theories with @xmath11 have become a subject of investigation @xcite .",
    "the review @xcite considers some more complicated versions of modified gravity including non - local theories and solutions which can be of interest from the viewpoint of cosmic acceleration have been described .",
    "our goal is different : we try to consider the general picture of cosmological dynamics in modified gravity theories applying the dinamical system approach , used actively in @xmath0 gravity @xcite .",
    "we make the next step taking into account the gauss - bonnet term restricting ourself in the present paper to a particular case where the function @xmath12 is a sum of a function of @xmath13 and a function of @xmath2 .",
