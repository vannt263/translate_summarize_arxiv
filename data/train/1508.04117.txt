    "this paper concerns the time evolution of a system of @xmath0 interacting identical spinless bose particles of mass  @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is assumed to be large . at each moment",

    "its dynamics are governed by an @xmath0-particle schrdinger equation @xmath9      \\psi(\\bm r_1 , \\ldots , \\bm r_n ; t ) \\ ; ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes a single - particle hamiltonian containing an external potential  @xmath11 which may depend explicitly on time , so as to exert some controlling influence on the system , and the interparticle interaction  @xmath12 naturally is symmetric , @xmath13 we will assume that @xmath12 can be replaced by an effective contact interaction with strength  @xmath14 , @xmath15 which means that we restrict ourselves to the low - energy regime  @xcite .",
    "the central question addressed in this work is under what conditions an approximate description of the dynamics in terms of a mean - field amplitude @xmath16 evolving according to the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite is viable , and , if so , how that amplitude is related to the actual wave function  @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath17 depends on only one spatial coordinate @xmath18 , it contains much less information than the many - body wave function  ( [ eq : mbw ] ) could possibly carry .",
    "therefore , a reduction of the full @xmath0-particle dynamics to the mean - field level without essential loss of information is feasible only if already the @xmath0-particle wave function itself is relatively _ simple _ , or _ ordered _",
    ", so that the mean - field amplitude , if it exists , may be regarded as an order parameter of the system  @xcite . according to common knowledge deriving from london s theory of superfluids  @xcite",
    "the mean - field amplitude should correspond to a `` macroscopic wave function '' , that is , to a macroscopically occupied single - particle orbital .",
    "this is fully in line with the preservation of information : in the ideal case where all @xmath0  particles occupy the same orbital , no information is lost if @xmath19 equals that orbital . but",
    "this leads to further questions when the system is subjected to time - dependent forcing : even if the initial state is given exactly by an @xmath0-fold occupied single - particle orbital , this initial order might be destroyed by the external force , and the time - dependent many - particle state may become arbitrarily complicated , no longer admitting a mean - field description . on the other hand , one may formally solve the gross - pitaevskii equation with an arbitrary type of external forcing incorporated into the single - particle hamiltonian  @xmath20 .",
    "hence , there must be some sort of indicator which tells one whether or not the solution to the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation can actually serve as a macroscopic wave function of the forced @xmath0-particle system . here",
    "we explore this intuitive idea in mathematical terms .    as a guideline for the following deliberations , and to state the subject as clearly as possible , we briefly sketch a popular pseudo - derivation of the gross - pitaevskii equation . to this end",

    "if it is taken literally , each @xmath0-particle state @xmath33 , no matter how `` simple '' , can only produce a left - hand side equal to zero , since the @xmath1-particle state @xmath34 is orthogonal to @xmath33 in fock space .",
    "hence , when working with eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbs ] ) one supposes that the superselection rule for the total particle number  @xmath0 is somehow violated , and the state @xmath35 with respect to which the expectation values  ( [ eq : sbs ] ) are taken is some coherent superposition of @xmath0-particle states @xmath36 with different  @xmath0 , @xmath37 this corresponds to the idea that the @xmath2 symmetry associated with particle number conservation is spontaneously broken .",
    "while that concept may be helpful for simplifying formal calculations , it remains an auxiliary device not rooted on the grounds of the actually given @xmath0-particle system .",
    "this deficiency has led to several profound discussions in the literature , and to the development of number - conserving approaches  @xcite .",
    "the unreflected use of the notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking has been severely challenged by leggett , who criticizes that _ there are no circumstances in which eq .",
    "( [ eq : sup ] ) is the physically correct description of the system _ , and maintains that the definition  ( [ eq : sbs ] ) is `` liable to generate pseudoproblems , and is best avoided ''  @xcite .",
    "thus , one of the goals of the present study is to provide an alternative , logically more transparent definition of the mean - field amplitude for an @xmath0-boson system .",
    "in contrast to customary analysis , our approach does not involve a splitting of the field operator into a condensate part and a remainder .",
    "instead , we will first introduce a candidate mean - field amplitude by taking matrix elements of the field operator with the physical @xmath0-particle state and certain auxiliary @xmath1-particle states , and then provide a criterion which decides whether or not that candidate is physically meaningful , so that it qualifies as a macroscopic wave function .    still staying within the framework of spontaneously broken symmetry , an appealing possibility to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : sbs ] ) seems to arise when @xmath35 is a _ coherent state _ , which , by definition , is an eigenstate of the annihilation operator : @xmath38 or , upon return to the schrdinger picture , @xmath39 in this respect such many - body coherent states are analogs of the familiar standard harmonic - oscillator coherent states already introduced in the early days of quantum mechanics  @xcite . intuitively speaking , eq .",
    "( [ eq : csi ] ) means that @xmath35 is `` simple '' in the sense that it remains unchanged if one particle is removed .",
    "however , if @xmath35 is an eigenstate of @xmath40 at one particular moment  @xmath26 , it will not , in general , be one at others .",
    "therefore , we are confronted with the necessity to admit more general concepts of `` coherence '' .    following the traditional route for the time being and taking the symmetry - broken expectation value  ( [ eq : sbs ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hom ] ) immediately yields @xmath41 this leads to another pertinent problem : of course one could write down the equation of motion for the third moment appearing here , but this would involve still higher moments , and so on , leading to an infinite chain of equations expressing an infinite momentum hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "the gross - pitaevskii equation results from the assumption that this chain can be terminated at the lowest possible level , so that the expectation value of the triple operator product is replaced by the product of the expectation values of the individual operators : @xmath42 here the `` @xmath43''-sign is meant to indicate that this closure hypothesis  ( [ eq : top ] ) generally constitutes an uncontrolled approximation ; note , however , that it would be exact for a coherent state  ( [ eq : csi ] ) . accepting this factorization , eq .",
    "( [ eq : trp ] ) finally turns into the celebrated gross - pitaevskii equation  @xcite , namely , @xmath44 since one has the identity @xmath45 for any @xmath3 , one deduces from the definition  ( [ eq : sbs ] ) that the mean - field amplitude is normalized to unity , @xmath46 now assuming factorization of the expectation value  ( [ eq : evn ] ) .    besides providing an alternative definition of the mean - field amplitude not based on spontaneous breach of symmetry , questioning and monitoring the accuracy of the required closure hypothesis constitutes a main objective of this work .",
    "we proceed as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we outline a tentative construction process of a candidate mean - field amplitude associated with an @xmath0-particle state @xmath47 .",
    "this construction rests on the introduction of subsidiary @xmath1-particle states @xmath48 which are obtained from @xmath47 by the annihilation of one particle ; the dynamics of these states are governed by the same hamiltonian as those of the physical state @xmath47 .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to the introduction of a condensate wave function by lifshitz and pitaevskii in ref .",
    "@xcite , but places particular emphasis on the way the initially `` neighboring '' states @xmath47 and @xmath48 evolve in time : do they , in a suitable sense , remain close to each other ?",
    "the subsequent derivation of the candidate s equation of motion then makes clear under what conditions the gross - pitaevskii equation  ( [ eq : gpe ] ) is satisfied , so that the construction yields a _ bona fide _ macroscopic wave function .",
    "if , on the other hand , these conditions are not met , the candidate bears no physical meaning and has to be discarded .",
    "these considerations are not meant as a substitute for rigorous mathematical analysis  @xcite , but rather as an elaboration of the salient features which make the gross - pitaevskii equation work .",
    "in particular , we isolate a notion of coherence which does not correspond , in the first place , to a single - particle orbital being macroscopically occupied , but which places a certain demand on the flow in fock space instead , requiring its stiffness .",
    "the general scheme is applied in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] to a numerically tractable model system , describing a driven josephson junction .",
    "the model is presented in sec .",
    "[ sub:31 ] , and the corresponding equations of motion are derived in sec .",
    "[ sub:32 ] , now paying particular attention to keeping all error terms .",
    "the results of selected numerical calculations which support our reasoning in considerable detail are discussed at length in sec .",
    "[ sub:33 ] . besides being paradigmatically simple",
    ", the model has the further pleasant feature that it lends itself to a semiclassical interpretation , allowing one to relate the @xmath0-particle dynamics to those of a driven nonlinear pendulum . as laid out in sec .",
    "[ sub:34 ] , this semiclassical view leads to important qualitative insights which may guide the analysis of more complicated , experimentally accessible systems in the future .",
    "thus , the model calculations collected in this sec .  [ sec:3 ] complement recent studies of periodically @xmath49-kicked bose - einstein condensates which aim at exploring nonlinear dynamics in a quantum many - body context  @xcite ; here we emphasize the potential usefulness of a sinusoidal force with a slowly varying envelope .",
    "we finally phrase our main findings , and draw some general conclusions , in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "we start by constructing the @xmath0-particle fock - space state vector @xmath47 corresponding to some given wave function @xmath5 : building on a vacuum state @xmath50 characterized by @xmath51 and @xmath52 we have @xmath53 repeatedly using the identity @xmath54 which follows directly from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bcr ] ) and ( [ eq : vac ] ) , one confirms that this state is properly normalized , @xmath55 provided the schrdinger wave function is , @xmath56 this state vector  ( [ eq : stv ] ) evolves in time according to the schrdinger equation @xmath57 with the many - body hamiltonian  ( [ eq : mbh ] ) .",
    "the system s one - particle reduced density matrix , as given by @xmath58 then takes the explicit form @xmath59 it might appear natural to introduce a time - dependent macroscopic wave function on the basis of the penrose - onsager criterion for bose - einstein condensation in an interacting @xmath0-particle system  @xcite : at each moment  @xmath26 one can , in principle , perform a spectral decomposition @xmath60 of this density matrix  ( [ eq : opr ] ) into a complete orthonormal set of single - particle eigenfunctions @xmath61 . if then only one of the eigenvalues , say @xmath62 , is on the order of @xmath0 , while all other ones are at most of order @xmath63 , one has a simple bose - einstein condensate at @xmath26 , and the eigenfunction @xmath64 can be regarded as the instantaneous macroscopic wave function . however , according to this construction the phase of @xmath64 remains undetermined , and unrelated to the phase of @xmath65 at another moment  @xmath66 , whereas the gross - pitaevskii equation  ( [ eq : gpe ] ) for @xmath19 constitutes an initial - value problem which does not leave such a freedom .",
    "hence , even in the most ideal case in which @xmath67 for all @xmath26 , it is not possible to reconstruct the full time - dependent macroscopic wave function from the one - particle reduced density matrix , even if one knows the exact many - body state at all times , because the phase of the macroscopic wave function evidently requires additional consideration .",
    "therefore , here we take a different route . in situations where a mean - field amplitude @xmath16 can be meaningfully defined , the most obvious requirement to be placed on such an object is that its absolute square , multiplied by @xmath0 , be equal to the diagonal elements of the density matrix , that is , to the expectation values of the density operator , at least to a good approximation :",
    "@xmath68 given an initial state @xmath69 at some arbitrary initial moment  @xmath26 , it is easy to satisfy this requirement on a formal level at that moment  @xmath26 by invoking the normalized @xmath1-particle states @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a phase that can be suitably adjusted later on , and we have @xmath72 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdm ] ) , as corresponding to the particle density at the position  @xmath18 .",
    "thus , it may happen that the denominator appearing in the definition  ( [ eq : aui ] ) vanishes at certain points @xmath18 ; such points either are exempted from the analysis , or require special treatment .",
    "it is quite essential not to be misled here : @xmath73 must not be regarded as some sort of wave function depending on @xmath18 ; rather , for each @xmath18 it is a state vector in the @xmath1-particle sector of the fock space .",
    "we will mark such subsidiary @xmath1-particle states by the `` tilde''-symbol in the following .    introducing the projection operator @xmath74 one obviously has @xmath75 by the very definition  ( [ eq : aui ] ) ; as a consequence , we now may set @xmath76 evidently the projector  ( [ eq : pri ] ) does not depend on the phase @xmath71 of the subsidiary states , but this phase allows one to tune the phase of @xmath77 .",
    "this tentative construction  ( [ eq : itd ] ) still does not mean that the expression  @xmath77 actually is a macroscopic wave function at the moment  @xmath26 : the above prescription could be applied to _ any _ initial state @xmath78 , regardless of whether or not this state admits a mean - field description . at this point ,",
    "a suitable counterpart of the penrose - onsager eigenvalue criterion which distinguishes a condensate is still lacking .    the usefulness of this construction becomes evident only when it is extended to later times : besides the evolving physical @xmath0-particle state @xmath79 we also have a family , parametrized by @xmath18 , of auxiliary @xmath1-particle states which are obtained by subjecting the subsidiary initial states  ( [ eq : aui ] ) to the evolution generated by the very same hamiltonian , giving @xmath80 we now _ define _ a candidate mean - field amplitude @xmath16 for all @xmath81 by taking , in literal extension of the initial - time definition  ( [ eq : itd ] ) , the matrix elements of the field operator with these evolving states  ( [ eq : aes ] ) and ( [ eq : auf ] ) : @xmath82 note that , in contrast to the `` symmetry - breaking '' definition  ( [ eq : sbs ] ) , this still tentative definition is free of arbitrariness . the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : def ] ) can in principle be evaluated once the initial state @xmath78 is given ; there is no freedom comparable to the choice of the coefficients @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sup ] ) .",
    "however , it is not yet clear at this stage whether the quantity @xmath16 defined in this manner actually conforms to the central requirement  ( [ eq : req ] ) for @xmath84 , and whether or not it satisfies the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "obviously , the answers to these questions depend to a large extent on @xmath78 , but also on the particular time - dependence imposed on the hamiltonian . on the other hand , it is easy to see that our construction does fulfill its purpose in the ideal case where all @xmath0 particles initially occupy the same orbital  @xmath85 : then the initial many - body wave function is given by a hartree product state , @xmath86 in this case one expects @xmath87 to be equal to @xmath88 .    indeed , following the general prescription  ( [ eq : stv ] ) the state @xmath89 associated in fock space with this product wave function  ( [ eq : pwf ] ) acquires the form @xmath90^n { | { \\rm vac } \\rangle}\\label{eq : gcs}\\ ] ] and thus obeys the quasi - eigenvalue equation @xmath91 implying that the one - particle reduced density matrix  ( [ eq : opr ] ) here becomes @xmath92 this reflects precisely the penrose - onsager criterion for bose - einstein condensation  @xcite : in the case of a pure condensate the one - particle reduced density matrix  ( [ eq : sdd ] ) equals the @xmath0-fold of the projection operator onto the @xmath0-fold occupied single - particle orbital .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( [ eq : qee ] ) immediately yields @xmath93 hence , if one chooses the phase @xmath71 as the negative phase of the single - particle orbital @xmath94 , so that , for instance , @xmath95 when @xmath94 is real and positive , eq .  ( [ eq : aui ] ) here reduces to @xmath96 in conjunction with the quasi - eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : qee ] ) and our definition  ( [ eq : def ] ) of the mean - field amplitude , this furnishes the expected initial identity @xmath97 what may be even more important , eq .  ( [ eq : cos ] ) also drastically simplifies the entire construction process for _ all _ subsequent times @xmath84 , because the family  ( [ eq : auf ] ) reduces to a single member not depending on @xmath18 , and for all times the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def ] ) is inflicted solely by the field operator @xmath21 .",
    "the hartree product wave function  ( [ eq : pwf ] ) embodies the idea of `` simplicity '' in a particularly straightforward manner .",
    "if the many - body wave function carries merely the information content of a single - particle orbital , no information is lost when employing that orbital as a mean - field amplitude , in the spirit of a macroscopic wave function .",
    "for the sake of easy nomenclature we will refer to the associated fock - space states  ( [ eq : gcs ] ) as @xmath0-particle coherent  in short : @xmath0-_coherent _  in the following .",
    "this wording appears to be somewhat at odds with the quasi - eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : qee ] ) , which is reminiscent of the action of an annihilation operator on an harmonic - oscillator eigenstate , or on a typical fock state , in marked distinction to the proper eigenvalue equation  ( [ eq : tee ] ) characterizing a conventional coherent state .",
    "but it is this type of coherence which is implied by macroscopic occupation with a sharp number of particles .",
    "needless to say , an initially @xmath0-coherent state generally will not remain @xmath0-coherent in the course of time .",
    "thus , the question what property an @xmath0-particle state must have in order to admit a gross - pitaevskii description of its time evolution still needs to be settled .",
    "returning to the general case not necessarily starting from an @xmath0-coherent state  ( [ eq : gcs ] ) , the equation of motion of our candidate mean - field amplitude  ( [ eq : def ] ) is given by @xmath98 |      \\psi(t ) \\rangle_n \\ ; .",

    "this raises the question how the actual , linear @xmath0-particle system behaves when its nonlinear mean - field descendant becomes chaotic .",
    "a useful link between the @xmath0-particle level and its mean - field description in terms of the hamiltonian system  ( [ eq : hsy ] ) is provided by the @xmath175-coherent states  ( [ eq : acs ] ) : taking the expectation value of the @xmath0-particle hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hdj ] ) with respect to these states , one obtains @xmath304 which equals the classical hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hcl ] ) up to an irrelevant constant if one neglects terms of order @xmath305 , and sets @xmath306 since @xmath307 , this is in perfect correspondence with the representation  ( [ eq : nsp ] ) of the @xmath0-fold occupied single - particle state which underlies the @xmath0-coherent state @xmath308 on the one hand , and with the definition  ( [ eq : dfz ] ) on the other .",
    "therefore , the squared projections @xmath309 referred to as husimi distributions , quantify the degree of affinity of the @xmath0-particle state @xmath197 with the phase - space point @xmath310 at the moment  @xmath3  @xcite .",

    "[ sub:33 ] : we take the solution @xmath197 to the @xmath0-particle schrdinger equation at certain moments  @xmath3 , compute the associated husimi distributions  ( [ eq : hud ] ) , and superimpose these distributions onto the corresponding classical phase - space portraits , that is , onto the poincar surfaces of section of the accompanying pendulum which is periodically driven with amplitude @xmath311 `` frozen '' at the value reached at the moment  @xmath3 under study .",
    "these surfaces of section are computed by solving the classical equations of motion for a representative set of initial conditions with fixed driving amplitude  @xmath311 , and by plotting the resulting phase - space points stroboscopically after each driving period  @xmath312 .",

    "the initial quantum state considered here , which is the ground state of the undriven system  ( [ eq : lmg ] ) as depicted in fig .",
    "[ f_1 ] , is semiclassically linked by means of the wkb - construction to that invariant curve @xmath314 surrounding the central fixed point which is selected by the bohr - sommerfeld condition  @xcite @xmath315 with effective planck constant @xmath316 and with quantum number @xmath317 , so that its husimi distribution appears concentrated around that curve @xmath318 .",
    "when the driving amplitude is increased , a large fraction of the invariant curves is destroyed giving way to chaotic motion , while those surrounding the central fixed point are deformed , but remain preserved if @xmath311 does not become too large , forming a regular island embedded in a chaotic sea .",
    "if the pulse s amplitude increases on a time scale which is slow compared to the period @xmath312 , these preserved curves represent adiabatic invariants to which the time - evolving wave function remains tied in a wkb - type manner .",
    "this is what explains the scenario depicted in fig .",
    "[ f_14 ] : for low driving strength the evolving quantum state clinges to its adiabatic invariant still contained in the regular island , but with increasing amplitude the island becomes so small that the required invariant does no longer exist .",
    "then the husimi projection of the quantum state , having nothing left it can cling to , spills out more or less over the entire phase space , leading to a final quantum state which contains many eigenstates of the undriven junction  ( [ eq : lmg ] ) .    with this background knowledge",
    "the difference between the pulses recorded in fig .",
    "[ f_5 ] on the one hand , and in fig .",
    "[ f_7 ] on the other , becomes intuitively clear , recalling that for the latter pulse the maximum scaled amplitude @xmath273 has been maintained while the particle number has been increased to @xmath193 . because this implies that the effective planck constant  ( [ eq : epc ] ) is reduced by a factor of  @xmath262 , the required phase - space curve @xmath318 now encircles a correspondingly smaller area .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_15 ] , it therefore fits into the shrinking and re - growing regular island during the entire pulse , albeit just barely so at its maximum .",
    "thus , the quantum state evolving under the influence of the pulse remains semiclassically associated with an adiabatic invariant which is preserved from the pulse s beginning until its end , and thus enables adiabatic following . as a result , the final @xmath0-particle state here closely resembles the initial one .    a mere glimpse on fig .",
    "[ f_16 ] then suffices to grasp why no further enhancement of the particle number whatsoever , together with the implied reduction of the interparticle interaction in order to maintain a constant value of  @xmath195 , could possibly bring one back to the gross - pitaevskii regime under the conditions of figs .",
    "[ f_10 ] and [ f_12 ] : here the pulse possesses the maximum amplitude @xmath281 , which is so strong that the regular island which still hosts the adiabatic invariant at the early stages of the pulse is destroyed completely when the envelope approaches its maximum . hence ,",
    "no matter how large the particle number  @xmath0 and , consequently , how small the effective planck constant  ( [ eq : epc ] ) , there is no preserved adiabatic invariant which could possibly carry a macroscopic wave function . instead , fig .",
    "[ f_16 ] visualizes that upon destruction of the island the quantum state aquires a degree of complexity which strikingly contrasts the simplicity of the initial condition .",
    "obviously this sudden increase of complexity , as corresponding to a sudden loss of order , reflects the sudden drop of stiffness observed in figs .",
    "[ f_10 ] and [ f_12 ] , signaling the sudden death of the mean field .",
    "we suggest that this scenario is quite general , so that it would be experimentally accessible , for instance , with pulsed bose - einstein condensates in anharmonic trapping potentials  @xcite .",
    "one usually takes recourse to a mean - field theory , which in many cases is still tractable by numerical means , to obtain information on intricate many - particle dynamics , which in general do not lend themselves to direct simulations . in our approach to the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation this common strategy has been reversed , in order to clarify questions concerning the emergence and possible persistence of an order parameter in a system of @xmath0  bosons exposed to external forcing : assuming that we know its exact many - particle wave function @xmath319 , we have asked how this knowledge can be used for constructing the associated macroscopic wave function , provided that it exists , in the form of a mean - field amplitude @xmath19 .",
    "the answer , formalized in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : aui ] ) , ( [ eq : aes ] ) , ( [ eq : auf ] ) , and ( [ eq : def ] ) , is conceptually interesting insofar as it does neither involve the formal limit @xmath111 , nor the notion of spontaneous symmetry breaking : take the initial @xmath0-particle state , annihilate a particle , and propagate both the initial state and the subsidiary @xmath1-particle states thus obtained in time ; a candidate mean - field amplitude then is introduced by taking the matrix elements of the annihilation operator with these evolving states .",
    "the starting point of this construction resembles the specification of a condensate wave function by lifshitz and pitaevskii  @xcite , but the additional consideration of time evolution in response to external forcing brings about a new twist .",
    "namely , in order to decide whether or not the candidate actually is a proper mean - field amplitude , which is tantamount to the question whether or not a macroscopic wave function of the driven system still does exist , it is not sufficient to follow solely the trajectory of the given @xmath0-particle state in fock space .",
    "rather , one has to compare this given trajectory to other trajectories initially close to it , differing by one in particle number , and to check to what extent these initially close trajectories diverge in the course of time .",
    "this is what is effectively quantified by the projection  ( [ eq : dco ] ) : if the absolute value of this scalar product  @xmath132 equals unity to good approximation , the state obtained by first evolving the initial condition in time and annihilating a particle at a later moment differs merely by a phase factor from the states obtained by annihilating first and evolving thereafter .",
    "this property of @xmath3-coherence , indicated by @xmath320 , means that initial states differing by one in particle number move in some sense parallel to each other in fock space . in this case",
    "the flow in fock space can be considered as stiff , similar to laminar flow in fluid mechanics .",
    "this is the quality of `` simplicity '' required for ensuring the presence of a genuine mean - field amplitude : if @xmath320 at least to a good approximation , the candidate actually qualifies as a macroscopic wave function and obeys the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii - equation ; if not , it has no immediate physical significance .",
    "the model of the driven josephson junction studied in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] suggests that the occurrence of chaotic solutions to the gross - pitaevskii equation reflects the loss of @xmath3-coherence on the @xmath0-particle level .",
    "our findings thus extend previous studies  @xcite which have cast doubt on the validity of a gross - pitaevskii - type mean - field approach under chaotic conditions .",
    "it appears that the distinction between order and chaos , which has been explored in great depth in classical mechanics  @xcite , may have implications of its own in quantum many - body physics . in particular , the scenario depicted in fig .",
    "[ f_12 ] indicates in a striking manner that a macroscopic wave function can be destroyed almost instantaneously upon entering a chaotic regime .",
    "recent pioneering works which have taken up the investigation of many - body quantum chaos have considered @xmath49-kicked condensates  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , here we have studied the response to a sinusoidal force with a `` slowly '' varying envelope .",
    "one of our most important results , albeit obtained for one particular model system only , consists in the observation that adiabatic following to such slowly changing driving forces allows one to preserve a pre - existing macroscopic wave function , and to transport it almost without loss of @xmath3-coherence into the regime of strong driving , as shown exemplarily in fig .",
    "this finding almost provides a blueprint for generating floquet condensates  @xcite .",
    "more generally , it may be of interest for guiding further experiments with time - periodically forced bose - einstein condensates intended to engineer novel systems which may not be accessible without such forcing  @xcite : if it is possible to preserve maximum stiffness , or @xmath3-coherence , even in the presence of strong forcing , it should also be possible to actively manipulate macroscopic wave functions by applying suitable coherent control techniques .",
