    "<S> we present ultrahigh - resolution measurements of state - to - state inelastic differential cross sections for no - ne and no - ar collisions , obtained by combining the stark deceleration and velocity map imaging techniques . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for counterpropagating crossed beam geometries , the effect of the velocity spreads of the reagent beams on the angular resolution of the images is minimized . </S>",
    "<S> futhermore , the counterpropagating geometry results in images that are symmetric with respect to the relative velocity vector . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for the use of inverse abel transformation methods that enhance the resolution further . </S>",
    "<S> state - resolved diffraction oscillations in the differential cross sections are measured with an angular resolution approaching 0.3@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> distinct structures observed in the cross sections gauge the quality of recent _ ab initio _ potential energy surfaces for no - rare gas atom collisions with unprecedented precision .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of experimental methods to study molecular collisions with the highest possible detail has been a quest in molecular collision research since it was established in the 1950s . in recent years , velocity map imaging ( vmi ) has revolutionized our ability to study molecular collision processes in crossed beam experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the power of the technique derives from the ability to record a two - dimensional image of scattered molecules that directly reflects their recoil velocities and thus the differential cross section ( dcs ) of the scattering process . in the last decade </S>",
    "<S> , vmi has been implemented in many scattering experiments and has made experiments possible that would have been inconceivable only a few years ago @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> precise measurements of dcss provide unique and sensitive tests for the underlying potential energy surfaces ( pess ) that govern the dynamics of interacting molecules . to validate the ever more sophisticated and accurate theoretical descriptions of scattering processes , it is essential to obtain ever higher resolutions in the experimental scattering images . </S>",
    "<S> the inherent resolution of vmi in principle allows for dcs measurements that probe pess with spectroscopic resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the image resolution that is typically obtained in crossed beam experiments , however , is limited by the velocity spreads of both beams involved . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap between the signals from collision partners with different velocities can significantly blur the images , thereby obscuring detailed structures that may be present in the dcs .    in the last decade </S>",
    "<S> , several techniques have been developed to obtain complete control over molecules in beams . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , methods such as stark and zeeman deceleration allow for the production of packets of molecules with high density , tunable velocity , near - zero velocity spread and almost perfect quantum state purity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , these tamed molecular beams are ideally suited for precise molecular scattering experiments , in particular when combined with state - of - the art detection techniques such as vmi . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have reported the first crossed beam experiment in which a stark decelerator was combined with vmi , indeed resulting in scattering images with much higher resolution @xcite .    yet , </S>",
    "<S> thus far only one of the reagent beams has been velocity - controlled using a stark decelerator . </S>",
    "<S> the image resolution is then limited by the relatively large velocity spread of the collision partner  which is produced via conventional beam methods . </S>",
    "<S> although reduction of this spread using mechanical velocity filters appears feasible , it will be difficult to reach the narrow distribution that is readily achieved for the stark - decelerated reagent beam .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we present a method to minimize the contribution of the collision partner s velocity spread to the angular resolution of the scattering images . exploiting the favorable kinematics present </S>",
    "<S> when counterpropagating beams are used , we obtain record - high angular resolutions and thereby probe dcss with unprecedented accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by fully resolving diffraction oscillations in state - to - state dcss for no - ne and no - ar collisions . </S>",
    "<S> for no - ar , we observe distinct features in the diffraction pattern that appear extremely sensitive to the details of the pess . </S>",
    "<S> these features are used to gauge the quality of two recent pess for this benchmark system .    </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the crossed beam geometry on the kinematics and resolution of the experiment is illustrated in figure [ fig : kinematics ] . </S>",
    "<S> for the sake of the argument , newton diagrams are shown for the scattering of two beams containing particles of equal mass and equal pre - collision mean velocity . </S>",
    "<S> beam crossing angles of 90@xmath0 and 180@xmath1 are assumed in panels _ a _ and _ b _ , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we approximate the kinematics present in our crossed beam experiments ( a stark - decelerated beam with mean velocity @xmath2 crosses with a conventional beam with mean velocity @xmath3 ) by assuming that only the conventional beam has a non - zero velocity spread . to model a structured dcs </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a hypothetical dcs that exhibits a series of block functions , indicated by colored stripes , that are spaced with an angular interval of 12.5@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> newton diagrams are shown for scattering with the mean velocity ( blue ) , and the two outermost values from the beam distribution ( red and green ) .    </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that for scattering angles around forward scattering ( @xmath4 )  where the most detailed structures in dcss are typically found  the _ velocity _ spread of the collision partner does not contribute to the image blurring when a counterpropagating beam geometry is used . </S>",
    "<S> the angular image resolution is then exclusively determined by the _ </S>",
    "<S> angular _ spread of the beam , and high angular image resolutions can be achieved by simply collimating the beam . </S>",
    "<S> this sharply contrasts the situation for a 90@xmath1 crossing angle . here , the velocity spread of the collision partner results in both radial _ and _ angular blurring of the image ; angular image resolutions can only be significantly improved by reducing the velocity spread of the collision partner .    </S>",
    "<S> the counterpropagating geometry has the additional advantage that scattering images are inherently cylindrically symmetric with respect to the mean relative velocity vector of the colliding beams ( see figure [ fig : kinematics ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for the use of inverse abel transformation methods to retrieve the angular scattering distributions that underly the three - dimensional newton spheres . </S>",
    "<S> this transformation effectively cancels the additional blurring of images that occurs when these newton spheres are projected onto the detector plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> again , this sharply contrasts the situation for a 90@xmath1 crossing angle . here , the inherent angular and radial resolution is different in every part of the image , and symmetry with respect to the mean relative velocity is broken . </S>",
    "<S> further asymmetry in image intensity arises that is related to a detection bias for low laboratory recoil velocities which are preferentially found on one side of the image @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> together , these asymmetries have thus far prevented the use of abel inversion methods in crossed beam scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> methods to improve image resolutions by recording only a central slice of the newton sphere have been developed @xcite , but in crossed beam experiments one can not always afford the inherent reduction in signal intensity . </S>",
    "<S> either way , complex forward iterative methods are required to disentangle instrument dependent detection probabilities from the desired scattering intensity distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of counterpropagating beam geometries in crossed beam experiments is rather unconventional . </S>",
    "<S> henning meyer successfully used counterpropagating pulsed beam scattering techniques in the early 90 s to facilitate measurements of angular resolved state specific product distributions using time - of - flight detection of the scattered molecules @xcite , but the technique has hardly been used ever since .    </S>",
    "<S> we use a crossed beam scattering apparatus in which a packet of no ( @xmath5 ) radicals with a mean velocity of 350  m / s , a velocity spread of 1.2 m / s ( 1@xmath6 ) , and an angular spread of 0.04@xmath1 ( 1@xmath6 ) is produced by passing a beam of no through a 2.6  m long stark decelerator @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the packet of no collides with a beam of ne or ar atoms at a beam intersection angle of 180@xmath1 , resulting in a relatively high collision energy of 720 @xmath7 and 725 @xmath7 for no - ne and no - ar , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the rare gas atom beam is well collimated by placing a 1  mm wide slit between the 2  mm diameter skimmer and the interaction region . </S>",
    "<S> scattered molecules are detected state - selectively using a two - color laser ionization scheme and a standard vmi geometry @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two laser beams are directed parallel to the detector plane , and cross each other at right angles .    </S>",
    "<S> the implementation of a counterpropagating beam geometry in our experiment is aided by the use of reagent beam pulses with a narrow temporal distribution , such that the pulses only spatially overlap within a well defined volume . in the interaction region , </S>",
    "<S> the packet of no radicals and the rare gas atom beam has a temporal width of 25  @xmath8s and 15 @xmath8s , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment is synchronized such that the leading edges of both beams overlap for only about 5  @xmath8s before both detection lasers are fired .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : raw - data](_a _ ) and ( _ b _ ) depict the experimental scattering images for inelastic collisions of no ( @xmath9 ) with ne and ar that excite the no radicals to the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 state , respectively . a clear oscillatory structure  </S>",
    "<S> originating from the quantum mechanical nature of molecules that leads to diffraction of matter waves during molecular collisions  is observed for both scattering systems . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath12 channel for no - ne has a relatively large integral cross section of 2.7 @xmath13 , and the well - separated diffraction oscillations in this system could be observed in our previous experiments using a @xmath14 beam crossing angle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> comparison with the present results shows that when a counterpropagating geometry is used , a superior angular resolution is obtained , even though the collision energy is higher resulting in a smaller peak - to - peak separation of the diffraction peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 channel for no - ar has an integral cross section of only 0.77 @xmath13 , and despite various efforts we have been unable to resolve oscillations in the dcs for this system in previous experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the channel displays one of the richest diffraction structures that we have identified thus far , with a peak - to - peak separation between individual diffraction peaks of 1.6@xmath1 ( _ vide infra _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> the clearly resolved oscillations observed here for this system are a testimony of the unprecedented angular resolution afforded by the counterpropagating geometry .    </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the images are ( almost ) symmetric with respect to the relative velocity vector . within our experimental geometry , </S>",
    "<S> doppler and collision induced alignment effects cause a small dependence of the detection probability on the angle between the recoiling molecule and the propagation direction of the excitation laser . however </S>",
    "<S> , this asymmetry in intensity does not affect the inherent radial and angular resolution on either side of the image , and can easily be accounted for from the known geometry of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the images are symmetric after correction for the doppler effect ; no indications were found that collision induced alignment plays a significant role for the inelastic channels studied here . a detection bias for low laboratory recoil velocities results in an additional image intensity correction factor that is equal on either side of the image .    </S>",
    "<S> after correction , the symmetric images allow for the use of inverse abel transformation methods to enhance the resolution further . using the basex suite of programs @xcite , images as shown in figure [ fig : abel - data]_a _ and _ </S>",
    "<S> b _ are obtained for the two scattering systems . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillatory structure is retrieved with a much higher resolution , as is also clear from the three - dimensional representation of the data shown in panels _ c _ and _ d_. figure [ fig : curves ] shows the angular intensity distributions ( red curves ) that are inferred from the experimental image intensities within a narrow annulus around the rims of the images . </S>",
    "<S> the dcss at the mean collision energies of the experiment , that are predicted by high level _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical close - coupling ( qm cc ) calculations that use the most recent no - ne and no - ar pess presently available @xcite , are shown as well ( black dashed curves ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally obtained scattering distributions are fully consistent with the dcss predicted by theory . in particular the angles at </S>",
    "<S> which diffraction peaks are found are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions . by definition , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical dcss presented in figure [ fig : curves ] predict the angular distributions that would be measured in the ` perfect ' experiment in which no beam spreads or other factors that limit experimental resolution are present . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that in our experiments , beam spreads and other experimental factors reduce the visibility of the diffraction structure by about a factor 2 - 3 only . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the angular resolution of the experiment by convoluting the dcss predicted by the qm cc calculations with a gaussian distribution of variable width . </S>",
    "<S> best agreement with the experimental distributions is found for widths ( @xmath16 ) of 0.45@xmath1 and 0.35@xmath1 for no - ne and no - ar , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed diffraction structure is an excellent proxy for the quality of computed pess . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath17 channel of no - ar , there is one specific peak observed at @xmath18 , as indicated by the green arrow , that appears to be extremely sensitive to the exact details of the pes . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in figure [ fig : small - peak]_a _ that shows the scattering intensity around forward scattering for no - ar on an enlarged scale . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally obtained distribution is compared with the distributions that are expected from two different no - ar pess : one developed by cybulski _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ in 2012 and one by alexander from 1999 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both potentials are of high quality , but minor differences in calculation methodology and fitting procedures result in two slightly different pess , as illustrated in panel _ </S>",
    "<S> b_. it is seen that the existence of this peak in the dcs is predicted by only one of the pess , indicating that the level of precision reached in our experiments is sufficient to discriminate between the most state - of - the - art theoretical methods presently available . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , our experiments show best agreement with the oldest pes used .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that in crossed beam scattering experiments , the ability to resolve structures in dcss can be significantly enhanced using a beam crossing angle of 180@xmath1 . for scattering angles around forward scattering , the contribution of the velocity spread of the beam(s ) to the angular resolution </S>",
    "<S> is effectively eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> the beneficial kinematics afforded by the counterpropagating geometry allows for the use of inverse abel transformation methods , facilitating the measurement of dcss with high sensitivity and angular resolution . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for the observation of detailed structures in the dcss that provide unique and stringent tests to gauge the quality of pess and quantum scattering calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> our approach appears particularly beneficial in scattering experiments that employ stark - decelerated beams , but crossed beam experiments using two conventional beams may also benefit from a 180@xmath1 crossing angle . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that the arguments outlined here for a counterpropagating geometry also hold for merged beam scattering , i.e. , experiments that use a beam crossing angle of 0@xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this offers prospects for achieving optimal image resolutions in experiments that aim for low collision energies ; an interesting approach to probe dcss at collision energies where the scattering is dominated by quantum scattering resonances . </S>"
