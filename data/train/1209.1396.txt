    "the majority of the stars in the most massive galaxies ( m@xmath2210@xmath23m@xmath14 ) formed around 810billion years ago , an epoch when star formation was at its peak @xcite .",
    "galaxies at this epoch appear to be gas - rich ( @xmath24=2080% ; @xcite ) and turbulent @xcite , with high velocity dispersions given their rotational velocities ( @xmath3=30100kms@xmath15 , @xmath25/@xmath260.21 ; e.g.  @xcite ) . within the dense and highly pressurised inter - stellar medium ( ism ) of these high - redshift galaxies , it has been suggestes that star formation may be triggered by fragmentation of dynamically unstable gas ( in contrast to star - formation occurring in giant molecular clouds in the milky - way which continually condense from a stable disk and then dissipate ) .",
    "this process may lead to the to the formation of massive ( @xmath2710@xmath28m@xmath14 ) star - forming regions ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and give rise to the the clumpy morphologies that are often seen in high - redshift starbursts @xcite .    in order to explain the ubiquity of `` clumpy '' disks seen in images of high - redshift galaxies , numerical simulations have also suggested that most massive , star - forming galaxies at @xmath1=13 continually accrete gas from the inter - galactic medium along cold and clumpy streams from the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "this mode of accretion is at its most efficient at @xmath2912 , and offers a natural route for maintaining the high gas surface densities , star formation rates and clumpy morphologies of galaxies at these epochs . in such models , the gas disks fragment into a few bound clumps which are a factor 10100@xmath21 more massive than star - forming complexes in local galaxies .",
    "the gravitational release of energy as the most massive clumps form , torques between in - spiraling clumps and energy injection from star formation are all likely to contribute to maintaining the high turbulence velocity dispersion of the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",

    "in order to refine or refute these models , the observational challenge is now to quantitatively measure the internal properties of high - redshift galaxies , such as their cold molecular gas mass and surface density , disk scaling relations , chemical make up , and distribution and intensity of star formation . indeed , constraining the evolution of the star formation and gas scaling relations with redshift , stellar mass and/or gas fraction are required in order to understand star formation throughout the universe . in particular , such observations",
    "are vital to determine if the prescriptions for star formation which have been developed at @xmath1=0 can be applied to the rapidly evolving ism of gas - rich , high - redshift galaxies @xcite .    to gain a census of the dominant route by which galaxies assemble the bulk of their stellar mass within a well selected sample of high - redshift galaxies , we have conducted a wide field ( several degree - scale ) near - infrared narrow - band survey ( the high - z emission line survey ; hizels ) which targets h@xmath0 emitting galaxies in four precise ( @xmath30=0.03 ) redshift slices : @xmath1=0.40 , 0.84 , 1.47 and 2.23 @xcite .",
    "this survey provides a large , star formation limited sample of identically selected h@xmath0 emitters with properties `` typical '' of galaxies which will likely evolve into @xmath27l@xmath20 galaxies by @xmath1=0 , but seen at a time when they are assembling the bulk of their stellar mass , and thus at a critical stage in their evolutionary history .",
    "moreover , since hizels was carried out in the best - studied extra - galactic survey fields , there is a wealth of multi - wavelength data , including 1636 medium and broad - band photometry ( from rest - frame uv  mid - infrared wavelengths allowing robust stellar masses to be derived ) , _ herschel _ 250500@xmath31 m imaging ( allowing bolometric luminosities and star formation rates to be derived ) as well as high - resolution morphologies for a subset from the _ hubble space telescope _",

    "the resulting dust - corrected h@xmath0 star formation rate for the sample is sfr@xmath41=16@xmath105m@xmath14yr@xmath15 , which is consistent with that inferred from the far - infrared seds using stacked _ herschel _ spire observations(sfr@xmath56=18@xmath108m@xmath14yr@xmath15 ; @xcite )    next , to investigate the star formation occurring within the ism of each galaxy , we measure the star formation surface density and velocity dispersion of each pixel in the maps .",
    "since we do not have spatially resolved reddening maps , for each galaxy we simply correct the star formation rate in each pixel using the best - fit e(b@xmath53v ) for that system .",

    "we see that there appears to be a correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath3 , and as @xcite show , this power - law correlation may be a natural consequence of the gas and star formation surface density scaling laws .",

    "following @xcite , and focusing on the largest unstable fluctuations , the appropriate combination of gas and stellar surface density ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively ) is @xmath71 where @xmath72=@xmath73/@xmath74 is the ratio of the velocity dispersion of the stellar component to that of the gas ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) ..    next , @xcite show that the gas and star formation surface densities follow a scaling relation @xmath75 for local , star - forming galaxies , the exponent , @xmath76 and the absolute star formation efficiency , @xmath11=1.5@xmath100.4@xmath2110@xmath13 @xcite implying an efficiency for star formation per unit mass of @xmath270.04 which holds across at least four orders of magnitude in gas surface density .    combining these relations , the velocity dispersion , @xmath3 ,",

    "however , more recent studies , in particular by @xcite suggest that in super - giant hii regions , l@xmath90 may be a more appropriate scaling ( the lower exponent arises since hii regions with the largest luminosities are generally density - bound , which means that a significant fraction of the ionizing radiation escapes and so does not contribute to the luminosity , making shallower slopes physically possible ) .    to investigate the scaling relations of star - forming regions , in fig .",

    "thus , the surface density of the collapsed cloud is independent of radius and proportional to the surface density of the disk , with the normalisation set by the collapse factor and under the assumption @xmath7=1 .",
    "@xcite show that this model provides an reasonable fit to giant molecular clouds in the milky - way , and further , suggests that the surface density ( and hence surface brightness ) of clouds should increase with the surface density of the disk .    using our estimates of the stellar and gas masses and spatial extent of the galaxies in our sample , we derive disk surface densities of @xmath113=1.1@xmath100.4@xmath2110@xmath114m@xmath14kpc@xmath16 , and",

    "for example , assuming that their velocity dispersions are virial and adopting @xmath117=@xmath118/@xmath79 , using the average velocity dispersion and size of the clumps ( table  2 ) , we derive an average clump mass surface density of @xmath119=8@xmath102@xmath2110@xmath101m@xmath14kpc@xmath16 with @xmath120=5 ( appropriate for a uniform density sphere ) .",

    "<S> we present adaptive optics assisted integral field spectroscopy of nine h@xmath0-selected galaxies at @xmath1=0.842.23 drawn from the hizels narrow - band survey . </S>",

    "<S> we demonstrate that within the ism of these galaxies , the velocity dispersion of the star - forming gas ( @xmath3 ) follows a scaling relation @xmath4+@xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the star formation surface density and the constant includes the stellar surface density ) . assuming the disks are marginally stable ( toomre @xmath7=1 ) </S>",

    "<S> we also identify eleven @xmath2kpc - scale star - forming regions ( clumps ) within our sample and show that their sizes are comparable to the wavelength of the fastest growing mode . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosities and velocity dispersions of these clumps follow the same scaling relations as local hii regions , although their star formation densities are a factor @xmath215@xmath105@xmath21 higher than typically found locally . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how the clump properties are related to the disk , and show that their high masses and luminosities are a consequence of the high disk surface density . </S>"
