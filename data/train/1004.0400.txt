    "a binary deletion channel @xmath8 is defined as a binary channel that drops bits of the input sequence independently with probability @xmath1 . those bits",
    "that are not dropped simply pass through the channel unaltered .",
    "while simple to describe , the deletion channel proves to be very difficult to analyze .",
    "dobrushin ( @xcite ) showed that for such a channel it is possible to define a capacity @xmath0 and that a shannon like theorem applies to this channel .",
    "however , no closed formula expression is known up to now for the capacity @xmath0 , and only upper and lower bounds are currently available ( see @xcite ) .    for small values of @xmath1 ,",
    "it was recently independently proved in @xcite and @xcite that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the binary entropy function . for values of @xmath1 close to @xmath11 ,",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that @xmath0 satisfies @xmath12    as far as the author knows , there is no result in the literature on the existence of @xmath4 . in this paper",
    ", it is proved that the limit exists and , in particular , that @xmath13    the best currently known upper bound for @xmath0 , when used in the right hand side of , leads to the upper bound @xmath14 which improves the best previously known bound of equation .",
    "furthermore , equation suggests the conjecture that @xmath0 may be a convex function of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , as discussed in section [ sec : neard1 ] below , experimental evidence ( see figure [ fig : basebounds ] ) suggests the convexity of @xmath0 for values of @xmath1 sufficiently smaller than @xmath11 , while it is not easy to exclude that the function may be concave near @xmath15 .",
    "equation is only a necessary condition that satisfy equation , when used in place of @xmath0 , but are not convex in any neighborhood of @xmath15 . ] for the convexity of @xmath0 near @xmath15 .",
    "it is , however , sufficient to conclude that @xmath0 is not strictly concave in any neighborhood of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , either @xmath0 exhibit a pathological behavior near @xmath15 , or it is convex in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath15 .",
    "a proof of the convexity of @xmath0 would of course imply equation and thus equation .",
    "the main idea used in this paper is the intuitive fact that , for a large enough number of input bits @xmath16 , the deletion channel @xmath8 is fairly well approximated by a channel which drops exactly @xmath17 $ ] bits selected uniformly at random . in particular , we show that a channel @xmath18 with @xmath16-bits input and @xmath19-bits output , selected uniformly within the @xmath19-bits subsequences of the input , has a capacity that is close to @xmath20 for large enough @xmath16 . using this result",

    "figure [ fig : basebounds ] shows the graph of the @xmath29 functions for @xmath30 .",
    "the main objective of this section is to study the convergence of the @xmath29 functions to deduce a regularity result for @xmath0 .",

    "thus , @xmath40 is a markov chain .",
    "hence , @xmath41 this implies by fekete s lemma ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "hence , if proved that the @xmath29 are continuous in @xmath1 , so is their limit @xmath0 .",
    "since the domain of @xmath0 is compact , by the heine - cantor theorem @xmath0 is also uniformly continuous .",
    "that the @xmath29 functions are continuous is really intuitive ; the shortest formal proof that we were able to provide goes as follows .",
    "the entries of the transition matrix of the channel @xmath25 are polynomials in @xmath1 and thus the mutual information @xmath60 is a continuous function of @xmath1 and of the input distribution @xmath61 .",
    "hence , by moving @xmath1 continuously from @xmath62 to @xmath11 one expects the capacity to change continuously from @xmath11 to @xmath62 . a formal proof , however , seems to require using the compactness of the sets of distributions @xmath61 .",
    "assume that @xmath29 is not continuous in @xmath63 and let @xmath64 be the input distribution that attains the value @xmath65 .",
    "then there exists an @xmath66 such that @xmath67 for a sequence @xmath68 converging to @xmath69 .",
    "consider the distributions @xmath70 that attain @xmath71 .",
    "since the set of the @xmath61 is bounded and closed , there exists a subsequence of the @xmath72 that converges to a distribution @xmath73 . by continuity of the mutual information the @xmath71 values tend to the mutual information @xmath74 attained by @xmath73 in @xmath63 .",
    "but , by definition of @xmath65 , we clearly have that @xmath75 and thus @xmath76 for @xmath19 large enough .",
    "but then the mutual information attained by @xmath64 in @xmath68 tends to @xmath77 for large enough @xmath19 , which is absurd by definition of @xmath71 .",

    "this channel was efficiently used as an auxiliary channel in @xcite .",
    "let then @xmath80    the following obvious result will be used later .",
    "[ l : k1k2 ] for every random @xmath81 , if @xmath82 then @xmath83    simply note that the @xmath84 channel can be obtained as a cascade of @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",

    "the following lemma bounds the capacity of the @xmath25 channel in terms of the capacity of certain exact deletion channels .",

    "the capacity of the exact deletion channel @xmath18 in terms of @xmath0 for appropriate values of @xmath1 .    for",

    "so , @xmath118 is bounded by the difference between the right hand side and the left hand side of equation , that is @xmath119 with the notation of lemma [ l : unifcont ] , take @xmath120 so that @xmath121 .",
    "once @xmath122 is fixed , choose @xmath123 such that @xmath124 to complete the proof .",
    "note that @xmath123 is a function of @xmath125 only and that the result holds for every @xmath78 .",

    "[ l : limitnk ] let @xmath126 be an integer valued sequence such that @xmath127 tends to @xmath128 as @xmath16 goes to infinity .",

    "in this section , we finally focus on the behavior of the function @xmath0 for values of @xmath1 close to 1 .",
    "it is interesting to observe in figure [ fig : basebounds ] that , from experimental evidence , the @xmath29 functions seem to be convex in a progressively expanding region of @xmath1 values . on the one hand , it is tempting to conjecture that the limit @xmath0 is convex in the whole interval @xmath6 $ ] . on the other hand , near @xmath15 , all the @xmath29 curves appear to change concavity and go to zero asymptotically as @xmath130 . indeed",
    ", we have the following result .",
    "[ lemma : cnd1 ] for every @xmath16 , @xmath131    it is easily shown that for every @xmath16 and @xmath1 @xmath132 the right hand side inequality follows from the fact that the capacity of @xmath25 is obviously smaller than the capacity of a binary erasure channel with erasure probability @xmath1 . to prove the left hand side inequality consider using as input to the channel @xmath25 only the sequence composed of @xmath16 zeros and that composed of @xmath16 ones .",
    "then the @xmath16 uses of @xmath25 correspond to one use of an erasure channel with erasure probability @xmath133 .",
    "this proves equation .",
    "dividing by @xmath130 and taking the limit @xmath134 gives the required result .",
    "lemma [ lemma : cnd1 ] ensures that , for fixed @xmath16 , @xmath29 is not convex in a neighborhood of @xmath15 .",
    "note further that @xmath135 hence , it is natural to believe that @xmath29 is actually concave in a neighborhood of @xmath15 , even if lemma [ lemma : cnd1 ] is not sufficient to prove this .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath136 , it is known ( see @xcite ) that @xmath0 satisfies @xmath137 hence , lemma [ lemma : cnd1 ] does not hold with @xmath0 in place of @xmath29 and it is still legitimate to conjecture that @xmath0 may be convex in @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "the next step is thus to ask if @xmath138 has a limit as @xmath134 and , if so , if this limit is reached from above as would be implied by convexity of @xmath0 . the remaining part of this section tries to answer this question .    in order to understand the behavior of @xmath0 near @xmath15 ,",
    "the following result from @xcite is fundamental .",
    "[ l : fertonani ] for every @xmath139 @xmath140    in @xcite the authors state that , for every @xmath16 and @xmath19 , @xmath141 .",
    "however , we are not aware of a previous formal proof that @xmath142 exists . this fact is proved in the following theorem .",
    "[ th : limeqinf ] it holds that @xmath143    for every @xmath144 , let @xmath126 be a sequence such that @xmath127 tends to @xmath145 .",
    "then , from theorem [ l : limitnk ] , the right hand side of , with @xmath126 in place of @xmath19 , tends to @xmath146 . since @xmath147 is arbitrary , lemma [ l : fertonani ] implies that @xmath148 .",
    "however , it is obvious that @xmath149 .",
    "thus @xmath4 exists and is equal to @xmath150    a direct consequence of theorem [ th : limeqinf ] is the following improved bound on @xmath0 .",
    "[ cor : newbound ] @xmath151    as far as the author knows , the best known numerical bound obtained for @xmath152 is @xmath153 obtained using the bound @xmath154 , numerically evaluated in @xcite .",
    "the usefulness of theorem [ th : limeqinf ] is that it allows to deduce provable bounds for @xmath155 from bounds on @xmath0 even with @xmath1 much smaller than 1 .",
    "it is interesting to note , in fact , that different techniques seem to be effective in bounding @xmath0 in different regions of the interval @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "for example , different genie aided channels are used in @xcite for smaller values of @xmath1 than for large values of @xmath1 and , while equation is derived in @xcite using a bound effective for large @xmath1 , the bound for @xmath156 used in corollary [ cor : newbound ] is derived from the numerical value of @xmath157 which is not as effective for @xmath1 larger than @xmath158 ( see table iv in @xcite , where bound @xmath159 therein is what we called @xmath157 , while bound @xmath160 is used to deduce ) .",
    "thus , in order to obtain improved upper bounds for @xmath155 one effective approach would be to numerically evaluate @xmath29 near @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "this requires , however , high computational and spatial complexity and it is out of the scope of the present paper .",
