    "to classify all indecomposable objects in a category of representations is usually a challenging and difficult problem .",
    "it is often the case that there are not enough projectives or the category itself is wild .",
    "a classical example of a wild category with enough projectives is the category @xmath11 introduced by bernstein - gelfand - gelfand in 1967 .",
    "the simple objects in this category are highest weight modules , and the indecomposable projectives are described by the celebrated bgg reciprocity law .    a natural generalization of the category @xmath12 is the category of all weight ( not necessarily highest weight ) modules .",
    "weight modules have attracted considerable mathematical attention in the last 20 years and appeared in works of g. benkart , d. britten , s. fernando , v. futorny , and f. lemire , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a major breakthrough was the recent classification of o. mathieu , @xcite , of all simple weight modules with finite weight multiplicities over finite dimensional reductive lie algebras . a crucial role in this classification",
    "is played by the category @xmath1 of bounded weight modules , i.e. those for which the set of weight multiplicities is uniformly bounded .",
    "this is due to the fact that , as fernando showed in @xcite , every simple weight module @xmath13 with finite weight multiplicities is obtained by a parabolic induction from a simple module @xmath14 in @xmath1 ( in fact @xmath14 has equal weight multiplicities ) .",
    "an important observation of mathieu is that the direct sum of all simple objects in a single block of @xmath9 form a so - called coherent family which is parameterized by a highest weight module , i.e. an object in @xmath11 .    in the present paper",
    "we initiate a study of the category of bounded modules .",
    "a result of fernando shows that infinite dimensional bounded weight modules exist only for lie algebras of type @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . as a first step in our project we consider the lie algebra @xmath17",
    "this case is simpler in terms of the classification of mathieu as a semisimple irreducible coherent family over @xmath18 is determined uniquely by its central character .",
    "the case of @xmath19 is more delicate and one has to consider three separate cases for the central character : regular integral , singular , and nonintegral .",
    "one of the main results in the paper is providing a complete classification of all indecomposable projective objects in @xmath1 .",
    "an interesting observation is that if @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21 , the category @xmath22 does not contain any projective objects .",
    "the picture is totally different for the higher dimensional algebras as for @xmath6 each simple object has a projective cover .    in order to describe the indecomposable objects of @xmath9 we first show that this category is equivalent to the category of weight modules over the weyl algebra @xmath23 ( see lemma [ lm7 ] and corollary [ cor3 ] ) .",
    "we then conclude that each block @xmath24 of @xmath9 is equivalent to the category of a certain quiver with relations .",
    "this quiver is wild if and only if @xmath7 . in the case",
    "@xmath8 indecomposable representations of the quiver can be expressed in terms of the affine quiver @xmath10 , the theory of which is well established .",
    "in addition , in section [ explic ] we provide an explicit description of all indecomposable bounded modules over @xmath25 in terms of the twisted localization correspondence .",
    "we show also that there are not enough projectives in the category of all weight @xmath26-modules with finite weight multiplicities ( see example [ exproj ] ) which provides an additional motivation to focus our attention on the bounded modules only .",
