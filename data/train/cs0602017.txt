    "different mechanical properties of biological tissues depend on mineral content . thus , roughly , it can be distinguished two classes of biological tissues . bones and tooth content mineral ,",
    "they conform the group known as hard tissues . whereas , skin , muscle , blood vessel and lungs conform the second group called of soft tissues .",
    "they do not content mineral , so they are much deformable than hard tissues .",
    "modelling the mechanical behavior of soft tissues has much in common with those techniques used to model rubber elasticity .",
    "thus , finite deformation theories useful for rubber elasticity are often used to describe soft tissue mechanical behavior . however , there are significant differences in the material structure of soft tissues and rubber elasticity . moreover ,",
    "in the way they respond under applied stress .",
    "soft tissue material achieve initially large stretch under relatively low level of stress and subsequent stiffening at higher level extensions .",

    ", newton s law balance of forces maybe could not be efficient to write equations of motion for each connectors , known their mechanical properties .",
    "naturally , because the number of particles to be considered is excessively large , and the way to specify the interaction forces between particles becomes very complex .",
    "instead , it is much better to consider the body as a continuum , searching for a simplified way to specify interaction forces between particles by means of constitutive equations , and so thus specifying realistic properties of materials .",
    "a stress - strain relationship describes the mechanical property of a material and it is therefore a constitutive equation .",
    "research on modelling soft tissue mechanical behavior has a growing demand for applications in surgical simulations , pursuing for in real time fast and precise calculations of tissue deformations . in trying for these commitments",
    ", it has been introduced models accounting for the continuous nature of soft tissue . within the limits of the employed constitutive model",
    "the finite element methods allows for physically correct simulation of the tissue mechanics @xcite .",
    "for other side , alternative discrete approaches based on spring - mass model have also been applied@xcite .",
    "it seems that methods based on the continuum approach are more appropriated to describe much better realistic soft tissue mechanical behavior , whereas spring - mass based models being economics are less accurate than the former .",
    "the main issue of our research look for an appropriate way to establish an accurate comparison between these methodologies .",
    "in this work we review some physic models applicable to modelling soft tissue mechanical behavior and we also discuss some perspective in the field .",
    "this work is organized as follow : in section  [ sec : continuum ] we present the continuum approach formalism , and we also consider particular mathematical results for linear elastic solids and fluids . important testing methods on physics necessaries to characterize soft tissue mechanical behavior , i.e , strain , creep and relaxation , are presented in section  [ sec : testmeth ] .",

    "the equations of motion for a continuum were derived by euler , using newton s laws and supported on the follow axioms : _ i _ ) the material particles form a one - to - one isomorphism with real numbers in a @xmath1 euclidean space . _",
    "ii _ ) the mass distribution is characterized by the density @xmath2 ( the mass per unit volume ) , it is defined as a piecewise continuous function over the volume of the continuum .",
    "_ iii _ ) solely neighbors particle interactions are regarded .",
    "a surface is conformed by particles , it could be considered arbitrarily infinitesimal . in a continuum",
    ", oriented surfaces interaction can be expressed as a surface traction ( force per unit area ) , that can be computed from a well defined stress tensor ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "let us @xmath4 be an inertial cartesian frame of reference , and an infinitesimal volume by @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the stress and strain tensor , respectively .",
    "let us denote : @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; the velocity vector , the acceleration vector and the body force per unit volume , respectively .",
    "we now recall newton s balance of forces , stating that the material rate of change of the linear momentum of a body must be equal to the resultant of forces applied to the body . in follow , we write it in the form of euler s equation , for more details see @xcite :    @xmath9    using tensor notation , a repetition of an index in any given term means a summation over the range of that index , @xmath10 in the spatial description , @xmath11    by taking into account the conservation of mass , expressed by the equation of continuity : @xmath12 eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : one ] ) becomes , @xmath13 this is valid for any continuum , whether it is a fluid or a solid .    in particular , if the material is considered to be incompressible , regarded @xmath14 is a constant",
    "; we get from the eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : two ] ) , @xmath15 from here , further development requires specification of the properties of the material in the form of constitutive equations , relating stress with strain or strain rate ; or strain history . in order to have a complete theory ,",
    "all these constitutive relationship must be incorporated into eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : three ] ) .    using our faculty perceptions we can verify : booth skin and muscle have a definite shape , they even can sustain a shear force , and maintains a quasi - static state ( i.e. stress is a function of strain ) .",
    "therefore , their mechanical behavior is analogous to that one of a solid . whereas considering blood ( at least in normal conditions ) we note",
    ": it has no shape , it can not sustain a shear force ( because it is in motion ) , and given its dynamic state ; the stress is a function of the rate of strain .",
    "thus it behaves mechanically like a fluid .",
    "next , we derive particular equations for isotropic solid materials which follow hook s elastic law and also for newtonian fluids using euler s formalism , incorporating specific constitutive relationships .",
    "these kind of materials obey the following stress - strain linear relationship : @xmath16 which alternative inverse relationship can be re - written as , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the stress and strain tensors , @xmath20 is the lam constant , @xmath21 is the shear modulus , @xmath22 is the young s modulus and @xmath23 is the poisson s ratio .",
    "@xmath24 is the kronecker delta ( unity if @xmath25 , otherwise is zero ) .",
    "we see here that , the strain is being referred to a configuration of the body in which it is null provided that the stress is zero .    substituting eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : five ] ) into eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : three ] ) we arrived to , @xmath26 lets now denote the vector displacement of a point in the body by @xmath27 , which is measured with respect to an inertial cartesian frame of reference .",
    "if @xmath28 is infinitesimal , we can define , @xmath29 to the same order of approximation , @xmath30 on substituting all these equations into eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : six ] ) , it is obtained the well known navier s equation : @xmath31 where the poissons ratio @xmath32 . in this way",
    ", we arrived to the basic field equation of the linearized theory of elasticity .",
    "however , living bodies often take on finite deformations , obey so more complex nonlinear constitutive equations than the above presented .",
    "these fluids obey the following stress - strain - rate relationship , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the pressure , @xmath35 is the dynamic viscosity ( a constant parameter ) , and @xmath36 is the bulk elasticity ( second coefficient of viscosity ) . if the fluid is incompressible , according to eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : four ] ) , this expression simplified to , @xmath37 by substituting it into eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : two ] ) , we obtain the navier - stokes equation , valid for newtonian fluids , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fluid kinematic viscosity .",
    "appropriate boundary conditions are necessary in order to solve the current equation .    air and water are newtonian fluids .",
    "non - newtonian fluids do not obey constitutive equations (  [ eqn : twelve ] ) . like blood ,",
    "most body fluids are non - newtonian . however at a shear strain rate above @xmath40 blood is almost newtonian .    in general , soft tissues present unique mechanical properties . in the next section we present some basic test methods useful to describe quantitative soft tissue mechanical properties .",
    "the tensile test method consists to measure deformation of an specimen while a force being applied to a sample is gradually increased . during the stretching process are measured both , the stress and the strain .",
    "the former is obtained taking the ratio of the force and the material cross sectional area , whereas the latter is derived dividing the displacement and the original material length .",
    "analyzing the stress - strain curve provides useful information : as said the young s module , the yield point and the ultimate tensile strength .",
    "the young s module is obtained taking the slope of the linear stress - strain curve .",
    "the yield strength corresponds to the value of the stress at the yield point , generically calculated by plotting young s module at a specified percent of offset ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the ultimate tensile strength corresponds to the highest value of stress on the stress - strain curve .",
    "computing the area under the stress - strain curve we determine the fracture energy .",
    "meanwhile , viscoelastic properties of soft tissues can be determined by creep and relaxation tests .",
    "creep properties are determined subjecting the specimen under prolonged constant tension or compression , and the deformation is measured at specified times intervals .",
    "then , a creep ( deformation ) versus time diagram is plotted , and the creep - rate is obtained by taking the slope of curve at any point .",
    "provided failure occurs , the test is finished and the time for rupture is recorded .",
    "if the specimen does not fracture within the test period , creep recovery may be measured too .",
    "the stress - relaxation of a material is obtained taking the specimen deformed a given amount and recording the actual stress over prolonged period of exposure , and the stress - relaxation - rate is the slope of the curve at any point .     is achieved with more facility than for nuchal ligament ( elastin ) , it is also more viscoelastic than the others tissues , because it shows a wider hysteresis loop .",

    "once the biologic specimen is subjected to test methods as described above , their mechanical properties are obtained . in follow",
    "we describe more basic soft tissue mechanical properties .      ,",
    "width=321,height=321 ]    biological soft tissues are mainly composed of cells and intercellular substances .",
    "the later consisting of connective tissues such as collagen , elastin and ground substance(hydrophilic gel ) .",
    "these components present different physical and chemical properties , and their contents differ from tissue to tissue and even from location to location within a tissue .",
    "thus , mechanical properties depend both on tissue and on site .",
    "collagen is a protein which gives mechanical integrity and strength to our bodies , it is presented in different structural forms in different tissues and organs .",
    "elastin is also a protein , unlike to collagen has a much less integrated structure .",
    "it has much less strength and much more flexibility than collagen .",
    "figure (  [ fig : two ] ) shows the stress - strain relationship for soft tissues rich in collagen , elastin and smooth muscle ( cell)@xcite . there we can see that , the elastin - rich nuchal ligament has much less strength and much more flexibility than the collagen - rich sole tendon , whereas the intestinal smooth muscle is much softer than the other soft tissues , which also shows a wider hysteresis loop ; indicating that it is viscoelastic .",
    "biological soft tissues are mechanically nonlinear , this is enhanced by assembly of structural component into a tissue .",
    "the behavior of arterial walls at low tension is similar to that of elastin , while the behavior at high tension is the same as that of collagen .",
    "collagen and elastin are long - chained polymers , so they are intrinsically anisotropic . in order to work effectively , not only their fibers but also cells are oriented in tissues and organs .",
    "skin for example has very different properties in two orthogonal directions .",
    "this is shown in figure (  [ fig : three ] ) , where extensions under different applied values of tension were measured . in this test method ,",
    "tension consists to subject the specimen to pre - determined value of force , i.e. @xmath42 ; the subindex recall for the direction , whereas the extension @xmath43 is measured , taking the ratio of material length under the actual tension and its original one ( when the tension is null ) .",
    "note here that the sample achieves it original length when the tension value is zero .",
    "analogously , collagen fibers in the articular cartilage also shows anisotropic mechanical behavior@xcite .",
    "this is presented in figure (  [ fig : four ] ) , where are shown different stress - strain curve responses for different orientations , i.e.@xmath44 degrees .",
    "most rheologist would restrict using of the label non - newtonian fluid to substances which , because they possess long structural relaxation times , are non linear and tend to remember their past history . for almost all the biological soft tissues",
    "the curve stress - strain exhibit hysteresis loop , as it was shown in figure (  [ fig : one ] ) for elastin , collagen and soft muscle , meaning that they are viscoelastic .",
    "however , viscoelastic behavior is distinguished more clearly by relaxation test .",
    "for example , as it is shown in figure (  [ fig : five ] ) , when the patellar tendon is elongated a given amount and the actual stress does not stay at a specific level but decreases rather rapidly at first and then gradually@xcite .    generically speaking , under different strain rates ( test speed ) biological soft tissues are mechanically not very sensitive .",
    "in addition , the area of the hysteresis loop does not depend on the strain rate .",
    "most biological tissues hardly change their volume even if load is applied , so they are almost incompressible@xcite .",
    "they have a water content of more than 70 @xmath45 .",
    "however , articular cartilage is an exception , because is a micro - porous tissue , therefore water can enter an leave pores depending upon load@xcite .",
    "the incompressibility assumption is a very important ingredient in constitutive laws formulation , imposing that adding overall principal strains is always zero .",
    "biological soft tissue can support large deformations which are nonlinear and extensive . in reducing the experimental data to a stress - strain relationship , it is used the nominal stress @xmath46 ( getting dividing the force by the original cross sectional area specimen at zero stress ) .",
    "the most striking feature of this relationship is revealed in figure (  [ fig : six ] ) when the slope of the stress - extension curve is plotted against @xmath46 .",
    "we can fit the experimental data to a straight line , as first approximation , @xmath47 where @xmath36 is the extension ratio , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constants depending of the material . prescribed @xmath50 , @xmath51 , from eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : thirteen ] ) we obtain , @xmath52}\\,-\\,1\\right\\ } \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] several other types of soft tissue such as the skin , the muscles , the ureter , the lung tissue , and articular cartilage are found to follow similar relationship , figure (  [ fig : seven ] ) .",
    "so , it appears that the exponential type of stress - strain relationship is common to biological tissue .",
    "realistically , in vivo tissues are not expose to such a pure tensile force conditions .",
    "therefore , under more realistic mechanical conditions multi - axial test are often used to determine soft tissue mechanical behavior .",
    "so in several cases we need more equations .",
    "naturally , for a three - dimensional organ we need a three - dimensional stress - strain law .",
    "no general constitutive equations has been identified for living tissues .",
    "strain energy functions are used to describe the mechanical tissue properties .",
    "the main idea is that if a pseudo - elastic strain energy function exist , then the stress - strain relationship can be obtained by a differentiation .",
    "let @xmath53 be the strain energy per unit mass of a tissue , and @xmath54 be the density in the zero - stress state .",
    "thus @xmath55 is the strain energy per unit volume of a tissue in the zero - stress state , this is called the strain - energy density function .",
    "the strain energy @xmath53 can be expressed in terms of the components @xmath56 of the green strain . in a uni - axial tensile test",
    ", the green strain @xmath57 in the tensile direction is given by @xmath58 the components @xmath59 of the second piola - kirchhoff stress can be obtained by derivatives of the strain energy density function , @xmath60 in a simple uniaxial tensile test , the only non - zero component of stress , denoted by @xmath61 , is @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the initial cross - sectional area sample and the load applied to the specimen , respectively .",
    "equation (  [ eqn : sixteen ] ) is a constitutive law or stress - strain relationship .",
    "thus we need to know the details of the strain - energy functions .",
    "for the strain energy function , studies on non isotropic tissues as skin , muscles , ligaments , etc .",
    ", have shown that the exponential form applies well . a general strain - energy function for biological soft tissues",
    "is given by fung @xcite in the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 are constants .",
    "regarded the complex form of eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : eighteen ] ) high order terms can be dismissed as for skin , considered as being in a bi - axial state , and its strain - energy function is ,    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constants .    following , using eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : sixteen ] ) , we obtain the stresses , @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are functions of the strain components .",
    "it can be verified from figure (  [ fig : three ] ) that eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : nineteen ] ) is suitable for bi - axial mechanical behavior of rabbit skin .",
    "additional terms can be disregarded taking in account physical considerations , if we are concerned mainly with higher stresses and strains the first group of terms in eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : nineteen ] ) can be omitted , in addition for practical purposes third order terms in the exponential function can also be omitted , and we have simply ,    @xmath73      hysteresis , relaxation , and creep are common features of viscoelastic behavior for many materials .",
    "the toy models here presented are basic mechanical models useful describing viscoelastic behavior .",
    "these are composed by a combination of elastic material with elastic constant @xmath35 ( i.e. spring ) and a dashpot containing a fluid with coefficient of viscosity @xmath74 .",
    "a force @xmath75 is suppose to produce on the spring an uniaxial linear deformation , denoted by the displacement @xmath76 , and proportional to @xmath35 .",
    "whereas , at any instant , for the dashpot , it produces a velocity proportional to @xmath74 .",
    "different spring - dashpot arrangements are shown in figure (  [ fig : eight ] ) .",
    "it is remarkable that these classes of discrete models are also useful in the continuum , where relaxation functions are borrowed from these theories .",
    "for example modelling viscoelastic tissue behavior is assumed that the stresses in the material , which themselves may result from a nonlinear stress - strain relation are linearly superposed with respect to time , recalling the quasi - linear viscoelastic formulation , which we present next in subsection (  [ subsec : quase - linear visc ] ) .          in this model an spring and a dashpot",
    "are arranged in serie .",
    "thus , the material behaves like an elastic at short time and it is viscous at long times .",
    "@xmath77 equation (  [ eqn : twentytwo ] ) is solved , prescribed the force @xmath78 is a unit step function , and the result is called the creep function @xmath79 .",
    "it represents the elongation produced by a sudden application of a constant unitary force at @xmath80 , @xmath81 interchanging the role of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we obtain the relaxation function @xmath82 , as a response to a unity elongation , i.e. @xmath83 . the relaxation function is the force that must be applied to the specimen in order to produce an elongation , that changes at @xmath80 from zero to unity , remaining unity thereafter .",
    "@xmath84 with , * 1*(t ) is the step function , @xmath85 in this way , for the maxwell model we found that a sudden application of a load induce an immediate deflection of the elastic spring , followed by a creep of the dashpot , as in eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : twentythree ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", a sudden deformation produces an immediate reaction by the spring followed by stress relaxation according to exponential law , which relaxation time is given by the factor @xmath86 , as in eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : twentyfour ] ) .",
    "let us now regard the spring and the dashpot in parallel , @xmath87 solving eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : twentysix ] ) we obtain the creep and the stress relaxations functions , respectively , @xmath88 where , @xmath89 is the dirac delta function .",
    "regarding eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : twentyseven ] ) we found that , a sudden application of a unity force will produce no immediate spring deflections ; which solely built up gradually , because the dashpot arranged in parallel with the spring will not move instantaneously .",
    "the displacement of the dashpot will relax exponentially with a relaxation time @xmath86 .",
    "this model is also known as the standard linear model .",
    "while models due to maxwell and voigt suppose fluids behave like elastic to some extent , the standard model goes further taking in account the dissipation rate of energy in various materials subjected to cyclic loading , @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the time of relaxation of the load under the condition of constant deflection , whereas @xmath92 is the time of relaxation of deflection under the condition of constant load , and @xmath93 in eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : twentynine ] ) as @xmath94 , the dashpot is completely relaxed and the load - deflection relaxation becomes that of the springs , characterized by the constant @xmath95 , which is called the relaxed elastic modulus .",

    "analogously to the case above , we consider a bar subjected to a force @xmath78 and an elongation @xmath97 .",
    "the elongation is caused by the total history of the loading up to the time @xmath98 .",

    "it contributes an element @xmath102 to the elongation at time @xmath98 , with a proportionality constant @xmath69 , depending on the time interval @xmath103 , then , @xmath104 analogously , for the force , @xmath105 here the functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the creep function and the relaxation function , respectively . more generally , we can write the relaxation function in the form , @xmath108 where @xmath109 is called characteristic frequency and @xmath110 is an amplitude associated to each frequency @xmath111 , it is called a spectrum of the relaxation function . a generalization to a continuum spectrum",
    "is giving in the next section .",
    "the hysteresis @xmath112 is due to viscoelasticity , it is defined as the ratio of the area of the hysteresis loop divided by the area under the loading curve . for biological tissues ,",
    "@xmath112 is seen to be variable , but its variation with strain rate is not large , see section (  [ subsec : visco ] ) .",
    "hence , typical soft tissue behavior shows non - linearity of the stress - strain relationship and insensitivity of the material to strain rate .",
    "models due to maxwell and voigt provide a logarithmic type functional relationship between hysteresis and frequency ( @xmath23 , the inverse of the characteristic time ) , i.e. , @xmath113 .",
    "it is a decreasing curve for the former , whereas it is a increasing curve for the later . on the other hand ,",
    "the standard model presents a bell - shaped curve of hysteresis vs the logarithm of the frequency . summarizing ,",
    "none of these models present a typical flat hysteresis vs frequency curve of living tissues .",
    "however , this fact can be corrected by introducing nonlinear springs . hence , this now suitable model for soft tissues , is composed of a long series of kelvin bodies whose characteristic times ( @xmath114 ) span a broad range .",
    "lets consider an elastic stress tensor @xmath115 , which is a function of the strain tensor @xmath57 .",
    "if the material is in the zero - stress state until the time @xmath80 , then it is suddenly strained to @xmath57 and maintained constant at that value , thus the stress developed will be a function of time as well as of @xmath57 .",
    "hence , the history of the stress development may be written as , @xmath116 in which @xmath117 is called the relaxation function , a normalized function of time .",
    "now , we suppose that the stress response to an infinitesimal changes in a component of strain , @xmath118 , superposed on a specimen in a state of strain @xmath57 at an instant of time @xmath100 , is , for @xmath119 @xmath120 } { \\partial\\mathit{e}_{ij}}\\partial\\mathit{e}_{ij}(\\tau ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in addition , assuming that the stress at time @xmath98 is the sum of the contributions of all the past changes , each governed by the same reduced relaxation function , @xmath121}{\\partial\\mathit{e}_{kl}}\\frac{\\partial\\mathit{e}_{kl}(\\tau ) } { \\partial \\tau } \\,d\\tau \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although @xmath122 may be a nonlinear function of strain , the relaxation process is linear .",

    "in this section we suppose that a physical body is conformed by an ensemble of connected springs . initially is being considered both spring elasticity and spring",
    "dumping responses are linear .",
    "hence , let us consider an elastic body obeying hooke s law .",

    "moreover , it implies that the total work done by a set of forces does not depend of the order in which the forces are applied .",
    "this work done by each force is @xmath141 and the total work done by the system of forces , is stored as strain energy in the elastic body , and it is given by , @xmath142 the matrices @xmath139 and @xmath138 are symmetric . in others",

    "now we can write the equation of motions of a set o masses embedded in an elastic body .",
    "the dalambert s principle establishes that the particles can be considered to be in a state of equilibrium if the inertial forces are applied in reversed direction on the particles .",

    "let recall for the concept of kinetic energy @xmath146 , it is an homogeneous quadratic function of the @xmath147 s , and its rate can be computed from , @xmath148    for a biological system , other forms of energy rather than the kinetic energy @xmath146 can also be involved , such as the gravitational potential @xmath149 , the internal energy @xmath150 , and the chemical energy @xmath151 . according to the first law of thermodynamics ,",
    "the energy of a system solely can be changed by absorption of heat @xmath152 and by doing work on the system .",
    "the rate of change of the total energy must be equal to the sum of the rates of heat input @xmath153 and work done on the system @xmath154 , so , @xmath155 generally , just a certain part of the internal energy function @xmath150 arise from the strain energy , it is a quadratic function of ( generalized ) coordinates @xmath156 .",
    "it can also depend on the temperature . if the temperature remains constant , then the rate at which work is done by the internal energy and also by the forces acting on a system are , respectively , @xmath157 then , substituting them into eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : balance ] ) , @xmath158 now lets consider the special case when @xmath159 because the displacements are independent variables , that can assume arbitrary variables , we impose for any @xmath160 , in eqn .",
    "(  [ eqn : eq - geral00 ] ) , @xmath161 if the ( generalized ) forces are partial derivatives of a function , i.e. , @xmath162 ; where @xmath163 is the potential energy . for the spring body system",
    "the internal elastic energy is given by equation (  [ eqn : elastic ] ) .",
    "thought , @xmath163 and @xmath150 only depend on @xmath164 , the system is conservative .",
    "the aerodynamic or hydrodynamics forces acting on an animal moving in a fluid are not conservative .",
    "hence , for problems involving these forces is much better to use equation (  [ eqn : eq - geral01 ] ) , thought @xmath130 is an external force .",
    "following , we apply the present theory to materials showing viscoelastic behavior ( like tissues ) , in the presence of fluid dynamic forces .      here",
    "we recall the most general constitutive equation of a linear viscoelastic solid reviewed in section  [ subsec : visco ] . applying boltzmann s formulation we may write the internal force acting on a particle @xmath133 , located at point @xmath133 , by a displacement @xmath165 located at point @xmath140 as , @xmath166 where @xmath167 are the relaxation functions . for solid with fading memory ,",
    "it is given by equation (  [ eqn : boltzmann ] ) , @xmath168 where @xmath169 are the relaxation frequencies , @xmath170 are spectral constants .",
    "for systems subjected to fluid dynamics forces ( i.e. , in swimming , in wind or with internal flow ) , the external force at the point @xmath133 due to motion at point @xmath140 may be written as , @xmath171 where @xmath172 are aerodynamic influence functions , which is un - symmetric .",

    "more general mechanical properties of a material can be specified by mean of constitutive equations .",
    "remarkable , the continuum approach naturally adds constitutive equations into more generalized theories .",
    "however , it seems that soft tissue models based on these more general theories are numerically expensive , hence that linear elasticity approaches have been preferentially considered .    on the other hand , spring - mass models present another alternative to model soft tissue mechanical behavior .",
    "because of physical model simplicity and easier implementation , it has been preferentially used on applications for surgical simulations .",
    "the method is economic and fast , so it is a good candidate to operate in real time .",
    "however , until it is of our knowledge , its numerical implementation has been done no far away from the limits of linearity , not only regarding elasticity but even viscoelasticty .    in this work",
    "we have review some possible alternative models considering nonlinear elasticity and quasi - linear viscoelasticity on spring - mass models .",
    "the former can be naturally filling up by adding to the model exponential type deformations , as in section  [ tissuemath - spring ] .",
    "viscoelastic mechanical behavior can be added to the model using quasi linear models based on boltzmann type approach , as shown in section  [ sec : vibsyst - fuid ] .",
    "summarizing , these are the formulations we are going to explore in order to better model soft tissues .",
    "the resulting model will be validate by comparison with accurate models based on the continuum approach .",
    "we shall stress that because of simplicity and economy , this more elaborated spring - mass models can still handle to perform real time calculations .",
    "recently , holzapfeld @xcite and ogden @xcite have investigated numerical method based on the continuum approach in order to regard nonlinear elasticity and viscoelastic response on arterial walls and soft tissues .",
