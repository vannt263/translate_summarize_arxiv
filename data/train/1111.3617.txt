    "this paper is concerned with mathematics of diffraction .",
    "more specifically we are interested in the famous inverse problem for diffraction : given something that is putatively the diffraction of something , what are all the somethings that could have produced this diffraction .",
    "diffraction has been a mainstay in crystallography for almost a hundred years . with the proliferation of extraordinary new materials with varying degrees of order and disorder",
    ", the importance of diffraction in revealing internal structure continues to be central .",
    "the precision , complexity , and variety of modern diffraction images is striking , see for instance the recent review article @xcite . nonetheless , in spite of many advances ,",
    "the fundamental question of diffraction , the inverse problem of deducing physical structure from diffraction images , remains as challenging as ever .",
    "the discovery of aperiodic tilings and quasicrystals revived interest in the mathematics of diffraction , particularly since the types of diffraction images generated by such structures  essentially or exactly pure point diffraction together with symmetries not occurring in ordinary crystals  had not been foreseen by mathematicians , crystallographers , or materials research scientists .",
    "starting with @xcite , the resulting new techniques created in order to understand mathematical diffraction have been considerable . among them",
    "we mention the introduction of ideas from the harmonic analysis of translation bounded measures @xcite , ergodic dynamical systems @xcite , and stochastic point processes @xcite .",
    "the diffraction of a structure is defined as the fourier transform of its autocorrelation .",
    "the latter is a positive - definite measure in the ambient space of the structure  typically @xmath0 , but mathematically any locally compact abelian group @xmath1  and the diffraction is then a centrally symmetric positive measure in the corresponding fourier reciprocal space  either @xmath2 or generally @xmath3 as the case may be .    in this paper",
    "we examine three basic questions that arise from this theory .",
    "the first question asks whether _ every _ positive centrally symmetric measure is actually the diffraction of something .",
    "the second asks about the classification of the all various ` somethings ' that have this given diffraction .",
    "the third asks what kinds of structures the ` somethings ' can be . in the case of pure point diffraction ( when the diffraction measure is a pure point measure ) we can give a satisfactory answer to these problems .",
    "we will be in the setting of locally compact abelian groups .",
    "the difficulties of the questions , at least as we examine them here , have little to do with the generality of the setting .",
    "they are just as hard for @xmath0 .",
    "indeed the second question is a very old one in crystallography , called the _ homometry problem _ and is part of _ the _ fundamental problem of diffraction theory , namely how to unravel the nature of a structure that has created a given diffraction pattern .",
    "our first question immediately raises the third question . exactly what do we mean by a structure that can diffract ?",
    "typically diffractive structures are conceived of as discrete measures , for instance point measures describing the positions of atoms , vertices in tilings , etc . , weighted by appropriate scattering strengths , or as continuous measures describing the ( scattering ) distribution of the material structure in space .",
    "more recently , starting with the work of gour @xcite there has been a shift to discussing the diffraction of certain point processes , which in effect are random point measures , and various distortions of these ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we are led to introduce new structures which we call a _ spatial stationary processes_. we shall show that these always lead to autocorrelation and diffraction measures and contain the typical theories of diffraction discussed above . in terms of these",
    "we get an attractive answer our three questions , in the case of pure point diffraction . however , the answer to the third question is interesting , because it does not describe the underlying structure explicitly , but rather in terms of the ways that it appears to compactly supported continuous functions on the ambient space . in this respect",
    "it resembles the description of measures given by the riesz representation theorem or the theory of distributions with their spaces of test functions . in our case",
    ", the convergence conditions of measures do not seem to be generally valid . in this respect",
    "there is much to be learned about the full scope of which structures can diffract .",
    "let @xmath1 be a locally compact abelian group and @xmath4 its dual group .",
    "we treat these groups in additive notation .",
    "we begin with an abstract notion of a stationary process for @xmath1 and then shift our attention to the more concrete notion of a spatial stationary process for @xmath1 (  [ stochasticprocesses ] and  [ spatial ] ) . as for terminology",
    "let us note that outside of the discussion of usual stochastic processes , the word ` stochastic ' is not used in our discussion of processes and stationary processes .",
    "a spatial stationary process basically consists of a @xmath1-invariant mapping @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a probability space on which there is a measure preserving action of @xmath1 .",
    "the idea here derives directly from the theory of stochastic point processes , and it is perhaps useful to discuss this briefly .",
    "we follow @xcite here .",
    "a stochastic point process , say in @xmath7 , is a random variable @xmath8 on a probability space @xmath9 with values in the space @xmath10 of point measures @xmath11 on @xmath7 for which @xmath12 for all bounded subsets @xmath13 of @xmath7 .",
    "these are point measures and can be written in the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 can be a positive integer or infinity and the points @xmath16 are ( not necessarily distinct ) points of @xmath7 . usually the space @xmath10 is far larger than needed .",
    "for one thing it allows points in @xmath7 to appear with multiplicities and for another it does not require any minimal separation between distinct points ( a hard core condition ) that would usually be imposed in crystallography or in tiling theories . we assume then that we are really only interested in some subset @xmath17 of permissible outcomes for the point process , and that almost surely the point process produces measures in @xmath18 .",
    "typically we wish @xmath18 to be invariant under translation since the position of our point sets is not particularly relevant , and we assume that the law @xmath19 of the process ( the probability measure @xmath19 induced on @xmath18 by the random variable ) is invariant under translation ( i.e. the process is stationary ) .",
    "now the point is this . if @xmath20 then we obtain a random variable on @xmath9 by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the measure indicated above . in effect",
    "@xmath23 can be viewed as a mapping from @xmath24 into mappings on @xmath18 . under mild assumptions @xmath25 . as is often the case with random variables , we ignore the underlying probability space @xmath9 since we have everything we need from the probability space @xmath6 and the mapping @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath23 itself can be referred to as the stochastic point process .    in this paper @xmath7",
    "is replaced by any locally compact abelian group @xmath1 . also @xmath18 is not assumed to have any particular form ( e.g. a set of point sets , or a set of measures ) .",
    "we do not wish to assume any particular mathematical structure on the outcomes of the processes we are studying .",
    "our point of view is that we will start with a measure in @xmath4 which we would like to show is the diffraction of something .",
    "but we do not know in advance what sort of mathematical objects could produce this diffraction ( point sets , continuous distributions of density , schwartz distributions , etc . ) .",
    "we derive information about @xmath18 only from the behaviour of the functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , upon it .",
    "this is , physically , rather appropriate . in a physical situation",
    "one determines the structure of a physical object by measurements upon it and the results of measurements are ultimately all that one can know about it .",
    "we are particularly interested in pure point diffraction .",
    "however , the concept of stationary processes seems interesting in its own right and we develop the theory of these a bit , independent of the question of pure point diffraction .",
    "it is even useful initially to ignore the fact that the resulting process is _ spatial _ , that is , it is supposed to result from some structure in @xmath1 .",
    "so at the beginning we often only require that we have a @xmath1-invariant mapping @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a hilbert space with conjugation  we call these stationary processes . assuming existence of second moments , we can then , for each such process , find an ` autocorrelation measure ' on @xmath1 and a ` diffraction measure ' on @xmath4 .",
    "the latter is always a centrally symmetric positive measure , and through it we can define continuous and pure point diffraction .",
    "we show how pure point and continuous diffraction are tied to notions of almost periodicity of @xmath23 .",
    "also we show how to decompose a sum of spatial processes into sub - processes which are respectively pure point and continuous .    coming to the pure point part of the paper ,  [ purepoint ] ,",
    "we assume given a centrally symmetric positive pure point measure @xmath30 on @xmath4 , which can be expressed as a fourier transform .",
    "we wish to create a probability space @xmath6 on which there is an ergodic action of @xmath1 and a continuous stationary process @xmath31 whose diffraction is @xmath30 .",
    "not surprisingly phase factors play a crucial role in this since it is phase information that is lost in the process of diffraction .",
    "there is a natural combinatorial type of group @xmath32 generated by the positions of the bragg peaks .",
    "this group can be seen as an abeleanized homotopy group of an associated cayley graph .",
    "it is the dual group of @xmath32 , or the dual group of a natural factor @xmath33 of this group , that classifies all the spatial processes on @xmath1 with diffraction @xmath30 , the classification being up to isomorphism or up to translational isomorphism respectively .",
    "we call these phase factors _ phase forms_. background on phase forms is given in section [ cycles ] . in  [ cyclestostochasticprocesses ]",
    "we show how to use @xmath30 and a phase form @xmath34 to construct a spatial process whose diffraction is @xmath30 .",
    "uniqueness is already shown in  [ uniqueness ] .",
    "how all these ingredients give a solution to the homometry problem is discussed in  [ homometry ] .",
    "our solution to the pure point problem is in some sense an elaboration of the famous halmos - von neumann result about realizing ergodic pure point dynamical systems in terms of the character theory of compact abelian groups .",
    "there the objective was to classify pure pointedness at the level of the spectrum . in our case",
    "we wish to classify the diffraction , which amounts to not only knowing the spectrum but also the intensity of diffraction at each point of the spectrum .",
    "our approach to the construction of a spatial process is to realize @xmath18 as the dual to the discrete group generated by the set of bragg peaks , but at the same time to include all the phase information which derives from the bragg intensities . in this context",
    "we mention the recent work of robinson @xcite on how to realize systems with a given group of eigenvalues via so called cut - and - project schemes .",
    "in  [ compactg ] we take a closer look at the situation that the underlying group is compact . in this case",
    "all processes can be realized as measure processes under some weak assumption .",
    "we then specialize even further and in  [ simpleperiodic ] discuss some results of grnbaum and moore on rational diffraction from one dimensional periodic structures .",
    "these pertain to the simple case that @xmath35 , but even so , the results are interesting and not easy to obtain .    finally in ",
    "[ altconstruction ] we sketch out a second approach to the construction of a spatial process , this time based on gelfand theory .    summarizing :    *",
    "each pure point ergodic spatial process gives rise to a pure point diffraction measure @xmath30 and a phase form @xmath34 .",
    "* spatial processes with the same pure point diffraction measure and the same phase form are naturally isomorphic up to translation .",
    "* the set of all possible phase forms associated with a given pure point measure @xmath30 form an abelian group @xmath36 , and for each choice of @xmath37 , there is a ergodic spatial process with diffraction @xmath30 and phase form @xmath34 .",
    "the paper has two main features , after the introduction of stationary and spatial processes : one is a development of a general theory of these types of processes and the other is a detailed study of pure point diffraction and examples of how it looks in special cases .",
    "readers interested primarily in the pure point theory can skip sections @xmath38 on first reading if they so wish .",
    "in this section we gather some notation used throughout .    @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a locally compact abelian group .",
    "we let @xmath40 denote the space of compactly supported complex valued continuous functions on @xmath1 . for compact @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the subspace of elements of @xmath40 whose support is in @xmath15 . for @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 .",
    "the translation action of @xmath1 on itself is denoted by @xmath45 : @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "this action determines , in the usual way , an action on @xmath40 . by @xmath48",
    "we denote the ( fixed ) haar measure on @xmath1 .",
    "the convolution of two functions @xmath49 is defined to be the function @xmath50 given by @xmath51    the dual group of @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath52 and the _ fouriert ransform _ of an @xmath53 is denoted by @xmath54 i.e. @xmath55    a measure @xmath56 on @xmath1 is called _ transformable _ if there exists a measure @xmath57 on @xmath52 with @xmath58 for all @xmath53 . in this case",
    "@xmath57 is uniquely determined and called the _ fourier transform of @xmath56_. in such a situation we call @xmath57 _ backward transformable_. unlike all other notation introduced in this section the concept of backward transformability is not standard .",
    "however , it is clearly very useful in our context as it is exactly the property shared by the diffraction measures we investigate .",
    "a sequence @xmath59 of compact subsets of @xmath1 is called a _ van hove sequence _ if for every compact @xmath60 @xmath61 here , for compact @xmath62 , the `` @xmath15-boundary '' @xmath63 of @xmath64 is defined as @xmath65 the existence of van hove sequences for all @xmath57-compact locally compact abelian groups is shown in @xcite , see also section 3.3 and theorem ( 3.l ) of ( * ? ? ? * appendix ) .",
    "in this section we introduce our concept of stationary process on the locally compact abelian group @xmath1 . to do so we first discuss some background on unitary representations .",
    "the concept of stationary process is somewhat more general than needed in the remainder of the paper .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : on the one hand this general treatment does not lead to more complicated proofs but rather makes proofs more transparent . on the other hand for a the study of mixed spectra this general concept may prove to be especially useful .",
    "let @xmath1 be a locally compact abelian group and let @xmath29 be a hilbert space with inner product @xmath66 .",
    "we assume linearity in the first variable and conjugate linearity in the second .",
    "a strongly continuous unitary representation of the group @xmath1 on @xmath29 is a map @xmath67 from @xmath1 into the bounded operators on @xmath29 such that @xmath68 is constant on @xmath1 for any @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the identity on @xmath29 , @xmath71 holds for all @xmath72 and @xmath73 is continuous for any @xmath69 .",

    "the conjugation here is the natural one : complex conjugation of functions on @xmath18 . we write @xmath108 .",

    "more precisely , given any spatial stationary process we may create a full process with essentially the same properties by a variant of gelfand construction .",

    "<S> we consider the construction and classification of some new mathematical objects , called ergodic spatial stationary processes , on locally compact abelian groups , which provide a natural and very general setting for studying diffraction and the famous inverse problems associated with it . in particular we can construct complete families of solutions to the inverse problem from any given pure point measure that is chosen to be the diffraction . in this case these processes can be classified by the dual of the group of relators based on the set of bragg peaks , and this gives a solution to the homometry problem for pure point diffraction .    </S>",
    "<S> an ergodic spatial stationary process consists of a measure theoretical dynamical system and a mapping linking it with the ambient space in which diffracting density is supposed to exist . after introducing these processes </S>",
    "<S> we study their general properties and link pure point diffraction to almost periodicity .    given a pure point measure we show how to construct from it and a given set of phases a corresponding ergodic spatial stationary process . </S>",
