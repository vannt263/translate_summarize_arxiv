    "quantification of entanglement of a bipartite state with arbitrary dimensions is a challenging problem and solutions are known only for some special cases with systems consisting of two qubits @xcite , a qubit and a qutrit @xcite , two qudits in a highly symmetric state @xcite , a double gaussian state @xcite , a pure bipartite state @xcite , etc . beyond the bipartite case ,",
    "quantifying the entanglement of a system consisting of three or more parties becomes even more challenging .",
    "for such systems , it becomes important to distinguish between genuinely multipartite entangled states , for which all the parties are entangled with every other party , from the bi - separable states for which some parties might be entangled with each other while being separable from the rest @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that a generalization of wootters concurrence , which was derived for the two - qubit case @xcite , is a good measure to quantify genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "although various witness operations to verify genuine multipartite entanglement existed @xcite , it was not until recently that an analytic expression for @xmath3 was derived @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if a state of an @xmath0-qubit system has an @xmath1 form @xcite , one can get @xmath3 analytically .",
    "the @xmath1-states are density matrices whose only non - zero elements are the diagonal or the anti - diagonal elements when written in an orthonormal product basis of the @xmath0-qubit system . although the properties of @xmath1 density matrices for two - qubit systems are extensively studied in the literature @xcite , the properties of @xmath0-qubit @xmath1 density matrices are still largely unexplored . in this report , we investigate the properties of these @xmath1-states of @xmath0-qubit systems .",
    "in general , an @xmath1-state of @xmath0-qubits has @xmath4 independent real parameters . instead of addressing this exponentially growing parameter space , we restrict our attention only to two fundamental quantities , genuine multipartite concurrence and linear entropy .",
    "linear entropy is a measure of mixedness and for a given state , say @xmath5 , linear entropy is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the dimensionality of @xmath5 .",
    "the linear entropy ranges from @xmath8 to @xmath9 with @xmath8 indicating @xmath5 to be a pure state and @xmath9 indicating @xmath5 to be completely mixed . in @xcite ,",
    "munro _ et al .",
    "_ explored the concurrence - entropy relations for all physically allowed two - qubit states .",
    "they found the class of states that has the maximum amount of entanglement for a given degree of entropy .",
    "it was shown that as the entropy increases , the maximum achievable amount of entanglement by any possible bipartite qubit state decreases .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that beyond a critical value of @xmath10 , no two - qubit state could possibly be entangled .",
    "the class of states that have the maximum amount of entanglement for a given degree of entropy is referred to as _ maximally entangled mixed states _ ( mems ) @xcite . for the two - qubit case",
    ", the mems class happens to be of the @xmath1 form .",
    "this fact suggests that even for an @xmath0-qubit system , they may be of the @xmath1 form .    here , restricting our analysis to the class of @xmath1-states , we will generalize the two - qubit results to a general @xmath0-qubit setup .",
    "in particular , we find the class of @xmath1 density matrices that , for a given amount of entropy , has the maximum amount of genuine @xmath0-qubit entanglement ( see eq .",
    "( [ e.memxs ] ) ) .",
    "we find that the critical amount of entropy , as a function of @xmath0 , above which no @xmath1 density matrix can possibly exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement is @xmath11 we see that this critical entropy increases as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this indicates that in the limit of a large number of qubits , it is possible to find highly mixed states that can still possess entanglement .",
    "the dependence of various physical parameters on the entropy of a bipartite system state and the scaling of these dependences on the dimensionality of the two parties involved can be found in @xcite .    in section [ s.x - matrices ] , we briefly explain the concept of genuine multipartite entanglement . in this section",
    ", we also describe the @xmath1 density matrices of @xmath0 qubits and the genuine multipartite concurrence that quantifies the entanglement for these states . in section [ s.memxs ]",
    ", we derive the maximally entangled mixed @xmath1 states ( x - mems ) for @xmath0 qubits .",
    "we conclude in section [ s.conclusion ] .",
    "a system consisting of @xmath0 qubits is said to possess genuine multipartite entanglement if each qubit is entangled with every other qubit and not only to some of them @xcite . to make this statement more explicit , we first define what is meant by a bi - separable state : a pure @xmath0-qubit state , say @xmath12 ,",
    "is said to be bi - separable if it can be written as a product of two multi - qubit states : @xmath13 ( the subscript stands for bi - separable ) .",
    "a mixed state is bi - separable if it can be written as a mixture of bi - separable pure states : @xmath14 . if an @xmath0-qubit state is not bi - separable , it is genuinely @xmath0-partite entangled @xcite .",
    "one of the proposed measures to quantify genuine multi - partite entanglement is genuine multi - partite concurrence @xcite . for a pure state ,",
    "@xmath12 , genuine multi - partite concurrence is defined as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents the set of all possible bi - partitions , @xmath17 , of the @xmath0 parties and @xmath18 is the reduced density matrix : @xmath19 . for a mixed state ,",
    "@xmath5 , the concept of @xmath3 can be formally generalized to @xmath20 where the minimization has to be carried out over all possible pure state decompositions of the density matrix : @xmath21 .",
    "this minimization procedure renders analytic or even numerical parameterization of @xmath3 infeasible in general .    for some cases ,",
    "lower bounds on @xmath3 are available for analysis @xcite . only recently , by generalizing the result for the two - qubit case @xcite , an exact analytic expression for @xmath3 was derived for an @xmath0-qubit system whose density matrix has an @xmath1 form @xcite .",
    "to briefly elaborate on the result in @xcite , let us look at an @xmath0-qubit @xmath1 density matrix . arranging the rows and columns in an orthonormal product basis ,",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , the @xmath1 density matrices have the general structure of the following form : @xmath26 where @xmath27 . for the @xmath1 matrix to be a valid density matrix , one must have @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "these conditions are necessary and sufficient for the @xmath1 matrix to have unit trace and positive eigenvalues . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the @xmath3 for the above @xmath0-qubit state is given by @xmath30 note that for the two - qubit case , this result reduces to the previously known result derived by wootters @xcite .",
    "if any one of the qubit s state is traced out from the @xmath1-matrix , the rest of the qubits become separable .",
    "this fact can be understood by noticing that if one traces any of the qubits from eq .",
    "( [ e.x ] ) , one gets a diagonal and hence separable reduced density matrix .",
    "an example of @xmath1-states is the class of well known ghz states .",
    "the ghz states have theoretical and practical importance . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that there are no bounds to the amount by which the ghz states can violate the limits imposed by a bell s inequality . in the context of trapped ions , it has been possible to experimentally create ghz states of up to fourteen qubits @xcite . with the advances in experimental circuit qed , it is predicted that large number of qubits can be initialized in the ghz states @xcite . for two - qubit systems ,",
    "the @xmath1-states are central to understanding the relations between fully entangled fractions and entanglement @xcite .",
    "several important remarks may be made about the experimentally common action of uncontrolled environmental influences on the system .",
    "the possibility that an arbitrary initial pure state de - cohering into an @xmath1-state was studied in @xcite .",
    "further we can rely on the fact that the @xmath1-state form itself is robust in the sense that states initially in the @xmath1 form remain in the @xmath1 form if local damping channels act on the various non - interacting qubits @xcite .",
    "another key point is that decoherence processes that add additional non-@xmath1 elements can not decrease the degree of entanglement .",
    "that is , the @xmath1 part alone of a general density matrix provides a lower bound of genuine multipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath1-states are an important and experimentally viable class of physically allowed @xmath0-qubit states .",
    "in this section , we explore the entropy verses genuine multipartite entanglement properties of @xmath0-qubit @xmath1-states . for concreteness ,",
    "we begin by considering a three - qubit system ( the two - qubit system was studied in @xcite ) .",
    "we randomly generate a million @xmath1-density matrices of three qubits and determine their linear entropy and genuine multi - partite concurrence using eqs .",
    "( [ e.s ] ) and ( [ e.c_gm ] ) respectively .",
    "the entanglement - entropy plane for the three - qubit @xmath1-states is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3qubit ] where we have plotted @xmath3 and @xmath31 for each of the randomly generated @xmath1 matrices .",
    "each of the million points corresponds to the @xmath32 and @xmath33 calculated for a randomly generated @xmath1-density matrix .",
    "we are interested in the class of states that lies at the boundary .",
    "we also want to know what the critical entropy , @xmath34 , is as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "critical entropy is the entropy above which no possible system state in the @xmath1 form possesses genuine multipartite entanglement.,width=302,height=151 ]    we notice two qualitative trends from fig .",
    "[ fig.3qubit ] .",
    "first is that as the entropy increases , the maximum amount of achievable genuine multi - partite entanglement decreases .",
    "the second important thing to notice is that beyond a critical amount of entropy ( close to 0.9 in this case ) , no state possesses genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "these qualitative features can be quantitatively captured by knowing the class of states that lies at the boundary of the entanglement - entropy plane .",
    "these are the states that have the maximum entropy for a given amount of entanglement or said in a different way , has the maximum amount of entanglement for a given amount of entropy",
    ". we will refer to this class of states as _ maximally entangled mixed @xmath1-states _ ( x - mems ) .",
    "the purpose of this report is to find x - mems for an @xmath0-qubit system .    without loss of generality",
    ", we assume that for a genuinely multi - partite entangled state the concurrence is given by , @xmath35 .",
    "we now prove that for every density matrix of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ e.x ] ) , we can find another density matrix , @xmath36 , that has the same @xmath3 as the density matrix @xmath1 but has a higher entropy .",
    "the density matrix elements of @xmath36 in terms of the matrix elements of @xmath1 are as follows : @xmath37 the @xmath38 s are added to the @xmath39 s to ensure that the trace of @xmath36 is one .",
    "it is clear that the genuine multi - partite entanglement of @xmath1 and @xmath36 is the same : @xmath40 in order to prove that the entropy of @xmath36 is more than the entropy of @xmath1 , we note that for @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 the facts that @xmath43 and @xmath44 imply that the maximally entangled mixed @xmath1 states have to be of the @xmath36 form for which all the lower diagonal elements except @xmath45 are zero .    to reduce mathematical complications while deriving the form of x - mems , we redefine the following matrix elements of @xmath36 which were previously defined in eq .",
    "( [ e.matel_barx ] ) : @xmath46 to ensure the positivity and unit trace properties of the density matrix @xmath36 , the following conditions must be satisfied : @xmath47 with this redefinition , the density matrix , @xmath36 , takes the following form : @xmath48 for the above form of the density matrix , the genuine multipartite concurrence is simply given by @xmath49 .",
    "keeping @xmath50 fixed , we now need to figure out the expressions for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 that would maximize the entropy , @xmath54 . to this end",
    ", we note that because of the presence of the off - diagonal element @xmath55 , the diagonal matrix elements @xmath52 and @xmath53 have to be treated separately than all other diagonal entries , @xmath51 for @xmath56 .",
    "we also note that keeping the off - diagonal element constant , entropy or mixedness is maximized if all the possible diagonal elements are equally populated , i.e. when @xmath57 where we have defined two new variables , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . using the constraint that the sum of the diagonal terms should sum to one",
    ", the variable @xmath59 can be eliminated from the expression of the linear entropy of the density matrix @xmath36 to get : @xmath60 where @xmath61 we now need to maximize the linear entropy , @xmath54 , for a given amount of @xmath49 .",
    "while doing so , we have to remember the constraints in eq .",
    "( [ e.constraints ] ) . according to eq .",
    "( [ e.constraints ] ) , one must have @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which implies that @xmath64 . keeping these constraints in mind ,",
    "we plot @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ fig.max_s ] as a function of @xmath65 for four different values of @xmath50 .    .",
    "the solid lines correspond to @xmath54 for different values of @xmath50 over the allowed range of @xmath66 . according to eqs .",
    "( [ e.constraints ] ) and ( [ e.ax ] ) , the allowed range of @xmath66 is @xmath67 .",
    "the solid dots correspond to the respective maximas of the various curves .",
    "we see that the maximum of @xmath54 occurs at @xmath68 if @xmath69 and at @xmath70 if @xmath71.,width=302,height=151 ]    we note that when @xmath72 the maximum of @xmath54 occurs at @xmath68 , which according to the trace condition means that @xmath73 . on the other hand , when @xmath74 , the maximum of @xmath54 occurs at @xmath70 , which in turn implies that @xmath75 . with these considerations ,",
    "we finally get the following form of the @xmath1-density matrices that has the maximum amount of entropy for a given amount of genuine multipartite entanglement : @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 as noted earlier , these are also the states that have the maximum amount of entanglement for a given amount of entropy .",
