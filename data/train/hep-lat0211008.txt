    "in a recent series of papers @xcite , we have used a new staggered fermion action modified to include an irrelevant 4-fermion interaction which preserves the flavour symmetries of the standard staggered action , to study the chiral symmetry restoring finite temperature phase transition of qcd .",
    "( for earlier work by others proposing similar actions see @xcite . ) in particular , we study the transition with two massless quark flavours . such simulations are impossible with the standard action , since the dirac operator becomes singular at zero quark mass . on lattices with temporal extent @xmath2 , the transition appeared to be first order @xcite , while at @xmath3 it appeared to be second order as expected @xcite , but with the critical indices of a tricritical point @xcite , rather than the @xmath4 indices expected from universality arguments .",
    "we interpreted these results to indicate that at these large lattice spacings @xmath5 , the additional interactions due to discretization , which vanish as @xmath6 , are large enough to affect the nature of the transition .",
    "for this reason , we are currently performing simulations at @xmath7 .",
    "one such interaction is our additional 4-fermion interaction , so we need to vary its coefficient in an attempt to determine how important it is in determining the nature of the phase transition . at @xmath3",
    "we ran at 2 different ( small ) values of this coupling and concluded that although the @xmath8 of the transition changed as this coupling was varied , its nature did not . in this paper",
    "we present the results of studies of the dependence of the @xmath2 transition on the 4-fermion coupling .",
    "the action we use is the staggered lattice version of the continuum euclidean lagrangian density , @xmath9 .",
    "\\label{eqn : lagrangian}\\ ] ] for details of the staggered lattice transcription of this lagrangian , using auxiliary fields to render it quadratic in the fermion fields , thus allowing simulations , we refer the reader to our earlier papers .",
    "the largest value of @xmath10 used in our previous simulations at @xmath2 , and the only value for which we determined the nature of the transition , was @xmath11 .",
    "we present the results of new simulations at @xmath12 on @xmath0 and @xmath1 lattices , which indicate that the transition remains first order .",
    "we have also extended the studies of the @xmath13 transition reported in our earlier work .",
    "these new studies show no sign of the meta - stability observed at @xmath14 , suggesting that the @xmath13 transition is second order .    in section  2 we present the results of these simulations .",
    "section  3 gives our conclusions .",
    "we performed simulations using the hybrid molecular dynamics method with noisy fermions allowing us to tune to 2 flavours .",
    "we ran on @xmath0 and @xmath1 lattices to observe finite size effects . on both lattices",
    "our molecular dynamics time increment was chosen to be @xmath17 , which appeared adequate .",
    "our quark mass was set to zero and @xmath12 .    for the @xmath0 simulations we ran for @xmath18 molecular dynamics time units for @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 values in the range @xmath22 , and @xmath23 time units for 3 @xmath21s outside this range .",
    "we observed evidence for metastability with 2-state signals both in the chiral condensate and in the wilson line ( polyakov loop ) for @xmath24 , with the clearest signals at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "a histogram of the chiral condensate at @xmath25 is shown in figure  [ fig : hist8 ] , showing two clearly separated peaks . from this",
    "we would conclude that there is a first order transition .",
    "we estimate the transition to occur at @xmath27 .    for our @xmath1 simulations",
    ", we ran for @xmath28 time units at @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath25 , close to the transition , and for shorter ` times ' at 8 other @xmath21 values in the range @xmath31 .",
    "we observed clear signals for metastability with a well defined 2-state signal at @xmath30 and @xmath25 , but not outside this region , clear evidence that there is a first order transition at @xmath32 .",
    "the time evolution of the chiral condensate at @xmath30 is shown in figure  [ fig : time ] .",
    "a histogram showing the two - state signal in the chiral condensate at @xmath30 is shown in figure  [ fig : hist12 ] .",
    "the separation of the peaks in this histogram is @xmath33 , while that on the @xmath25 histogram on the @xmath0 lattice is @xmath34 .",
    "the decrease in going to the larger lattice is small , leading us to the conclusion that the first order transition is real , and not a small lattice artifact .",
    "for the wilson line , the peak separation is @xmath35 for the larger lattice and @xmath36 for the smaller lattice .",
    "most of this change comes from a rise in the value of the wilson line for the low temperature phase , and might well be a fermion screening effect on the larger lattice .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : wil - psi ] shows the two order parameters for the @xmath1 lattice simulations as functions of @xmath21 , showing how abrupt the transition is .",
    "since our earlier studies at stronger 4-fermion couplings were inadequate to determine the nature of the phase transition , we have extended the @xmath13 simulations to @xmath1 lattices and added some @xmath21 values in the crossover region to our @xmath0 simulations . for the larger lattice we ran for @xmath28 time units for each @xmath21 in the range @xmath37 .",
    "figure  [ fig : wil - psi5 ] shows the chiral condensate and wilson line for the @xmath1 lattice .",
    "the transition appears smooth , and the time dependence of these order parameters shows no sign of metastability for any of these @xmath21 values .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath13 chiral transition is second order and occurs at @xmath38",
    "we have simulated lattice qcd with 2 flavours of massless staggered quarks and an additional chiral 4-fermion term on @xmath2 lattices .",
    "the chiral finite temperature transition at weaker 4-fermion coupling ( @xmath12 ) appears to be first order , as it was at stronger 4-fermion coupling ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the chiral condensate in the confined phase at the transition was @xmath39 at @xmath12 , compared with @xmath40 for @xmath11 ( in the deconfined phase this condensate would vanish ) .",
    "the change in the wilson line across the transition is @xmath41 for @xmath12 , compared with @xmath42 at @xmath11 .",
    "a priori , this softening of the transition as the 4-fermion coupling weakens might suggest that it would become second order at vanishing 4-fermion coupling .",
    "however , we see that at stronger coupling , @xmath13 , the transition is even softer and probably second order , so the situation is not so simple .",
    "we suggest that the order of the transition is determined primarily by the ` standard ' ( @xmath43 independent ) part of the action , and hence by @xmath21 . on @xmath2 lattices , @xmath32 at @xmath12 compared with @xmath44 at @xmath11 and @xmath45 at @xmath13 . at @xmath14",
    "the lower values of @xmath46 mean larger lattice artifacts , which we suggest make the transition first order .",
    "the larger @xmath46 at @xmath13 , has smaller lattice artifacts , which we suggest leave it second order .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath46 at @xmath13 and @xmath2 is very close to @xmath46 at @xmath12 for @xmath3 , which we have determined to be second order ( tricritical ) , which is consistent with this scenario .",
    "the reason the discontinuity in the @xmath11 chiral condensate is greater than that at @xmath12 is that the stronger 4-fermion coupling enhances condensate formation .",
    "the larger @xmath21 of the @xmath11 transition increases the wilson line just above the transition over the corresponding @xmath12 value .",
    "such a scenario suggests that at zero 4-fermion coupling @xmath47 , the transition would remain first order .",
    "as was noted in reference  @xcite , the presence of this first order transition could explain the failure of universal critical scaling at the @xmath2 finite temperature transition for lattice qcd with 2 staggered fermion flavours as @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "finally , we should comment that , because this 4-fermion term also breaks the same flavour symmetries as the standard staggered action , it has the potential to significantly increase this breaking and make improving this action more difficult .",
    "we are planning hadron spectroscopy calculations to determine how bad this breaking might be .",
    "however , this additional @xmath49 symmetry breaking could be reduced to @xmath50 by addition of the terms required to make this 4-fermion interaction that of the staggered lattice implementation of the @xmath51 or @xmath52 gross - neveu model @xcite .",
    "the only problem is that such an action has a complex fermion determinant , essential to the physics of interest .",
    "however , changing some of the couplings from imaginary to real removes this difficulty , and it might be possible to analytically continue results from real values to imaginary values of these couplings , as has been suggested for similar terms in the highly improved staggered actions proposed by the hpqcd collaboration @xcite .",
    "we note that the 4-fermion term in our action , and at least some of the additional 4-fermion terms which we are suggesting , are present in the hpqcd action after a fierz transformation .",
