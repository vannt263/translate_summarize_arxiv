    "point configurations and convex polytopes play central roles in computational geometry and discrete geometry . for many problems , their _ combinatorial structures _ or _ types _",
    "is often more important than their metric structures .",
    "the combinatorial type of a point configuration is defined by all possible partitions of the points by a hyperplane ( the definition given in ( [ def : covectors ] ) ) , and encodes various important information such as the convexity , the face lattice of the convex hull and all possible triangulations .",
    "one of the most significant merits to consider combinatorial types of them is that they are finite for any _ fixed sizes _ ( dimension and number of elements ) while there are infinitely many realizations of a fixed combinatorial type .",
    "this enables us to enumerate those objects and study them through computational experiments .",
    "for example ,",
    "finschi and fukuda  @xcite constructed a counterexample for the conjecture by da silva and fukuda  @xcite using their database  @xcite .",
    "aichholzer , aurenhammer and krasser  @xcite and aichholzer and krasser  @xcite developed a database of point configurations  @xcite and showed usefulness of the database by presenting various applications to computational geometry  @xcite .    despite its merits , enumerating combinatorial types of point configurations is known to be a quite hard task .",
    "actually , the recognition problem of combinatorial types of point configurations is polynomially equivalent to the _ existential theory of the reals ( etr ) _ , the problem to decide whether a given polynomial equalities and inequalities system with integer coefficients has a real solution or not , even for @xmath0-dimensional point configurations  @xcite . because of this difficulty",
    ", enumerations have been done in the following two steps .",
    "the first step is to enumerate a suitable super set of combinatorial types of point configurations which can be recognized efficiently .",
    "one of the most frequently used structures has been _ oriented matroids_. oriented matroids are characterized by simple axiom systems and many techniques for the enumeration have been proposed . exploiting a canonical representation of oriented matroids and algorithmic advances , finschi and fukuda  @xcite enumerated",
    "oriented matroids including _ non - uniform _ ones ( definition [ def : uniform ] ) , degenerate configurations in the abstract setting , on up to @xmath5 elements of rank @xmath1 and those on up to @xmath2 elements for every rank .",
    "in addition , finschi , fukuda and moriyama enumerated _ uniform _ oriented matroids ( definition [ def : uniform ] ) in om(@xmath6 ) and om(@xmath7 ) using omlib  @xcite , where om(@xmath8 ) denotes the set of all rank @xmath9 oriented matroids on @xmath10 elements .",
    "aichholzer , aurenhammer and krasser  @xcite , and aichholzer and krasser  @xcite enumerated uniform oriented matroids on up to @xmath11 elements of rank @xmath1 .",
    "the enumeration results are summarized in table [ existing1 ] .    in the second step , to obtain all possible combinatorial types of point configurations , we need to extract oriented matroids that are _ acyclic _ and _ realizable_. realizable oriented matroids ( definition [ def : realizable ] ) are oriented matroids that can be represented as vector configurations and acyclic - ness ( definition [ def : acyclic ] ) abstracts the condition that a vector configuration can be associated to a point configuration .",
    "while checking the acyclic - ness is trivial , the realizability problem is polynomially equivalent to etr  @xcite and thus np - hard . in this paper , we show that the realizability problem can be practically solved for small size instances by exploiting sufficient conditions of realizability or those of non - realizability .",
    "the enumeration of realizable oriented matroids has a long history .",
    "first , grnbaum  @xcite enumerated all realizable rank @xmath1 oriented matroids on up to @xmath12 elements through the enumeration of hyperplane arrangements . then canham  @xcite and halsey  @xcite performed enumeration of all realizable rank @xmath1 oriented matroids on @xmath13 elements .",
    "goodman and pollack  @xcite proved that rank @xmath1 oriented matroids on up to @xmath2 elements are all realizable .",
    "the enumeration of rank @xmath1 uniform realizable oriented matroids on @xmath3 elements is due to richter  @xcite and gonzalez - sprinberg and laffaille  @xcite .",
    "the case of rank @xmath14 uniform oriented matroids on @xmath2 elements was resolved by bokowski and richter - gebert  @xcite .",
    "bokowski , laffille and richter resolved the case of rank @xmath1 uniform oriented matroids on @xmath5 elements ( unpublished ) .",
    "recently , aichholzer , aurenhammer and krasser  @xcite developed a database of all realizable non - degenerate acyclic oriented matroids of rank @xmath1 on @xmath5 elements and then aichholzer and krasser  @xcite uniform ones of rank @xmath1 on @xmath11 elements .",
    "the enumeration results are summarized in table [ existing1_realizable ] .",
    "the enumeration of combinatorial types of convex polytopes also has a long history .",
    "the combinatorial types of convex polytopes are defined by _ face lattices _ ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "all combinatorial types of @xmath1-polytopes can be enumerated by using steinitz theorem  @xcite .",
    "we can also obtain all combinatorial types of @xmath15-polytopes with @xmath10 vertices using gale diagrams for @xmath16  @xcite . on the other hand , the enumeration of combinatorial types of @xmath15-polytopes with @xmath17 vertices and those of @xmath14-polytopes are known to be quite difficult  @xcite .",
    "grnbaum and sreedharan  @xcite listed all combinatorial types of simplical @xmath14-polytopes with @xmath2 vertices , and altshuler , bokowski and steinberg  @xcite those of simplicial @xmath14-polytopes with @xmath3 vertices , and then altshuler and steinberg  @xcite those of non - simplicial @xmath14-polytopes with @xmath2 vertices .",
    "the enumeration results are summarized in table [ existing2 ] .    however , there is no database of these objects including degenerate ones or of high dimensions , currently .",
    "many problems in combinatorial geometry remain open especially for high dimensional cases or degenerate cases , and thus a database of combinatorial types for higher dimensional or degenerate ones will be of great importance . for example , characterizing the @xmath18-vectors of @xmath15-polytopes is a big open problem for @xmath19 while the same questions for 3-polytopes and for simplicial polytopes have already been solved  @xcite .",
    "since finschi and fukuda developed a database of oriented matroids  @xcite containing non - uniform ones , the realizability classification of larger oriented matroids including non - uniform case has begun .",

    "there are several methods to solve general polynomial inequalities such as cylindrical algebraic decomposition  @xcite , but the problem size which can be practically dealt with is quite limited , and our instances turn out to be intractable .",
    "one of the reasons is that those methods compute the complete description of cylindrical decomposition of the solution set , which is not necessary for our purpose .",
    "it suffices to find one solution of the polynomial system to decide realizability , which is usually a much easier task .",

    "we extend the elimination rule and introduce some additional techniques so that they can be applied to a broader class of oriented matroids .",
    "we also use random realizations when there are remaining variables in the final step . using this method",
