    "the @xmath3 process is a rare decay , which has been recently studied by several authors in context of standard chiral perturbation theory ( s@xmath4pt ) , namely at the lowest order by knchlein , scherer and drechsel @xcite and to next - to - leading by bellucci and isidori @xcite and ametller et al.@xcite .",
    "the experimental interest for such a process comes from the anticipation of large number of @xmath0 s to be produced at various facilities.ne about @xmath5 decays per year ] the goal of our computations is to add the result for the next - to - leading order in generalized chiral perturbation theory ( g@xmath4pt ) .",
    "the motivation is that one of the important contributions involve the @xmath6 off - shell vertex which is very sensitive to the violation of the standard scheme and thus this decay provides a possibility of its eventual observation .",
    "we have completed the calculations at the tree level , added 1pi one loop corrections and phenomenological corrections of the resonant contribution .",
    "these preliminary results we would like to present in this paper .",
    "the amplitude of the process can be defined @xmath7 in the square of the amplitude summed over the polarizations @xmath8 only three independent lorentz invariant variables occur @xmath9 where @xmath10 resp .",
    "@xmath11 can be interpreted as diphoton resp .",
    "dipion energy squares .",
    "@xmath12 can be expressed in terms of @xmath13 and the angle @xmath14 between the direction of the diphoton and one of the photons in the center of mass of the diphoton .",
    "the range of the kinematic variables is    @xmath15    our goal is to calculate the partial decay width of the @xmath0 particle as the function of the diphoton energy square @xmath10 @xmath16 at the lowest order , the s@xmath4pt does not depend on any unknown free order parameters .",
    "in contrast , there are two free parameters controlling the violation of the standard picture in the generalized scheme .",
    "we have chosen them as @xmath17 and their ranges are @xmath18 .",
    "the standard values of these parameters are @xmath19 and @xmath20 . in the standard counting also @xmath21 , where @xmath22 we use abbreviations for @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "at the @xmath25 tree level , the amplitude has two contributions , with a pion and an eta propagator .",
    "the first one is resonant and thus we call it ` @xmath26-pole ' , the other is nonresonant ` @xmath0-tail '",

    "the pole of the resonant contribution at @xmath39 is transparent . while in the standard case it is fully dominant , in the generalized scheme the @xmath0-tail could be determining in the whole area @xmath40 .",
    "the reason can be found in the constant @xmath36 from the @xmath6 vertex .",
    "its standard value is equal to @xmath41 , but in the generalized counting it could jump up to @xmath42 .",
    "compared to @xmath36 , @xmath43 is not so sensitive , maximum value is @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the full decay width for the standard ( @xmath46 ) and generalized case ( @xmath19,@xmath47 and @xmath48,@xmath49 ) is displayed in fig.[graph6 ] .",
    "it can be seen , that even in the conservative intermediate case the change is quite interesting .",
    "there are four distinct contributions at the next - to - leading order : one loop corrections to the @xmath50-pole and the @xmath0-tail , one particle irreducible diagrams and counterterms . in the latter case we will rely upon the results of @xcite .",
    "their estimate from vector meson dominated counterterms indicates , that it causes only a slight decrease of the full decay width .",
    "because the estimate is the same for both schemes , for our purpose of studying the differences between them we can leave it for later investigation .",
    "more important might be the corrections to the @xmath0-tail diagram . at the present time , although we do have the amplitude , we are still working at the numerical analysis .",
    "we decided , similarly to @xcite , to correct the @xmath26-pole amplitude ( [ treepion ] ) by a phenomenological parametrization of the @xmath51 vertex and fix the parameters from experimental @xmath51 data : @xmath52 the factor @xmath53 can be fixed from the experimental results for @xmath51 @xcite @xmath54 as the phase @xmath55 cancels in the square of the amplitude , it can not be determined that way .",
