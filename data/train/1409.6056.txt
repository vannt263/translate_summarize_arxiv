    "the deuteron is the simplest nuclear system with the wave function strongly dominated by @xmath1 component .",
    "thus , it can be used for studies of many aspects of @xmath1 strong interaction .",
    "one of such aspects is the studies of the @xmath1 system at short distances where one hopes to gain access to many fundamental issues of nuclear dynamics , such as relativistic description of nuclear structure , the dynamics of the @xmath2 repulsive core , role of the non - nucleonic degrees of freedom , and hadron - quark transition at very short distances .",
    "however one problem in realizing such a program of studies is that the deuteron is barley bound with the charge - rms radius of about @xmath3 .",
    "this fact in the momentum space is reflected in the very steep momentum distribution of the unpolarized deuteron wave function with the strength concentrated predominantly at the small relative momenta in the @xmath1 system , ( see the curve labelled as @xmath4 in fig.1 ) .",
    "however the fact that the deuteron has a @xmath5-wave which vanishes at small momenta indicates that isolating it in any given reaction with the deuteron will allow effectively suppress the small - momentum / long - range contributions .",
    "this can be seen from the polarized density matrix of the deuteron@xcite : @xmath6{u(k_1)w(k_2 ) \\over \\sqrt{2 } } + \\left[1 - { 3|k_1\\cdot a|^2 \\over k_1 ^ 2 } \\right]{u(k_2)w(k_1 ) \\over \\sqrt{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left ( { 9\\over 2 } { ( k_1 \\cdot a)(k_2\\cdot a)^*(k_1\\cdot k_2 )   \\over k_1 ^ 2k_2 ^ 2 } - { 3\\over2}{|k_1\\cdot",

    "the polarization vector @xmath10 is defined through the deuteron spin wave functions : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the projection of the deuteron s spin in the @xmath13 direction .",
    "the unpolarized density matrix of the deuteron is defined as : @xmath14 .    since @xmath15",
    ", it follows from eq.([rho_a ] ) that any polarization combination of @xmath16 , in which @xmath17 term is canceled has an enhanced sensitivity to the larger internal momenta ( smaller distances ) of the deuteron as compared to the unpolarized case .",
    "it follows from eq.([rho_a ] ) , that the @xmath18 term does not depend on the polarization vector @xmath10 , thus one can cancel this term summing any two polarization components of the density matrix and subtracting the doubled value of the third polarization component .",

    "this suggests the ways for studying several issues of nuclear physics related to the short - range interactions using tensor polarized deuteron targets .    *",
    "the @xmath5-wave component of the deuteron : * the presence of the @xmath5-wave component in the deuteron follows from the existence of the finite quadruple momentum of the deuteron .",
    "it is directly related to the tensor part of the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "the modern @xmath2 interaction potentials which fit the existing @xmath2 phase - shifts with @xmath27 predict the overall probability of the @xmath5 wave in the deuteron to be in the range of @xmath28 ( cdbonn@xcite ) to @xmath29 ( av18@xcite ) .",
    "although the difference seems rather small , these parameterizations predict substantially different high momentum strengths above @xmath30  mev / c , which is predominantly related to the @xmath5 component .",
    "the need to understand the d - wave momentum distribution became more pressing recently , due to the observation of the strong dominance of @xmath1 short range correlations ( srcs ) in nuclei as compared to the @xmath31 and @xmath32 srcs@xcite , which is related to the tensor component of nn interaction in the src@xcite .",
    "the dominance of the tensor interaction in the high momentum component of the nuclear wave function may play important role in the dynamics of the asymmetric nuclei@xcite with nontrivial implications for superdense nuclear matter and neutron stars@xcite .    very recently",
    "another interesting aspect of the role of the @xmath5-wave was revealed in the observation of @xmath33 scaling of the momentum distributions in the deuteron and nuclei@xcite in the momentum range of 300 - 600  mev / c , which show intriguing similarities with the contact observed in the two - component symmetric atomic systems of fermions .    as it follows from eq.([rho_t20 ] ) the processes involving tensor - polarized deuteron target are directly related to the structure of the @xmath5-partial wave component in the deuteron .    *",
    "relativistic dynamics of the nn bound system : * one of the important issues in studying of nuclear structure at short distances is the need for a relativistic description of the bound system .",
    "this is an important issue also in understanding the qcd medium effects with recent studies indicating that parton distribution modifications in nuclei are proportional to the high momentum component of nuclear wave function@xcite .",
    "the deuteron is the simplest bound system and naturally any self - consistent attempt to understand the relativistic effects in the bound nuclear systems should start with the deuteron .",
    "the issue of the relativistic description of the deuteron has long history with extensive research started already in late 1970 s ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the experimental studies of the relativistic effects in the unpolarized deuteron up to now included the large @xmath0 elastic @xmath34 scatterings@xcite .",
    "however due to complexities in the reaction mechanism the relativistic effects were difficult to isolate .    the processes involving tensor polarized deuteron target are expected to exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the relativistic effects due to higher average momentum of the bound nucleon entering in the polarized nuclear density matrix as compared to the unpolarized case .",
    "thus one can discuss possible high momentum transfer reactions off tensor polarized deuteron and study their sensitivity to the relativistic effects of the bound nucleon motion .",
    "* final sate hadronic interactions : * the fact that tensor polarized deuteron is characterized by a larger average internal momenta indicates that the two nucleons are in close proximity and scattering from such target can yield large final state hadronic interactions in exclusive reactions .",
    "the latter can be used in studies of the hadronic properties of produced particles such as nucleons@xcite or vector mesons@xcite .",

    "we will discuss several electroproduction reactions in which utilizing the unique features of the tensor polarized deuteron would allow to study the above discussed properties of high energy processes .    *",
    "high @xmath0 near - threshold inclusive scattering : * high @xmath0 ( @xmath36  gev@xmath37 ) inclusive scattering at @xmath38 is known to probe large longitudinal momenta of bound nucleon interacting with the virtual photon .",
    "one of the important indications that these reactions indeed probe the high momentum component of the nuclear wave function is the observation of the scaling in the ratios of the @xmath39 cross sections to that of deuteron@xcite or light nuclei@xcite .",
    "using the tensor polarized deuteron in such reactions allows to prepare the nucleus in the most compact state in which due to the absence of the pure ( s - wave)@xmath37 contribution ( fig.[fig1 ] ) the system in average is sensitive to a higher momentum of the nucleon in the deuteron for given @xmath40 and @xmath0 . at large @xmath41  gev@xmath37 kinematics",
    "the probed longitudinal momenta of the bound nucleon is @xmath42 , or the light cone momentum fraction @xmath43 . because of these kinematic conditions and the absence of the ( s - wave)@xmath37 contribution one expects a measurable relativistic effects already at @xmath44 .",
    "such an early onset of the relativistic effects indicates that one should be able to separate them from the uncertainty related to the choice of the nn potential .",
    "the sensitivity to the relativistic effects is estimated using the theoretical calculations based on two very different approaches .",
    "the first approach describes the bound nucleon in the deuteron rest frame treating the interacting nucleon as being virtual ( virtual nucleon approximation ( vna ) ) by taking the residue over the positive energy pole of the spectator nucleon . in this case",
    "the deuteron wave function satisfies the covariant equation of two - nucleon bound system with spectator being on mass - shell ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another approach is based on the observation that high energy processes evolve along the light - cone .",
    "therefore , it is natural to describe the reaction within the light - cone non - covariant framework @xcite .",
    "negative energy states do not enter in this case , though one has to take into account so called instantaneous interactions . in the approximation",
    "when non - nucleonic degrees of freedom in the deuteron wave function can be neglected , one can relate the light - cone wave functions to those calculated in the lab frame by introducing the lc @xmath1 relative three momentum @xmath45 .    in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "the predictions for vna@xcite and lc@xcite approximations are given for the tensor asymmetry , @xmath46 , at the highest @xmath0 kinematics for the proposed recently experiment at jefferson lab@xcite .",
    "as the figure shows for @xmath47 the uncertainty due to the nn potentials used in the calculations is much smaller than the relativistic effects , while at high @xmath48 we have substantial uncertainty due to the potentials .",
    "the calculations predict large @xmath35 asymmetry in @xmath49 region with significant potential of discrimination between both relativistic and nn potential effects .",
    "* high momentum transfer exclusive electrodisintegration of the deuteron : * the possibility of the extension of inclusive measurements to the exclusive electrodisintegration reactions in which struck nucleon carries almost all the momentum of the virtual nucleon gives direct access to the dynamics of the bound nucleon .",
    "recently the first high @xmath0 experiments were completed for @xmath50 reactions@xcite , in which it was observed that due to the onset of the eikonal regime in the final state interaction ( fsi ) of the stuck proton with the spectator neutron it is possible to isolate kinematic regions with minimal and maximal fsi effects .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the theoretical calculations which are based on high energy approximations in the description of fsi effects ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the pattern of fsi in @xmath51 reaction is best seen by considering the ratio of the cross section of the full calculation to that of the plane wave impulse approximation : @xmath52 .     and the momentum , @xmath53 of the recoil nucleon . the angle is defined relative to @xmath54.,width=377,height=264 ]    fig.[fig3 ] presents the expectations for @xmath55 as a function of the recoil nucleon angle @xmath56 relative to @xmath57 for different values of recoil nucleon momentum .",
    "the figure demonstrates the distinctive angular dependence of the ratio @xmath55 . at recoil nucleon momenta @xmath58 , @xmath59 and has a minimum , while at @xmath60 , @xmath61 and has a distinctive maximum .",
    "it can be seen from this picture that the fsi is small at kinematics in which recoil momenta in the reaction is parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath62 ( referred to as collinear kinematics ) .",
    "the fsi dominates in the kinematics where @xmath63 , more precisely the maximal re - scattering corresponds to the kinematics in which @xmath64 ( referred to as transverse kinematics ) .",
    "the analysis of fig.[fig3 ] shows that one indeed can isolate the kinematic domains where pwia term is dominant from the domain in which fsi plays a major role .",
    "the ability to identify these two kinematics is an important advantage of high @xmath0 @xmath51 reactions .",
    "it allows to concentrate on the different aspects of the dynamics of @xmath65 reaction with less background effects .",
    "namely the collinear kinematics are best suited for studies of bound nucleon dynamics while in transverse kinematics one can concentrate on the physics of hadronic re - interaction .",
    "dependence of the @xmath50 tensor polarization asymmetry at @xmath66 .",
    "solid and dashed lines are pwia predictions of the lc and vna approximations .",
    "the marked curves present the same ( lc , vna ) calculations including the fsi effects.,width=377,height=264 ]    to quantify these statements in fig.[fig4 ] we present the calculation of @xmath67 ( which is similar to @xmath35 but for exclusive processes ) in collinear kinematics ( @xmath68 ) within virtual nucleon and light - cone approximations described above .",
    "these estimates , similar to the inclusive scattering case , show significant relativistic effects already at moderate momenta of @xmath69mev / c for spectator nucleon .",
    "it is interesting that the fsi effects further increase the difference between vna and lc predictions , making it even easier to discriminate between vna and lc approximations .",
    "* dynamics of the final state interactions : * as it follows from fig.3 , studying the @xmath51 reactions at transverse kinematics allows us to enhance the effects due final state interaction of struck nucleon off the spectator nucleon .",
    "one expects that fsi effects will be further enhanced for tensor - polarized deuteron since it corresponds , in average , to a smaller configuration than in the case of the unpolarized target .",
    "if one assumes that fsi is determined by diffractive small angle @xmath1 rescatterings one can estimate the effect of the fsi on @xmath70 , which is presented in fig.[fig5 ] .     on the angle and momentum of the spectator neutron in @xmath51 reaction .",
    "( a ) pwia approximation ( b ) full calculation that includes fsi.,width=377,height=226 ]    the comparison of fig.[fig5](a ) and ( b ) shows the very strong sensitivity of the asymmetry @xmath70 to the final state interaction at the transverse kinematics : the fsi significantly diminishes the asymmetry starting at @xmath71  mev / c and @xmath72 ( or @xmath73 ) .",
    "this indicates that the quantity @xmath70 can be used as a very sensitive observable for studying the fsi dynamics : for example the onset of the color transparency  ( ct ) phenomena ( for details of ct phenomena see ref.@xcite ) at large @xmath0 ( @xmath74  gev@xmath37 ) .",
    "dependence of @xmath70 for @xmath75 .",
    "solid line - full calculation without ct effects , dashed prediction of quantum diffusion model@xcite , dashed - dotted - prediction of three state resonance model model@xcite , dotted -pwia.,width=377,height=264 ]    for numerical estimates , we consider the @xmath0 dependence of the asymmetry @xmath70 for fixed and transverse momenta of the spectator neutron .",
    "this dependence for @xmath76 mev / c , is presented in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "one can see from this figure that ct effects can change @xmath70 by as much as factor of two for @xmath77 gev@xmath37 .",
    "it is worth noting that the same models predict only 10 - 15% effect for @xmath78 reactions on unpolarized nuclear targets .",
    "the use of the tensor polarized deuteron targets in high energy electro - production reactions would provide a unique possibility for studying the nn strong interaction at short space - time separations .",
    "we demonstrate that such reactions allow a direct test of the relativistic effects in the short range nn interaction .",
    "they also allow to discriminate between different nn potentials .",
    "another advantage of the tensor polarized deuteron as a compact two - nucleon system , is the possibility to enhance significantly the final state hadronic interaction in the exclusive @xmath79 reactions .",
    "this provides a very sensitive tool for studying color transparency phenomena which will be manifested in the suppression of the fsi effects at large @xmath0 kinematics .",
    "all these studies are a part of the broad program dedicated to the investigation of the structure of deeply bound nucleon as well as the physics of color transparency@xcite .",
    "this program could benefit tremendously from the advances of building polarized deuteron targets that can be operated with high current electron beams ."
