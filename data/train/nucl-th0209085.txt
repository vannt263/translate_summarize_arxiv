    "eta photoproduction on the deuteron is of interest with respect to information on the neutron amplitude , the role of @xmath3 interaction ; with respect to the absolute strength of the neutron amplitude , quasi - free production in the incoherent process is favoured ; however , with respect to the relative phase between the elementary amplitudes of proton and neutron , the coherent reaction on the deuteron is better suited because the deuteron acts as an isospin filter and the proton and neutron amplitudes interfere coherently .",
