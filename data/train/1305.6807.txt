    "the interaction of light with conduction electrons in metallic nanoparticles ( nps ) results in localized surface plasmon resonances ( lsprs ) that have the ability to guide , manipulate , and enhance light fields @xcite .",
    "the lsprs are typically confined to length scales much smaller than the diffraction limit , which makes them suitable for localization and enhancement of electromagnetic fields .",
    "these properties enable applications in sensing @xcite , waveguiding @xcite , optical information processing @xcite , or photovoltaics @xcite .",
    "particularly , the near - field enhancement is exploited in near - field microscopy @xcite , photoluminescence @xcite , higher harmonic generation @xcite , and in several enhanced spectroscopies like enhanced fluorescence spectroscopy @xcite , surface enhanced raman spectroscopy ( sers ) @xcite , and surface enhanced infrared spectroscopy ( seirs ) @xcite .",
    "numerical and theoretical methods used to predict and calculate the properties of lsprs are successfully based on the integration of maxwell s equations .",
    "the finite - difference time domain method @xcite , the discrete - dipole approximation @xcite , and the boundary element method @xcite are typical computational methods for full electromagnetic calculations of the optical response in metallic nps .",
    "these complex numerical schemes present , however , little intuitive help about the nature and the physics of the lsprs with respect to parameters like the shape ( geometry ) or complex dielectric functions of nanoparticles . the hybridization model has been proposed as an alternative approach which works very well in the quasi - static limit @xcite .",
    "this model offers an intuitive physical picture in terms of plasmon eigenmodes . on the other hand , in the quasi - static limit ,",
    "the lpsrs are in fact electrostatic resonances of a linear response operator @xcite , which is defined on the boundary of the np resulting a boundary integral equation ( bie ) for an arbitrary geometry .",
    "this linear response operator and its adjoint , the neumann - poincare operator , are associated with the neumann and dirichlet problems in potential theory , respectively @xcite .",
    "in essence , the bie method relates the lsprs to the eigenmodes of the linear response operator and the neumann - poincare operator , such that the spectral studies of the linear response operator provide useful information about the lsprs .",
    "the bie method may work perturbatively even beyond the quasistatic limit @xcite .",
    "moreover , being able to calculate the polarizability of a generic dielectric particle , the method can be applied not only to lsprs in metallic nps , but also for polarizability calculations of biological cells in radiofrequency @xcite . like the hybridization model , the spectral approach to bie offers the same advantages of intuitive view of plasmon eigenmodes .",
    "the method can be extended to clusters of nps @xcite such that symmetry and selection rules that are used in the hybridization model @xcite can be applied directly in bie @xcite by considering the cluster eigenmodes as hybridizations of individual np eigenmodes @xcite .",
    "factors like composition , size , geometry , as well as the embedding media determine the lsprs of metallic np @xcite . in many applications",
    "there is a need for precise locations of the lsprs . in seirs applications , for example",
    ", the spectral localization of the lspr needs to be as close as possible to the molecular vibration that is to be enhanced and therefore sensed .",
    "in addition to that , the near - field enhancement factor is a key figure of merit in the enhanced spectroscopies where the geometry plays an important role .",
    "large near - field enhancement occurs at a sharp tip by the lightning - rod effect @xcite or at the junctions of np dimers @xcite .",
    "the geometrical arrangement in dimers , as opposed to single nps , exhibit much stronger field enhancements ; thus , as the distance between dimer nps decreases , the near - field enhancement increases in the space between the nps of the dimer @xcite .    while the bie method permits the calculation of near - field enhancement @xcite a direct and intuitive way to extract the near - field enhancement factor is still needed . in this work",
    "i present a method that provides explicitly the near - field enhancement and its spatial variation in terms of eigenfunctions of the linear response operator and its adjoint .",
    "the spatial distribution of the field enhancement normal to the surface of the np is proportional to the eigenfunctions of the linear operator .",
    "these eigenfunctions are charge modes , therefore the near - field maxima occur at the maxima of the surface charge density . on the other hand ,",
    "the tangential component of the near - field enhancement is proportional to the derivative of the adjoint operator eigenfunctions , which are , in fact , the surface electric potential generated by the charge modes .",
    "the latter aspect has been hardly used in plasmonic applications .",
    "in addition to that , the current method directly ascertains the relationship between far - field and near - field spectral properties of the lsprs @xcite .",
    "the proposed method has also limitations .",
    "first , it is valid only in the quasistatic approximation , hence the nps must be much smaller than the light wavelength .",
    "the second issue comes from the quantum nature of the lspr phenomenon .",
    "thus the electron spill - out and the nonlocality of the electron interaction determine a different electric field behavior at the surface of the np@xcite .",
    "however , at distances above 1 nm the classical description works well .",
    "it is proved by several examples that , despite these shortcomings , the present method remains a powerful tool for locating and improving the near - field enhancement in plasmonic systems .",
    "the paper has the following structure .",
    "the next section details exhaustively the method of calculating the spatial configuration of the near - field enhancement as depending on the eigenvalues and eigenfuntions of the bie operators .",
    "section iii presents the numerical implementation and two comparative studies : the sphere versus the nearly touching dimer and the nanorod versus the prolate spheroid . in the last section",
    "i summarize the conclusions .",
    "for the sake of clarity i present first the main results of the spectral approach to the bie method .",

    "the hybrid eigenmodes exhibit charge build - up at the junction only in the parallel field polarization .",
    "the proper dimer eigenmodes , on the other hand , show strongly localized behavior at the junction in both polarizations .",
    "thus the large near - field enhancement occurs via the huge charge accumulation and the fast potential change at the dimer junction .",
    "the second example treats the comparative near - field behavior of a nanorod and of a prolate spheroid of the same aspect ratio .",
    "these types of nanoparticles have similar far - field spectra but the near - field enhancement of the spheroid is almost four times higher at the field - oriented extremities of the nanoparticle .",
    "the latter clarifies that , in order to improve the near - field factor , one must bring targeted local corrections to the geometry by focusing on the regions where the absolute value of @xmath119 reaches its maximum .",
    "the current methodology can be easily extended to more complex systems like assemblies of nps .",

    "<S> i present a direct and intuitive eigenmode method that evaluates the near - field enhancement around the surface of metallic nanoparticles of arbitrary shape . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the boundary integral equation in the electrostatic limit . besides the nanoparticle polarizability and the far - field response , </S>",
    "<S> the near - field enhancement around nanoparticles can be also conveniently expressed as an eigenmode sum of resonant terms . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the spatial configuration of the near - field enhancement depends explicitly on the eigenfunctions of both the bie integral operator and of its adjoint . </S>",
    "<S> it is also established a direct physical meaning of the two types of eigenfunctions . while it is well known that the eigenfunctions of the bie operator are electric charge modes , it is less known and used that the eigenfunctions of the adjoint represent the electric potential generated by the charge modes . </S>",
    "<S> for the enhanced spectroscopies the present method allows an easy identification of hot spots which are located in the regions with maximum charge densities and/or regions with fast variations of the electric potential generated by the charge modes on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this study also clarifies the similarities and the differences between the far - field and the near - field behavior of plasmonic systems . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the analysis of concrete examples like the nearly touching dimer , the prolate spheroid , and the nanorod illustrate some modalities to improve the near - field enhancement . </S>"
