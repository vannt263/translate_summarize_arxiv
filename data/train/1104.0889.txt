    "the detection of a charged scalar would be clear evidence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the mssm contains one additional higgs doublet , but supersymmetry places quite severe restrictions on the parameters of the model and their relations , and enforce a higgs sector of a special kind , to be discussed below ( the sizable loop corrections change this picture , however ) . in the nmssm",
    ", the higgs sector contains an additional singlet which allows for a larger variety of parameters .",
    "it is phenomenologically interesting to consider a more minimal addition to the sm , namely adding only one additional higgs doublet to the sm . in this two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , three of the the eight degrees of freedom give masses to the vector bosons , and five physical higgs bosons remain : in a cp - conserving theory these are the cp - even neutral scalars @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the cp - odd @xmath3 , and the charged higgs bosons @xmath4 ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "this is a minimal extension of the higgs sector but it leads to a rich phenomenology and is very useful as a laboratory for higgs physics .",
    "the central exclusive production ( cep ) process @xmath5 , where",
    "@xmath6 stands for a centrally produced system separated from the two very forward protons by large rapidity gaps , has been proposed @xcite as an alternative way of searching for the neutral higgs boson ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the higgs boson is produced in the @xmath7 subprocess through a quark loop .",
    "the two incoming protons survive the collision and lose only a small fraction of their original momentum .",
    "this means that the overall @xmath8-channel exchange must be a color singlet , and this process is therefore very closely related to diffractive processes . if the momenta of the outgoing protons are measured by forward proton detectors placed far away from the interaction point , the mass of the @xmath6 system may be reconstructed  @xcite with a resolution of about 2 gev per event  @xcite .",
    "this is the proposal of the fp420 project  @xcite which aims at placing detectors at 220  m and at 420  m away from atlas or cms .",
    "the perturbative qcd description of the cep process began in @xcite , and the calculation that is now commonly used was initiated by khoze , martin , and ryskin and collaborators in @xcite .",
    "it leads to a cross section for the standard model higgs of about 3 fb at @xmath9  tev for @xmath10 gev , but extensions of the standard model such as the mssm can yield larger cross sections .",
    "this durham model has later been applied for production of @xmath11 @xcite , gluon @xcite and heavy quark dijets @xcite , etc . , and has been compared with data from the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "we will use this standard theoretical description in what follows .",
    "one of the main motivations for considering central exclusive higgs production is that in inclusive higgs searches , using the decay @xmath12 is complicated due to the huge background from qcd jets . in cep , there is a suppression of @xmath13 production from qcd events due to spin - parity conservation in the forward limit .",
    "however , recent studies of various sources of irreducible @xmath13 background  @xcite have revealed a potential problem at low statistics , as the signal - to - background ratio turns out to be close to one whereas the absolute cross section is of the order of 1  fb . however , the overall theoretical uncertainty is rather large ( an uncertainty of about a factor of 25 is claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and it is possible that the cross section is larger .",
    "this situation makes it interesting to consider other possible ways to probe the higgs sector in cep .    in this paper",
    ", we therefore propose a new potentially interesting channel , namely central exclusive production of the charged higgs boson in association with a @xmath0 boson .",
    "this is a standard process in inclusive searches , and we will show below that the cep cross section is large enough in some regions of parameter space to be useful at the lhc . if the charged higgs would be observed this way , it would give important information on the properties of the higgs sector .    to be specific , we choose to use the 2hdm as a prototype in our calculations .",
    "we will make one simplification .",
    "as we are here interested in examining the feasibility of the associated production channel , we want to consider the maximum possible cross sections .",
    "these occur when there is an @xmath14-channel resonance involved , and cross sections away from the resonance are bound to be smaller .",
    "we will therefore concentrate on the case when the cross section is resonantly enhanced .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in some regions of the parameter space of 2hdms , the associated production cross section can be enhanced compared with the mssm by orders of magnitude .",
    "our results can be seen as a proof of principle , but can be applied to more general models for physics beyond the sm . in particular , we will briefly discuss the nmssm as one interesting example .",
    "the general two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) has two scalar doublets @xmath15 with the same hypercharge @xmath16 . setting parameters that break the @xmath17 symmetry explicitly to zero but keeping the soft - breaking parameter @xmath18 , the most general scalar potential is given by @xmath19\\nonumber\\\\ & + { \\frac{1}{2}}\\lambda_1(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1)^2 + { \\frac{1}{2}}\\lambda_2(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\lambda_3(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1)(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2 ) + \\lambda_4(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_1 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & + { \\frac{1}{2}}\\left[\\lambda_5(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)^2   + { \\rm h.c . }",

    "however , @xmath21 only appears in the couplings between higgs bosons and gauge bosons in the combinations @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "one should keep in mind that @xmath24 is not _ a priori _ a physical parameter , and the potential ( [ v ] ) is in fact invariant under u(2 ) rotations of the doublets . in specific models ,",
    "however , a specific basis , and thus a specific value of @xmath24 , is singled out as a physical parameter .    for completely general yukawa couplings of the different higgs bosons ,",
    "one encounters unacceptably large flavor - changing neutral currents mediated by higgs exchange .",
    "glashow and weinberg showed @xcite that these vanish if each fermion only couples to one higgs doublet , and one therefore usually defines four types of 2hdm , fancifully called type i , ii , iii and iv , or sometimes y and x for the last two .",

    "i , instead , all fermions couple to the same doublet . in the following",
    "we will consider both type i and type ii models .    in order for the central exclusive production mechanism to have a cross section in the interesting range",
    ", the mass of the charged higgs boson must be relatively low .",
    "the experimental bounds on @xmath25 are the strictest in the type ii model , where one has , roughly , @xmath26  gev  @xcite . in the type i model ,",
    "however , for @xmath273 there is essentially no bound beyond the model independent bound that @xmath28  gev  @xcite . for this reason",
    ", we shall take the type i model as our principal prototype .",
    "it could also be interesting to consider the type x model , where @xmath29 can also be light , see e.g.  @xcite for a detailed study of its phenomenology .",
    "the type  i results we show below correspond to models that are allowed by all existing data .    because it is hard to find regions in the mssm parameter space where the charged higgs is light",
    ", we shall not consider the mssm here . in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) on the other hand",
    ", the charged higgs can easily be quite light ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and central exclusive production can be interesting .",
    "supersymmetric models also have a contribution to the production amplitudes from squark loops , which can potentially be large and positive .    to keep the analysis simple",
    ", we will leave a detailed study of nmssm , and supersymmetric models in general , for the future . instead we will in addition to the type i results also show results for the 2hdm type ii model , which is more similar to susy models .",
    "however , note that these type ii results are not to be taken literally , since they have light charged higgs bosons that are not allowed by flavor data .",
    "the reason that we still find this interesting is that in the nmssm the charged higgs is allowed to be light .",
    "the type ii results should therefore be seen as an example .      in the type i model ,",
    "the fermions get their masses from only one of the higgs doublets .",
    "the dependence of the yukawa couplings on @xmath21 and @xmath30 is therefore the same for the up and down type fermions . if the mixing @xmath21 is either zero or @xmath31 , the @xmath2 or the @xmath1 does not couple to the fermions at all .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the three neutral scalars to top and bottom quarks relative to the couplings of the sm higgs boson @xmath32 are in the type i model given by @xmath33 in the type ii model there is the well - known large @xmath24-enhancement of the down - type fermion couplings .",
