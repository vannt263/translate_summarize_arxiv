    "the ferrimagnetic spin fluctuation originates from the interband fluctuation mainly between @xmath20 and @xmath19 sites .",
    "the interband fluctuation relates to the zerolines bounded by two dirac points in the brillouin zone .",
    "such zeroline does not exist in the wave function of graphene , since carbon atoms in two sublattice are equivalent owing to the inversion symmetry , which corresponds to @xmath21 and @xmath32 sites in @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1i@xmath2 .",
    "thus the present results reveal that the inequivalence of bedt - ttf sites play important roles for observables in nmr as an inner degree of freedom of dirac electron in molecular conductor with the short range coulomb interaction .",
    "there remain problems to be clarified . in the low temperature region for @xmath154 ,",
    "@xmath16 for all components are convex downward with decreasing @xmath13 @xcite , and @xmath26 exhibits complex @xmath13-dependence for very low temperatures @xcite in the presence of magnetic field perpendicular to the conducting plane .",
    "those behavior can not be explained within the random phase approximation on the on - site coulomb interaction .",
    "it indicates an importance of a higher order correction such as self - energy correction with the long range coulomb interaction , at low temperatures , low energy phenomena in the vicinity of dirac point is dominant and then scale of length is much longer than lattice constant .",
    "the valley splitting owing to the pseudo - spin xy ferromagnetism in @xmath155 landau states @xcite may also play significant roles at very low temperatures in the presence of magnetic field perpendicular to the conducting plane .",
    "the authors are thankful to k. ishikawa , m. hirata , k. miyagawa and k. kanoda for fruitful discussions .",
