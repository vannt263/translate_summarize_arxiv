    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) contain a late - type ` normal ' star of @xmath1m@xmath2 accreting via roche lobe overflow onto a black hole or neutron star .",
    "black hole systems are mostly only active during transient outbursts , making them difficult targets for techniques requiring phase - resolved spectroscopy such as doppler tomography .",
    "many neutron star systems are persistently active , but with a few exceptions are sufficiently faint that they are still difficult targets . amongst the bright exceptions , only her x-1 has seen extensive application of doppler tomography @xcite . this is a very unusual system with a companion star more massive than the neutron star , and not strictly an lmxb at all .",
    "we will focus here on the more limited data available on ` typical ' lmxbs , i.e.  those in which the companion star is a late - type dwarf .",
    "we begin by summarising our own work on a transient neutron star system , xtej2123058 and then compare this with other lmxbs .",
    "the transient lmxb xtej2123058 was discovered by _ rxte _ on 1998 june 27 @xcite and promptly identified with a 17th magnitude blue star with an optical spectrum typical of transients in outburst @xcite .",
    "type - i x - ray bursts @xcite indicated the compact object to be a neutron star . a pronounced photometric modulation @xcite on the orbital period of 6.0hr @xcite is due to the changing aspect of the x - ray heated companion indicating a high inclination system .",
    "during the outburst we obtained extensive photometry @xcite and phase - resolved spectroscopy @xcite ; this section will focus on the latter .",
    "we observed xtej2123058 using the isis dual - beam spectrograph on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) on the nights of 1998 july 1820 .",
    "full details and discussion of the data analysis are given in @xcite .",
    "phase resolved data suitable for doppler tomography were obtained on july 1920 ( approximately one binary orbit each night ) with an unvignetted wavelength range of @xmath340006500  and spectral resolution 2.94.1 .",
    "the emission lines show significant changes over an orbital cycle ( fig .",
    "[ absfig ] ) .",
    "heii  4686  shows complex changes in line position and structure , with two s - waves apparently interweaving .",
    "the light curve reveals a strong peak near phase 0.75 and a weaker one near 0.25 .    .",
    "in the latter , the transient absorption can be seen as the white region.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    we have used doppler tomography @xcite to identify heii4686  emission sites in velocity space ( fig.[tomographyfig]a ) .",
    "one of the fundamental assumptions of doppler tomography , that we always see all of the line flux at _ some _ velocity , is clearly violated , however , as the integrated line flux is not constant .",
    "we attempt to account for this by normalising the line profiles . without normalisation",
    "the structure of the derived tomogram is very similar , so our results do not appear to be sensitive to this difficulty",

    "these were derived from results of fits to outburst light curves @xcite .",
    "the parameters we assume are @xmath4day , @xmath5 , @xmath6m@xmath7 , @xmath8m@xmath7 , @xmath9 ; see @xcite for discussion .",
    "the dominant emission site ( corresponding to the main s - wave ) appears on the opposite side of the neutron star from the companion .",
    "for any system parameters , it is inconsistent with the heated face of the companion and the stream / disc impact point .",
    "there is a fainter spot near the @xmath10 point , corresponding to the fainter s - wave , which is possibly associated with the accretion stream .",
    "these spots in the tomogram may be joined , although this may be a smoothing artifact of the reconstruction .",
    "it is notable that nearly all the emission has a lower velocity than that of keplerian material at the outer disc edge , and so if associated with the disc requires sub - keplerian velocities .",
    "the phenomenon of emission concentrated in the lower - left hand quadrant of a doppler tomogram at low velocities is not new ; it is one of the distinguishing characteristics of the sw  sex class of cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "these are all novalike variables , typically seen at a relatively high inclination .",
    "the tomograms are not the only similarity .",
    "sw  sex systems exhibit transient absorption lines which are strongest near phase 0.5 or slightly earlier and are moderately blue shifted .",
    "transient absorption near phase 0.5 is seen in h@xmath0  in xtej2123058 ( fig .",
    "[ absfig ] ) . it begins slightly redshifted and moves to the blue , and can be clearly seen in a trailed spectrogram .",
    "examination of the average spectrum for phases 0.350.55 confirms that this is real absorption below the continuum level .",
    "the only other short - period neutron star lmxb with published doppler tomography is 2a1822371 @xcite .",
    "this was observed in h@xmath0  and exhibited disc emission enhanced towards the stream impact point .",
    "similar behaviour is suggested by a radial velocity analysis of heii  @xcite .",
    "this is different to what we see in xtej2123058 .",
    "non - tomographic analysis of other short - period neutron star lmxbs in an active state , however , suggests a similar behaviour to that described for xtej2123058 as shown in fig .",
    "[ compfig ] where we overplot the heii  radial velocity information for other systems on our heii  doppler tomogram .",
    "2a1822371 is clearly the odd one out , and the other systems ( 4u2129 + 47 @xcite , exo0748676 @xcite , 4u1636536 @xcite and 4u1735444 @xcite ) all show emission centred in the lower or lower - left part of the tomogram .",
    "various models have been proposed for the sw  sex phenomenon including bipolar winds , magnetic accretion and variations on a stream overflow theme .",
    "current opinion favours the latter interpretation , with the stream either being accelerated out of the roche lobe by a magnetic propeller , or re - impacting the disc .",
    "both of these models are discussed in more detail below .",
    "it is possible to explain the behaviour of the heii  4686  line in terms of the magnetic propeller model .",
    "the essence of this model is that in the presence of a rapidly rotating magnetic field , accreting diamagnetic material may be accelerated tangentially , leading to it being ejected from the system .",
    "the field might be anchored on the compact object , as in the prototype propeller ae  aqr @xcite or in the disc itself @xcite .",
    "we adopt the parameterisation used by @xcite and construct a simple model of a propeller in xtej2123058 .",
    "full details are given in @xcite .",
    "we can readily find a trajectory which passes through the central emission on the tomogram .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ tomographyfig]b , together with two bracketing trajectories corresponding to more and less acceleration . for a plausible model",
    ", we also require an explanation for why one particular place on the trajectory is bright . such an explanation is offered by @xcite : there is a point outside the binary at which trajectories intersect . at this point , faster moving blobs cross the path of slower blobs and enhanced emission might be expected .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ tomographyfig]c . to facilitate a quantitative comparison of our data with the model , the region a in fig .",
    "[ tomographyfig]c encloses points with velocities consistent with the bright emission spot .",
    "these points are indeed located where the trajectories cross .",
    "our data are therefore consistent with the emission mechanism suggested by @xcite .",
    "if the region in which accelerated blobs collide is optically thick in the line then emission is expected predominantly from the inner edge of this region where fast moving blobs impact slow moving blobs . for the geometry we have considered , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ tomographyfig]c , this will result in emission predominantly towards the top of the figure .",
    "this corresponds to seeing maximum emission near phase 0.75 , exactly as is observed in our data .",
    "can we also explain the phase - dependent balmer absorption ?",
    "the region b in fig .",
    "[ tomographyfig]c encloses points which would absorb disc emission with the phasing and velocities observed in h@xmath0 .",
    "this region can be attributed to lower - velocity trajectories which fall back towards the disc ; thus the transient absorption can be accommodated in this model .    in summary ,",
    "a magnetic propeller model can account for both heiiemission kinematics and lightcurve and h@xmath0  transient absorption .",
    "this requires blobs to be ejected with a range of velocities ; absorption is caused by low velocity blobs , perhaps because these account for most of the ejected mass .",
    "emission is only seen from higher velocity blobs , which might be expected to exhibit more energetic collisions .",
    "the model has some difficulties , however , both for a field anchored on the compact object and for a disc - anchored field .",
    "if the field is anchored on the compact object then it must rotate very fast , as spin periods of neutron stars are typically of order milliseconds .",
    "for such rapid rotation we must consider the light - cylinder , defined by the radius at which the magnetic field must rotate at the speed of light to remain synchronised with the compact object spin @xcite . outside of this radius , @xmath11 for xtej2123058 , the magnetic field will be unable to keep up and hence becomes wound up .",
    "this will make the propeller less effective , although it may still produce some acceleration ( wynn priv .",
    "comm . , 2000 ) . the disc - anchored propeller",
    "@xcite also has problems , in that it should very efficiently remove angular momentum from the disc ( wynn & king priv.comm . , 1999 ) , but this could perhaps be overcome if only a small fraction of stream material passes through the propeller . finally , when a propeller coexists with a disc , there is the added difficulty in explaining how the accelerated material clears the disc rim . in the case of the disc - anchored propeller",
    "one can argue that field loops emerging from the disc could accelerate material upwards as well as out ; for a propeller anchored on the neutron star some other explanation would be needed .",
    "the most popular alternative explanation for the sw sex phenomenon is the accretion stream overflow and re - impact model .",
    "this was originally suggested by @xcite ; for a recent exposition see @xcite .",
    "this model has the advantage of being physically very plausible .",
    "some stream overflow is implied by the observations of x - ray dips in some lmxbs , and overflowing material should re - impact in the inner disc if not supported in some way .",
    "to explain the observations , however , requires a number of additional elements .    in this model",
    "the overflowing stream can be thought of in two regions .",
    "the initial part of the stream produces the transient absorption when seen against the brighter background of the disc .",
    "the latter part , where the overflow re - impacts the disc , is seen in emission giving rise to the high velocity component . in the simplest form of the model ,",
    "the overflow stream should produce absorption at all phases ; it always obscures some of the disc .",
    "this problem is overcome by invoking a strongly flared disc so that the overflow stream is only visible near phase 0.5 . in xtej2123058 , however , the neutron star is directly visible , so the disc area that can be obscured by a flare is limited and it is harder to reproduce the depth and transience of the absorption .",
    "a further difficulty is that to produce emission at the low velocities observed requires disc emission which is sub - keplerian by a significant amount .",
    "this problem is not peculiar to xtej2123058 but common to the sw  sex class in general .",
