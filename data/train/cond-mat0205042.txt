    "a particularly successful approach to describe the statistical properties of the eigenfunctions of chaotic billiards , dating back to berry @xcite , assumes that at any point not too close to the boundary the wave function can be described by a random superposition of plane waves , @xmath0 where the modulus @xmath1 of the incoming waves is fixed , but directions @xmath2 and amplitudes @xmath3 are considered as random . in billiards with time - reversal symmetry",
    "there is in addition the restriction that the wave function has to be real .",
    "this ansatz can not be strictly true .",
    "it completely ignores the boundary conditions at the billiard walls , but this is of no importance as long as the wave length is small compared to the billiard size .    as a consequence one expects a gaussian distribution for the wave function amplitudes @xmath4 , or , equivalently , a porter - thomas distribution for their squares @xmath5 . for the spatial auto - correlation function",
    "@xmath6 a bessel function is found .",
    "these predictions were first verified by mcdonald and kaufman in their disseminating papers on stadium wave functions @xcite .",
    "it is impossible to mention all works which have been published hitherto on this subject . as another consequence of ansatz ( [ eq : superposition ] )",
    "the gradient of the wave function is gaussian distributed , too , and uncorrelated to the wave function .",
    "this has been used to calculate the distribution of eigenvalue velocities and the velocity auto - correlation function for the case of a local parameter variation @xcite .",
    "the approach is not restricted to quantum - mechanical systems , or systems where there is a one - to - one correspondence to quantum mechanics such as quasi - two - dimensional microwave billiards .",
    "porter - thomas distributions are found as well in the squared amplitudes of vibrating plates @xcite . in an experiment on a three - dimensional sinai microwave billiard , having no quantum mechanical equivalent , the electromagnetic field distributions as well as their spatial correlations could be explained assuming a random superposition of plane electromagnetic fields @xcite . in a very recent experiment on light propagation through distorted wave guides ,",
    "finally , the observed transversal field patterns could be described again by ansatz ( [ eq : superposition ] ) @xcite .",
    "all these examples show that the random - superposition - of - plane - waves approach is not of a quantum - mechanical origin , but holds for all types of waves .    if the billiard is opened , or if time - reversal symmetry is broken , the wave function acquires an imaginary part , @xmath7 with the consequence that in dependence of the relative fractions of real and imaginary parts the distribution of @xmath5 changes from porter - thomas to single exponential behavior .",
    "an explicit formula describing the distribution in the transition regime has been given by different authors @xcite .",
    "the same function has been derived by eba _",
    "et al . _ for the distribution of scattering matrix elements in a partially opened microwave billiard @xcite .",

    "more recently the interest focussed on the current statistics in open systems .",

    "the properties of current vortices have been studied by berry and dennis , who gave analytic expressions for different types of vortex spatial auto - correlation functions @xcite .",
    "independently , such auto - correlation functions as well as the distribution of nearest distances between nodal points have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "+       experimental results on current statistics and the distribution of nodal points have not been available as yet .",
    "the method of choice to study such questions are microwave techniques . in a previous work of our group",
    "we could demonstrate that currents can be easily obtained in an open microwave billiard @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show results on current distributions in two types of billiards , verifying a number of predictions given in the above mentioned papers for the first time also in experiment .",
    "the basic principles of the experiment are described in detail in ref .",
    "therefore we concentrate on the aspects being of relevance to the present study .",
    "two different billiards have been used , both resonators have a size of about 25  cm and a height of 8  mm .",
    "one of them is an open system of a rectangular shape with rounded corners and two openings on opposite sides containing entrance and exit antenna ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : billiards]c ) .",
    "a third movable antenna was used to map the field distribution in the resonator on a square grid of period 5  mm .",
    "the same system was used for a quantum - dot analog study previously @xcite .",
    "the two fixed antennas have a metallic core of diameter 1  mm , and a teflon coating for stronger coupling ; the movable antenna was a thin wire of diameter 0.2  mm .",
    "the lenghts of all antennas were about 6  mm .",
    "the quantity directly accessible in the experiment is the scattering matrix @xcite . from a reflection measurement as a function of the antenna position a mapping of the modulus of the wave function",
    "can be obtained ; to get the sign as well , the transmission between two antennas is needed . by the presence of the antennas the resonances",
    "are somewhat broadened and shifted , but in chaotic systems this does not change the universal distributions .",
    "( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "the second system studied is a robnik , or limaon billiard @xcite .",
    "it can be obtained by a complex mapping of the unit circle in the complex plain by means of the function @xmath8 .",

    "for this parameter the billiard is believed to be completely chaotic .",

    "ferrites have been used already repeatedly for this purpose @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the function principle of the ferrites will be given in a forthcoming publication @xcite . during reflection at the ferrite the microwaves experience a phase shift with the consequence that there will be currents through the billiard though it is completely closed .",
    "these currents are a complete analogue to the persistent currents observed in mesoscopic structures @xcite , for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite . they will be the subject of a separate publication @xcite .",
    "in addition there will be currents due to the fact that the ferrite introduces considerable absorption into the system . in the present context it is not of relevance whether the currents are due to a break of time reversal symmetry or due to absorption .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that in quasi - two - dimensional billiards the poynting vector @xmath10 can be written as @xmath11,\\ ] ] showing that there is a one - to - one correspondence with the current density @xmath12\\ ] ] in the corresponding quantum - mechanical system .",
    "a measurement of the electric field in the resonator including the phase thus immediately yields the poynting vector and by means of the mentioned analogy the current density .",

    "the unavoidable leakage current into the probe antenna is negligible .",
    "there are situations , however , where there is no or only little flow , e.g. for the open dot , if the total transmission is close to zero , or for the ferrite billiard , if there are strong standing waves present , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : billiards]a . in such cases",
    "the leakage current is no longer negligible , and may even become dominating . there is only one way to avoid this problem : the frequencies have to be chosen such that the overall amplitudes are moderate . as an example fig .",

    "it is identical with the rotation of the current density , @xmath35    the calculation of the corresponding distribution function @xmath36 follows exactly the same lines as for the current distribution and yields @xmath37 where @xmath38 can be taken directly from the experiment .",

    "the experimental study of the vortices is more difficult than that of the different types of distribution functions discussed above , since it involves the determination of the zeros of real and imaginary part of the wave function . because of the applied grid period of 5 mm , the precision in determining distances is only moderate , and , more problematically , it is impossible to resolve vortices lying very close together which is very often the case for vortices with different sign . in this situation a reliable determination of the distance distribution is not possible .",
    "the determination of the charge correlation function @xmath51 , too , did not work because of the cancellation of positive and negative terms , leading to an intolerable increase of the noise level .",
