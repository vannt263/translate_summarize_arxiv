    "in the mit bag model , a hadron is regarded as a finite region of space where quark and gluon fields are confined .",
    "the bag energy necessary to fit hadron masses must contain a term of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the bag radius and @xmath2 is a phenomenological positive constant of order one @xcite .",
    "it is commonly accepted that this term is essentially a manifestation of zero point energies of the confined fields , however an understanding of this effect in the context of casimir energy calculations remains intriguing .",
    "these calculations consider gluons as free massless particles inside the bag , an assumption based on asymptotic freedom .",

    "the renormalized zero - point energy contribution to the mit bag energy contains the term @xmath3 , but with a negative @xmath2 ( @xmath4 ) , that is , a repulsive effect is obtained , instead of the attractive one necessary to adjust hadron spectroscopy . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no explanation in the literature for this discrepancy . for a discussion of the bag model and the current status of casimir calculations in the bag see refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "a resolution to the sign problem is hard to accomplish as in general there is no intuition whether the casimir energy should be positive or negative in a given situation . in general",

    "on the other hand , any treatment of qcd with boundaries requires simplifying assumptions to render the calculation possible . in this regard",
    ", we note that the above mentioned simple model considering free massless gluons inside the bag only encodes nonperturbative information by imposing boundary conditions on the bag boundary , while the free propagator is taken over the whole range of momenta that can be accommodated inside the bag .",
    "this means , momenta ranging typically from the inverse bag radius up to the ultraviolet region .",
    "we would like to stress that infrared modes are more sensitive to the bag geometry , and these are precisely modes in the nonperturbative region of qcd .",
    "this situation , shows that any improvement to obtain an attractive casimir energy must take into account intrinsic nonperturbative effects inside the bag such as the analytic structure qcd .    at present",
    ", a derivation of the casimir energy from first principles seems hopelessly out of reach . in this work",
    "we would like to propose instead a possible understanding of the attractive nature of vacuum fluctuations , based on a simple bag model extended to incorporate an infrared modified gluon propagator .",
    "the associated infrared behavior will be motivated by recent studies on the analytic structure of the confined gluon propagator in pure qcd @xcite .",
    "in qcd it is believed that colored objects such as quarks and gluons can not exist in asymptotic states .",
    "they should give place instead to the hadronic spectrum .",
    "these open problems are associated with a nonperturbative regime , and suppossed to be driven by the dynamical generation of a mass scale , which separates the perturbative and nonperturbative phases .    in the bag model ,",
    "the boundary condition is devised to represent the nonperturbative physics associated with the finite size of colorless objects such as hadrons .",
    "now , regarding the renormalized vacuum energy , if it is computed by considering the gluon sector only ( quenched model ) , the inclusion of additional nonperturbative information is a sensible modification to be considered .    in this",
    "regard , note that such a calculation would be based on pure qcd proved by means of a boundary condition on a sphere of radius r. of course , for very small @xmath1 , the effect of the boundaries would be relevant , while , because of asymptotic freedom , the physics inside the bag would essentially be perturbative . on the other hand , for very large @xmath1",
    ", the model would behave as pure qcd without boundaries , displaying the intrinsic nonperturbative behavior of the gluon sector .    for typical values of @xmath1 associated with nonperturbative objects such as hadrons",
    ", both effects should be relevant when computing the renormalized vacuum energy : finite size effects representing the hadron boundaries , as well as intrinsic nonperturbative behavior in the gluon sector .",
    "in particular , possible nonperturbative analytic properties in this sector constitute an interesting aspect to be explored .    in this section , according to the discussion above , an infrared modified bag model is presented .",
    "the basic physical inputs are the following : + @xmath5 as usual , we will consider the hadron as a finite region in space where the fields are confined by imposing a boundary condition at the bag boundary .",
    "+ @xmath5 additional intrinsic nonperturbative information will be parametrized in a model gluon propagator @xmath6 associated with an effective quadratic gluon action inside the bag .",
    "although this procedure can not be justified from first principles , similar ideas have been already used in different hadron models where some interesting results have been obtained @xcite . this enables the computation of the vacuum energy by means of the usual formula , @xmath7 with @xmath6 in the place of the free gluon propagator @xmath8 . in this equation",
    ", @xmath9 is the infinite time that the configuration exists and @xmath10 refers to the eigenvalues of the laplace operator in the corresponding geometrical configuration . as in former studies , we are considering a scalar casimir energy to be multiplied by the number of polarization modes of the gluon field ( including color ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . + @xmath5 the model gluon propagator @xmath6 incorporates nonperturbative effects such as pole suppression .",
    "that is , we will change the free @xmath8 ( @xmath11 ) propagator used in previous works , which is valid in the ultraviolet region due to asymptotic freedom , by an infrared modified one . after a wick rotation @xmath12",
    ", the behavior of the modified propagator can be defined in euclidean @xmath13 momentum space , @xmath14 this type of infrared vanishing behavior has been obtained in different scenarios ( see the discussion below ) . for large @xmath15 , we have also included a possible @xmath16 factor encoding running coupling constant information .",
    "note also that the free propagator would correspond to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "+ when computing casimir energies , we believe that the above mentioned simple model can capture the essential modifications implied by the analytic structure of qcd . with regard to the behavior in ( [ beh ] ) , we are motivated by recent progress on the form of the gluon propagator in pure qcd . in general , because of confinement , we know that the gluon propagator must suffer a dramatic change when @xmath19 : as gluons can not appear in asymptotic states , the free pole at @xmath20 must disappear in the complete theory .",
    "in fact , many authors coincide that the exact propagator should be infrared finite when @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , an infrared vanishing behavior has been obtained in different scenarios : by studying the schwinger - dyson equation @xcite , by restricting the path integral so as to avoid gribov copies @xcite , and also in a lattice formulation @xcite . in other words , different scenarios point to an intrinsic analytic structure in pure qcd associated with an infrared suppressed propagator , describing the so called `` confined '' gluons , in contrast to an infrared enhanced `` confining '' @xmath22 behavior ( for a review , see ref .",

    "as we are concerned with a model gluon propagator , we will first develop a casimir energy calculation based on the associated general analytic properties displayed in minkowski space , not relying on a specific form for the propagator .",
    "we will obtain a representation for the casimir energy where the analytic structure of the model and the effects of geometry will be clearly distinguished . only at the end",
    "we will discuss the effect of pole suppression on the renormalized vacuum energy .",

    "<S> in this work , we are motivated by previous attempts to derive the vacuum contribution to the bag energy in terms of familiar casimir energy calculations for spherical geometries . </S>",
    "<S> a simple infrared modified model is introduced which allows studying the effects of the analytic structure as well as the geometry in a clear manner . in this context , we show that if a class of infrared vanishing effective gluon propagators is considered , then the renormalized vacuum energy for a spherical bag is attractive , as required by the bag model to adjust hadron spectroscopy . </S>"
