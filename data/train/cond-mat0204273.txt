    "nowadays progress in nanotechnology made it possible to produce nanostructures with new physical phenomena .",
    "this has led to renewed attention to hybrid systems consisting of superconductor ( @xmath5 ) and ferromagnetic ( @xmath2 ) metals , and displaying rich and elegant physics and having potential applications .",
    "transport properties of @xmath0 structures with artificial geometry have turned out to be quite unusual . these have been treated by several authors [ 1 - 9 ] , and the obtained results show that in ferromagnet the cooper pair potential not only exponentially decays but also has an oscillatory character ; i.e. , in a ferromagnet the density of cooper pairs is spatially inhomogeneous and the superconducting  order parameter contains nodes where the phase changes by @xmath4 .",
    "this causes the exchange field dependence of the josephson coupling energy , and if the exchange energy @xmath6 in magnetic layer exceeds a certain value ,  a crossover from @xmath7-phase to @xmath4-phase superconductivity takes place .",
    "the phenomenon has been theoretically described for @xmath8 weak links with thick @xmath2 layer [ 1 - 5 ] .",
    "the crossover to the @xmath4-state even in the absence of the order parameter oscillations in thin @xmath2 layer was also predicted for @xmath1 tunnel junctions ( where @xmath9 is an insulator ) with parallel alignment of layer s magnetization [ 6 ] . for an antiparallel orientation ,",
    "the possibility of the critical current enhancement by the exchange interaction in @xmath1 junctions with thin @xmath2 layers was discussed both for small [ 7 ] and bulk [ 8 ]  @xmath5  layer thicknesses .",
    "experimentally , the @xmath4-phase superconductivity has been observed for @xmath8  weak links [ 9 ] and @xmath10 [ 10 ] and @xmath11  [ 11 ] tunnel junctions with thick @xmath2 layers , while the enhancement of the dc josephson current has not been detected until  now .",
    "some features should be taken into account for theory to be adjustable for experimental results on @xmath0 structures , and the spin - flip processes are among the important ones .",
    "these processes can be induced , e.g. , by the spin - orbit scattering centers presented in the film ; other important source of the spin - flip processes for nanoscale hybrid structures is a  strong electric field arising near metal - metal boundaries [ 12 ] .",
    "the basic physics behind spatial  oscillations of induced superconductivity in @xmath0 sandwiches with spin - orbit scattering has been recently discussed in [ 3,13 ] .",
    "as is known , in the presence of spin - orbit scattering the electron spin is no longer a good quantum number and the electron will change its spin state during a characteristic time @xmath12 , while the cooper pair will mix with its spin - exchanged counterpartner .",
    "this causes a pair to  feel  an exchange field which changes sign at a rate proportional to @xmath13 , decreasing the average ferromagnetic field experienced by the pair .",
    "that means , that the spin - flip processes not only modify the oscillation length but also lead to an extra decay of the cooper pair potential and , at a critical strength , these scattering processes can completely suppress the @xmath14-phase superconductivity .",
    "the scenario of the @xmath15-phase transition , as well as the mechanisms of critical current enhancement , in the limit of thin @xmath2 layers differ from those for thick @xmath2 layers . however , the basic physics behind spin - orbit scattering effect for the @xmath0 sandwiches where there is no induced order parameter oscillations , has not been discussed till now .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify the mechanisms of influence of spin - orbit scattering on critical current in @xmath1 tunnel structures with thin @xmath2 layers .",
    "our analysis is based on the extension of calculations [ 6,8,14 ] , so as to include the effects of the spin - orbit scattering .",
    "namely , we study the tunnel junction with leads formed by the proximity coupled @xmath0 bilayers of a massive @xmath16-wave superconductor and a thin @xmath2 metals , when the spin - orbit scattering processes take place in ferromagnetic layers . the microscopic model of the proximity effect for @xmath0 bilayer is employed to discuss the case of arbitrary value of @xmath0 boundary transparency , ferromagnetic exchange field , and proximity effect strength ( sec.ii ) .",
    "critical current of symmetrical @xmath1 junction is discussed in sec.iii where analytical solutions have been obtained for some particular cases .",
    "as we shall see , spin - flip scattering plays a major role in transport properties of superconductor - ferromagnet structures with thin @xmath2 layers and should be considered for understanding the various experimental results .",
    "we close with a conclusion .",
    "we consider the case when  both metals are in the dirty limit condition @xmath17 , and  the @xmath5 layer is thick , @xmath18 , while the @xmath2 layer is thin , @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the coherence lengths of the @xmath5 and @xmath2 metals ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the electron mean free paths , @xmath24 are the thicknesses , and @xmath25 are the diffusion coefficients of the @xmath5 and @xmath2 metals , respectively .",
    "these conditions make it possible to neglect the reduction of the critical temperature of the @xmath0 bilayer compared to that of the bulk @xmath5 metal , and to imply constant superconducting properties through @xmath2 layer thickness . throughout this work",
    "the @xmath2 layer will be treated as a single domain film with the spin - orbit scattering centers , while there are no such centers in the @xmath5 layer .",
    "then , the superconducting properties of the @xmath0 bilayer are described by the usadel equations [ 15 ] .",
    "the latter can be written as ( the domain @xmath26 is occupied by the @xmath5 metal and @xmath27 by the @xmath2 metal ) :    @xmath28^{\\prime } \\text { } % ,   \\label{ref1}\\ ] ]    @xmath29^{\\prime } + \\alpha _ { so}g_{f\\mp } ( \\frac{% \\phi _ { f\\mp } } { \\tilde{\\omega}_{\\mp } } -\\frac{\\phi _ { f\\pm } } { \\tilde{\\omega}% _ { \\pm } } ) \\ ] ]    here @xmath30 ,  @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , @xmath33 is matsubara frequency ; @xmath34  and @xmath12 is the spin - orbit scattering time ; the pair potential @xmath35 is determined by the usual self - consistency relations ( see , e.g. [ 16 ] ) .",
    "we define the @xmath36 axis as perpendicular to the film surfaces and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to a coordinate @xmath37 .",
    "the modified usadel functions [ 17 ] @xmath38 , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are normal and anomalous green s functions for the @xmath2 and @xmath5 material , respectively , are introduced  to take into account the normalized confinement of the green s functions @xmath42  ; here  @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ( see below ) .",
    "we also assume that for a nonsuperconducting @xmath2 metal the bare value of the order parameter @xmath45  , however , the cooper pair correlation function @xmath46 due to the proximity effect . eqs .",
    "( 2 ) for the @xmath2 metal are the generalization of the usadel equations for the  case when the spin - orbit scattering is present ( for more details see ref .",
    "[ 18 ] ) . at temperatures close to @xmath47 ,",
    "when @xmath48 and @xmath49 , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) have been simplified getting the form of eqs .",
    "( 26 ) of ref .",
    "if the spin - orbit processes are absent@xmath50  , the spin  up  and  down  subbands do not mix with each other and the equation ( 2 ) obtains the usual form ( see , e.g. , [ 6,14 ] ) .",
    "( 1 ) , ( 2 ) should be supplemented with the boundary conditions . in the bulk of the @xmath5 metal",
    "the pair potential is equal to the @xmath51 order parameter @xmath52  at the temperature @xmath53 : @xmath54 , while at the free ( dielectric ) interface of the @xmath2 metal :  @xmath55 .",
    "assuming that there are no spin - flip processes at the @xmath0 interface , the boundary conditions at this interface ( see ref .",
    "[ 14 ] for details ) can easily be generalized for the case of two fermionic subband in the form :    @xmath56    @xmath57    the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 involved in these relations are given by @xmath60 , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are the normal state resistances of the @xmath5 and @xmath2 metals , @xmath63 is the product of @xmath0 boundary resistance and its area . in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , and below we have used the effective coherence length @xmath64 thus providing the regular crossover to both limits @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the relation ( 3 ) provides the continuity of the supercurrent flowing through the @xmath0 interface at any value of the interface transparency for spin  up  and  down  fermionic subband separately , while the condition ( 4 ) accounts for the quality of the electric contact .",
    "an additional physical approximation for the relations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) to be valid is the assumption that spin discrimination by the interface is unimportant , i.e. , the interface parameters involved are the same for both spin subband",
    ". generalization of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) to the @xmath0 interface with different transmission probabilities for  up  and  down  spin quasiparticles is straightforward , however the case we consider contains all the new physics we are interested in and is simpler . in such ferromagnetic metals as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , etc .",
    "the polarization of the electrons at low temperatures is not more than 10% , and one can expect the model under consideration reflects the transport properties of these ferromagnets hybrid structures .",
    "due to a small thickness of the @xmath2 metal the proximity effect problem can be reduced to the boundary problem for the @xmath5 layer and a relation for determining @xmath69 at @xmath70 .",
    "there are three parameters which enter the model : @xmath71 ,  @xmath72 and the energy of the exchange field @xmath6  . using the system of equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 )",
    ", one can obtain the equations determining the unknown value of the functions @xmath73 and boundary conditions  for @xmath74 . due to these boundary conditions all the equations for the functions @xmath74 and @xmath69 are coupled . in the general case ,",
    "the problem needs self - consistent numerical calculations ( similar to those as , e.g. , in ref . [ 19 ] ) . here , however , we will not discuss the quantitative solution , but pay attention to the qualitative one to consider new physics we are interested in .",
    "we will hereinafter assume that @xmath75 and@xmath76 and solve differential equations by an iteration procedure finding the corrections to @xmath77 and@xmath78 in small parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to the quite realistic experimental case of a bilayer with a weak proximity effect and low transparency of the @xmath0 boundary , i.e. , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "then the problem is simplified ( see ref . [ 18 ] for details ) and reduced to the usadel eqs .",
    "( 1 ) for the @xmath5 layer with boundary conditions ( 3 ) , while eq . ( 4 ) reduces to    @xmath83    where we abbreviated @xmath84^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( functions that are multiplied by @xmath80 have been used in the limit @xmath87 ) .",
    "now , the equation for @xmath88 layer function @xmath73 has the form :    @xmath89|_{x=0}\\\\ ] ]    in zeroth approximation in @xmath90 the @xmath91 .",
    "so , we can neglect the suppression of superconductivity in the @xmath5 layer assuming that @xmath92 is spatially homogeneous : @xmath93 . in the next order in @xmath90 , by linearizing the usadel equations for the @xmath92 and making use of the relation ( 3 ) , the general solution of the linearized equation ( 1 ) is given by    @xmath94    where @xmath95 . substituting this solutions into the boundary relations ( 5 )",
    ", we get for @xmath96  :    @xmath97    using eqs . ( 7 ) for @xmath70 and relations ( 6 ) , one can find expressions for @xmath98 .",
    "however we will not show here these expressions because of their cumbersome structure . for @xmath99  the quantity @xmath100  ,  and solution ( 7 ) , ( 8) reproduces the results obtained in ref . [ 16 ]  for an @xmath101 bilayer . if @xmath102 , the expressions restore earlier results for @xmath103 bilayer ( see refs .  [ 6,14 ] ) .",
    "let us give some comments on the results obtained .",
    "for the structure under consideration , one can expect a kind of induced magnetic properties for @xmath5 layer , that are the result of the effect similar to the superconducting proximity effect [ 20 ] . in accordance with eqs .",
    "( 7 ) , ( 8) , we see that due to proximity induced magnetic correlations even in the @xmath5 layer fermionic symmetry of subbands has been lost and cooper pair mixes with its spin - exchanged counterpartner .",
    "we assume that both banks of the josephson @xmath1 tunnel junction are formed by equivalent @xmath0 bilayers , and the transparency of the insulating layer is small enough to neglect the effect of the tunnel current on the superconducting state of the electrons",
    ". the plane @xmath0 boundary can have arbitrary finite transparency , but it is large compared to the transparency of the junction barrier .",
    "the transverse dimensions of the junction are supposed to be much less then the josephson penetration depth , so all quantities depend only on a single co - ordinate @xmath36 normal to the interface surface of the materials . using the above obtained results",
    "we investigate the influence of the spin - flip scattering on critical josephson current in @xmath104 tunnel junction .",
    "the critical current of the ( @xmath105 tunnel contact can be written in the form ( see , e.g. ref . [ 6 ] ) :    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the resistance of the contact in the normal state ; the subscript @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) labels quantities referring to the left ( right ) bank and the sign of the exchange field depends on mutual orientation of the bank magnetizations .      for parallel alignment of the layer s magnetizations , i.e. , with @xmath110 , the expression for critical current reads :    @xmath111    we begin with an analytical consideration for the case of a vanishing effective pair breaking parameter near the @xmath0 boundary , @xmath112 ; i.e. , the influence of the @xmath2 layer on the superconducting properties of the @xmath5 metal can be neglected and the order parameter in the @xmath5 region is spatially homogeneous : @xmath113  ( see , eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) ) .  for the amplitude of the josephson current we than obtained    @xmath114^{2}+4h_{exc}^{2}\\bar{\\gamma}_{b}^{2}(g_{s}+\\bar{\\gamma}% _ { b}\\omega ) ^{2}\\}^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if @xmath99 the expression ( 11 ) restores the result for @xmath115 junction ( see , e.g. , eq.(28a ) of ref.[17 ] for parameters value under consideration ) . as is seen from this expression , for large enough @xmath6 , the supercurrent changes its sign , i.e. , with increasing magnetic energy the junction crosses over from @xmath7-phase type to @xmath4-phase type superconductivity .",
    "however , the spin - flip processes exert influence upon junction s tendency to set in the @xmath4-phase state .    on fig .",
    "1 we plot a  family of the josephson current amplitude ( 11 ) as function of @xmath6 when @xmath116 , @xmath112 for various values of the spin - orbit scattering intensity @xmath80 . here",
    "we also show the function @xmath117 .the main feature here is that the increase of the exchange energy pulls the @xmath1 junction to @xmath4-state .",
    "the new result of this figure is that , as intensity of spin - orbit scattering processes increases , the critical current amplitude , @xmath118 for the @xmath4-state decreases .",
    "the spin - orbit scattering reduces the effect of exchange field , and this reduction has nonlinear character with its maximum in the region where transition to the @xmath4-state take place .",
    "a more realistic case is shown on figs .",
    "2 , where we plot the results of numerical calculations of the critical current , eq . ( 10 ) , for the tunnel junction when suppression of the @xmath5  layer superconductivity occurs due to proximity effect @xmath119 .",
    "the function @xmath120 has also been shown .",
    "again , the main result of these calculations is that the spin - flip processes can sizably reduce the @xmath1 junction tendency to @xmath121-phase state .",
    "in contrast to a simple physical picture , the suppression has nonlinear behavior getting its maximum near @xmath6 region of cross over from @xmath7-type to @xmath4-type superconductivity . while our results have been obtained for the @xmath0 bilayers with  a weak proximity effect and low boundary transparency , qualitatively the conclusions are valid for arbitrary @xmath122 and @xmath90 values .",
    "to be definite , we took @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",

    ", the @xmath7-phase state across the contact has been preserved , and in some interval of the exchange field energy the enhancement of dc josephson current occurs .",
    "the spin - orbit processes exert upon this behavior , reducing the current enhancement .    on fig .",

    "we also plot the function @xmath129 .the main and unusual feature here is that the increase of the exchange energy enhances the @xmath1 junction critical current .",
    "the new result of this figure is that , as the intensity of spin - orbit scattering processes increases , the tendency of the @xmath130 to enhance decreases . the spin - orbit scattering reduces the effect of exchange field , and this reduction is nonlinear in character with its maximum in the most interesting for experimentalists region .",
