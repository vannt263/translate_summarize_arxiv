    "the past two decades have seen the discovery of a number of young ( age@xmath1100  myr ) stellar moving groups and associations within @xmath0100  pc of earth ( for reviews see @xcite and @xcite ) . by studying stars in these moving groups one can observe the evolution of stellar properties as a function of juvenile ages .",
    "nearby young stars and brown dwarfs are excellent targets for studies of gas - rich circumstellar disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) and direct imaging surveys of young jupiters ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at present , the initial mass functions of these young stellar groups are poorly determined for spectral types later than @xmath0m2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the field population of m dwarfs peaks strongly at spectral types m3m5 ( see @xcite , and references therein ) suggesting a significant number of nearby , young stars with spectral types later than m3 remains to be discovered .",
    "identification of additional young moving group members , particularly low - mass stars , is a key step both in our understanding of the processes involved in the early stages of stellar and substellar evolution and in searches for recently formed planets .",
    "given the incompleteness of the young moving groups at the low - mass end , many programs are actively searching for these  missing \" m - dwarfs with a variety of techniques ( e.g. , see @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "several techniques exploit the ultraviolet and x - ray properties of low - mass stars . as low - mass ( m@xmath11  @xmath2 ) pre - main sequence stars descend to the main sequence",
    ", their deep convective envelopes combine with differential rotation to produce strong magnetic dynamos .",
    "this stellar dynamo generates high levels of chromospheric and coronal activity ; the former is a source of ultraviolet ( uv ) emission while the latter contributes to x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "recent work @xcite has linked stellar activity due to youth with uv emission detected with the galaxy evolution explorer satellite ( galex ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that such uv - bright low - mass stars have ages @xmath0300  myr or younger , based on the strength of their x - ray emission ( see section  6 in @xcite ) .",
    "these low - mass stars are brightest at near - infrared wavelengths and thus are best identified with surveys such as the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "the recent release of the wide - field infrared survey explorer catalog ( wise ; @xcite ) has opened up the sky at additional near- to mid - infrared wavelengths beyond those covered with 2mass , facilitating the identification of cooler and fainter low - mass objects . the bright uv emission from the stellar chromosphere , combined with cool - star colors at optical and infrared wavelengths ,",
    "make the galex source catalog a powerful tool to search for nearby , young , low - mass stars .",
    "our prior work tying together uv emission with near - ir photometry was carried out for the scorpius - centaurus region and tw  hya association ( twa ; @xcite ) .",
    "this study introduced a method to identify candidate young stars via the combination of their ( a ) uv - ir colors , ( b ) estimated range of motion in the context of galactic space velocities for known young stellar groups , and ( c ) spectral signatures of youth . in the present work , we extend our methodology to incorporate the wise data , which permits characterization of the full spectral energy distribution of uv - bright stars , allows estimation of proper motions ( given the @xmath010 year baseline between wise and 2mass ) , and breaks the jhk color degeneracy for early- to mid - m dwarfs .",
    "we have also now extended our initial study to the entire galex - covered sky ( 61% of the total sky ) , allowing detection of thousands of candidate young low - mass stars , some of which may be members of previously undiscovered moving groups .",
    "we have also devised an algorithm to identify such potential stellar groups based on their similar proper motions and estimated distances ( section  [ fvalue ] ) and have carried out a convergent point analysis for several young moving groups ( section  [ cpanalysis ] ) .",
    "we refer to these collected efforts to identify young stars through the combination of galex and other catalog data as the galex nearby young - star survey ( galnyss ) . here",
    ", we describe our methodology and present the first galnyss results , with a focus on the tucana - horologium association .",
    "we have developed a search strategy that consists of combining the galex , 2mass , and wise catalog information to identify nearby , young , low - mass stars .",
    "this is similar to the work presented in @xcite , but revised to utilize wise data as well as improved isochrones and selection criteria .",
    "the steps in our identification sequence are as follows :    1 .",
    "combine ir and uv photometry to identify objects likely to be nearby , m - type dwarfs with uv excesses ( section  [ method : uv ] ) .",
    "2 .   use cataloged and calculated proper motions ( section  [ pminfo ] ) , combined with estimates of spectral types and photometric distances ( section  [ spectypes ] ) , to select the subset of these objects that are candidate m - type stars within @xmath0150  pc ( if 10  myr old ) and have uvw space motions similar to those of known young stellar groups ( section  [ uvw ] ) .",
    "3 .   perform spectroscopic followup of the best resulting candidates ( section  [ candidates ] ) to measure radial velocities along with spectral features , such as h@xmath3 emission and li absorption lines , that are diagnostic of youth ( section  [ specfollowup ] ) .      to identify candidate young",
    ", low - mass stars we first examine where in various color - color combinations known young stars ( as drawn from @xcite and @xcite ) lie with respect to other field galex sources .",
    "figure  [ jw2 ] demonstrates this in a combined galex - wise-2mass nuv ",
    "w1 vs.  j ",
    "w2 color - color diagram . here",
    "nuv is the near uv galex channel , w1 and w2 are the 3.4 and 4.6 @xmath4 m wise bands and j is from the 2mass catalog . as we demonstrate in section  [ spectypes ] , j ",
    "w2 color can be used as a proxy for spectral type . in figure  [ jw2 ] ,",
    "the young low - mass stars from @xcite and @xcite stand out with respect to earlier - type young stars , older field stars , and the galaxy population .",
    "the j  w2 colors of young , low - mass stars are red and , while their nuv ",
    "w1 colors are bluer than those of field stars , they are not as blue as typical galaxies ( nuv  w1 colors between 5 and 9 ) .",
    "figure  [ jw2 ] drives our main selection criteria , which are listed in table  [ select_criteria ] .",
    "the first two criteria define where known young , low - mass stars are located in color - color space .",
    "criterion # 3 is used to ensure our empirical spectral type relationship and isochrones are valid ( see section  [ spectypes ] ) .",
    "criterion # 4 ( from the wise catalog ) ensures there is only 1 2mass source associated with a given wise source within 3 .",
    "this avoids misassociation of ir sources in crowded fields , though such confusion is worst near the galactic plane , where galex has not observed .",
    "the remaining criteria are used to avoid saturated sources and to exclude contaminating , background galaxies .",
    "we note that members of young moving groups listed in @xcite are removed from the galnyss candidate tables prior to our analysis , to avoid re - identifying known young stars .",
    "however , other lists of proposed young stars ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) are not excluded .",
    "we make use of proper motion ( pm ) information to distinguish between candidate young stars and other uv excess sources , such as background galaxies or nearby flare stars .",
    "we have cross - correlated our sample against the ucac4 @xcite and ppmxl @xcite proper motion catalogs . in total ,",
    "@xmath056% and @xmath098% percent of our color - selected candidates have matches with objects listed in these respective catalogs .",
    "comparison with other catalogs shows that 92% of the uv excess sources have proper motions in supercosmos @xcite and 70% in usno - b1 @xcite . for any source that lacked a published proper motion ,",
    "a pm was estimated directly from the wise-2mass astrometry . with the @xmath010-year baseline and 3 cross - correlation radius ,",
    "these catalogs provide reasonable estimates of proper motion ( up to @xmath0300  mas / yr ) suitable for the first steps in our analysis .",
    "we note , however , a small ( @xmath01015  mas / yr ) systematic offset in the wise-2mass proper motions in the ra direction as a function of galactic latitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : pm2 ] shows this offset when examining over 300,000 sources in the ppmxl catalog .",
    "similar results are found when comparing with ucac4 and usno - b1 .",
    "the wise explanatory supplement mentions that , given that the wise astrometry is tied to that of 2mass and no proper motion information was considered for the 10-year baseline , the wise coordinate frame has a distortion relative to the international celestial reference system .",
    "a full correction is beyond the scope of this paper , but we attempt to remedy the ra offset with a linear term : @xmath5 here , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the proper motions in the ra direction before and after the correction .",
    "we note that this offset is smaller than the uncertainty we describe below .",
    "figure  [ fig : pm ] compares proper motions estimated from wise-2mass astrometry to those from ppmxl for the final list of @xmath02000 candidates in this study ( see section  [ candidates ] ) . from the rms scatter ,",
    "we conservatively adopt 25  mas / yr as an estimate of the uncertainty for objects without proper motions in published catalogs .",
    "we thus have at least one proper motion estimate for each candidate object , though in practice most objects have several estimates in good agreement with each other .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a list of m , l , and t - dwarfs identified with wise .",
    "we have used their sample and the wise-2mass photometry to derive an empirical relationship tying @xmath8 color to spectral type : @xmath9 spnum is the number past m0 , so 0=m0 , 5=m5 , 10=l0 , and so forth ( valid from k5/7l5 ) .",
    "figure  [ bd_jw2 ] shows the @xcite sources and our empirical relationship , which works best at spectral types late - k to late - m .",
    "we note that this relationship is not valid for l types later than @xmath0l5 and thus impose a color limit of w1w2@xmath10.6 , which selects objects earlier than l5 . despite this limit",
    ", we do not anticipate identifying a substantial number of bonafide uv - bright l - dwarfs : we have examined a list of 51 l - dwarf candidates within 40  pc ( from @xcite ) with galex and find that , although 41 of them lie in galex - covered regions , none are detected .",
    "similar results are found when searching among l and t dwarfs listed at dwarfarchives.org .",
    "candidates identified in the present program have spectral types predominantly in the m3m5 range , as estimated from the relationship above .",
    "these spectral types are , in general , accurate to @xmath101 subclass in the early- to mid - m dwarf range , as we demonstrate in section  [ specoverview ] .",
    "while some studies have presented redder colors for young l - dwarfs compared to older field dwarfs ( see @xcite , and references therein ) , this may not be the case for the m - dwarf spectral types we are sensitive to or to the j ",
    "w2 colors we use ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "warm circumstellar material in the system can produce more emission in the wise bands and thus make an object redder in j ",
    "w2 color , mimicking a later spectral type . a visual extinction of 1 magnitude , either due to a dusty disk or the intervening interstellar medium , would result in j ",
    "w2 colors redder by about 0.20.3 magnitudes @xcite . as can be seen in figure  [ bd_jw2 ] , an m5 dwarf , for example , may appear as an m7 or m8 given 1 magnitude of visual extinction towards the star .",
    "given the relative proximity of these stars to earth , extinctions this high are more likely due to dust within the system .",
    "note , however , that 1 magnitude of visual extinction would result in 2.96 magnitudes of extinction at nuv wavelengths @xcite , which might , in many or even most cases , lower the apparent uv excess and thereby remove an m - dwarf from consideration as young ( given our selection criteria ) .",
    "thus , in general , we expect galnyss sample objects with unusually late inferred spectral types to be dusty systems wherein a disk contributes to the system s mid - ir emission without obscuring the star .",
    "given that the ages of our candidates are unknown , we compute distances using two empirical isochrones , one for an age of @xmath010  myr and the other for an age of @xmath0100  myr . these isochrones are determined from known young , moving group stars ( figure  [ fig : iso ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : iso ] displays absolute k - band magnitude vs.  j ",
    "w2 color and shows members of the twa @xcite and other local groups , with ages @xmath010  myr @xcite , alongside pleiades candidates from @xcite and cool field dwarfs ( ages @xmath11100  myr ) from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a piecewise polynomial fit was performed for the @xmath010  myr - old stars and subsequently shifted down to match the locus of low - mass pleiades stars . for this work",
    "we adopt our @xmath0100  myr - old empirical isochrone given the greater agreement with the low - mass population of the pleiades and its estimated age of 100125  myr ( @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "the theoretical 100  myr nextgen isochrone dips down into the old ( @xmath11100  myr ) population for j  w2@xmath111.3 .",
    "we note that our empirical @xmath010  myr - old isochrone agrees within @xmath00.5  mag of the nextgen theoretical isochrone over the range 0.8@xmath1j  w2@xmath11.3 , corresponding to spectral types @xmath0m0m5 .",
    "a @xmath00.5  mag error in the absolute magnitude corresponds to a @xmath020% uncertainty in the distance .",
    "we thus expect that distances estimated from these isochrones are no more accurate than @xmath020% .",
    "although we extend our isochrones to j ",
    "w2 of 2.5 , this regime is constrained only by a few twa members , namely twa 26 , 27 , 28 , and 29 .",
    "these are m8m9 dwarfs with known parallax distances .",
    "the isochrones are best constrained at early or mid - m spectral types ( ie , 0.8@xmath1j ",
    "w2@xmath11.3 ) where more stars have been measured . subsequent work in identifying additional late - m members of these young groups will be key in constraining empirical isochrones and improving on existing theoretical pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks .",
    "an important step in confirming membership of candidate stars selected on the basis of their colors and proper motions is determination of galactic space velocities ( uvw ) .",
    "we define u as positive towards the galactic center , v positive in the direction of galactic rotation , and w positive towards the north galactic pole .",
    "because nearly all candidates lack radial velocities , we use the photometric 10 and 100  myr distance estimates ( as described above ) along with the positions and proper motions to estimate uvw with respect to the sun for a range of assumed radial velocities extending from @xmath12 to 80  km / s . @xcite",
    "define a  good uvw box \" that contains nearly all young stars within @xmath0100  pc of earth .",
    "we have used a somewhat broader version of this box extending to more negative u in order to account for members of the argus association , all of which have u@xmath022  km  s@xmath13 @xcite . if , for the range of radial velocity from @xmath12 to @xmath14  km  s@xmath13 , a star has uvw velocities within this acceptable uvw range",
    " that is , u , v , and w within 0 to @xmath15 , @xmath16 to @xmath17 , and @xmath18 to @xmath19  km  s@xmath13 , respectively  then it is flagged for followup investigation .    when calculating uvw velocities , we consider three estimates of proper motions : ppmxl , ucac4 , and our wise/2mass estimates .",
    "we calculate uvw based on each of these three pm lists individually and then retain only those that lie within the acceptable range of uvw for young stars . for approximately one - third of the sample the pms from all three lists yield a range of acceptable uvw ; for another third , two of the three lists yield acceptable uvw ; and for the remaining third , only one list yields some uvw entries in the acceptable uvw range . given that nearly all sources have proper motions in ppmxl , we favor ppmxl proper motions in preference to those of ucac4 and our own ( wise/2mass - based ) estimates . the uvw estimation is performed via custom idl routines , but an online javascript calculator is available to quickly calculate the potential range of uvw velocities for a single star by varying radial velocity or distance choices .",
    "we tested the robustness of this analysis with known young moving group members listed in @xcite . for objects with spectral types k5 or",
    "later , we calculated distances using our isochrones , gathered proper motion information , and calculated uvw velocities as described above .",
    "we find that 92.5% of the @xcite young moving group members are recovered .",
    "the resulting @xmath010- and @xmath0100-myr isochrone distances calculated by our methodology are within 2030% of the parallax and kinematic distances listed in @xcite .",
    "the steps described in sections  [ method : uv][uvw ] above were performed for the entire galex gr  4/5 database , resulting in a list of 32,412 sources ( use of the gr  6 database , which was released subsequent to our gr 4/5 database search , adds only 2% of new sky coverage ) .",
    "we trimmed the source list by requiring an object s uvw velocities be within the acceptable uvw box for a radial velocity range of at least 15  km / s using the @xmath010  myr isochrone distance  that is , at least @xmath010% of the full radial velocity range we tested yields uvw velocities consistent with young - star status , given the star s adopted pm and assuming an age of 10  myr .",
    "we furthermore required that these sources have @xmath010  myr distance estimates that place them within 150  pc of earth .",
    "after applying these additional constraints , we obtain a list of 2107 candidate nearby , young , low - mass stars .    despite the greater galex coverage in the northern hemisphere ( @xmath065% vs @xmath057% in the south ) ,",
    "more of our @xmath02100 galex - selected nearby , young , low - mass stars lie in the southern sky ( 58% vs 42% in the north ) .",
    "these results are consistent with a preponderance of young moving groups in the south as has been noted previously by @xcite and @xcite . given our identification of @xmath0850 northern young star candidates , the present work may lead to the identification of potential new young moving groups in the northern hemisphere .    with equation  2 , we estimate spectral types for all 2107 candidates .",
    "one surprising result is an apparent population of uv - bright sources with very late spectral types extending into the l - dwarf regime .",
    "as noted in section  [ spectypes ] and further demonstrated in section  [ specoverview ] , infrared excesses due to warm dust can produce redder j ",
    "w2 colors than expected , and thus equation  2 may misclassify dusty systems toward later spectral types . examining these late - type candidates visually and with simbad revealed that blended sources and carbon stars are also potential sources of contamination",
    ". however , the dominant contaminant for these late - type objects are galaxies .",
    "such contaminants tend to appear around ra and dec coordinates of approximately ( 280 , 30 ) and ( 100 , 30 ) degrees , corresponding to the solar apex and antapex .",
    "these regions require low proper motions and moderately large negative or positive radial velocities ( @xmath10(2040 )  km / s ) in order to match the good uvw box described in section  [ uvw ] .",
    "we have visually inspected the list of 87 potentially misclassified l - dwarfs and removed 55 galaxy contaminants and 8 blended sources .",
    "in addition , we have cross correlated against simbad and removed an additional 13 known galaxies from the full table . the final result is a table of 2031 candidate low - mass stars , with perhaps a few percent contamination from other types of objects .",
    "the distribution of spectral types is shown in figure  [ specdist ] .",
    "about half our candidates have spectral types between m3 and m4 , which is similar to the observed distribution of stars in the immediate solar neighborhood ( ie , d@xmath2020  pc ; see figure  7 in @xcite , also @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "this suggests that our list of 2031 nearby young star candidates likely includes the missing m3m5 members of nearby , young moving groups .",
    "further work will be necessary to see if any bonafide l - dwarfs or dusty m - type stars are also present in our sample .    rather than publishing the present , full list of 2031 galnyss candidates ,",
    "the vast majority of which remain unconfirmed , we have elected here to focus on a subset of this list ( section  [ tuchor ] ) , to demonstrate the basic characteristics of the objects we are identifying .",
    "the full galnyss table will be presented in a future publication .      in order to confirm that the candidates identified via the methods of sections  [ method : uv][candidates ] are in fact young low - mass stars",
    ", we must follow up with spectroscopic observations designed to exploit diagnostics of youth .",
    "candidates considered for spectroscopic followup in this and forthcoming papers are those with a broad range of radial velocities that would give uvw velocities consistent with nearby , young star status .",
    "low to medium - resolution spectroscopy can be used to confirm spectral types and identify features of youth .",
    "emission lines from hydrogen and helium can indicate stellar activity common to young stars @xcite , while the strength of na  i absorption lines can indicate low surface gravity ( @xcite ; and references therein ) and , thus , pre - main sequence star status .",
    "lithium absorption at 6708  is also a widely used diagnostic for youth .",
    "however , lithium has been shown to be rapidly depleted within @xmath010  myr or so for mid - m stars @xcite .",
    "thus the absence of li absorption only demonstrates that a mid - m star is older than @xmath010  myr . at infrared wavelengths , a triangular ( or  peaky \" ) shape to the h - band profile and weak feh , na  i , and k  i  features are all indicative of low surface gravity @xcite . with high spectral resolution",
    ", radial velocities can be measured for our candidate stars .",
    "the radial velocity can then be used to constrain the uvw velocity so as to solidify young star status and perhaps place the system among known moving groups .",
    "the tucana - horologium association ( tuc - hor ) was independently identified by @xcite and @xcite , originally as two separate nearby moving groups .",
    "@xcite later suggested that these two groups be merged into a single group located @xmath050  pc from the earth .",
    "subsequent studies ( see @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) have proposed additional stars as members of the group .",
    "@xcite list 44 bona fide members ( of a possible 67 ) with distances ranging from 3671  pc .",
    "an age of 1040  myr @xcite and @xmath030  myr @xcite has been proposed for tuc - hor members based on the strength of h@xmath3 emission , li abundance , x - ray emission , and stellar isochrones ( see also section  2.3.1 in @xcite ) . for purposes of this paper ,",
    "we have used the 44 tuc - hor members listed in @xcite and have adopted an age of @xmath030  myr and group distance of @xmath050  pc .",
    "we have applied the methods described in section  [ fvalue ] to our list of @xmath02000 galnyss - identified nearby young star candidates , and have identified a list of 58 candidates in the vicinity of tuc - hor whose kinematics are consistent with membership in this association .",
    "we note , however , that given the similarity in the uvw of members of tuc - hor and the @xmath030  myr - old columba association @xcite some of these candidates may instead be members of columba ( section  [ banyan ] ) .",
    "the large number of candidate nearby , young stars yielded by galnyss complicates searches for numerically sparse but kinematically coherent groups of candidates in specific search regions such as tuc - hor .",
    "hence , we devised a method to group together objects with similar proper motions and distance estimates .",
    "this involves the calculation of a quantity , which we call @xmath21 , for a given star among a sample of stars in some region of the sky : @xmath22 the ( @xmath23 ) terms correspond to the averages in proper motion and distance from earth of the group of stars being compared . for simplicity ,",
    "uncertainties in these terms are not folded into this expression .",
    "stars can be either members of a known group , such as the tw  hya association , or all galnyss sources in a selected area of the sky .",
    "objects within a chosen threshold f - value are retained as candidate group members and considered for followup study . for applications of the f - value analysis to an arbitrary region of the sky (",
    "i.e. , not using an already known moving group to provide the average terms ) , we perform the analysis in an iterative fashion by selecting a threshold @xmath24 and rejecting sources that have f - values larger than adopted cutoffs of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath24 , and then recomputing the average ( @xmath23 ) terms for each step using sources that were not rejected .    to validate this technique we applied the f - value analysis to members of the tw  hya association ( twa ) , to tuc - hor , and to random fields in the galnyss candidate table . for the 26 twa members listed in @xcite with measured proper motions , we find average parameters and standard deviations of ( @xmath27  mas / yr , @xmath28  mas / yr , @xmath29  pc ) and f - values ranging from above 0 up to 1.2 .",
    "the two largest f - values ( 1.1 and 1.2 ) are found for twa  12 and 31 , both of which have been considered questionable members of the twa ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining objects have f - values smaller than unity .",
    "tuc - hor , on the other hand , shows a much broader f - value distribution , with values up to 2.2 .",
    "the average terms for the members listed in @xcite are ( @xmath30  mas / yr , @xmath31  mas / yr , @xmath32  pc ) .    in contrast ,",
    "when examining random groups of galex young star candidates , we find much larger f - values ( in some cases , f@xmath0100 ) .",
    "this suggests that f - value thresholds of a few are adequate to select objects that may be members of young groups like twa and tuc - hor .",
    "we note that the f - value technique will not work efficiently in well - dispersed stellar moving groups , such as the @xmath33  pic moving group , where members possess a wide range of proper motions and distances from earth or when members lie near the location of a group s convergent point .",
    "however , it can still be applied in small regions for such groups .",
    "we applied this f - value technique to the 2031 candidate nearby young stars ( section  [ candidates ] ) to investigate the potential presence of young groups of stars at random locations across the sky .",
    "candidate groups are generated by selecting starts that lie within 2030 degrees of a chosen location and applying the iterative method described above .",
    "one of the largest groups so identified is coincident with the location of most known tuc - hor members .",
    "this group of 58 stars ( listed in table  [ table : th1 ] ) was identified considering a search radius of 30 degrees centered at ( 45 , 45 ) degrees .",
    "the mean proper motions of the stars in table  [ table : th1 ] ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 mas / yr ) match those of known tuc - hor members ( see above ) reasonably well ( figure  [ th : pm ] ) , despite our exclusion of known tuc - hor members to determine these values of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "the f - values listed in table 2 range up to 2 , similar to those of known tuc - hor members . indeed the distributions of f - values for candidates and for known members are indistinguishable from each other , as shown by a ks  test ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "in contrast , comparing the distributions of either table  [ table : th1 ] tuc - hor candidates or known tuc - hor members with that of twa members yields ks  test @xmath40= few@xmath41 , consistent with different underlying f - value distributions for twa and tuc - hor .",
    "most table  [ table : th1 ] candidates , if at the @xmath030-myr age of tuc - hor , have distances close to @xmath050  pc , in agreement with the known tuc - hor members .",
    "we stress that most of these objects are only candidates at this stage in our work .",
    "furthermore , additional tuc - hor candidates likely exist beyond the region we have searched and are not considered in this paper . in sections",
    "[ specoverview][note2 ] , we discuss properties of the table  [ table : th1 ] candidates , and in fact are able to rule out tuc - hor membership for some of them .",
    "note that , although these rejected candidates are unlikely to be tuc - hor members , they may be members of other moving groups ( e.g. , @xmath33  pic , columba , or ab dor ) and , hence , may still be young ( age @xmath42 myr ) stars .",
    "to complement the f - value analysis described in section  [ fvalue ] , we also performed a convergent point analysis on the candidate tuc - hor members .",
    "the convergent point analysis methodology has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite ; here , we have applied a simplified algorithm .",
    "this analysis consists of selecting a convergent point location and determining the proper motions ( @xmath43 ) perpendicular to the great circle connecting a star to the convergent point .",
    "the typical analysis removes suggested but discrepant members from a list until the convergent point analysis passes some threshold .",
    "we have simplified the procedure by neglecting this step ; that is , we retain potentially discrepant members while determining the location of the convergent point .",
    "this simplification , combined with the coarse , 1-degree grid we use for convergence point calculations , likely results in a convergent point that is less accurate than would be obtained for a more rigorous treatment in which outliers are rejected .",
    "however , the simplified algorithm is sufficient for the purposes of this work , namely , identifying candidate new members of moving groups .    given a convergent point location for a moving group and the perpendicular motion of a candidate group member , one can estimate a membership probability : @xmath44 the quantity @xmath45 incorporates error terms in the proper motion and convergent point location ( equation  12 in @xcite ) , while @xmath46 accounts for the internal dispersion in the group . given our coarse determination , we adopt an uncertainty of 2  degrees for the convergent point location . while the quantitative probabilities so derived may be approximate , they nevertheless present a qualitative estimate of membership probability given an object s proper motion and the estimated convergent point location of a group .",
    "we have applied this convergent point analysis to the known members of tuc - hor listed in @xcite .",
    "we determine a convergent point of ( 119 , 27 ) degrees for tuc - hor and used proper motions , distances ( both parallax and kinematic ; @xcite ) , and radial velocities @xcite to determine a mean total heliocentric space velocity magnitude of @xmath47  km / s ( table  [ cpinfo ] ) ; here the quoted error is the standard deviation of the velocities .",
    "we thus adopt an internal velocity dispersion ( @xmath46 ) of 1  km / s and , given the known member distance distribution , a group distance of 50  pc in our analysis . the group distance is used to convert the velocity dispersion in km / s to mas / yr ( with the result 4 mas / yr for tuc - hor ) .",
    "however , the convergent point location is not very sensitive to these estimates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the space velocity of known members can be combined with the angular distance between a given target star and the convergent point to estimate the radial velocity and distance the target would have if it were a member .",
    "we have created an online javascript calculator for this purpose .",
    "table  [ cpinfo ] lists convergent point information for various groups determined via the method described above .",
    "these can be used as inputs for our javascript tool .",
    "the kinematic distance and radial velocity estimates for the 58 tuc - hor candidates ( table  [ table : th1 ] ) are tabulated , along with the probabilities described here , in table  [ table : th2 ] . in figure",
    "[ th : cmd ] , we use our kinematic distances to construct a color - magnitude diagram for the candidate tuc - hor stars .",
    "the tuc - hor low - mass candidates lie above the ic2391 members in the color - magnitude diagram , suggesting the tuc - hor candidates have ages @xmath150 myr , consistent with the age of tuc - hor as inferred from prior studies ( see section  [ tuchor ] ) .",
    "a pair of theoretical 30  myr - old isochrones are also shown @xcite ; the agreement is marginally better with the @xcite isochrones for the tuc - hor candidates .",
    "when compared to the absolute magnitudes of field population m - dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we find that our candidates , when located at the kinematic distances we estimate , are all over - luminous , as expected for young systems .",
    "to investigate the nature of the tuc - hor candidates , we used the wifes spectrograph at the siding springs observatory 2.3-m telescope to observe some of these systems at resolution @xmath03000 or @xmath07000 .",
    "wifes @xcite is a double - beam , image - slicing integral field spectrograph , and provides a 25@xmath4838 field with 0.5pixels .",
    "observations over the spectral range 32009800 were carried out in 2012  september and october .",
    "figure  [ wifes ] shows the spectra , covering the h@xmath3 and li region , for stars observed thus far .",
    "initial analysis has focused on measurements of h@xmath3 emission , lithium absorption at 6707 , and sodium absorption at 8200 . to derive accurate spectral types we computed the tio5 index as described in @xcite .",
    "we list our measurements in table  [ meas1 ] , including a handful of cases in which published spectroscopy exists in the literature .",
    "figure  [ sptype ] compares the spectral types initially estimated with j ",
    "w2 colors to those derived from the tio5 index ( accurate to @xmath100.5 ) for tuc - hor candidates and young low - mass candidates from @xcite .",
    "there is evidently sufficiently good agreement between these spectral type estimation methods that a disagreement  in the sense that j ",
    "w2 is too red  likely indates the presence of emission from warm dust grains .",
    "such appears the case for j021556 , j025942 , and j032427 ( see figure  [ sptype ] ) .",
    "we note that at an age of @xmath030  myr , brown dwarfs are expected to have spectral types later than @xmath0m6 @xcite .",
    "in addition to optical spectra , near - infrared spectra for j020231 , j025942 , and j032427 were obtained with the spex spectrograph @xcite on the 3-m nasa irtf .",
    "observations were carried out on 2012 december 25 and 2013 january 1 ( ut ) with the spectrograph in prism mode with the 0.5 or 0.8@xmath49 slit , resulting in @xmath50 100 over the wavelength range 0.72.5@xmath4 m ( figure  [ th_irtf ] ) .",
    "observations were carried out with an abba dither pattern along the slit , with exposure times determined by the target magnitudes .",
    "a0v stars observed immediately after each target were used as standards for flux calibration and telluric correction .",
    "all data were reduced with spextool version 3.3 @xcite and standard settings .    at the irtf , we resolved j020231 as a @xmath00.5@xmath49 binary ; while guiding , the slit switched between both stars .",
    "comparison with field dwarf standards shows the spectrum of the pair to be an m4 type , in agreement with the spectral type determined from the optical spectrum  which did not resolve the system  suggesting j020231 is an equal mass binary .",
    "the spex spectrum of j025942 , which displays a very red j ",
    "w2 color , indicates a spectral type of m5 , also in agreement with the optical spectrum .",
    "we do not have an optical spectrum for j032427 , but its spex spectrum indicates it is an m5.5 , rather than an m9 as indicated by the j ",
    "as we discuss in appendix  [ notesys ] , both j025942 and j032427 have wise infrared excesses that indicate the presence of circumstellar disks .",
    "both show br-@xmath51 emission and weak na  i absorption , which may indicate youth . however , other features , such as the lack of li absorption in the optical and the shape of the h - band profile ( see section  [ specfollowup ] ) , are inconclusive .",
    "j020231 does not show any clear signatures of youth in its near - ir spectrum .",
    "equivalent widths of h@xmath3 emission and li absorption for some of the tuc - hor candidates are listed in table  [ meas1 ] .",
    "uncertainties for the equivalent width measurements are computed by using the rms scatter from a linear fit to the continuum around each line and propagating this with a monte carlo method . for non - detections , we quote only the 1-@xmath52 uncertainties . with the exception of j031553 , no table  [ meas1 ] star observed with wifes shows clear li absorption at 6708 .",
    "this is not surprising as , at the expected @xmath030  myr age of these candidates , lithium should have been depleted for early to mid m - type stars ( see section  [ specfollowup ] ) .",
    "j031553 is therefore a noteworthy exception as it has a spectral type near m5 and li absorption ew of @xmath0400m .",
    "one possibility is that j031553 is a member of the @xmath010  myr @xmath33  pictoris moving group . to investigate this possibility",
    ", we carried out a convergent point analysis using @xmath33  pic members in a similar fashion to those of tuc - hor ( section  [ cpanalysis ] ) .",
    "however , with our estimated convergent point for the @xmath33  pic moving group ( table  [ cpinfo ] ) , we find a probability of only 6% that j031553 is a member of @xmath33  pictoris ( similar to the 0.3% probability returned by the bayesian analysis of @xcite ) .",
    "hence , while the lithium absorption ew may suggest an age comparable to the @xmath33  pic moving group , j031553 s kinematics nevertheless suggest it is a strong candidate for membership in tuc - hor .",
    "a handful of table  [ table : th1 ] systems have published spectroscopy available in @xcite or @xcite , including j023652 , another system with clear li absorption . j031553 and j023652 , among other systems ,",
    "are considered in more detail in appendix  [ notesys ] .",
    "all table  [ meas1 ] stars show h@xmath3 emission .",
    "however , this is not necessarily indicative of youth , as h@xmath3 activity can still be seen among old m - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "@xcite predict activity lifetimes of order @xmath01  gyr for m2 stars and @xmath06  gyr for m6 stars .",
    "in fact , m5m9 stars in the field are commonly seen to show h@xmath3 activity , with the latest types nearly always showing activity regardless of age @xcite . to attempt to determine whether our h@xmath3 detections are indicative of ages @xmath11  gyr ,",
    "we make a comparison between our sample and the older sample studied in @xcite .",
    "we compute log @xmath53 for table 5 stars as described in @xcite .",
    "results are illustrated in figure  [ halpha ] along with the average @xmath53 from @xcite .",
    "we find that most of the table  [ meas1 ] sample have larger @xmath53 than the field population .",
    "this suggests that the table  [ meas1 ] stars are statistically younger than the field population studied in @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising given that we have selected these candidate tuc - hor m - dwarfs based on uv emission from galex which likely originates from the active chromospheres of young stars ( see introduction ) .",
    "several recent studies have shown that na  i absorption can be used as a diagnostic of stellar surface gravity and thus of youth @xcite . in particular ,",
    "young objects are expected to have lower surface gravities and hence weaker na  i absorption .",
    "the spectral feature used in these studies is the na  i doublet at 8183 and 8195 ( see figure  [ naspec ] ) . @xcite",
    "construct an index based on the average flux off and on the doublet ( @xmath54 ) , whereas @xcite use the ew summed over both lines .",
    "we measured both of these quantities for the tuc - hor candidates for which we obtained wifes spectra and list them in table  [ meas1 ] .",
    "the na  i index is measured in spectra that have been re - binned to a resolution of r@xmath0800 , to match that used in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ naindex ] compares the na  i index with spectral type for table  [ meas1 ] stars .",
    "young low - mass candidates from the @xcite study of twa and scorpius - centaurus regions are also shown .",
    "empirically determined trends for nearby @xmath010 myr old moving groups and ( old ) field dwarfs are also presented @xcite , where we have used the relations in @xcite to convert the @xcite r ",
    "i colors to spectral type .",
    "the tuc - hor candidates have higher na  i indices than the young ( ages @xmath01020  myr ) candidates from @xcite , consistent with the older ages expected for tuc - hor members . while some tuc - hor candidates are close to the field dwarf line , these tend to lie in a region where the na  i index for young and old stars start to converge ( ie , spectral types earlier than about m4 ) .",
    "the na  i 8200 doublet is therefore only useful as an age indicator for stars later than @xmath0m4 , as also demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ naindex ] indicates that most of the tuc - hor candidates lie in a region suggestive of an age older than @xmath010  myr , but younger than @xmath01  gyr .      of the 58 tuc - hor candidates ,",

    "figure  [ fig : xray1 ] and table  [ xray2 ] indicate that the frequency of rass x - ray detections strongly depends on spectral type , i.e. , the rass detection frequency drops for stars m4 and later .",
    "the low rate of x - ray detections among our sample indicates that galex observations are capable of detecting active late m - dwarfs that have been missed in the rass .",
    "@xcite published a bayesian analysis tool ( banyan ) to estimate membership probabilities , distances , and radial velocities for candidates of known local young moving groups .",
    "the output is thus similar to that returned by the convergent point method employed here ( section  [ cpanalysis ] ) and serves as a useful comparison . in table",

    ", we adopt a conservative uncertainty of @xmath020% for our kinematic distances .",
    "there are several cases where we find a high likelihood of tuc - hor membership with our convergent point analysis , but banyan returns a very low probability . in many of these cases ,",
    "banyan returns a higher likelihood for membership in a different group .",
    "furthermore , we find that for those objects with low banyan tuc - hor likelihoods , we predict much larger distances ( @xmath060120  pc ) than the average tuc - hor member distances ( most of which lie in the range 4060  pc ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : xyz ] shows the xyz coordinates of the table  [ table : th1 ] candidates , adopting our kinematic distance estimates , and compares these xyz values to those of known tuc - hor members from @xcite . while most candidates have similar xyz to those of known members , there are some prominent outliers ( see appendix  [ notesys ] ) . for these outliers , banyan returns low likelihoods for membership in tuc - hor . hence , the combination of probability and predicted distance in our convergent point analysis is analogous to the probability returned by the banyan code .      among table  [ table :",
    "th1 ] stars , there are several systems that are noteworthy for one or more reasons .",
    "for example , two systems ( j025942 and j032427 ) have clear signs of an infrared excess , as first noted in section  [ thspex1 ] ( see also figure  [ fig : sed ] ) , while another system , j024253ew , constitutes a wide separation low - mass binary .",
    "other systems have been previously mentioned in the literature ; for some systems , we have now measured radial velocities . for systems with radial velocities",
    "we calculate uvw velocities and list them in table  [ tab : uvw ] .",
    "some table  [ table : th1 ] stars appear to have low likelihoods ( @xmath6160% ) of tuc - hor membership using the convergent point analysis or the bayesian methodology of @xcite , but have higher likelihoods for membership in other groups .",
    "these noteworthy stars are discussed individually in appendix  [ notesys ] .",
    "candidates that remain plausible members of moving groups ( after the discussion in appendix  [ notesys ] ) are summarized in table  [ tab : final ] , but we caution that measurements of radial velocities and distances will be necessary to fully confirm or rule out membership .",
    "we have carried out an all - sky galex - wise-2mass search for nearby ( d@xmath61100 pc ) , young ( age 10100 myr ) , low - mass ( mostly m - type ) stars .",
    "we refer to this search as the galex nearby young - star survey , or galnyss . on the basis of their uv / ir colors and space motions , where the latter are inferred from proper motions and photometry",
    ", we identify 2031 candidate nearby , young m stars .",
    "the spectral type distribution of these candidates peaks near m3-m4 .",
    "most prior searches for young stars in nearby moving groups have focused on bright stars or on those with x - ray emission .",
    "hence , these searches have tended to lack the sensitivity to detect the mid - m stars that dominate the list of nearby , young star candidates we have identified via galnyss .",
    "given that m3m5 stars constitute about half of all stars in the solar neighborhood , our survey thereby helps fill an important niche in the study of nearby young moving groups .",
    "we consider a subset of 58 low - mass stars among the larger galnyss sample that lie in the vicinity of previously proposed members of the tucana - horologium asssociation .",
    "we have developed and applied a grouping algorithm to select these stars , and we further confirm them as a kinematically coherent group via convergent point and bayesian analyses @xcite .",
    "optical and near - ir spectroscopy obtained for some of the subsample of 58 tuc - hor candidates appear to confirm their young ages ( @xmath030100 myr ) , based on their h emission lines and li and na  i absorption line strengths .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram positions of the candidate tuc - hor members ( as inferred from their kinematic distances ) relative to those of low - mass ic2391 members also indicate that the candidates are likely younger than @xmath050 myr .",
    "only roughly 1/3 of the sample objects are detected in the rosat all - sky x - ray survey , indicating that galex is capable of identifying young stars that are too faint to have been detected in the most sensitive extant all - sky x - ray survey .",
    "we find that half of the 58 candidates have kinematic and spectroscopic properties consistent with membership in tuc - hor ( table  [ tab : final ] ) .",
    "many of the other candidates may instead members of other young groups .",
    "specifically , two stars are potential members of the ab dor moving group , while 12 may be new columba association members .",
    "two of the columba candidates have infrared excesses indicating the presence of warm circumstellar disks in these systems .",
    "while the 15 remaining stars among the group of 58 do not have kinematics that might place them among the known young moving groups , their uv excesses suggest they nevertheless could be young ; these stars warrant further examination .",
    "radial velocity measurements of these 58 candidate young , low - mass stars will be required to further confirm membership in tuc - hor or in other young moving groups . in subsequent work",
