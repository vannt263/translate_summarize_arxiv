    "the donaldson - thomas ( dt ) invariants enumerate semistable coherent sheaves on calabi - yau 3-folds , which have drawn much attention recently  @xcite .",
    "we are in interested in the following two problems in dt theory :    * find constraints among dt invariants induced by autoequivalences of the derived category of coherent sheaves , e.g. seidel - thomas twists  @xcite . *",
    "construct dt type invariants counting b - branes on landau - ginzburg ( lg ) models associated to a superpotential .",
    "as for the former problem , there are several predictions in string theory on generating series of dt invariants , e.g. @xmath1-duality conjecture , ooguri - strominger - vafa conjecture  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "there seem to be mysterious constraints among dt invariants behind such predictions , and we hope to reveal their origins via symmetries in the derived category . we believe that a key step toward this problem is to construct a bridgeland stability condition on the derived category  @xcite satisfying a certain symmetric property with respect to the given autoequivalence . indeed a construction of a ( weak ) stability condition which is preserved under the derived dual , together with wall - crossing arguments  @xcite ,  @xcite , play crucial roles in the proof of the rationality of the generating series of rank one dt type invariants counting curves  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite .    as for the latter problem , in order to define the dt type invariants , we need to fix a stability condition for b - branes on lg models",
    ". a desired stability condition should be natural in some sense , so that it is an analogue of gieseker stability on coherent sheaves . in a mathematical term ,",
    "if the superpotential is given by a homogeneous polynomial @xmath2 , the relevant b - brane category is orlov s triangulated category of graded matrix factorizations @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath2 is the defining polynomial of a quintic calabi - yau 3-fold @xmath4 .",
    "then a desired bridgeland stability condition on @xmath3 may correspond to the gepner point ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : one ] ) of the stringy k@xmath0hler moduli space of @xmath5 , via mirror symmetry and orlov equivalence  @xcite @xmath6 the gepner point is an orbifold point in the stringy k@xmath0hler moduli space of @xmath5 , with the stabilizer group @xmath7 .",
    "such an orbifold data may be translated into a certain symmetric property of the corresponding bridgeland stability condition , which we focus and pursue in this paper .",
    "now we have observed a common keyword regarding the above two problems , that is _ a bridgeland stability condition with a symmetric property_. the motivating problem of this paper , which is rather ambitious and not able to do at this moment , is to find a natural stability condition on @xmath3 , and apply its symmetric property to obtain non - trivial constraints among dt invariants on @xmath5 , via orlov equivalence ( [ intro : orlov ] ) and wall - crossing arguments  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "subsection  [ subsec : future ] ( iii ) . )    hler moduli space of a quintic 3-fold , width=226 ]      as we discussed , we are interested in constructing a natural stability condition on @xmath3 .",
    "so far there are few works on this problem , except  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , which will be discussed later .",
    "a serious issue is that , since the category @xmath3 is _ not _ a priori constructed as a derived category of some abelian category , it is not clear what is the meaning of ` natural ' .",
    "our viewpoint is as follows : rather than constructing a stability condition in terms of graded matrix factorizations , we just extract and formulate the symmetric property of a desired stability condition , and try to find a one satisfying such a property .",
    "we formulate it as a _ gepner type _ property , which depends on a choice of a pair of an autoequivalence and a complex number , given simply as follows :    a stability condition @xmath8 on a triangulated category @xmath9 is called gepner type with respect to @xmath10 if the following condition holds : @xmath11    obviously any stability condition is gepner type with respect to @xmath12 , k)$ ] for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 $ ] is the @xmath15-times composition of the shift functor @xmath16 $ ] . on the other hand ,",
    "there are several interesting examples in which the relation ( [ intro : eq : gep ] ) holds with respect to non - trivial pairs @xmath17 .",
    "as the name indicates , if @xmath4 is a quintic 3-fold , a gepner type stability condition on @xmath18 with respect to the pair @xmath19 conjecturally corresponds to the gepner point , where @xmath20 is the seidel - thomas twist  @xcite associated to @xmath21 .",
    "the fraction @xmath22 appears since the five times composition of the autoequivalence @xmath23 becomes the twice shift functor .",
    "this fact is best understood in terms of @xmath3 via the equivalence ( [ intro : orlov ] ) , as the autoequivalence @xmath23 corresponds to the grade shift functor on the matrix factorization side .    at this moment",
    ", it seems to be a difficult problem to construct a stability condition on a quintic 3-fold corresponding to the gepner point : we are not even able to construct a bridgeland stability condition on a quintic 3-fold near the large volume limit point .",
    "however there is a plenty of examples of weighted homogeneous polynomials , which are more amenable than quintic polynomials , but enough interesting to study .",
    "the goal of this paper is to construct gepner type stability conditions on graded matrix factorizations in some of such interesting cases . in the quintic case ,",
    "an attempt to construct a gepner point leads to a conjectural stronger version of bogomolov - gieseker inequality among chern characters of stable sheaves on quintic 3-folds .",
    "the detail in this case will be discussed in a subsequent paper  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 be a homogeneous element with degree @xmath24 in the weighted polynomial ring @xmath25 , \\quad \\deg x_i = a_i \\in \\mathbb{z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] such that @xmath26 has only an isolated singularity at the origin .",
    "the triangulated category of graded matrix factorizations of @xmath2 , denoted by @xmath27 , is defined to be the homotopy category of the dg category whose objects consist of data @xmath28 where @xmath29 are graded free @xmath30-modules of finite rank , @xmath31 are homomorphisms of graded @xmath30-modules , @xmath32 is the shift of the grading , satisfying the following condition : @xmath33 in  @xcite , orlov proved that the triangulated category @xmath27 is related to the derived category of coherent sheaves on the stack @xmath34 depending on the sign of the gorenstein index @xmath35 let @xmath36 be the autoequivalence of @xmath3 induced by the grade shift functor @xmath37 .",
    "we propose the following conjecture on the existence of a gepner type stability condition on @xmath27 :    [ conj : gep ] there is a gepner type stability condition @xmath38 with respect to @xmath39 , whose central charge @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 here the @xmath42-action on @xmath43 is induced by the @xmath44-grading on each @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the supertrace which respects the @xmath47-grading on @xmath43 .",
    "similarly to the quintic case , the fraction @xmath48 appears since the @xmath24-times composition of @xmath36 coincides with @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "we propose that , if there is a desired stability condition @xmath50 in conjecture  [ conj : gep ] , then it may be employed as a ` natural ' stability condition for graded matrix factorizations .",
    "there are at least three reasons for this .",
    "firstly the gepner type property with respect to @xmath39 resembles the following property of the classical gieseker stability on coherent sheaves : for a polarized variety @xmath51 , a coherent sheaf @xmath52 on @xmath5 is @xmath53-gieseker semistable if and only if @xmath54 is @xmath53-gieseker semistable . in this sense",
    ", the desired stability condition @xmath50 seems to be a natural analogue of the gieseker stability on @xmath55 for graded matrix factorizations .",
    "secondly , the gepner type property with respect to @xmath39 turns out to be a very strong constraint for the stability conditions .",
    "indeed , such a property characterizes the central charge @xmath40 uniquely up to a scalar multiplication .",
    "subsection  [ subsec : unique1 ] . ) also in some cases , we see that @xmath50 is also unique up to shift ( cf .",
    "subsection  [ subsec : unique2 ] ) and one may expect that this holds in general .",
    "thirdly , if there is such @xmath50 , then the @xmath50-semistable objects have a nice compatibility with the serre functor on @xmath3 . as a result",
    ", the moduli space of @xmath50-semistable objects should have good local properties , e.g. smoothness , with a perfect obstruction theory , etc , depending on the given data @xmath56 .",
    "subsection  [ subsec : future ] ( ii ) . ) therefore , whatever the way @xmath50 is constructed , it seems worth studying moduli spaces of @xmath50-semistable objects , and the enumerative invariants defined by them .      before stating our result , we mention the previous beautiful works by takahashi  @xcite and kajiura - saito - takahashi  @xcite .",
    "they study the triangulated category @xmath3 in the following cases : @xmath57  @xcite and @xmath58 , @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "in these cases , they show that @xmath3 is equivalent to the derived category of representations of a quiver of ade type . as a result , @xmath3 has only a finite number of indecomposable objects up to shift , which are completely classified .",
    "using such a classification , they construct a stability condition on @xmath3 by the assignment of a phase for each indecomposable object .",
    "their construction satisfies our gepner type property , so conjecture  [ conj : gep ] is proved in these cases .",
    "subsection  [ subsec : rmk : n=3 ] . )    from our motivation , we are rather interested in a case that there is an infinite number of indecomposable objects up to shift , which are hard to classify , and form non - trivial moduli spaces .",
    "for instance if @xmath60 , then the stack ( [ w=0 ] ) is either calabi - yau or general type , and it seems hopeless to construct @xmath50 via classification of indecomposable objects .",
    "our main result , formulated as follows , contains such cases : ( cf .",
    "propositions  [ prop:30 ] , [ prop:2 - 1 ] , [ prop:40 ] , [ prop:3 - 1 ] , [ prop:2 - 2 ] . )    [ thm : main ] conjecture  [ conj : gep ] is true if @xmath61 and the stack @xmath5 defined by ( [ w=0 ] ) does not contain stacky points .",
    "the assumption that @xmath5 does not contain stacky points means that @xmath5 is indeed a smooth projective variety .",
    "the inequality @xmath61 implies that @xmath5 is contained in a calabi - yau manifold of dimension less than or equal to two as a codimension @xmath62 complete intersection of hyperplanes .",
    "these conditions are restrictive , and the possible types @xmath63 are completely classified . the classification with @xmath64 and @xmath2 of fermat type",
    "is given in table  1 below .",
    "[ table ]    .possible types in theorem  [ thm : main ] [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     our strategy proving theorem  [ thm : main ] is as follows : by orlov s theorem  @xcite , the condition @xmath60 allows us to describe @xmath3 as a semiorthogonal decomposition @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a fully faithful functor from @xmath18 to @xmath3 , and @xmath67 is a certain exceptional object . we show that there is the heart of a bounded t - structure on @xmath3 , given by the extension closure @xmath68 we describe the central charge @xmath40 in terms of the generators of the heart @xmath69 , and take a suitable tilting @xmath70 of @xmath69 using the description of @xmath40 .",
    "we then show that the pair @xmath71 determines a stability condition @xmath50 on @xmath3 .",
    "it remains to show that @xmath50 has a desired gepner type property , and we reduce it to showing @xmath50-stability of certain objects in @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the above construction works in the situation of theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "however unfortunately , several case by case arguments are involved in the proof , and that prevents us to construct @xmath50 beyond the cases in theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "for instance , they contain the proofs of the inequalities of numerical classes of certain objects in @xmath69 , which are required in proving the axiom of bridgeland stability for @xmath71 .",
    "they also contain checking the @xmath50-stability of some objects in @xmath3 , which we use to prove the gepner type property of @xmath50 .",
    "the above arguments are in particular hard if the image of @xmath40 is not discrete .",
    "in the situation of theorem  [ thm : main ] , fortunately , the image of @xmath40 is always discrete and that makes our situation technically rather amenable .",
    "for instance the image of @xmath40 is not discrete if @xmath72 , and the case of @xmath73 is not included in table  1 .",
    "such a case will be discussed in a subsequent paper  @xcite , since it involves a subtle argument due to the above non - discrete issue .    among the list in table  1 ,",
    "the case of @xmath74 seems to be the most interesting case , since we observe a new phenomenon relating graded matrix factorizations and coherent systems on the smooth projective curve @xmath5 .",
    "recall that a coherent system on @xmath5 consists of data @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a coherent sheaf on @xmath5 and @xmath77 is a finite dimensional @xmath78-vector space .",
    "we show that the heart @xmath69 is equivalent to the abelian category of coherent systems on @xmath5 . in the construction of @xmath50",
    ", we see that a clifford type bound on the dimension of @xmath77 is involved .",
    "such a clifford type bound for semistable coherent systems is established by lange - newstead  @xcite , and we apply their work .",
    "if @xmath5 has a higher dimension , the conjectural construction of @xmath50 would predict a higher dimensional analogue of clifford type bound for semistable coherent systems . in the case of a quintic surface",
    ", the detail will be discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we believe that the work of this paper leads to several interesting directions of the future research .",
    "we discuss some of them .",
    "* ( i ) descriptions of @xmath50-semistable objects in terms of graded matrix factorizations : * as we discussed in the previous subsection , our construction of @xmath50 relies on orlov s theorem , and it is not intrinsic in terms of graded matrix factorizations .",
    "it would be an interesting problem to see what kinds of graded matrix factorizations appear as @xmath50-semistable objects , and compare them with the @xmath79-stability discussed in string theory  @xcite .",
    "it may involve deeper understanding of orlov equivalence , and we are not even able to give a mathematically rigorous candidate of the description of @xmath50 purely in terms of graded matrix factorizations .    * ( ii ) constructing moduli spaces of @xmath50-semistable graded matrix factorizations : * it would be an important problem to construct moduli spaces of @xmath50-semistable graded matrix factorizations , and study their properties .",
    "we expect that , using the argument of  @xcite , there exist artin stacks of finite type @xmath80 which parameterize @xmath50-(semi)stable graded matrix factorizations @xmath43 with @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 is the zero - th hochschild homology group of @xmath3 , studied in  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite . on the other hand",

    "since the space @xmath85 is responsible for the local deformation theory of @xmath43 , the moduli space @xmath86 would have good local properties depending on @xmath56 , e.g. it is smooth if @xmath87 , has a perfect obstruction theory if @xmath88 .",
