    "the physics of sheath in plasmas is an intriguing subject in fundamental plasma physics and has been widely studied .",
    "nevertheless , by no means the study can be considered to be complete .",
    "the basic reason behind this is the hugely varied categories of space and laboratory plasmas with disparate physical conditions , where plasma sheaths form .",
    "these phenomena range from basic laboratory plasmas ( gas discharge devices)@xcite to fusion plasma devices ( viz .",
    "tokamaks)@xcite and from ionospheric plasmas in planetary atmospheres@xcite to astrophysical plasmas such as planetary nebulae@xcite .",
    "the plasma solitons can also be considered as close cousins of stationary plasma sheaths , which occur in laboratory as well as space plasmas and can be considered as _ moving sheaths@xcite _ in a plasma .",
    "insight into sheath dynamics requires the poisson s equation to be solved with certain assumptions for the ion and electron densities and only if the relevant parameters are known .",
    "tonks and langmuir@xcite were among the firsts to be able to reduce the complete sheath equation to a simpler integral equation .",
    "their solution gives the potential distribution within the plasma .",
    "auer@xcite , caruso and cavaliere@xcite , and self@xcite have analyzed the phenomena to find out the potential distribution solution throughout the plasma and in the sheath region .",
    "it was riemann@xcite , who presented a review regarding the sheath formation and the basic features of sheath and its relation to bohm sheath criterion .",
    "as the study of plasma sheath has gained attention due to its practical importance , researchers have been able to establish a very good correlation between the theory and the experiment@xcite .",
    "though by plasmas we usually mean electron - ion plasmas , practically they are never so pure and always have contaminations in the form of dust . in extreme cases ,",
    "these become dusty plasmas . in almost all plasma sheaths , which usually form due to plasma - wall interactions",
    ", some kind of impurities do intrude into the sheath .",
    "we in this work , have studied such a phenomena which we refer to as _ dust in plasma sheath_. as we know , dust particles are abundant in all kinds of plasmas and they modify the plasma dynamics by being constituent plasma component which happens as electrons ( usually ) settle down on the dust surfaces due to their large electrical capacitance . in most cases ,",
    "the charging of the dust particles is treated in collisionless plasma physics , theoretically with the well known orbit motion limited ( oml ) theory@xcite . as the dust particles are considerably heavier @xmath0",
    ", their dynamical time scale is quite larger than the slowest electron - ion time scale i.e.  ion - acoustic time scale .",
    "however they do affect the ion - acoustic dynamics by creating a charge imbalance in the electron - ion population .",
    "usually this is through electron depletion , although one can fabricate different physical scenarios in laboratory plasmas@xcite , where positively charged dust particles are present .    among different space plasma environments ,",
    "the moon provides a convenient natural laboratory to study plasma - wall interactions in the space environment . from various satellite observations , we now know that a thin layer of dust @xmath1 exists around the lunar surface@xcite .",
    "lunar prospector ( lp ) and apollo - era missions gave the first hint that there must be a complex and coupled system of plasmas and dust over the moon s surface@xcite .",
    "the ambient plasma and solar ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation incident on the lunar surface are the main causes that the surface of the moon becomes electrically charged . on the dayside , photoemission typically dominates and the lunar surface charges to a positive potential , while on the nightside the plasma electrons usually dominate and the surface of the moon charges to a negative potential@xcite . as the lunar surface ( and other bodies without any protective environments )",
    "is exposed to solar uv radiation , cosmic rays , and constant bombardment by interplanetary bodies , a plasma sheath forms immediately above the lunar surface into which dust particles are injected from the regolith .",
    "this provides a very natural environment to study the complex plasma sheath dynamics .    in this work ,",
    "we have revisited the phenomena of plasma sheath with a considerable presence of dust particles . in the ion - acoustic time - scale , the the dust dynamics can be neglected and the dust particles are considered to be stationary .",
    "the dust particles affect the sheath dynamics by affecting the plasma potential .",
    "we have self - consistently considered the dust - effects in the poisson equation , which is then solved to obtain the plasma and dust potentials .",
    "as we consider a stationary sheath , we consider the current to the dust particles to be balanced throughout the formation of the plasma sheath . as a result ,",
    "different currents to the surface of a dust particle become dependent on the grain potential , which is a function of the particle size .",
    "the resultant steady - state model is a 4-dimensional differential model , which we have reduced to a one - dimensional integro - differential model , owing to the integrability of the ion continuity and ion momentum equations .",
    "our results show that the dust - effect in the poisson equation considerably changes the structure of the dust layer , which might form as a result of levitation due to oppositely directed electrostatic and gravitational forces . as a probable application",
    ", we have used parameters for lunar plasma environment , though the results obtained in this work could be used in other plasma - wall interactions as well , with appropriate parameters . in sec.ii",
    ", we consider our plasma model . in sec.iii",
    ", we develop the sheath model . in sec.iv , we consider the dust - effects on the plasma sheath . in sec.v , we consider contributions of various forces on a dust particle inside a plasma sheath .",
    "finally , in sec.vi , we summarise our results .",
    "our basic equations are due to a collisionless electron - ion plasma with a considerable presence of dust grains .",
    "the equations ( in 1-d ) are ion continuity and momentum equations and electrons are assumed to be boltzmannian owing to their negligible mass , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the plasma potential and the temperature is expressed in energy unit .",
    "we use the ion equation of state as , @xmath4 the model is closed by the poisson equation , @xmath5 all the symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "note that the presence of dust grains are incorporated into the model through the poisson equation .",
    "the number of charge that resides on the surface of a dust grain is a function of the grain potential @xmath6 .",
    "we have chosen to normalize the plasma potential with @xmath7 , length with debye length @xmath8 , velocity with ion - thermal velocity @xmath9 , time with @xmath10 , electron , ion , and dust densities with the respective equilibrium densities @xmath11 , and ion pressure @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",

    "the top panel on the left is for @xmath49 and @xmath180 and on the right is for @xmath181 ( equal ion and electron temperature ) .",
    "the blue curves on both panels are for @xmath96 and the orange curves are for @xmath182 signifying @xmath183 depletion of electron on the surface of dust particles .",
    "the lower panels correspond to the respective parameters of the top panels but show the locus of the point where the net force @xmath169 in the @xmath79-@xmath65 plane . from this figure",
    ", the effect of higher dust concentration in the plasma sheath can be clearly seen . for both low and high mach numbers ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath149 with @xmath79 , remains almost same when the dust effect is not considered . for lower mach numbers ( left panes ) , hot ions",
    "@xmath184 causes the sheath to expand which pushes the dust particles away from the wall which is well understood .",
    "however for high mach numbers ( right panels ) , increase of dust particles inside the sheath prevents this push and they tend to settle down closer to the wall , even when the ions are now as hot as the electrons @xmath185 .",
    "variation of @xmath186 with @xmath20 for cold and warm sheath with and without dust effects .",
    "all parameters are same as in earlier figures.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    levitation of dust particles in the sheath is due to the balance of the electrostatic force and the force due to gravity .",
    "heavier dust particles always settle down on the wall irrespective of the repulsive electrostatic force on them which gives rise to a minimum size @xmath186 , for the dust particles for levitation .",
    "this can be calculated by following the locus of the maxima of the the net force @xmath187 as a function of @xmath79 in the @xmath79-@xmath65 plane . from eq.([eq : total_force ] ) , the maximum of @xmath187 is given by , @xmath188 which translates to the condition , @xmath189 where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "the above equation can be solved for @xmath79 resulting @xmath190 such that @xmath191 .",
    "we then need to solve the equation @xmath192 for @xmath65 , which determines @xmath186 . in fig.[fig : rmin ] , we have shown the numerically calculated @xmath186 as a function of the mach number .",
    "though more number of dust particles in the sheath restricts the size of dust particles nearer the wall , it nevertheless pushes up the minimum size of the dust particles , which can be levitated in the sheath . as a result , due to the dust effecting the plasma potential inside the sheath region",
    ", we can expect a significant reduction of the distance away from the wall up to which we have dust levitation , but the levitated dust particles should now have an extended distribution of size as @xmath186 increases .",
    "in this work , we have considered the formation of warm plasma sheath in the vicinity of a wall in an environment with a considerable presence of dust particles . as an example , we have used the parameters relevant in case of lunar plasma sheath , though the results obtained in this work could be applied to any other physical situation such as laboratory plasma . in the ion - acoustic time scale , we have neglected the dust dynamics and thus the dust particle provides a stationary background to the electron - ion plasma .",
    "however , the dust particles do affect the sheath dynamics by affecting the poisson equation which determines the plasma potential in the sheath region .",
    "we have assumed that the current to a dust particle remains balanced throughout the sheath formation process .",
    "this makes the grain potential dependent on plasma potential , which is then incorporated into the poisson equation .",
    "the resultant numerical model becomes an initial value problem , which is described by a 1-d integro - differential equation , which is then solved self - consistently by incorporating the change in plasma potential caused by inclusion of the dust potential in the poisson equation .",
    "the initial value is given by the plasma potential at the wall determined by the mach number ( equilibrium ion thermal velocity ) .",
    "we have shown that the presence of massive dust particles inside the sheath region considerably affects the plasma sheath . as dust particles",
    "are introduced into the sheath , which may happen naturally in case of space plasma environments and through plasma - wall interactions in laboratory plasmas , they becomes sources of huge collection of negative charges ( in this case ) requiring more number of ions to neutralise the negative charges while the wall potential remain same . as a result ,",
    "the sheath becomes thicker .",
    "the warm ions helps this process of thickening much like a debye shielding expanding due to temperature .",
    "we have also considered the phenomenon of levitation of dust particles inside the plasma sheath , which happens due to counteracting electrostatic force and force due to gravity ( assuming gravity to be acting perpendicularly downward tom the sheath ) .",
    "though there may be many other sources of force on a dust particle , they can be neglected in most cases .",
    "bigger dust particles acquire more charges on their surfaces though at the same time get heavier . as a result",
    "they may get levitated inside the sheath although the levitation distance ( as measured in terms of distance from the wall ) may differ depending on the constituent of dust particles",
    ". for low mach numbers , hot ions causes the sheath to expand which pushes the dust particles away from the wall .",
    "this effect is like the expansion of debye shielding cloud expanding due to temperature . for high mach numbers , however ,",
    "increase of dust particles inside the sheath prevents this push and they tend to settle down closer to the wall , even when the ions are as hot as electrons .",
    "heavier dust particles always settle down on the wall , which gives rise to a minimum dust size which is required for levitation . increasing dust density in the plasma sheath",
    "restricts the size of levitating dust particles nearer the wall .",
    "however , on the average , it pushes up the minimum levitation size . as a result , while due to the effect of dust potential affecting the floating plasma potential in the sheath causes a significant reduction of the levitation distance , the dust distribution becomes broader .    in summary ,",
    "our analysis provides a generic framework for dust in plasma sheath which could be paramerized to suit laboratory experiments as well as different space and astrophysical environments . to analyse the detailed distribution of levitating dust particles in a plasma sheath in a particular physical scenario , we need to input the respective physical parameters into our analysis .",
    "the levitating dust particles in plasma sheath may very well affect results of various plasma processing experiments and the knowledge of detailed dust distribution in plasma sheath is desired to tailor particular needs of experiments ."
