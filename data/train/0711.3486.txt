    "the observed tight correlation between the mass of the black hole and the global properties of the host galaxy @xcite suggests that the growth of the black holes at their centres is intimately related to the formation and assembly of these galaxies .",
    "however , at any one time only @xmath45% of galaxies are seen as powerful radio sources or show other evidence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the question arises : are the host galaxies of such agn different from the hosts of inactive sources ?    it has been known since the early 1960s that the hosts for powerful radio galaxies are massive ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the trigger for the transition from quiescence to an active state has been suggested to be gravitational interaction between galaxies .",
    "signatures of tidal interactions are common amongst radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; this suggests that the merger process which triggers the radio emission can also lead to star formation in the host galaxy .",
    "however , numerical studies of galaxy interactions and mergers show that star formation is not necessarily enhanced , due to the amount of gas swept out @xcite .",
    "several questions remain to be answered in this scenario : what is the relationship among mergers , the triggering of the active nucleus , and star formation : are all three components necessarily present ?",
    "do all early - type galaxies go through radio galaxy phases as they assemble ?    in order to investigate these questions , we need to study a large and uniform sample of radio galaxies .",
    "samples of this kind have recently been studied in the local universe ( @xmath5 ) by @xcite and @xcite , but until now there has been no comparable sample available at higher redshift .",
    "@xcite investigated the properties of a sample of 2215 nearby radio galaxies ( most with 1.4ghz radio luminosity below @xmath6 ) from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "they showed that the fraction of galaxies hosting a radio - loud agn was a strong function of stellar mass , and that there was no correlation between radio luminosity and optical emission - line luminosity for the galaxies in their sample .",
    "@xcite concluded that optical agn and low - luminosity radio - loud agn are independent phenomena which are triggered by different physical mechanisms .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of 2661 radio - loud agn selected from the 6df galaxy survey .",
    "they confirmed the findings of @xcite that radio - loud agn preferentially inhabit the brightest and most massive host galaxies , and showed that the fraction of all galaxies which host a radio - loud agn scales with the infrared k - band luminosity as @xmath7 .",
    "we have constructed a volume - limited sample of radio sources by combining optical data from the 2slaq lrg survey @xcite with the radio data from the vla first survey @xcite .",
    "the 2slaq sample is focused on luminous red galaxies , thus pre - selecting for the large elliptical galaxies most likely to host powerful radio sources .",
    "@xcite used this sample to study the evolution of the radio sources ; in the current work , we investigate the properties of the host galaxies .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of individual 2slaq spectra is adequate for redshift determinations , but is generally too low for accurate measurement of weak spectral features .",
    "we overcome this limitation by combining spectra to form composites .",
    "this approach allows us to investigate the variation of composites with both redshift and with radio power , and to address the key question : how does the stellar population of a galaxy correlate with the presence or absence of an active radio - loud agn in its centre ?    throughout this paper , we use @xmath8 = 71 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10 = 0.27 and @xmath11 = 0.73 .",

    "the total nvss / first radio flux of each object , including the flux from all separate components identified by eye , was converted to total radio power assuming @xmath16  and @xmath17 , using a @xmath18-correction of the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 , which is the median radio spectral index @xcite .",

    "the sensitivity of the first radio catalogue ( with a typical flux density limit of 0.75  mjy ; * ? ? ?",

    "we began with the wavelength - calibrated spectra produced by the 2slaq project .",
    "these had a typical wavelength coverage of 50007250 , which means that , at the redshift range of our targets , the region containing  h and k and the 4000  break is always covered .",
    "although our spectra go well below 4000  rest wavelength , our observational data are in the spectral region where instrumental and atmospheric effects on continuum slope are not severe . for redshifts beyond @xmath33 , h@xmath34  and  5007",
    "are shifted out of the 2df wavelength range , so the most prominent emission line is  3727 .    to combine the spectra , several steps of processing",
    "were applied to each spectrum .",
    "the regions around the strongest night sky features were removed and replaced by an interpolated value .",
    "we are hampered by the fact that the 2slaq spectra are not flux - calibrated , which means that the instrument response can introduce changes in the slope of the continuum .",
    "we attempted to correct for this , at least in a mean sense , by dividing by an average response curve .",
    "we use the curve derived by @xcite , which compared the 2slaq spectra of 160 galaxies which were also observed by the sdss lrg survey ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ) .",
    "we divided each spectrum by this response curve : since we are producing composite spectra this mean response curve should suffice , even though it does not take into account night - to - night variations .",
    "we then shifted each spectrum to the rest frame using the known redshift , and rebinned all the spectra onto the same scale , between 32804870 , with a dispersion of 1.4 / pixel      the distribution of sources in ( @xmath30,@xmath35 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sourcedist ] .",
    "although the redshifts range from @xmath21 to @xmath36 , and the radio power from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , the bulk of sources cluster near the middle of the range in each parameter .",
    "we thus had two choices : we can create composites with equal numbers of sources , which produces composites with equal signal - to - noise , or we can create composites within equal intervals in redshift or radio power , which maximises the baseline over which we can investigate changes , but at the expense of lowering the signal - to - noise ratio of the outlying composites .",

    "* ) , or weighted by luminosity @xcite ; or the composite can be constructed from the median of individual spectra at each wavelength @xcite . since the 2slaq galaxies are all intrinsically luminous red galaxies , we have taken the simplest approach and created composites by averaging the spectra in each group .",
    "the spectra were all taken with very similar wavelength coverage but have different redshifts , so in each rest wavelength bin , different numbers of spectra contribute to the sum , particularly for the highest and lowest redshifts .",
    "we corrected for this by counting the number of spectra which contribute at each wavelength and dividing the composite by this number .",
    "the composite spectra were then normalised by the flux at 4050 .",
    "since the resolution of the spectral models we chose is 10  ( see   [ sec : modelling ] ) , we binned each composite into 20  bins , and then removed bins which included the bright emission lines , principally  and .",
    "we estimated the errors on the flux in each wavelength bin by measuring the rms of the 14 original pixels which were included in each 20  bin .",
    "we chose to perform the fits to the models over the wavelength range 35004400 , based on our desire to fit the same wavelength region in all spectra ; a total of 33 independent data points in each spectrum were used in the fits .",
    "composites for the matched sample of radio - quiet sources (   [ sec : matched ] ) were created in exactly the same manner ; this data set serves as a control sample to see how the stellar population varies in the absence of a powerful radio source .",
    "to determine if the presence of an active nucleus affects the galaxy , we compared the composites formed from the radio - loud sample and the matched radio - quiet sources (   [ sec : matched ] ) .",

    "this initial evidence suggests that , with the exception of the very highest - power radio sources , there is no evidence of difference between galaxies containing an active agn and those that do not .",
    "we modelled the observed continuum as an old population plus a blue component due to a second population of stars of a younger age , using models from the gissel96 library @xcite .",
    "of the models in their library , we used the ones with a salpeter initial mass function with mass limits of 0.1 and 100  and solar metallicity , using the @xcite stellar spectral atlas .",
    "we used two single - age stellar populations , representing instantaneous bursts of star formation .",
    "the old population was represented by a single - age population of age 7000  myr , the younger stars by a population with a range of ages ( 10 , 20 , 50 , 70 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 700 , 1000 , 2000 or 5000  myr ) .",
    "the exact age of the `` old '' population is not critical , since the spectrum changes little at these ages ; we chose 7  gyr since at the highest redshift in our sample ( @xmath78 ) the age of the universe was 7  gyr .",
    "we assembled the model spectra from the gissel96 library , and binned them to the same resolution as the observed spectra .",
    "since the observed continuum is modelled as the sum of two populations , we assumed each composite is represented as a 7000  myr population plus some fraction @xmath79 of a younger population with age @xmath80 ; our task is to determine @xmath79 and @xmath80 for each composite .",
    "this parametrisation is unlikely to be a realistic representation of the stellar populations of these galaxies .",
    "however , the exact form of the models is not important , because our study is a _ differential _ test , comparing the properties of the radio - loud galaxies with their radio - quiet counterparts .",
    "we created a @xmath81  grid of model spectra .",
    "along one axis , the age of the young population @xmath80  is varied between 10  myr and 5  gyr ; along the other axis the fraction of light contributed by the young population varies linearly between 0 and 100% .",
    "thus the spectrum at grid position ( 5,3 ) consists of an old ( 7 gyr ) population plus a 100  myr population , where the young population is contributing 20% of the light at 4050 .",
    "we calculated the @xmath76 difference between the model spectrum and each of the observed composite spectra for all 121 model spectra .",
    "we allowed the normalisation of the model spectrum to vary between 0.75 and 1.25 of the flux of the observed spectrum at 4050 , to allow for possible differences in slope between the model and the observed spectrum .",
    "this yields a @xmath76 map for each observed composite ; the best fit is chosen to be that where the @xmath76 value is minimised .    the results of the fitting are shown in table  [ tab : composites ] , and shown graphically in figures  [ fig : zfits ] and [ fig : pfits ] .",
    "the best - fitting age and fraction were derived from a parabolic fit to the one - dimensional @xmath76 curves through the minimum .",
    "the error bars represent the confidence interval given by the ellipse representing @xmath82  ( containing @xmath83 of normally distributed data ) . in all cases , the @xmath76 of the two - component model fit was significantly ( @xmath4 factor 2 ) better than the @xmath76 of the fit using a single - aged stellar population .",
    "the results of our modelling can be summarised as follows .",
    "there is no evolution with redshift of the stellar population of the radio galaxies , nor are they in any way different from radio - quiet galaxies matched in redshift and @xmath28 luminosity .",
    "the age of the `` young '' population is unchanged with redshift , with our spectra requiring a second population of stars of age @xmath84 over the whole redshift range of our sample .",
    "the fraction of light contributed by young stars is about 50% , and while it rises slightly over the redshift range of the sample , the change is not significant ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the b - composites and their best - fitting models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modelb ]",
    ".    we can also examine how the spectrum changes as a function of radio power , using the c and d composites defined earlier .",
    "again , our modelling shows no change in the age of the population or the fraction of young stars as the radio power increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pfits ] ) .",
    "the only exception is that the very highest power sources ( the d4 composite , consisting of the 11 sources with @xmath46 ; table  [ tab : composites ] ) appear to have a substantially younger population ( 100  myr ) , as well as strong  3727 emission ( which was not included in the fit ) .",
    "this difference is not seen in the matching sample of radio - quiet sources , suggesting that the young stars are in some way associated with the active nucleus . recall that this was the only composite showing a simple @xmath76 difference with the other composites (   [ sec : differences ] ) .",
    "we checked the eleven individual spectra which went into the d4 composite , in case the composite was being skewed by a single peculiar object .",
    "no individual spectrum appeared to be peculiar ; 6 of the 11 showed strong emission lines .",
    "the d - composites and their best - fitting models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modeld ] .",
    "we tried splitting the second - highest power bin ( d3 ) , to see if there was a continuous trend ; both sub - bins had similar ages , of @xmath86 and @xmath87  myr , quite different from the 100  myr population found in the d4 bin .",
    "thus the difference appears to be confined to the very highest radio - power sources .    in figure",
    "[ fig : modeld - comp ] we plot the ratio of these models .",
    "the figure shows there are small changes to spectral lines , but the principal difference is a change in slope in the model fit to the d4 composite .",
    "we investigated whether the young population in the highest - power radio sources could in fact be due to emission from the central agn , which would also produce excess blue light .",
    "we tried replacing the second , young population in our fits with a power - law continuum of the form @xmath88 , where @xmath89  was allowed to vary between @xmath90  and 0 .",
    "the fit was significantly poorer than the best - fitting model with a young stellar population : the 4000  break was not well reproduced .",
    "thus we conclude that the highest power radio sources do show evidence of association with a population of young stars .",
    "emission lines were present in many of the spectra , mostly , and occasionally  and  ( see table  3 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the  4958,5007 pair was seen in only a single galaxy , j100322.41 - 000137.8 , but was redshifted beyond the wavelength range of most of our sources .",
    "@xcite found that the fraction of 2slaq radio galaxies which show  emission is higher ( 27% ) than the overall 2slaq spectroscopic sample ( 17.7% ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , since more luminous galaxies are more likely to show emission , this result needs to be approached with caution . in any case , most of the radio galaxies in 2slaq would not have been recognised as agn on the basis of their optical spectra alone .",
    "this agrees well with several other studies , which found little evidence of correlation between radio power and emission line strength in nearby radio galaxies @xcite .    by using a comparison sample of radio - quiet galaxies , matched in redshift and luminosity , we are able to investigate this effect .",
    "comparison of the emission - line properties of our radio - loud sources with the matched sample of radio - quiet galaxies reveals differences between the two groups .",
    "we can examine the emission lines in two ways : finding the number of individual galaxies which show emission lines as a function of various parameters , and investigating the properties of the emission lines in the composite spectra .",
    "the equivalent widths of the  line in the individual spectra were measured using the specfit package implemented in iraf @xcite .",
    "we normalised the spectra by a spline fit to the continuum , then measured the equivalent width of the emission line by fitting a gaussian profile to the line",
    ". we must be careful to account for sources where the emission line fell on a sky line , or was redshifted out of the spectrum , and so would not have been detected if it were present .",
    "there were 333 sources in which  was potentially detectable , with sources at redshifts @xmath91 and @xmath92 most strongly affected when the  line fell on a bright sky line .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , found no correlation between radio power and emission line properties ; their samples only reached radio powers @xmath105 .",
    "the emission - line luminosity of very powerful radio sources is known to correlate with radio power ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we could only use five of the ten sources without /  emission in constructing the  composite , because the other five had at least one of the three neon lines falling on a sky line .",

    "we investigated whether the stellar continuum in these emission line composites were at all different ; nothing definitive could be found .",
    "the  composite required a higher proportion of young stars to model the continuum than the neon composite ( 80% compared to 40% ) , but this was only marginally significant ; there were only five spectra in the  composite .",
    "we have investigated the optical properties of a volume - limited sample of radio galaxies in the 2slaq luminous red galaxy survey .",
    "we created composite spectra in order to investigate how the stellar populations of these galaxies depend on redshift or radio power . by constructing a comparison sample of galaxies matched in redshift and luminosity",
    ", we can eliminate the possibility that any effects we find are a result of the fact that radio - loud galaxies are on the average more luminous than radio - quiet galaxies .",
    "we modelled the underlying starlight using single - age stellar population models .",
    "none of the spectra were adequately described by a single model ; they all demanded an additional stellar component .",
    "we achieved satisfactory fits assuming that each spectrum consisted of an `` old '' ( 7  gyr ) population plus a fraction of light contributed by a `` young '' population , whose age was allowed to vary between 10  myr and 5  gyr .",
    "neither a power - law component nor a model with continuous star formation described the spectra as well as the two - stellar population model .",
    "the stellar populations of all the composites were almost identical , independent of redshift , radio power , and whether or not the galaxy contains an active radio source .",
    "the fraction of light contributed by the young population ( @xmath4 40% at 4050 ) increased marginally with redshift , but is not correlated with radio power .",
    "the age of the `` young '' component was consistent with an age of @xmath108  myr for all composites .",
    "the sole exception was the composite made from the eleven most powerful radio sources , with @xmath46 , which was fitted with a young population of age 100  myr .",
    "this was not seen in the corresponding composite of radio - quiet sources , which means it is unlikely to be due to a systematic effect , which would affect both radio - loud and radio - quiet galaxies equally .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that the median redshift of 2slaq radio galaxies is independent of radio power , so there are unlikely to be subtle aperture effects affecting the sample .",
    "the two - population model is probably not a very realistic description of the underlying stellar light .",
    "however , our study is a _",
    "differential _ test , comparing the properties of the radio - loud galaxies with their radio - quiet counterparts . in a future paper",
    ", we will investigate other models to represent the stellar populations of these galaxies .",
    "the emission line properties of the population show more correlation with radio activity .",
    "approximately 15% of the radio - loud sources show significant  emission , compared to 7.5% of the radio - quiet sample ; similarly , the radio - loud sources were roughly twice as likely to show  and/or  emission than their radio - quiet counterparts ( 12% and 6% , respectively ) .",
    "still , it is notable that most of the radio galaxies in the 2slaq would not have been recognised as agn on the basis of their optical spectra alone .",
    "the different /ne line ratios seen in different objects suggest there is more than one emission mechanism operating to ionise the gas : these are likely to include hot stars and post - agb stars as well as ionisation by the central agn .",
    "these observations support the model that all luminous red galaxies contain a central black hole , only some of which are active at any one time ; the current activity of the central black hole , as measured by the radio emission , does not appear to correlate with the stellar population in the galaxy .",
    "the sole exception appears to be that the most powerful radio galaxies show more activity and younger stars than the rest of the population .",
    "even so , with young ( @xmath109 ) stars contributing 30% of the light , the fraction of mass in young stars is only 0.5% of the mass of the galaxy .",
    "we need to be careful to distinguish between differences related to the activity of the central black hole and luminosity effects , since more massive galaxies are more likely to harbour agn .",
    "we controlled for this bias by constructing a matched sample of radio - quiet galaxies .",
    "the comparison sample is matched in redshift and apparent magnitude , so the radio - quiet galaxies match the radio - loud sources closely in absolute luminosity .",
    "since we saw differences in the most powerful radio galaxies , but not in their radio - quiet counterparts , the difference most likely relates to the presence of an active black hole . in paper",
    "i , the 2slaq radio galaxies were found to cluster more strongly than the 2slaq lrg population as a whole @xcite .",
    "it was speculated in that paper that this might be a luminosity effect , since the 2slaq radio galaxies are more luminous than the rest of the sample .",
    "however , recent work using samples matched in luminosity suggest this is not the explanation ( wake et  al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "this suggests the radio galaxies really are preferentially located in denser environments , with more gas available to feed the black hole .",
    "@xcite have recently suggested that a similar effect is seen in lower - redshift radio galaxies from sdss .",
    "our results support the findings of @xcite , who found that the probability that a galaxy is radio - loud is independent of whether it is optically classified as an agn , and that the host galaxies of radio - loud agn match their radio - quiet counterparts . if optical emission lines trace current feeding of black holes , while radio emission points to mostly dormant black holes , accreting at low rates , then the current rate of growth of black holes in these galaxies is very low .",
    "one notable point is that the age of the `` young '' population remains unchanged at 700  myr ( table  [ tab : composites ] ) despite the different ages of the galaxies : the highest redshift galaxies in our sample ( @xmath78 ) are 3.1  gyr younger than the lowest redshift galaxies ( @xmath21 ) . if the stellar populations in the lowest redshift galaxies were born 1  gyr before @xmath21 , we should see the era of star birth , since it is covered in our sample ( at a redshift @xmath110 ) .",
    "we see no evidence , however , for an epoch of star formation at that redshift .",
    "so where are the galaxies which are forming stars as we observe them ? there are two possibilities .",
    "if the single - age stellar population is a bad assumption , we may have low - level ongoing star - formation instead of star formation in discrete bursts .",
    "the second possibility , however , is that the initial colour selection of the 2slaq sample is biased towards accepting galaxies with these ages ; in other words , the counterparts of our @xmath111 galaxies are indeed forming stars at @xmath112 , but they do nt appear as red galaxies while forming stars , so are not included in the 2slaq sample .",
    "in fact , our modelling suggests that we may not notice these galaxies using the 2slaq _ gri _ colour selection criteria .",
    "a model galaxy with 5% of the mass in young stars formed in a single burst ( which contributes 4050% of the light around 1  gyr after the burst ) is only 1 mag bluer than the bulk of old galaxies .",
    "furthermore , since most of the colour evolution occurs very early on , in the first 50  myr , the chances of finding such an object in our sample is not high . in order to locate these galaxies",
    ", we would need to assemble a large sample of luminous galaxies using a different colour selection .",
    "we would like to thank the referee , jasper wall , for his extremely helpful comments and suggestions .",
