    "it should be noted that the behaviour of the effective decay rate @xmath13 as a function of the measurement interval allows us to identify the zeno and anti - zeno regimes .",
    "namely , if @xmath13 increases as @xmath7 increases , we are in the zeno regime , while if @xmath13 decreases if @xmath7 increases , we are in the anti - zeno regime @xcite .",
    "we now consider an alternative way of repeatedly preparing the initial state with time interval @xmath7 .",
    "once again , we start from the initial system state @xmath5 . after time @xmath7 , we know that the state of the system is given by the density matrix @xmath14 $ ] , where once again the evolution due to the free system hamiltonian has been removed .",
    "now , instead of performing the projective measurement @xmath6 , we perform an arbitrary projective measurement given by the projector @xmath15 .",
    "the survival probability is then @xmath16 $ ] , and the post - measurement state is @xmath17 . by performing a unitary operation @xmath18 on the system state on a short timescale , where @xmath19 , we can again end up with the initial state @xmath5 after the measurement .",
    "this process can then , as before , repeated again and again to repeatedly prepare the system state @xmath5 . once again , if the correlations between the system and the environment can be neglected , we can write the effective decay rate as @xmath20 .",
    "but now , we can , in principle , via a suitable choice of the projector @xmath15 , obtain a larger survival probability ( and a correspondingly smaller decay rate ) than what was obtained with repeatedly using projective measurements given by the projector @xmath6 .",
    "the question , then , is what is this projector @xmath15 that should be chosen to maximize the survival probability ?    for an arbitrary quantum system , it is difficult to give a general condition or formalism that will predict this optimal projective measurement .",
    "however , most studies of the effect of repeated quantum measurements on quantum systems have been performed by considering the quantum system to be a single two - level system @xcite .",
    "let us now show that if the quantum system is a two - level system , then it is straightforward to derive a general method for calculating the optimal projective measurements that need to be performed as well as an expression for the optimized decay rate .",
    "we start from the observation that the system density matrix at time @xmath7 , just before the measurement , can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the bloch vector of the system state .",
    "we are interested in maximizing the survival probability @xmath16 $ ] .",

    ", we find that the survival probability is @xmath25 it should then be obvious how to find the optimal projective measurement @xmath15 that needs to be performed .",
    "the maximum survival probability is obtained if @xmath24 is parallel to @xmath22 .",
    "if we know @xmath26 , we can find out @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , @xmath24 is simply the unit vector parallel to @xmath22 .",
    "once we know @xmath24 , we know the projective measurement @xmath15 that needs to be performed .",
    "the corresponding optimal survival probability is given by @xmath27 now , if we ignore the correlations between the system and environment , which is valid for weak system - environment coupling , we can again derive the effective decay rate of the quantum state to be @xmath28 .",
    "we now investigate the optimal effective decay rate for a variety of system - environment models .      to begin , we consider the paradigmatic population decay model .",
    "the system - environment hamiltonian is ( we use @xmath29 throughout ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy difference between the two levels , @xmath32 is the standard pauli matrix , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the raising and lowering operators , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the annihilation and creation operators for mode @xmath37 of the environment . it should be noted that here we have made the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "this system - environment hamiltonian is widely used to study , for instance , spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "we consider the very low temperature regime .",
    "we initially prepare the system - environment state @xmath38 that describes the two - level system to be in the excited state and the environment oscillators to be in their ground state .",
    "ordinarily , in the studies of the qze and the qaze , the system is repeatedly projected onto the excited state with time interval @xmath7 . as discussed before",
    ", we , on the other hand , allow the system to be projected onto some other state such that the effective decay rate is minimized . to find this optimal projective measurement , we need to understand how the bloch vector of the system evolves in time .",
    "due to the structure of the system - environment hamiltonian , the system - environment state at a later time @xmath7 can be written as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 means that the two - level system is in the ground state and that mode @xmath37 of the environment has been excited .",
    "it then follows that the density matrix of the system at time @xmath7 is @xmath41    we consequently find that the components of the bloch vector of the system are @xmath42 , while @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we have a nice interpretation for the dynamics of the system .",
    "initially , the system is in the excited state .",
    "as time goes on , the coherences remain zero , and the probability that the system makes a transition to the ground state increases . in other words , initially the bloch vector of the system is a unit vector with @xmath44 .",
    "the bloch vector then decreases in magnitude ( while keeping the @xmath45 and @xmath46 components zero ) until the size of the bloch vector becomes zero .",
    "the bloch vector thereafter flips direction and increases in length until effectively @xmath47 .",
    "since the direction of the bloch vector corresponding to the optimal measurement is parallel to the bloch vector of the system , we find that if the measurement interval is short enough such that @xmath48 , then we should keep on applying the projector @xmath49 . on the other hand , if the measurement interval is large enough so that @xmath50 , then we should rather apply the projector @xmath51 , and then , just after the measurement , apply a @xmath52 pulse so as to end up with the system state @xmath53 again .",
    "in other words , the time @xmath54 at which the bloch vector flips direction is of critical importance to us and needs to be found out in order to optimize the effective decay rate . to find this time , we assume that the system and the environment are weakly coupled and thus we can use a master equation to analyze the dynamics of the system . since we numerically solve this master equation",
    ", we might as well put back in the non - rotating wave approximation terms so that the system - environment interaction that we consider in solving the master equation is @xmath55 .",
    "the master equation that we use can be written as @xmath56 + \\int_{0}^{t } ds \\big \\ { [ \\bar{f}(t , s)\\rho_s(t ) , f ] c_{t s } + \\ ; \\text{h.c . }",

    "@xmath68 parametrizes the system - environment coupling strength , @xmath69 characterizes the ohmicity of the environment , and @xmath70 is the cutoff frequency .",
    "we can then numerically solve this differential equation to find the system density matrix at any time @xmath71 and consequently the bloch vector of the system .",
    "we consequently know the optimal projective measurement that needs to performed .",
    "we now present a computational example ( see the previous page ) .",
    "we plot the single measurement survival probability [ see fig .",
    "[ popdecaymerged2](a ) ] and the effective decay rate [ see fig .",

    "the dotted lines illustrate what happens if we keep on projecting the system state onto @xmath53 . for a small measurement interval ,",
    "the optimal measurement is @xmath49 since the system bloch vector has only a positive @xmath72-component . on the other hand ,",
    "if we realize that when the measurement interval is long enough such that , between each measurement , the bloch vector flips direction , then to maximize the survival probability , we should project instead onto the state @xmath73 and then apply @xmath52 pulse . doing so , we can obtain a higher survival probability or , equivalently , a lower effective decay rate .",
    "this is precisely what we observe from the figure . for this population decay case",
    ", we find that if the measurement interval is larger than @xmath74 , then we are better off by performing the measurement @xmath51 .",
    "there is also a small change in the anti - zeno behaviour . for our modified strategy of repeatedly preparing the quantum state",
    ", we find that beyond measurement interval @xmath75 , there is a sharper signature of anti - zeno behaviour as compared to the usual strategy of repeatedly measuring the excited state of the system .",
    "we now analyze our strategy for the case of the pure dephasing model @xcite .",
    "the system - environment hamiltonian is now given by @xmath76 the difference now compared to the previous population decay model is that the system - environment coupling term now contains @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 .",
    "this difference implies that the diagonal entries of the system density matrix @xmath79 ( in the @xmath80 basis ) can not change - only dephasing can possibly take place , which is the reason that this model is known as the pure dephasing model@xcite .",
    "furthermore , this pure dephasing model is exactly solvable .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix undergo both unitary time evolution due to the system hamiltonian and non - unitary time evolution due to the coupling with the environment . assuming the initial state of the total system is the standard product state @xmath81 , the off - diagonals of the density matrix @xmath82_{mn}$ ] , once the evolution due to the system hamiltonian itself is removed , are given by @xmath82_{mn } =   [ \\rho_{s}(0)]_{mn } e^{- \\gamma(\\tau)}$ ] where @xmath83@xcite .",
    "writing an arbitrary initial state of the system as @xmath84 , it is straightforward to find that @xmath85 the optimal survival probability obtained using optimized measurements is then @xmath86 where eq .   has been used .",
    "on the other hand , if we keep on preparing the initial state @xmath5 by using the projective measurements @xmath6 , we find that @xmath87    we now analyze eqs .   and to find conditions under which we can lower the effective decay rate by using optimized projective measurements .",
    "it is clear that if the initial state , in the bloch sphere picture , lies in the equatorial plane , then @xmath88 while @xmath89 . in this case ,",
    "eqs .   and",
    "give the same survival probability .",
    "thus , in this case , there is no advantage of using our strategy of optimized measurements as compared with the usual strategy .",
    "the reasoning is clear . in the bloch sphere picture ,",
    "the magnitude of the time evolved bloch vector of the density matrix reduces such that the time evolved bloch vector is always parallel to the bloch vector of the initial pure system state .",
    "as argued before , the optimal projector to measure at time @xmath7 , @xmath90 , must be parallel to the bloch vector of the density matrix at time @xmath7 .",
    "hence in this case , the optimal projector to measure is @xmath91 , corresponding to the initial state . the computational example shown in fig .",
    "[ dephasing1](a ) illustrates our predictions .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we make some other choice of the initial state that we repeatedly prepare , we can easily see that our optimized strategy can give us an advantage .",
    "we simply look for the case where the evolved bloch vector ( after removal of the evolution due to the system hamiltonian ) no longer remains parallel with the initial bloch vector . upon inspecting eq .",
    ", we find that our optimized strategy can be advantageous if @xmath92 ( excluding , of course , the cases @xmath93 ) .",
    "in other words , if the bloch vector of the initial state does not lie in the equatorial plane , then the bloch vector of this state at some later time will not remain parallel to the initial bloch vector . in this case then , our optimal measurement scheme will give a higher survival probability as compared to repeatedly measuring the same initial state .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dephasing1](b ) where we show the effective decay rate and the survival probability after a single measurement for the initial state specified by the bloch vector @xmath94 . after the time at which the transition between the zeno and the anti - zeno regimes occurs",
    ", we clearly observe that the decay rate is lower when one makes the optimal projective measurements .",
    "although this difference on first sight may not appear as very significant , if we perform a relatively large number of repeated measurements , the difference is very significant .",
    "for example , even for three measurements with measurement interval @xmath95 , we find that the quantum state has @xmath96 greater survival probability with the optimized measurements as compared with the usual unoptimized strategy of repeatedly preparing the quantum state .",
    "another computational example has been provided in fig .",
    "[ dephasing2 ] where the initial state is now given by the bloch vector @xmath97 . in fig .",
    "[ dephasing2](a ) we have again illustrated that our optimized strategy of repeatedly preparing the quantum state is better at protecting the quantum compared to the usual strategy . in fig .",
    "[ dephasing2](b ) we have shown how the optimal projective measurement that needs to be performed changes with the measurement interval @xmath7 . in order to do so , we have parametrized the bloch vector corresponding to @xmath15 using the usual spherical polar angles @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "note that the value of the azimuthal angle @xmath99 is expected to remain constant since we have @xmath100 .",
    "on the other hand , the optimal value of the polar angle @xmath98 changes with the measurement interval .",
    "this is also expected since as the system dephases , @xmath101 , ensuring that @xmath102 .",
    "thus , for long measurement intervals , the system bloch vector becomes effectively parallel to the @xmath103 .",
    "it follows that @xmath104 for long measurement intervals .",
    "these predictions are borne out by the behaviour of @xmath98 and @xmath99 in fig .",
    "[ dephasing2](b ) .",
    "we now consider the more general system - environment model given by the hamiltonian    @xmath105    where @xmath106 can be understood as the tunneling amplitude for the system , and the rest of the parameters are defined as before .",
    "this is the well - known spin - boson model@xcite , which can be considered as an extension of the previous two cases in that we can now generally have both population decay and dephasing taking place .",
    "experimentally , such a model can be realized , for instance , using superconducting qubits @xcite and the properties of the environment can be appropriately tuned as well @xcite .",
    "once again , assuming that the system and the environment are interacting weakly with each other , we can use the master equation that we have used before [ see eq .  ] to find the system density matrix as a function of time .",
    "we now have @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "it should be remembered that once we find the density matrix just before the measurement @xmath26 , we remove the evolution due to system hamiltonian via @xmath109 .",
    "let us first choose as the initial state @xmath110 ( or , in the words , the state that is paramterized by @xmath111 and @xmath112 on the bloch sphere ) . in fig .",
    "[ sb1 ] , we plot the behaviour of the effective decay rate as a function of the measurement interval using both our optimized strategy ( the solid red lines ) and the unoptimized usual strategy ( the dotted , blue curves ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ sb1](a ) that for relatively short measurement intervals , there is little to be gained by using the optimal strategy .",
    "as we have seen before in the pure dephasing case , for the state in the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere , there is no advantage to be gained by following the optimized strategy . on the other hand , for longer time intervals @xmath7",
    ", population decay can be considered to become more significant .",
    "this then means we that see significant difference at long measurement intervals if we use the optimized strategy .",
    "this is precisely what we observe in fig .",
    "[ sb1](b ) .    for completeness ,",
    "let us also investigate how the the effective decay rate depends on the functional form of the spectral density . in fig .",
    "[ sb2](a ) and fig .",
    "[ sb2](b ) , we investigate what happens in the case of a sub - ohmic and a super - ohmic environment respectively .",
    "the case of a sub - ohmic environment with @xmath113 is similar to the case with @xmath114 ( ohmic environment ) - once again , the optimal projective measurements decrease the decay rate substantially only at long periods of time . for the case of a super - ohmic environment with @xmath115",
    "[ see fig .",
    "[ sb2](b ) ] , we find that the optimal projective measurements do not substantially lower the decay rate , even for long times .",
    "thus , it is clear that the ohmicity of the environment plays an important role in determining the usefulness of using the optimal projective measurements .",
    "let us now revert to the ohmic environment case to present more computational examples .",
    "first , if @xmath116 , then the effect of dephasing is much more dominant than the effect of population decay . results for this case are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sb2](c ) .",
    "we see that there is negligible difference upon using the optimal measurements .",
    "this agrees with what we found when we analyzed the pure dephasing model .",
    "we also analyze the opposite case where the effect of population decay is more dominant than the effect of dephasing .",
    "this is done by setting @xmath117 .",
    "we consider higher temperature in this case .",
    "we now observe differences between the unoptimized and optimized decay rates for relatively short times [ see fig .  [ sb2](d ) ] , and the difference becomes even bigger at longer times .",
    "in fact , while we observe predominantly only the zeno effect with the unoptimized measurements , we observe very distinctly both the zeno and the anti - zeno regimes with the optimized measurements .",
    "we extend our study to a collection of two - level systems interacting with a common environment .",
    "this hamiltonian can be considered to be a generalization of the usual spin - boson model to a large spin @xmath118 @xcite , where @xmath119 is the number of two - level systems coupled to the environment .",
    "physical realizations include a two - component bose - einstein condensate @xcite that interacts with a thermal reservoir via collisions @xcite . in this case , the system - environment hamiltonian is given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the usual angular momentum operators and the environment is again modeled as a collection of harmonic oscillators .",

    ", the system dynamics can be found exactly .",
    "the system density matrix , in the eigenbasis of @xmath122 , after removal of the evolution due to the system hamiltonian can be written as @xmath124_{mn } = [ \\rho(0)]_{mn } e^{- i\\triangle(t ) ( m^2 - n^2 ) } e^{- \\gamma(t ) ( m - n)^2}$ ] . here",

    "<S> namely , we find that the dynamically evolving bloch vector of the quantum system determines the optimal projective measurement and , in turn , the optimal survival probability . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in general , the optimal projective measurements depend on the time interval between the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts sharply with the usual scenario where the same projective measurement is performed repeatedly , regardless of the measurement interval . </S>",
    "<S> applications of the condition derived are illustrated by studying the usual decay rate and the optimized decay rate for the population decay model , the pure dephasing model , and the spin - boson model . </S>",
    "<S> since the behaviour of the effective decay rate allows us to identify the quantum zeno and anti - zeno regimes , we can instead use this optimized decay rate to look at the quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider a collection of two - level systems interacting with a common environment . in this case , finding the optimal projective measurement is a very difficult problem . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can restrict ourselves to measurements that project onto spin coherent states since these are the measurements that can be performed relatively easily experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> for this scenario , we again derive the optimal measurements and the optimized decay rate for the pure dephasing case as well as the more general scenario with both dephasing and relaxation present . once again , we find that there can be signficant differences between the unoptimized decay rate and the optimized decay rate . </S>",
    "<S> these differences translate to differences in the qze and the qaze . </S>"
