    "iron - chromium steels are of great technological importance due to their superior properties at high temperatures and under aggressive chemical conditions . in particular",
    ", they are used in reactor environments because of their good swelling and corrosion resistance.@xcite the precise origin of many of these beneficial features is still uncertain .",
    "creep resistance is customarily associated with the presence of _ small _ @xmath3-precipitates , while embrittlement has been related to the presence of _ larger _ @xmath3-precipitates .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3-phases are the fe - rich and cr - rich solid solutions into which the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) phase of the alloy decomposes at temperatures below about 1000k . at yet higher temperatures a third phase appears around equiatomic composition , known as the @xmath4-phase .",
    "the phase diagram for this alloy has been assessed using the calphad methodology.@xcite in this approach the alloy was assumed to behave as a subregular solution at temperatures below the existence range of the @xmath4-phase . in other words , the heat of formation is assumed to be positive over the entire composition and it is parameterized by a second degree polynomial in the redlich - kister expansion .",
    "there is , however , an ensemble of experimental observations at relatively low temperatures in both annealed and irradiated samples , which suggest a more complex behavior .",
    "@xcite    a breakthrough in the understanding of the microstructure of these alloys was made through neutron diffraction measurements @xcite which showed ( 1 ) negative cowley short - range order ( sro ) parameters ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : sro ] ) below ) at small cr concentrations indicating strong short - range ordering of cr atoms , and ( 2 ) an inversion of the sign of these parameters with increasing cr concentration , which seems to imply a change of sro in the solid solution as it approaches the solubility limit .",
    "the implications of these discoveries for the interpretation of creep resistance and embrittlement are apparent , since sro is known to affect the mobility of dislocations @xcite and precipitation plays a role in intergranular cracking.@xcite    nonetheless the understanding of the atomistic details of the complex behavior of this alloy is still incomplete .",
    "this situation has motivated a number of recent first - principles studies @xcite which addressed the energetics of this system .",
    "these calculations revealed a change of sign in the heat of formation of the solution from the negative to the positive side as the cr concentration increases above approximately @xmath5.@xcite detailed analysis of the origin of this anomaly showed that , while the heat of solution of a cr impurity in fe is large and negative , magnetic frustration leads to a strong cr ",
    "cr repulsion , causing the heat of formation to assume large positive values as the cr content increases .",
    "these advances in the understanding of the energetics of fe  cr alloys have provided the basis for the development of accurate interatomic potential models , which enable large scale simulations of the microstructural evolution .",
    "two approaches were developed known as the two band model @xcite and the composition dependent model , @xcite which both address the complex shape of the heat of formation curve at 0k as determined from the aforementioned first - principles calculations .",
    "a third approach @xcite to model the finite temperature properties of this alloy is based on a cluster expansion fitted to density functional theory data which is then used it in combination with lattice monte carlo simulations to study precipitation and ordering . using the composition dependent model",
    ", we recently studied the implications of the change in sign of the heat of formation on the thermodynamic behavior at finite temperatures and proposed a modified phase diagram for fe  cr in the region of low cr content and temperatures below the range of existence of the @xmath4-phase.@xcite in fact compared to the calphad assessment,@xcite which is based on the assumption of a _ standard segregating binary _ mixture ( positive heat of mixing at all concentrations , compare above ) , a better agreement with the experimental location of the _ solvus _ was obtained .    from our viewpoint",
    "three aspects render the study of sro in fe ",
    "cr alloys particularly interesting : ( 1 ) experimental measurements of sro parameters of heterogeneous systems ( such as mixtures of the @xmath2 and @xmath3-phases ) provide only compound quantities equivalent to averages over the entire sample .",
    "( 2 ) in fe ",
    "cr this situation is further complicated by the ordering tendency of the system at low cr concentrations .",
    "( 3 ) the recent advances in the development of fe  cr interatomic potentials and the availability of suitable simulation techniques provide the possibility to explore the atomistic details of these processes .",
    "thereby , we are able to resolve the contributions to the experimentally measured quantities and understand the microscopic behavior of the material .",
    "we discuss the evolution of the sro parameter in a mixture of two phases and the evolution of the sro parameter upon coarsening , induced e.g. , by aging or irradiation .",
    "it is shown that the experimentally observed inversion of the sro parameter is due to the formation of stable ( supercritical ) @xmath3-precipitates .",
    "it is not related to an overall loss of sro , a loss of sro in the @xmath2-phase , or to the presence of unstable ( subcritical ) cr precipitates in the @xmath2-phase .",
    "furthermore , by using the same order parameter as in the experimental reports , we reconcile an apparent discrepancy between experimental data and the model predictions reported in ref .  .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sect : sro ] introduces the order parameters used in this work , while sect .",
    "[ sect : method ] describes the methodology .",
    "section [ sect : results ] contains the results of the simulations organized into three subsections , which address ( _ i _ ) the relation between the chemical potential difference and the concentration , ( _ ii _ ) the sro in the @xmath2-phase , and ( _ iii _ ) the evolution of the sro in the two - phase region . in sect .",
    "[ sect : discussion ] a simple expression for the sro in the two - phase region is introduced , which is subsequently employed to interpret the experimental result and to derive the temperature dependence of the sro parameter .",
    "section  [ sect : conclusions ] summarizes the conclusions .",
    "short - range order in binary alloys is conveniently measured by means of the order parameter introduced by cowley @xcite which has been widely applied in the past ( see e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the sro parameter for the @xmath6-th shell of a cr atom is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the number of fe atoms in the @xmath6-th shell , @xmath9 is the total number of atoms in the same shell and @xmath10 is the overall ( total ) cr concentration .",
    "it is instructive to consider several special cases : ( 1 ) if a cr atom is surrounded exclusively by other cr atoms , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "( 2 ) if one has a completely random distribution the ratio @xmath13 equals @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "( 3 ) finally , if each cr atom is surrounded exclusively by fe atoms @xmath16 and therefore @xmath17 which provides a lower bound to the sro parameter , in other words it indicates the maximum possible degree of short - range order at a given composition .",
    "previous experimental studies of sro in fe  cr have used a sro parameter specific for the bcc lattice.@xcite this parameter is defined as a coordination number - weighted average of the sro parameters defined above for the first and second neighbor shells @xmath18 other studies @xcite assumed the sro parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 to be the same which leads to similar results . for consistency with literature and to simplify comparison we focus on this bcc - specific weighted sro parameter in the following sections . in sect .",
    "[ sect : sro_ss ] we will however explicitly discuss the sro parameters for different shells , which yields insights into the range of cr  cr interactions .",
    "if one is to study the problem of short - range order and the formation of precipitates in a segregating alloy while including the effects of local relaxations , one requires an algorithm , which is capable of efficiently taking into account both chemical mixing and atomic relaxation .",
    "the former can be achieved by employing a monte - carlo ( mc ) algorithm which allows changes in the chemical identity of the particles as will be discussed in the following two paragraphs . in principle",
    "atomic relaxations can be captured by a displacement mc algorithm but for the problem at hand molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations turn out to be more efficient .",
    "the basic approach is thus to alternate mc moves and md steps .",
    "the usual approach to model the effects of chemical mixing in heterogeneous solid solutions , is to employ a mc swap algorithm , in which the global composition is kept constant and the system is advanced by swapping pairs of particles of different chemical identities .",
    "the change in total energy is employed to decide whether a move is accepted or rejected . for single phase systems one can also use a semi - grand canonical ensemble ( sgc ) , in which the composition is determined by the difference of the chemical potentials @xmath21 of the species , and",
    "each mc move is equivalent to exchanging particles with the external reservoirs of both chemical species . unlike the swap scheme the sgc - mc algorithm can be formulated to operate only on one particle at a time .",
    "therefore , the latter can be more easily parallelized .    within a two - phase region of the phase diagram the relation between the concentration @xmath22 and the chemical potential difference",
    "@xmath21 has an infinite slope . in principle",
    ", the sgc - mc algorithm can not deal with such situations , and in order to keep the global composition within the miscibility gap , one must apply an additional constraint .",
    "the latter can be formally derived as a constraint on the concentration fluctuations , the formal derivation of which will be given elsewhere.@xcite for the present study , we implemented the constraint in a very simple way , namely as a limitation on the number of particles in the reservoirs : when the ( externally specified ) maximum global concentration of solute atoms is reached , mc moves which lead to a further increase of the solute concentration are always rejected , regardless of their energy , i. e. the maximum number of solute atoms is limited . to clarify this approach ,",
    "consider the case in which constraints are imposed on both the maximum and the minimum number of solute atoms .",
    "in the ( hypothetical ) limit that the difference between the lower and upper limit vanishes , this algorithm would become equivalent to the swapping algorithm .",
    "we recall here that the primary motivation behind the development of this algorithm is that it can efficiently be parallelized .    to summarize , for values of @xmath21 within the @xmath2-phase , our simulations start with pure fe samples and by alternating mc moves with md steps the sample loads solute atoms and relaxes the lattice in the solid solution until the equilibrium composition is reached and stationary fluctuations reach canonical values .",
    "if @xmath21 exceeds the stability range of the @xmath2-phase , the simulation still starts from a pure fe sample and first establishes a solid solution in the @xmath2-phase . since the formation of a supercritical nucleus",
    "is linked to a nucleation barrier , precipitation does not occur immediately but only after some residence time .",
    "the system therefore evolves initially in a single phase .",
    "however , as soon as the spatial fluctuations in the composition have lead to the formation of supercritical nuclei , they will grow rapidly and the global cr concentration rises sharply .",
    "when the target global composition is reached , or equivalently , when the volume fraction of @xmath3-precipitates reaches the target value , the concentration constraint keeps the system fluctuating around the pre - set global composition , and coarsening of the precipitates is observed .",
    "the residence time prior to the formation of stable @xmath3-precipitates depends on @xmath21 , i.e. on the chemical driving force for precipitation .",
    "if the difference of the chemical potentials exceeds the stability range of the @xmath2-phase only slightly , residence times are rather long ( in terms of mc steps ) and meaningful averages ( with regard to sro ) can be obtained ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sro_evo ] below for an example ) . as described above , in the early stages of a simulation , some",
    "@xmath3-nuclei may exist in the @xmath2-phase , but they do not yet exceed the critical size .",
    "fluctuations in the composition eventually lead to the formation of stable ( supercritical ) @xmath3-precipitates , which subsequently coarsen . while this evolution can not be related to a physical time scale .",
    "because atoms do not move via diffusion but via swaps , it nevertheless represents the sequence of steps followed during the real evolution of a saturated @xmath2-phase .",
    "similarly , sro develops in the @xmath2-phase in the course of the simulation , and reaches equilibrium before the @xmath23-microstructure emerges , reflecting the fact that precipitation is a first order phase transition with a nucleation barrier , while order - disorder is not .",
    "we used samples with @xmath24 conventional bcc unit cells equivalent to 128,000 atoms .",
    "simulations were carried out for temperatures between 100 and 900k and chemical potential differences between @xmath25 and @xmath26 . to obtain the data presented below , the samples were run for a total of @xmath27 mc steps / atom .",
    "we have found this number to be sufficient to obtain well converged results for the sro parameter . for chemical potential differences which are equivalent to cr concentrations below the solubility",
    "limit the system equilibrates quickly .",
    "averages are obtained over all configurations in the markov chain after the initial equilibration period . for values of the chemical potential difference which correspond to concentrations slightly _ above _ the solubility",
    "limit the system does not immediately separate into two phases due to the nucleation barrier associated with this process ( compare previous paragraph ) . instead one observes a transient state during which the system equilibrates in the solid solution .",
    "once a supercritical nucleus of the secondary phase has formed , it grows very quickly and the system decomposes into two phases .",
    "( an example of this behavior is shown in fig .",

    "hence , depending on the kinetics of the system @xmath46 and @xmath51 can assume a range of values .",
    "both are expected to grow gradually as the system coarsens and gets closer and closer to equilibrium .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sro_avg ] as described in the following .    if one uses the theoretical lower limit for @xmath55 , which as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sro_ss ] represents the low temperature limit of the simulation data for the @xmath2-phase , one obtains an entirely analytic expression for @xmath51 .",
    "the resulting curves for different values of @xmath46 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sro_avg ] where the solubility of cr has been set to @xmath56 roughly corresponding to the experimental solubility at this temperature .",
    "all curves are negative for small cr concentrations , then pass through zero and eventually approach saturation .",
    "the transition from negative to positive values is the hallmark of cr precipitation and rather sharp .",
    "as discussed above at a given temperature the only variable is the sro parameter for the @xmath3-precipitates which depends on their size distribution .",
    "the most extremal value is @xmath57 which is achieved if the number of @xmath23-interface atoms is negligible with respect to the number of atoms in @xmath3-precipitates .",
    "the resulting curve is shown by the most upper line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sro_avg ] . for smaller @xmath3-precipitates the sro parameter @xmath46 is smaller than one .",
    "the resulting sro parameter , @xmath51 , is shown in fig .",

    "thus will gradually grow from the lower to the upper curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sro_avg ] .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that the effect of a reduced @xmath46 becomes notable for @xmath59 .",
    "it should be stressed that the interpretation of the evolution of the average sro parameter @xmath51 upon aging is solely based on a gradual approach to equilibrium , i.e. the coarsening of the precipitates .",
    "this conclusion is independent of our mc simulations .      on the basis of the foregoing analysis",
    ", it is now possible to carry out a quantitative comparison with the experimental data points included in figures [ fig : sro_ss ] , [ fig : sro_avg ] and [ fig : sro_temp ] .",
    "since all experiments considered here correspond to temperatures close to 700k , we focus on the sro curve calculated at this temperature .",
    "the experimental data point obtained at @xmath60 cr corresponds to a fe - rich homogeneous solid solution and the simulation data for the @xmath2-phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sro_ss ] ) as well as the predicted average sro parameter @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sro_avg ] ) are in very good agreement .",
    "we suggest that at @xmath5 cr @xmath3-precipitates are formed in the experimental samples which drive the sro parameter upwards leading to an average sro parameter value close to zero .",
    "this trend is reproduced by the theoretical curve which yields a transition through zero close to the experimental data point .",
    "the comparison with the calculated curves shows that the inversion of the sro is very steep and is shifted to slightly larger concentration with respect to the solubility limit .",
    "there are several data points at concentrations close to 15%  which are scattered between @xmath61 and 0.2 : the measurements in ref .",

    "all samples were initially quenched from 1473k and subsequently annealed / irradiated at 723k .",

    "the experimental error bars the sro parameter was zero for the initial sample .",
    "it was observed to increase with exposure time in a series of bombardments with fe@xmath62 .",
    "the largest sro was obtained after extended irradiation with ar@xmath62 ions .",
    "collecting the experimental data and using the above analysis , the following interpretation for the observations at higher cr concentrations emerges : ( 1 ) the samples initially obtained by quenching from high temperature show a very small sro parameter close to zero .",
    "this suggests that during rapid quenching from elevated temperatures both the ordering tendency and more importantly the precipitation and growth of @xmath3-precipitates are suppressed ( lowest data point from e2 ) .",
    "( 2 ) on the other hand , the most extensively aged samples show a rather large sro parameter which is close to the values predicted by the theoretical analysis presented above ( e1 ) .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath3-precipitates in these samples have already reached rather large dimensions ( diminishing the contribution of the @xmath23-interface ) .",

    "[ fig : sro_ss ] for the sro parameter in the @xmath2-phase .",
    "the temperature dependence of the solubility was taken from ref .   and is indicated by the small arrows at the bottom of the figure .",
    "[ fig : sro_temp ] ]    the shape of the sro curves and the transition through zero are affected by temperature because of the @xmath64-dependence of both the sro in the @xmath2-phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sro_ss ] ) and the solubility of cr in @xmath2-fe.@xcite if these effects are taken into account one obtains the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sro_temp ] .",
    "the increase of the solubility with temperature @xcite shifts the transition of the sro parameter through zero to larger concentrations , whereas the @xmath64-dependence of the sro in the @xmath2-phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sro_ss ] ) causes a slight upward shift of the average sro .",
    "note that the transition through zero is correlated with but not identical to the solubility of cr .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the short - range order ( sro ) in fe - rich fe  cr alloys using atomistic simulations based on an empirical potential description of the alloy . for low temperatures and small concentrations the sro in the @xmath2-phase",
    "is found to be close to the theoretical maximum possible sro . as temperature increases sro",
    "is reduced due to entropic effects . for somewhat larger cr concentrations",
    "the sro curves go through a minimum , which occurs close to the solubility limit .",
    "the occurrence of a minimum reflects the competition between energy induced ordering and entropy - driven randomization .",
    "it is , however , important to stress that directly at the solubility the sro is still rather strong .    in the two - phase region",
    "the experimentally measured sro parameter is a mixture of both the sro in the @xmath2-phase and the @xmath3-precipitates .",
    "the mc simulations show that the two contributions can be clearly separated . when using a weighted average of these contributions the average sro parameter is predicted as a function of concentration in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the mc simulations in conjunction with this simple model demonstrate that the inversion of the sro parameter observed experimentally is a result of the formation of stable ( supercritical ) @xmath3-precipitates .",
    "it is _ not _ related to the loss of sro in the @xmath2-phase , since directly at the solubility limit there is still an appreciable degree of sro . the model has also been used to investigate the effect of temperature on the sro parameter which shows the temperature dependence of the solubility of cr in fe to be the dominating factor .    the results reported here are anticipated to support future research in at least two aspects : ( 1 ) as indicated in the introduction the sro affects the mobility of dislocations .",
    "the present paper therefore constitutes a basis for a detailed atomistic study of the mobility of dislocations in fe  cr alloys following a strategy similar to ref .  .",
    "( 2 ) the present paper clarifies the contributions to the average sro parameter in a two - phase system and introduces a simple predictive model . it thereby provides a better understanding of previous experimental results and provides the basis for a more elaborate interpretation of future experiments .",
