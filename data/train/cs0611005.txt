    "cern has been an active leader of particle physics research for just over fifty years . during that period ,",
    "physicists have led and developed a preprint - sharing culture which in its present , electronic incarnation is capturing the imagination of open access ( oa ) enthusiasts , academic librarians and repository managers , research institution directors , and the researchers themselves in fields other than physics , who wish to speed up , and open up , the process of scholarly communication .",
    "we wish to share with the library community the ways in which the cern library and document server teams have successfully managed and filled their preprint repository , the directions in which the management of this repository is now moving , and the implications this has for the future of scholarly communication in the particle physics field . using technical protocols to fill and manage the repository in turn changes the protocols governing the communication environment and the processes of writing , publishing and reading scientific documents become more integrated .",
    "each year cern authors produce around 2000 original papers , and make about 10,000 conference contributions . in an extension of the original paper - era mandate , the library is charged with collecting evidence of this activity in its various forms ; this includes not just the collection of electronic versions of the published papers , but also copies of slides , posters , lecture notes and other kinds of contributions .",
    "collecting such items not only enables the library to make them available to the world - wide physics community but also makes it possible to archive the material to protect the history of cern s existence .    in order to store and manage these documents , cern created in 1993 an institutional repository which now exists under the name of the cern document server ( cds ) , an instance of the cds invenio repository software .",
    "the repository was merged with the library s catalogue software in 1996 so that the collections are now displayed in a single interface .",
    "the total number of records in cds is approaching one million and is growing by an average of 280 each day . with the small number of cataloging staff this number of records",
    "could not be created manually nor handled individually and so the preprint management team has devised a number of technical solutions for the delivery of catalogue records from other databases and institutional and subject repositories , and for the updating and enhancement of those records .    to facilitate searching ,",
    "the materials are subdivided into collections of physically similar items , and collections of interest to particular groups .",
    "so , a user can easily limit his or her search to find a book on the library shelves , or to find photos , meeting minutes , articles and conference reports on the design of the atlas detector .",
    "cds also has quick links to the submission interface whereby files can be uploaded to the server by any member of cern staff , and a file conversion service which enables users to convert files into a format that is more easily archived such as the portable document format , or ascii text .",
    "although cern authors are required by cern rules to submit their documents to the library @xcite , in reality this happens for less than half of the known publications . the rest are mostly detected by the performance of regular web searches from where the full - text is also retrieved when possible .",
    "due to these efforts , the library believes it locates almost 100% of the metadata of cern - authored documents , and in recent years has managed to also obtain oa full - text versions of over 70% of those documents @xcite .",
    "retro - scanning projects both at cern and japan s kek library , and permission from aps and other publishers to allow download of published versions , have brought many thousands of older documents into the digital oa environment such that around 54% of all cern scientific documents published since 1954 are now available for free in full - text versions .    in total",
    "there are over 850,000 bibliographic records including records for library books and journals , of which 450,000 have electronic full - text , oa documents attached .",
    "the metadata for virtually all cds records is available free to those wishing to harvest and use it .",
    "the only exceptions are records of sensitive and financial nature and managerial documents .    as cern already has a mandate for self - archiving ,",
    "other methods are being planned and implemented to both directly and indirectly encourage submission .",
    "direct emailing of authors is an option for chasing missing items , and a promotion campaign has been directed at raising awareness of oa issues and reminding about submission procedures .",
    "these are both aimed at directly improving author submission .",
    "however , more subtle techniques are also used : the development of the repository in such a way that it becomes indispensable to authors in the process of their work and authoring duties which it is hoped will indirectly persuade them of the benefits of placing all their materials in a single location .",
    "the repository is now extremely well - used by cern scientists to the extent that it receives 20,000 unique visitors each month ( staff on site number around 6,000 at any one time ) and over 200,000 searches . in order to maintain this demand",
    "it is important that the service is continually enhanced to integrate with new services and match the expectations created by new technical possibilities in the information environment .",
    "such repository enhancements are explained further in this article .",
    "the deluge of digital information experienced by the digital world in the past decade has created a need for transparent and effective means of data organization and mining . within the digital library environment",
    ", metadata has become the core component for document reposition and dissemination .",
    "accurate , intelligible and rich metadata helps the pinpointing of library objects within an archive as well as across federated search engines : it is found that libraries favour hosting metadata - rich objects , thus improving the long - term access and preservation via replication at multiple sites .    at cern ,",
    "the metadata format of choice is marcxml , a flexible , extensible format which perfectly accommodates the needs of describing heterogeneous and complex library objects . in the case of manuscripts and articles -",
    "the predominant object type in the cds - there exists a set of basic metadata tags ( such as author , title , year , etc . ) that are essential in order to store the object in the archive ; these are usually directly input by the author upon submission or are acquired through an oai - compliant harvest and subsequently checked by library cataloguers . at this point of the data acquisition process ,",
    "certain tools are evoked which attempt to transcend the basic set of metadata tags by automatically extracting additional information from the document s fulltext . at the moment",
    "these tools typically perform automatic keywording and reference extraction .",
    "although a detailed account of these procedures is beyond the scope of this paper , an outline of their basic _ modus operandi _ gives an idea of their relevance to the overall organisation and usefulness of the repository . for more information see @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the automatic keyword extraction aims at producing a set of keywords that describe the fundamental concepts of a document .",
    "the enrichment of metadata with controlled , subject - specific terms aids document cataloging and indexing . in this perspective",
    ", cern is developing in conjunction with the desy library a taxonomy of high energy physics to be used with an automatic classification system .",
    "the taxonomy , expressed in skos syntax , a dialect of rdf and xml markup languages , contains more than 2500 basic terms and is implemented with more than 15000 keyword combinations and key - chains , to satisfy the needs and the classification methods sought by this specific scientific community . by using a powerful phrase - matching mechanism on top of this semantically - rich , well - structured knowledge base , we are able to perform accurate assignment of controlled indexes to the documents in the archive based on keyword occurrence and similar algorithms . a typical output obtained with such a system",
    "is shown in table  1 .",
    "the benefit provided by such metadata enhancement is two - fold : first , the controlled terms automatically generated provide extra cataloging information on top of author and library indexes - a clear added value ; second , the taxonomy allows for the specification of relations and hierarchies , so that the metadata generated can be used to automatically create clusters of similar documents and refine search capabilities .",

    "the information retrieved is then used to enhance the metadata and produce bibliometric evaluations such as those described in section [ usage ] the methodology used at cern consists of three steps :    1 .   the detection and extraction of the reference section from the full text 2 .",
    "the recognition of single citation entries 3 .",
    "the reformulation to standard and accurate citation format and thus the linking to the cited sources    the first step involves some text - parsing methods to isolate the portion of the document that contains bibliographic information .",
    "once this has been localised , the style and structure of the bibliography is interpreted .",
    "this involves recognising every single citation entry and for each one , reconstructing its bibliographic information such as title , author , report number and internet address . in order to improve the quality and accuracy of the output , the reference extraction operates on top of a knowledge base which contains alternative forms of scientific journal names and report numbers .",
    "an excerpt of a sample knowledge base is depicted in table  2 . by using this information",
    ", the system tries to match the author - created citation entry with a known on - line journal volume and thus uses the publisher s system of url creation to automatically generate a working url , linking back to the cited source .",

    "the types of social tools currently offered on a large scale include services for social editing ( wikis ) , basket management , open content evaluation and user interaction ( forums and message - boards ) .",
    "the benefits of adopting a collaborative infrastructure on top of a digital library system are numerous , yet the essence of the service is unique : to provide a social environment in which users and communities interact with each other and actively participate in the management of digital content .    in the field of high energy physics ,",
    "the dissemination of scientific results among communities of researchers and academics has relied enormously in the past decade on the free circulation of electronic preprints and articles in specialised subject repositories , such as arxiv.org and spires .",
    "although the importance and role of these large open archives remain invaluable , they still lack the dynamism offered by a user - centered , co - operative setting . the cern library and document server teams",
    "have therefore been increasingly interested in implementing a set of social tools into the institutional repository , to allow a higher degree of user interaction and active participation among the scientific community .",
    "some of the services that are currently being deployed or are already in use are a ) automatic user notification , b ) basket and collection management and c ) content rating and evaluation .",
    "the automatic notification is a service intended for users that wish to be alerted whenever the repository is updated with certain documents .",
    "notifications can enormously aid the localisation of specific types of material , as users can set up very highly defined alerts based on the output of particular searches .",
    "such a system provides a useful service not only to the users who wish to receive updates , but also to the authors whose material becomes more visible to a specific intended audience .",
    "the notifications are currently in the form of emails , sent upon request to the user , although an atom / rss feed facility will be available in the near future .",
    "basket and collection management is a groupware feature that was recently developed mainly to satisfy the business needs of companies in _ e_-commerce .",
    "it has now rapidly evolved and become popular among many other user - oriented web services such as document , photo and music archives .",
    "this feature allows users and groups of users to collect digital library objects into organised baskets and collections and thus share their content with the broader community . as with user notification ,",
    "this particular social feature improves the visibility of digital objects and facilitates their reuse and dissemination by allowing the export of baskets in bibliographic formats ( bibtex ) and a variety of web feeds .",
    "the rating and evaluation of digital library content is undoubtedly the most influential , yet controversial , social feature which will be offered to cds users .",
    "the basic concept is to allow open discussion and review of all archived content .",
    "this paradigm , already extensively used in non - academic domains such as music , books and movie review services , is struggling to gain wide acceptance from the academic and scientific communities whose research evaluation channels have been historically bound to traditional peer reviewing methods , published letters and private communication . in the cds prototype , all users are allowed to review a library object , rate it and comment on other user reviews , thus opening active discussion and interaction in a message - board fashion . in an attempt to reduce the misuse ,",
    "all users can also report malicious submissions at any time  to allow human interception .",
    "the introduction of an open document review and rating scheme in the cds repository is not intended to discrown the validity and efficiency of peer review , but rather provide an increased level of feedback and review in parallel to the traditional evaluation and commenting methods . moreover ,",
    "the formal presence of such a system may prove to be an incentive for more authors to deposit their preprints and obtain immediate feedback on their research work .      for many reasons researchers , as authors and as readers , need the attribution of quality indicators to articles . defining such",
    "quality has always been a challenge and the problem of evaluating archive content in an objective , unbiased , fashion is therefore not new .",
    "traditionally , quality has been assigned simply by screening through peer - review in combination with the measured impact of the journal , based on its referring component , i.e. the analysis of the scientific publications that cite it . although the procedure of collecting such bibliographic information was originally performed only to aid information retrieval , commercial _",
    "ad hoc _ services , most notably the isi science citation index , have increasingly been used to determine the numbers of citations , and by implication the popularity and impact of journals , articles and authors .",
    "the availability of preprint and other author - disseminated versions of articles , sometimes without publication information attached , adds a new dimension to the problem of accurately measuring impact by citations .",
    "conversely , the electronic era offers new possibilities for measuring access to , and usage of , an item .",
    "the definition of usage can therefore be expanded leading to new formulae for expressing an item s popularity and quality.    in the digital era , such evaluation mechanisms have found large - scale adoption , e.g. google s pagerank that weights and ranks a webpage based on an analysis of external hyperlinks that point to it , and the university of southampton s citebase that maintains an open citation index of oa on - line literature . at cern",
    ", a similar infrastructure is being worked on by extracting bibliographic information from all publications in the repository ( as explained in section 4.1 ) and building a networked citation index .",
    "the advantages of such an on - line open system , compared to traditional commercial indexes are many : a ) indexes are based on the whole collection present in the archive , not a subset of the world s leading journals , b ) the availability of bibliographic information within a digital library s metadata can be easily used to generate more complex reports and ranking methods , e.g. co - citation , c ) it is freely available , and authors are encouraged to self - archive their material to get a feel for their citation impact .    the fact that full - text files of most physics publications are nowadays deposited in archives in digital formats , allows yet another method to evaluate the importance of research literature : usage . at cds ,",
    "usage analysis is performed by examining the server access logs in order to produce a ) quantitative reports , such as `` most viewed '' or `` most downloaded '' articles , and b ) automatic recommendation reports , such as `` people who viewed this article also viewed '' .",
    "this statistical information , already largely adopted in non - scientific domains , is rapidly acquiring consensus from the scientific community @xcite .",
    "the cds service is a central part of many particle physicists academic lives . through enhanced searches and alerts , by clicking increasing numbers of relevant links , then by storing and sharing the resulting output , the communication of research results has been dramatically improved .",
    "although the physics preprint repository network offers free access to a very large proportion of the published material in the field , the community still relies on the publication system for validation of the final output . rather than reinvent this system through the repositories , the community at cern has expressed a preference for finding a way to transform publication into an oa system whereby the costs are moved from the readers to the authors who pay for the validation of their work .",
    "repositories and oa publication , have always been seen by the oa community as complementary paths .",
    "with such a set - up it becomes possible to offer the finished articles to readers for no charge and to better integrate the articles into the repositories .",
    "the report of the task force on open access publishing in particle physics@xcite and the potential new models that it proposes are currently in discussion .    for cern ,",
    "the start of the lhc era offers a perfect opportunity to launch into this new area of oa publication . the lhc ",
    "large hadron collider  is the new accelerator being built at cern and which is due to be completed in 2007 .",
    "once it is running , a new generation of physicists will begin their experiments and analysis , and along with the discoveries will come a large increase in the numbers of publications .",
    "it is hoped that the new physics can be accompanied by a new era of publishing ",
    "one in which the results of the research are free to all and not limited only to those who continue to afford the journal subscriptions .",
    "co - operation will continue with the traditional publishers in the field , and discussions should naturally lead on to new possibilities concerning open data , and perhaps repository overlay journals which could lead to quite radical changes in the way scientists prepare their publications .    whilst the oa movement is growing in recognition and acceptance ,",
    "scholarly communication is under the microscope as never before , and interest in repositories is becoming an international library phenomenom . increasing numbers of technical developers of repositories and thinkers behind the oa movement are emerging and generating new ideas .",
    "the cern team has tried to realign its own direction with that of the worldwide movement and has also tried to keep a strong focus on innovation and experimentation .",
    "it is now an exciting time both for repository development and for the scholarly communication environment .",
    "cern s position as a current leader in particle physics research , places it well , at least in its own field , for leading a change in the protocols for scholarly communication ."
