    "xb1746 - 371 is one of the group of @xmath210 low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) exhibiting x - ray dipping at the orbital period , generally accepted as being due to absorption in the bulge in the outer accretion disc .",
    "these sources provide substantially more diagnostics and information on the geometry , size and properties of the x - ray emission regions than non - dipping sources .",
    "firstly , there is strong , complex , spectral evolution in dipping ; a successful emission model must be able to realistically fit spectra selected in intensity bands through the dips , as well as the non - dip spectrum . in recent years ,",
    "all of the dipping sources have been fitted by a model consisting of pointlike blackbody emission from the surface of the neutron star which causes fast variability in dipping , plus comptonized emission from an extended accretion disc corona ( adc ) ( bauciska - church et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ; church et al .",
    "1997 , 1998a , 1998b ; smale , church & bauciska - church 2001 , 2002 ) .",
    "secondly , the technique of dip ingress timing allows measurement of the size of extended emission regions , when overlapped by an absorber of larger angular size .",
    "this reveals that the adc is very large , of radial extent @xmath3 typically 50,000 km , and that @xmath3 increases with source luminosity ( church & bauciska - church 2003 ) such that in the brightest dipping source x1624 - 490 , @xmath3 becomes 700,000 km , or 65 per cent of the radius of the accretion disc .",
    "thirdly , long - term monitoring of the light curves of the dipping sources may reveal evolution in the orbital period , or other effects .",
    "this is the case in the source xb1916 - 053 having an x - ray period of @xmath23000 s , 1 per cent shorter than the optical period ( chou , grindlay & bloser 2001 ; homer et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the case of xbt0748 - 676 ,",
    "timing studies have been aided by the observation of almost complete x - ray eclipses ( parmar et al .",
    "1986 ) by the companion star .",
    "xb1746 - 371 is a medium brightness member of the dipping lmxb class in the core of the globular cluster ngc6441 ( giacconi et al .",
    "1974 ; clark et al . 1974",
    "; grindlay et al . 1976 ; jernigan & clark 1979 ; hertz & grindlay 1983 ) .",
    "dipping was discovered by parmar , stella & giommi ( 1989 ) in an _ exosat _ observation indicating a period 5.0@xmath10.5 hr .",
    "these dips had a depth of only 15 per cent in the band 1  10 kev , and x - ray bursts were also detected ( sztajno et al .",
    "sansom et al .",
    "( 1993 ) used _ ginga _ data to find an orbital period of 5.73@xmath10.15 hr .",
    "more recently , jonker et al .",
    "( 2000 ) discovered a 1 hz quasi - periodic oscillation , present during persistent emission and bursts , using _",
    "an observation with _ bepposax _ confirmed that dipping was apparently energy - independent as seen in _ exosat _",
    "( parmar et al .",
    "1999 ) , as is also the case in another dipping source x1755 - 338 ( white et al .",
    "1984 ; mason , parmar & white 1985 ;         the _ bepposax _ data implied an orbital period of @xmath4 hr .",
    "in this paper we derive an orbital period for xb1746 - 371 using _ rxte _",
    "observations performed in 2002 january and may , and refine this period using prior _ rxte _ observations made in 1996 october and 1998 june  november .",
    "we also re - examine archival data from _ exosat _ and _ rxte _ and show that the new period is consistent with these observations .",
    "our period is inconsistent with the _ ginga _ period , and is closer to the original determination by parmar et al .",
    "in a further paper , we will present results for spectral evolution during dipping and flaring .",
    "we observed  with _ rxte _ ( bradt et al .",
    "1993 ) from 2002 , january 16 ut 22:42:35 to january 20 ut 21:45:15 ( observation i d 60044 - 02 - 0100 ; and from may 3 ut 14:22:08 to may 8 ut 16:15:15 ( 60044 - 02 - 02 - 00 ) .",
    "the observations span nearly 4 and 5 days , respectively .",
    "results presented here use data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) operating in standard 2 mode with 16 s time resolution .",
    "the pca consists of five xe proportional counter units , numbered 04 , with a combined effective area of about 6500 @xmath5 ( jahoda et al .",
    "pcus 0 and 2 were reliably on during most of the observations , and we use these pcus in the following .",
    "the propane layer of pcu0 had failed at the start of epoch 5 ( defined as 2000 , may 13 ) , however , this does not appreciably affect the light curves presented here .",
    "light curves and spectra were extracted using the standard _ rxte _",
    "analysis software ftools 5.2 .",
    "standard screening was applied to select only data with an offset of the telescope pointing axis from the source less than 0.02@xmath6 , and an elevation above the earth s limb @xmath7 10@xmath6 .",
    "the source was bright during both observations , with count rates exceeding 40 c s@xmath8 per pcu , and thus the background was calculated using the program pcabackest with the latest version of the `` bright '' background model for epoch 5 appropriate to the observations released in january , 2002 .",
    "the energy band used , 2.1  16.0 kev , was selected by comparison of the spectra of the source + background and the background . at 16 kev",
    "the background was two times smaller than the source + background , and data were not used at energies greater than this , where the spectra were converging due to the increase of background with energy .",
    "the background subtracted light curves of the 2002 january and may observations are shown in fig .",
    "1 . both observations reveal dipping with an intensity reduction of 25 per cent .",
    "a total of 4 x - ray bursts can be seen , one of which is double .",
    "the peak height of the bursts is reduced substantially by the binning which is comparable with the total burst duration .",
    "in addition , there are periods of x - ray flaring in which the intensity increases by 30 per cent for several thousand seconds . inspection of light curves in various sub - bands confirmed that dipping was evident in all energy bands , whereas flaring was only visible above @xmath25 kev .",
    "flaring is well - known in the bright z - track lmxb sources that are approaching the eddington limit .",
    "however , the luminous dipping source x1624 - 490 also exhibits strong flaring dominating the light curve above 8 kev , and the spectral evolution suggests marked changes on the neutron star and at the inner disc ( bauciska - church et al .",
    "we have also detected similar flaring in the dipping source xb1254 - 490 ( smale et al .",
    "2002 ) . in general ,",
    "x - ray bursting is observed in faint sources , and x - ray flaring in bright sources , so observation of both in the present observation is unusual and presumably reflects the intermediate luminosity of the source .",
    "spectral fitting a non - dip , non - burst , non - flare spectrum gave a 1  30 kev luminosity of @xmath9 erg s@xmath8 for a distance of 9.0 kpc ( christian & swank 1997 ) .",
    "this is indeed intermediate when compared with x1624 - 490 ( above ) with a non - flaring luminosity of @xmath10  @xmath11",
    "erg s@xmath8 in _ bepposax _ and _ rxte _ observations ( bauciska - church et al . 2000 , 2001 ) ( for a distance of 15 kpc christian & swank 1997 ) , and with typical burst sources such as xb1323 - 619 ( barnard et al . 2001 ) with luminosities of a few @xmath12 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "the orbital period in xb1746 - 371 was obtained by a two - stage process . in the first stage",
    ", we obtained the power spectrum of the light curve for each observation in the band 2.1  3.7 kev . in this band",
    "dipping was as strong as in any other band , but flaring was absent , so that spurious peaks in the power spectrum were avoided .",
    "the x - ray bursts were also removed from the data to prevent these contaminating the power spectrum .",
    "next , a technique was used to prevent spurious peaks in the power spectrum due to the data gaps caused by earth occultation and south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) passage .",
    "a modified light curve was made in which real data was given an intensity of unity , and zeroes written into the data gaps . from this , a window function of the data gaps was obtained which allowed the cleaned spectrum to be obtained by deconvolution of the uncleaned power spectrum and the window function ( roberts , lehr & dreher 1987 ) .",
    "this was done using the clean alogorithm of the period program which is part of the starlink packages .",
    "the incomplete coverage of individual dips did not justify modelling the dip shape to establish the dip centre more accurately .",
    "the data were also detrended , although this had little effect on the results .    in principle , a period determination might be made by fitting both observations simultaneously .",
    "however , it can be seen from fig .",
    "1 that the january observation constrains the orbital period well , as there are two clear dips towards the start of the observation , and a clear dip close to the end , whereas the second observation only has clear dipping at the start , and these data do not constrain the orbital period well .",
    "we therefore obtain the orbital period from the first observation , and then confirm that this period predicts dipping at times observed in the second observation ( below ) . the power spectrum of the first observation is presented in fig .",
    "2 .",
    "a strong peak is observed at a frequency ( @xmath13 in fig .",
    "2 ) of @xmath14 s@xmath8 corresponding to a period of 5.12 hr .",
    "the uncertainty in this value was obtained by the method of schwarzenberg - czerny ( 1991 ) using the power spectrum linewidth .",
    "this is done by measuring the power of the noise in the neighbourhood of the main peak and obtaining the half - width of the line at a depth of the noise power below the peak which is the 1@xmath15 uncertainty . in this case , this gave a half - width in frequency of @xmath16 hz . however ,",
    "this is smaller than the frequency binning in fig .",
    "2 ( optimised in the power spectrum program ) which has a half - width of @xmath17 hz and so we use this to give the uncertainty in the period of 5.12@xmath10.035 hr . there is also a peak ( @xmath18 ) at a frequency twice @xmath13 , suggesting that interdipping takes place between the main dips , so that two dips occur in each orbital cycle .",
    "the remaining peaks are all small , and most of them are consistent with beating between @xmath13 or @xmath18 and the frequencies of earth occultation and saa passage which are related to the 90-minute orbital period of the satellite .",
    "the period obtained from _ ginga _ is indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "2 , showing that there is no power at this frequency .",
    "our period determination was then refined by cycle counting techniques using two prior observations of xb1746 - 371 .",
    "light curves were produced for these observations in the same way as for the data presented above .",
    "the first of these , made in 1996 october , was a long observation lasting 600  ks during which clear dipping was observed near the start of the observation at @xmath19 = 4000 s and near the end at @xmath19 = 579840 s. using the 5.12-hr period we can deduce that 31 cycles elapsed between these dipping episodes , and based on this cycle count , we obtain a period of 5.16 hr . it can be seen that the uncertainty of @xmath10.035 hr accumulates over 31 cycles to 1.09 hr which is 21 per cent of the cycle .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that an error has been made in the cycle count .",
    "a second observation made in 1998 consisted of 4 sub - observations spaced over 6 months . in each of the second and third sub - observations",
    "there was one very well - defined dip with a deep sharp minimum ( other observed dips were not well - defined ) .",
    "the time separation of these dips was 8317920  s , which for a period of 5.16 hr gives a cycle count of 447.8 .",
    "the uncertainty in locating dipping due to the time binning of 16 s gives a negligible error in the period .",
    "however , from the three observations used to refine the period , we estimate a period error of @xmath20.01 hr . using the implied span of periods between 5.15 and 5.17 hr gives counts of 448.6 and 446.9 , respectively , i.e. the count is 448@xmath11 .",
    "conversely , counts of 449 and 447 correspond to periods of 5.15 and 5.17 hr .",
    "thus we can not be certain that there is not an error of one in the count and so obtain from the above timespan and count a period of 5.15(7)@xmath10.01 hr .    finally , we repeated this procedure using the two observations performed in 2002 .",
    "the time separation between the lowest intensity point in the last dip in the january observation and the lowest point in the first dip in the may observation was 8923424 s. using a period of 5.16 hr , this gives a cycle count of 480.37 for this separation .",
    "for a cycle count of 480 , we obtain a period of 5.16(4 ) hr .",
    "thus , we derive a consistent value of the period using 3 observations of 5.16@xmath1 0.01 hr .    this value of the period was then tested against several light curves as follows . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the present observations and compare the actual dipping with the predicted dip centers based on a period of 5.16 hr ( lower arrows ) .",
    "we also show the dip centers expected from the _ ginga _ period of 5.73 hr ( upper arrows ) . for both periods ,",
    "the first arrow is aligned with the first dip in each observation .",
    "it is clear that the 5.16-hr period gives very good alignment with the dips observed . in the second observation ( 2002 may )",
    ", there is a possible dip at @xmath20 s which is not well - aligned with an arrow .",
    "however , the previous dip is at @xmath21 s which is 7.77 hr from the possible dip .",
    "thus it is likely that this is not a real dip but part of a trend of general intensity decrease that can be seen in the latter part of the observation .",
    "the 5.16-hr period was also tested against the light curve of the _ exosat _ observation of 1985 september 9 , and gave good alignment .",
    "finally , the two additional _ rxte _ observations of 1996 and 1998 used above to refine the period were tested , and good alignment of dipping with the period obtained .",
    "in figure 4 we present the data from the 2002 january rxte observation folded on the best - fit period , together with the corresponding folded hardness ratio , where the hardness is defined as the ratio of the count rates in the 9.8  16.0 kev and 2.1  3.7 kev bands .",
    "the dipping is seen clearly in the folded light curve , with some indication of interdipping between the main dips .",
    "the folded hardness ratio confirms that dipping is largely energy independent , as was previously known from the _ exosat _ and _ bepposax _ observations ( parmar et al .",
    "1989 , 1999 ) . because flaring may persist during dipping",
    ", we can not say whether the small change in hardness in the dip is due to dipping or to flaring .",
    "the long observations that we made with _",
    "rxte _ have allowed us to derive an improved orbital period of 5.16@xmath10.01  hr for xb1746 - 371 .",
    "comparison with previous orbital period determinations shows that the _ exosat _ value of @xmath22 hr ( parmar et al .",
    "1989 ) is consistent with our present result , as is the _ bepposax _ period of @xmath4 hr ( parmar et al .",
    "1999 ) , but the _ ginga _ value of @xmath23 hr ( sansom et al .",
    "1993 ) is not .",
    "this is also apparent from fig . 2 where the _ ginga _ value corresponding to a frequency of @xmath24 s@xmath8 lies well to the side of the strongest peak .",
    "inspection of figs .",
    "3 and 4 also shows that the _ ginga _ period is inconsistent with the present data . in the 2002 january observation",
    ", the _ ginga _ period fails to align with the dipping at @xmath25 s , or at @xmath26 s , although the arrows are coincidentally aligned with dipping in between these times ( at @xmath27 s ) .",
    "we note that dipping in the _ ginga _ data was much less pronounced than in the present observations , making the period more difficult to determine .",
    "xb1746 - 371 is unusual in displaying energy - independent dipping , as does one other dipping source , x1755 - 338 ( white et al .",
    "1984 ; mason et al . 1985 ; church & bauciska - church 1993 ) . in the case of the _ exosat _",
    "observation of xb1746 - 371 , parmar et al .",
    "( 1989 ) examined possible causes of energy independence , including an ionized absorber .",
    "the _ bepposax _",
    "observation again revealed energy independence in dipping , and parmar et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ruled out possible causes such as an ionized absorber , very low metallicity ( reduced by 130 times from solar ) , and also the explanation for x1755 - 338 of church & bauciska - church ( 1993 ) in which two spectral components combine to give approximate energy independence .",
    "we will investigate the spectral evolution during the dips in the present _ rxte _ data in a further paper .",
