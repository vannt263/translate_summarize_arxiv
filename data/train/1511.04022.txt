    "the physics of such a magnetic rigid rotor is very rich specially at mesoscopic scales where the einstein - de haas effect is enhanced due to a smaller moment of inertia .",
    "quantum effects have to be considered  @xcite when thermal fluctuations of the degrees of freedom are small .",
    "the quantum mechanical theory of the rigid rotor has been applied to study rotational spectra of molecules  @xcite , to model the structure of the atomic nucleus  @xcite , and to control the rotational motion of molecules  @xcite .",
    "magnetic rigid rotors in the quantum regime have been considered to study spin tunneling in single molecule magnets and magnetic single - domain nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the possibility to bring mesoscopic systems to the quantum regime , see @xcite and references therein , here we use well known results in quantum angular momentum theory  @xcite to develop a theoretical toolbox to describe the quantum dynamics of a levitated magnetic rigid rotor .",
    "we consider a single - domain magnetic nanoparticle ( we call it nanomagnet hereafter ) in a magnetic trap to derive , from first principles , a relatively simple quadratic hamiltonian able to describe the rich dynamics of the system . an experimental proposal to bring a levitated nanomagnet in the quantum regime will be analyzed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in",
    "we introduce the system , its degrees of freedom , the basic hamiltonian in the lab and body frame , and the hilbert space with the relevant basis . in",
    "we perform a unitary transformation that diagonalizes the magnetic dipole interaction term . in",
    "we perform the lamb - dicke approximation by assuming the nanomagnet to be tighly confined in the magnetic trap . in we show how to map the angular momentum operators of the hamlitonian into bosonic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "this allows us to perform a holstein - primakov approximation by assuming the nanomagnet to be well anti - aligned to the external magnetic field and nearly not rotating . in",
    "we apply these approximations to derive a quadratic hamiltonian and discuss its validity . in",
    "we draw our conclusions and provide some further directions .",
    "we leave to the appendices the discussion of some required tools of quantum angular momentum theory ( ) , an example of magnetic field trap ( ) , and some details about the derivation of the quadratic hamiltonian ( & [ apdx : nonadiabaticterms ] ) .",
    "we consider a nanomagnet of mass @xmath0 , moment of inertia @xmath1 , and magnetic moment @xmath2 .",
    "the nanomagnet is interacting in free space with an external static b - field @xmath3 .",
    "being a rigid body , the position of the nanomagnet in space is specified by its center of mass position and its orientation .",
    "the latter is equivalent to specifying the orientation of the coordinate frame @xmath4 , attached to the body and centered at the position of its center of mass , with respect to the position of the coordinate frame @xmath5 fixed in the laboratory .",
    "the mutual orientation between the two frames is described through the euler angles @xmath6 defined in a. hereafter latin indexes @xmath7 label the body frame axis while greek indexes @xmath8 label the laboratory frame axes .",
    "the nanomagnet is characterized by the following degrees of freedom , see fig .",
    "[ fig : euler_angles]b :    * the center of mass described by its position @xmath9 and momentum @xmath10 . * the rotational momentum and orientation of the particle described by the angular momentum @xmath11 and the euler angles @xmath12 .",
    "* the magnetic moment @xmath2 .",
    "the operator @xmath11 is the angular momentum associated to the rotational motion of the particle .",
    "the magnetic moment of the nanomagnet @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , is the sum of the single magnetic moments of its @xmath15 constituents , where @xmath16 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath17 the total spin of the @xmath18th constituent .",
    "the individual spins inside the nanomagnet are subjected to two different interactions : ( i ) the exchange interaction , that tends to align all the single magnetic moments together , and ( ii ) the anisotropy interaction , that tends to align independently each magnetic moment to a given direction in the crystalline structure of the particle .",
    "when the first one dominates the second ( weak anisotropy limit ) one can perform the so - called macrospin approximation   @xcite , which consists in projecting the total spin into the subspace with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total spin of a single constituent ( assumed to be identical for simplificity ) .",
    "finally , note that the center - of - mass motion , described by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , can yield angular momentum @xmath21 .",
    "this should not be confused with @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamics of a rigid body can be studied both in the laboratory frame @xmath5 and in the body frame @xmath4 . in the laboratory frame , the dynamics of a spherical nanomagnet of radius @xmath22 ( moment of inertia @xmath23 ) is described by the hamiltonian [ eq : ham_lab ] = + ^2 -^2d ^2 - ( ) .",
    "note that when a non - spherical shape is considered , the moment of inertia will be a tensor depending on the euler angles @xcite .",
    "the first ( second ) term represents the kinetic energy of the center of mass ( rotational ) motion .",

    "moreover , we assume @xmath33=0 , \\,\\forall \\mu,\\nu$ ] , namely that the spin angular momentum is independent of the euler angles .",
    "this is commonly assumed in molecular quantum mechanics @xcite , and corresponds to neglecting the spin - orbit interaction between the individual spins of the nanomagnet and the electronic rotational motion within the born - oppenheimer approximation .",

    "should one also be interested in describing the magnetic coupling of the nanomagnet with the quantum electromagnetic field , one could just add the quantized magnetic field operator to the magnetic dipole interaction term in the very initial hamiltonian .",
    "this could be used to calculate vacuum forces and decay rates of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "also note that the derivation of the quadratic hamiltonian is constructive in the sense that one could consider next orders in both the lamb - dicke and the holstein - primakoff expansion to obtain the higher order non - quadratic contributions .",
    "the derived quadratic hamiltonian can be handled with the usual techniques of quantum optics and describes a very rich and original physical system .",

    "this coupling can be used to cool the center - of - mass motion to the ground state as well as to sympathetically cool the rotational angular momentum and the macroscopin degrees of freedom ; ( ii ) the proposal and study of magnetically levitating the nanomagnet using the meissner field induced on a superconductive film with a hole  @xcite .",
    "this permanent passive short - distance trap could be used to measure casimir and short - distance gravitational forces ; ( iii ) once in the quantum regime , exploit the nanomagnet as a nano - gyroscope ; ( iv ) perform matter - wave interferometry by releasing the ground - state cooled nanomagnet from the trap ; ( v ) explore the regimes where the non - gaussian physics given by the non - quadratic terms are relevant , for instance in the context of superradiance effects , etc .",
