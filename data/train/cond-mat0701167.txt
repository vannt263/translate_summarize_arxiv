    "among the electronic hamiltonians relevant for interacting systems the hubbard model @xcite is considered as one that contains the essential ingredients for understanding the physics of correlated electrons . in a many - body system the relevant physics is encoded in the symmetries and in the hubbard model they are represented by the charge u(1 ) gauge and spin rotational su(2 ) groups relevant for the occurrence of the superconducting and magnetic orderings .",
    "interestingly , the resulting u(2)=u(1)@xmath0su(2 ) symmetry group has a nontrivial multiply connected topological structure . for multiply connected configuration spaces novel features can arise as for example in the aharonov - bhm effect @xcite governed by the multiply connected u(1 ) group manifold .",
