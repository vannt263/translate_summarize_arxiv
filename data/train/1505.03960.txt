    "then there is an @xmath34-lipschitz domain @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "the above proposition has a few applications .",
    "firstly , it gives an even shorter proof that semmes surfaces are uniformly rectifiable as follows : let @xmath31 and @xmath65 , pick an interior corkscrew @xmath66 .",
    "observe that if @xmath39 is the connected component of @xmath45 containing @xmath23 , then @xmath39 is an exterior corkscrew domain as each ball centered on @xmath27 must have two corkscrew balls in two different components of @xmath45 , and so one of them ca nt be @xmath39 .",

    "badger proves something similar in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) .",
    "he observed that the proof in david and jerison gives a version of proposition [ p : main ] if we just assume the boundary is locally @xmath7-finite rather than ahlfors regular .",
    "his result gives a bit more information , but he needs both interior and exterior corkscrews for his domains .    the additional motivation for finding _ interior _ big pieces of lipschitz domains aside from uniform rectifiability is a result of dahlberg @xcite , which says that harmonic measures on lipschitz domains are @xmath73-weights . using a version of proposition [ p : main ] , david and jerison showed harmonic measure is an @xmath73-weight if @xmath39 has ahlfors regular boundary and is a nontangentially accessible ( or nta ) domain , which happen to be connected corkscrew domains .",
    "( we wo nt discuss the definition of an nta domain and refer the reader to its inception in @xcite . )",
    "badger in turn shows that @xmath74 ( @xmath75 denoting harmonic measure ) if we only assume @xmath76 is radon .",
    "one can now use the above proposition and proceed as on page 842 of @xcite or as in section 4 of @xcite to obtain shorter proofs of these harmonic measure results .",
    "the common thread in our proofs of theorem [ t : mw ] and proposition [ p : main ] is to use fubini s theorem to show that if a portion of @xmath77 , say , has large projections in several directions , then there must be a set @xmath27 of points in @xmath77 of large measure which are `` visible '' from a positive measure set of directions ( that is , for each @xmath31 there are line segments emanating from @xmath11 in many directions without hitting @xmath60 ) .",
    "we then show that , for each @xmath31 , the set of directions are dense enough around one particular direction that in fact there is a whole spherical cap of directions that @xmath11 is visible from ( since if one of those rays did hit the boundary , we would find an exterior corkscrew that would have to block one of these directions ) .",
    "thus , @xmath11 is the apex of a cone contained in @xmath39 .",
    "from here it is not too hard to show that a large portion of @xmath27 lies in the boundary of a lipschitz domain .",

    "<S> in a recent paper , csrnyei and wilson prove that curves in euclidean space of @xmath0-finite length have tangents on a set of positive @xmath1-measure . </S>",
    "<S> they also show that a higher dimensional analogue of this result is not possible without some additional assumptions . in this note , we show that if @xmath2 has the property that each ball centered on @xmath3 contains two large balls in different components of @xmath4 and @xmath3 has @xmath0-finite @xmath5-measure , then it has @xmath6-dimensional tangent points in a set of positive @xmath7-measure . </S>",
    "<S> we also give shorter proofs that semmes surfaces are uniformly rectifiable and , if @xmath8 is an exterior corkscrew domain whose boundary has locally finite @xmath5-measure , one can find a lipschitz subdomain intersecting a large portion of the boundary . </S>"
