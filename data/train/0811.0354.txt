    "black holes are one of the fundamental predictions of general relativity . at the same time , they are one of its least understood ( and most often misunderstood ) aspects .",
    "these lectures intend to introduce the black hole concept and the analysis of waves on black hole backgrounds @xmath1 by means of the example of the scalar wave equation @xmath2    we do not assume the reader is familiar with general relativity , only basic analysis and differential geometry . in this introductory section ,",
    "we briefly describe general relativity in outline form , taking from the beginning the evolutionary point of view which puts the cauchy problem for the _ einstein equations_the system of nonlinear partial differential equations ( see @xmath3 below ) governing the theory  at the centre . the problem @xmath4 can be viewed as a poor man s linearisation for the einstein equations .",
    "study of @xmath4 is then intimately related to the problem of the dynamic stability of the black hole spacetimes @xmath1 themselves .",
    "thus , one should view the subject of these lectures as intimately connected to the very tenability of the black hole concept in the theory .",
    "general relativity postulates a @xmath5-dimensional lorentzian manifold @xmath6_space - time_which is to satisfy the _",
    "einstein equations _",
    "@xmath7 here , @xmath8 , @xmath9 denote the _ ricci _ and _ scalar _ curvature of @xmath10 , respectively , and @xmath11 denotes a symmetric @xmath12-tensor on @xmath13 termed the _ stress - energy - momentum tensor _ of matter .",
    "( necessary background on lorentzian geometry to understand the above notation is given in appendix  [ lorge ] . )",
    "the equations @xmath3 in of themselves do not close , but must be coupled to `` matter equations '' satisfied by a collection @xmath14 of matter fields defined on @xmath13 , together with a constitutive relation determining @xmath11 from @xmath15 .",
    "these equations and relations are stipulated by the relevant continuum field theory ( electromagnetism , fluid dynamics , etc . )  describing the matter .",
    "the formulation of general relativity represents the culmination of the classical field - theoretic world - view where physics is governed by a closed system of partial differential equations .",
    "einstein was led to the system @xmath3 in 1915 , after a @xmath16-year struggle to incorporate gravity into his earlier principle of relativity . in the field - theoretic formulation of the `` newtonian '' theory ,",
    "gravity was described by the _",
    "newtonian potential _",
    "@xmath17 satisfying the _ poisson equation _",
    "@xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the _ mass - density _ of matter .",
    "it is truly remarkable that the constraints of consistency were so rigid that encorporating gravitation required finally a complete reworking of the principle of relativity , leading to a theory where newtonian gravity , special relativity and euclidean geometry each emerge as limiting aspects of one dynamic geometrical structure  the lorentzian metric  naturally living on a @xmath5-dimensional spacetime continuum .",
    "a second remarkable aspect of general relativity is that , in contrast to its newtonian predecessor , the theory is non - trivial even in the absence of matter . in that case , we set @xmath20 and the system @xmath3 takes the form @xmath21 the equations @xmath22 are known as the _ einstein vacuum equations_. whereas @xmath23 is a linear elliptic equation , @xmath22 can be seen to form a closed system of non - linear ( but _ quasilinear _ ) wave equations",
    ". essentially all of the characteristic features of the dynamics of the einstein equations are already present in the study of the vacuum equations @xmath22 .      to understand a theory like general relativity where the fundamental equations @xmath22 are nonlinear , the first goal often is to identify and study important _ explicit solutions",
    "_ , i.e. , solutions which can be written in closed form .",
    "much of the early history of general relativity centred around the discovery and interpretation of such solutions .",
    "the simplest explicit solution to the einstein vacuum equations @xmath22 is _ minkowski space _ @xmath24 .",
    "the next simplest solution of @xmath22 is the so - called _ schwarzschild solution _ , written down  @xcite already in 1916 .",
    "this is in fact a one - parameter family of solutions @xmath25 , the parameter @xmath26 identified with _",
    "mass_. see  @xmath27 below for the metric form .",
    "the schwarzschild family lives as a subfamily in a larger two - parameter family of explicit solutions @xmath28 known as the _",
    "kerr solutions _ , discussed in section  [ thekerrmetric ] .",
    "these were discovered only much later  @xcite ( 1963 ) .",
    "when the schwarzschild solution was first written down in local coordinates , the necessary concepts to understand its geometry had not yet been developed .",
    "it took nearly 50 years from the time when schwarzschild was first discovered for its global geometry to be sufficiently well understood so as to be given a suitable name : schwarzschild and kerr were examples of what came to be known as _ black hole",
    "_ spacetimes .",
    "the schwarzschild solution also illustrates another feature of the einstein equations , namely , the presence of singularities",
    ".    we will spend section  [ introsec ] telling the story of the emergence of the black hole notion and sorting out what the distinct notions of `` black hole '' and `` singularity '' mean .",
    "for the purpose of the present introductory section , let us take the notion of `` black hole '' as a `` black box '' and make some general remarks on the role of explicit solutions , whatever might be their properties .",
    "these remarks are relevant for any physical theory governed by an evolution equation .",
    "explicit solutions are indeed suggestive as to how general solutions behave , but only if they are appropriately `` stable '' . in general relativity",
    ", this notion can in turn only be understood after the problem of dynamics for @xmath22 has been formulated , that is to say , the _ cauchy problem_.    in contrast to other non - linear field theories arising in physics , in the case of general relativity , even formulating the cauchy problem requires addressing several conceptual issues ( e.g.  in what sense is @xmath22 hyperbolic ? ) , and these took a long time to be correctly sorted out .",
    "important advances in this process include the identification of the harmonic gauge by de donder  @xcite , the existence and uniqueness theorems for general quasilinear wave equations in the 1930 s based on work of friedrichs , schauder , sobolev , petrovsky , leray and others , and leray s notion of global hyperbolicity  @xcite .",
    "the well - posedness of the appropriate cauchy problem for the vacuum equations @xmath22 was finally formulated and proven in celebrated work of choquet - bruhat  @xcite ( 1952 ) and choquet - bruhat ",
    "geroch  @xcite ( 1969 ) .",
    "see appendix  [ cauchyproblem ] for a concise survey of these developments and the precise statement of the existence and uniqueness theorems and some comments on their proof .",
    "in retrospect , much of the confusion in early discussions of the schwarzschild solution can be traced to the lack of a dynamic framework to understand the theory .",
    "it is only in the context of the language provided by  @xcite that one can then formulate the dynamical stability problem and examine the relevance of various explicit solutions .",
    "the stability of minkowski space was first proven in the monumental work of christodoulou and klainerman  @xcite .",
    "see appendix  [ stabsect ] for a formulation of this result .",
    "the dynamical stability of the kerr family as a family of solutions to the cauchy problem for the einstein equations , even restricted to parameter values near schwarzschild , i.e.  @xmath29 , is yet to be understood and poses an important challenge for the mathematical study of general relativity in the coming years .",
    "see section  [ formulation ] for a formulation of this problem .",
    "in fact , even the most basic linear properties of waves ( e.g.  solutions of @xmath4 ) on kerr spacetime backgrounds ( or more generally , backgrounds near kerr ) have only recently been understood . in view of the wave - like features of the einstein equations",
    "@xmath22 ( see in particular appendix  [ harmonic ] ) , this latter problem should be thought of as a prerequisite for understanding the non - linear stability problem",
    ".      the above linear problem will be the main topic of these lectures : we shall here develop from the beginning the study of the linear homogeneous wave equation @xmath4 on fixed black hole spacetime backgrounds @xmath1 .",
    "we have already referred in passing to the content of some of the later sections .",
    "let us give here a complete outline : section  [ introsec ] will introduce the black hole concept and the schwarzschild geometry in the wider context of open problems in general relativity .",
    "section  [ s1 ] will concern the basic boundedness properties for solutions @xmath30 of @xmath4 on schwarzschild exterior backgrounds .",
    "section  [ s2 ] will concern quantitative decay properties for @xmath30 .",
    "section  [ pertsec ] will move on to spacetimes @xmath1 `` near '' schwarzschild , including slowly rotating kerr , discussing boundedness and decay properties for solutions to @xmath4 on such @xmath1 , and ending in section  [ formulation ] with a formulation of the non - linear stability problem for kerr , the open problem which in some sense provides the central motivation for these notes .",
    "section  [ cosmolosec ] will consider the analogues of these problems in spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant @xmath31 , section  [ epilogue ] will give a multiplier - type estimate valid for general non - degenerate killing horizons which quantifies the classical red - shift effect .",
    "the importance of the red - shift effect as a stabilising mechanism for the analysis of waves on black hole backgrounds will be a common theme throughout these lectures .",
    "the notes end with a collection of open problems in section  [ acik ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ dt ] of section  [ pertsec ] as well as all results of section  [ epilogue ] appear in print in these notes for the first time .",
    "the discussion of section  [ newproofofb ] as well as the proof of theorem  [ schdec ] have also been streamlined in comparision with previous presentations .",
    "we have given a guide to background literature in sections  [ comsecs ] ,  [ neocoms ] ,  [ neocoms2 ] and  [ neocoms3 ] .",
    "we have tried to strike a balance in these notes between making the discussion self - containted and providing the necessary background to appreciate the place of the problem  @xmath4 in the context of the current state of the art of the cauchy problem for the einstein equations @xmath3 or @xmath22 and the main open problems and conjectures which will guide this subject in the future .",
    "our solution has been to use the history of the schwarzschild solution as a starting point in section  [ introsec ] for a number of digressions into the study of gravitational collapse , singularities , and the weak and strong cosmic censorship conjectures , deferring , however , formal development of various important notions relating to lorentzian geometry and the well - posedness of the einstein equations to a series of appendices .",
    "we have already referred to these appendices in the text .",
    "the informal nature of section  [ introsec ] should make it clear that the discussion is not intended as a proper survey , but merely to expose the reader to important open problems in the field and point to some references for further study .",
    "the impatient reader is encouraged to move quickly through section  [ introsec ] at a first reading .",
    "the problem  @xmath4 is itself rather self - contained , requiring only basic analysis and differential geometry , together with a good understanding of the black hole spacetimes , in particular , their so - called causal geometry .",
    "the discussion of section  [ introsec ] should be more than enough for the latter , although the reader may want to supplement this with a more general discussion , for instance  @xcite .",
    "these notes accompanied a series of lectures at a summer school on `` evolution equations '' organized by the clay mathematics institute , june ",
    "july 2008 .",
    "the centrality of the evolutionary point of view in general relativity is often absent from textbook discussions .",
    "( see however the recent  @xcite . )",
    "we hope that these notes contribute to the point of view that puts general relativity at the centre of modern developments in partial differential equations of evolution .",
    "practically all concepts in the development of general relativity and much of its history can be told from the point of view of the schwarzschild solution .",
    "we now readily associate this solution with the black hole concept .",
    "it is important to remember , however , that the schwarzschild solution was first discovered in a thoroughly classical astrophysical setting : it was to represent the vacuum region outside a star .",
    "the black hole interpretation  though in some sense inevitable  historically only emerged much later .    the most efficient way to present",
    "the schwarzschild solution is to begin at the onset with kruskal s maximal extension as a point of departure .",
    "instead , we shall take advantage of the informal nature of the present notes to attempt a more conversational and `` historical '' presentation of the schwarzschild metric and its interpretation .",
    "although certainly not the quickest route , this approach has the advantage of highlighting the themes which have become so important in the subject  in particular , singularities , black holes and their event horizons  with the excitement of their step - by - step unravelling from their origin in a model for the simplest of general relativistic stars .",
    "the schwarzschild solution will naturally lead to discussions of the oppenheimer - snyder collapse model , the cosmic censorship conjectures , trapped surfaces and penrose s incompleteness theorems , and recent work of christodoulou on trapped surface formation in vacuum collapse , and we elaborate on these topics in sections  [ negmassec][vaccol ] .",
    "( the discussion in these three last sections was not included in the lectures , however , and is not necessary for understanding the rest of the notes . )",
    "the most basic self - gravitating objects are stars . in the most primitive stellar models , dating from the 19th century ,",
    "stars are modeled by a self - gravitating fluid surrounded by vacuum .",
    "moreover , to a first approximation , classically stars are _ spherically symmetric _ and _",
    "static_.    it should not be surprising then that early research on the einstein equations @xmath3 would address the question of the existence and structure of general relativistic stars in the new theory . in view of our above discussion",
    ", the most basic problem is to understand spherically symmetric , static metrics , represented in coordinates @xmath32 , such that the spacetime has two regions : in the region @xmath33the interior of the star ",
    "the metric should solve a suitable einstein - matter system @xmath3 with appropriate matter , and in the region @xmath34the exterior of the star ",
    "the spacetime should be vacuum , i.e.  the metric should solve @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath35    this is the problem first addressed by schwarzschild  @xcite , already in 1916 .",
    "schwarzschild considered the vacuum region first  @xcite and arrived .",
    "thus he had to use a rescaled @xmath36 as a coordinate .",
    "once this condition was removed from the theory , there is no reason not to take @xmath36 itself as the coordinate .",
    "it is in this sense that these coordinates can reasonably be called `` schwarzschild coordinates '' .",
    "] at the one - parameter family of solutions : @xmath37 every student of this subject should explicitly check that this solves @xmath22 ( * exercise * ) .    in  @xcite , schwarzschild found interior metrics for the darker shaded region @xmath33 above . in this region ,",
    "matter is described by a perfect fluid .",
    "we shall not write down explicitly such metrics here , as this would require a long digression into fluids , their equations of state , etc .",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "suffice it to say here that the existence of such solutions required that one take the constant @xmath26 positive , and the value @xmath38 marking the boundary of the star always satisfied @xmath39 .",
    "the constant @xmath26 could then be identified with the total mass of the star as measured by considering the orbits of far - away test particles .. ] in fact , for most reasonable matter models , static solutions of the type described above only exist under a stronger restriction on @xmath38 ( namely @xmath40 ) now known as the _ buchdahl inequality_. see  @xcite .",
    "the restriction on @xmath38 necessary for the existence of schwarzschild s stars appears quite fortuitous : it is manifest from the form @xmath27 that the components of @xmath10 are singular if the @xmath32 coordinate system for the vacuum region is extended to @xmath41 . but a natural ( if perhaps seemingly of only academic interest ) question arises , namely , what happens if one does away completely with the star and tries simply to consider the expression @xmath27 for all values of @xmath36 ?",
    "this at first glance would appear to be the problem of understanding the gravitational field of a `` point particle '' with the particle removed .    for much of the history of general relativity ,",
    "the degeneration of the metric functions at @xmath41 , when written in these coordinates , was understood as meaning that the gravitational field should be considered singular there .",
    "this was the famous schwarzschild `` singularity . ''",
    "since `` singularities '' were considered `` bad '' by most pioneers of the theory , various arguments were concocted to show that the behaviour of @xmath10 where @xmath41 is to be thought of as `` pathological '' , `` unstable '' , `` unphysical '' and thus , the solution should not be considered there .",
    "the constraint on @xmath38 related to the buchdahl inequality seemed to give support to this point of view .",
    "see also  @xcite .    with the benefit of hindsight , we now know that the interpretation of the previous paragraph is incorrect , on essentially every level : neither is @xmath41 a singularity , nor are singularities  which do in fact occur!necessarily to be discarded !",
    "nor is it true that non - existence of static stars renders the behaviour at @xmath41whatever it is``unstable '' or `` unphysical '' ; on the contrary , it was an early hint of gravitational collapse !",
    "let us put aside this hindsight for now and try to discover for ourselves the geometry and `` true '' singularities hidden in  @xmath27 , as well as the correct framework for identifying `` physical '' solutions . in so doing , we are retracing in part the steps of early pioneers who studied these issues without the benefit of the global geometric framework we now have at our disposal .",
    "all the notions referred to above will reveal themselves in the next subsections .",
    "the fact that the behaviour of the metric at @xmath41 is not singular , but simply akin to the well - known breakdown of the coordinates @xmath27 at @xmath42 ( this latter breakdown having never confused anyone  ) , is actually quite easy to see , and there is no better way to appreciate this than by doing the actual calculations .",
    "let us see how to proceed .",
    "first of all , before even attempting a change of coordinates , the following is already suggestive : consider say a future - directed .",
    "see appendix  [ lorge ] . ]",
    "ingoing radial null geodesic .",
    "the image of such a null ray is in fact depicted below : @xmath43 one can compute that this has finite affine length to the future , i.e.  these null geodesics are _ future - incomplete _ , while scalar curvature invariants remain bounded as @xmath44 .",
    "it is an amusing * exercise * to put oneself in this point of view and carry out the above computations in these coordinates .    of course",
    ", as such the above does nt show anything .",
    "but it turns out that indeed the metric can be extended to be defined on a `` bigger '' manifold .",
    "one defines a new coordinate @xmath45 this metric then takes the form @xmath46 on @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath48 , each interpreted in its respective coordinate system .",
    "but now @xmath49 can clearly be defined in the region @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and , by explicit computation or better , by analytic continuation , the metric @xmath49 must satisfy @xmath22 for all @xmath50 .",
    "transformations similar to the above were already known to eddington and lemaitre  @xcite in the early 1930 s .",
    "nonetheless , from the point of view of that time , it was difficult to interpret their significance .",
    "the formalisation of the manifold concept and associated language had not yet become common knowledge to physicists ( or most mathematicians for that matter ) , and in any case , there was no selection principle as to what should the underlying manifold @xmath13 be on which a solution @xmath10 to @xmath22 should live , or , to put it another way , the domain of @xmath10 in @xmath22 is not specified a priori by the theory .",
    "so , even if the solutions @xmath49 exist , how do we know that they are `` physical '' ?",
    "this problem can in fact only be clarifed in the context of the _ cauchy problem _ for @xmath3 coupled to appropriate matter .",
    "once the cauchy problem for @xmath22 is formulated correctly , then one can assign a _",
    "unique _ spacetime to an appropriate notion of _ initial data set_. this is the _",
    "maximal development _ of appendix  [ cauchyproblem ] .",
    "it is only the initial data set , and the matter model , which can be judged for `` physicality '' .",
    "one can not throw away the resulting maximal development just because one does not like its properties !    from this point of view , the question of whether the extension @xmath49 was `` physical '' was resolved in 1939 by oppenheimer and snyder  @xcite .",
    "specifically , they showed that the extension @xmath49 for @xmath52 arose as a subset of the solution to the einstein equations coupled to a reasonable ( to a first approximation at least ) matter model , evolving from physically plausible initial data .",
    "with hindsight , the notion of black hole was born in that paper .",
    "had history proceeded differently , we could base our futher discussion on  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the model  @xcite was ahead of its time . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the proper language to formulate the cauchy problem in general only came in 1969  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of explicit solutions remained the main route to understanding the theory .",
    "we will follow thus this route to the black hole concept  via the geometric study of so - called maximally extended schwarzschild  even though this spacetime is not to be regarded as `` physical '' .",
    "it was through the study of this spacetime that the relevant notions were first understood and the important penrose diagrammatic notation was developed .",
    "we shall return to  @xcite only in section  [ ossection ] .",
    "let us for now avoid the question of what the underlying manifold `` should '' be , a question whose answer requires physical input ( see paragraphs above ) , and simply ask the purely mathematical question of how big the underlying manifold `` can '' be .",
    "this leads to the notion of a `` maximally extended '' solution . in the case of schwarzschild",
    ", this will be a spacetime which , although not to be taken as a model for anything _ per se _ , can serve as a reference for the formulation of all important concepts in the subject .    to motivate this notion of",
    "`` maximally extended '' solution , let us examine our first extension a little more closely .",
    "the light cones can be drawn as follows : @xmath53    let us look say at null geodesics .",
    "one can see ( * exercise * ) that future directed null geodesics either approach @xmath54 or are future - complete . in the former case ,",
    "scalar invariants of the curvature blow up in the limit as the affine parameter approaches its supremum ( * exercise * ) .",
    "the spacetime is thus `` singular '' in this sense .",
    "it thus follows from the above properties that the above spacetime is _ future null geodesically incomplete _ , but also _ future null geodesically inextendible _ as a @xmath55 lorentzian metric , i.e.  there does not exist a larger @xmath5-dimensional lorentzian manifold with @xmath55 metric such that the spacetime above embeds isometrically into the larger one such that a future null geodesic passes into the extension .    on the other hand",
    ", one can see that past - directed null geodesics are not all complete , yet no curvature quantity blows up along them ( * exercise * ) . again , this suggests that something may still be missing !",
    "synge was the first to consider these issues systematically and construct `` maximal extensions '' of the original schwarzschild metric in a paper  @xcite of 1950 .",
    "a more concise approach to such a construction was given in a celebrated 1960 paper  @xcite of kruskal .",
    "indeed , let @xmath13 be the manifold with differentiable structure given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the open subset @xmath58 of the @xmath59-plane . consider the metric @xmath10 @xmath60 where @xmath36 is defined implicitly by @xmath61 the region @xmath57",
    "is depicted below : @xmath62 this is a spherically symmetric @xmath5-dimensional lorentzian manifold satisfying @xmath22 such that the original schwarzschild metric is isometric to the region @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 ) , and our previous partial extension is isometric to the region @xmath66 ( * exercise * ) .",
    "it can be shown now ( * exercise * ) that @xmath1 is _ inextendible as a @xmath55 ( in fact @xmath67 ) lorentzian manifold _ , that is to say , if @xmath68 is an isometric embedding , where @xmath69 is a @xmath55 ( in fact @xmath67 ) @xmath5-dimensional lorentzian manifold , then necessarily @xmath70 .",
    "the above property defines the sense in which our spacetime is `` maximally '' extended , and thus , @xmath1 is called sometimes _ maximally - extended schwarzschild_. in later sections , we will often just call it `` the schwarzschild solution '' .",
    "note that the form of the metric is such that the light cones are as depicted .",
    "thus , one can read off much of the causal structure by sight .",
    "it may come as a surprise that in maximally - extended schwarzschild , there are _ two _ regions which are isometric to the original @xmath47 schwarzschild region .",
    "alternatively , a cauchy surface . ] will have topology @xmath71 with _ two _ asymptotically flat ends .",
    "this suggests that this spacetime is not to be taken as a physical model .",
    "we will discuss this later on .",
    "for now , let us simply try to understand better the global geometry of the metric .",
    "there is an even more useful way to represent the above spacetime .",
    "first , let us define null coordinates @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "these coordinates have infinite range .",
    "we may rescale them by @xmath74 , @xmath75 to have finite range .",
    "( note the freedom in the choice of @xmath76 and @xmath77 ! )",
    "the domain of @xmath78 coordinates , when represented in the plane where the axes are at @xmath79 and @xmath80 degrees with the horizontal , is known as a _",
    "penrose diagram _ of schwarzschild .",
    "such a penrose diagram is depicted below be chosen so that the @xmath54 boundaries are horizontal lines ? ( * exercise * ) ] : @xmath81    in more geometric language , one says that a penrose diagram corresponds to the image of a bounded conformal map @xmath82 where one makes the identification @xmath83 , @xmath84 where @xmath85 are now the standard coordinates @xmath86 represented in the standard way on the plane .",
    "we further assume that the map preserves the time orientation , where minkowski space is oriented by @xmath87 .",
    "( in our application , this is a fancy way of saying that @xmath88 ) .",
    "it follows that the map preserves the causal structure of @xmath89 .",
    "in particular , we can `` read off '' the radial null geodesics of @xmath13 from the depiction .",
    "now we may turn to the boundary induced by the causal embedding .",
    "we define @xmath90 to be the boundary components as depicted .",
    "these are characterized geometrically as follows : @xmath91 are limit points of future - directed null rays in @xmath89 along which @xmath92 .",
    "similarly , @xmath93 are limit points of past - directed null rays for which @xmath94 .",
    "we call @xmath91 _ future null infinity _ and @xmath93 _ past null infinity_. the remaining boundary components @xmath95 and @xmath96 depicted are often given the names _ spacelike _ infinity and _ future ( past ) timelike _ infinity , respectively .    in the physical application",
    ", it is important to remember that asymptotically flat for a definition . ]",
    "spacetimes like our @xmath1 are not meant to represent the whole universe . ] , but rather , the gravitational field in the vicinity of an isolated self - gravitating system .",
    "@xmath91 is an idealization of far away observers who can receive radiation from the system . in this sense , `` we''as astrophysical observers of stellar collapse , say  are located at @xmath91 .",
    "the ambient causal structure of @xmath86 allows us to talk about @xmath97 for @xmath98 for @xmath99 . ] and this will lead us to the black hole concept . therein lies the use of the penrose diagram representation .    the systematic use of the conformal point of view to represent the global geometry of spacetimes is one of the many great contributions of penrose to general relativity .",
    "these representations can be traced back to the well - known `` spacetime diagrams '' of special relativity , promoted especially by synge  @xcite .",
    "the `` formal '' use of penrose diagrams in the sense above goes back to carter  @xcite , in whose hands these diagrams became a powerful tool for determining the global structure of all classical black hole spacetimes .",
    "it is hard to overemphasize how important it is for the student of this subject to become comfortable with these representations .      with penrose diagram notation",
    ", we may now explain the black hole concept .",
    "first an important remark : in schwarzschild , the boundary component @xmath91 enjoys a limiting affine completeness . more specifically , normalising a sequence of ingoing radial null vectors by parallel transport along an outgoing geodesic meeting @xmath91 , the affine length of the null geodesics generated by these vectors , parametrized by their parallel transport ( restricted to @xmath100 ) , tends to infinity : @xmath101 this has the interpretation that far - away observers in the radiation zone can observe for all time .",
    "( this is in some sense related to the presence of timelike geodesics near infinity of infinite length , but the completeness is best formulated with respect to @xmath91 . )",

    "there is a setting in which a quantitative version of @xmath601 has indeed been obtained : the results of  @xcite ( which apply to the nonlinear problem where the scalar field is coupled to the einstein equation , but which can be specialised to the decoupled case of the @xmath599 harmonic on schwarzschild ) prove in particular that latexmath:[\\[\\label{proved }    \\qquad    @xmath589 depends only on @xmath587 , and @xmath603 is a quantity depending only on the initial @xmath206 energy and a pointwise weighted @xmath528 norm . in view of the relation between @xmath557 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , @xmath604",

    "the statement  @xmath598 , one could then infer that for each @xmath47 , then @xmath607 , without however a rate ( * exercise * ) . ]",
    "it is well known , moreover , that to understand quantitative decay rates for general solutions , one must quantify trapping .",
    "this is not , however , captured by the heuristics leading to @xmath598 , essentially because for fixed @xmath608 , the effects of trapping concern an intermediate time interval not reflected in the tail .",
    "it should thus not be surprising that these heuristics do not address the fundamental problem at hand .",

    "the asymptotic distribution of the quasi - normal modes as @xmath611 can be thought to reflect trapping . on the other hand",

    "it is interesting to compare section 3 of  @xcite with what has now been proven : although the predictions of  @xcite do not quite match the situation in schwarzschild ( it is in particular incompatible with  @xmath598 ) , they apply well to the schwarzschild - de sitter case developed in section  [ cosmolosec ] .",
    "the upshot of the present discussion is the following : statements of the form  @xmath598 , while interesting , may have little to do with the problem of non - linear stability of black holes , and are perhaps more interesting for the lower bounds that they suggest .",
    "in fact , in view of their non - quantitative nature , these results are less relevant for the stability problem than the quantitative boundedness theorem of kay and wald .",
    "even the statement of section  [ eazy ] can not be derived as a corollary of the statement  @xmath598 , nor would knowing  @xmath598 simplify in any way the proof of section  [ eazy ] .",
    "we now turn to the problem of perturbing the schwarzschild metric and proving boundedness and decay for the wave equation on the backgrounds of such perturbed metrics .",
    "let us recall our dilemma : the boundedness argument of section  [ s1 ] required that @xmath203 remains causal everwhere in the exterior . in view of the comments of section  [ pertsec0 ] , this is clearly unstable . on the other hand ,",

    "the _ kerr metric _ is a @xmath12-parameter family of metrics first discovered  @xcite in 1963 .",

    "the above coordinate system is defined in a domain of outer communications , and the horizon will correspond to the limit @xmath619 , where @xmath620 is the larger positive root of @xmath621 , i.e. @xmath622    since the motivation of our study is the cauchy problem for the einstein equations , it is more natural to consider not maximal extensions , but maximal developments of complete initial data .",
    "( see appendix  [ cauchyproblem ] . ) in the schwarzschild case , the maximal development of initial data on a cauchy surface @xmath128 as described previously coincides with maximally - extended schwarzschild . in kerr ,",
    "if we are to take an asymptotically flat ( with two ends ) hypersurface in a maximally extended kerr for parameter range @xmath623 , then its maximal development will have a smooth boundary in maximally - extended kerr .",
    "this boundary is what is known as a _",

    "this is of no concern to us here , however . by definition , for us the term `` kerr metric @xmath624 '' will always denote the maximal development of a complete asymptotically flat hypersurface @xmath128 , as above , with two ends .",
    "one can depict the penrose - diagramatic representation of a suitable two - dimensional timelike slice of this solution as below : @xmath625 this depiction coincides with the standard penrose diagram of the spherically symmetric reissner - nordstrm metric  @xcite .    with this convention in mind , we note that the dependence of @xmath626 on @xmath612 is smooth in the range @xmath627 . in particular",

    "moreover , in contrast to the schwarzschild case , there is no `` easy result '' that one can obtain away from the horizon analogous to section  [ eazy ] .",
    "in fact , the problem of proving any sort of boundedness statement for general solutions to @xmath239 on kerr had been open until very recently .",
    "we will describe in the next section our recent resolution  @xcite of this problem .",
    "we will derive a rather general boundedness theorem for a class of axisymmetric stationary black hole exteriors near schwarzschild .",
    "the result ( theorem  [ kerbnd ] ) will include slowly rotating kerr solutions with parameters @xmath29 .",
    "we have already explained in what sense the kerr metric is `` close '' to schwarzschild in the region @xmath291 .",
    "let us note that with respect to the coordinates @xmath636 , @xmath113 , @xmath637 , @xmath644 in @xmath291 , then @xmath645 and @xmath646 are killing for both the schwarzschild and the kerr metric .",

    "there is however an additional geometric assumption we shall need , and this is motivated by a geometric property of the kerr spacetime , to be described in the section that follows immediately .",
    "let us here remark a geometric property of the kerr spacetime itself which turns out to be of utmost importance in what follows : let @xmath153 denote a null generator of @xmath104 .",
    "then @xmath647 there is a deep reason why this is true . for stationary black holes with non - degenerate horizons ,",
    "a celebrated argument of hawking retrieves a second killing field in the direction of the null generator @xmath153 .",
    "thus , if @xmath645 and @xmath646 span the complete set of killing fields , then @xmath153 must evidently be in their span .",
    "in fact , choosing @xmath153 accordingly we have @xmath648    ( for the kerr solution , we have that there exists a timelike direction in the span of @xmath645 and @xmath646 for all points outside the horizon",

    "in particular , if one could localise the integrated version of @xmath658 to arbitrary sufficiently large subsegments @xmath669 , one could obtain @xmath670    this would leave @xmath671 . since this frequency range does not suggest a direct boundedness argument , it is natural to revisit the decay mechanism of schwarzschild .",
    "we have already discussed ( see section  [ pertsec01 ] ) the instability of the decay argument ; this instability arose from the structure of the set of trapped null geodesics . at the heuristic level , however , it is easy to see that , if one can take @xmath672 sufficiently small , then solutions supported in @xmath668 can not be trapped . in particular , for @xmath29 , * superradiant frequencies for @xmath239 on kerr are not trapped*. this will be the fundamental observation allowing for the boundedness theorem .",

    "the einstein equations are coupled with matter , or the bianchi - triaxial ix vacuum problem discussed in section  [ higherhigherdim ] , the completeness of null infinity can be inferred easily without detailed understanding of the geometry  @xcite .",

    "<S> interest in this problem stems from its relationship to the non - linear stability of the black hole spacetimes themselves as solutions to the einstein equations , one of the central open problems of general relativity . after an introductory discussion of the schwarzschild geometry and the black hole concept , the classical theorem of kay and wald on the boundedness of scalar waves on the exterior region of schwarzschild is reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> the original proof is presented , followed by a new more robust proof of a stronger boundedness statement . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of decay of scalar waves on schwarzschild is then addressed , and a theorem proving quantitative decay is stated and its proof sketched . this decay statement is carefully contrasted with the type of statements derived heuristically in the physics literature for the asymptotic tails of individual spherical harmonics . following this , </S>",
    "<S> our recent proof of the boundedness of solutions to the wave equation on axisymmetric stationary backgrounds ( including slowly - rotating kerr and kerr - newman ) is reviewed and a new decay result for slowly - rotating kerr spacetimes is stated and proved . </S>",
    "<S> this last result was announced at the summer school and appears in print here for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> a discussion of the analogue of these problems for spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 follows . </S>",
    "<S> finally , a general framework is given for capturing the red - shift effect for non - extremal black holes . </S>",
    "<S> this unifies and extends some of the analysis of the previous sections . </S>",
    "<S> the notes end with a collection of open problems . </S>"
