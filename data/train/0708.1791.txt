    "to probe the effect of changes in the object diffusion coefficient alone while avoiding the above complications , we monitored the motion of actin - propelled beads near glass surfaces .",

    "is shown in fig .  1",
    ". we performed experiments in thin , @xmath3 @xmath4 m thick chambers using spacer beads to separate a glass coverslip and slide ( errors are listed as standard deviation unless otherwise stated ) .",
    "the effective solution viscosity close to a flat wall is increased by proximity to the solid  liquid boundary .",
    "the magnitude of this increase depends on the ratio of the object radius to the object  glass separation .",
    "a one - micron diameter sphere located one micron from a flat surface experiences a 39% increase in apparent viscosity , whereas a 5nm sized protein at the same position feels only a 0.3% increase .",
    "this hydrodynamic effect is enhanced in our chambers by the presence of two close  by interfaces , and the viscosity is given by@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the viscosity for a separation @xmath7 between the center of the bead and the closest glass surface , @xmath8 is the viscosity in an unbounded fluid , @xmath9 is the sphere radius ( @xmath10  nm in our case ) , and @xmath11 is the separation of the two walls .",
    "we recorded the motion of 13 actin - propelled beads for 30 minutes each or until the feedback tracking lost the bead , yielding run lengths from 8 to 173  @xmath4 m .",
    "bead velocities in these chambers averaged 58  @xmath12  38 nm / s .",
    "we measured the viscosity of our extract solutions using both a 1  mm diameter falling ball viscometer and by tracking the thermal motion of optically trapped beads .",
    "the average value of @xmath13  pa@xmath14s is approximately three times that of water , similar to previously reported measurements@xcite .",
    "we calculated the velocity as a function of the distance to the nearest glass surface and found that a viscous interaction with the chamber surfaces reduced the velocity of moving beads ( fig .",
    "2a ) . because of the wide variance in velocities from bead to bead , we normalized the velocities by the average velocity for each run .",
    "these data show that velocity falls off to about 60% of its peak value , which occurs at the middle of the chamber , as the bead moves close to the glass surface where the apparent viscosity experienced by the bead is highest . to ensure that this effect was not due to a steric interaction with the wall , we separately measured the velocity dependence on height when the bead was moving towards the nearest surface or away from it and found identical results .",
    "the simplest br models predict that the velocity varies inversely with viscosity .",
    "the best fit of this model to the data of fig .",
    "2a , using eq .",
    "[ visceq ] for the dependence of viscosity on bead height , yields a radius of @xmath15  nm , consistent with the size of the bead or , potentially , the actin network itself and not the actin monomers or filaments within the network , which are considerably smaller@xcite . if wall effects slow bead motion by limiting the fluctuation of individual actin filaments we would have expected to recover a much lower radius . using eq .",
    "[ visceq ] and our experimentally measured values for @xmath11 and @xmath8 , we calculated the velocity as a function of viscosity ( fig .",
    "the small separation between surfaces in these experiments relative to the size of the moving beads reduces the velocity at all positions in the chamber .",
    "thus the average velocity computed from these experiments is predicted to be lower than if the bead were moving in free solution by a factor of 1.6 , corresponding to a predicted unbounded velocity of @xmath16  nm / s . to test this prediction we measured bead motility in 80  @xmath4m",
    " thick chambers formed by separating a coverslip from a glass slide using double - stick tape , in which wall effects are estimated to be less than 2% on average . in these chambers , beads moved with an average velocity of @xmath17  nm / s ( @xmath18 ) , faster than in the thinner chambers .",
    "an increase in the viscous forces acting on moving beads is too small to explain the changes in velocity with height .",
    "the total force needed to overcome drag at the measured viscosities and velocities in our experiments is on the order of 20  fn .",
    "recent work has shown that such small forces have little effect on the velocity of actin  propelled beads , and we expect that viscous forces around 20  fn would only slow the beads by at most 0.01%@xcite , much less than the observed 36% decrease in velocity near the walls . instead , we propose that an increase in viscosity alters the amplitude of bead position fluctuations which impedes the growth of filaments .",
    "fluctuating br models predict that bead velocity should scale with fluctuation amplitude .",
    "we calculated the average power spectra for bead position tracks at different distances to the surface after first removing the linear trends from the data ( fig .",
    "the amplitude of brownian fluctuations scaled monotonically with distance to the surface over a large range of frequencies , with beads exhibiting a reduced fluctuation amplitude when closer to the surface . as expected for a br mechanism where object fluctuations allow the intercalation of actin monomers at the tips of filaments , bead velocity increased with increasing noise amplitude ( fig .",
    "3b ) . while our detrending algorithm removes much of the velocity content of the power spectra , residual variation due to the time  varying velocity limits further model  independent quantitative analysis of the power spectra ( _ see methods _ ) .",
    "specifically , because the time scales for the thermal position fluctuations and the velocity fluctuations caused by a changing number of filaments and elastic attachments overlap , it is impossible to isolate them from one another .",
    "the nanoscale features of bead motion observed in our experiments also shed light on the role of adhesion between the growing network and bead .",
    "all br mechanisms inherently lead to saltatory motion because of the stochastic timing of monomer addition kinetics . however , adhesion  based models , in which elastic linkages between the object and growing network attach and detach , predict an additional step  like component because the number of network linkages under stress fluctuates over time .",
    "this leads to a relaxation of the object position whenever the number of load  bearing elements changes .",
    "both theoretical and computational adhesion  based models predict a broad distribution of nanometer ",
    "sized steps using physiologically relevant parameters@xcite .",
    "computer simulations by alberts and odell show that pauses start when a number of linkages form simultaneously , and end when those linkages break together@xcite .",
    "alternatively , a uniform 5.4  nm step size is predicted by models involving end - tracking motors@xcite and was observed in two studies of moving _ listeria _ cells@xcite .    to measure the distribution of steps in our records of bead motion , we ran a pause  finding algorithm that locates positions where the magnitude of the velocity falls below a user  defined threshold value@xcite on the tracking data from both the 2@xmath4 m and 80@xmath4 m thick chambers ( fig .",
    "histograms of the step sizes , the distance between adjacent pauses in position , and pause times , the amount of time between adjacent pauses are shown in fig .",

    "the step size distribution was broad with smaller steps more probable than larger ones , in agreement with predictions from the adhesion ",
    "based models@xcite and not end  tracking models or the data from _ listeria _ cells .",
    "adhesion  based br models also predict a correlation of the step sizes in time because pauses are induced by the rupture of a relatively small number of linkages , such that the total number does not change significantly with each step@xcite .",
    "because the step size is largely related to the ratio of the number of breaking linkages to the total link number , many steps are thus required to significantly alter the step size . in the model of alberts and odell ,",
    "the formation of @xmath19 links was able to induce a pause while the total link number was approximately 100 .",
    "on the other hand , if adhesion is not important , general br models do not predict any correlation . to distinguish between these two possibilities",
    ", we performed an autocorrelation analysis on the measured step sizes ( fig .",
    "we find that the magnitude of the step sizes changes slowly with time such that the autocorrelation falls off according to a double exponential with decay constants of 17  @xmath12  1 and 383  @xmath12  7 steps , corresponding to approximately 80 and 1,800  nm of motion , respectively .",
    "this represents the distance , on average , a bead must move before the topology of the load  bearing elements in the network changes significantly .",
    "monomer addition kinetics have been measured to be @xmath20 , considerably slower than the characteristic frequency of monomer ",
    "sized oscillations for a freely diffusing bead @xcite . at face value",
    "these two facts seem to indicate that object fluctuations should have little effect on the overall polymerization rate .",
    "however , several factors complicate this basic picture .",
    "first , the addition of elastic connections between the object and network drastically changes the frequency distribution of any thermal motions , and therefore prediction of the timescales of bead or network fluctuations is impossible without a direct measurement of these elastic linkages .",
    "second , thermal fluctuations also affect the rates at which the elastic connections attach and detach , and therefore may affect network growth .",
    "current experimental data is insufficient to predict , _ a priori _ , the effect of object fluctuations on network growth .",
    "we therefore sought to use a computational model , similar to those used by previous groups@xcite , to investigate the influence of object fluctuations in the presence of dynamic elastic connections .",
    "we found that a minimal model , in which a fluctuating object is elastically coupled to a group of polymerizing filaments , is sufficient to predict the observed dependence of velocity on viscosity . in designing the computational model , we chose to incorporate only those features that our experiments indicated were necessary and sufficient to explain the observed phenomena , and we did not attempt to build a complete model of actin network growth .",
    "our monte carlo simulations consisted of actin filaments which can grow in one dimension if sufficient space exists between the moving object and the filament end . elastic links attach and detach to the filaments with force - dependent kinetics ( additional details of modeling and simulations can be found in the supplemental information and supplementary fig .",
    "the result of 50 ten - second simulations over a range of viscosities like those experienced by our beads correctly predicts an increase in velocity of similar magnitude to our experimental observations ( fig .",
    "thus , even when we choose realistic polymerization kinetics and bead diffusion constants , we find a dramatic effect of the amplitude of thermal motions on the overall bead velocity .",
    "interestingly , our simulations underestimate the velocity for very high viscosities , where bead fluctuations are highly damped .",
    "it is possible that for these situations , filament fluctuations become more important than bead oscillations and are able to drive motility .",
    "while our data indicate that bead fluctuations influence motility , several additional factors may be present as well .",
    "first , the change in velocity with height we observe yields a size  scale of approximately 400  nm for the fluctuating element , leaving open the possibility that either the bead or the actin network is the source of the relevant fluctuations .",
    "thermal energy must be disappated by fluctuation of the filaments and crosslinks within the network , and this breathing could have significant amplitude at length scales approaching the bead radius .",
    "we expect that future work on the rheological properties of actin networks will give insight into the amplitude of these thermal modes .",
    "second , our data do not exclude a role for filament fluctuations in propulsion , only that under our experimental conditions they do not appear to dominate .",
    "therefore , our data are not inconsistent with reports of immobilized beads which grow networks at the same rates as free beads@xcite . in this situations",
    ", we expect that network or filament fluctuations must contribute to motion production .",
    "taken together , these data and simulations demonstrate that actin polymerization produces mechanical work via an object  fluctuating br mechanism , with adhesion dynamics playing a critical role in movement .",
    "thermal fluctuations of the moving object , and not of the actin filaments , govern the velocity of actin - propelled beads , a common mimic for intracellular bacterial pathogens such as _ rickettsia rickettsii _ , _ listeria monocytogenes _ and _ shigella flexneri_. along these lines , if membrane fluctuations are found to influence motion in the case of lamellipodial and filopodial protrusions , cells could dynamically modify the tension or composition of their membranes in order to modulate the speed of protrusions and finely control actin network organization . future research into the role of membrane tension on actin network growth will shed light on the control mechanisms used during actin  based motility .",
    "carboxylated polystyrene beads 792  @xmath12  23 nm in diameter ( polysciences ) were coated uniformly with the nucleation - promotion factor ricka purified from _ rickettsia rickettsii _ ( a gift of matthew welch , university of california , berkeley ) .",

    "for the 80  @xmath4 m thick chambers , a flow chamber was made by separating a microscope slide and coverslip with two pieces of double - sided tape .",
    "approximately 20  @xmath4l of the assay mixture was flowed through the chamber , which was then sealed .",
    "our instrument is similar to one described previously@xcite , and it uses a single 809nm wavelength diode laser ( blue sky research ) to measure microsphere position using a position - sensitive detector ( pacific silicon sensors ) that monitors scattered light in the back focal plane .",

    "in addition , a low - light camera ( qimaging ) is used to take fluorescence images concurrent with optical trapping .",
    "chamber thicknesses were measured by moving a trapped bead along the microscope axis to find the contact position for both surfaces in an operation similar to the surface  finding protocol described in lang _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite    we used a software - based feedback procedure ( labview ) implemented to track actin propelled beads over very long distances . in our experiments , 3d photodiode voltage signals @xcite are sampled at 2  khz , anti - alias filtered at 1  khz and converted into 3d position in realtime using a similar algorithm to lang et al . , but with a 5th order 3d polynomial@xcite .",
    "3d calibration parameters were measured before each experiment using a bead stuck to the coverglass surface .",

    ", we used a very low laser power to ensure that the optical force experienced by the bead was extremely small , typically less than 0.01  fn .      to compute the velocity of each run we first calculated the time derivatives of the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 position versus time records by performing a 4th order savitsky - golay filter with a time constant of five seconds and extracting the first derivative@xcite .",
    "the total velocity as a function of time was then computed by adding the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 velocities in quadrature .",
    "the position of a bead along its 3d pathlength , @xmath24 , can be found by integrating the magnitude of the velocity vector over the integral @xmath25 $ ] @xcite . in practice , the velocity data is significantly noisy so that it must be calculated with a reduced bandwidth .",
    "we found that 0.2  hz was sufficient to preserve the long timescale shape of the motility paths while smoothing out the faster timescale fluctuations .",
    "therefore , @xmath24 , as defined above , only contains information on a timescale slower than five seconds . in order to recover the pathlength at the full 2  khz bandwidth",

    "this integral effectively sums only the component of the high frequency motion that lies along the average path direction .",
    "power spectra of bead position fluctuations were calculated using a four second analysis window .",
    "the spectra from moving beads are heavily dominated by the linear velocity component of the motion , which adds a @xmath30 component at all frequencies . to examine the position fluctuations apart from this velocity contribution ,",
    "we first detrended the data by subtracting the results of a linear fit from each window before performing the power spectral analysis . because bead motion is nonuniform and the velocity changes over time ,",
    "the detrending is not perfect , and the resulting power spectra decay slower than @xmath30 in the high  frequency regime for both the experimental data and the simulations .",
