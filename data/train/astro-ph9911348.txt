    "the moa project * m*icrolensing * o*bservations in * a*strophysics is a collaboration of about 30 astronomers / physicists in new zealand and japan working in about 10 different institutions ( headquarters nagoya and auckland universities ) .",
    "the project was established in 1995 .",
    "the moa project goals are ( a ) the search for dark matter by microlensing in the galactic halo , ( b ) the search for planets by microlensing , in halo and galactic bulge , ( c ) the study of variable stars in the magellanic clouds and bulge and ( d ) the optical identification of @xmath9-ray bursters ( grbs )    the observational program is undertaken on the 61-cm boller & chivens telescope at the university of canterbury s mt john university observatory in the centre of the south island of new zealand . here",
    "there is a dark sky background and typically 13 arcsec seeing ; between a third and a half of the weather is suitable for ccd photometry . at the latitude of @xmath0 s , the magellanic clouds are circumpolar and",
    "can be observed all year .",
    "the telescope is a ritchey - chrtien cassegrain instrument modified to accommodate wide - field f/6.25 optics and a modern computer control system .",
    "three series of moa observations have been undertaken as follows    1 .",

    "aug 1998  present f/6.25 cass .",
    "@xmath12 , moacamii    in all cases , very broad - band @xmath13 and @xmath14 filters have been used , covering respectively about 395620 nm ( @xmath15 nm ) and 6201050 nm ( @xmath16 nm ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . series 1 used the f/13.5 optics and encompassed @xmath17 stars in three lmc fields .",
    "series 2 covered three fields ( nlmc1,2,3 ) in the lmc bar ( @xmath18 stars ) plus two smc fields ( smc1,2 ) ( @xmath19 stars ) .    for series 3 , which is currently in progress , the new moacamii is used to observe 16 lmc fields ( all year ) ( @xmath20 stars ) plus 8 smc fields ( all year ) ( @xmath21 stars ) plus 16 galactic bulge fields ( winter only)(@xmath22 stars ) .",
    "each of the moacamii fields covers about 1.25 square degrees .",
    "exposure times are 5 min .  in @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the clouds , 3 minutes in the galactic bulge .",
    "the ccd camera moacami comprises a mosaic of nine ti tc215 @xmath23 pixel ccds whose pixel size is 12 @xmath24 m ( @xmath25 at f/13.5 , @xmath26 at f/6.25 ) .",
    "the chips are not butted , so four consecutive interleaved exposures are required to cover a @xmath11 field .",
    "the recently acquired moacamii has now replaced the first camera .",
    "it consists of three butted site @xmath27-pixel thinned , back - illuminated ccds with 15-@xmath24 m pixels ( @xmath28 at f/6.25 ) .",
    "the peak qe is 85% .",
    "the area of the ccd surface is @xmath29 cm , and there are 24 mpixels . both cameras operated at a temperature of @xmath30 c with liquid n@xmath31 .",
    "generally we expose each magellanic cloud field once or sometimes twice per night in both @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and each galactic bulge field about four times per night in @xmath14 and once in @xmath13 , unless a known high magnification microlensing event is in progress , in which case frequent successive exposures are made .",
    "moa observations of ccd images are recorded to 8-mm exabyte tape for sending to japan , while an archival copy on dlt tape is retained at mt john . for series 1 and 2 observations , all the reductions",
    "have been completed using the dophot software package .",
    "one of us ( i.b . ) completed an archived database of all series 1 and 2 frames giving magnitudes in @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the case of series 2 images ,",
    "there are some 200 data points in each colour and about @xmath32 stars .",
    "series 3 images using moacamii have hitherto not been reduced .",
    "i.  bond is currently perfecting implementation of the alard & lupton ( 1997 ) difference imaging technique , which already has shown that a substantial improvement in photometric precision is possible for crowded fields in only moderate seeing .",
    "it is hoped to reduce series 3 images early in 2000 and then to be able to reduce all images on site at the observatory in nearly real time .",
    "a sun enterprise 450 computer with 90 gbyte hard disk drive is used for on - site data analysis at mt john .",
    "mt john @xmath33 moa photometry gives colours which transform linearly to johnson colours , as calibrated by reid , dodd & sullivan ( 1997 ) , as follows : @xmath34 @xmath35 the calibration of moa magnitudes gives the following transformation from the moa instrumental system to that of the hst guide star catalogue .",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37    the typical precision of the series 2 moa magnitudes is @xmath38 mag . at @xmath13 or @xmath39 ; @xmath40 mag .  at @xmath13 or @xmath41  15 .",
    "three surveys on variable stars in the moa database have been undertaken or are in progress .",
    "one of these has been by s.  noda ( nagoya univ . ,",
    "msc ) and m.  takeuti ( tohoku univ . ,",
    "sendai ) , and is a study of variables in series 2 observations .",
    "the stars are selected by several criteria ( see noda et al . in these proceedings ) .",
    "periods have been obtained by the phase dispersion method ( pdm ) .",
    "important aspects of this study include :    * study of red variables  mainly sr ; 188 variables in the lmc , 35 in the smc * study of eclipsing binaries ; 69 eb in the lmc , 136 in the smc * study of cepheids ; 78 in the lmc , 38 in the smc * study of blue variables ( many detected ) ; may be be stars , at least one is a so - called bumper , resembling a microlensing light curve    by using another selection , 282 agb variables were found in the lmc and 69 in the smc ( see takeuti et al . in these proceedings ) .",
    "the periods and the @xmath42-band magnitudes of most of these stars are comparable with those in the literaure .",
    "the relation between the period and the mean colour for the agb variables is reported .",
    "another study has been by n.  rattenbury ( auckland univ .",
    ", msc ) , using selected moa fields for series 1 and 2 data .",
    "variable stars were detected by deriving the welch - stetson variability index ( stetson , 1996 ; welch & stetson , 1993 ) . only about 2% of the stars with greatest variability",
    "were selected for further study in this preliminary survey .",
    "typically these stars have a range in the @xmath14 magnitude exceeding @xmath43 .",
    "periods were analysed in several ways , the most successful algorithm being the date compensated discrete fourier transform ( dcdft ) algorithm of ferraz - mello ( 1981 ) .",
    "the following summarizes the preliminary results .",
    "* study of cepheids ( periods 110 d ) : 70 were identified in the lmc and 420 in the smc * study of cepheids or semi - regular variables ( @xmath44 1050 d ) : 433 in the lmc , several more in the smc * eclipsing binaries and rr lyrae stars ( @xmath44 120 h ) : 7 in lmc , 71 in smc * blue variables ( @xmath45 ) : 37 were identified in the smc including 7 of long or irregular period , 2 possible `` bumpers '' , and at least 3 eclipsing binaries . * red variables with @xmath46 and @xmath47 d ( lpv , sr ) :",
    "89 were found in the smc and 5 in the lmc    fig .",
    "2 shows @xmath13 and @xmath14 phased light curves for four of the cepheids in the field smc2 ( series 2 ) .",
    "3 shows unphased quasi - periodic light curves for four long period variables from field nlmc2 ( series 2 ) .",
    "finally g.  bayne , w.  tobin and j.  pritchard ( univ .",
    "canterbury , n.z . ) are searching the moa database for eclipsing binaries and analysing the light curves ( series 1 , 2 ) .",
    "this work is still in progress , using the period - searching algorithm of grison ( 1994 ) ."
