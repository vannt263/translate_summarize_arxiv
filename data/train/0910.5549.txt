    "a recent remarkable trend in the physics community is its engagement in interdisciplinary fields using physics - inspired techniques .",
    "econophysics is one such area in which financial markets are simulated by agent - based models in much the same way as other many - body systems in statistical physics . the minority game ( mg )",
    "@xcite is an agent - based model based on the insight that agents making minority decisions in markets can take advantage of other agents . due to its success in capturing the profit - seeking behavior of agents",
    ", it became the progenitor of a family of agent - based models @xcite , which study various aspects of market behavior , such as volatility @xcite , noise @xcite , market - clearing mechanisms @xcite , and anticipative strategies @xcite .",
    "the market behavior depends on the way the agents evaluate their strategies when they make choices among them to take actions . in early versions of the minority games ,",
    "agents evaluate their strategies using various _ virtual points _ or _ scores_. typical virtual point updating rules , such as those in the original mg @xcite , evaluate the buying and selling decisions at a time step , regardless of the need to update the historical effects of the previous decisions .",
    "in other models , one - step expectations of the agents are considered , leading to the $ -game @xcite .",
    "there are also market models with a mixture of trend - following and fundamentalist agents @xcite or markets with crossover regimes dominated by trend - following and fundamentalist strategies @xcite .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , these models do not reflect the history - dependent considerations of real market agents .",
    "improved versions of the minority games considered agents using _ virtual wealth _ to evaluate their strategies @xcite .",
    "the wealth game ( wg ) @xcite was introduced to overcome this deficiency .",
    "agents in wg evaluate their strategies by calculating their virtual wealth , that is , the wealth ( including cash and stocks ) that the strategies would bring were their recommendations completely adopted in history .",
    "the most significant advantage of this evaluation method can be seen when agents are allowed to make _ holding _ decisions ( that is , decisions to take no buying or selling actions ) . in wg ,",
    "the virtual wealth due to holding long ( short ) positions increases when stock prices are rising ( dropping ) . on the other hand ,",
    "virtual point updates in the original mg are neutral to holding positions .",
    "tests with real market and artificial data confirm the versatility of wealth - based strategies @xcite .",
    "a consequence of using wealth - based strategies in wg is the emergence of price cycles through the self - organization of the different types of agents .",
    "this is both an important and interesting issue , since it sheds light on the formation and disappearance of bubbles and crashes in real financial markets .",
    "giardina and bouchaud considered a model with bubbles and crashes in the price trend of the market @xcite .",
    "the behavior was explained in terms of the interplay between the trend - following and fundamentalist behaviors of the agents , but the mechanism of the disappearance of this periodic phase remains an open issue . in wg ,",
    "the roles of the trendsetters and fickle agents in sustaining the price cycles were explained , and the disappearance of the periodic phase was attributed to the failure of the trendsetters to gain wealth from the fickle agents .",
    "( the trendsetters are synonymous to the trend - followers in the literature , but are renamed trendsetters to emphasize their role in initiating the bubbles and crashes . )",
    "however , this picture assumes the presence of market makers , who manage to fulfill buy and sell orders irrespective of the order imbalance .",
    "this is not applicable to the stock market , since in the absence of market makers , the market clearing mechanism requires an exact matching of buy and sell orders .",
    "consequently , not all agents can have their buying or selling orders fulfilled .",
    "thus , the unfulfilled buyers ( sellers ) would repeat their bids ( asks ) step after step .",
    "this creates a much stronger tendency for the price to go monotonically upwards ( downwards ) .",
    "the appearance of the periodic phase becomes questionable and , if it exists , its mechanism of formation and disappearance may not necessarily be the same .    in this paper",
    ", we study a simplified model of wg in the absence of market makers , focusing on the mechanism creating and destroying the cycles of bubbles and crashes .",
    "we will adopt a minimalist approach , and consider the simple but essential elements that contribute to the studied mechanism .",
    "it turns out that with trend - followers and fundamentalists of memory size 2 being the two main groups of investors , the price dynamics already exhibits many interesting features .",
    "( the fundamentalists are further divided into optimistic and pessimistic subgroups . ) on one hand , these groups are inclusive enough to represent the attitudes of most investors , and on the other hand , simple enough to enable convenient analyses . despite the simplification",
    ", we will see that many important features and phase transitions in the original wg with market makers are preserved .",
    "rich econophysical implications are revealed regardless of the simplifications .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows . after introducing the model in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , we describe different attractor behaviors in the space of price sensitivity and market impact in sec . [",
    "sec : phase - diagram ] .",
    "analytical studies about the phase transitions , including the cause of the transition and the precise location of the phase boundary , are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : the - transient - period ] to [ sec : the - phase - boundary ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : f - dependence ] , we study the dependence of the attractor behavior on the fraction of trend - followers , accompanied by a concise analytical study about the corresponding phase transition .",
    "finally , the conclusion is drawn in sec .",
    "[ cha : conclusion ] .",
    "the wealth game @xcite consists of @xmath0 agents playing in a single - commodity market . for convenience",
    ", we will use the language of stock markets in the following discussions . at each time step , the agents make decisions to buy , sell , or hold ( no action ) stocks , based on the predictions of their best strategies .",
    "the decision of agent @xmath1 at time @xmath2 is denoted as @xmath3 , which corresponds to buy , sell or hold respectively .",
    "a strategy takes the the signs of previous @xmath4 historical price changes ( represented by a string of @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) as the input signal , and the output signal is the advice on the trading action of the present step .",
    "table [ tab : typical strategy ] shows the possible content of a strategy for @xmath7 .",
    "we require each usable strategy to have at least one buying and one selling prediction , or else it is too dull to be used . with this restriction ,",
    "@xmath8 strategies are randomly drawn to each agent .       besides the single event described in table [ tab : type iii cash redistribution ] , there are also initial conditions which result in tt and tb holding slightly different amount of cash before significant cash redistribution occurs .",
    "this gives rise to the occurrence of two events , but the final cash distribution remains the same ."
