    "let @xmath1 be a hypersurface of @xmath2 defined by a bihomogeneous polynomial .",
    "if the dimension of @xmath1 is at least three , the lefschetz theorem says that the inclusion induces an isomorphism of picard groups @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask how the various cones of divisors of @xmath1 are related to those of the ambient space @xmath2 . in general",
    "this relation is not obvious , as examples of hassett  lin  wang @xcite and szendri @xcite show that the nef cone of @xmath1 can be strictly greater than that of the ambient variety .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a complete picture describing the birational structure of such hypersurfaces .",
    "in particular , we compute the cones of effective , movable or nef divisors on @xmath1 and determine its birational models . in the last section we also consider hypersurfaces in products of more than two projective spaces .",
    "recall that a normal @xmath4-factorial projective variety @xmath1 is a _ mori dream space _",
    "if the following three conditions are fulfilled : ( i ) @xmath5 is finitely generated ; ( ii ) the nef cone @xmath6 is generated by the classes of finitely many semiample divisors ; and ( iii ) there is a finite collection of small @xmath4-factorial modifications @xmath7 such that each @xmath8 satisfies ( ii ) and the movable cone of @xmath1 decomposes as @xmath9 .",
    "mori dream spaces were introduced by hu and keel in @xcite as a class of varieties with good birational geometry properties .",
    "for example , the condition of being a mori dream space is equivalent to having a finitely generated cox ring ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) ( see section [ notations ] ) .",
    "moreover , choosing a presentation for the cox ring gives an embedding of @xmath1 into a simplicial toric variety @xmath10 such that each of the modifications @xmath11 above is induced from a modification of the ambient toric variety @xmath10 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.11 ) ) . from this one shows that the minimal model program can be carried out for any divisor and has a combinatorial structure as in the case of toric varieties .",
    "being a mori dream space is a relatively strong condition and there are classical examples of varieties that are not .",
    "perhaps the most famous of these is nagata s counterexample to hilbert s 14th problem , in which he proves that the blow - up of @xmath12 along the base - locus of a general cubic pencil has infinitely many @xmath13-curves @xcite .",
    "this blow - up is clearly not a mori dream space since each of the @xmath13-curves would require a generator of the cox ring .",
    "the same phenomenon happens for a k3 surface with large picard number , where one typically expects infinitely many @xmath14-curves .",
    "there are also other obstructions to being a mori dream space than the non - polyhedrality of the effective / nef cones .",
    "indeed , there might be integral classes in the boundary of the nef cone which are not semiample . in this paper",
    "we will construct concrete examples of this phenomenon even for picard number 2 ; in fact ` most ' hypersurfaces in @xmath15 have an extremal divisor of the nef cone which does not even have an effective multiple , so they are not mori dream spaces .",
    "thus these hypersurfaces provide simple counterparts to nagata s examples above .",
    "the following theorem summarizes the geometry of such hypersurfaces :    [ decones ] let @xmath1 be a @xmath4-factorial , normal hypersurface of bidegree @xmath16 in @xmath2 of dimension at least three and let @xmath17 . if @xmath18 , @xmath1 is a mori dream space and the cox ring is isomorphic to @xmath19/(f)$ ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath20    when @xmath1 is a general hypersurface in @xmath15 , we have the following :    a.   if @xmath21 , the second projection realizes @xmath1 as the blow - up of @xmath22 along @xmath23 , and the exceptional divisor is linearly equivalent to @xmath24 , and @xmath25 b.   @xmath26 .",
    "there is a variety @xmath27 and a small birational modification @xmath28 , which induces a decomposition @xmath29 .",
    "also , @xmath30 c.   @xmath31 .",
    "the divisor @xmath32 is base - point free and defines a contraction to @xmath33 . also , @xmath34",
    "d.   if @xmath35 , @xmath1 is a @xmath33-bundle over @xmath36 .    in these cases @xmath1 is a mori dream space and the cox ring has the following presentation @xmath37/i\\]]where @xmath38 .    for very general hypersurfaces in @xmath15 of degree @xmath16 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 however , @xmath1 is _ not _ a mori dream space . here",
    "@xmath41 but the divisor @xmath42 has no effective multiple .",
    "note that mori dream hypersurfaces in @xmath15 have bidegrees @xmath16 lying in the l - shaped region given by @xmath43 .",
    "hence it is essentially the value of @xmath44 , rather than the anticanonical divisor , that determines whether a general hypersurface of degree @xmath16 is a mori dream space or not .",
    "in particular , it is not true that a sufficiently ample hypersurface in a mori dream space is again a mori dream space .    in this case that there are only a few bidegrees @xmath16 where @xmath1 is fano , in which case it is well - known that @xmath1 is a mori dream space .",
    "the case @xmath45 corresponds to a calabi - yau manifold . on the other hand , for general type varieties , when @xmath46 is ample , most hypersurfaces are not mori dream spaces ,",
    "although there are some that are ( e.g. , bidegree @xmath47 is a mori dream space , @xmath48 is not ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that all the cones involved are rational polyhedral for any bidegree .",
    "there is a corresponding result for surfaces in @xmath49 , but this requires a slightly modified argument , as the picard group of @xmath1 might be larger than that of the ambient space . nevertheless , using the noether - lefschetz theorem , we prove the following analogue of theorem [ decones ] for surfaces :    [ desurfaces ] let @xmath1 be a very general surface in @xmath49 of bidegree @xmath16 .",
    "a.   if @xmath50 , @xmath1 is the blow - up of @xmath12 along the intersection of two very general degree @xmath51 curves .",
    "it is a mori dream space if and only if @xmath52 , in which case @xmath1 is a del pezzo surface . in the other case , @xmath1 is a rational surface with infinitely many @xmath13-curves .",
    "b.   if @xmath53 , @xmath1 is a double cover of @xmath12 branched along a smooth curve of degree @xmath54 and is always a mori dream space . c.   if @xmath35 , @xmath1 is a hirzebruch surface .",
    "d.   if @xmath55 and @xmath40 , then the effective cone of @xmath1 is not closed .",
    "hence @xmath1 is not a mori dream space .",
    "proposition [ desurfaces ] gives a simple example of a line bundle @xmath56 which has positive intersection with every curve @xmath57 , but is not ample .",
    "more precisely , a very general surface of bidegree @xmath58 in @xmath49 has the line bundle @xmath59 which satisfies this condition .",
    "of course here @xmath56 has top - self - intersection 0 . in section 5",
    "we also construct higher dimensional analogues of this .",
    "examples of line bundles with such properties were first constructed by mumford using certain projective bundles @xmath60 over curves of genus @xmath61 .",
    "our geometric construction in theorem [ decones ] was inspired by mumford s example , but we use only projective bundles over elliptic curves .",
    "let @xmath1 be a @xmath4-factorial , normal hypersurface of @xmath2 where @xmath18 . in this case",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath1 is a mori dream space , by computing the cox ring of @xmath1 directly .",
    "indeed , let @xmath62 be any divisor on @xmath2 and consider the sequence @xmath63this is exact on the right because @xmath64 for any line bundle @xmath56 when @xmath18 .",
    "this shows that the cox ring of @xmath1 is a quotient of that of @xmath2 : @xmath65/(f),\\ ] ] where the grading is @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , the only contractions of @xmath1 are given by the two projections .",
    "in particular , this means that the questions mentioned in the introduction are only interesting for hypersurfaces in @xmath15 .",
    "here the situation becomes more complicated because the presence of higher cohomology makes it difficult to compute @xmath68 .",
    "in particular , we will see that the cox ring of @xmath1 is _ not _ a quotient of that of @xmath15 in these cases .    in general it is an interesting question when a sufficiently ample hypersurface in a mori dream space is again a mori dream space .",
    "this is not always the case , even for arbitrarily ample hypersurfaces , as shown by theorem [ decones ] . in the positive direction , hausen @xcite , jow @xcite and artebani - laface @xcite",
    "give criteria for when the cox ring of the hypersurface is a quotient of that of the ambient variety .",
    "a necessary condition for this to hold is that @xmath1 and @xmath10 have isomorphic picard groups . in @xcite",
    ", jow proves that @xmath69 for any smooth ample divisor @xmath1 on @xmath10 , provided @xmath10 is smooth of dimension @xmath70 , and @xmath71 has codimension at least 3 in @xmath72 . here",

    "throughout the paper we will be working over an uncountable algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 .",
    "the main reason for this is that some of the arguments used in section 5 requires working with _ very general _ hypersurfaces over _ general _ ones . here",
    "the latter will refer to the hypersurface being chosen outside a finite union of closed algebraic subsets of the parameter space , whereas ` very general ' means outside a countable union of closed algebraic subsets .",
    "we will also use properties of semistable vector bundles ( such as the fact that a symmetric power of a semistable vector bundle is again semistable ) , which are known to be false in positive characteristic . on the other hand",
    "it is likely that many of the results in section 2 and 3 can be extended to positive characteristic using the grothendieck ",
    "lefschetz theorem , which is known to hold in all characteristics .",
    "we let @xmath76 denote the nron - severi group of @xmath1 , i.e. , the @xmath77-vector space of divisors modulo numerical equivalence . for most of the varieties in this paper numerical and linear equivalence",
    "coincide , so that @xmath78 . inside @xmath76",
    "we define the effective cone @xmath79 to be the cone of all effective divisors .",

    "also thanks to laurent gruson , antonio laface , victor lozovanu , christian peskine , diane maclagan and kenji oguiso for useful discussions and comments .",
    "after this paper was written , we learned that some of the hypersurfaces in theorem [ decones ] were considered by ito in @xcite , who shows that they are mori dream spaces using a different argument .",
    "consider a hypersurface @xmath86 defined by a bihomogeneous form @xmath87where @xmath88 coordinates on @xmath36 and the @xmath89 are homogenous forms of degree @xmath51 in the coordinates @xmath90 on @xmath22 .",
