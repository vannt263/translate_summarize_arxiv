    "t dwarfs are brown dwarfs that exhibit methane absorption bands at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath1 @xcite , and thus have effective temperatures t@xmath3 @xmath4 1200 - 1300 k @xcite .",
    "the prototype for this class , gl 229b @xcite , was identified as a cool companion to the nearby m1v star gl 229a .",
    "recently , seven field objects @xcite and another companion object @xcite have also been identified as t dwarfs .",
    "the rapid discovery of these cool brown dwarfs has been driven by new sky surveys , such as the two micron all sky survey ( * ? ? ? * hereafter 2mass ) and the sloan digital sky survey @xcite ; and deep near - infrared surveys , such as the eso new technology telescope deep field @xcite .",
    "the t dwarfs identified to date are remarkably similar to gl 229b , with colors in the range @xmath50.2 @xmath4 j - k@xmath6 @xmath4 0.2 .",
    "near - infrared spectra are correspondingly similar @xcite , likely due to the saturation of h@xmath7o and ch@xmath2 bands that dominate this wavelength regime .",
    "subtle differences in the magnitudes and shapes of h- and k - band flux peaks are observed , due to increased ch@xmath2 , h@xmath7o , and h@xmath7 collision - induced absorption ( cia ) toward cooler effective temperatures @xcite , and variations in the depths of near - infrared h@xmath7o and ch@xmath2 bands are discerned when compared to gl 229b @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the similarity of the near - infrared spectra suggests that either the objects thus far identified are very similar in temperature , around 1000 k @xcite , or that near - infrared features are fairly insensitive to temperature , making the definition of a t dwarf spectral sequence in this wavelength regime a difficult proposition , at least at low resolution .",
    "we report the discovery of a t dwarf by 2mass which is unique among its counterparts , as it shows significant differences in its near - infrared features while retaining defining ch@xmath2 bands .",
    "this object , 2massi j0559191 - 140448 ( hereafter 2mass j0559 - 14 ) , is also 0.4 mag brighter than gl 229b and more than 1 mag brighter than the field t dwarfs discovered thus far .",
    "it is the first brown dwarf to be identified by the newly commissioned cornell massachusetts slit spectrograph ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter cormass ) , mounted on the palomar 60-inch telescope . in @xmath82",
    "we discuss the selection of 2mass j0559 - 14 from 2mass data and its spectral identification by cormass . in @xmath83",
    "we discuss the observed spectral features and argue that 2mass j0559 - 14 is a warm t dwarf , possibly close to the transition temperature between l and t spectral classes .",
    "we discuss the brightness of this object and its role in future spectroscopic investigation of the t dwarf class in @xmath84 .",
    "2mass j0559 - 14 was initially selected as a t dwarf candidate from the 2mass point - source working database .",
    "details on the selection criteria for 2mass t dwarfs are discussed in @xcite . using the palomar 60-inch infrared camera @xcite",
    ", we successfully re - imaged this candidate on 23 september 1999 ( ut ) at j - band , confirming it as a bona - fide candidate ( i.e. , not a minor planet or artifact ) .",
    "2mass j0559 - 14 is the brightest 2mass t dwarf candidate confirmed to date , with j = 13.83@xmath00.03 ( table 1 ) ; it is also the reddest candidate confirmed , with j - k@xmath6 = 0.22@xmath00.06 .",
    "optical serc - ej @xcite and j - band 2mass images of the 2mass j0559 - 14 field are shown in figure 1 ; no optical counterpart is seen to b@xmath9 @xmath10 23 .",
    "low - resolution near - infrared spectral data of 2mass j0559 - 14 were obtained on 24 october 1999 ( ut ) using cormass .",
    "this newly commissioned instrument is an r @xmath10 300 prism cross - dispersed near - infrared spectrograph , with a 256 @xmath11 256 nicmos3 array and a 40 lines mm@xmath12 grating , blazed at 4.8 @xmath1 .",
    "cormass was designed primarily for the spectral classification of candidate low - mass objects color - selected from the 2mass database . the instrument s echelle format provides simultaneous coverage of the _",
    "z_jhk bands , for 0.8 @xmath4 @xmath13 @xmath4 2.5 @xmath1 .",
    "the fixed slit has a width of 2@xmath14 and a length of 15@xmath14 .",
    "further details on this instrument can be found in @xcite .",
    "conditions during the observations were not photometric , and estimated seeing was @xmath10 1@xmath155 , with variable thin cirrus throughout the night .",
    "total on - source time was 2400 seconds divided into sets of 300-second integrations , nodding @xmath10 5@xmath14 along the slit between exposures .",
    "spectra were reduced using standard iraf routines .",
    "after correction for bad pixels , flat field and flux calibration images were corrected for nicmos3 reset - decay bias ( also known as shading ) as follows : a quadratic was fit to a row - by - row clipped median of the top quarter of the array , the portion unused by the spectrograph .",
    "the fit was extrapolated to 128 rows for the top two quadrants , duplicated for the bottom two quadrants , and subtracted row - by - row from all pixels .",
    "all images were flat - fielded with a pixel responsivity solution from the apflatten task using dome flats from all five nights of the run summed together",
    ". nodded image pairs for the science object were subtracted against each other to remove sky background and reset - decay bias .",
    "the apall task was used for spectral extraction .",
    "wavelength calibration was accomplished using spectral observations of the planetary nebula ngc 7027 obtained on 25 october 1999 ( ut ) .",
    "flux calibration was done by dividing by the reduced spectrum of the a2v standard hd 77281 @xcite , which was observed at similar airmass as 2mass j0559 - 14 and hand corrected for stellar h paschen and brackett recombination lines .",
    "the ratio was then multiplied by a 8810 k @xcite blackbody to complete the flux calibration .",
    "finally , all 300-second observations for each order were weighted by the spectra mean and combined with the scombine task using a trimmed average .",
    "orders were stitched together with scombine after hand deletion of noisy data at the ends of the orders .",
    "the spectrum of 2mass j0559 - 14 is shown in figure 2 , along with optical ( 0.87 - 1.0 @xmath1 ; burgasser et al .",
    "2000b ) and near - infrared ( 1.0 - 2.35 @xmath1 ; strauss et al .",
    "1999 ) data for sdssp j162414.37 + 002915.6 ( hereafter sdss 1624 + 00 ) .",
    "the combined sdss 1624 + 00 spectrum was smoothed to the resolution of cormass .",
    "spectra for both objects are normalized to one at 1.27 @xmath1 ( j - band peak ) .",
    "close up views of 0.88 - 1.01 and 1.15 - 1.345 @xmath1 are shown in figure 3 .",
    "table 2 summarizes the spectral features detected in 2mass j0559 - 14 , with identifications from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ". only major absorption bands of h@xmath7o and ch@xmath2 are tabulated .",
    "the characteristic ch@xmath2 bands at 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath1 are present , as are bands at 1.1 and 1.3 @xmath1 identified from laboratory data @xcite which are blended with h@xmath7o bands at the same wavelengths .",
    "an feh feature is seen at 0.9896 @xmath1 ( 0 - 0 band of a@xmath16@xmath17-x@xmath16@xmath17 ) which has also been identified in sdss 1624 + 00 @xcite .",
    "we do not detect the higher order 0 - 1 feh band at 1.191 @xmath1 , which is seen to weaken in the latest l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "two sets of k i doublets are noted at 1.1690 & 1.1773 @xmath1 ( 4p @xmath18p@xmath19 @xmath5 3d @xmath18d ) and 1.2432 & 1.2522 @xmath1 ( 4p @xmath18p@xmath19 @xmath5 5s @xmath18s ) , as is cs i at 0.8943 @xmath1 ( 6s @xmath18s@xmath20 @xmath5 6p @xmath18p@xmath20 ) .",
    "we do not detect the 2 - 0 x@xmath21@xmath22@xmath23-x@xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 band of co at 2.3 @xmath1 .",
    "comparison between 2mass j0559 - 14 and sdss 1624 + 00 reveals significant differences in spectral morphology . in figure 2",
    ", it is apparent that the slope between 0.9 and 1.05 @xmath1 is shallower in 2mass j0559 - 14 , likely due to decreased absorption by the pressure - broadened k i doublet at 0.7665 and 0.7699 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "ch@xmath2 and h@xmath7o features are generally weaker in 2mass j0559 - 14 , as noted by the significantly weakened 1.1 - 1.2 @xmath1 trough between @xmath24- and j - band peaks .",
    "the decreased ch@xmath2 opacity noticeably affects the shape of the j - band peak near 1.27 @xmath1 , as the weak ch@xmath2 wings at 1.24 and 1.30 @xmath1 carve out less flux on either side of the peak . in figure 2 ,",
    "a significant flux offset is readily apparent at the base of the 1.6 @xmath1 ch@xmath2 band in 2mass j0559 - 14 , and relative enhancement of flux at both h- and k - bands in this object is almost certainly due to decreased h@xmath7 cia ( 1 - 0 quadrupole ) , h@xmath7o , and ch@xmath2 opacity .",
    "the weak ch@xmath2 bands seen in 2mass j0559 - 14 are unique among the current sample of t dwarfs , and the reduced opacity can be most readily explained if this object is warmer than other known t dwarfs . at higher effective temperatures ,",
    "the dominant carbon - bearing species changes from co to ch@xmath2 at small optical depth , so that the ch@xmath2 column density will be less than that of cooler t dwarfs , and observed band strengths correspondingly weaker .",
    "increased thermal flux will also be seen at the base of these bands , particularly at 1.6 @xmath1 , which is unaffected by h@xmath7o absorption .",
    "the lower ch@xmath2 column density directly affects the h@xmath7o column density , via the reaction co + 3 h@xmath7 @xmath25 ch@xmath2 + h@xmath7o , leading to shallower bands at 1.1 and 1.45 @xmath1 .",
    "water can also be heated and dissociated by dust layers deep in the photosphere @xcite .",
    "finally , decreased h@xmath7 cia opacity at k - band , congruous with reduced ch@xmath2 and h@xmath7o opacity , will result in redder j - k@xmath6 colors with warmer t@xmath3 .",
    "these features are observed in 2mass j0559 - 14 , and its warm temperature is independently supported by the detection of the 0.9896 @xmath1 feh band , which is present but weakening in the latest l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "a similar argument has been made for sdss 1624 + 00 by @xcite , which was one of only three t dwarfs in that paper to show this feature .",
    "sdss 1624 + 00 has been shown to be a warm object via optical continuum measurements between broadened na i and k i features @xcite , while @xcite argue that this object is both warmer and dustier than gl 229b based on its shallower ch@xmath2 and h@xmath7o bands . by analogy , 2mass j0559 - 14 should be warmer still .",
    "the detection of excited k i lines at j - band , which are seen to weaken in the latest l dwarfs @xcite , is further evidence of the warmth of this object .",
    "the spectral features in 2mass j0559 - 14 suggest that it is close to the l / t transition temperature .",
    "the lack of co detection at 2.3 @xmath1 is not necessarily contradictory to this hypothesis , as overlying ch@xmath2 absorption beyond 2.2 @xmath1 may mask this weaker feature .",
    "naturally , metallicity , dust , and gravity could also play roles in the band strengths seen in 2mass j0559 - 14 ; however , temperature is likely to be the dominant determinant given the concordance of spectral features as discussed above .",
    "we can make a conservative t@xmath3 constraint for this object based on the temperature of gl 229b , which is clearly cooler , and a temperature estimate of the l8v companion dwarf gl 584c @xcite ; this translates into a range of 1000 @xmath4 t@xmath3 @xmath4 1300 k. parallax and bolometric luminosity measurements of this object would allow a direct determination of temperature .",
    "the relative brightness of 2mass j0559 - 14 as compared to other t dwarfs suggests that it may be a nearby brown dwarf .",
    "we can estimate its distance using simple scaling arguments based on gl 229b = 5.77@xmath00.04 pc @xcite , t@xmath3 = 960@xmath070 k @xcite , r @xmath26 r@xmath27 = 7.1 @xmath11 10@xmath28 cm @xcite , j = 14.32@xmath00.05 , l = ( 6.6@xmath00.6 ) @xmath11",
    "10@xmath29 l@xmath30 , and bc@xmath9 = 2.2@xmath00.1 @xcite . ] .",
    "first , if we assume this object has the same intrinsic luminosity as gl 229b , we estimate its distance to be 4.6 pc .",
    "however , 2mass j0559 - 14 is probably a warmer object than gl 229b , so it should be more distant .",
    "an alternate estimate can be made if we adopt a radius r @xmath26 r@xmath31 and bounding t@xmath3 @xmath4 1300 k , so that l @xmath4 2.2 @xmath11 10@xmath32 l@xmath30 . using a gl 229b bolometric correction",
    ", we obtain m@xmath9 @xmath33 14.2 and thus @xmath34 @xmath4 8.4 pc .",
    "note , however , that an l8v has m@xmath9 = 15.0 @xcite , implying that our bc@xmath9 value may be too high ; indeed , bc@xmath9 may be only 1.3 for an l8v @xcite . adopting a smaller bc@xmath9 yields a smaller distance .",
    "therefore , barring multiplicity , 2mass j0559 - 14 is probably 5 - 8 pc distant , and likely falls within the 8 pc nearby star sample defined by @xcite .",
    "the brightness of this object allows substantial follow - up over a broad wavelength range , particularly for @xmath13 @xmath35 2.5 @xmath1 , where the fundamental absorption bands of h@xmath7o ( 2.7 @xmath1 ) , nh@xmath36 ( 3.0 @xmath1 ) , ch@xmath2 ( 3.3 @xmath1 ) , h@xmath7s ( 3.8 @xmath1 ) , and co ( 4.7 @xmath1 ) are found .",
    "the latter 1 - 0 x@xmath21@xmath22@xmath23-x@xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 band of co can aid in constraining its atmospheric abundance @xcite , essential in testing hypotheses of mixing @xcite and transparency @xcite in t dwarf atmospheres .",
    "deuterated molecules , such as ch@xmath36d , are of interest for study in the 3 - 5 @xmath1 range , as they yield information on the deuterium burning history of these brown dwarfs .",
    "mid - infrared wavelengths ( 8 - 14 @xmath1 ) are sensitive to vibration - rotation bands of alkali chlorides and sulfides , which are more abundant than their atomic alkali counterparts at low temperatures and high pressures @xcite and may serve as excellent temperature discriminants .",
    "this region also contains the strong fundamental @xmath37@xmath7 band of nh@xmath36 ( 10.5 @xmath1 ) and various silicate features .",
    "additionally , optical spectra shortward of 0.9 @xmath1 are critical in determining the behavior of the alkalis in cool brown dwarfs , particularly pressure - broadened na i ( 0.5890 & 0.5896 @xmath1 ) and k i ( 0.7665 & 0.7699 @xmath1 ) doublets , and cs i lines at 0.8521 and 0.8943 @xmath1 , which may also be used as temperature discriminants @xcite .",
    "while these features have been seen in t dwarfs such as sdss 1624 + 00 @xcite , detailed investigation of li i ( 0.6708 @xmath1 ) and rb i ( 0.7800 & 0.7948 @xmath1 ) lines have been hampered by the lack of detectable flux at these wavelengths .",
    "investigation in this spectral regime is currently underway .",
