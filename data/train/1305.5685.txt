    "recent interest to transport investigations of the interface between a superconductor ( s ) and a low - dimensional semiconductor structure ( n ) is mostly stimulated by the search for majorana fermions  @xcite .",
    "the essential condition of this search  @xcite is the realization of the topological superconductivity near the sn interface .",
    "this regime is characterized  @xcite by spectrum modification in a low dimensional structure , caused by cooperation of a spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , zeeman energy @xmath1 , and the energy gap @xmath2 induced due to a proximity with s - wave superconductor .",
    "because of the spectrum modification , it seems to be quite reasonable  @xcite to study charge transport through a single sn interface , where the normal side is the edge of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with strong rashba - type spin - orbit coupling .",
    "by contrast to ref .  , where a good correspondence with standard btk theory  @xcite has been observed , we concentrate on a low - temperature limit , to extract features , specific to the strong so coupling .",
    "the so coupling induces an energy splitting @xmath3 which lifts the spin degeneracy , but the energy splitting does not break the time reversal symmetry unlike an exchange splitting in ferromagnet . even in the simplest case of a two - dimensional metal , the physics",
    "is expected to be quite sophisticated  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the problem is even more complicated because of a spin - hall effect  @xcite in a 2deg with rashba so coupling .",
    "m wide corner - shape mesa has a number of leads to ni - au ohmic contacts ( contacts are not in the image area ) .",
    "several superconducting ( nb or nbn ) stripes ( yellow , denoted by numbers ) are placed to overlap the mesa step at two perpendicular mesa edges . in every overlap region",
    ", a junction is formed between the superconducting film and the 2deg edge .",
    "the width of each junction is equal to 20  @xmath4 m .",
    "the junctions are separated by 2@xmath4 m distance .",
    "we study electron transport across one particular s-2deg junction in a three - point configuration : the corresponding superconducting electrode is grounded ( no .  6 in the figure ) , others are disconnected ; a current is applied between it and one of the ni - au ohmic contacts ; another ni - au contact traces the 2deg potential . [ sample ] ]    here , we experimentally investigate transport properties of a single junction between a superconductor and the edge of a two - dimensional electron system in a narrow @xmath0 quantum well with strong rashba - type spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we experimentally demonstrate suppression of andreev reflection in a small energy range within the superconducting gap . this suppression is shown to be independent of the superconductor material and the interface disorder .",
    "the effect is only present at lowest temperatures and magnetic fields , far from the corresponding critical values of a superconducting transition .",
    "we connect the observed suppression with a spin - hall effect due to a strong spin - orbit coupling on the normal side of the junction .",
    "our samples are grown by solid source molecular beam epitaxy on semi - insulating gaas substrates .",
    "the active layer is composed of a 20-nm thick @xmath0 quantum well sandwiched between a lower 50-nm thick and an upper 120-nm thick @xmath5 barriers .",
    "details on the growth parameters can be found elsewhere  @xcite . a 2deg , confined in a narrow asymmetric @xmath0 quantum well , is characterized  @xcite by strong rashba - type so coupling with rashba constant @xmath6 about @xmath7  evm .",
    "the 2deg mobility at 4k is @xmath8@xmath9/vs and the carrier density is @xmath10@xmath11 , as obtained from standard magnetoresistance measurements .     of a single nb-2deg junction as a function of the dc voltage drop @xmath12 across the junction .",

    "[ sample ] . in this case of nb electrodes ,",
    "the limit of intermediate ( @xmath13 ) scattering at the nb-2deg interface is realized , see ref .  .",
    "each curve demonstrates a well developed @xmath14 resistance peak at low bias . the peak width @xmath15  mv ( denoted by dashed lines )",
    "is the same for different nb-2deg junctions , so it is independent of the disorder at the interface .",
    "the inset demonstrates the enlarged region of normal resistance at @xmath16 for two perpendicular mesa edges .",

    "the 200 nm height mesa step is formed by wet chemical etching .",
    "two perpendicular mesa edges are oriented along @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] crystallographic directions .    in our @xmath0 structure",
    "a high quality edge contact to a 2deg can be realized by evaporation of a metal over the mesa step , without annealing procedure  @xcite .",
    "we thermally evaporate 10  nm ni and 100  nm au to obtain ( normal ) ohmic contacts .",
    "any of them is characterized by a strictly linear @xmath21 dependence at low temperatures with @xmath22 resistance .",
    "in addition , we use dc sputtering to place 100  nm thick niobium nb ( or 50  nm thick niobium nitride , nbn ) superconductor stripes to overlap with mesa edges , see fig .",
    "[ sample ] .",
    "the stripes are formed by lift - off technique , the surface is mildly cleaned in ar plasma before dc sputtering .",
    "as it is usual for the superconductor thin film sputtering , a critical temperature @xmath17 can be seriously affected by the substrate . to avoid the 2deg degradation ,",
    "the sputtering is performed at room temperature .",
    "the nb film is more robust : the superconducting gap @xmath23  mev obtained in fig .",
    "[ ivnb ] is in a good correspondence with the expected @xmath24  k. room temperature sputtered nbn films are known to be subjected to a fragmentation onto normal and superconducting regions under a mechanical stress , which should be important at the mesa step  @xcite .",

    "[ ivnbn ] demonstrates even smaller values at the mesa step .",
    "a junction is formed between the superconducting ( nb or nbn ) electrode and the 2deg at the mesa edge .",
    "we study electron transport across one particular s-2deg junction in a three - point configuration : a current is applied between one of the ni - au ohmic contacts and a superconducting electrode which is grounded ( contact 6 in fig .  [ sample ] ) while another ni - au contact measures the 2deg potential . to obtain @xmath25 characteristics",
    ", we sweep the dc current through the interface from -5  @xmath4a to + 5  @xmath4a .",
    "this dc current is modulated by a low ( 0.85  na ) ac ( 110  hz ) component .",
    "we measure both the dc ( @xmath12 ) and ac ( @xmath26 ) components of the 2deg potential by using a dc voltmeter and a lock - in amplifier , respectively .",
    "we have checked , that the lock - in signal is independent of the modulation frequency in the range 50  hz ",
    "this range is defined by applied ac filters . as usual in a three - point configuration , both @xmath12 and @xmath14 are determined by the ground contact , i.e. the measured @xmath25 curves reflect the behavior of the s-2deg interface .",
    "we verify this statement for our setup by demonstrating that the measured @xmath12 and @xmath14 are independent of a particular choice of current / voltage ohmic contacts in fig .",
    "[ sample ] for a fixed ground .",
    "the setup is also verified by obtaining a strictly linear @xmath25 curve if the superconductivity is suppressed by high magnetic field or temperature .",
    "the measurements were performed at a temperature of 30  mk .",
    "similar results were obtained from different samples of every type ( nb or nbn ) in several cooling cycles .",
    "the examples of @xmath14 characteristics are presented in figs .  [ ivnb],[ivnbn ] for two different superconductor materials , nb and nbn .",
    "for both cases , the differential resistance @xmath14 is still finite within the superconducting gap @xmath27 or @xmath28 and strongly non - linear .",
    "we check , that the superconductivity , and , therefore , any @xmath25 nonlinearity can be suppressed by the temperature or the magnetic field .",
    "the most important , we observe a well developed @xmath14 resistance peak at low biases , which can not be predicted by standard theories .    the main @xmath14 behavior can be well understood within the framework of standard btk theory  @xcite .",
    "finite resistance is only allowed because of andreev reflection , since a single - particle tunneling is prohibited within the superconducting gap .",
    "andreev reflection is essentially affected by a single - particle scattering at the interface , which can be characterized by a scattering potential strength @xmath29 .",
    "we can define the regime of andreev reflection by estimating @xmath29 through a single - particle transmission @xmath30 of the interface ( @xmath31 , see ref .  ) . from the junction normal resistance and the junction width we obtain @xmath32 for the nbn case and only @xmath33 for the nb junction , which corresponds to @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .    the main behavior of the @xmath14 characteristics in figs .",
    "[ ivnb],[ivnbn ] is in a good agreement with this @xmath29 estimation . in the case of nb electrode",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ ivnb ] ) , the scattering is dominant at the interface ( @xmath13 ) , so the differential resistance @xmath14 at @xmath36 is increased with respect to the normal value .",
    "@xcite this increase depends on a junction , because the andreev process requires two - particle co - tunneling and therefore is extremelly sensitive to the disorder . at higher voltages @xmath16 ,",
    "@xmath14 approaches the normal resistance value , which is approximately the same for the junctions placed at the same mesa edge , cp .",
    "junctions 5,6 and 4,7 in figs .",
    "[ sample ] ,  [ ivnb ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the normal resistance values are clearly different for two perpendicular @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] mesa edges , which reflects intrinsic in - plane mobility anisotropy of 2deg in @xmath0 structure  @xcite .     of a single nbn-2deg junction as a function of the dc current @xmath37 through the junction .",
    "the curves are denoted by the junction numbers , see fig .",
    "[ sample ] . in this case of nbn electrodes ,",
    "the limit of low ( @xmath38 ) scattering at the nbn-2deg interface is realized , see ref .  .",
    "in this case , because of low 2@xmath4 m junctions spacing , nbn-2deg - nbn two - point resistance ( dashed curve ) is of standard josephson behavior .",
    "each particular nbn-2deg junction demonstrates a clear visible @xmath14 resistance peak at low bias , similarly to nb-2deg case .",
    "by contrast , two - point nbn-2deg - nbn resistance has no peculiarities at low currents .",
    "[ ivnbn ] ]    in the case of nbn electrode ( see fig .",
    "[ ivnbn ] ) , the limit of low scattering ( @xmath38 ) at the s-2deg interface is realized , so the differential resistance @xmath14 is diminished  @xcite within the superconducting gap @xmath28 . while the curves in fig .",
    "[ ivnbn ] are qualitatively similar for two neighbor junctions , they demonstrate different normal resistance values , different drop in @xmath14 within the gap , and even different @xmath28 values .",
    "this indicates the presence of normal regions of nbn at the mesa step .",
    "@xcite in this case , the measured voltage @xmath12 is not directly a voltage drop at the s-2deg interface . for this reason , we draw @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ ivnbn ] as a function of a current @xmath37 through the junction which is unambiguously defined in our setup .",
    "we can be sure , however , that the qualitative @xmath14 behavior reflects the s-2deg interface properties .",
    "for example , because of low 2@xmath4 m junctions spacing and transparent interfaces , nbn-2deg - nbn two - point resistance ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ ivnbn ] ) is of standard josephson behavior .",
    "the most unexpected our experimental finding is a well developed @xmath14 resistance peak at low biases , which is present in both ( nb and nbn ) scattering regimes .",
    "the resistance peak indicates , that the andreev reflection is ( partially ) suppressed within a narrow energy region around zero bias .",
    "[ ivnb ] demonstrates that the @xmath14 peak width @xmath15  mv is universal for different nb-2deg junctions .",
    "similarly to nb-2deg case , every nbn-2deg junction demonstrates a clear visible @xmath14 resistance peak of a roughly constant width .",
    "we should conclude , that the central @xmath14 peak is independent of the disorder at the particular interface .",
    "it is important that two - point nbn-2deg - nbn josephson curve has no peculiarities at low currents .",
    "we find that the central @xmath14 peak is extremely sensitive to the magnetic field and the temperature , see fig .",
    "[ ivev ] . since the resistance peak is mostly prominent in fig .",
    "[ ivnb ] for nb electrodes , we only demonstrate this case below .",
    "the central @xmath14 peak disappears completely above @xmath39  t , see fig .",
    "[ ivev ] ( a ) .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath25 curve is clearly non - linear below the upper critical field @xmath40  t of a niobium film in a present magnetic field configuration .",
    "we use the in - plane oriented field to avoid orbital effects in the 2deg .",
    "[ ivev ] ( b ) demonstrates typical evolution of the @xmath25 curve with temperature .",
    "the @xmath14 resistance peak is gradually diminishing with the temperature increase and disappears completely at 0.88  k. by contrast , the curve itself is practically insensitive to the temperature below 0.88  k , as it can be expected because of much higher @xmath41  k in niobium .",
    "the characteristic values of the @xmath14 peak suppression ( 1.5  t and 0.88  k ) are also the same for the nbn-2deg junction .",
    "similarly to the nb case , @xmath25 curves are not affected below this values except for the central peak region .",
    "peak suppression by in - plane magnetic field ( a ) or temperature ( b ) in the case of a nb-2deg junction .",
    "the central @xmath14 peak disappears completely in 1.5  t , much before the upper critical field @xmath40  t in the present in - plane field configuration .",
    "the @xmath14 resistance peak also disappears completely at 0.88  k , while the @xmath25 curve is insensitive to the temperature up to this value .",
    "the curves in ( a ) panel are shifted vertically for clarity .",
    "let us highlight the most important experimental result : a strong increase of the resistance at low bias indicates a suppression of the andreev reflection within a narrow energy range .",
    "this suppression is very unusual , by contrast to widely observed andreev reflection enhancement in different systems , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "since the central @xmath14 peak is present for two different superconductor materials with clearly different s-2deg interface properties , the disorder at the interface can not be responsible for the quite universal @xmath14 behavior at low bias .",
    "we have to connect the observed @xmath14 peak with some 2deg - related effect , which is substantiated by the flat nbn-2deg - nbn josephson curve at low currents . the only relevant  @xcite energy scale in this case",
    "is the rashba so splitting  @xcite @xmath42  mev in the 2deg spectrum , where @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44 . in principle ,",
    "strong rashba - type so coupling affects the andreev reflection as predicted by calculation in ref .  .",
    "however , the effect is quite small , and ref .",
    "does not predict any low energy physics  @xcite .",
    "a clear physical explanation of our results can be connected with a spin - hall effect  @xcite , which has been directly demonstrated in our 2deg by using ferromagnetic side contacts  @xcite . in the case of a strong rashba - type so coupling",
    ", the electric current within the 2deg plane is expected to cause a non - zero , out - of - plane spin polarization ( spin accumulation ) @xmath45 near the sample edges even in zero magnetic field  @xcite . for a current , flowing through a s-2deg junction , out - of - plane spin polarization @xmath45",
    "is accumulated around the junction corners .",
    "andreev reflection is suppressed for transport from these regions to the nb ( nbn ) contact , because of broken usual requirements  @xcite for spin projections and energies of two electrons to be combined in a pair .",
    "the junction width is effectively diminished , which gives rise to the increased differential resistance @xmath14 around zero bias as shown in figs .",
    "[ ivnb ] and [ ivnbn ] . in picture the central @xmath14 peak width",
    "is determined by the chemical potential difference for spin - up and spin - down electrons and obviously independent of the disorder at the interface , as we observe in fig .",
    "[ ivnb ] . on the other hand , flat two - point nbn-2deg - nbn curve in fig .",
    "[ ivnbn ] supports the proposed explanation , since a zero - resistant josephson state is insensitive to the contact effective width .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the strong temperature dependence at @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ ivev ] ( b ) : if the temperature exceeds the value of the spin - orbit splitting @xmath47  mev , all the effects of the spin polarization disappear in the 2deg , and the interface resistance is diminished , as we do observe in fig .  [ ivev ] ( b ) at @xmath48  k. an in - plane magnetic field has a similar effect : in our @xmath0 quantum well the zeeman splitting exceeds  @xcite @xmath3 at @xmath49  t , so the spin - hall effect disappears , and the interface resistance is diminished , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ivev ] ( a ) .",
    "as a result , we experimentally investigate transport properties of a single junction between a superconductor and the edge of a two - dimensional electron system in a narrow @xmath0 quantum well with strong rashba - type spin - orbit coupling .",

    "the effect is only present at lowest temperatures and magnetic fields , far from the corresponding critical values of a superconducting transition .",
