    "coin flipping by telephone was first introduced with these words by manuel blum in 1981 : `` alice and bob [  ] have just divorced , live in different cities , want to decide who gets the car ''  @xcite .",
    "they agree that the best thing to do is to flip a coin , but neither of them trusts the other and they are unable to agree on a mutually trusted third party to do the flip for them .",
    "more generally , coin - flipping protocols ( also known as `` coin - tossing '' ) can be used whenever two players need to pick a random bit even though it could be to the advantage of one of them ( or  perhaps both ) to choose , or at least bias , the outcome of the protocol .",
    "the original coin - flipping protocol introduced by blum is _ asynchronous _ in the sense that it consists of a sequence of rounds in which the two players alternate in sending messages to each other .",
    "the security of blum s protocol depends on the assumed difficulty of factoring large numbers .",
    "such an assumption is of course of little value in our quantum world , owing to peter shor s algorithm  @xcite , but classical coin flipping can be based on more general one - way functions , which could potentially be immune to quantum attacks . nevertheless , any coin - flipping protocol that takes place by the asynchronous transmission of classical messages has the property that one of the has complete control over the outcome , given sufficient computing power . in  the best case",
    ", such protocols can be computationally secure , and even _ that _ depends on unproven computational complexity assumptions .",
    "unconditionally secure classical coin - flipping protocols are possible in the _ synchronous _ model , in which the players are requested to send messages to each other with sufficient simultaneity to force their complete independence .",
    "such protocols are called _ relativistic _ because special relativity must be invoked to prevent alice from to receive bob s message before choosing her own ( and  vice versa ) .",
    "relativistic protocols must be implemented carefully their security depends crucially on the physical distance between the players , and either of them could try to fool the other by pretending to be away than they really are .",
    "such cheating can be thwarted if each player has a trusted agent near the other player  @xcite . for the rest of this paper , we only consider asynchronous protocols and `` coin - flipping '' will systematically mean `` asynchronous coin - flipping '' .    in _ quantum _ coin - flipping protocols , alice and bob",
    "are allowed to exchange quantum states .",
    "such protocols were first investigated in 1984 by charles h. bennett and gilles brassard  @xcite . in  that paper ,",
    "a protocol was presented and it was shown that `` ironically [ it ] can be subverted by use of a still subtler quantum phenomenon , the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox '' , making it the first use of entanglement  @xcite in quantum cryptography .",
    "we  shall refer to it henceforth as the `` bb84 protocol '' ( not to be confused with the better - known quantum key distribution protocol introduced in the same paper ) .",
    "the question was left open : can there be a perfect quantum coin - flipping protocol ?",
    "the  proof that this is impossible was given more than a decade later by hoi - kwong lo and hoi fung chau  @xcite , whose result was further clarified by mayers , louis salvail and yoshie chiba - kohno  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if quantum coin - flipping protocols can not be perfect , can they at least be better than anything classically possible ?    to make this question more precise",
    ", we say that one player enjoys an if a cheating strategy exists by which that player could choose either bit and influence the outcome of the protocol to be that bit with probability at least  @xmath0 , assuming that the other player follows the protocol honestly .",
    "this definition is _ unconditional _ in the sense that we allow the would - be cheater to enjoy unlimited computational power and a technology limited only by the laws of physics .",
    "the  _ bias _ of a protocol is the largest value of  @xmath1 so that at least one player an .",
    "a  _ perfect _ protocol would be one whose bias is  @xmath2 , but they can not exist , classical or quantum . at  the other end of the spectrum , a protocol",
    "whose bias is  @xmath3 is considered to be _ completely broken_. all  classical protocols are completely broken by this definition , and so is the bb84 quantum protocol .",
    "the question at the end of the previous paragraph was therefore : is  there a quantum coin - flipping protocol whose bias is strictly less than  @xmath3 ? = + 1    the first such protocol was discovered in 2000 by dorit aharonov , amnon ta - shma , umesh vazirani and andrew c .- c .",
    "yao  @xcite , who proved that the bias of their protocol ( atvy ) is at most ( without any claim concerning the tightness of their bound ) .",
    "it  was subsequently proven by robert w. spekkens and terry rudolph  @xcite that the atvy protocol is even better than its inventors had thought : its bias is in fact exactly . in  the same paper , spekkens and",
    "rudolph gave an amazingly simple coin - flipping protocol that achieves the same bias as well as another one whose bias is merely . according to an earlier paper of theirs  @xcite , that s the smallest bias possible for a coin - flipping protocol in which the quantum communication is limited to a single qubit .",
    "meanwhile , andris ambainis  @xcite and , independently , spekkens and rudolph  @xcite discovered quantum coin - flipping protocols whose bias  @xmath4 is even smaller , but they require the transmission of a qu__trit _ _ ( or  one qubit and two qutrits in the case of spekkens and rudolph ) .",
    "on  the other hand , alexei kitaev  @xcite proved that no quantum coin - flipping protocol can have a bias below . very recently , andr chailloux and iordanis kerenidis  @xcite have announced a quantum coin - flipping protocol whose bias is arbitrarily close to kitaev s bound , but it requires an unlimited number of rounds of interaction as it this bound .    despite the theoretical success of quantum coin - flipping protocols , compared to classical protocols , severe practical problems inherent to their implementation have been discussed by jonathan barrett and serge massar  @xcite , who argued that quantum coin flipping is problematic in any realistic scenario in which noise and loss can occur in the processing ( preparation , transmission and measurement ) of quantum information .",
    "for this reason , they proposed random bit-_string _ generation of _ single - shot _ coin flipping .",
    "however , this is not interesting from a quantum cryptographic perspective the same goal can be achieved with purely classical means  @xcite .    in  a subsequent paper ( nfpm ) written in collaboration with anh tuan nguyen , julien frison and kien phan huy",
    ", massar has defined a _ figure of merit _ on which quantum coin - flipping protocols can outperform any possible classical protocol even in a realistic setting and they have verified their concept experimentally  @xcite . even though their protocol is not broken in the presence of loss ,",
    "however , alice can choose the outcome with near certainty in a realistic setting .",
    "we  claim that , in order to be of practical use , a protocol should be _ loss tolerant _ , which we define as being completely impervious to loss of quantum information . in  this sense , the nfpm protocol is not loss tolerant because its bias increases asymptotically towards 0.5 as losses more and more severe , which is unavoidable in practice ( with current technology ) over increasing distance between alice and bob .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on this most likely source of imperfection in actual implementations , namely _",
    "losses_. with the exception of the nfpm protocol mentioned above ( which is not loss tolerant ) , all  previously proposed quantum coin - flipping protocols _",
    "completely _ insecure even in the absence of noise as soon as the quantum channel between alice and bob is lossy .",
    "we  introduce the first loss - tolerant quantum coin - flipping protocol .",
    "we  prove that our protocol is _ fair _ in the sense that either alice or bob can enjoy a bias of exactly @xmath5 with an optimal cheating strategy , independently of the channel s transmission and other sources of losses , provided quantum information that is not lost is prepared , transmitted and measured faithfully .",
    "after this introduction , the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we  begin in section  [ bb84:prot ] with a review of the original 1984 quantum coin - flipping protocol of bennett and brassard  @xcite and we explain why it is completely vulnerable to a so - called epr - attack . this is interesting not only for historical reasons , but also because our novel loss - tolerant protocol follows the same template .",
    "section  [ ambprot ] reviews perhaps the most famous of all quantum coin - flipping protocols , due to ambainis  @xcite , whose theoretical bias is @xmath4 .",
    "however , we demonstrate in section  [ ambweak ] that the security of that protocol is completely compromised in the presence of arbitrarily small channel loss . moreover , we argue that this problem is to the protocol in the sense that it can not be with small corrections .",
    "( the same would be true of the qutrit - based coin - flipping protocol due to spekkens and rudolph  @xcite as well as of their optimal single - qubit protocol  @xcite . )",
    "this is due to the notion of _ conclusive measurements _ , which we review in section  [ mmt ] .",
    "we  show in section  [ ourprot ] how to combine the strengths of the original bb84 protocol with those of the atvy protocol ( which is not loss tolerant either in its published form ) to finally achieve loss tolerance in quantum coin flipping and we analyse the security of our protocol .",
    "conclusions and open problems are presented in section  [ concl ] .",
    "we review the original bb84 quantum coin - flipping protocol as well as the way it can be broken  @xcite . here",
    "are the so - called bb84 states : @xmath6{\\large x}}{| \\psi_{0,1}\\rangle}={| 1\\rangle}\\phantom{{| + \\rangle}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\cr \\end{array}\\right\\ } & & a=0\\nonumber\\\\[1ex ] \\left .",

    "[ stepsix ] if bob did not abort the protocol , the outcome of the coin flip is , where `` @xmath14 '' denotes the sum modulo  @xmath15 ( also known as the `` exclusive  or '' ) .    in this protocol , bob can not cheat at all .",
    "the only strategy for a cheating bob would be to make an educated guess on alice s choice of  @xmath8 before deciding on the  @xmath13 to send her at step  [ steptwo ] , so as to bias the coin - flip outcome .",
    "however , @xmath8 corresponds to alice s random choice of basis .",
    "hence , the state @xmath16 received by bob at step  [ stepone ] is either or .",
    "it  follows from the fact that that it is impossible for bob to guess the value of @xmath8 better than at random .    on the other hand , it is obvious that alice can bias the protocol if she does not mind the risk of being called a cheater .",
    "the simplest approach is to be honest in the first step . when she receives @xmath13 from bob , the probability is @xmath17 that she is happy with the outcome , in which case she proceeds honestly with the protocol .",
    "on  the other hand , if she is unhappy with , she can lie on  @xmath8 at step  [ stepfour ] and send a random  @xmath9 . in  that case ,",
    "her probability of being caught is  @xmath18 since bob chose with probability  @xmath17 , in which case he obtained also with probability  @xmath17 .",
    "all  counted , this allows her to a .",
    "a  slightly more interesting cheat is for her to send state for a random at step  [ stepone ] and declare the @xmath8 that suits her wish ( with the appropriately chosen  @xmath9 ) at step  [ stepfour ] .",
    "this her to enjoy a bias of , with a probability of being called a cheater .",
    "it  was to make the probability of undetected cheating exponentially small that the full bb84 protocol required the transmission and measurement of a large number of qubits  @xcite .",
    "a much more remarkable kind of cheating is possible for alice , as explained in the same paper that introduced the bb84 protocol itself  @xcite , which allows her to break the protocol completely ( i.e.  enjoy a ) with no fear of ever being caught .",
    "let  us say she wishes the outcome of the coin flip to be bit  @xmath19 . instead of sending a legitimate bb84 state or any other pure state at step  [ stepone ]",
    ", alice sends half an epr pair to bob and keeps the other half for herself .",
    "she  waits until step  [ steptwo ] , when she learns bob s choice of  @xmath13 , to measure in basis the half she had kept ; let  @xmath9 be her measurement outcome .",
    "this tells her that bob has obtained ( or  will obtain , if he has not yet measured ) @xmath20 in case he has measured ( or will measure ) in basis  @xmath8 .",
    "( alice does not care about the value of @xmath12 if bob chooses to measure in the other basis . ) hence , she can always obtain her desired outcome by sending those @xmath8 and @xmath12 to bob in step  [ stepfour ] .",
    "= + 1    as subsequently discovered independently by mayers @xcite and by lo and chau  @xcite in the context of quantum bit commitment , this kind of cheating is _ always _ possible for alice in any quantum coin - flipping protocol that has the structure of the bb84 protocol , regardless of the actual set of quantum states , whenever the density matrices used to signal or at step  [ stepone ] are identical ( ) .",
    "this is due to the striking quantum process known as `` '' , discovered by erwin schrdinger  @xcite as early as 1936 and better known as the hjw  @xcite .",
    "( see  ref .",
    "@xcite for an entertaining history of this . )",
    "note that the remote steering attack works just as well if bob postpones his measurement until after alice reveals @xmath8 and  @xmath9 , and _ almost _ just as well if @xmath21 and @xmath22 , although different , are exponentially indistinguishable  @xcite .",
    "this last remark caused the demise of the bit commitment scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and we shall henceforth not differentiate between density matrices that are equal and those that are merely exponentially indistinguishable .",
    "in order to escape the remote steering attack , aharonov , ta - shma , vazirani and yao  @xcite introduced a coin - flipping protocol in which  . to  reduce even further alice s possible bias , they shuffled the order of steps  [ stepthree ] , [ steptwo ] and  [ stepfour ] so that bob delays his measurement of alice s supplied state until after she tells him what she claims to have sent . in  this way , he can measure systematically in the basis rather than having to measure in a randomly chosen basis  @xmath23 whose outcome had probability @xmath17 of being useless .",
    "this allowed atvy to design a quantum coin - flipping protocol with bias , as subsequently proven by spekkens and rudolph  @xcite .    to  achieve his smaller bias of  @xmath4 , ambainis used the following states on qutrits ( rather than on qubits ) : @xmath24{\\large x}}{| \\phi_{0,1}\\rangle}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}{| 0\\rangle}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}{| 1\\rangle}\\cr \\end{array}\\right\\ } & & a=0\\nonumber\\\\[1ex ] \\left .",

    "here is ambainis protocol .    1 .   [ astepone ] alice prepares one of the four ambainis states @xmath25 with basis @xmath8 and bit @xmath9 chosen independently at random ; she transmits that qutrit to bob , who stores it in his quantum memory .",
    "[ asteptwo ] bob sends a randomly chosen bit @xmath13 to alice .",

    "[ astepfour ] bob takes alice s qutrit out of quantum memory and measures it in basis  @xmath27 ; let bob s result be  @xmath12 .",
    "if , bob aborts the protocol , _ calling alice a cheater_. 6 .",
    "[ astepsix ] if bob did not abort the protocol , the outcome of the coin flip is .",
    "alice can not use remote steering to gain complete control over the outcome of the coin flip because the density matrices that could be by bob at step  [ astepone ] , corresponding to her choice @xmath8 of basis , @xmath28 are distinct .",
    "it is easy to see that alice can enjoy a if she sends state at step  [ astepone ] and declares @xmath8 and @xmath9 appropriately at step  [ astepthree ] .",
    "the proof that this is alice s optimal cheating strategy is nontrivial but has been worked out in detail by ambainis  @xcite . on  the other hand , the fact that makes it possible for bob to cheat by measuring alice s qutrit before step  [ asteptwo ] in order to learn information about @xmath8 and bias his choice of  @xmath13 accordingly .",
    "the most obvious strategy for bob is to measure alice s qutrit in the computational basis , which allows him to enjoy a as well .",
    "the fact that this is bob s optimal cheating strategy follows directly from carl w. helstrom s optimal measurement theory  @xcite , which we review in section  [ mmt ] .    for completeness",
    ", we mention that the independently - discovered quantum coin - flipping protocol of spekkens and rudolph  @xcite requires alice to choose a random bit  @xmath8 , prepare a one - qubit - and - two - qutrit entangled state @xmath29 and send bob one of the two qutrits in step  [ astepone ] .",
    "step  [ asteptwo ] is the same as in ambainis protocol . in  step  [ astepthree ] , alice sends the qubit and the other qutrit to bob , which allows him to verify her honesty in step  [ astepfour ] by performing a povm on the combined alice - provided state whose outcome is either @xmath30 , @xmath31 or `` alice cheated '' .",
    "again , the result of the coin flip is provided bob did not catch alice cheating . the essential ( but not sufficient ) reason why this protocol gives the same bias as ambainis",
    "is that the density matrix @xmath16 received by bob at step  [ astepone ] is exactly the same in both protocols , as given by eq .",
    "( [ rhoamb ] ) .",
    "even though ambainis analysis of his protocol is mathematically impeccable , there is a practical problem that can not be neglected if one is ever to implement such protocols in real life : there will be unavoidable losses in the quantum channel between alice and bob .",
    "this is true in particular if photons are used to carry quantum information and if the quantum channel is an optical .",
    "further losses are to be expected in bob s quantum memory and detection apparatus .",
    "the situation is even worse for the protocol of spekkens and rudolph because it requires both alice and bob to have quantum memory since they must store one qutrit each between steps [ astepone ] and  [ astepthree ] ( there is no real need for alice to store also the qubit since it contains only classical information )",
    ". please remember that one of the main appeals of quantum cryptography , from its very beginnings  @xcite , has been to offer protocols _ that can be implemented with current technology _ , yet remain secure against any potentially future attack so long as quantum mechanics is not violated .",
    "it  follows that there is a possibility , when bob tries to measure alice s qutrit at step  [ astepfour ] of ambainis protocol ( or the one - qubit - two - qutrit system in the protocol of spekkens and rudolph ) , that he does not register anything _ even though both alice and bob have been entirely honest_. how should bob react in this case ? he  could hardly call alice a cheater if the most likely cause for loss is in his own detectors ! there seem to be only two reasonable responses from bob , as pointed out already by barrett and massar  @xcite concerning a quantum coin - flipping protocol inspired by the quantum gambling protocol of won young hwang , doyeol ahn and sung woo hwang  @xcite : bob can ( 1 )  accept alice s declared @xmath8 and @xmath9 on faith or ( 2 )  request alice to restart the coin - flipping protocol from scratch . but both these `` solutions '' are unacceptable .    if alice knows that bob will believe her on faith in case he gets no detection signal , she can totally bias the coin flip with the most maddeningly simple cheating strategy : she does _ nothing _ at all during step  [ astepone ] and lets bob `` store '' the empty signal .",
    "after having received bob s choice of  @xmath13 , she is then free to `` reveal '' whichever @xmath8 would produce her desired outcome  . since bob s measurement of the empty signal will yield nothing at step  [ astepfour ]",
    ", he has no other choice but to believe alice on faith .    on the other hand ,",
    "if alice and bob have agreed to restart the coin - flipping protocol in case bob does not detect anything at step  [ astepfour ] , it is bob who can totally bias the coin flip without any need to manipulate quantum states . whenever he receives alice s qutrit , he does nothing at all with  it and sends his random choice of  @xmath13 . if  alice reveals @xmath8 at step  [ astepthree ] so that he is happy with outcome , with probability  @xmath17 , bob pretends to measure alice s long - lost qutrit and claims to be satisfied with her honesty . but",
    "if he is not happy with the outcome , bob simply tells alice that he has not registered anything and requests a new instance of the protocol .",
    "this continues until the outcome is to bob s liking .",
    "this cheating strategy can not be detected by alice whenever the expected probability @xmath32 of registering an outcome when both alice and bob are honest is at most  @xmath17 , provided bob asks to restart the protocol with probability even when progressing to step  [ astepsix ] would have produced his desired outcome .",
    "unless bob has the technological ability to make sure he received a quantum state from alice at step  [ astepone ] without disturbing  it , and because alice will not accept to restart the protocol after she has revealed @xmath8 and @xmath9 , he has only one line of defence against her `` send  nothing '' cheating strategy : he  must measure alice s signal immediately upon reception and be allowed to ask her to restart the protocol from scratch ( with an independent random choice of state ) until he actually registers a measurement outcome .",
    "this means that we must revert to the original bb84 template in which bob measures before alice reveals @xmath8 and  @xmath9 .    as  explained at the beginning of section  [ ambprot ] , this will make it easier for a cheating alice to escape detection since bob s measurement can no longer depend on her claimed state .",
    "however , provided bob chooses his measurement basis at random , he will carry out with probability @xmath17 the same measurement he would have performed in ambainis original protocol . as  we prove in subsection  [ bobhonest ] , it follows that bob s probability of catching alice s eventual cheating is reduced , but not by more than a factor of  2 , compared to the original protocol .",
    "hence , alice s bias is at most  @xmath33 rather than  @xmath4 .",
    "the important point is that this bias remains below  @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , this modification in ambainis protocol , which is made necessary by practical considerations ( with current technology ) , reopens the door for bob to completely break the revised protocol ! when alice tells him she transmitted a qutrit , bob measures it immediately in the computational basis .",
    "if  he obtains @xmath34 or @xmath35 , bob _ knows _ alice s choice of  @xmath8 .",
    "this allows him to choose @xmath13 so that suits his desired outcome . on  the other hand",
    ", if bob either obtains  @xmath36 or  if he does not register anything , then he tells alice that the transmission has been unsuccessful and he qutrit from her . in  effect",
    ", the protocol will proceed to the step in which bob sends his choice of @xmath13 to alice _ only _ when he already knows alice s choice of  @xmath8 .",
    "this means that bob enjoys a bias of  @xmath3 and the protocol is completely broken .",
    "to  camouflage his ( in  case alice might wonder why the measurement does not succeed more often ) , bob can pretend at the outset that his detectors are half as efficient as they really are .",
    "alternatively , he could surreptitiously replace the quantum channel that links him to alice with a sufficiently better one .",
    "this fatal flaw in any practical implementation of ambainis protocol comes from one simple consideration . even though the mixed states @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( see  eq .",
    "[ rhoamb ] ) used at step  [ astepone ] by alice to partially commit to either or , respectively , are non - orthogonal , hence they can not be distinguished with certainty by bob all the time , _ they can be distinguished conclusively with positive probability_. below the notion of conclusive measurements , we introduce our new protocol in section  [ ourprot ] and prove that its bias is exactly @xmath5 even when arbitrarily severe losses are taken into account .",
    "consider two non - orthogonal density matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( they could be pure states ) .",
    "there are several figures of merit in measurements that attempt to distinguish them  @xcite .",
    "helstrom has studied the optimal measurement to output a guess that minimizes the error probability  @xcite .",
    "assuming both @xmath21 and @xmath22 were equally likely _ a  priori _ , helstrom s measurement outputs the correct guess with probability @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the _ trace distance _ between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , `` @xmath39 '' denotes the trace and . in  particular , if @xmath40 is a diagonal real matrix , then .    when the spans of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are distinct , there another type of measurement , known as _ conclusive _ measurement or",

    "inconclusive outcome_. whenever outcome is obtained , it is guaranteed that the measured state was indeed  @xmath16 ( assuming of course that is was either @xmath21 or  @xmath22 and that there were no experimental errors ) . furthermore , the probability of a _ conclusive _ outcome ( not  `` ? '' )  must be strictly positive for either input state",
    ".    a well - known example of conclusive measurement can distinguish between @xmath36 and @xmath42 with conclusive outcome probability .",
    "more to the point of our paper , the obvious measurement in computational basis distinguishes between ambainis @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( eq .",
    "[ rhoamb ] ) with conclusive probability  @xmath17 . in  general ,",
    "any coin - flipping protocol that follows the template of bb84 is vulnerable to the attack described in section  [ ambweak ] when a conclusive measurement exists between the corresponding @xmath21 and  @xmath22 .",
    "it is tempting to think that this line of attack will not apply when conclusive measurements do not .",
    "however , this is not necessarily the case .",
    "erika , stephen m. barnett , chefles , sarah croke , claire r. gilson and john jeffers have studied `` maximum confidence quantum measurements '' ( mcqm ) , which somehow interpolate between helstrom and conclusive measurements  @xcite . like conclusive measurements ,",
    "mcqms have some probability of yielding the `` ? '' inconclusive outcome .",
    "however , when the outcome is either `` @xmath2 '' or `` @xmath41 '' , it is correct with probability at least .",
    "helstrom s measurement maximizes @xmath43 subject to whereas conclusive measurements ( when they ) minimize @xmath32 subject to .",
    "there can be a trade - off between those two probabilities in the sense that it is sometimes possible to achieve an increase in  @xmath43 ( compared to the accuracy of helstrom s measurement ) by tolerating a larger  @xmath32 .",
    "the relevance of mcqms is that bob could use them to increase his coin - flip bias at the cost of increasing his probability of asking alice to restart the protocol ( pretending he has not registered an outcome ) .",
    "if  mcqms exist for @xmath43 arbitrarily close to  @xmath41 , bob can come as near as he wants to choosing the coin - flip outcome , provided alice has enough patience ( navety ? )  to accept restarting the protocol indefinitely until bob tells her that he is ready to continue .    to demonstrate that this is a legitimate worry ,",
    "consider an ( admittedly contrived ) quantum coin - flipping protocol based on ambainis states ( see  the beginning of section  [ ambprot ] ) , except that we add and . in  step  [ astepone ] ,",
    "alice chooses basis at random with uniform probability , but is chosen so that whereas . the density matrix received by bob would be either @xmath44 these two mixed states can not be distinguished conclusively .",
    "nevertheless , a measurement in the computational basis yields either @xmath36 , which is interpreted as the inconclusive outcome  `` ? '' , or it yields either @xmath34 or @xmath35 , which are interpreted as either @xmath45 or @xmath46 , respectively .",

    "[ rhoamb ] ) , this time @xmath58 and @xmath59 can not be distinguished conclusively , nor even by a maximum confidence quantum measurement better than helstrom s measurement , which is the key to loss tolerance .",
    "although we have presented our protocol as a modification of the original bb84 protocol , it is useful for analysis purposes to contrast it also with the atvy protocol .",
    "the key difference between the atvy protocol and ours is that they chose to introduce a new template ( used in most subsequent protocols such as ambainis ) in which bob stores the quantum state sent by alice at step  [ nstepone ] in order to delay measurement until alice has given him its classical description .",
    "the intention was to make it harder for alice to cheat because bob would know to measure the state in basis  @xmath61 rather than to choose a random basis  @xmath55 .",
    "unfortunately , as we have explained , it was this feature that made their protocol incapable of tolerating channel loss unless bob has the technological ability to detect if a signal has been received by alice without otherwise disturbing its state .",

    "we  conclude that the choice of @xmath51 and @xmath52 that makes those two biases equal corresponds to a fair protocol whose bias is  0.4 .",
    "it would be relatively easy to determine alice s optimal cheating strategy were she restricted to sending some pure state to bob in the first step of the protocol .",

    "this could increase her chances of deciding on her best choice of @xmath8 and @xmath9 to `` reveal '' at step  [ nstepfour ] in order to maximize her probability of successfully biasing the coin flip .",
    "it  is significantly more complicated to take all possible such strategies into account .",
    "fortunately , most of the work has already been done by spekkens and rudolph in their thorough analysis of the atvy protocol  @xcite .",
    "let us begin our analysis by briefly pretending that bob does not measure the state alice has sent him after she reveals her choice of basis and bit , and that he measures it in that basis . as we have already pointed out , this becomes the atvy protocol .",

    "( this is how we make our protocol loss tolerant . )",
    "this difference makes it easier for alice to cheat because bob s measurement can not be chosen to maximize his probability of discriminating between her claimed state and any other state that she might have sent .",
    "however , as we show below , this modification does not reduce bob s probability of catching alice cheating by more than a factor of  @xmath15 .",
    "recall that bob is required by step  [ nstepthree ] of the protocol to send a _",

    "the crucial observation is that the randomness of  @xmath13 deprives alice from any information she might otherwise have obtained from bob concerning @xmath23 and  @xmath12 .",
    "( the  importance of this observation is illustrated in section  [ cunning ] . )",
    "it  follows that her choice of which @xmath8 and @xmath9 to declare at step  [ nstepfour ] can not depend on what has happened at bob s after she transmitted her quantum state at step  [ nstepone ] . in  particular , with probability  @xmath17 since @xmath23 is chosen at random by an honest bob , in which case he has chosen by chance at step  [ nsteptwo ] precisely the measurement he would have performed in the atvy protocol , had he been allowed to wait until alice s announcement of @xmath8 and @xmath9 before deciding on his measurement .",
    "the above implies that any cheating strategy that alice might deploy against our protocol translates into an _",
    "identical _ cheating strategy against the atvy protocol , possibly with a different success probability , since it makes no measurable difference to alice whether bob measures before ( as in our protocol ) or after ( as in the atvy protocol ) she has to declare @xmath8 and  @xmath9 .",

    ", we would `` normally '' conclude that bob s maximal bias is .    as  we have seen , however , this approach is not appropriate in our context because it does not take into the eventual possibility for bob to increase his bias by making conclusive or maximum confidence quantum measurements on the state sent by alice at step  [ nstepone ] , so that he could ask her to restart the protocol whenever he is not sufficiently satisfied with the probability that his guess of @xmath9 be correct .",

    "may have chosen in step  [ nstepone ] , eq .",
    "( [ rhonous ] ) shows the mixed state @xmath75 that bob would receive from her .",
    "the key observation is that , algebraically speaking , and .",
    "it  follows that , from a cheating bob s perspective , whose only concern is in guessing  @xmath9 as best as possible ( including the possibility of asking alice to restart the protocol if he is not satisfied with his own confidence in his guess ) , this is _ strictly identical _ to an alternative scenario in which alice would have sent @xmath36 with probability @xmath74 or @xmath34 with probability @xmath76 in case , and vice versa in case  . in  other words , this is exactly as if alice had communicated her choice of  @xmath9 to bob as the _ purely classical _ signal @xmath77 through a binary symmetric channel with error probability  @xmath76 .",
    "seen this way , there is _ nothing quantum _ about the situation .",
    "hence , a complete measurement in the computational basis of the state received by alice provides bob with an optimal cheating strategy since it yields _ all _ the information classically available in the `` quantum '' signal !",

    "either player can obtain a desired outcome with probability @xmath82 by using an optimal cheating strategy , provided of course the other player is honest .",
    "but  what if they both try to cheat ?",
    "an interesting phenomenon is illustrated if we take the unusual step of considering the case when both alice and bob cheat .",
    "the most example of double - cheating occurs when alice is convinced that bob is so greedy that he will try his best to control the coin flip . in  this case",
    ", alice can send an honest quantum state in step  [ nstepone ] . to  maximize his chances of guessing alice s choice of  @xmath9 , bob measures the state in the computational basis , as we have seen .",
    "this allows him to send alice a value of  @xmath13 that produces his desired outcome with probability @xmath82 ( assuming they use the fair version of the protocol ) .",
    "but at the same time , he has lost his ability to verify the honesty of alice since he did not measure her qubit in a legitimate basis . suspecting this , alice is free to claim whatever suits her best at step  [ nstepfour ] , probably lying about  @xmath9 , and bob",
    "can not look her in the face and call her a cheater !    for an amusing variation on this theme , consider what happens if both parties attempt to perform their optimal cheating strategies simultaneously .",
    "in  this case , alice sends either @xmath42 or  @xmath83 , which bob measures in basis .",
    "when bob attempts influencing the coin flip by choosing @xmath84 as a function of his measurement outcome , little does he suspect that his choice is in fact totally random : ironically , bob follows the honest protocol at step  [ nstepthree ] !",
    "= -1    for a more subtle example , consider a scenario according to which bob is alice s young son .",
    "they agree to flip a quantum coin to determine who will decide on the film to be seen tonight : alice will have the choice if the outcome is  @xmath41 and bob if it is  @xmath2 .",
    "alice knows that her little rascal will do his best to cheat and win , but also that he will follow step  [ nsteptwo ] properly ( rather than measuring in the computational basis ) because he will not want to relinquish his possibility to catch his mother cheating at verification step  [ nstepfive]or  so he thinks .",
    "hence , bob s cheating will consist in sending at step  [ nstepthree ] instead of choosing @xmath13 at random .",
    "after a calculation , we find that this gives him probability @xmath85 that , thus producing his winning outcome .",
    "unbeknownst to bob , however , his mother wants him to win , but she does not wish him to know this for fear of undermining her authority ! assuming she knows her son as well as she thinks , she proceeds as follows . at  step  [ nstepone ]",
    ", she honestly sends some random state  @xmath53 .",
    "when she receives bob s choice of @xmath13 at step  [ nstepthree ] , there are two possibilities . if  , she can relax and continue honestly since bob wins , according to her wish . on  the other hand ,",
    "if , then alice can deduce that bob used the wrong basis in his measurement : .",
    "this allows her to `` reveal '' @xmath8 together with any @xmath86 of her choice at step  [ nstepfour ] since she knows ( or  suspects ) that bob will be unable to call her a cheater .",
    "according to our story , she chooses to make bob happy .",
    "admittedly , the above tale is unlikely at best .",
    "nevertheless , it serves the purpose of demonstrating the importance in our proof of security against alice ( subsection  [ bobhonest ] ) that bob s bit @xmath13 be chosen randomly despite the fact that he has significant information about alice s @xmath9 after an honest measurement at step  [ nsteptwo ] . indeed , our proof relied in a crucial way on the fact that alice would have no information on the measurement basis used by bob .",
    "our  tale shows how wrong and damaging it would have been had the protocol asked an _",
    "honest _ bob to send a @xmath13 correlated to his measurement outcome .",
    "we have seen that bob could exploit the loss of quantum information to cheat in previous protocols , whereas our protocol is loss tolerant .",
    "nevertheless , our protocol could become susceptible to loss if it were implemented with insufficient care . a  _ side channel _",
    "is any source of information that bob could exploit about the quantum state sent by alice above and beyond its theoretical definition as a pure qubit .",
    "for  example , the protocol would be obviously insecure if the apparatus used by alice to generate her quantum states produced each of the four legitimate states as photons of significantly different wavelengths or spatial position .",
    "these issues have been extensively in the context of quantum key distribution .",
    "see  ref .",
    "@xcite for a compelling example of successful hacking of a commercially available apparatus .",
    "= -1    an interesting example of side channel would in a careless implementation of our quantum coin - flipping protocol if alice used an attenuated laser pulse to generate her states , as is done in most current implementations of quantum key distribution .",
    "the problem stems from the fact that one can distinguish conclusively between @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( eq .  [ rhonous ] ) when a pulse consists of two ( or more ) identical atvy states .",
    "for  this , it suffices for bob to measure one photon in basis @xmath56 and the other in basis  @xmath57 ( eq .  [ double - prime ] ) .",
    "if  the two measurements produce the same outcome , this is necessarily the correct bit  @xmath9 encoded by alice since one of the measurement has been performed in the correct basis .",
    "this occurs with probability . with the fair states ,",
    "bob s probability of conclusive outcome is therefore a substantial @xmath87 each time a pulse contains two photons , which means that this _ implementation _ of the protocol is completely insecure because bob can another state from alice until this event .    to make the case of attenuated laser pulses even worse , a perfectly natural measurement apparatus that an bob could use in the implementation of our protocol  @xcite would produce such conclusive outcome with half the probability derived above , namely @xmath88 of the double - photon pulses .",
    "it  follows that bob , who started the protocol with pure intentions , might find it difficult to resist sliding to the dark side when his ( )  measurement apparatus reveals with certainty the value of  @xmath9 chosen by  alice . a  practical solution to this problem is for alice to use a source of entangled photons , as discussed in ref .",
    "quantum coin flipping is a cryptographic primitive that has been studied extensively .",
    "several approaches have been considered since the very beginnings of quantum cryptography . however , previous protocols are either totally insecure  @xcite , or they are highly sensitive to ( if  not completely broken  by ) technologically unavoidably losses of quantum information on the channel between the players or in their storage and detection apparatus  @xcite . in  this paper",
    ", we introduced the first loss - tolerant quantum coin - flipping protocol , which means that it is completely impervious to such losses .",

    "indeed and massar have argued that single - shot quantum coin - flipping protocols are problematic when both noise and loss can  @xcite .",
    "if secure single - shot quantum coin - flipping protocols are indeed impossible in the presence of noise , is there something useful that quantum coin flipping can do above and beyond anything classically possible ?",
    "we  already know that random bit - string generation  @xcite is not the answer given that it can be done classically  @xcite .",
    "we  are currently investigating this issue  @xcite along a different line from that proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another open question concerns the optimality of our protocol .",
    "could there be a loss - tolerant quantum coin - flipping protocol whose bias is smaller than  @xmath5 ?",
    "alternatively , can we prove that @xmath5 is the smallest bias possible among all loss - tolerant quantum coin - flipping protocols ?",
