    "the use of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath7pt ) to describe few - nucleon systems is a problem that has received much attention over the past twenty years .",
    "this effort began with the seminal papers of weinberg  @xcite , and has recently been reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this approach",
    "the nn potential is computed up to some fixed order , @xmath8 , in the chiral expansion in powers of @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the nn c.m .",
    "momentum , @xmath11 the pion mass , and the breakdown scale @xmath12 is nominally @xmath13 , but in reality is somewhat lower for reactions involving baryons .",
    "this nn potential is then iterated , using the schrdinger or lippmann - schwinger equation , to obtain the scattering amplitude .",
    "this approach has come to be known as chiral effective field theory ( @xmath7eft ) as it encodes the consequences of qcd s pattern of chiral - symmetry breaking for few - nucleon systems and is built on a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath14 , while resumming the non - perturbative effects that lead to the existence of nuclear bound states .",
    "electromagnetic reactions provide particularly fertile ground for the application of @xmath7eft .",
    "a few - nucleon electromagnetic current operator , @xmath15 , can also be derived from @xmath7pt  ko09,ko11,pa08,pa09,pa11,pi12 , and matrix elements are then constructed via : @xmath16where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are solutions of the schrdinger equation for the @xmath7eft potential @xmath19in principle at order @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath7pt predicts that short - distance effects will enter @xmath20 eventually , but minimal substitution generates the first several orders in the expansion for @xmath15 , especially in the case of the charge operator .",
    "this enables predictions for charge form factors of @xmath21  pc99,wm01,ph03,ph07,pi12 and @xmath22  @xcite systems to be obtained as pure predictions up to order @xmath23 relative to leading order .",
    "these predictions agree well with data up to at least @xmath24 gev@xmath25 . in the magnetic response",
    "the first short - distance operator not determined by nn scattering or single - nucleon properties enters considerably earlier , but accurate predictions for form factors can still be made  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the existence of this additional short - distance operator allows enhanced understanding of magnetic moments and m1 transitions in systems up to @xmath26 , with reactions that had not previously been understood now being explained , and correlated , through the presence of the same short - distance @xmath27nn@xmath28nn operator  @xcite .    in this work we focus on the application of this formalism to electrodisintegration of deuterium , and specifically the computation of the longitudinal response function , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath29 is proportional to the square of the matrix element of the nn charge operator between the deuteron wave function and the wave function of a continuum nn state .",
    "@xmath30 is given solely by a single - nucleon operator up to @xmath31 relative to leading order in the @xmath7eft expansion , so calculations of @xmath29 can take the information gleaned on nn interactions from scattering experiments and use it to make quite accurate predictions for an electromagnetic observable .",
    "deuteron electro - disintegration has been employed as a testing ground for nn models for a long time  aren , aren1,aren2,alt00,alt02,alt05 .",
    "since the 4-momentum in the breakup process is given by a virtual photon , a richer set of kinematics can be probed as compared to the photo - disintegration process . and , in addition to the deuteron wave function , the disintegration process probes both the on - shell and off - shell nn t - matrix through the final - state interaction .",
    "this means that the solutions for the deuteron wave function @xmath32 , and the nn t - matrix , are input to our calculation . to obtain them from @xmath0eft potentials we need to impose a cutoff on the intermediate states , @xmath33 .",
    "the low - energy constants ( lecs ) multiplying contact interactions in the nucleon - nucleon part of the chiral lagrangian should then be adjusted to eliminate any cutoff dependence @xmath34 or greater in the effective theory s predictions for low - energy observables .",
    "if this is not possible we conclude that @xmath0eft is unable to give reliable predictions . at leading order",
    "the @xmath0eft potential consists of a zero - derivative contact interaction that is operative only in nn partial waves with @xmath35 together with one - pion exchange , which is active in all partial waves . in an earlier work",
    "we showed how to  subtractively renormalize \" the lo equations for nn scattering in these two channels  @xcite .",
    "this technique eliminates the contact interaction in favor of a low - energy observable ( e.g. the relevant nn scattering length ) .",
    "this makes it straightforward to take the limit @xmath36 : no fine - tuning of the pertinent lec is necessary . the resulting phase shifts ( and one mixing parameter ) do not provide anything like a precision description of nn data , but they are , at least , a well - defined , renormalized lo calculation .",
    "however , several papers have demonstrated that a lo @xmath0eft calculation does not produce reliable predictions in partial waves with @xmath37 once @xmath33 is sufficiently large  @xcite .",
    "this is because only one - pion exchange is present in these waves at lo , and the resulting singular potential has no nn lec that permits renormalization .",
    "we examined this problem within the context of subtractive renormalization and confirmed the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. any partial wave with @xmath37 where one - pion exchange is attractive does not have stable lo results in @xmath0et  @xcite .",
    "we also showed that this problem is not removed at @xmath38 or @xmath39 . in particular , at @xmath40 two - pion exchange produces a highly singular , attractive potential .",
    "the nn contact interactions needed to renormalize this potential are not present , e.g. in the @xmath41p@xmath42-@xmath41f@xmath42 channel .",
    "the resulting lack of stability with @xmath33 of the nn phase shifts occurs once @xmath33 is larger than @xmath43 gev . in ref",
    ".  @xcite we used subtractive renormalization to calculate s - wave nn phase shifts from @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath0et potentials . here",
    "too we found that the phase shifts are not stable once @xmath44 gev . in this case",
    "part of the problem is that the momentum - dependent contact interaction that appears at @xmath38 has limited effect as @xmath36  wigner , pc96,sc96 .",
    "thus the nn potential obtained by straightforward application of @xmath0pt can not be used over a wide range of cutoffs : @xmath0eft as formulated above is not properly renormalized , i.e. the impact of short - distance physics on the results is not under control .    nevertheless , in refs .",
    "@xcite ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath19 was computed to @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath3 ) , and the several nn lecs which appear in @xmath19 were fitted to nn data for a range of cutoffs between 500 and 800 mev .",
    "the @xmath3 predictions contain very little residual cutoff dependence in this range of @xmath33 s , and describe nn data with considerable accuracy .",
    "this suggests that @xmath0eft may be a systematic theory of few - nucleon systems if we employ @xmath33 s in the vicinity of @xmath45 .",
    "since the short - distance physics of the effective theory for @xmath46 is different to the short - distance physics of qcd itself , some authors argue that considering @xmath47 does not yield any extra information about the real impact of short - distance physics on observables  @xcite .",
    "using low cutoffs has the advantage that relevant momenta are demonstrably within the domain of validity of @xmath0pt .",
    "discussion about whether such a procedure results in the omission of some operators is ongoing  @xcite . in what follows",
    "we employ wave functions obtained with the standard @xmath0eft counting and our subtractive renormalization method  @xcite , but we do so only for cutoffs @xmath33 up to the maximum value where we found reasonable results in refs .",

    "our deuteron electrodisintegration calculation provides an opportunity to test this strategy , by comparing its predictions for deuteron structure and final - state interactions to experimental data",
    ". however , experimental data on @xmath29 are somewhat limited  especially in the low - energy and low-@xmath49 region of most interest to @xmath7eft .",
    "much of the data on @xmath29 that do exist have been averaged over spectrometer acceptances , which makes comparison with theory not only complicated , but also , in some cases , ambiguous . therefore , although we do compare with data from refs .",
    "vds91,du94,jo96 , we use the bonn - potential calculations of arenhvel _ et al .",
    "_ as a proxy for data .",
    "these calculations have been quite successful in describing data : non - l / t separated  @xcite , l / t - separated  @xcite , and even on the interference response functions , @xmath50 and @xmath51  @xcite , taken at many different laboratories over a wide range of relevant kinematic conditions .",

    "a necessary condition for the @xmath0eft predictions to be considered reliable is that they show minimal dependence on the cutoff @xmath33 .",

    "_ using a similar strategy and the wave functions of refs",
