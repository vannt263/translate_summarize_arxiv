    "@xcite a mechanical effect is proposed for explanation of the observed motion of particles towards each other , when they move away a single wall due to the coulomb repulsion @xcite .",
    "this mechanical effect is irrelevant in analysis of interaction of free particles in a fluid or ones confined between walls or on interfaces ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as one can conclude , no one above mechanism is responsible for the set of observations of long distance attraction of colloidal particles ( may be excepting the mechanical effect @xcite , which can be relevant for the particle motion in the one wall geometry @xcite ) . an important hint in search and selection of possible mechanisms of attraction is the universality of a depth of the attraction minimum @xmath13 . a most probable mechanism ,",
    "satisfying this criterion , is an interaction , mediated by thermal fluctuations of some physical values .",
    "this is a microscopic type of interaction , which can be formulated in terms of a potential energy .",
    "regardless of specificity of fluctuating matter , the free energy of thermal fluctuations is always proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "for example , the attraction potential of two dielectric particles ( refractive index @xmath22 ) in the water ( refractive index @xmath23 ) due to thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field is proportional to @xmath24 . if @xmath22 is close to @xmath23 , then @xmath25 , according to the perturbation theory . with real values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for polystyrene and water",
    "the coefficient @xmath26 is very small , what makes the conventional van der waals attraction in the micron range to be negligible .",
    "nevertheless , if to put formally @xmath27 ( zero fields gradient on the particles surface ) , the attraction in the micron range is not small comparing to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this is similar to the situation in hydrodynamics , where fluctuating electromagnetic waves are substituted by hydrodynamic ones and the fluid velocity is zero on the particles surface .",
    "hence , one can expect the interaction , mediated by fluctuating hydrodynamic waves , to be not small like in the electromagnetic case with @xmath27 .",
    "the nature of forces , mediated by fluctuations of sound waves in a fluid , can be clarified in the following way : the energy of thermal fluctuations of the fluid depends on a distance between two particles , which play a role of obstacles for a fluid motion , and hence this results in a force .",
    "the non - electromagnetic type of fluctuation forces , discussed by dzyaloshinskii , lifshitz , and pitaevskii @xcite , can be considered as some sort of the van der waals @xcite or the casimir @xcite forces .",
    "we do not concern here the story of origin of the two titles for fluctuation interactions .",
    "in addition to the attraction , mediated by fluid fluctuations , there is another mechanism of a fluctuation interaction related to hydrodynamics : this is an interaction , mediated by thermal fluctuations of particle positions in a fluid .",
    "the effective particle masses depend on a fluid mass , involved into the motion .",
    "the fluid mass depends on an inter - particle distance and therefore the effective particle masses also depend on that distance .",
    "if a mass of a classic non - dissipative harmonic oscillator depends on the coordinate , the mean coordinate shifts to the region with a bigger mass ( smaller velocity ) , since the particle spends there more time .",
    "analogously , for a brownian motion of particles in a fluid a thermal drift occurs in the direction of a bigger effective mass .",
    "as shown in the paper , the effective particle mass , which determines the effect , should be calculated on base of the euler ( non - dissipative ) hydrodynamics and it can be called the euler mass .",
    "the above fluctuation interactions relate to hard spheres ( no mean - field interaction excepting an infinite repulsion on contact ) .",
    "if particles are charged , the fluctuation hydrodynamic forces are weakly modified by the coulomb effects in a bulk fluid under typical experimental conditions .",
    "the only interaction , mediated by fluctuations of particle positions , can be influenced by an electrostatic restriction of particle fluctuation motions in the direction perpendicular to charged confining plates .",
    "the total interaction is a sum of the fluctuation ones and the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the following results are presented in the paper : ( i ) the attraction forces between two parallel plates and spherical particles with short inter - surface distance , mediated by hydrodynamic fluctuations of sound waves , are shown to exist and they are calculated analytically ; ( ii ) a novel interaction of particles in a fluid is proposed , which is based on dependence of their effective masses on a distance between them ; ( iii ) the fokker - planck equation for two particles in a fluid is derived ; ( iv ) a difference in measurements of a particle interaction by optical tweezers and by a long time statistics is pointed out and calculated .",
    "suppose two particles are placed inside a hydrodynamic medium , they are totally fixed in space , and serves only as obstacles for a fluid motion .",
    "there is no macroscopic motion in the system and the only motion is caused by thermal fluctuations of the fluid velocity @xmath28 . in this case",
    "the free energy of thermal fluctuations of the fluid @xmath29 depends on the distance @xmath15 between bodies .",
    "the function @xmath30 is an interaction mediated by fluid fluctuations .",
    "analogously to the conventional van der waals interaction mediated by electromagnetic fluctuations , the potential ( [ 1 ] ) can be called _ the hydrodynamic van der waals interaction_. to find the free energy of thermal fluctuations of the fluid one can start with the linearized navier - stokes equation @xcite @xmath31 there are two types of fluid motion , one of them is a transverse diffusion and the second one is longitudinal sound waves , associated with the density variation .",
    "the equilibrium free energy of transverse motions is determined by the boltzmann distribution of their kinetic energies and does not depend on the friction coefficient in the thermal limit .",
    "since there is no static interaction for transverse motions , their equilibrium free energy in the thermal limit depends on the total volume , but not on relative positions of bodies . therefore , transverse fluctuations do not result in an interaction .",
    "quite opposite situation occurs for longitudinal motions , when the total free energy is a sum of energies of different sound modes .",
    "the spectrum of sound waves depends on the distance between bodies @xmath15 due to hydrodynamic boundary conditions on body surfaces and this results in @xmath15-dependence of the free energy .",
    "hence , the fluctuation interaction between bodies is mediated by hydrodynamic sound waves like the conventional van der waals interaction is mediated by fluctuations of electromagnetic ones .",
    "putting @xmath32 , one can obtain from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) @xmath33 through thermodynamic relations and the continuity equation one can obtain @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the adiabatic sound velocity @xcite . at the typical frequency @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the particle radius ) , involved into the problem , the dissipative term in eq .",

    "the inter - surface distance , measured in the direction parallel to the center - to - center line , is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the coordinates in the plane perpendicular to the center - to - center line .",

    "sound velocities for polystyrene particles @xmath61 and for water @xmath62 provide a finite mismatch , which reduces the result ( [ e10 ] ) , as one can show , approximately four times .",
    "but in reality this conclusion is not correct , since transverse acoustic modes of the particle material increase the mismatch turning the interaction towards the result ( [ e10 ] ) .",
    "an account of the finite mismatch is a matter of further study , but the exact @xmath59 seems to be close to the result ( [ e10 ] ) .",

    "in case of the conventional van der waals interaction , mediated by electromagnetic fluctuations , the mean values of electric and magnetic fields are zero @xmath74 .",

    "the interaction @xmath188 is also of a fluctuation origin .",
    "it has a simple mechanical explanation based on that a particle spends more time at a region with a bigger mass , since there its velocity is smaller .",

    "the interaction @xmath188 is not modified by the coulomb effects in a bulk fluid , but can be influenced by an electrostatic restriction of fluctuations in the direction perpendicular to charged confining plates .",
    "the total interaction energy of two particles in a fluid is a sum of the coulomb repulsive part ( dlvo ) @xcite and the attractive potentials @xmath59 and @xmath188 , plotted in fig .",
    "a character of the resulting interaction depends on particle charges and the debye length in a very delicate way .",

    "nevertheless , when @xmath1 is not sufficiently small , the resulting potential minimum is far and can be indistinguishable in experiments . refs .",
    "@xcite reported an absence of attraction .",
    "a lucky choice of electrostatic parameters to observe fluctuation hydrodynamic forces corresponds to a close position of the minimum @xmath189 .",
    "the hydrodynamic fluctuation interactions is unavoidable and therefore non - interacting spheres , strongly speaking , can not exist in a fluid .",
    "the term `` hard spheres '' means an absence of a mean - field ( non - fluctuation ) interaction excepting an infinite repulsion on contact .",
    "an interaction between two hard spheres in a dense system of them @xcite , remaining of the order of @xmath11 , is expected to differ from interaction between two isolated ones , considered here , since the hydrodynamic fluctuation forces , due to their non - perturbative nature , can not be reduced to a pairwise interaction .",
    "the experimentally observed attraction satisfies the @xmath0-universality condition , i.e. , it is of the order of @xmath0 in various experiments .",
    "this universality is not a trivial property , since electrostatic and hydrodynamic mean - field energies are of a few orders of magnitude bigger comparing to the room temperature .",
    "the @xmath11-universality enables a strong selection of possible attraction mechanisms .",
    "perhaps , a unique candidacy , satisfying this universality , is an attraction , mediated by thermal fluctuations of some physical quantities .",
    "since the both mechanism proposed above lead to attraction of the order of @xmath0 , they are likely relevant in interpretation of experimental data on attraction . the next step is to study @xmath59 and @xmath188 at all @xmath15 for spherical particles in a bulk fluid and for a confined geometry .",
