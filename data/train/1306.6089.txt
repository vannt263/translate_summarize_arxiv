    "further , the large hadron collider has placed stringent constraints on scenarios such as supersymmetry that have provided the theoretical basis for wimp dark matter @xcite . indeed , these constraints are most easily alleviated by allowing for a rapid decay of the supersymmetric wimp candidate ( e.g.  @xcite ) , precluding a cosmological role for it .",
    "thus , it is essential to develop techniques to search for a wide class of dark matter candidates",
    ".    introduced as a solution to the strong cp problem @xcite , the axion is a prominent dark matter candidate .",

    "an initial displacement of the axion field from its minimum results in oscillations of this field with frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the energy density in these oscillations can be dark matter @xcite .",
    "other types of light bosons , often called axion - like - particles ( alps ) , have attracted significant attention  @xcite .",
    "these receive a potential ( and a mass ) from non - qcd sources and are less constrained than the qcd axion . like the oscillations of the qcd axion , oscillations of the alp field in its potential can also be dark matter .",
    "we focus on light alps with masses @xmath7 comparable to that of the axion .",
    "we will use the term alp to refer to any of these light bosons , including the qcd axion .",
    "the temporal coherence of the oscillations of the dark matter alp field in an experiment is limited by motion through the spatial gradients of the field .",
    "the size of these gradients is set by the de - broglie wavelength , giving rise to a coherence time @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the galactic virial velocity of the alp dark matter @xcite .",
    "the axion s properties are determined by @xmath3 .",
    "astrophysical bounds rule out axions with @xmath10 gev @xcite . while @xmath11 gev used to be claimed to be ruled out by cosmological arguments , this",

    "the conversion of axions into photons in the presence of a magnetic field can be used to search for axions with @xmath12 gev @xcite , but the ability of such techniques to probe axions with @xmath13 gev is limited .",
    "it is important to develop techniques that can search for axions over the vast majority of parameter space up to @xmath14 gev , especially because of the generic theoretical expectation that the symmetry breaking scale @xmath3 should be close to other fundamental scales in particle physics such as the grand unified ( @xmath15 gev ) and planck ( @xmath16 gev ) scales @xcite .",
    "the axion field induces a time varying nucleon electric dipole moment ( edm ) @xmath17 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath18 is the local amplitude of the axion dark matter field .",
    "see @xcite for detailed formulas and derivations of these results .",
    "this edm is generated from the defining coupling @xmath19 of the axion to qcd @xcite , caused by the same qcd dynamics that leads to physical effects for the operator @xmath20 ( _ e.g. _ nucleon edms @xmath21 ) @xcite , resulting in the strong cp problem and its resolution , the axion .",
    "essentially , the dark matter axion can be thought of as an oscillating value of @xmath22 .",
    "all edm experiments to date have searched for static edms and have greatly reduced sensitivity to the oscillating nuclear edm induced by an axion .",
    "but in fact , the oscillation of the edm should , in many ways , make searches easier . even though the axion is generated by physics at high energies ( @xmath23 gev ) , its ultra - light mass lies at frequencies accessible in the laboratory .",
    "a signal that naturally oscillates at a frequency set by fundamental physics , independent of the details of any particular experiment , should ameliorate many of the systematic errors that often limit the sensitivity of edm searches .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that axion dark matter could be detected in future molecular interferometers using this oscillating edm .",
    "here we argue that such an oscillating edm can be observed through solid - state nmr - based experiments using presently available technology .",
    "we further exploit the oscillatory nature of the signal by designing a resonant detector that enhances the signal , potentially allowing detection of the qcd axion .",
    "the nucleon edm naturally induced by an axion is the primary focus of this paper .",
    "however , such interactions may also exist for alps and our techniques will also search for them @xcite .",
    " solid - state edm \" experiments @xcite have been proposed as promising ways to search for static edms of electrons and nucleons , and an experimental limit on the electron edm has been set using these methods @xcite .",
    "this result was not competitive with the current best limit on the electron edm , due to the systematic effect of sample heating caused by electric field reversal in a dissipative ferroelectric material .",
    "we propose an experiment that uses the solid - state approach , together with magnetic - resonance techniques , to search for axion or alp dark matter . crucially , since the nucleon edm is intrinsically time varying , unlike in static edm searches , it can be detected without electric field reversals .",

    "this transverse magnetization can be measured with a magnetometer such as a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) with a pickup loop oriented as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . for",
    "a static edm the transverse magnetization will not build up in time since its direction relative to the electric field continually oscillates .",
    "likewise , when the alp - induced edm oscillation frequency is different from the larmor frequency , no measurable transverse magnetization ensues .",
    "however , when the two frequencies coincide , there occurs a resonance akin to that in the usual nmr .",
    "the magnitude of the external magnetic field ( @xmath26 ) is swept to search for this resonance . at time",
    "@xmath27 the spins are prepared along @xmath24 , at subsequent times the magnitude of the transverse magnetization is given by @xmath28}{\\frac{2 \\mu { b_\\text{ext}}- m_a c^2}{\\hbar } }   \\sin \\left (   2 \\mu { b_\\text{ext}}t \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the number density of nuclear spins , @xmath30 is the polarization , @xmath31 is the nuclear magnetic dipole moment , and we assume a spin-1/2 nucleus .",
    "technically , by schiff s theorem , there can be no net electric field at the nucleus , so the effect of the edm is actually zero .",
    "instead the signal actually arises from the schiff moment . following standard convention , we parametrize this effect as @xmath32 , the schiff suppression factor @xcite , times @xmath33 , the magnitude of the alp - induced nuclear edm .",
    "thus @xmath34 acts as the effective edm of the nucleus in the material and @xmath35 is the energy shift produced between spin - up and spin - down states of the nucleus .",
    "the resonant enhancement occurs when @xmath36 .",
    "geometry of the experiment .",
    "the applied magnetic field @xmath37 is colinear with the sample magnetization , @xmath38 .",
    "the effective electric field in the crystal @xmath25 is perpendicular to @xmath24 .",
    "the squid pickup loop is arranged to measure the transverse magnetization of the sample.,width=3 ]    the nuclear magnetic moments in the sample are polarized using a large applied magnetic field ( @xmath39  t ) at low temperature ( @xmath40  k ) , achieving a polarization fraction @xmath41 .",

    "the polarization persists for time , @xmath42 , set by the spin - lattice relaxation . at cryogenic temperature , @xmath42 can reach many hours or longer  @xcite .",
    "it is advantageous to use an element whose nuclear spin is 1/2 , which usually leads to longer spin - lattice relaxation times .    on resonance , the net transverse magnetization precesses at the larmor frequency ( @xmath43 ) , as in eq .  .",
    "the amplitude of the resonant transverse magnetization increases linearly with time , in principle up to the alp coherence time @xmath44 . in practice",
    "this increase may be cutoff earlier if other effects broaden the resonance .",
    "for example , the transverse relaxation time of the nuclear spins , @xmath45 , may be shorter than @xmath44 . in this case , @xmath45 would set the maximum resonant enhancement achievable , so that the factor @xmath46}{2 \\mu { b_\\text{ext}}- m_a c^2}$ ] from eq .   would have a maximum @xmath47 ( in polycrystalline samples at high magnetic fields , the chemical shift anisotropy",
    "may broaden the resonance even further ) .",
    "the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between nuclear spins sets @xmath48 ms , however dynamic - decoupling schemes have been shown to suppress broadening due to chemical shifts and increase @xmath45 substantially @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 in excess of 10 s or even 1000 s has been achieved in other materials , for example @xcite .",
    "a material with a crystal structure with broken inversion symmetry at the site of the high-_z _ atoms is necessary for generation of a large effective electric field @xmath49 , which is proportional to the displacement of the heavy atom from the centro - symmetric position in the unit cell  @xcite . in a ferroelectric",
    ", this displacement can be switched by an applied voltage , however , given the oscillating nature of the alp - induced signal , it may not be necessary to modulate this displacement , in which case any polar crystal can be used . for ferroelectric pbtio@xmath50 , the effective electric field",
    "is @xmath51  v / cm @xcite . for other materials , where polarization is permanent",
    ", this may be higher by a factor of a few .",
    "a detailed discussion of the requirements for the sample material is in the supplemental materials .",
    "the measurement procedure is as follows .",
    "the sample is repolarized after every time interval @xmath42 .",
    "then the applied magnetic field is set to a fixed value , which must be controlled to a precision equal to the fractional width of the resonance .",
    "the magnetic field value determines the alp frequency to which the experiment is sensitive .",
    "the transverse magnetization is measured as a function of time with fixed applied magnetic field .",
    "we call a measurement at a given value of magnetic field `` a shot . '' the total integration time at any one magnetic field value , @xmath52 , is set by the requirement that an @xmath53 range of frequencies is scanned in 3 years . if @xmath45 is longer than the alp coherence time @xmath44 , then when searching at frequency @xmath6 the width of the frequency band is @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath45 is shorter than @xmath44 then the width of the frequency band is @xmath55 .",

    "the signal of an alp would be excess power in a range of magnetic fields ( alp frequencies ) .",
    "if multiple alps existed they would appear as multiple spikes at different frequencies .",
    "note that at the lowest frequencies @xmath58 the resonance is broadened significantly so that an @xmath59 range of frequencies is covered in any given frequency bin . in this regime",
    "one may use any of the established techniques searching for static nuclear edms but with short sampling times @xmath60 , then look for an oscillating signal in the data .",
    "this search for a time varying edm is substantially different from searches for a static edm using solid state systems . in searching for a static edm ,",
    "it is necessary to separate the energy shift induced by the edm from other systematic effects .",
    "this is accomplished by searching for energy shifts that modulate linearly with the applied electric field in the sample",
    ". however , the modulation of the electric field can induce additional systematic shifts in the system that occur at that modulation frequency , competing with the static edm signal @xcite .",
    "this is not the case for a time varying edm .",
    "the alp induced edm oscillates at a frequency set by fundamental physics and leads to observable effects in a system whose parameters are static .",
    "the time variation provides the handle necessary to separate this signal from other systematic energy shifts and the signal can be detected without the need for additional handles such as electric field reversals .",
    "this eliminates the systematic problems encountered by solid state static edm searches such as the dissipation effects in the solid material associated with electric field reversals @xcite .",
    "the experimental sensitivity is likely to be limited by the magnetometer , rather than by the backgrounds discussed below .",
    "we assume a squid magnetometer with sensitivity @xmath61 as calculated from @xcite for a @xmath62 cm diameter sample and pickup loop ( see supplemental materials ) .",

    "phase 2 ( lower , red region ) relies on technological improvements which have been demonstrated individually but have not been combined in a single experiment .",

    "significant technological challenges have to be overcome before this experiment reaches the ultimate sensitivity goals of phase 2 .",
    "the technological challenges of phase 1 are relatively easier to overcome and it can immediately begin cutting into alp dark matter in the allowed region of parameter space in fig . [",
    "fig : edm ] @xcite .",
    "in fact , modifications of current edm techniques that are optimized to search for a time varying signal can also begin constraining this parameter space .",
    "transverse , time - varying magnetic fields that vary at frequencies in the measurement bandwidth are a source of noise .",
    "the fundamental source of noise is due to the quantum projection of each spin along the transverse directions causing a transverse magnetization of the sample @xcite .",
    "this noise can be decreased by using larger sample volumes .",
    "note that the sensitivity limit set by this fundamental magnetization noise ( red dashed line ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : edm ] would allow detection of the qcd axion over the entire frequency range accessible in this experiment .    a more detailed discussion of this projection noise , as well as other , technical , sources of experimental noise , such as vibrations ,",
    "is included in the appendix .",
    "choosing an optimal experimental strategy requires engineering studies that are left for future work .",
    "the static edm searches require control over the dc components of these magnetic fields , while our experiment requires control over the ac component at relatively high frequencies @xmath72 khz .",
    "such control should be easier to achieve and it thus seems plausible that these sources of noise can be adequately suppressed .",
    "for example , control over ac magnetic - field noise at comparable levels in the background of a large external field has been demonstrated in current cavity searches for the axion @xcite .",
    "the proposed experiment appears to have sufficient sensitivity to detect axion dark matter , especially when @xmath3 is in the theoretically favored range between the grand unified and planck scales .",
    "it is also sensitive to alps that couple to the nucleon edm , probing sources of symmetry breaking in the alp sector .",
    "the signal in this solid - state nmr - based experiment benefits from the large number ( @xmath73 ) of spins in a solid state system . in conjunction with precision magnetometers ,",
    "this approach enables sensitivity to this region of parameter space using current technology .",
    "in fact , with some improvements in magnetometer sensitivity , this technique could be used to detect the qcd axion with @xmath3 essentially all the way down to the region that can be probed by microwave cavity experiments such as admx .",
    "together then , these techniques may cover almost the entire qcd axion dark matter range .",
    "we do not know of any other approach that can be sensitive to this region of parameter space using present technology .",
    "previous proposals that were aimed at searching for the time varying edm induced by alp dark matter were focussed on detecting them through interferometry in ultra - cold molecular systems .",
    "these proposals require significant technology development to reach the sensitivity necessary to detect qcd axion dark matter , primarily because they are limited by the substantially smaller effective number of such cold molecules ( @xmath74 ) that can be produced with current technology .",
    "in contrast to searches for the dark - matter axion through its coupling to photons , the sensitivity in the present approach has only a weak dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "this is because the measured spin precession probes the matrix element ( @xmath75 ) of the axion interaction .",
    "the edm arises from a non - derivative interaction of the axion and its physical effects are not suppressed by the ratio of the size of the experiment and the axion wavelength .",
    "indeed , the axion dark matter induced edm has a fixed magnitude independent of @xmath3 .",
    "since the axion coherence time grows with @xmath3 , @xmath76 , the sensitivity of this experiment also grows with @xmath3 .",
    "by contrast experiments relying on the axion - photon coupling @xmath77 are suppressed by the large axion wavelength at high @xmath3 , because @xmath78 is a total derivative so all physical effects must be proportional to derivatives of the axion field .",
    "the time varying nature of the axion ( or alp ) induced edm is a key feature of this concept .",
    "the edm oscillates at a frequency set by particle physics , independent of the experimental setup .",
    "this distinguishes the signal from many possible backgrounds and should ameliorate the challenges faced by static edm searches .",
    "for example , electric field reversals are not needed to see this signal , eliminating the dissipative sample - heating systematics that limited the solid - state static edm searches .",
    "further , control over noise sources is only required over the signal s relatively high frequency range ( khz - mhz ) and narrow bandwidth ( @xmath79 ) . finally , though the induced edm is small , its oscillation at laboratory frequencies enables resonant schemes that improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "a positive signal can be verified in many ways .",
    "the signal should change with the relative orientation of the nuclear spin and the electric field ; it should be in phase with that from another sample that is placed within the alp de broglie wavelength ( @xmath80 300 km ) .",
    "if there is evidence of a signal at any particular frequency , the apparatus can be tuned to that frequency to determine if the signal builds up in that band as expected .",
    "similarly to the state of wimp direct detection at its beginning , there are serious technical challenges that must be overcome for our proposed axion direct - detection technique to reach its ultimate sensitivity .",
    "for example , while there are materials ( such as pbtio@xmath50 , and solid solutions pb(zr , ti)o@xmath50 , ( pb , la)(zr , ti)o@xmath50 ) that have the properties necessary to begin implementing this proposal , further work is necessary to find an optimal choice .",
    "but , the case for axion ( and alp ) dark matter is strong enough to merit the necessary effort .",
    "in fact , well before reaching the ultimate sensitivity necessary to see qcd axion dark matter , current edm techniques can be optimized to search for a time varying edm that can already search for alp dark matter in the allowed region of parameter space in fig .",
    "[ fig : edm ] @xcite . with our resonant scheme ,",
    "the ultimate sensitivity of this proposal allows for the detection of qcd axion dark matter . as with wimp detectors , this is a scalable experiment with several possible avenues for improvements in sensitivity . reaching the qcd axion requires overcoming significant technological challenges . but long before that level of sensitivity is reached , this experiment will probe large regions of alp parameter space beyond current astrophysical and laboratory limits .",
    "a discovery in such an experiment would have profound consequences for physics since it would reveal not just the nature of dark matter and establish the axion as the solution to the strong cp problem , but also provide a window into some of the highest energy scales in nature .",

    "we do not propose a particular material here .",
    "instead we discuss the factors which are involved in this decision and illustrate with examples .",
    "the material should be chosen to optimize @xmath81 , @xmath30 , the transverse relaxation time @xmath45 , and @xmath49 . similarly to the situation in wimp direct detection , many different detector materials may be worth exploring on the path toward detection of axion dark matter .",
    "the sample should be an insulating material containing no unpaired electron spins .",
    "the signal is due to the alp - induced nuclear schiff moment which scales with @xmath82 ( @xmath83 is atomic number ) @xcite .",
    "so the material should have large - z atoms whose nuclei have a non - zero magnetic dipole moment , such as @xmath84pb that has nuclear spin 1/2 .",
    "heavy elements , e.g.  pb or hg have schiff suppression factors @xmath85 .",
    "elements exist with even higher schiff moments @xmath86 , for example the light actinides @xcite , but these are challenging to work with because they are radioactive .",
    "an important source of time varying magnetic fields is @xmath87 , the magnetic field that is applied to the sample to tune its larmor frequency close to the alp s mass .",
    "transverse fluctuations of this field are a source of noise .",
    "there are several strategies that can address them .",
    "first , field fluctuations caused by the relative mechanical motion of the sample in relation to @xmath87 can be minimized by rigidly attaching the sample to the source of the magnetic field .",
    "it may also be possible to engineer vibration - isolation systems to damp such sources of noise at the frequencies of interest to this experiment ( @xmath88 khz ) .",
    "second , superconducting magnets can be used to provide @xmath87 , significantly suppressing ac field noise from @xmath87 .",
    "third , the phase of the signal depends upon the relative orientation between the nuclear spin ( the direction of the edm ) and the internal electric field in the crystal .",
    "a differential measurement between two samples where these orientations are different will retain the alp signal while canceling common - mode magnetic - field noise . with this strategy ,",
    "it is only the gradients of @xmath87 that contribute to the differential signal .",
    "these gradients can be minimized through the use of well known coil arrangements such as maxwell coils . it should be noted that in such coil arrangements , the transverse component of the applied field is also similarly suppressed .",
    "consequently , with this differential - measurement strategy , this noise is suppressed by three potentially small parameters : the initial size of the time variation , the longitudinal gradient , and the size of the transverse component of the applied field .",
    "certain noise issues can also be addressed by measurements of the malefactor .",
    "for example , the longitudinal magnetic field can be measured and used to correct transverse fluctuations if such fluctuations are caused by instabilities in the currents used to provide @xmath87 .",
    "similarly , measurements of mechanical motions between the sample and the source of @xmath87 can be used to remove the effect of these motions on the magnetic field .",
    "time varying external magnetic fields are also a source of noise and the sample must be screened from them .",
    "this can be done using superconducting shields which have been demonstrated to reduce ac field noise by over @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic magnetization noise of the sample is due to the random flips of the nuclear spins . a model for this spin noise",
    "was presented in @xcite , and its power spectrum @xmath90 was found to be @xmath91 the spin noise is peaked around the larmor frequency @xmath92 and has a bandwidth @xmath93 .",
    "this spectrum was used to estimate the magnetization noise as in fig 2 .",
    "the model of @xcite is an approximation to the noise in a real material .",
    "but , the parametric features of this model such as the noise peak at the larmor frequency with a bandwidth set by @xmath45 and its dependence on sample volume are expected to be realized in a real material @xcite .",
    "this model of the intrinsic sample - magnetization noise is consistent with the expectations of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and it has been experimentally confirmed in systems in equilibrium @xcite . since the experimental frequency and bandwidth are always much greater than @xmath94 , the magnetization noise at these frequencies is dominated by the spin - spin magnetic dipole @xmath45-relaxation processes .",
    "these local processes are unaffected by the polarization of the sample and hence this is a good estimate of the magnetization noise .",
    "we integrate this noise over the frequency bandwidth being measured ( around any particular axion mass ) : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the offset of the center of the axion signal from the larmor frequency , and @xmath97 is defined to be the  signal bandwidth time \" so that @xmath98 is the bandwidth of the signal region being searched in .",
    "@xmath97 is taken to be the smaller of the axion coherence time @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the measurement because whichever of these times is smaller defines the bandwidth in which we are looking for the signal .",
    "note that @xmath45 can not be longer than the integration time at a particular frequency , though this requirement is not relevant given that the longest @xmath45 we have chosen to plot in fig .",

    "so the noise improves linearly in time up to the smaller of @xmath45 and @xmath44 , then like the square root up to @xmath44 ( if @xmath102 ) , then like the fourth root up to the full integration time at this axion mass .",

    "we are still allowed to take such a large @xmath45 even though it is longer than the time of an individual measurement @xmath44 so long as it is shorter than the full integration time at this particular axion mass .",
    "this is because physically one may keep running the experiment and measuring the transverse magnetization of the sample without repolarizing it up to a time @xmath42 .",
    "this helps keep the magnetization noise curve lower at the higher axion masses .",
    "this is not necessary for the experiment described here because even if we limited @xmath45 to be no longer than @xmath44 the magnetization noise curve would still be below the magnetometer noise curve in fig",

    "the transverse magnetization produced by the sample can be measured with a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer .",
    "the magnetic flux from the sample is collected by a pickup coil ( see fig .",

    "we use the following parameters of a commercially - available squid : @xmath113  nh , @xmath114  @xmath31h . if the sample area @xmath115  @xmath116 ( which corresponds to a cylindrically - shaped sample of radius 5  cm ) , the demagnetization factor @xmath117 , and the optimal number of pickup loop turns is @xmath118 .",
    "these parameters set the value of the expression in the square brackets in eq .",

    "the peak amplitude @xmath154 no longer grows with measurement time , but is a constant .",
    "we estimate this amplitude by breaking up the time - integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b2 ] ) into @xmath155 pieces of duration @xmath130 , and adding them in quadrature , since they have random phase pre - factors .",
    "each piece contributes @xmath156 , thus the total value of the integral is @xmath157 .",
    "if we extracted the measurement sensitivity as in case ( 1 ) , by comparing @xmath154 and @xmath158 , then we would find that the sensitivity does not improve with measurement time .",
    "however , @xmath146 now has a linewidth @xmath153 , which means we now have a signal not just at @xmath125 , but at many frequencies around @xmath125 , the number of independent frequency points is @xmath155 .",
    "we now compare @xmath146 and @xmath145 for each of these frequency points , or fit a lineshape to @xmath159 , given noise in @xmath145 .",
    "as noted above , the scatter of the noise transform points @xmath145 is @xmath129 , and now we can effectively average @xmath155 such points near @xmath125 .",
    "thus the measurement sensitivity @xmath150 is the value of @xmath126 that satisfies @xmath160 , which yields @xmath161      the magnetometer limit to the sensitivity is determined by the ratio between the signal size in eq .   and the magnetometer sensitivity .",
    "the signal will increase linearly in time up to the minimum of @xmath45 and @xmath44 .",
    "the magnetometer noise goes as @xmath164 , so the ratio improves as @xmath165 . then if @xmath45 is shorter than @xmath44 , this ratio will increase @xmath166 up to @xmath44 .",
    "from then on it will increase as @xmath167 , similar to , for example , @xcite ) . using the above scalings with integration time @xmath168 we find the sensitivity curves in fig .",
