    "the dimension 2 gluon condensate @xmath5 in pure yang - mills theory has been proposed in @xcite , and it has been investigated in different ways since then @xcite .    in @xcite an analytical framework for studying this condensate has been developed , based on work carried out in the gross - neveu model @xcite .",
    "different problems had to be overcome .",
    "first of all there is the gauge invariance of this condensate . in order to make the operator @xmath1 gauge invariant",
    ", one can take the minimum of its integral over the gauge orbit . since @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , is positive",
    ", this minimum will always exist . in a general gauge , however , the minimum is a highly nonlocal and thus hard to handle expression of the gauge field .",
    "a minimum is however reached in the landau gauge ( @xmath8 ) , though , so that working in this gauge reduces the operator to a local expression . secondly adding a source @xmath9 , coupled to @xmath1 ,",
    "makes the theory nonrenormalizable at the quantum level . to solve this , a term quadratic in the source must be added , which in turn spoils the energy interpretation for the effective action .",
    "one way around this is to perform the legendre inversion , but this is rather cumbersome , especially so with a general , spacetime dependent source .",
    "one can also use a hubbard - stratonovich transform , which introduces an auxiliary field ( whose interpretation is just the condensate ) and eliminates the term quadratic in the source .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the result was that the yang - mills vacuum favors a finite value for the expectation value of @xmath1 .",
    "the precise renormalization details of the procedure proposed in @xcite were given in @xcite .",
    "recently , chernodub and ilgenfritz @xcite have considered the asymmetry in the dimension two condensate .",
    "they performed lattice simulations , computing the expectation value of the electric - magnetic asymmetry in landau gauge , which they defined as @xmath10 at zero temperature , this quantity must of course be zero due to lorentz invariance .",
    "necessarily it can not diverge as divergences at finite @xmath11 are the same as for @xmath12 , hence this asymmetry is in principle finite and can be computed without renormalization , for all temperatures .",
    "the authors of @xcite found that the high - temperature behavior of the asymmetry had no surprises , following a power law as can be guessed from general thermodynamic arguments .",
    "for the low - temperature behavior , however , one would expect an exponential fall - off with the lowest glueball mass in the exponent , @xmath13 .",
    "instead they found an exponential with a mass @xmath14 significantly smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "so far , there is no explanation for this behavior .",
    "the goal of this work is to construct an analytical framework to investigate the electric - magnetic asymmetry studied numerically in @xcite , with the aim of shedding more light on the results of that paper .",
    "the hope is that something more will be found concerning the light mass scale @xmath14 influencing the thermal behavior of this condensate .",
    "it was also noticed that the behavior of the asymmetry divides the yang - mills phase diagram into three regions in terms of the temperature .",
    "remarkably , these regions seem to coincide with those associated with the condensed , liquid and gaseous states of the magnetic monopoles , whose dynamics are closely related to ( de)confinement , see also @xcite .",
    "the condensate @xmath5 was already related to monopoles in @xcite .",
    "since the computations are rather involved , we will split this work into two papers . in this paper",
    "we present the actual formalism , building on @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the quantity defined in does not need renormalization , it is unclear how to study this object directly with an effective potential approach .",
    "any finite temperature effective potential is a generalization of the @xmath12 potential , however the operator defining makes little sense at @xmath12 as it is not lorentz invariant",
    ". one could think about separately studying the temporal part , @xmath16 , and the spatial part , @xmath17 , but this does not solve the lorentz symmetry problem at @xmath12 : it is unclear how to couple these operators to the action such that lorentz symmetry is maintained , while simultaneously allowing for a study of the ensuing effective potential .",
    "in addition , we would also like to recover the original results for @xmath18 , i.e. we desire a clean @xmath19 limit .",
    "we do solve these problems by considering the operator @xmath3 .",
    "this operator is subsequently split into its trace and its traceless part , yielding @xmath1 and the spacetime asymmetry , @xmath20 .",
    "we shall prove that these two operators are renormalizable at @xmath12 , and that a finite effective potential can be constructed for these , by introducing sources @xmath9 and @xmath21 , which allow to add both operators to the action without jeopardizing lorentz symmetry .",
    "we also explicitly compute the effective potential at zero temperature , and we show that the only minimum is the one found already in @xcite , with a finite expectation value for @xmath1 , but with @xmath22  as one would expect .",
    "this is already a nontrivial result , meaning that there is no dynamical lorentz violation .",
    "at the end , one can take a suitable linear combination of both condensates to retrieve the asymmetry defined in , at any ( non)zero temperature . a priori , it is however more natural to study @xmath1 and @xmath20 than . in a future paper",
    "we shall then focus on the temperature dependence of both @xmath5 itself and the asymmetry .    summarizing the content of the current paper ,",
    "we have given in section ii the renormalization analysis of the operator using the algebraic formalism of @xcite . in section iii",
    "we illustrate that the hubbard - stratonovich transformation can be used to eliminate terms quadratic in the action , and we compute the quantities necessary for the calculation of the effective action . in section",
    "iv finally the effective action itself is computed , and its minima are searched for . in section v the conclusions are presented .",
    "some more technical calculations are bundled in the appendices .",
    "we begin by recalling the expression of the pure yang - mills action in the landau gauge @xmath24 where @xmath25 in order to study the local composite operator ( lco ) @xmath26 , we introduce it in the action by means of a brst  doublet of external sources @xmath27 , symmetrical in the lorentz indices , in the following way @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the brst  nilpotent operator acting as @xmath30 we have shortened the notation by setting @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ ren ] ) we have used the property @xmath32 , hence @xmath33 as is apparent from expressions ( [ sym ] ) and ( [ ren ] ) , the action @xmath34 is brst invariant @xmath35 we notice that we can rewrite the action @xmath36 in terms of @xmath37 , also the vacuum term @xmath38 , since , so we might be tempted to immediately introduce a traceless tensor source @xmath39 coupled to @xmath3 . however , as not all components of @xmath21 can then be considered as independent due to the constraint @xmath40 , using the derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath21 becomes rather tricky , and hence also writing down suitable ward identities .",
    "the current parametrization in terms of a completely general source @xmath41 is thus much more useful .",
    "we draw attention to the fact that we are actually coupling @xmath41 to the ( traceless ) operator @xmath42 meaning that we are considering the renormalization of this particular operator @xmath43 . as we shall soon find out",
    ", we can write down a sufficiently powerful set of ward identities which shall ensure that @xmath44 is a renormalizable operator on its own .    according to the lco philosophy @xcite",
    ", the dimensionless parameter @xmath45 is needed to account for the divergences present in the vacuum green function @xmath46,which shall turn out to be proportional to the specific ( traceless ) combination of @xmath47 and @xmath48 already written down in .    *",
    "* we use the following definition for the derivative w.r.t .",
    "a symmetric source @xmath49 : @xmath50      in order to translate the brst  invariance ( [ si ] ) into the corresponding slavnov - taylor identity , we introduce two further external sources @xmath51 , @xmath52 coupled to the non - linear brst variations of @xmath53 and @xmath54 @xmath55 with @xmath56 therefore , the complete action @xmath57 obeys the following identities    * the slavnov - taylor identity @xmath58 * the landau gauge fixing condition @xmath59 * the antighost equation @xmath60 * the ghost ward identity @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 notice that the term @xmath64 , being linear in the quantum fields @xmath53 , @xmath54 , is a classical breaking . *",
    "thanks to the specific way we introduced the sources @xmath41 , @xmath65 and their traces @xmath66 , @xmath67 , we also have @xmath68    let us also display , for further use , the quantum numbers of all fields and sources entering the action @xmath69 @xmath70      in order to characterize the most general local counterterm which can be freely added to all orders of perturbation theory , we perturb the classical action @xmath69 by adding an arbitrary integrated local polynomial @xmath71 in the fields and external sources of dimension bounded by four and with zero ghost number .",
    "this @xmath71 is however restricted due to the existence of the ward identities .",
    "more precisely , it amounts to impose the following conditions on @xmath71 :    * the linearized slavnov - taylor identity @xmath72 where @xmath73 @xmath74 obeys @xmath75 * the landau gauge fixing condition @xmath76 * the antighost equation @xmath77 * the ghost ward identity @xmath78 * the additional identities @xmath79    taking into account that @xmath80 form a brst doublet , from the general results on the cohomology of yang - mills theories it turns out that the external sources @xmath81 can only contribute through terms which can be expressed as pure @xmath73-variations .",
    "henceforth , the invariant local counterterm @xmath82 can be parametrized as @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a free parameter and @xmath85 is the most general local polynomial with dimension @xmath86 and ghost number @xmath87 , given by @xmath88 with @xmath89 still arbitrary parameters .    from the conditions ( [ b2 ] ) , ( [ b3 ] )",
    ", it consequently follows that @xmath90 and from we find @xmath91 and hence @xmath85 reduces to @xmath92 therefore , for the final form of the most general possible counterterm one obtains .",
    "we have left the @xmath93 in front of the operators instead of writing @xmath86 , as this is important in order to get the correct finite parts once calculating in @xmath93 dimensions . ]",
    "@xmath94 finally , it remains to discuss the stability of the classical action , i.e.  to check whether @xmath71 can be reabsorbed in the classical action @xmath69 by means of a multiplicative renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath95 , the parameters @xmath45 , the fields @xmath96 and the sources @xmath97 , namely @xmath98 with the bare fields , sources and parameters defined as @xmath99 and @xmath100 the infinitesimal perturbation parameter .",
    "notice that for consistency , we should find that @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "the parameters @xmath84 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 turn out to be related to the renormalization of the gauge coupling constant @xmath95 , of the fields @xmath53 , @xmath54 and of the sources @xmath66 , @xmath41 , @xmath45 according to @xmath108 concerning the other fields and the sources @xmath51 , @xmath52 , it can be verified that they renormalize as @xmath109 this completes the proof of the multiplicative renormalizability of the lco @xmath43 in the landau gauge : the action is renormalizable , where the @xmath110-factor of @xmath41 is equal to the @xmath110-factor of @xmath66 , as required .",
    "the current problem is that the operator @xmath1 can not be studied with the action . indeed , if we set @xmath112 and consequently @xmath113 , then the action @xmath114 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , from a physical point of view , we also need @xmath1 as operator , therefore we consider the following action : @xmath115 with @xmath116 in this fashion , we coupled @xmath111 again to the action , with a doublet @xmath117 : @xmath118 the action allows us to study the lcos @xmath1 and @xmath43 . clearly , these 2 operators correspond to the decomposition of @xmath3 into its trace and traceless components .      the action @xmath119 obeys the same ward identities as the action @xmath120 ( see eq .  ) , only the slavnov - taylor identity is slightly modified : @xmath121 and we also have an extra identity , @xmath122 therefore the counterterm obeys the following linearized slavnov - taylor identity @xmath123 where @xmath73 @xmath124 and it is also restricted by @xmath125 after imposing all the ward identities",
    ", we find for the counterterm @xmath126 with @xmath127 given in .",
    "notice that , due to the additional ward identity , no mixing occurs between @xmath128 and @xmath66 .",
    "this is a powerful result . a priori",
    ", a mixing between @xmath43 and @xmath129 can not be excluded .",
    "absorbing the counterterm back into the original action @xmath119 gives the additional @xmath110-factors ( all the others are the same as before ) @xmath130 summarizing our result so far , we have seen that we had to introduce 2 ( independent ) sources to discuss the renormalization of @xmath3 and @xmath1 , and this by means of the action @xmath119 . at the end of the story ,",
    "we have identified the two independently renormalizable operators @xmath43 and @xmath1 .",
    "this also means that the vacuum divergences @xmath131 and the renormalization factor @xmath132 remains unchanged compared with the cases already studied in @xcite .",
    "the next step will be to calculate the effective potential . notice that this can be done relatively close along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we depart from the action @xmath119 and set all the external sources equal to zero , except @xmath41 and @xmath9 .      in this section , we shall get rid of the unwanted quadratic source dependence by the introduction of 2 hubbard - stratonovich fields .",
    "we start by writing down the complete action @xmath119 , where we have set all the external sources equal to zero , except @xmath41 and @xmath9 , @xmath133 the energy functional can be written as @xmath134[{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}c][{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\overline c][{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}b ] { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{e}}}^{-\\sigma'}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now rewrite the action as @xmath135 where we have used the abbreviation @xmath136 and where we have used the bare quantities .",
    "we can then rewrite the action in terms of finite fields and sources .",

    "we used a specific ( traceless ) combination , @xmath143 with @xmath144 , the reason wherefore shall become clear soon .",
    "let us define the following abbreviation @xmath145 , @xmath146 which is traceless , just like @xmath21 . now performing the hubbard - stratonovich transformations yields @xmath147[{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}c][{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\overline c][{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}b ] [ { \\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\sigma][{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}\\phi_{\\mu\\nu } ] \\exp\\left[- \\int{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{d}}}^d x \\left ( \\mathcal l(a_\\mu , \\sigma , \\phi_{\\mu\\nu } )    - \\mu^{-\\epsilon/2 } \\frac{\\sigma}{g }   j   - \\mu^{-\\epsilon/2 } \\frac{\\varphi_{\\mu\\nu}}{g } k_{\\mu\\nu } \\right ) \\right]\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath148\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that by the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , we have removed the terms @xmath149 respectively @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively @xmath152 .",
    "the sources @xmath9 and @xmath21 are now linearly coupled to @xmath153 and @xmath154 as one can observe in equation .",
    "hence , the usual 1pi formalism applies , with the following identification , @xmath155 which follows easily from acting with @xmath156 and @xmath157 on the equivalent generating functionals @xmath158 and @xmath159 and setting @xmath160 , @xmath161 .",
    "here we can also clearly appreciate the role of the traceless combination @xmath145 used in : it ensures that in the final action the traceless combination @xmath162 appears , as @xmath163      to this point , we did not yet determine the two lco parameters @xmath164 and @xmath45 . in this section",
    "we shall do so by deriving a differential equation for @xmath164 and @xmath45 , in an analogous way as in @xcite . in order to do so",
    ", we shall adapt the notation a bit , and define @xmath165 and @xmath166 as follows , @xmath167 we further define the following anomalous dimensions , @xmath168 let us first consider the case without @xmath43 , i.e. we set @xmath169 . to determine a differential equation for @xmath164 , we take the derivative of the first equation of w.r.t .",
    "@xmath170 , @xmath171 as we can consider @xmath164 as a function of @xmath172 , we can rewrite the previous equation as @xmath173 with @xmath174 a finite function of @xmath172 .",
    "this particular choice of @xmath175 is the unique one which ensures a linear renormalization group equation for the generating functional @xmath176 while keeping multiplicative renormalizability for @xmath164 ; is solved with a laurent series in @xmath172 , @xmath177 by keeping in mind that the @xmath178-function starts at order @xmath179 , while a typical anomalous dimension at order @xmath172 .",

    "there is no explicit reference anymore to neither @xmath164 nor @xmath45 , as these lco parameters obey their renormalization group running by construction .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the determination of the anomalous dimension of the @xmath196 operator to three loops in the @xmath197 scheme , as well as the divergence structure of its associated vacuum energy .",
    "these clearly extend the analogous results for the original @xmath198 , which were derived in @xcite . whilst we follow the same procedures here as @xcite , there are some novel features associated with treating an operator with free lorentz indices , especially since it is also traceless .",
    "first , we note that we take the same general point of view as @xcite and include @xmath199 flavours of massless quarks and for the moment also consider the operator in an arbitrary linear covariant gauge with parameter @xmath200 . at the end",
    "we will return to yang - mills and the landau gauge @xmath200  @xmath201  @xmath202 .",
    "the reason for taking the more general scenario is that ironically with several additional parameters present the renormalization constants we will determine have more internal consistency checks .",
    "this gives us greater confidence in the final explicit expressions .",
    "moreover , as the operator has free lorentz indices , not only is there no operator mixing with the operator @xmath198 , unlike that operator there is equally no mixing with any faddeev - popov ghost dependent operator .",
    "therefore , the renormalization of the operator @xmath196 as defined in eq .",
    "is multiplicative .",
    "we will use dimensional regularization in @xmath93  @xmath201  @xmath86  @xmath203  @xmath204 dimensions to exploit the power of the calculational machinery of the mincer algorithm , @xcite , where @xmath205  @xmath201  @xmath206 in this article .",
    "the algorithm is encoded , @xcite , in the symbolic manipulation language form , @xcite , and is the only viable means to achieve the goal of the three loop renormalization constants and anomalous dimension in a significantly reasonable amount of time .",
    "we also note that having the three loop results available at this stage , aside from gaining confidence in the correctness of the two loop results , means that the groundwork is actually laid for the future extension of our effective potential to two loops .    first ,",
    "to renormalize @xmath196 we insert it into a gluon @xmath207-point function and nullify the momentum of one external gluon leg .",
    "this is in order to comply with the conditions of the mincer algorithm which determines three loop scalar massless @xmath207-point functions to the finite part in dimensional regularization .",
    "concerning the gluon external leg momentum nullification , given that each triple gluon vertex carries a numerator momentum , this procedure does not introduce any spurious infrared singularities which could plague , say , a similar procedure in a scalar field theory .",
    "by contrast , the renormalization of @xmath198 proceeded by inserting the extended brst invariant operator in a ghost @xmath207-point function , @xcite . this reduced the number of internal gluon lines , resulting in a significantly fast evaluation , since mincer relies heavily on integration by parts .",
    "an increase in internal momenta slows programme speed . whilst we could insert @xmath196 into a ghost @xmath207-point function , with appropriate momentum nullification",
    ", the three loop mincer algorithm could only produce two loop renormalization constants for the operator renormalization constant .",
    "we therefore have to choose the gluon @xmath207-point function for the operator renormalization and accept slower run times . either way , however , one would still first have to give the mincer routine scalar integrals .",
    "for the green function we consider , @xmath208 , there are four free lorentz indices and therefore one first needs to construct a lorentz tensor projector",
    ". ordinarily one would derive the most general tensor objects built from the momentum @xmath209 and the metric tensor , @xmath210 , with four free indices in such a way that the tensor is consistent with the tracelessness and symmetry of the free indices of the operator .",
    "clearly there will be more than one such independent tensor . given",
    "whatever choice of basis is made , the scalar amplitude associated with each independent tensor can be deduced by inverting the tensor basis . however , as we are not actually interested in the finite parts of the green function @xmath211 but only its divergence structure we need only find one projector .",
    "this should be chosen to give a non - trivial tree contribution to ensure there is a counterterm available to absorb the infinity which defines the operator renormalization .",
    "moreover , it ought to be chosen so as not to increase computer run times , especially for the three loop feynman diagrams . given these considerations we have projected with the tensor @xmath212 the feynman diagrams contributing to @xmath208 are generated by the qgraf package , @xcite , and the output converted to form input notation by appending colour , lorentz and spinor indices as well as the internal momenta consistent with the mincer topology definitions , @xcite . for this calculation",
    "there are @xmath207 one loop , @xmath213 two loop and @xmath214 three loop feynman diagrams to be calculated .",
    "we follow the algorithm of @xcite to extract the renormalization constant associated with @xmath196 defined by @xmath215 where @xmath216 denotes a bare object .",
    "this algorithm , @xcite , in essence is such that one computes the green functions for bare parameters and then scales to renormalized quantities at the end via the usual definitions .",
    "the overall divergence which remains after the external fields have been renormalized is absorbed by the as yet undetermined renormalization constant @xmath217 .",
    "as this renormalization is multiplicative then this is easy to implement automatically within a form programme .",
    "the result of our computation is the @xmath197 expression for the anomalous dimension @xmath218\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with corresponding renormalization factor @xmath219 \\left ( \\frac{g^2 n } { 16 \\pi^2}\\right)^2+\\left[-\\frac{82563}{432}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^3}+\\frac{99627}{864}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}+\\frac{2754\\zeta(3)-196111}{7776}\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right ] \\left ( \\frac{g^2 n } { 16 \\pi^2}\\right)^3\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , we have given the full expression for arbitrary gauge parameter and quark flavours in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "for that result and by implication for ( [ res1 ] ) , the anomalous dimension passes all the usual internal consistency checks .",
    "specifically the extracted @xmath197 renormalization constant is a laurent series in @xmath220 .",
    "therefore the double and triple poles in @xmath220 are predicted by the simple poles from lower loop order due to the renormalization group equation since we are dealing with a renormalizable operator .",
    "our renormalization constant successfully satisfied this check . as an additional check on our computer code , such as",
    "the correct qgraf generation of diagrams and mapping to mincer and form syntax , we have rerun the complete code for the calculation again but instead used the operator @xmath198 .",
    "we obtained the known three loop anomalous dimension for the landau gauge , @xcite .",
    "the arbitrary @xmath200 expression in this instance is not actually a check for this purpose for several reasons .",
