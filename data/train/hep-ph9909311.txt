    "the hadronic width of the @xmath0 lepton , @xmath4 plays an important role in the determination of the qcd coupling @xcite . for this analysis",
    "it is essential to minimize the sensitivity to low energy data @xcite using different integral moments .",
    "in addition , by integrating the data on spectral functions up @xmath5 we can simulate the physics of hypothetical @xmath0 leptons@xcite with smaller @xmath5 than the real one . since their hadronic widths are related to the @xmath6 annihilation cross section into hadrons @xmath7",
    "through @xmath8 they provide tests of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to report on several different applications motivated by the above relation , where we proposed self - consistency tests of pqcd , applicable to any observable which defines an effective charge @xcite , as well as a method to measure the gell - mann  low function of some of these observables @xcite .",
    "an effective charge defined from an observable contain its entire radiative contribution @xcite .",
    "for instance , assuming @xmath9 massless flavors , we have @xmath10,\\nonumber\\\\ r_{\\tau}(m)&\\equiv & r^0_{\\tau}(m ) \\left[1+\\frac{\\alpha_\\tau(m)}{\\pi}\\right ] , \\label{reepqcd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 the effective charges @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be written as a series in @xmath14 in any given renormalization scheme .",
    "in addition we demand that effective charges should also be linear in @xmath15 , such as @xmath16 , and it also must track the bare charge in its coupling to the various quark flavors .",
    "( thus @xmath17 is unacceptable since it is not linear in quark flavor ) .",
    "their relevance is due to the fact that they satisfy the renormalization group equation with the same coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 as @xmath15 .    as a consequence of the mean value theorem applied to eq.([defrt ] ) , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are simply related by a scale shift @xmath20 .",
    "however we can use nlo leading twist qcd to _ predict _ @xmath21 , \\label{csstau}\\ ] ] this result was first obtained in @xcite by using the nnlo , and it is a particular example of a `` commensurate scale relation '' @xcite which relate observables at two different scales .",
    "we will now see that it is due to the fact that both effective charges evolve with universal @xmath18 and @xmath19 coefficients @xcite .",
    "the previous relations can be generalized to an arbitrary observable @xmath22 , with an associated effective charge @xmath23 , by defining new effective charges @xmath24 where we can choose @xmath25 to be any smooth , integrable function of @xmath26 . once again",
    "@xmath27 let us remark that this relation _ involves only data for @xmath22 _ and is therefore a self - consistency test of the leading twist qcd approximation .",
    "the relation between the commensurate scales is obtained if we consider the running of @xmath23 up to third order @xmath28 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_o(m)}{\\pi}\\right)^3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we substitute for @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ alpharf ] ) , to find @xmath29 \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_o(m)}{\\pi}\\right)^3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 .",
    "thus , @xmath31 is    @xmath32}. \\label{sstar}\\ ] ]    since @xmath33 is constant to leading order , @xmath34 satisfies the same renormalization group equation as @xmath23 with the same coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; i.e. , @xmath34 is an effective charge .      for illustrative purposes , we will set @xmath35 , since the data is known to present problems in some energy ranges , but a good agreement with qcd in others .",
    "we will see that our test is able to detect these problematic regions . in order to suppress the low energy effects , where non - perturbative effects are important , we shall set @xmath36 , with @xmath37 some positive number .",
    "thus @xmath38 when comparing with @xmath7 data , we take into account finite mass effects using @xcite : @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & r_0(\\sqrt{s})+r_{sch}(\\sqrt{s})\\frac{\\alpha_r(\\sqrt{s})}{\\pi } \\label{rsch } \\\\ g(v)&=&\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{2v}-\\frac{3+v}{4}\\left ( \\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\frac{3}{4\\pi}\\right)\\right]\\label{g(v)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the velocity of the initial quarks in their cm frame .",
    "the @xmath41 factor is the parton model mass dependence and @xmath42 is a qcd modification of the schwinger correction .",
    "the quark masses have been taken as effective parameters which provide a good fit to the smeared data .",
    "these corrections spoil eq.([atk ] ) , but they are only important near the quark thresholds . since we recover eq.([reepqcd ] ) at higher energies , our study is restricted to this regime .",
    "since the data is on annihilation into hadrons , not quarks , we can not use directly our formulae , although we can define smeared quantities @xcite as follows : @xmath43 the smearing of @xmath7 over a range of energy , @xmath44 , is indeed a smearing over time @xmath45 , where an analysis in terms of quarks and gluons is appropriate .",
    "we have used the standard value @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the smearing effect can be seen by comparing the data interpolation in fig.1.a , ( see @xcite for references ) with fig .",
    "note that _ any fit using the qcd functional dependence will always satisfy _",
    "eq.([atk ] ) .",
    "that is why we have parameterized the narrow resonances with their breit - wigner form , and we have interpolated the remaining data ( see @xcite for details ) .    finally , using eqs.([rsch ] ) and ( [ smear ] )",
    ", we define smeared charges : @xmath47 and similarly for @xmath48 . as we have just commented , the smeared charges are expected to satisfy eq.([sstar ] ) at energies where the threshold corrections are negligible .    in fig.2.a",
    "we show the comparison between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the rather poor agreement for @xmath51 is due to the fact that the low energy region is not suppressed enough .",
    "in contrast there is a fairly good agreement for @xmath52 in several regions , which disappears when the scales are not shifted as in eq.([atk ] ) .",
    "as we have commented there are two regions of particular interest : first , from 5 to 10 gev , since the data from two different experiments are incompatible ( see fig.1.a and ref.@xcite ) .",
    "even though we have kept the most recent data in our calculations , their central values are systematically lower than the qcd predictions .",
    "our test correctly points out this incompatibility .",
    "comparison between @xmath53 and different @xmath48 moments at @xmath54 .",
    "the dotted line shows how the agreement is spoilt if we do not shift @xmath55 to @xmath5 .",
    "* b ) * comparison between @xmath53 and different @xmath48 moments at @xmath54 in the low energy region .",
    "second , we show in fig . 2.b .",
    "the energy region of the real @xmath0 .",
    "taking into account that we are just using lo qcd and central data values , the agreement is fairly good , which supports the applicability of pqcd at energies near the physical @xmath0 lepton .",
    "nevertheless , at @xmath56 gev , it seems that the there is an small discrepancy of the order of 6 - 7% , which also supports previous claims that @xmath7 data is lower than expected from @xmath57 data @xcite .",
    "note , however , that we have reached our conclusions using _ only data on @xmath7_.",
    "given an observable @xmath22 , let us generalize the definition of new effective charges to include arbitrary scales in the integral @xmath58 the generalization of eq.([alpharf ] ) to obtain an effective charge @xmath59 is straightforward .",
    "again we find a commensurate scale relation @xmath60 , with @xmath61 _ predicted _ by qcd @xcite .",
    "but if we differentiate @xmath62-(2k+2 ) o_{k}(\\lambda)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is basically @xmath63 .",
    "note that we have defined @xmath64 .",
    "indeed what we have obtained is the gell - mann  low qcd function @xmath3 ( see ref.@xcite ) , which finally can be written in terms of _ the observable at three energies _ @xmath65.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the advantages of this method are that it eliminates the errors from finite difference approximations , and that it is competitive with a standard fit but it has very different systematics .",
    "the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath57 , as well as the ideas of commensurate scale relations , have motivated a number of new tests of perturbative qcd , as well the means for measuring the qcd @xmath3 gell - mann  low function .",
    "the advantage of these methods is that , although they are inspired in a relation between two observables , at the end they only relate one observable with itself .    these tests , which are renormalization scheme and scale independent , are applicable over wide energy ranges to any observable which defines an effective charge .",
    "as an example , we have tested the self - consistency of existing @xmath7 data according to pqcd , finding a good agreement in the real @xmath0 region but incompatibilities around the 1.5 gev region and in the range of 5 to 10 gev , supporting previous claims in the literature .",
