    ", we analyze the problem of computing the matrix exponential of semi - infinite matrices of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is such that @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we refer to this class of matrices as quasi - toeplitz , in short , qt - matrices .",
    "the problem of computing the matrix exponential of toeplitz and quasi - toeplitz matrices is encountered in diverse applications , like the erlangian approximation of markovian fluid queues @xcite , @xcite , or the discretization of integro - differential equations with a shift - invariant kernel which describe the pricing of single - asset options modeled by jump - diffusion processes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where matrices are finite but have huge dimensions since their size has an asymptotic meaning .",
    "another simple example comes from the numerical solution of the heat equation @xmath27 where the second derivative in space is discretized with the three - point finite difference formula , so that the equation is reduced to an ordinary differential equation of the kind @xmath28 , being @xmath29 the vector function of the values of @xmath30 at the discretization nodes .",
    "if the spatial domain is infinite , then @xmath31 is a semi - infinite tridiagonal toeplitz matrix and the solution can be expressed as @xmath32 .    in other problems , like the analysis of random walks in the quarter plane @xcite , @xcite , or in the tandem jackson queue @xcite , @xcite , where the number of states is infinite denumerable ,",
    "one encounters semi - infinite probability matrices which are block toeplitz where the blocks have the form @xmath33 , with @xmath34 banded toeplitz and @xmath35 having a finite number of nonzero entries .",
    "these applications make it interesting to design effective algorithms for computing the exponential , and other analytic functions , of matrices which are quasi - toeplitz .",
    "due to its importance , the problem of computing the exponential of a toeplitz matrix has been analyzed in several papers among which @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite where different techniques , like using krylov subspaces or displacement operators , are used effectively .",
    "the analysis of the exponential of infinite matrices is considered in @xcite , @xcite , while truncating to finite size the exponential of a general infinite matrix is considered in @xcite . solving certain matrix polynomial equations with qt matrices as coefficients has been recently considered in @xcite .      in this paper , we provide some theoretical results and some algorithmic advances concerning the computation of the exponential of infinite quasi - toeplitz matrices @xmath5 where @xmath0 is such that @xmath36 is finite .",
    "that is , @xmath7 and @xmath37 belong to the wiener class @xmath38 the approach that we present is general and can be easily applied to the finite case and extended to the computation of more general analytic functions .",
    "we rely on the approximation of @xmath14 given by the taylor series truncation @xmath39 , for a sufficiently large @xmath18 .",
    "we exploit the toeplitz structure of @xmath10 and of its powers by representing @xmath40 as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the taylor series truncation of @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a suitable correction .",
    "more precisely , we prove that if the function @xmath7 is such that @xmath45 , then the matrix exponential @xmath46 is well defined by its power series expansion @xmath47 and is still of the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "that is , @xmath14 has a _ toeplitz component _ and a _ correction component_. the former , represented by the coefficients @xmath51 , @xmath52 , can be easily approximated to any precision by applying the evaluation and interpolation technique at the roots of the unity to the equation @xmath53 .",
    "the correction @xmath54 can be approximated to any precision by means of an easily computable recurrence which generates a sequence of matrices @xmath44 such that @xmath55 .",
    "this representation of a function of a toeplitz matrix differs from those given in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite which rely on the displacement operator and displacement rank .",
    "the idea of representing the infinite matrix @xmath14 as a toeplitz part associated with a suitable function plus a correction having a finite sum of the moduli of its entries , is fundamental to deal with _",
    "infinite _ matrices by using only a _",
    "finite _ number of parameters .",
    "in fact , the coefficients @xmath56 of a function @xmath57 such that @xmath58 , decay to zero as @xmath59 so that @xmath60 can be approximated by means of a laurent polynomial @xmath61 , for @xmath62 sufficiently large . moreover , the finiteness of the sum @xmath63 allows one to approximate @xmath54 with a finite matrix generally of small rank .    the decomposition @xmath5 is quite natural and widely used in the analysis of spectral properties of sequences @xmath64 of @xmath65 toeplitz - like matrices where the additive decomposition is given as the sum of a toeplitz part , plus a matrix of small rank plus a matrix of small norm .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite for the basic properties and for a list of references in this regard .",
    "the same kind of decomposition is described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 2.28 ) where , unlike in this paper , it is assumed that the correction @xmath35 is a compact operator in @xmath66 .",
    "the boundedness of the operator norm @xmath67 is not enough for our computational goals since it does not imply the boundedness of @xmath68 .",
    "the representation of a matrix as sum of a toeplitz part and a correction is described pictorially in figure [ fig1 ] where the exponential of @xmath34 is shown for @xmath69 .",
    "the two components @xmath70 , i.e. , the toeplitz part , and the `` compact '' correction @xmath54 are displayed together with their sum .",
    "the same approach can be applied to the finite case , where the correction @xmath54 involves both the north - west and the south - east corners . in the finite case ,",
    "the advantage of this representation is much appreciated if the size of the matrix is larger than the rank of the correction .",
    "our approach is more effective when the exponential of the qt - matrix has a large decay of the band .",
    "in fact , in this case , both the degree of the laurent polynomial which approximates @xmath43 and the rank of the correction matrix @xmath54 are small .",
    "the analysis of the decay of the band of matrix functions , and more specifically of toeplitz matrices , has been recently performed in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the decay of singular values of matrices with low displacement rank , including positive definite hankel matrices , has been performed in @xcite .",
    "an immediate consequence of our results is that the exponential of a quasi - toeplitz matrix can be approximated up to any error @xmath71 by a banded matrix .",
    "the acceleration techniques , based on scaling the variable @xmath10 and squaring the exponential of the scaled matrix , can be applied to reduce the number of terms in the power series expansion needed to reach a sufficiently accurate approximation .",
    "similarly , our approach can be combined with pad approximation to reduce the cost of the computation .",
    "the algorithm that we have obtained this way has been implemented in matlab and tested with some `` synthetic '' problems and with some matrices taken from the applications .    from the numerical experiments it turns out that the correction component @xmath54 such that @xmath72 , has generally very low rank .",
    "the same holds for the correction @xmath73 such that @xmath74 .",
    "this property , which will be object of our future research analysis , is at the basis of the effectiveness of our algorithm .",
    "extensions of this approach with the implementation of quasi - toeplitz matrix arithmetic are given in @xcite , applications to general analytic functions either expressed as power series or as cauchy integrals and the algorithmic analysis of the finite case are treated in @xcite .     + =     + +    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall some preliminary results concerning semi - infinite toeplitz matrices , introduce the norms @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and recall that the linear space @xmath77 formed by semi - infinite matrices @xmath54 such that @xmath78 is finite is a banach algebra . in section 3 we consider the case of a toeplitz matrix @xmath34 .",
    "we prove that if @xmath45 then @xmath79 where @xmath80 and give an explicit relation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "this relation enables us to provide a bound to @xmath83 given in terms of @xmath84 and of @xmath85 . in section 4",
    "we extend these results to the case of a qt matrix @xmath5 . in section 5",
    "we describe in detail the algorithm for computing the exponential of a toeplitz matrix and we outline the case of a qt matrix .",
    "section 6 reports the results of some numerical experiments while section 7 draws some final remarks and conclusions .",
