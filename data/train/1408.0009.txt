    "evidence collected over the past several years increasingly supports the general picture that low mass stars ( lms ) and brown dwarfs ( bds ) , likely share a common formation mechanism . however , there are many open questions that remain to be addressed . for example , given typical temperatures and densities within molecular cloud cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the corresponding classical jeans mass can be much higher than the sub - stellar mass limit ( @xmath9 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that forming bds would be difficult under such conditions . however , we know that not only do lms and bds form , but they do so abundantly , being the most numerous objects in the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , their formation can not be explained in terms of a simple - minded model of gravitational collapse alone , which has been an important driver of theoretical and observational efforts looking for the physical processes and conditions that control lms and bd formation .",
    "theoretical efforts to explain the formation of lms and bds are usually classified in the following models , reviewed by @xcite : ( i ) turbulent fragmentation , ( ii ) gravitational fragmentation ( iii ) disc fragmentation ( iv ) premature ejection of protostellar embryos and ( v ) photo - erosion of cores in hii regions .",
    "these processes are not mutually exclusive @xcite in the sense that in a typical star forming region ( sfr ) all of them could take place simultaneously , resulting in a complex scenario .",
    "the relative importance of each model is currently explored in terms of its ability to reproduce observables such as the initial mass function ( imf ) , the properties of binary and multiple systems , the fraction of lms and bds showing circumstellar discs , magnetosferic accretion and/or outflows and studying the kinematic or spatial segregation as a function of stellar mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "each model has proven its plausibility of forming lms and bds , though only a few of the available simulations offer results directly comparable with observational data , and several assumptions about the initial conditions are still a matter of debate .",
    "observationally , several sfrs and young clusters have been surveyed looking for their lms and bd population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "some important results are : the continuity of the mass function across the sub - stellar mass limit ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the existence of circumstellar discs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , accretion phenomena ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and photometric variability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in bds , which indicate the extension of the t - tauri behaviour below the sub - stellar mass limit .",
    "there is also some initial insight on mass segregation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mass - dependent kinematics ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and multiplicity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we present a new , deep optical / near infrared photometric survey of the 25 orionis group , combined with limited follow - up spectroscopy , to search for and characterise the lms ( @xmath10 ) and bd ( @xmath11 ) members of this population .",
    "the relevance of the 25 orionis group for studies of star / disc formation and early evolution is given by its @xmath17 myr old age which roughly corresponds to the time when dissipation of primordial circumstellar discs is expected to have finished ( @xmath110 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as evidenced by the decrease in disc fractions @xcite .",
    "additionally , the study of the spatial distribution of members and/or the imf down to the bd regime at this age , is important to constraint the dynamical evolution of young clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "other associations of similar age are either too spatially extended because of their vicinity ( e.g. tw hydra , @xmath12 pictoris , @xmath13 cha ; * ? ? ? * ) or too distant ( e.g. ngc7160 , ngc2169 , ngc2362 * ? ? ?",
    "lacerta ob1b at a distance of @xmath1400 pc and an estimated age within 12 to 16 myr , is probably one of the best places to carry out new surveys for young lms and bd , however , it also spans @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "another interesting region , also spanning a large area of the sky , is the upper scorpius association at a distance between 125 and 165 pc @xcite , whose last age determination is @xmath111 myr old @xcite . summarizing , the 25 orionis group is the most numerous and spatially dense @xmath17 myr old population yet known within @xmath1500 pc from the sun .",
    "its modest angular extent ( @xmath15 ) makes comprehensive studies of its entire population feasible , and being almost free of significant interstellar extinction , it is the ideal place to study slightly more evolved young lms and bd .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ 25ori ] we summarize previous results on the 25 orionis group . in section [ observations ]",
    "we describe the observations , data reduction , photometric candidate selection , as well as the spectroscopic confirmation of memberships for a sub - sample of these candidates . in section [ extinctcontam ]",
    "we estimate and analyse the visual interstellar extinction affecting each photometric candidate and spectroscopically confirmed member , and estimate the contamination from field stars present in the sample of photometric candidates . in section [ analysis ]",
    "we present the derivation of masses and ages , the analysis of the imf , the analysis of the spatial distribution and infrared excesses as disc indicators and accretion signatures . in section [ conclutions ]",
    "we summarize our conclusions about the nature of the 25 orionis group and explore possible implications on predictions from theoretical models for lms and bd formation .",
    "the 25 orionis group was originally identified by @xcite as a @xmath16 radius overdensity of @xmath17 pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars roughly centred on the be star 25 ori located at @xmath1805:24:44.8 , @xmath19 + 01:50:47.20 .",
    "it was recognized on the basis of multi - epoch v and i - band photometry and follow - up optical spectroscopy to confirm memberships .",
    "their initial member sample spanned magnitudes @xmath20 , corresponding to masses in the range @xmath217 myr and distance modulus of 7.78 mag ] .",
    "@xcite reported a mean age for the orion ob1a sub - association , which includes the 25 orionis overdensity , of @xmath22 myr and an inner - disc frequency of @xmath23 per cent , smaller than the @xmath24 per cent they had found in the younger ( @xmath25 myr ) orion ob1b sub - association .",
    "these results were consistent with the decrease in disc fraction with age seen in other regions @xcite , and supported the idea that inner discs around low - mass stars dissipate in less than @xmath26 myr @xcite .",
    "the newly identified 25 orionis group was also recognized a few months later by @xcite in their extensive survey of new galactic clusters , and listed as cluster ascc-16 .",
    "they derive central coordinates @xmath185:24:36 , @xmath19 + 01:48:00 , a cluster radius=@xmath27 and core radius=@xmath28 .",
    "they estimate a distance of 460 pc ( @xmath29 ) , reddening @xmath30 , age @xmath31 myr , and a mean radial velocity of @xmath32 km / s .",
    "however , the radial velocity comes from only one star , 25 ori itself , and the age , distance and cluster radius are based on just a small number of stars earlier than k3 .",
    "the low - mass population of the 25 orionis group was later considered by @xcite .",
    "his variability - based survey of orion ob1 using multi - epoch photometry from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , within a @xmath33 wide equatorial strip located roughly @xmath34 south of the star 25 ori . based on the spatial distribution of his and @xcite samples",
    ", @xcite suggested that the 25 orionis group could extend further south , with a total radius of @xmath35 , greater than previously reported .",
    "@xcite suggested that the 25 orionis group is an unbound association and derived a classical t - tauri star ( ctts ) fraction of @xmath26 per cent in what he called the 25 orionis group .",
    "discs around the low - mass ( @xmath36 ) members of 25 orionis were searched for and characterised by @xcite in their spitzer irac and mips imaging study of this group .",
    "they found that in the 25 orionis group , discs around low - mass stars are less frequent ( @xmath37 per cent ) than in the younger ( @xmath38 myr ) orion ob1b ( @xmath39 per cent ) , and that this frequency seemed to be a function of the spectral type with a maximum around m0 .",
    "they also determined that disc dissipation takes place faster in the inner region of the discs ; as suggested by several disc models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after the initial discovery and first studies , @xcite conducted the most extensive assessment so far of the low - mass population ( @xmath40 ) in the 25 orionis group .",
    "they concluded that not only is 25 orionis a kinematically distinct entity , but it is also different in velocity space from the widely spread stellar population of orion ob1a , within which it is located .",
    "these results pointed to the idea of the 25 orionis group as a physical stellar group , akin to structures like the @xmath41 ori cluster . from the spatial distribution of the low - mass members they found a maximum surface density of @xmath42 stars/@xmath43 with masses @xmath44 , and derived a cluster radius of @xmath1 7 pc . in this work they also redetermined the fraction of classical ttauri stars ( ctts ) using a more numerous sample , and find disc fractions of @xmath37 per cent in 25 orionis and @xmath39 per cent in ori ob1b , confirming the factor of @xmath45 decline in the accretor fraction seen by @xcite .",
    "the 25 orionis group had been also the target for several other works : using the spitzer irac and mips data , @xcite studied the debris disc fraction in stars with spectral types earlier than f5 in the 25 orionis group . @xcite",
    "measured abundances for 8 t tauri stars with spectral types from k7 to m0 and derived an average metallicity @xmath46fe / h@xmath47$]=-0.05@xmath480.05 .",
    "@xcite , have studied the x - ray and far ultraviolet fluxes of 25 orionis and determined accretion rates for a set of members with spectral types k5 to m5 .",
    "most recently , 25 orionis has been a hunting ground for groups looking for transiting planets among young solar - like stars @xcite . in table [ parameters ] we summarize the derived parameters we assume here for the 25 orionis group , based on the aforementioned studies and the present work . in figure [ figradec1 ]",
    "we show the spatial distribution of candidates and confirmed members from previous surveys .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : trans ]    the samples of new confirmed members and candidates are not affected by the photometric completeness of the irac observations and the reported fractions are not biased towards the objects showing excesses .",
    "the number fraction of bd showing ir excesses turns out to be systematically higher in all colour - colour diagrams suggesting that at an age of @xmath49 myr the disc fraction among bds is larger than for lms which could be an indicator of a slow evolution of discs around bds .",
    "this supports previous results from @xcite for the upper scorpius association which with a estimated age of @xmath50myr @xcite shows @xmath125 per cent of objects later than m5 harbouring discs .",
    "our results at a slight younger age support the scenario in which discs around lms and bd evolve in different time scales in the sense that a higher fraction of bds could retain their discs for longer periods of time .",
    "finally , low - resolution spectra provide an appropriate means to look for ctts emission signatures such as h@xmath51 , the caii triplet ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) and hei @xmath55 .",
    "the dividing line between ctts and weak ( non - accreting ) t - tauri stars ( wtts ) was first set in terms of the h@xmath51 emission at w(h@xmath51 ) @xmath56  by @xcite .",
    "afterwards , @xcite revised this classification and , based on high resolution optical spectra ( @xmath57 ) , redefined the classification considering both the h@xmath51 equivalent width and the spectral type . @xcite using low - resolution optical spectra developed an empirical classification method based on the h@xmath51 equivalent width and the spectral type .",
    "here we followed the criteria from @xcite to classify the confirmed lms as ctts or wtts .",
    "figure [ fighast ] shows the resulting classification in the @xmath58 vs. spectral - type plot .",
    "we obtained a number fraction of ctts to wtts of @xmath59 per cent for objects earlier than m6 .",
    "our results are consistent with those from the colour - colour diagrams and with previous determinations by @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the number fraction of ctts presented here is larger than the fraction reported by @xcite ( @xmath60 per cent ) that , as we explained in section [ spatial ] , most probably does not correspond to the 25 orionis group .     versus spectral type and effective temperature ( upper axis ) for the new confirmed lms members .",
    "dotted lines indicate the limit between ctts and wtts according to @xcite .",
    "circles indicates objects showing equivalent width of @xmath61 consistent with ctts .",
    "arrows indicate objects with strong @xmath61 emission whose @xmath62 is labelled .",
    "we found 3.8 @xmath48 0.5 per cent of the members of 25 orionis group being ctts ( open circles).,width=302 ]",
    "we have presented the first extensive study of the lower mass population ( @xmath63 ) of the 25 ori group and its surrounding regions . we provide for this mass range the spatial distribution , mean age , imf , and investigate the presence of circumstellar discs and accretion signatures . in the following",
    "we summarize our results :    * we have obtained a sample of 1246 photometric candidates to lms and bds in the 25 ori group and its surroundings with estimated masses within @xmath64 , as well as 77 new lms spectroscopically confirmed as members with spectral types in the range @xmath1m1 to @xmath1m5 .",
    "* we have characterised the possible contamination of our photometric candidate sample using the besanon galactic model @xcite .",
    "the expected mean contamination was found to be @xmath65 field dwarf stars from the foreground per @xmath66 , which yields an expected average efficiency of @xmath67 per cent for our photometric candidate selection .",
    "* from the age distributions of the photometric candidates and confirmed members we find mean ages of @xmath68 myr and @xmath69 myr respectively .",
    "these results are in good agreement with those reported by @xcite .",
    "* we have derived the system - imf for 25 ori from a numerous sample of photometric candidate lms and bds previously corrected by the contamination from field stars .",
    "we have obtained a system - imf which can be well described by either a kroupa power - law function with indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the mass ranges @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , or a scalo log - normal function with coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath72 in the mass range @xmath73 . for the log - normal representation of the imf we obtained that the characteristic mass is consistent with an imf independent of environmental properties ,",
    "although the standard deviation is smaller than the system - imf from @xcite . a sensitive photometric survey for the detection of a complete sample of bd down to @xmath74 , and their spectroscopic counterparts is needed to confirm the slightly lower value of the standard deviation and whether this trend of the system - imf is a consequence of a real deficit of bds . * from the analysis of the spatial distribution of the photometric candidate sample we find the peak of the 25 orionis overdensity at @xmath75 with a diameter of @xmath76 pc .",
    "we have confirmed the east - west elongation of the 25 orionis group , also observed in the works from @xcite and @xcite , and rule out the southern extension proposed by @xcite .",
    "additionally we found that the 25 orionis group is projected over a filament distributed along the south - west to north - east direction .",
    "we have also found that the spatial distributions of lms and bds in 25 orionis are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "* for the lms we calculated the number fraction of stars showing ir excess in the j - h vs h - ks diagram according to the ctts locus from @xcite .",
    "we found that @xmath38 per cent of the lms show the levels of ir excess expected from ctts with optically thick primordial discs .",
    "we found similar fractions for the empirical locus defined in the @xmath77 vs @xmath78 colour - colour diagram where we find also that @xmath79 per cent of the bd show ir excesses indicative of primordial discs . * using vista , irac and wise photometry we have also found ir excess at longer wavelengths indicative of discs .",
    "depending on the selected diagram we found that the number fraction of lms showing ir excesses is between @xmath17 to @xmath110 per cent while the number fraction for bds increases up to @xmath120 to @xmath150 per cent .",
    "* additionally we found that 11 members and candidates show signs of possible transitional or evolved discs and that @xmath80 per cent of the lms members show @xmath61 emission consistent with a ctts nature , confirming the ctts number fraction found by @xcite . *",
    "our results show that the fraction of bd showing ir excesses is higher than for lms , supporting the scenario in which the evolution of circumstellar discs around the least massive stars could occur at larger time scales .",
