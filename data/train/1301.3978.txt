    "even though lots of works have been done in the literature , the properties of the light scalar mesons are still in ambiguity . in order to get an accurate theoretical prediction on the properties of the scalar mesons and on their applications to high energy processes , it is very important to provide a good interpretation of their complicated nonperturbative nature .    among the scalar mesons non - perturbative sources ,",
    "one of the most important thing is their light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) . at the present",
    ", some pioneering works for both the twist-2 and twist-3 lcdas of the scalar meson have been done within the qcd sum rules , c.f .",
    "refs.@xcite . according to our experience on the light pseudoscalar twist-3 lcdas , e.g. the pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors  @xcite and the @xmath19 , @xmath20 transition form factors  @xcite , a well - behaved pseudoscalar twist-3 lcdas in the end - point region can give the conventional power suppressed contributions to the high energy processes in comparison to those of twist-2 lcdas .",
    "it is interesting to know whether the scalar twist-3 lcdas also possess such good feature .",
    "moreover , a better understanding of the twist-3 lcdas is crucial for a reliable estimation .",
    "the forthcoming more precise data , e.g. at the large hadronic colliders and the programming super @xmath21 factories , also requires a more accurate theoretical estimation for the twist-3 contributions .    at present",
    ", we will investigate the twist-3 lcdas of the scalar mesons by incorporating such quark mass effects properly so as to achieve a more accurate theoretical prediction . within the qcd sum rules",
    ", it has been found that the contributions from the quark mass terms ( especially those of the @xmath3-quark ) will be comparable to that of the dimension - six operators or even the dimension - four operators , and it can even change the relative importance of the operator expansion series counted by the naive power counting rules , c.f .",
    "refs.@xcite for studying the @xmath22-breaking effects of the kaon lcdas and refs.@xcite for the cases of the vector twist-3 lcdas .    for the purpose",
    ", we will calculate the gegenbauer moments of the twist-3 lcdas for the scalars @xmath0 , @xmath23 and @xmath2 within the qcd sum rules together with the qcd background field approach .",
    "basic assumption of qcd sum rules is the introducing of nonvanishing vacuum condensates such as the dimension - three quark condensate @xmath24 , the dimension - four gluon condensate @xmath25 , and etc .",
    "the qcd background field approach provides a systematic description for those vacuum condensates from the viewpoint of field theory  @xcite .",
    "it assumes that the quark and gluon fields are composed of the background fields and the quantum fluctuations around them .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of those background fields describe the nonperturbative effects , while the quantum fluctuations represent the calculable perturbative effects .",
    "to take the qcd background field theory as the starting point for the qcd sum rules , it not only shows a distinct physical picture but also greatly simplifies the calculation due to its capability of adopting different gauge conditions for quantum fluctuations and background fields respectively .",
    "because of the influence from background fields , the quark and gluon propagators shall include nonperturbative component inevitably , and the quark mass effect can be introduced in a consistent way .",
    "moreover , the @xmath17 transition form factor within the light - cone sum rules ( lcsr ) provides a good platform for checking the properties of the scalar lcdas . in the lcsr approach , a two - point correlation function",
    "is introduced and expanded near the light cone @xmath26 , whose matrix elements are parameterized as lcdas of increasing twists . by using the conventional currents in the correlator , the form factors will always contain the twist-2 and twist-3 terms simultaneously , both of which play important roles for the final lcsrs  @xcite .",
    "because both the twist-2 and twist-3 lcdas have their own uncertainties , the entanglement of them make the estimation under large uncertainty .",
    "thus , for the sake of a better accuracy , it is helpful to choose proper chiral currents in the correlators such that either the twist-2 or the twist-3 terms make no contribution to the lcsrs . in ref.@xcite , a chiral",
    "current has been suggested to make the twist-3 terms give zero contribution . at present",
    ", we shall introduce another type of chiral current such that the twist-2 terms make no contributions .",
    "furthermore , we will deal with the semileptonic decays @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which when in comparing with the forthcoming data shall be helpful for acquiring valuable information on the twist-3 lcdas of the scalar particles .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present the calculation technology for deriving the sum rules for the twist-3 lcda moments of the scalar mesons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . then , we present the formulas for the @xmath17 transition form factors . numerical results and discussions for the scalar mesons twist-3 lcdas and the @xmath17 transition form",
    "factors are given in sec.iii .",
    "the final section is reserved for a summary . in the appendix",
    ", we put the some more subtle points in deriving the sum rules for the twist-3 lcda moments .",
