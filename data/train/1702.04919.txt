    "since its early origins  @xcite entanglement has been considered as one of the most basic and intriguing features of quantum mechanics  @xcite . during the years it has turned out to be a fundamental resource in quantum information  @xcite and has originated a large number of research topics in mathematical  @xcite and applied science with the quantum teleportation technology  @xcite and quantum key distribution protocols  @xcite .",
    "the characterization and quantification of quantum correlations is not a simple task .",
    "bipartite entanglement , i.e. the entanglement of two subsystems , denoted as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , is well understood and can be completely characterized , for instance , using the von neumann entropy  @xcite or the entanglement of formation  @xcite .",
    "another possible measure is the so - called _ purity _ ( of the relevant subsystem ) @xmath5 .",
    "given an initial pure state , one can obtain the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath3 performing a partial trace over the degrees of freedom of subsystem @xmath4 ; the function @xmath5 measures how  pure \" is the reduced state , i.e. its  distance \" from a completely mixed state .",
    "the more entangled is the initial pure state , the smaller is the value of this purity . by definition ,",
    "a maximally entangled ( pure ) state will be left in a completely mixed state after the partial trace .    on the other hand ,",
    "multipartite entanglement is less understood and more elusive even if widely investigated  @xcite .",
    "these difficulties are deeply rooted both in the exponentially ( with the system size ) large number of measurements needed for its complete characterization and in new phenomena emerging from the complex interactions among the parties .",
    "obviuosly , the choice of a particular measure , the dimension of the hilbert space of local parties , and the simmetries imposed on quantum states will have an influence on the result .",
    "a natural question is whether it is possible to find maximally entangled states in the multipartite scenario .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite gisin _",
    "_ characterize pure and symmetric maximally entangled state of @xmath0 qubits ( i.e. an ensemble of @xmath0 two - level systems ) as the states such that all their partial traces are maximally mixed .",
    "the idea of characterizing _",
    "multipartite maximally entangled states _ ( mmes ) minimizing their average purity over different bipartitions of the system has been put forward in  @xcite where these states have been obtained as solutions of an optimization problem where the cost function is a proper average of purities , the _ potential of multipartite entanglement _ : @xmath6 here @xmath7 denotes the number of terms in the summation , which can be restricted to a certain subset of partitions ( in this paper we will consider the number of balanced bipartitions , see definition  [ def : pime ] ) . it is interesting to notice that these states have been analyzed in different contexts . for instance , studies have been devoted to their connections with quantum secret sharing  @xcite and combinatorial designs  @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent analysis have focussed the attention on the so - called @xmath8-uniform states and their link to orthogonal arrays  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , beside an interesting topic _ per se _ , the study of mmes is important because of new intriguing phenomena arising in the multipartite scenario . a peculiar property of multipartite entanglement , the so - called _ entanglement frustration _",
    "@xcite naturally appears when one tries to minimize the purity of all possible bipartitions at the same time .",
    "this subject has been explored because of its connection with self - dual codes  @xcite and it has been possible to prove theorems that ensures the _ impossibility _ to reach the ideal minimum value of purity for all bipartitions for collections of @xmath9 qubits @xcite and even in the relatively simple case of @xmath10  @xcite .    a possible approach to tackle this problem has been introduced for qubits in  @xcite . in particular , this approach is based on methods from classical statistical mechanics .",
    "one introduces a hamiltonian representing the potential of multipartite entanglement @xmath11}^{-1}\\sum_{|a|=n_a/2}\\pi_a=\\sum_{k , k',l , l'\\in\\z_2^n}\\d(k , k';l , l')z_kz_{k'}\\bar{z}_l\\bar{z}_{l'}.\\ ] ] for a normalized pure state written in the computational basis in terms of its fourier coefficients @xmath12 @xmath13 with _ coupling function _",
    "@xmath14 ( see theorem  [ thm : delta ] for its complete general expression ) .",
    "by introducing the partition function @xmath15 with @xmath16 a lagrange multiplier and @xmath17 the unitarily invariant measure over pure states on the hypersphere @xmath18 induced by the haar measure over the unitary group @xmath19  @xcite : @xmath20 one can explore the configurations for @xmath21 where frustration appears and only mmes are sampled .",
    "for qubits it has been possible to use an high - temperature expansion techniques and a diagrammatic evaluation of cumulants of a probability density function . in principle",
    ", one should try to perform the re - summation of all diagrams . on the other hand ,",
    "it is interesting to analyze the different contribution and , using a well motivated criterion , choose a sub - class of diagrams .",
    "obviously the choice should be a possible approach for characterizing the properties of the entanglement .",
    "unfortunately , the calculations are far from being simple and only a few number of cumulants are analytically known . in particular , the topology of diagrams is highly non - trivial and both analytical and numerical hints suggest that the presence of frustration could be related to a precise class of graphs appearing in the cumulant expansion .",
    "one would like to find an objective procedure , if admissible , for discarding some graphs and resumming only a subset of them .",
    "obviously , we would like to have a criterion for choosing which diagrams to maintain not only based on simplicity . a possible way to circumvent",
    "this computational difficulty has been introduced in  @xcite where the selection of graphs has been based on introducing a _ color _ index @xmath22 and considering a field theory for the multipartite entanglement .",
    "an explicit calculation at leading order in @xmath22 has given hints about the presence of a phase transition and it has been possible to numerically observe that the limit of large values of the parameter @xmath22 removes the frustration . on the other hand , it is difficult to give a direct physical interpretation to this approach , though appealing from the mathematical point of view .    following these motivations in this paper",
    "we want to explore another limit .",
    "in particular , after introducing a generalization of the previously sketched framework to a collection of @xmath1-level systems with @xmath23 , we want to study and characterize the behavior of the potential of multipartite entanglement in the limit of large values of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we will find an explicit expression of the coupling function @xmath24 , which generalizes the one obtained for qubits , and study its symmetries .",
    "then we will examine the high - temperature expansion of the distribution function of the potential of multipartite entanglement , proving that the series characterizing the expansion converges and observe that when @xmath1 is large enough only a specific class of perturbative diagram gives a contribution to the partition function .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : multipartiteentanglement ] we introduce the notation and give a detailed description of the problem . in section  [ sec : main ] we define and analyze the function we want to minimize , introduce the statistical mechanics approach and give the main results of the paper . in section  [ sec : diagrammatic ] we introduce the diagrammatic technique used for the analysis of the cumulants",
    ". finally , using this diagrammatics , in section  [ sec : hightemp ] we give the proof of theorem  [ thm : cactus ] .",
    "we add two appendices . in appendix",
    "[ app : sstate ] we exhibit numerical results about a state that , to the best of our knowledge , reaches the lowest value of the @xmath25-qubit potential of multipartite entanglement . in appendix",
    "[ app : codth ] we include for self - consistency some results about the relation between perfect mmes and maximum distance separable codes .",
    "let us consider a collection of @xmath0 @xmath1-dimensional quantum systems described by an @xmath26-dimensional hilbert space @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) and separate them into two disjoint sets of , respectively , @xmath29 and @xmath30 elementary systems ( @xmath31 ) , thus defining a bipartition .",
    "a _ bipartition _ of a system @xmath32 of @xmath0 parties is a pair @xmath33 such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the dimensions of the two subsystems then the bipartition is called _ balanced _ if @xmath38\\quad \\mathrm{and } \\quad n_{\\bar{a}}=\\left[\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath39 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath40 ( greatest integer less than @xmath40 ) .    notice",
    "that in the definition it is assumed , without loss of generality , that @xmath41 ; indeed , the bipartitions @xmath33 and @xmath42 will play the same role in our considerations .",
    "with this definition we can consider the hilbert space @xmath43 as a tensor product @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 with dimensions , respectively , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "every normalized vector @xmath49 , representing a pure state of the system , admits a fourier expansion in terms of the orthonormal computational basis @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the cyclic group with @xmath1 elements .",
    "indeed , there is a natural correspondence between the basis of the space and the strings of length @xmath0 over @xmath1 symbols .",
    "a convenient measure of bipartite entanglement is the so - called _ purity ( of the reduced state ) _ : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the reduced density matrix of the subsystem @xmath3 , with @xmath57 denoting the partial trace over subsystem @xmath4 , and @xmath58 s are the eigenvalues of @xmath59 . since for the rest of this work we will consider only the purity of the relevant subsystem , we will refer to this quantity simply as purity .    using this expansion , we can rewrite the purity as : @xmath60 where we used the symbol @xmath61 to indicate the substring of @xmath8 belonging to @xmath3 , and where @xmath62 is the kronecker delta .    in the following",
    "we will need this lemma , of immediate proof :    [ prop : bound ] given a state @xmath63 of @xmath0 qudits and a bipartition @xmath33 , the following holds    1 .",

    "@xmath65 ,    where @xmath66 , with @xmath67 .",
    "moreover the upper bound is reached only by separable states .      in this section",
    "we will deeply extend the use of purity for the characterization of the _ multipartite _ entanglement of a generic system of @xmath0 parties .",
    "in general , a system composed by @xmath68 parties has a number of different bipartitions that scales as @xmath69 .",
    "the states that saturate the lower bound of the purity for some bipartitions are called _ maximally entangled _ with respect to these bipartitions .",
    "the bell states are examples of maximally entangled states ( here there is no need to specify the bipartition since it is unique in systems with only two components ) .    a state @xmath70 such that @xmath71 with respect to every bipartition @xmath33 , i.e. maximally entangled with respect to every bipartition of the system is called a",

    "therefore , the problem of finding perfect mmess can be tackled by studying the average purity over all the balanced bipartitions .    [",

    "@xmath79 ( qubits ) it is possible to obtain an explicit expression of @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "we will extend this result for states of qudits .",
    "let us recall that , using the fourier expansion of the state , we can write the purity of a pure state , with respect to a given bipartition as  : @xmath81 if we average the purity over all the possible bipartitions with fixed dimension , we can define a",

    "if the alphabet is binary , i.e. it is @xmath86 , then the hamming weight is nothing but the number of @xmath87 in the string .",

    "furthermore , since @xmath35 and @xmath34 then @xmath112 and @xmath113 , we can conclude that their number is equal to the binomial coefficient @xmath114 the same result can be obtained for the second term in the sum : @xmath115 swapping the role of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and this ends the proof .",

    "let us stress , once again , that the difference between a mmes and a perfect mmes lies in the saturation of the lower bound of the potential of multipartite entanglement .",
    "the qubit ghz state , i.e. the state @xmath124 , is a perfect mmes , indeed it is easy to show that the purities with respect to all the possible bipartitions are @xmath125 .",
    "one of the questions that arises naturally from the previous discussion is on the general structure of a perfect mmes for given values of @xmath1 ( the dimension of each subsystem ) and @xmath0 ( the number of subsystems ) .    with an abuse of notation we can say that the bell states are perfect mmes for systems of two qubits while for @xmath126 qubits the only perfect mmes , up to local and unitary transformations ,",

    "in this section we want to go briefly throughout the main results of this paper , before going into the details of the proofs .",
    "we recall that ,   @xmath133 due to its form , it is invariant under the permutation of the qudits and under some swaps of the computational basis elements ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "it is well known that applying local unitary transformations to the system does not change its entanglement , and as a consequence the local purity of any of its subsystem : @xmath135 for all @xmath136 , for all @xmath137 and for all @xmath138 , with @xmath139 being the unitary group of degree @xmath1 . moreover ,",
    "if we permute the order of the qudits the global entanglement of the system is left invariant .",
    "the permutation group @xmath140 of order @xmath0 acts on @xmath43 through ( unitary ) swap operators @xmath141 : @xmath142 for all @xmath138 and for all @xmath143 we get that @xmath144 therefore , the potential of multipartite entanglement  ( [ eq : pime ] ) admits the semidirect product @xmath145 as symmetry group , whose product is easily seen to satisfy @xmath146    as a consequence , for the symmetries of the coupling function @xmath14 , we have the following :    [ thm : symmetry ] the coupling function @xmath14 in   is invariant under the action of the semidirect product group @xmath147 whose action on @xmath134 is given by @xmath148 where @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 .",
    "the proof is straightforward after observing that all the operations that characterize the coupling function act position - wise and the permutations are bijective maps .",
    "the minimization problem of the potential of multipartite entanglement can be handled following a statistical mechanics approach  @xcite . roughly speaking we will consider the free energy of a suitable classical system at a fictitious temperature and we will recover the original problem in the zero temperature limit .",
    "considered the state @xmath152 with @xmath153 the vector of the fourier coefficients in the expansion of the state , @xmath154 , we define the hamiltonian @xmath155    let us consider @xmath156 vectors and the ensemble @xmath157 of the number of vectors with fixed potential of multipartite entanglement , @xmath158 .",
    "we want to find the distribution that maximizes the quantity @xmath159 under the constraints @xmath160 and @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the average value of @xmath80 .",

    "here @xmath16 plays the role of an inverse temperature , so that for @xmath169 only the configurations that minimize the hamiltonian survive .",
    "in other words , we recover the mmes in the limit @xmath169 . moreover ,",

    "indeed , we can prove that it is majorized term by term by an absolutely convergent series :    1 .",
