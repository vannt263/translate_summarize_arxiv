    "modified theories of gravity have become one of the most popular candidates for explaining the current accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "as it is well - known , general relativity ( gr ) in its standard form ( without a cosmological constant ) can not explain such cosmological speed - up , without the introduction of extra terms in the gravitational lagrangian ( for reviews on modified theories of gravity , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) or exotic fluid components ( see refs .",
    "geometrical modifications of the standard gravitational lagrangian usually include a wide number of curvature invariants ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , .. ) @xcite that might imply non - minimal couplings between matter and geometry ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the simplest and most studied modification of gr is one where the hilbert - einstein action is generalised to a arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath5 - these are the so - called @xmath0 theories of gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these theories are able to mimic the behaviour of the cosmological constant ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) and reproduce the entire background cosmological history ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . despite these successes ,",
    "@xmath0 theories have their own shortcomings @xcite and specific models have to pass rigorous theoretical and observational scrutiny before they can be accepted as viable alternatives to the concordance model @xcite .    in the last few years",
    ", modified theories of gravity have been shown not only able to mimic the dark energy epoch , but also seem capable of providing a description of the inflationary era @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the use of cosmological observations , such as supernovae type ia or baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) among others , which depend solely upon the expansion history of the universe is not enough to only determine the nature and the origin of dark energy , due to the fact that identical evolutions for the cosmological background can be explained by a diverse number of theories .",
    "this is the so - called _",
    "degeneracy problem_. in order to test the validity of extended theories of gravity , it is therefore necessary to correctly describe the growth rate and matter power spectra as obtained from scalar perturbations ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for analytical techniques and refs . @xcite for numerical parameterisations with several codes ) and the existence and stability of astrophysical objects such as black holes @xcite . another powerful tool to discriminate between competitive theories of gravity",
    "consists in studying both the temperature and the polarisation modes in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectra . since those spectra are made of contributions from both scalar and tensor perturbations , potential signatures from cmb spectra obtained from extended theories are expected .",
    "the study of the effect of tensor ( gravitational wave ) perturbations on the cmb in modified gravity has not received much attention in comparison with their scalar counterpart , where the focus has been on the study of the evolution of the density contrast in these theories @xcite .",
    "this is due to the difficulties modifying the standard cmb codes available for general relativity , such as camb @xcite or cmb - easy @xcite ( originally based on cmbfast @xcite ) .",
    "a number of different attempts to study cmb tensor anisotropies have been made for several modified gravity scenarios .",
    "for instance , the contribution made by cosmic strings in an abelian higgs model to the temperature power spectrum of the cmb was studied in @xcite .",
    "calculations in this paper were performed in a modified version of cmb - easy and were able to constrain the string tension when normalised with the wmap data available at that time .",
    "a number of predictions in the cmb spectrum for this model were presented in @xcite .",
    "also , in the last few years , some attention has been devoted to the study of cmb tensor perturbations in brane - world theories .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the evolution of cosmological tensor perturbations in the randall - sundrum ii model was discussed . in the near - brane limit , the separation of the wave equations becomes possible , making the study of the evolution of perturbations feasible . other work @xcite focused on extending the camb code @xcite to compute cmb tensor anisotropies generated in a generalised @xmath7 randall - sundrum ii braneworld model .",
    "finally , with regard to @xmath0 fourth - order gravity theories , the only existing attempt to encapsulate the main features of tensor perturbations was presented in @xcite . here",
    "the authors analysed tensor perturbations of flat thick domain wall branes in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "they showed that under the transverse and traceless gauge , the metric perturbations decoupled from perturbations of the background scalar field , which generates the brane .",
    "the leitmotiv of this investigation is to address for the first time in literature a detailed analysis of the effect of tensor perturbations on the cmb in a class of metric @xmath0 gravity theories , when studied in the so - called jordan frame .",
    "this provides a further way of determining whether such models are viable , particularly in situations where the background evolution is close to that of the standard @xmath3cdm model .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section [ generalities ] we present the general features of @xmath0 theories and introduce the different fluids that play a role in the cosmological evolution . in section [",
    "dynamics of f(r ) theories ] we introduce the background and tensor perturbation dynamics for these theories , paying special attention to the initial conditions set in the radiation dominated era .",
    "section [ rn_models ] is then devoted to illustrating the formalism for a simple class of one - parameter @xmath0 models by obtaining both the cosmological evolution and the cmb features resulting from tensor perturbations .",
    "section [ results ] then summarises the main results we obtain once the simulations were implemented .",
    "we conclude by giving our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] . at the end of the paper we have included an appendix with specific details on the relevant camb modifications .",

    "these equations obviously reduce to the standard einstein field equations when @xmath15 .",

    "the linearisation of the exact propagation and constraint equations around this background for a pure tensor perturbations then leads to the system @xcite : @xmath44 together with the linearised conservation equations , @xmath45 that are obtained from the bianchi identities contracted twice , where @xmath46 is the effective dark energy equation of state and @xmath47 is the equation of state of standard matter .",

    ", we were able to generate the correct background evolution in camb ( see appendix [ sec : appendix ] for further details on the relevant camb modifications ) .",
    "this procedure was usually missing in previous investigations which , for the sake of simplicity , simply assumed a @xmath3cdm background when studying cmb anisotropies of modified gravity theories .",
    "once the concomitant modifications in the background and perturbation equations have been implemented within the camb package , we consider different values of @xmath75 to study the signatures of modified gravity in the cmb tensor power spectrum .",
    "in particular , we consider the values @xmath85 .",
    "this choice of @xmath75 values is motivated by the fact that the best fit @xmath75 value for @xmath64 models to bao data was obtained for @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "in general , we expect distinct features of modified gravity depending on the particular value of @xmath75 on both the @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 coefficients to be visible when compared to the standard @xmath3cdm results .    in the following , we are interested in features that arise from modifying the background dynamics and those emanating from modifying the perturbation equations . to this end , we compute the power spectra for the four following combinations of background and perturbations , namely    * @xmath0 background with @xmath0 perturbations , * @xmath0 background with @xmath3cdm perturbations , * @xmath3cdm background with @xmath0 perturbations , and * @xmath3cdm background with @xmath3cdm perturbations .    for @xmath0 able to mimic the evolution history of @xmath3cdm models , we expect variations in the main features of the power spectra , with respect to @xmath3cdm results , to arise from modifications of the perturbation equations .",

    "we note from figure [ n_129 ] that cases * b ) * and * d ) * above are almost indistinguishable , owing to the fact that the @xmath90 model resembles the expansion history of the @xmath3cdm background as shown in @xcite .",
    "however , this is not a generic feature of @xmath0 models since most of them usually differ from @xmath3cdm at the background level . for these models",
    "it turns out to be crucial that one implements the @xmath0 perturbations on the corresponding @xmath0 background . for example , in the case @xmath91 , the spectra for cases * b ) * and * d ) * are now clearly distinguishable as can be seen in figure [ n_130 ] .    more insight on the role of background dynamics and the @xmath0 corrections to the perturbations can be obtained by studying the combinations * b ) * and * c ) * above as a function of the parameter @xmath75 . to study the effect of background dynamics , we look at the evolution of @xmath3cdm perturbations on an @xmath0 background for the different values of @xmath75 .",

    "we observe a drop in power by almost an order of magnitude from @xmath92 to @xmath93 for both the @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 spectra .",
    "as expected , the effect of the @xmath0 background is to suppress power on large @xmath97 .",
    "this effect can be attributed to the damping of modes by the background expansion .",
    "it is noteworthy that in the models considered here , the hubble parameter increases more rapidly with increasing values of @xmath75 .",
    "accordingly , the suppression increases with increasing values of the parameter @xmath75 .",
    "this phenomenon clearly demonstrates the need for the correct background model to be implemented in studying anisotropies in modified gravity theories .",
    "the effects of @xmath0 corrections on the perturbations can be isolated by considering the combination of a @xmath3cdm background with @xmath0 perturbations .",
    "this is shown in figure [ grfr_all_n ] .",
    "unlike in the background case , the @xmath0 contributions to the tensor anisotropies act in a way to boost power at large @xmath97 .",
    "this phenomenon is not surprising , considering the form of the curvature fluid contribution to the tensor anisotropies .",
    "we note from that the @xmath0 corrections to the tensor anisotropies depend on the value of @xmath75 through the factor @xmath98 and also through the ratio @xmath99 .",
    "when considering @xmath0 perturbations on a @xmath3cdm background , the ratio @xmath99 remains the same for all @xmath0 models and is independent of @xmath75 . in this case , the @xmath0 corrections are proportional only to @xmath98 and become more pronounced with increasing values of @xmath75 .",
    "interestingly , the features in the power spectra coming from the @xmath0 perturbations  on a @xmath3cdm background  are not as pronounced as those coming from the @xmath0 background  with @xmath3cdm perturbations  for both the @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 spectra . as a result ,",
    "one is likely to underestimate the overall effects of @xmath0 corrections when considering a @xmath3cdm background .",
    "in addition to issues of power amplitude , there is an overall negative phase shift in the oscillations of the power spectra at sub - horizon scales .",
    "this aspect of the @xmath0 corrections is most notable in figure [ frgr_all_n ] for all the studied spectra .",
    "since figure [ frgr_all_n ] considers @xmath0 backgrounds , we attribute the phase shift to background dynamics .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that for low @xmath97 , a similar shift is observed when an @xmath0 background is employed for the @xmath95 and @xmath96 spectra in figures [ n_129 ] and [ n_130 ] .",

    "in this work we have presented for the first time a detailed analysis of the tensor cmb features for a simple one parameter class of @xmath0 modified gravity theories by using a new implementation of camb .",
    "these simulations used both the correct cosmological background evolution as provided by these fourth - order gravity theories as well as the required tensor perturbation equations .",
    "we applied our general results to @xmath64 models for different values of @xmath75 verifying the convergence to general relativity result when @xmath75 approaches unity and describing the features that may distinguish those models from concordance @xmath3cdm model predictions .",

    "by only considering perturbations for the @xmath100 , having assumed the usual general relativity background expansion history , would lead for instance to not seeing any appreciable difference between pure general relativity and the @xmath90 cases for all the depicted spectra .",

    "one particularly interesting feature of tensor modes in these theories is the appearance of an amplification in the @xmath4-modes power spectrum , in particular around the peak at @xmath105 , due to the different evolution of tensor perturbations .",
    "figures ( [ n_129 ] ) and ( [ n_130 ] ) may help to visualise this statement .",
    "this enhancement would clearly favour the detectability of primordial gravitational waves in these models compared to general relativity .",
    "consequently inflationary models occurring on lower energy scales when combined with the models under consideration in this investigation would present the same @xmath4-mode amplitude as if the tensor perturbations had been evolving as in @xmath3cdm model for commonly accepted inflationary scales .",
    "this means that these theories present a degeneracy between the model parameters and the inflationary scale . in other words ,",
    "the assumption that the detection of @xmath4-modes directly fixes the scale of inflation should be cautiously reconsidered until one better understands how combined effects coming from gravitational theories beyond general relativity , together with the modification of the inflationary scale may have on the amplitude of the @xmath4-modes .",
    "the tests described in this paper can be applied in order to further constrain the allowed range of parameters for classes of @xmath0 models that provide an alternative explanation for the late - time cosmological speed - up .",
    "in particular , for models mimicking general relativity at high redshift , the formalism presented here can be directly applied , since equation ( [ ic2 ] ) will be immediately satisfied .",

    "for example , in order to control the convergence of integrations within the ` rombint2 ( ) ` function ( found in ` subroutines.f90 ` ) , we have had to increase the number of maximum iterations maxiter . moreover , since our models are spatially flat , one has to be careful that the input cosmological parameters are consistent with flat geometry to the required accuracy as given by @xmath123 in ` modules.f90 ` .",
