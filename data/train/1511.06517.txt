    "<S> sc and sdw orders are supposed to coexist , so @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 satisfy the constraint @xmath63 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main conclusion is independent of these assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> there are three main results , to be explained one by one below .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we consider the fate of the associated phase transitions . after solving the rg equations </S>",
    "<S> , we show the @xmath58-dependence of various parameters in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_runaway_gm_t ] . </S>",
    "<S> the quadratic coupling parameters @xmath30 , @xmath29 , and @xmath32 all flow to infinity eventually as @xmath64 , thus the system does not approach any stable fixed point in the low energy region . as discussed in previous works </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this results is usually regarded as a signature of an instability towards first - order transitions since a second - order transition is always associated with the presence of a stable infrared fixed point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_runaway_gm_t ] that the parameters @xmath30 , @xmath29 , and @xmath32 increase with growing @xmath58 very slowly for small values of @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> their magnitudes become large only when @xmath58 grows beyond certain threshold . therefore , before running to large values , the rg results of the @xmath58-dependence of these parameters are still reliable and give us very useful information about the physical properties of the system @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we address the impact of the ordering competition on the nematic transition line . </S>",
    "<S> a number of experiments have observed an interesting transition from an orthorhombic structure to a tetragonal structure at low @xmath0 in the sc dome of @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath65 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the nematic order exists in an intermediate range of @xmath0 and disappears once @xmath0 is lower than certain value . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this unusual behavior can be naturally obtained in our rg analysis . to demonstrate this , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the property of parameter @xmath31 , whose sign determines whether the nematic order is present . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath66 , only one of the two order parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 develops a finite mean value @xcite due to tetragonal symmetry breaking . in this case , the nematic order is present . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath69 if @xmath70 , which indicates that the nematic order is absent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to judge whether the nematic order exists at certain @xmath0 , we need to compute the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath31 from the rg results .    the detailed @xmath58-dependence of @xmath31 is depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_runaway_gm_t ] . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath58 grows , @xmath31 first increases steadily , but decreases rapidly for large values of @xmath58 and becomes negative at certain critical value @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath71 is also the length scale at which @xmath30 , @xmath29 , and @xmath32 diverge . </S>",
    "<S> we can translate the @xmath58-dependence of @xmath31 to a @xmath0-dependence by using the transformation @xcite @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_runaway_gm_t ] clearly shows that the positive @xmath31 becomes negative as @xmath0 decreases immediately below temperature @xmath73 , which means the nematic order is entirely suppressed at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the nematic order can only exist in the intermediate range between @xmath74 and its transition temperature @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> it is destroyed by the thermal fluctuation at @xmath76 , and by the strong competition among superconductivity , sdw , and nematic order at @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath75 is supposed to be always higher than @xmath13 @xcite , this behavior gives rise to a back - bending effect of the nematic transition line on the phase diagram shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_coexist ] , which is consistent with the observed reentrance of tetragonal structure at low temperatures @xcite .    to acquire a better knowledge of the phase diagram </S>",
    "<S> , we also wish to know how the nematic transition line varies with @xmath0 as we move away from the sdw qcp . in the doping region @xmath78 , the sdw order parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> develop finite mean values . </S>",
    "<S> we here only present the main results ( see supplemental material @xcite for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_g_m_ii ] shows the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath31 for different values of bare parameter @xmath79 . for the chosen values of @xmath79 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath31 always first grows with decreasing @xmath0 and then becomes negative once @xmath0 is below certain threshold , which means the nematic order is suppressed at low @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the temperature scale at which @xmath31 changes sign increases as @xmath79 grows . in principle , the quantity @xmath80 , given by the sc transition temperature , also varies as @xmath79 grows . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite this complexity , one can conclude from our rg results that the nematic transition line can not intersect with the horizontal axis of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_coexist ] , but should instead merge somewhere with the sc transition line . </S>",
    "<S> this property leads to a considerable modification of the global phase diagram , as visualized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_coexist ] . according to our results , </S>",
    "<S> the reentrance of tetragonal phase occur in a wide range of doping @xmath16 .    finally , we turn to the @xmath0-dependence of superfluid density @xmath5 . within the effective model given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq_effective_l ] ) , the superfluid density @xmath81 . to obtain the @xmath0-dependent @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> , we also utilize the transformation @xmath83 , where a suitable choice of @xmath80 is the sc temperature @xmath84 . at first glance , </S>",
    "<S> the rg results seem to suggest that @xmath85 diverges rapidly at @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> however , because the transitions become first order , the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath14 is reliable only at @xmath86 . here </S>",
    "<S> , we choose the value @xmath87 with @xmath88 being a little higher than @xmath74 to re - scale @xmath14 , and then show @xmath89 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_denisty_l ] , where the initial values are the same as those adopted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_runaway_gm_t ] . </S>",
    "<S> an obvious conclusion is that the ordering competition leads to a strong @xmath0-dependence of @xmath5 , which decreases very rapidly as @xmath0 grows . for finite @xmath79 , </S>",
    "<S> the behaviors of @xmath14 are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_density_ii ] . as @xmath79 increases , </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of @xmath14 becomes weaker . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath11 sensitively depends on the superfluid density , we can infer that @xmath11 should be suppressed to some extent in the region @xmath78 and that this effect is most significant at @xmath41 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_coexist ] .    </S>",
    "<S> hashimoto _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has measured the superfluid density @xmath14 in a number of superconductors , including iron pnictides and heavy fermion compounds , and claimed to unveil a universal @xmath90 behavior over a wide range of temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior was argued @xcite to be caused by the coupling between magnetic fluctuation and fermionic excitations . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis has clearly showed that ordering competition alone can not account for the @xmath90 behavior . as depicted in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_denisty_l ] , only in a very restricted region of @xmath0 could we extract an approximate @xmath91 behavior . on the other hand , we can see from the main panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_denisty_l ] that , ordering competition does make a significant contribution to @xmath14 and hence can not be simply neglected . </S>",
    "<S> bearing these two points in mind , we believe that both ordering competition and fermionic excitations need to be properly incorporated in a more refined model of @xmath14 .    in summary , we have studied the impact of the strong competition among superconductivity , sdw order , and nematic order on the global phase diagram of iron pnictides by performing a systematic rg analysis within an effective field theory . </S>",
