    "the team would make the best decision if the physicians could share every result and discuss how to treat the patient",
    ". this would be as if the agents send their observations in full to a fusion center , which is able to use a sophisticated integration rule , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : team1 ] . however , this level of communication costs a lot of time and resources , and this architecture assumes the ability to jointly interpret the totality of information .    a more common way to aggregate opinions of human decision makers",
    "is through some form of voting .",
    "in fact , a patient may seek the opinions of three physicians and decide according to the majority , with no interaction among the physicians , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : team2 ] .",
    "this is a typical distributed detection model .",
    "the optimal local decision - making strategy in such model has been studied for decades  @xcite .    in some settings",
    ", people share their opinions and thus can affect the opinions of others . in the medical example , the patient may see the physicians in sequence , and the recommendation ( medication or surgery ) of a physician may be known to each later - consulted physician when she is making her own recommendation .",

    "the effect of this interaction among decision - making agents  under certain assumptions that are adopted for tractability  is the focus of this paper .    in our model",
    ", agents make decisions in a predetermined order and later - acting agents can observe all or some of the decisions made by earlier - acting agents .",
    "the local decisions are also called _ public signals _ because they are shown to multiple agents , unlike the _ private signals_. the later - acting agents can perform bayesian reasoning to learn some information from the public signals and make better local decisions .",
    "this process of incorporating information from other agents is called _",
    "social learning_. we will see that social learning provides no improvement when the agents have conditionally independent and identically distributed ( iid ) private signals ; otherwise there is generally an improvement , and the degree of improvement depends on the order in which the agents make their decisions .      mathematical study of social learning was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "these papers discussed decision - making agents who make decisions in a predetermined order and for individually maximizing their own utilities .",
    "they presented models where choices made by all agents are observed by all other agents as public signals . in these models ,",
    "herding behavior  that agents ignore private signals and adopt public signals  arises after several earlier - acting agents choose the same alternative .",
    "it was later shown that incorrect herding occurs with a nonzero probability if the private signals are boundedly informative .",
    "generated under a state @xmath0 is called _ boundedly informative _ if there exists @xmath1 such that @xmath2 for all @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "] otherwise , asymptotically a sequence of agents will converge to the correct choice  @xcite .",
    "this work is unique from previous works in that we study social learning in a team decision - making scenario with a symmetric fusion of the local decisions .",
    "the fusion by voting makes an earlier - acting agent important not only because she influences later - acting agents but also because her vote counts in the fusion rule .",
    "we ask whether it is beneficial for the agents to share their local decisions among themselves .",
    "the agents in this work perform bayesian reasoning , and there is a rich literature that suggests this to be a good approximation to human behavior  @xcite .",
    "note that we consider agents who share a common goal .",
    "the social learning in previous works occurs among agents that have individual goals and behave selfishly to achieve their own goals .",
    "social learning is helpful in this case if the private signals are unbounded  @xcite even though the selfishness diminishes the efficiency of social learning  @xcite .",
    "et al_.  @xcite also state that social learning yields a lower rate of learning than collaboration does .",
    "they compare social learning by selfish agents to distributed detection by collaborating agents but do not consider social learning by collaborating agents .",
    "in contrast , we are considering social learning and distributed detection together in one model .    when the agents private signals are not conditionally iid , we find that the order in which the agents make their decisions can affect the collective performance .",
    "the ordering that maximizes the amount of information transferred to the fusion center was studied previously in the case when agents observe binary private signals by ottaviani and srenson  @xcite .",
    "they state that for a given group of heterogeneous expert agents , the order in which the agents speak matters . the same statement holds in our model even though the agents in our model have a different motivation than the agents in the previous model , who pursue only the personal goal of improving their reputations .",
    "the importance of ordering is also pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "our preliminary work  @xcite compares private voting to public voting in which all agents observe the full history of previous decisions and the agents observe conditionally iid private signals .",
    "it is shown that public voting does not improve performance .",
    "intuitively , one might think that social learning helps later - acting agents make better local decisions , leading to improvement of the team decision ; however , this intuition is shown to be wrong .",
    "this paper builds upon the preliminary results in  @xcite .",
    "we extend our interest to more general models .",
    "we allow the likelihoods for the agents private signals to differ . also , agents may observe only some of previous decisions , such as a decision made by the agent just before themselves in a sequence  @xcite or local decisions made by their neighbors in a specific network  @xcite .",
    "all discussions in this paper do not require that private signals are equal to the hypothesis corrupted by additive or gaussian noises .",
    "agents observe private signals with likelihood functions that are different under state 0 and state 1 .",
    "all we need is that their likelihood ratios are strictly monotonic , which is a rather natural requirement .",

    "they use one decision threshold each .    on the other hand , in public voting alexis",
    "first makes a decision and then britta makes a decision upon observing alexis s decision . as always , alexis has a single decision threshold .",
    "britta also has only one relevant decision threshold , like in secret voting .",
    "while britta seems to be able to choose two decision thresholds , one for @xmath43 and another for @xmath44 , for each fusion rule there is one value of the public signal for which her decision becomes irrelevant to the team decision : under the or rule , when @xmath44 the team decision is @xmath24 regardless of britta s local decision ; and under the and rule , when @xmath43 the team decision is @xmath27 regardless of britta s local decision .",
    "thus , both agents equally have one degree of freedom even when the voting is public .",

    "their optimal decision thresholds @xmath65 and @xmath66 minimize .    in the public voting scenario ,",

    "while the precise expressions for @xmath76 and @xmath77 change , again we find that the achievable set of local type  i and type  ii error probabilities are identical under secret and public voting , so the minima and optimum decision thresholds are unaffected by the public signal .    for larger @xmath5",

    "a numerical example is detailed in fig .",
    "[ fig : decthreschange ] .",

    "we now extend our analysis to scenarios in which each agent is aware of an arbitrary subset of the previously made decisions .",
    "for example , each agent may observe the public signal only from its neighbors in a sequence ( see fig .",

    "[ fig : partialpublicvoting2 ] ) .",
    "let us say that agents perform _ partial public voting _ when agents observe proper subsets of precedent local decisions .    observing a subset of public signals does not affect optimal decision rules and performance of a team .",
    "first , we will show that a team of agents observing only a subset of public signals ( team  a ) can not outperform a team of the same size that consists of those who observe full public signals ( team  b ) .",
    "the proof is by contradiction .",
    "let us assume that team  a can outperform team  b using their optimal decision strategy . then , since what each agent in team  a observes is also observed by the corresponding agents in team  b , team  b can mimic the optimal strategy of team  a. for agent @xmath10 in team  b , all she has to do is ignore the public signals that agent @xmath10 in team  a can not observe .",
    "after mimicking the strategy of team  a , the performance of team  b becomes the same as that of team  a. this contradicts our assumption . hence team  a",
    "can not outperform team  b.    next , let us consider team  a and a team of agents not observing any public signals ( team  c ) .",

    ", the agents should ignore the public signals .",
    "since the optimal secret voting strategy performs equally to the optimal public voting strategy , it is economical for them to not share any public signals at all .",
    "agents may have private signals that relate differently to the hypothesis .",
    "as one example , this occurs when we model each agent s private signal as the hypothesis observed over an additive noise channel , and the channels have different snrs .",
    "we could think of the agents with relatively high snrs as _ experts _ and those with low snrs as _",
    "novices_. their decisions are not equally informative , unlike in the identical - agent case of section  [ sec : identicalagents ] .",
    "we will show that the public signals are futile in cases where the fusion rule requires unanimity but useful in other cases .    now that the agents private signals do not have the same distributions , the order in which the agents act matters to their team performance . to distinguish the agents , we name them in descending order of snrs : amy has the highest snr",
    ", beth has the second - highest snr , and so on .",
    "however , we keep the notation that the numbering of agents ( and hence the subscript indices ) indicate the order of decision making , i.e. , agent 1 acts first , but may or may not be amy .",
    "the and ( @xmath5-out - of-@xmath5 ) and or ( @xmath124-out - of-@xmath5 ) rules have a common feature .",
    "the team decision requires unanimity of the agents of one type or the other : for a team decision of 1 under the and rule , the agents must unanimously decide 1 ; and for a team decision of 0 under the or rule , they must unanimously decide 0 .",
    "we thus call these _ unanimity fusion rules_. this characteristic gives a special result for these fusion rules .",
    "let us consider a team of two agents with the or rule : amy with a higher snr and beth with a lower snr . from the discussion of the two - agent case in section  [ sec :",
    "identicalagents ] , both amy and beth have one degree of freedom .",
    "suppose amy makes her decision first with decision threshold @xmath135 , and beth then makes her decision with decision threshold @xmath136 , regardless of amy s decision .",
    "their minimum bayes risk is @xmath137    now suppose that they switch their positions : beth first makes her decision with decision threshold @xmath138 , and amy then makes her decision with decision threshold @xmath139 , regardless of beth s decision .",
    "their minimum bayes risk is now given by @xmath140    the situation is very similar to the proof of theorem  [ thm:2agent ] .",
    "we have two nearly identical expressions , and , and each agent has a single decision threshold to vary .",
    "this leads to identical minima achieved with identical decision thresholds .",
    "specifically , can be rearranged to @xmath141 now the only difference between and is the replacement of @xmath142 in by @xmath143 in .",
    "each of these 4-tuples is the combinations of type  i and type  ii error probabilities for amy and beth as each agent varies a single threshold ; thus , the achievable 4-tuples are identical",
    ". therefore , the optimal decision thresholds are also the same : @xmath144    in conclusion , not only is the public signal useless but also the agents decision - making order does not affect the optimal team decision .",
    "their optimal strategy is just to adopt the decision thresholds @xmath145 and @xmath146 that minimize the bayes risk : @xmath147    we can extend this result to @xmath5 agents as long as the fusion is performed by the or rule or the and rule .    for a unanimity fusion rule ,",
    "secret voting is the optimal strategy even when agents observe private signals with different snrs .",
    "specifically , public signals are useless and the ordering of agents does not affect their optimal decision rules nor the resulting performance .    for the or rule , where the bayes risk is given by @xmath148 each agent has a meaningful decision threshold only if all previous agents declare 0 .",
    "otherwise , decisions of the remaining agents are irrelevant .",
    "thus , without loss of optimality , we can constrain that the agents optimize their decision thresholds @xmath149 for the case when @xmath150 and use the same decision threshold for any public signals .",
    "in fact , they need not know the public signals ; they just need to perform decision making as if all public signals are 0 .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry in implies that indices of agents @xmath151 and @xmath10 are interchangeable .",
    "therefore , the ordering of agents does not affect the optimal values of decision thresholds and , consequently , the minimum bayes risk .",
    "for the and rule , the bayes risk is given by @xmath152 and we can prove the statement in a similar way .    in general , the solution to minimizing   or   does not satisfy @xmath153 , unlike in section  [ sec : identicalagents ] .",
    "agents will use different optimal decision thresholds corresponding to their snrs .",
    "we are arguing not that the agents should have the same decision thresholds but that they should keep their decision thresholds the same in any decision - making position .",
    "furthermore , each agent should make a decision sincerely based on her private signal and should not care about public signals because her vote will count only when all the other agents vote in a particular way ( 0 for the or rule or 1 for the and rule ) .",
    "optimal decision making is more complex for other fusion rules due to the increase of degrees of freedom . even in the simplest case",
    "when three agents make a decision with the majority ( 2-out - of-3 ) rule , the last two agents have two meaningful degrees of freedom each .",
    "the second agent can have different decision thresholds for @xmath43 ( @xmath46 ) and for @xmath44 ( @xmath154 ) , and the last agent can also have different ones for @xmath155 ( @xmath47 ) and for @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) . (",
    "the third agent is irrelevant for @xmath158 or @xmath159 because the team decision has been made without her decision . )",
    "learning from public signals can be helpful in decision making due to these extra degrees of freedom , unlike in section  [ sec : experts - crowd_and / or ] .",
    "our symmetric fusion rule always treats all local decisions with equal weights even though they are made by agents that experience different snrs .",
    "thus , the team decision can be improved by social learning , which inevitably unbalances weights of local decisions .",
    "[ fig : roc_2outof3 ] and  [ fig : roc_2outof4 ] present quantitative evidence of helpful social learning . in these examples ,",

    "[ fig : roc_2outof3 ] , there are three agents using the majority fusion rule .",
    "amy has the highest snr ( @xmath163 ) , beth has the median snr ( @xmath161 ) , and cindy has the lowest snr ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "[ fig : roc_2outof3 ] depicts the optimal reversed receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) curves for all possible orderings of the actions of the three agents .",
    "pairs is achievable .",
    "we call the lower boundary of this set the reversed roc curve . ]",
    "we only need to consider three orderings because the order of the last two agents does not matter as we discussed in section  [ sec : experts - crowd_and / or ] .",
    "the team s updated fusion rule after amy makes a decision will be the and or the or rule , depending on amy s decision .",
    "there are two notable things in fig .",
    "[ fig : roc_2outof3 ] .",
    "first , the reversed roc curve of secret voting is above that of public voting for any ordering .",
    "this implies that public voting strictly outperforms secret voting , regardless of the order in which the agents make decisions .",
    "second , among the public voting scenarios , the best is when beth makes her decision first .",
    "further numerical experiments for @xmath164 with several different noise variances also show that the team performance is the best when the agent with the median snr acts first .",
    "[ fig : roc_2outof4 ] shows the optimal reversed roc curves for four agents and the 2-out - of-4 fusion rule .",
    "again , we need not compare all 16 orderings .",
    "after the first agent makes a decision , the updated fusion rule will be the 1-out - of-3 rule if the decision is 1 , in which case the ordering of the rest of the agents does not matter ( 1-out - of-3 is a unanimity rule ) , and the 2-out - of-3 rule if the decision is 0 , in which case we infer that the agent with median snr should act next .",
    "thus , we only need to compare four orderings , where the first agent is varying and the median of the remaining three becomes the second agent .",
    "[ fig : roc_2outof4 ] shows that the agent with the second - highest snr should act first as well as that public voting always outperforms secret voting .    ) , beth ( @xmath165 ) , cindy ( @xmath166 ) , and daphne ( @xmath167 ) , and the @xmath168-out - of-@xmath169 fusion rule.,width=326 ]    in this section , we have provided evidence that agents can exploit social learning to improve their team decision when the qualities of the private signals vary .",
    "the sequence of the agents also needs to be carefully chosen to achieve the best team performance .",
    "we have discussed the utility of social learning in a distributed detection and fusion system by a team of agents who have the same decision - making costs .",
    "we showed that it is not a trivial question whether intra - team social learning is useful .",
    "the model is intentionally designed to be simple so that we can understand fundamentals : agents have no conflicts of interests and their fusion rule is fixed and symmetric .    when agent  @xmath115 casts a vote @xmath116 as an opinion on the value of the hypothesis @xmath0 , except in degenerate situations , this vote is not independent of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , when the vote is available to other agents as a public signal , it is natural for them update their beliefs about @xmath0 ; this is the basis of the social learning concept .",
    "this paper highlights a countervailing phenomenon that arises when opinions are aggregated by voting : the running tally of previous votes changes the effective fusion rule for the agents who have yet to act .",
    "this fusion rule update is a less frequently explored topic .",
    "when the agents observe conditionally iid private signals , the effects of the belief update and the evolution of the fusion rule cancel exactly .",
    "consequently , the optimal performance with or without public signals is the same ; internally flowing information does not improve the team performance .",
    "when the agents observe signals that are conditionally independent but not identically distributed , the existence of public signals may improve team performance , and when it does , the degree of improvement depends on the order in which the agents act .",
    "we first showed that the @xmath124-out - of-@xmath5 and @xmath5-out - of-@xmath5 fusion rules are peculiar in that they essentially require unanimity among agents : under the @xmath124-out - of-@xmath5 rule , all agents must vote @xmath170 for the team decision to be @xmath170 ; under the @xmath5-out - of-@xmath5 rule , all agents must vote @xmath124 for the team decision to be @xmath124 .",
    "the unanimity rules do not allow a chance for the agents to specialize their decision thresholds for various public signals .",
    "social learning can play a role to improve team decisions as long as the fusion rule is not one of these unanimity rules .    in examples with gaussian likelihoods",
    ", we showed that team performance improves when agents with differing observation snrs do social learning . with three agents making a team decision by the majority fusion rule , it is best for the agent with median snr to act first . with four agents using the 2-out - of-4 fusion rule ,",
    "it is best for the agent with second - best snr to act first .",
    "none of our results show that the existence of public signals makes team performance worse ; logically , if being influenced by public signals would be detrimental , optimal agents would simply ignore them .",
    "we speculate , however , that public signals may be detrimental because , in human agents , belief updates overwhelm the decision rule update .",
    "in fact , without it being explained to them , people may not have intuition for the idea that _ a good agent does not take lightly the disenfranchisement of later - acting agents_.      within the scope of our model , an intriguing open problem is to explain the observed patterns on the optimal order for agents with differing observation snrs to act .",
    "the optimal ordering is nontrivial .",
    "our experimentation with gaussian likelihoods and up to four agents was extensive , but we do not know if the results extend to other likelihoods . are there systematic ordering rules for larger @xmath5 ?",
    "our model has several limitations , such as conditional independence of private signals , knowledge of the prior probability , and the agents having no motivation beyond minimization of the bayes risk ( a team performance criterion ) .",
    "each of these merits further study .",
    "perhaps the most interesting extensions are to the set of fusion rules .",
    "we have assigned an equal weight to each vote in   and hence called the fusion symmetric .",
    "suppose the fusion rule is subject to optimization",
    ". then one could use the chair ",
    "varshney fusion rule  @xcite , which is an algorithm that weights each individual vote according to its quality and accumulates them to compare to an optimally determined threshold .",
    "the effect of social learning in this scenario is an open question .",
    "our focus on equal weighting was motivated by its prevalence in most situations in which human opinions are aggregated by voting , ranging from government elections to juries to decision - making by committees . in human affairs ,",
    "unequal weighting of votes is unusual , except for the extreme cases of veto power and a single ultimate decision maker .    having a single ultimate decision maker changes the situation rather dramatically . with respect to fig .",
