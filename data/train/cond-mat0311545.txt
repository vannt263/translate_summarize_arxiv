    "in recent years , electron transport through molecules sandwiched between metallic electrodes has been attracting increasing attention both for fundamental reasons and because it may form the basis of a future molecular electronics technology.@xcite experimentally , it is difficult to precisely manipulate or even measure the atomic structure of the molecule - electrode contacts",
    ". therefore , neither the influence of atomic structure on transport through the devices nor a path to improved performance is clear . as a result ,",
    "the ability to calculate the atomic and electronic structure as well as the transport properties of electrode - molecule - electrode systems is important and useful in this field .",
    "electron transport through nanoscale molecular devices differs significantly from that through macroscopic semiconductor heterostructures . in the latter ,",
    "the effective - mass approximation is generally successful because of the periodic lattice structure and large electron wavelength .",
    "in contrast , in a molecular device a carrier electron will be scattered by only a few atoms whose particular arrangement , then , matters a great deal .",
    "consequently , the effective - mass approximation breaks down , and the electronic structure of the molecular device must be taken into account explicitly .",
    "for this purpose , methods based on density functional theory ( dft ) are sufficiently accurate and efficient.@xcite conventional dft methods , however , deal with either closed molecular systems ( in quantum chemistry ) or periodic solids ( in solid state physics ) , neither of which is applicable to molecular transport .",
    "thus one needs to develop a dft approach suitable for a system which is open , infinite , non - periodic , and non - equilibrium ( if the bias voltage is nonzero ) .",
    "one way to do this was suggested by lang , _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite by using the jellium model for the two metallic electrodes of an electrode - molecule - electrode system , they mapped the kohn - sham equation of the system into the lippmann - schwinger scattering equation and solved for the scattering states self - consistently .",
    "they then calculated the current by summing up the contributions from all the scattering states , following a landauer - type approach.@xcite in this way , both the conductance and @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics of the system can be investigated .",
    "the use of the jellium model for electrodes is convenient and simple but limited : it can not include the effects of different contact geometries and surface relaxation , for instance .",
    "it also can not deal with directional bonding such as in semiconductors and transition metals . as a result",
    ", the molecule - electrode charge transfer , which is one of the key factors affecting transport , may not be quantitatively correct.@xcite    another way to develop the desired dft approach is to use the non - equilibrium green function ( negf ) method.@xcite the required open and non - equilibrium conditions can be treated rigorously , at least in a formal sense .",
    "this method is also closely related to the landaur approach@xcite and has proven to be powerful for studying electron transport through nanoscale devices .",
    "therefore , by combining the negf method with conventional dft - based electronic structure methods used in quantum chemistry or solid - state physics , the coherent transport properties of an electrode - molecule - electrode system can be determined fully self - consistently from first - principles .",
    "a further advantage of the negf+dft combination is that the atomic structure of the device region and the metallic electrodes are treated explicitly on the same footing .",
    "as has been mentioned , the molecule - electrode interaction will induce charge transfer between them and atomic relaxation of their contact  both have a significant effect on electron transport . as a result ,",
    "the division of the system into the molecule and the electrodes is not meaningful anymore , and some parts of the electrodes must be included into the device region to form an  extended molecule \" .",
    "based on this combined negf+dft method , there are several successful implementations @xcite for molecular conduction and extensive theoretical results in the recent literature .",
    "@xcite according to the way of treating the extended molecule , the semi - infinite leads , and their couplings in a lead - molecule - lead ( lml ) system , these implementations can be roughly divided into two categories .",
    "in one category people adopted a cluster geometry for all the subsystems of a lml system or for the extended molecule with the leads treated by a tight binding approach ( for example , ref . ) .",
    "it is then convenient to employ well - established quantum chemistry code ( like gaussian or dmol ) to do the electronic structure calculation for the subsystem(s ) .",
    "however , there are potential problems with these treatments for strong molecule - lead couplings : in this case it is obviously necessary to included large parts of the leads into the extended molecule so that the strong molecule - lead interaction can be fully accommodated . to eliminate the artificially introduced surface effects an even larger system is needed , which is usually difficult to deal with by a quantum chemistry code .",
    "so in practice only several ( or even only one ) lead atoms are attached to the molecule to form an extended molecule ( for example , ref . ) . in this case ,",
    "significant artificial surface effects are inevitable , the contact atomic relaxation can not be included , and an accurate molecule - lead coupling is not available .",
    "in addition , there may be artificial scattering at the interface between the tight - binding part of the lead and the dft part of the lead ( included in the extended molecule ) .    in the other category ( ref . )",
    ", people adopted periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) ( as in solid state physics ) with large parts of the leads included in the extended molecule , so that the interaction between the molecule and its images will be screened off by the metallic lead in between . in this case all the potential problems mentioned above will be absent and the whole lml system becomes nearly perfect in geometry and all the subsystems are treated exactly on the same footing .",
    "two examples of successful implementations adopting the pbc are the transiesta package @xcite and the mcdcal package.@xcite on the other hand , a drawback is introduced by pbc : when a bias is applied , the hartree potential must jump unphysically between unit cells .",
    "this has previously been addressed by having an independent solution of the poisson equation .    in this paper , we first develop a fully self - consistent negf+dft method with pbc , which has small but important differences from the two previous implementations .",
    "the advantage of our method is that it is simple while still rigorous : the non - equilibrium condition under a bias is fully included in the negf part , and , as a result , we do not need to make changes in the conventional electronic structure part .",
    "so it is straightforward to combine with any electronic structure method that uses a localized basis set . more importantly , in this way the problem of the unphysical jumps in the hartree potential is avoided .",
    "a shortcoming of the full self - consistent ( sc ) negf+dft approach is the large computational effort involved , especially for large systems , large bias voltages , or cases where many bias voltages need to be calculated as for @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics . as a result , a non - self - consistent ( non - sc ) method with much higher efficiency and useful accuracy",
    "is highly desirable . as a step toward this goal",
    ", we also construct an approximate but much more efficient non - sc method in which the change in self - consistent effective potential in the device region caused by a bias is approximated by the main features of the voltage drop .",
    "as an application of our approach , in this paper we do calculations by combining it with a very efficient electronic structure package siesta.@xcite the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves of two systems with different typical voltage drop behaviors  a carbon or aluminum chain sandwiched between two aluminum electrodes  are calculated .",
    "our self - consistent results are in good agreement with those from previous calculations.@xcite by comparison to the self - consistent results , we examine the validity of the non - sc approach , showing that this approach works quite well and can give quantitatively nearly correct answers .",
    "the arrangement of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we give briefly a description of our implementation of the negf+dft method . because the basic formalism of the negf+dft is well established,@xcite we show only those formula useful for introducing the new features of our method . the present sc and non - sc approaches",
    "are explained in section iii .",
    "section iv starts with results for a carbon chain and an aluminum chain sandwiched between two al(001 ) electrodes .",
    "our results are compared with previous results , and we discuss the validity of the non - sc approach by comparison to the self - consistent results . in section",
    "v we summarize and conclude .",

    "we consider only the two - terminal system which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "1 . an important consideration for modeling the real physical system is the charge transfer and atomic relaxation around the two molecule - lead contact regions . as a result",
    ", we have to include some parts of the metallic leads into the device region , forming an extended molecule .",
    "one obvious convergence criteria for the size of the extended molecule is its charge neutrality .",
    "then the charge transfer and the potential disturbance caused by the molecule can be considered screened off outside the extended molecule region . in order to obtain good convergence ,",
    "we actually include a large part of each metallic lead into the @xmath5 region , so that the layers adjacent to @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 parts in fig .",
    "1 ) have bulk properties .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system is : @xmath8 note that , here the leads @xmath2 and @xmath3 interact only through the molecular junction , so their direct interaction term @xmath9 vanishes ( this can always be satisfied by using a localized basis set ) .      when @xmath10 is expanded in a basis set , generally only the matrix of @xmath11 ( denoted @xmath12 )",

    "generally , the supercell of the dft part can be made larger than the size of the region @xmath5 , especially for systems without a translational symmetry , because the dft part is usually much cheaper than the green function part .",
    "for non - zero @xmath4 , care must be taken to account for the effects of the bias voltage on the charge density . one way to proceed",
    "is to apply a constant field in the direction parallel to the leads within the supercell of the dft calculation .",
    "thus a linear drop is added to the external potential in eq .",
    "( [ equ_h ] ) , and the effect on the charge density follows from , for instance , solving the poisson equation .",
    "this approach is not straightforward for periodic boundary conditions because of the artificial potential jumps at the two supercell boundaries in the lead direction .",
    "one way to eliminate the unphysical jumps is to use a larger supercell for the dft calculation and replace the hamiltonian of each of the regions near the potential jumps by the bulk one with a constant potential shift given by the bias voltage ; this is implemented in the transiesta program.@xcite    here we propose a different approach to handle the bias , one which is less obvious but turns out to be simpler in the end : the bias is included through the density matrix ( @xmath76 ) in the green function calculation instead of the potential ( @xmath12 ) in the dft part .",
