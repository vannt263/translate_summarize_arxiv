    "the galaxies ic 2163 and ngc 2207 are undergoing a grazing collision with perigalacticon @xmath3 myr ago @xcite .",
    "the tidal force exerted on ic 2163 by ngc 2207 is prograde and nearly in - plane .",
    "it produces an intrinsically ocular structure ( a cuspy oval ) at mid - radius in ic 2163 and two tidal arms . a narrow ridge along the ocular appears to be a galactic - scale shock front with intense star formation , several super - star clusters including one measuring @xmath4 @xcite , and an ir - to - radio continuum ratio ( @xmath5[8 ] /@xmath6 $ ] ) that is a factor of 2 higher than elsewhere in the galaxies @xcite .",
    "hi observations @xcite reveal photometric and kinematic major axes in ic 2163 that are nearly orthogonal , indicating high speed streaming motions .",
    "the tidal force exerted on ngc 2207 by ic 2163 is mostly perpendicular to ngc 2207 , causing a velocity perturbation in ngc 2207 that is @xmath7 km s@xmath2 in places , and suggesting a warp with 15 kpc vertical distortion @xcite .",
    "both galaxies have large hi velocity dispersions of @xmath8 km s@xmath2 , and several large hi cloud complexes with masses of @xmath9 or more @xcite .",
    "ic 2163 has an hi tidal bridge behind the eastern half of ngc 2207 , and ngc 2207 has an hi spiral arm ( visible also optically ) in front of ic 2163 ( see figures in * ? ? ?",
    "* where the hi contours are overlaid on an hst image ) .",
    "ngc 2207 contains a peculiar region , _",
    "feature i _ , called a mini - starburst by @xcite .",
    "this is the brightest source for either galaxy in radio continuum , 8 , 24  and @xmath10 ; it accounts for one - quarter of the total 24 flux for both galaxies combined . at @xmath11 6 cm , the radio continuum luminosity of _ feature i _",
    "is 13% of the radio continuum luminosity of the central starburst in m82 .",
    "soft x - ray emission was found by @xcite .",
    "we observed ngc 2207/ic 2163 in co(1 - 0 ) with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "the present paper is devoted to determining the spatially - resolved kennicutt - schmidt @xcite relation in this galaxy pair .",
    "we are interested in whether this relation on a scale of @xmath12 kpc diameter differs from that in other galaxies , and whether it is the same in both galaxies here .",
    "we combine the alma co observations with our previous hi , 24 , and @xmath10 data to determine the star formation rate ( sfr ) surface density , @xmath13 , as a function of atomic , molecular , and total gas surface densities .",
    "other properties of these co observations will be discussed in kaufman et al .",
    "( 2016 ) .    in what follows",
    ", section 2 describes the observations , section 3 gives the luminosities , sfrs , and surface densities of the selected regions , section 4 shows the relations between @xmath13 and the gas surface density , and section 5 discusses the implications .",
    "ic 2163 and ngc 2207 were observed in 34 pointings using alma at the @xmath14co(1 - 0 ) frequency of 115.27 ghz ( @xmath11 2.6 mm ) .",
    "we made naturally weighted maps of co emission with a point spread function of @xmath15 ( hpbw ) , beam position angle @xmath16 , and channel width @xmath17 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the rms noise per channel is @xmath18 mjy beam@xmath2 and a co surface brightness of 1 jy beam@xmath2 corresponds to @xmath19 k. to select areas of genuine co emission , we made a blanking mask by convolving this cube to @xmath20 hpbw , where the noise was 7.9 mjy / beam .",
    "regions were left unblanked if they exceeded 2.5 times this rms noise for at least 2 adjacent channels in an area of at least 1 arc sec .",
    "this means that regions with line - of - sight @xmath21 pc@xmath22 were blanked out . after correcting for primary beam attenuation",
    ", we made the @xmath23 pixel @xmath24 channel subcube used in this paper that contains all of the unblanked co emission . in the subcube ,",
    "the product of the rms noise and the channel width is equivalent to a line of sight @xmath25 pc@xmath22 , which is a measure of our uncertainty .",
    "( the apertures a10 , a16 , a33 , a38 , and a39 discussed below have mean values of line - of - sight @xmath26 below this because of blanked pixels . ) the total integrated co line flux in the subcube is @xmath27 jy km s@xmath2 . for more details on the observing procedure ,",
    "see @xcite .    to convert co emission into molecular mass @xmath28 , we use @xmath29 h@xmath30 cm@xmath22 ( k km s@xmath2)@xmath2 from @xcite and a distance @xmath32 mpc from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) for a hubble constant of @xmath33 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 corrected for infall towards virgo .",
    "the scale is 170 pc per arcsec . to convert surface density to face - on , we took inclinations of @xmath34 for ic 2163 and @xmath35 for ngc 2207 @xcite .",
    "we discuss the implications of different @xmath36 and @xmath37 in section [ sfrcorrel ] .",
    "the 24  flux density , @xmath38 , of _ feature i _ and the galaxies as a whole were measured from the mips 1 pbcd image obtained from the spitzer archive in 2013 ; the resolution is @xmath39 .",
    "other star - forming regions were measured on the hires deconvolution image ( @xmath40 resolution ) by @xcite , who provided their hires 24  data to us as a fits image . according to velusamy",
    "the hires deconvolution conserves fluxes of point sources to better than 5% .",
    "this uncertainty is in addition to the 5% uncertainty in the mips 1 photometric calibration .",
    "the hires deconvolution has about the same resolution as our co data .",
    "this high resolution minimizes line - of - sight corrections for diffuse emission at 24  that is not coincident with the star - forming region @xcite .",
    "the absolute calibration of the 24  term in the sfr leads to an uncertainty of about 25% in the absolute determination of the sfr @xcite .",
    "the hi is from vla observations obtained in 1990 using a hybrid cnb array with an extended north arm to compensate for the low latitude of the source .",
    "the duration on source was 6 hours ( for more details , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the map representing column density , @xmath41 , comes from an hi cube with a channel width of 21 km s@xmath2 , rms noise 0.73 mjy beam@xmath2 , and fwhm of the point spread function equal to @xmath42 .",
    "the product of the rms noise times the channel width is equivalent to a line - of - sight @xmath43 pc@xmath22 . before creating the hi column density map ,",
    "the hi data cube was masked in a similar manner to the co data described above ; none of our apertures contain blanks in hi .",
    "the h@xmath0 data stem from narrowband h@xmath0 images and broadband @xmath44 images obtained by deidre hunter with the lowell 1.1 m telescope in 1999 @xcite .",
    "four h@xmath0 images were combined for a total time of 3600 s , and three r band images were combined for a total of 900 s. the narrow filter excludes the redshifted [ nii ] line at 6583  , but includes the 6548   line , which may contribute as much as 15% of the light for solar metallicity . considering equation [ sfeq ] below , a systematic 15% decrease in the h@xmath0 flux after removal of [ nii ] amounts to an average decrease in @xmath13 of 5% .",
    "figure 1 displays the chosen regions as circular apertures overlaid on the co integrated intensity image , the hires @xmath45 m image , and the @xmath10 image , which has a point spread function of @xmath46 .",
    "the apertures were selected to have minimal overlap and to enclose regions with prominent 24 , @xmath10 , co and/or hi emission .",
    "they include three of the massive hi clouds in ic 2163 ( i2 , i3 , i5 ) and four in ngc 2207 ( n2 , n3 , n4 , n6 ) , even though some have little star formation .",
    "figure 2 shows the hi contours on co for ic 2163 ( top ) and ngc 2207 ( bottom ) , where the separate hi contributions from each galaxy were determined from the line kinematics . for ic 2163 the lowest contour level is @xmath47 pc@xmath22 , which is equivalent to three times the rms noise over 2 channel widths . for ngc 2207",
    "we omitted this contour level for clarity .",
    "table [ tab - global ] compares global values of @xmath28 , @xmath48 , the 24  flux density , @xmath38 , and the @xmath10 flux , @xmath49 , for the fields displayed in figure 1 . for the values of @xmath28 , @xmath38 , and @xmath49",
    ", we chose a right ascension of @xmath50 as the dividing line between ic 2163 and ngc 2207 .",
    "for @xmath48 , we included the tidal bridge of ic 2163 behind ngc 2207 and the spiral arm of ngc 2207 in front of ic 2163 .",
    "the values listed under @xmath48 ( total ) include the hi emission outside the field in figure 1 ; the values listed under @xmath48 ( co field ) are only for the field in that figure . for ic 2163 ,",
    "the value of @xmath38 measured on the hires image is 84% of that measured on the mips 1 pbcd image ( the hires image is less sensitive to faint extended emission ) .",
    "table [ tab - global ] indicates that ic 2163 has a total molecular mass @xmath51 , which corresponds to an integrated co line flux of 240 jy km s@xmath2 , and ngc 2207 has @xmath52 for a co line flux of 265 jy km s@xmath2 .",
    "if we restrict the hi to the field of figure 1 , then the global ratio of molecular to atomic gas is 4 times greater in ic 2163 than in ngc 2207 . for most of the 15 apertures in ic 2163 ( except those on the massive hi clouds ) , the column density @xmath53 ) dominates @xmath41 , while for most of the 29 apertures in ngc 2207 , @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the eyelid shock in ic 2163 is currently more effective than the spiral arms of ngc 2207 in converting hi to h@xmath30 . also , the global ratio of @xmath28 to 24  flux density is @xmath55 times greater in ic 2163 than in ngc 2207 , and the global ratio of @xmath28 to @xmath10 flux is @xmath56 times greater in ic 2163 than in ngc 2207 .",
    "these molecular excesses compared to star formation in ic 2163 are not as large as the molecular excesses compared to atomic gas as traced by hi .",
    "this difference suggests that the encounter has converted a high fraction of hi into h@xmath30 in ic 2163 but has not ( yet ) converted the additional molecules into stars .",
    "a combination of the continuum - subtracted @xmath10 image @xcite and the spitzer mips 24  image was used to obtain the sfr , following @xcite , @xmath57 + 0.031 l[24\\mu m]\\right ) \\label{sfeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are in erg s@xmath2 , and @xmath60 .",
    "we chose source apertures with a diameter of @xmath61 kpc .",
    "this choice was governed by the hi resolution and by the need to have a sufficiently large aperture to avoid stochastic effects from including too few o stars when using h@xmath0  as a star - formation tracer .",
    "for the 24  measurement of _ feature i _ , we did a local background subtraction and applied an aperture flux correction factor of 1.61 from the mips instrument handbook .",
    "it was not necessary to remove background for the co or hi sources , nor for the other hires 24  sources . for @xmath10 ,",
    "we did a global background subtraction but not a local subtraction because there would be contamination from adjacent sources in many cases .    foreground galactic extinction @xmath62 mag from ned ( using * ? ? ?",
    "* ) gives an extinction at @xmath10 equal to @xmath63 mag .",
    "in addition , ic 2163 is affected by extinction from the foreground spiral arm of ngc 2207 .",
    "since the outer part of ngc 2207 is likely to be metal poor , we take @xmath64 for this region @xcite .",
    "this additional extinction is applied to 8 of the 15 regions in ic 2163 .",
    "these 8 have the highest foreground @xmath41 and the largest corrections ( @xmath65 mag ) , with an average @xmath66 mag from the foreground hi in ngc 2207 .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 and 24  emission from the foreground part of ngc 2207 are negligible .",
    "table [ tab - location ] compiles the locations , luminosities , sfrs , @xmath13 , and surface densities for h@xmath30 and hi in all of the chosen apertures .",
    "the regions associated with massive hi clouds are indicated by the footnote _ h_. the sfr is lower than 0.001 in the massive hi cloud apertures a10 and a33 .",
    "this is below the limit suggested by @xcite where the sfr can be reliably determined using the above method ; the actual values do not contribute to the conclusions of this paper .",
    "the conventional way to consider star formation on galactic scales is in terms of the correlation between @xmath13 and gas surface density ( the `` kennicutt - schmidt '' relation ) , either for hi ( @xmath67 ) , h@xmath30 ( @xmath68 ) , or the sum of these @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c ] shows these correlations .",
    "figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](a ) has the total gas relation , figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](b ) has h@xmath30 alone , [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](c ) has hi alone , and [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](d ) shows @xmath13 versus @xmath69 , the molecular ratio .",
    "figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](d ) is divided into three parts : where @xmath70 , the green points are for a molecular ratio less then 1 and the red points are for a molecular ratio greater than 1 . where @xmath71 , the blue points are plotted for all molecular ratios . these colors have the same meaning in the other panels .",
    "first consider the molecular relation in figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](b ) . in the things survey",
    "@xcite , this was linear with a constant consumption time per co molecule of 1 - 2 gyr .",
    "this is the case here too , but only for the red and blue points , i.e. , for the molecular - dominated gas at high sfr and all of the gas at low sfr .",
    "the hi - dominated gas at high sfr ( green points ) lies high off the linear molecular relation .",
    "the scatter in the molecular kennicutt - schmidt relation in @xcite is @xmath72 dex for @xmath73 , which is three times smaller than the displacement of the green points from the red+blue point correlation in figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](b ) .",
    "the h@xmath30 consumption time for the hi - dominated gas is @xmath74 myr , which is relatively fast compared to the time for the h@xmath30-dominated gas .",
    "the red circles around the points are for locations in the ocular rim of ic 2163 .    the total - gas relation in figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](a )",
    "has a consumption time for total gas of about 1 gyr in regions with high sfrs ( green and red points ) .",
    "this time is normal for molecular gas , but here it includes hi and also applies in hi - dominated regions ( green points ) . the blue points ( low sfr )",
    "have longer total - gas consumption times , between @xmath56 and 10 gyr .    in figure",
    "[ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](c ) , the molecular - dominated regions ( red points ) have relatively low hi and the hi - dominated regions ( green points ) have relatively high hi .",
    "the values for the hi surface density in the hi - dominated , high sfr regions are unusually high : @xmath67 is greater than @xmath75 pc@xmath22 in many cases , which is twice as large as the saturated value of hi in the things survey @xcite .",
    "what is peculiar about these relationships is the hi . if we ignore the hi - rich , high sfr regions ( green points ) , then the molecular relation in figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](b ) is normal ; the nearly constant @xmath67 up to @xmath76 pc@xmath22 for the high - sfr regions ( red points ) in figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](c ) is normal , and the steady increase in @xmath13 with molecular fraction in figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](d ) is normal . in these galaxies , however , there is a component of high hi column density gas where the sfr is high also .",
    "the hi is replacing some fraction of the molecules , giving a linear relation when the sfr is plotted against the total gas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](a ) ) .",
    "similarly , the hi - dominated regions lie off the normal linear law when the sfr is plotted versus only the molecular part of the gas ( fig . [",
    "fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](b ) ) .",
    "we also note that the molecular ratio @xmath77 increases with decreasing @xmath78 $ ] ( not shown ) suggesting more optical extinction in the star - forming cores when the molecular content is high .",
    "figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks3 ] shows the locations of these three types of regions on the sky using the same color scheme as in figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c ] .",
    "the hi - rich regions of high @xmath13 are on the periphery of the galaxy that underwent the retrograde , perpendicular encounter ( ngc 2207 ) and are globally coincident with the areas of high hi velocity dispersion in that galaxy ( see elmegreen et al .",
    "the h@xmath30-rich regions of high @xmath13 are mainly in the ocular ridge of ic 2163 where in - plane tidal forces produced a compression .",
    "the low @xmath13 regions are scattered across both galaxies .",
    "_ feature i _ in each panel ( denoted by `` i '' ) has @xmath13 at least a factor of @xmath79 higher than in any other region .",
    "the molecular mass of _ feature i _",
    "is @xmath80 @xmath81 , which is not unusual for these 2.4 kpc diameter apertures . in ic 2163 , 11 of the 15 apertures",
    "have molecular masses greater than this ( table [ tab - location ] ) , and the mass in region a9 is 2.5 times greater .",
    "however , because of the high sfr , the molecular gas consumption time for _ feature i _ , @xmath82 myr , is much shorter than for the other regions , and the total gas consumption time , @xmath83 myr , is shorter too , as indicated by the positions of _ feature i _ relative to the dashed red lines in figures [ fig : n2207_alma_ks1c](b ) and ( a ) , respectively .    a lower @xmath36 as suggested for some interacting galaxies and in @xcite would decrease the h@xmath30 mass and strengthen the conclusion that there are hi - rich star - forming regions with peculiar cloud structure .",
    "a higher @xmath36 would bring the h@xmath30 content of these regions in line with the co - bright regions , but then @xmath36 would have to vary from cloud to cloud and be high primarily in the outer parts of ngc 2207 , where the peculiar hi gas is .",
    "these outer parts are not so remote that low metallicities and an associated high @xmath36 are expected .",
    "higher @xmath36 is also unlikely because the high velocity dispersion should lower the co opacity by broadening the line , producing more co emission per unit h@xmath30 molecule @xcite .",
    "inclination effects would not seem to be causing the peculiar hi either .",
    "the suspected warp in ngc 2207 occurs about where this hi is , but correcting for that by lengthening the line - of - sight for gas emission only strengthens the conclusions because it lowers the average density for the observed column of hi and makes star formation slower , when in fact it is faster than normal .",
    "changing the inclination slides points parallel to the lines of constant gas consumption time in the kennicutt - schmidt relation because it affects the deprojected areas used for the ordinate and abscissa equally .    a second version of figure [ fig : n2207_alma_ks3 ]",
    "was made ( not shown ) with all of the images convolved to @xmath84 resolution before the measurements were made inside the same apertures .",
    "this change had the effect of decreasing the fluxes used for the sfrs and @xmath68 by factors between 0.5 and 0.9 , and that moved the points in the figure slightly down and to the left in a direction nearly parallel to the lines of constant consumption time .",
    "considering the wings of the gaussian , this is the expected reduction factor for a small source located somewhere in the aperture when the aperture diameter is the same as the fwhm of the point spread function in the convolved image .",
    "none of the conclusions of this paper were affected by this change .",
    "hi - dominated regions with high sfrs are unusual and could be related to the high turbulent speeds in this interacting pair .",
    "the mean hi velocity dispersion for the 16 green circles in n2207 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n2207_alma_ks3 ] ) is 42 km s@xmath2 , compared to @xmath85 km s@xmath2 in normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "an interaction perturbs the smooth circular flow of gas and causes deflected streams to intersect each other at high speeds , producing shocks and a turbulent cascade .",
    "numerical simulations show this effect @xcite .",
    "some turbulent energy in ngc 2207 may also come from excited vertical motions .",
    "high velocity dispersions in interacting systems were also reported by @xcite , @xcite and others . in comparison ,",
    "the things galaxies and most others used for the conventional sfr - gas correlations are not interacting .    stronger shocks imply a greater compressive component to the turbulence , as opposed to a normally dominant rotational component @xcite .",
    "tidal forces can increase the compressive mode too @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the probability distribution function for density flattens from an approximately log - normal @xcite shape to a broad distribution where a large amount of low - density atomic gas co - exists with a large amount of high - density star - forming gas @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate may scale with the mass of the high density gas as usual ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "physically , this implies a change in the structure of clouds toward more extended hi envelopes around denser h@xmath30 and co cores .",
    "the molecular envelop traced by co in a self - gravitating cloud usually contributes to the gas surface density in the molecular star formation law . here , the envelopes may be puffed up with high velocity dispersions , giving them low densities and a transparency that keeps them predominantly atomic .",
    "then the envelopes act physically like the co envelopes of star - forming clouds in non - interacting galaxies , but produce a star formation law with a significant amount of hi and dark @xmath86 substituted for co - bright gas .    another possibility for the hi - rich regions of high sfr",
    "is that there is large - scale synchronization of star formation in ngc 2207 , starting at perigalacticon @xmath3 myr ago , whereby many of the giant molecular clouds formed in the outer parts have just now dispersed into hi before their ob associations have significantly faded .",

    "<S> co observations of the interacting galaxies ic 2163 and ngc 2207 are combined with hi , h@xmath0 and 24 @xmath1 m to study the star formation rate ( sfr ) surface density as a function of the gas surface density . </S>",
    "<S> more than half of the high sfr regions are hi dominated . </S>",
    "<S> when compared to other galaxies , these hi - dominated regions have excess sfrs relative to their molecular gas surface densities but normal sfrs relative to their total gas surface densities . </S>",
    "<S> the hi - dominated regions are mostly located in the outer part of ngc 2207 , where the hi velocity dispersion is high , 40 - 50 km s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the star - forming clouds in these regions have envelopes at lower densities than normal , making them predominantly atomic , and cores at higher densities than normal because of the high turbulent mach numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with theoretical predictions of a flattening in the density probability distribution function for compressive , high mach number turbulence . </S>"
