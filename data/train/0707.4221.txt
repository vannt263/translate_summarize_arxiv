    "this means that in the variations of the kinetic energy part we can keep only the piece in @xmath21 , since the other part ( @xmath22 ) of the variation should cancel with the @xmath21 contribution to the kinetic operators of order @xmath23 , which we have not considered .",

    "the other remarkable value is @xmath30 where the symmetry is enhanced with a weyl invariance , denoted by wtdiff , and the wave operator is traceless in the absence of cosmological constant . to be specific , ^d^h_=(c_3-)h + ( c_2- )",
    "the analysis in @xcite shows that these two are the only instances where only spin two is present , with no scalar contamination .",

    "it is mandatory to substitute all derivatives by background covariant derivatives , i.e. , _",
    "h_|_h _ and to raise and lower indices using the corresponding background metric : h^|g^|g^h _",
    "let us study now consistency of the coupling , which was the main motivation of this work .",
    "the matter lagrangian has been denoted by @xmath34 . up to dimension five operators for a scalar field , which in a free falling locally inertial reference system has lagrangian l^0_m=^__- v ( ) assuming a @xmath35 symmetry -the allowed matter operators when a gravitational field is present can be parameterized by three constants , @xmath36 : [ matt ] l_m=^__-v()+ ( - h^__+ _ 2 h^__- _ 3 v ( ) )",
    "remember that the variation of a scalar field is = ^_in order to enjoy tdiff invariance , it is necessary that @xmath37 .",
    "diff invariance needs in addition that @xmath38 .",
    "the matter equations of motion are = -- v^()+ ( _ 1_(h^_)- _ ( h ^)-_3 v^ ( ) ) and the gravitational equations [ graveq ] = d^h_- ( _",
    "1__+ ( _ 3 v()-(_)^2 ) _ ) there is generically no problem of consistency , except in the two exceptional cases .",
    "first of all , when @xmath11 has extended diff symmetry , and consequently a transverse wave operator , this forces @xmath34 to have the same diff symmetry through the linear expansion of the @xmath39 term ; otherwise consistency of the coupling enforces extra condictions on the matter , a very weird situation indeed ( i.e. bianchi identities are still valid on the gravitational side , so that by consistency the same identities must hold true on the matter side as well ) . nevertheless , it is not fully devoid of interest to study the situations in which there are exceptions to this rule ; this we did in a previous work @xcite .",
    "when there is wtdiff symmetry , it is clear that the matter lagrangian should also be scale invariant in order for the corresponding energy - momentum to be traceless . in our example",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "there are models in which diff invariance in the matter sector is reached using in the volume element some other scalar density , such as the square root of the determinant of a matrix built out of fields and their derivatives ( as in the very interesting ones proposed in @xcite ) instead of the @xmath39 term implicit in the metric volume element .",
    "the tensor that appears as the source of gravity in einstein s equations is covariantly conserved thanks to the equations of motion of the fields in the scalar density .",
    "of course that tensor is not the usual energy - momentum tensor of general relativity , which now is not conserved .",
    "the reason is that in order for the rosenfeld energy - momentum tensor to be equivalent to the canonical belinfante one what is needed is not only diff invariance , but also the standard metric volume element @xcite .",
    "this topic seems worthy of some further investigation .",
    "in this section we will outline the way in which one can constraint the space of paramaters of the linearized theory ( i.e. @xmath13 , @xmath42 and @xmath15 ) using experimental results on deviations from newton s inverse square law . for simplicity",
    "we will illustrate with a very particular example so no definite conclusions can be drawn concerning the viability of this kind of models .",
    "detailed computations of the propagators can be found in @xcite , where the authors considered a gravitational lagrangian ( [ grav ] ) with all @xmath43 except @xmath44 which has the interpretation of a mass for the scalar part of the graviton , present generically in this kind of models with tdiff invariance .",
    "it turns out that for a conserved energy - momentum tensor coupled to gravity in the form [ coup ] l_i = h_(_1t^+_2^t ) then in momentum space the interaction is l_i=_1 ^ 2-(_2+_1)^2 where we have defined c = c_3-+c_2-c_2 ^ 2 with the constraint @xmath45 because of unitarity @xcite .",
    "the first term corresponds to the usual spin 2 exchange while the second one is an additional massive scalar interaction .",
    "let us turn our attention to a particular example , namely the matter lagrangian ( [ matt ] ) . unfortunately the corresponding energy momentum tensor is not conserved .",
    "however , a conserved tensor can be defined as _ & & t_-_((_)^2+(_3 - 1)v())+ o()= + & = & _ _ -_((_)^2-v())+ o ( ) in the particular case that @xmath46 ( which includes the diff invariant lagrangian ) our energy - momentum tensor can be written in terms of the new one and its trace in such a way that the coupling @xmath47 is of the form ( [ coup ] ) with & & _",
    "1= + & & _ 2= now we can apply directly the preceeding results and study experimental constraints to this model .",
    "the exchange of additional massive scalar degrees of freedom produces a yukawa like potential which is usually parametrized as @xcite v(r)~(1+e^- ) the parameter @xmath48 is then the ratio between the spin 2 and the scalar couplings , in our particular case [ alfa ] = -=- while @xmath49 gives the range of the interaction , or equvalently the mass of the scalar exchanged [ landa ] ^2= notice that one has to impose @xmath50 since as we have said absence of ghosts requires @xmath45 .",
    "there are important constraints on the strength of hypothetical yukawa interactions for a wide range of @xmath49 . through ( [ alfa ] ) and ( [ landa ] )",
    "it is then possible to constraint the space of parameters of the linearized theory .",
    "we will use figures 4 , 5 and 9 of reference @xcite , which show regions allowed and excluded for @xmath48 corresponding to @xmath49 in the ranges @xmath51m-@xmath52 m , @xmath52m-@xmath53 m and @xmath53m-@xmath54 m respectively .",
    "since we are just interested in general behaviours and not in accurate results we will approximate the experimental curves by straight lines .",
    "the original plots are in logarithmic scale so we have experimentally allowed regions of the form [ curve ] ||<k^a we just have to substitute this expresion into ( [ alfa ] ) to get bounds for our parameters .",
    "there are however four parameters to play with ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "first , it is interesting to see the order of magnitude for the mass once we fix the values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the result is ploted in fig.[m2.n2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that greater values for the mass are favoured , being the lower bound around @xmath59 , and that the allowed region rapidly decreases with @xmath60 .    ]    another possibility is to fix @xmath61 and @xmath55 and see , in the plane ( @xmath57,@xmath58 ) , how far from diff invariance ( which corresponds to @xmath62 ) can we move away",
    ". remember that we also have to take into account the restriction @xmath63 .",
    "for the first range , @xmath64m-@xmath52 m there is no hope of seeing an experimental curve that appreciably deviates from the parabola @xmath65 because of ( [ landa ] ) and the tiny values of @xmath49 .",
    "increasing @xmath61 does increase the allowed region , which is between both curves , but does not produce a plot in which the curves are visibly separate .",
    "it can be understood if we realise that increasing the mass also increases @xmath58 on the parabola through @xmath57 and ( [ alfa])-([landa ] ) .",
    "an approximate definition of the separation could be sep~= where @xmath66 and @xmath67 means the value of @xmath58 on the parabola and the experimental curve respectively .",
    "for the first experimental range one has @xmath68 independently of the mass and in the whole interval .",
    "the other two cases do not have that property , which is of course related also with the particular values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 in ( [ curve ] ) .",
    "examples of resulting plots are figs.[c3.c2.1],@xmath71[c3.c2.2 ] and [ c3.c2.3 ] .",
    "once again the experiment prefers greater values for the mass .",
    "all the plots have @xmath72 , other values just move the experimental curve along the parabola , but the qualitative result remains unchanged .    ]    ]    ]",
    "in this paper we have studied at the linearized level the viability of gravity models with a restricted symmetry , both from the theoretical and observational points of view . while the existing observational constraints on additional yukawa like gravitatory interactions do not seem to be a major obstacle , a consistency problem has been identified . at the non linear level it appeared as an integrability condition on einstein s equations @xcite .",
    "here we turned our attention to the linear level in order to see if the problem could be avoided , and if so in what type of more clever non linear completions .",
    "the main conclusion is that it is not generically possible to couple matter ( i.e. , with an arbitrary equation of state ) to gravitation in such a way that this coupling has a restricted symmetry only ( what has been called tdiff ) whereas the purely gravitational sector enjoys a higher symmetry , namely the standard diff invariance , or an additional weyl symmetry ( wtdiff ) . that this is possible in some restricted cases has been already found in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the condition for arbitrary tdiff matter to be able to couple to diff gravity without restrictions can be stated somewhat more formally by saying that the rosenfeld ( metric ) energy - momentum tensor has got to be equivalent to the belinfante canonical form .",
    "on the other hand , there is a widespread _ urban legend _ asserting that unimodular theories are equivalent to general relativity with a cosmological constant .",
    "specific calculations both here and in our previous paper @xcite have proven it to be groundless .",
    "it is a fact that in some tdiff models there is no exponential expansion at all which is well known to be the benchmark of a ( positive ) cosmological constant in general relativity .",
    "therefore , that models provide a counterexample to the statement above .    nevertheless , as with all legends , there is some partial truth in it .",
    "the equations of motion of the example in @xcite correspond to @xmath73 and @xmath74 , that is [ t ] d^fp_=__whereas the linear equations of general relativity with cosmological constant read : [ gr ] d^fp_+ _ = ( _ _ + ( v()-(_)^2 ) _ ) now , the equations ( [ t ] ) are inconsistent as such , in the sense that only a subsector of the theory , namely , the one that obeys [ ic ] v-(_)^2= c can be coupled to gravitation .",
    "there are many sectors of matter in a freely falling inertial system that do not obey thisrestriction .",
    "actually , together with energy conservation , the aforementioned equation implies that both the kinetic and potential energy ought to be constant : & & 2 v()= e + c + & & ( _ ) ^2 = e - c it is clear that for a scalar field in flat space most initial conditions lead to configurations that violate those equations .",
    "this would mean that an inconsistency would show up once a gravitational field is turned on , however weak .",
    "more formally , something very strange should happen when changing the reference frame from an inertial ( freely falling one ) to another in which a gravitational field is present .",
    "those are the reasons what we say that the coupling is generically inconsistent .",
    "let us accept nevertheless , for the sake of the argument , that physics is so restricted .",
    "then a glance at the equations ( [ gr ] ) of general relativity shows that they are indeed equivalent to ( [ t ] ) _ provided _ we identify  but this is only due to our choice of the arbitrary constants , and under the asumption that the coupled sector is only the one that obeys ( [ ic ] ) , a deeply misterious condition from a general relativistic perspective . in the general tdiff case",
    "the analogous condition to ( [ ic ] ) is -(_)^2+(_3 - 1)v()=c and the system is not equivalent to general relativity with a cosmological constant .",
