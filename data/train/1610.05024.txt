    "<S> ( [ eq : band ] ) allow us to extract a value @xmath60  mev ( see supplemental material for a derivation ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies a typical energy scale @xmath61  mev above which 1d signatures should be observed . </S>",
    "<S> a simple cross check of this value can be obtained by comparing the relative band bottoms throughout the brillouin zone along the @xmath18 direction with that expected from a bandwidth of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> these are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure 2]a - c by black horizontal bands and show good agreement .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure 4]b we show the @xmath20-integrated arpes intensity at @xmath22 within 400  mev of @xmath27 and for different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity approximates the density of states ( dos ) multiplied by the fermi function , apart from inessential corrections associated with the finite experimental resolution and weak @xmath18 dispersion , and assuming that photoemission matrix elements do not depend on temperature . at the lowest temperatures , the dos suppression near @xmath27 is markedly different from the expected fermi edge and resembles a power law . </S>",
    "<S> we rule out cdw gaps as a possible explanation for this anomalous suppression of spectral weight : the cdw gaps seen at finite energy in our data have a typical peak - to - peak size of 70  mev ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure 3]c ) , while the dos suppression occurs over a much wider energy range . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the signatures of the cdw in the dos are rather weak : they can be identified near @xmath62  mev and @xmath63  mev in the momentum - integrated arpes below the cdw temperatures @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure 4]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a complete gapping of the fermi surface would also be inconsistent with the fact that nbse@xmath0 remains metallic even at these low temperatures @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the power - law depletion evokes a tll where the dos is suppressed like @xmath66 at low energy due to the disappearance of single - particle excitations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - universal exponent @xmath67 ( see supplemental material ) depends on the parameter @xmath68 which measures the strength of interactions and varies between 0.4 @xmath69 1 in the extended hubbard model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) corresponds to a non - interacting electron system with flat dos .    </S>",
    "<S> tll signatures should be searched for at energies and/or temperatures larger than @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our highest measured temperature ( 260  k ) is well below the crossover scale ( @xmath72 mev @xmath73  k ) , such that our whole data set can be regarded as being in a low - temperature regime with respect to the dimensional crossover . in the cdw state , </S>",
    "<S> the dos at @xmath74 is perturbed by the cdw gaps such that tll signatures may be masked if present . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore look for the tll power law at temperatures higher than @xmath3  k. we fit the data with an expression giving the finite-@xmath48 dos of a tll @xcite convolved by our experimental resolution ( see supplemental material for further details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fits are performed in a variable energy range @xmath75 $ ] around @xmath27 and we extract the exponent @xmath76 as a function of this range ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : figure 4]c ) . at @xmath77 , </S>",
    "<S> the data are consistent with a pure fermi edge with @xmath71 ( 3d regime ) , while at @xmath78 , the fit yields a stable exponent @xmath50 ( @xmath79 ) over a broad energy range ( 1d regime ) . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure yields a continuous evolution from @xmath71 to @xmath80 as a function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the fit quality ( see supplemental material ) shows that the best fits are obtained for an upper @xmath81-bound between 0.2 and 0.3  ev , thus avoiding the dos upturn near @xmath82  ev . figure [ fig : figure 4]b shows the best fits with @xmath83  ev and the corresponding tll exponents for @xmath84  k. for @xmath85 , the fit deteriorates and the extracted exponent becomes strongly energy dependent due to the cdw gaps , while the exponent at low @xmath81 increases steadily with decreasing @xmath48 due to the anomalous spectral - weight suppression . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the tll spectral function is not an appropriate description of the system at these low temperatures where a fl phase is expected . </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion is supported by the fact that , although the anomalous suppression also resembles a power law ( fig .  [ fig : figure 4]b ) , explaining its exponent as a tll signature requires unrealistically strong interactions with @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that power - law dos suppressions with exponents close to @xmath87 have been reported for at least two other quasi-1d systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis supports the idea that nbse@xmath0 is never observed in a truly tll regime up to room temperature . instead below a temperature of 1400  k , </S>",
    "<S> a gradual crossover from 1d to 3d takes place , as evidenced by the energy - dependence of the @xmath76 exponent . </S>",
    "<S> this crossover culminates in the formation of a cdw ground state at low temperatures .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed detailed arpes measurements over a wide temperature range which reveal evidence of a dimensional crossover in nbse@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such a dimensional crossover is consistent with the quasi-1d warping of the fermi surface , which is also presented here for the first time . a careful analysis of the density of states and comparison with expectations for 1d behavior reveal a changing dimensionality of excitations above a characteristic energy @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> at low temperatures we observe cdw gaps in the electronic structure at the momenta indicated by x - ray diffraction . </S>",
    "<S> we expect the analysis presented here to be applicable to other quasi-1d systems due to the generality of finite inter - chain coupling in real materials , and hope this will stimulate further experimental and theoretical research on the dimensional crossover .    </S>",
