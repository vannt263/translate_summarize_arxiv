    "the fact that quantum physics contradicts local - realism is one of the most seminal discoveries . in his pioneering work @xcite",
    ", john s. bell showed that the statistical behavior of a bipartite qubit system is irreconcilable with any local - realistic theory when the system is in a singlet state .",
    "he revealed that for such theories correlations are bounded by constraints which , however , can be violated if the setup is handled quantum physically . since then much effort has been made to fully understand the origins and conditions that allow to demonstrate and experimentally test this contradiction known as quantum nonlocality . nowadays",
    ", a variety of so - called bell inequalities is known .",
    "recent bell inequalities also cover systems with more than two degrees of freedom @xcite and/or more than two parties @xcite .    yet",
    ", the relation between entanglement and nonlocality is not completely clarified apart from the fact that bell inequality violations are a consequence of the presence of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the existence of entangled states that do not violate any bell inequality @xcite has raised several questions .",
    "first , how far can bell inequalities be improved and is it possible for a given system to systematically derive the most powerful inequality or a set of those ( see @xcite for recent approaches ) ?",
    "second , which entangled states allow a local  realistic description even if locc ( local operators and classical communication ) and povms ( positive operator valued measurements ) are used and what are their characteristics ?",
    "besides that , a connection between the violation of a bell inequality and the security of quantum cryptography was shown , attesting to the importance of further investigations @xcite .",
    "a nontrivial connection between nonlocality and entanglement was found by investigating the collins  gisin  linden  massar  popescu  bell ( cglmp ) inequality @xcite . in particular , it was shown that maximal violation is achieved with non - maximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "similar features were also found in @xcite for neutral k ",
    "mesons , which are two level systems oscillating and decaying in time .",
    "for this system entangled in strangeness , though having only two degrees of freedom one finds no violation of the chsh  bell inequality if the system is prepared in the spin singlet state copiously produced in accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "a violation is only achieved if a non  maximally entangled state is used .",
    "furthermore , a relation between bell inequality violation and the violation of the @xmath1 symmetry ( @xmath2 - charge conjugation , @xmath3 - parity ) in particle physics was established @xcite .",
    "( it should be noted that this particular system in high energy physics is considerably different from systems not being affected by decay processes ) .",
    "another example demonstrating the fundamental difference between entanglement and nonlocality is given in @xcite .",
    "here , it is shown that the simulation of non - maximally entangled states via so - called non - local boxes ( or popescu - rohrlich boxes ) requires more resources than the simulation of a bell state .    in the present work we aim to study nonlocality and entanglement in the context of state space geometry .",
    "that is , we consider these properties using descriptive real vector representations for density matrices .",
    "our main motivation is the fact that geometric considerations of the state space can provide deeper insights into quantum physics .",
    "they are also ideal to obtain an impression of the volumes related to certain properties or the strength of particular criteria . in case of a single qubit a geometric representation",
    "is given by the well - known three dimensional bloch - vector where the state space is called the bloch - sphere . regarding",
    "multipartite systems one usually tries to find representations where local properties and correlations can be separated in different quantities in order to avoid unwanted complexity caused by high - dimensionality .",
    "hence , when it comes to studying entanglement and nonlocality of a certain system it suffices to investigate representatives of equivalence classes of states which are equivalent with respect to local unitary transformations . in this way , for bipartite qubits it was found that correlations can be summarized in a three  dimensional vector lying within a regular tetrahedron @xcite . for the investigation of bipartite qudit systems we utilize a proposed generalization of this tetrahedron  a regular simplex spanned by mutually orthogonal maximally entangled states @xcite .",
    "our goal is to visualize and compare the geometries of the boundaries of entanglement and nonlocality of low - dimensional subsections of this set of states .    in order to do so",
    ", we choose certain classes of states for which via optimal entanglement witnesses we are able to exactly determine the boundary between separable and entangled states .",
    "for the same classes we then reveal all states that violate the cglmp  bell inequality . determining , for a given state , whether it violates or obeys a certain bell inequality is a high  dimensional nonlinear optimization problem which is difficult to solve even for low  dimensional quantum systems . in sec .",
    "[ nonlocalstates ] we show how this problem can be solved utilizing an advantageous parameterization of the unitary group @xmath0 and robust numerical methods .    our main results concerning the geometry of nonlocality and entanglement are given in sec .",
    "[ vischsh ] for bipartite qubits and in sec .",
    "[ visqutrits ] for bipartite qutrits . in sec .",
    "[ measure ] we extend our geometric considerations by incorporating a comparison between bell inequality violation and an entanglement measure .",
    "our results show that both quantities are so intrinsically different that not even for mixtures of states sharing the same amount of entanglement the relation is monotone .",
    "we begin by reviewing the foundations of bell inequalities . any local - realistic description of a bipartite system with @xmath4 outcomes and @xmath5 measurement apparatuses on each side implies the existence of @xmath6 probabilities @xmath7 with normalization @xmath8 determining the statistics of the observables @xmath9 which can take on the values @xmath10 @xcite . as it is known , probability distributions of this form can not reproduce the statistical behavior of composite quantum systems @xmath11 when the system is in a certain state and the observables are chosen appropriately . in order to reveal this , one constructs quantities @xmath12 that consist of linear combinations of joint probabilities @xmath13 and shows that they are bounded , i.e. @xmath14 if ( [ probdist ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) are assumed .",
    "if this bound can be exceeded when the system is treated quantum physically then the established inequality ( [ bellineq ] ) is called a bell inequality .",
    "states that can not be described by a local - realistic theory are said to be nonlocal .",
    "one way of detecting nonlocality of a certain state @xmath15 is to show that it violates a bell inequality .",
    "the set of nonlocal states is complementary to the set of local states whose elements allow probability distributions of the form ( [ probdist ] ) with ( [ norm ] ) for any number of apparatuses @xmath5 . it should be noted that proving locality of a state is generally difficult since , in principle , it has to be shown that any bell inequality is satisfied or an explicit local realistic description has to be found .",
    "unfortunately , also the problem of determining whether a particular bell inequality is violated or obeyed for a given entangled state is nontrivial .    in detail , to show that a certain state @xmath15 possesses nonlocal correlations one has to consider quantum mechanical joint probabilities @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are orthonormal eigenvectors of the corresponding observables of alice @xmath19 and bob @xmath20 .",
    "these probabilities are then inserted into the quantity @xmath12 corresponding to a particular bell inequality ( [ bellineq ] ) which can then be rewritten in the form @xmath21 wherein @xmath22 is called the bell operator @xcite .    in order to examine if the inequality is preserved or violated for a given @xmath15 one has find observables that yield the maximum of @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath23 this is in general a high - dimensional nonlinear constrained optimization problem for which analytic solutions are only known for a few special cases @xcite . most often , the quantity @xmath12 has to be maximized numerically for each given @xmath15 .    numerical tractability and reliability is closely related to the formulation and parameterization of the problem .",
    "our problem can be brought into a computationally beneficial form in the following way : the outcome of @xmath12 depends on the choice of the observables @xmath24 and @xmath25 , i.e. the orthonormal bases @xmath26 and @xmath27 . since all orthonormal bases are local - unitarily related , our problem is equivalent to determining a set of unitary transformations @xmath28 and @xmath29 that maximizes @xmath12 .",
    "it is unknown whether or not there exists a restrictive set of unitaries that in all cases contains the global maximum : unbiased multiport beam splitters @xcite containing only few parameters were shown to be too restrictive in general @xcite .",
    "consequently , we have to take into account all possible unitary transformations , i.e. the unitary group @xmath0 .",
    "regarding our problem we utilize the recently introduced composite parameterization of @xmath0 @xcite allowing an efficient variation .",
    "this parameterization is composed of elementary two - dimensional rotations and one - dimensional phase transformations .",
    "explicitly , using one - dimensional projectors @xmath30 and generalized anti - symmetric @xmath31-matrices @xmath32 constructed with orthonormal basis vectors any unitary operator can be written as ] @xmath33 \\cdot \\left [ \\prod_{l=0}^{d-1 } \\mbox{exp}(i p_l \\lambda_{l , l})\\right ] \\",

    "we can exploit this structure to conveniently eliminate the @xmath4 physically irrelevant phases that are related to bases in @xmath46 .",
    "that is , starting from the basis that was used to define @xmath47 for the observables , one can remove the right part of the parameterization without discarding any solution , i.e. it suffices consider the transformations @xmath48 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] optimal values for the parameters can now be determined via search algorithms such as differential evolution @xcite , simulated annealing @xcite or the nelder - mead method @xcite . with respect to this ,",
    "the composite parameterization has various advantages compared to several other parameterizations .",
    "for instance , varying over @xmath0 by using arbitrary hermitian operators @xmath49 and computing @xmath50 as done in @xcite is computationally expensive @xcite ; thus , inappropriate for high - dimensional problems .",
    "computing @xmath47 however , is simple since it is only a product of the matrices @xmath51 , which explicitly read @xmath52 also the feature that the product @xmath53 leaves the subspace spanned by the basis vectors @xmath54 invariant for a fixed @xmath55 ( see @xcite ) improves the speed of the computation for large @xmath4 .",
    "efficiently , we multiply matrices that are smaller than @xmath40 and in each step @xmath56 the dimension is increased by one .",
    "another reason to use this particular parameterization besides its computational benefits is the fact that the parameters can directly be related to experimental setups , that is the upper right entries of ( [ parametermatrix ] ) correspond to settings of beam splitters and the lower left entries to phase shifters .",
    "a relevant bell inequality for bipartite systems of dimension @xmath40 is the collins  gisin  linden  massar  popescu  bell inequality @xcite . for @xmath57 observables on each side @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "it was shown that @xmath60\\\\ -\\bigl[&p(a_1=b_1-k-1)+p(b_1=a_2-k)\\\\ + & p(a_2=b_2-k-1)+p(b_2=a_1-k-1)\\bigr]\\bigr\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath61 is bounded by @xmath62 for local - realistic theories .",
    "this inequality can be seen as a generalization of the well known chsh ",
    "bell inequality @xcite since for @xmath63 they are equivalent .",
    "the cglmp - bell inequality was proven to correspond to facets of local - realistic correlations implied by ( [ probdist ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) for @xmath57 observables and therefore belongs to the class of tight bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "some known results on the cglmp  inequality can be used to test the power and reliability of our proposed algorithm . as shown in @xcite with a supposed set of optimal observables one can attain the values @xmath64 - 1}\\left(1-\\frac{2k}{d-1}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{d}(k+\\frac{1}{4})\\right)}-\\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{-\\pi}{d}(k+\\frac{3}{4})\\right)}\\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the maximally entangled state @xmath65 . by maximizing @xmath66 over all observables , i.e.",
    "the @xmath67 involved parameters @xmath35 as described in the previous section using the nelder - mead method we have been able to confirm these values up to dimension @xmath68 with an accuracy of @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the maximum of @xmath66 increases with dimension @xmath4 and lies within @xmath70 for @xmath63 and @xmath71 which is reached for large @xmath4 . for all investigated dimensions",
    "the algorithm has required only a few runs to find the value given by ( [ maxvalue ] ) due to the robustness of the nelder - mead method .",
    "similar approaches utilizing other parameterization also confirm ( [ maxvalue ] ) , however , since they are computationally less tractable they do not reach @xmath68 but only @xmath72 as in @xcite or @xmath73 as in @xcite . note that there are also techniques for deriving upper bounds on @xmath66 @xcite using semi - definite programming @xcite which can be used for small @xmath4 to prove that the found values are indeed global maxima . by maximizing the largest eigenvalue of @xmath74",
    "we could also confirm the results in @xcite , namely that for @xmath75 the maximal violation of the cglmp - inequality is attained with non  maximally entangled states .",
    "now , we come to the main issue of this paper , namely comparing entanglement and quantum nonlocality using geometric representations of the state space . for a single qubit such a representation",
    "is given by the three - dimensional bloch vector ( for generalized bloch vectors see @xcite ) . in a similar way , any density matrix of a bipartite qubit system can be written as @xmath76 with two three - dimensional real vectors @xmath77 and @xmath78 related the local properties and a real @xmath79 matrix @xmath80 related to correlations . with regard to studying entanglement and nonlocality , we are not interested in the local properties of the system . hence , local unitary transformations @xmath81 can be used to diagonalize the matrix @xmath80 ( for more details on this and the following steps see @xcite ) .",
    "the diagonal entries can be regarded as components of a three - dimensional real vector @xmath82 . due to the non - negativity condition @xmath83 the components of this vector",
    "must obey the inequalities and @xmath84 . ]",
    "@xmath85 these constraints restrict @xmath82 to lie within a regular tetrahedron spanned by the projectors of the four well - known bell states @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this tetrahedron represents the core of the state space we are interested in and for it , we determine the regions that are entangled or nonlocal , respectively .    for @xmath63 it was proven that the ppt ( positive under partial transposition @xcite ) criterion is necessary and sufficient , i.e. iff all eigenvalues of a partially transposed density matrix are non - negative then the state is separable ( for @xmath75 it is only a necessary criterion ) . by means of this criterion",
    "one finds that all states outside the octahedron spanned by the points @xmath88 and @xmath89 are entangled . for @xmath90 and @xmath84",
    "this is necessary and sufficient for entanglement .",
    "now , we complete this geometric picture introduced in @xcite by adding the geometry of quantum nonlocality . states of the tetrahedron that violate the chsh  bell inequality ( cglmp  inequality for @xmath63 ) can be determined analytically . according to the criterion given in @xcite",
    "the maximal attainable value for @xmath91 is @xmath92 , where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the two largest eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath95 having the components @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , since in our case @xmath80 is a diagonal matrix with the entries @xmath97 and @xmath98 the bell inequality is violated iff at least one of the three inequalities @xmath99 holds .",
    "this means that each of the inequalities defines a cylinder with radius @xmath100 and if a density matrix lies outside of one it is nonlocal .",
