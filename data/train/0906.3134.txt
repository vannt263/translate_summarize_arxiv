    "the search for new particles / interactions beyond the standard model is one of the most important tasks of particle physics .",
    "while several candidates and proposals may be considered as  exotic \" , in the sense of not being required by the data , it is generally agreed that there are some possibilities definitely expected as minimal extensions of it .",
    "axions ( @xcite-@xcite ) belong to the latter category , as expected from the peccei - quinn ( @xcite-@xcite ) solution to the strong cp - problem .",
    "axions are pseudo nambu - goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of the peccei - quinn symmetry . their masses and couplings",
    "are directly related to this symmetry - breaking scale .",
    "viable versions of axionic models include the ksvz ( @xcite,@xcite ) and dfsz ( @xcite-@xcite ) axions coupled to hadrons only and to leptons and hadrons respectively .",
    "in addition to experimental efforts for a direct detection of axions , astrophysical and cosmological arguments have played a key role in their search .",
    "actually , stringent bounds have been obtained from the consideration of horizontal branch stars ( @xcite-@xcite ) , white dwarf cooling and sn1987a neutrino pulse duration ( @xcite ) , among others .",
    "a general review of these arguments has been given in @xcite ( see also @xcite-@xcite for a thorough account ) .",
    "one of the main ingredients for an accurate calculation of axion mass bounds is the emissivity in the nucleon bremsstrahlung reaction @xmath0 , thought to be dominant in important astrophysical events , such as newly born neutron stars .",
    "calculations and discussions on the applicability of the emissivity formulae were given in @xcite,@xcite-@xcite . quite generally , in these papers , the calculations were performed for a one - pion exchange free nucleon gas , leaving aside important issues later incorporated and assessed , such as the effects of correlations between nucleons ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "attempts to link the emissivity to laboratory data have been also made .",
    "we would like to present in this communication a reassessment of the bremsstrahlung emissivity including the full momentum dependence of the matrix elements .",
    "we found that the hitherto neglected dependence produces large temperature - dependent corrections to the rates independently of the many body effects , a feature that points by itself to a revision of some of the astrophysical bounds .",
    "axion emission are important for the evolution of stars particularly for ( hot ) neutron stars ( ns ) . for the conditions relevant to the core of hot ns just after their formation ( @xmath1 mev , @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 the nuclear matter density ) the dominant emission process are the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) bremsstrahlung ( @xcite )    @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6    previous calculations of the axion emissivities have been performed by iwamoto ( @xcite,@xcite ) in the degenerate ( d ) limit . for the nn interaction he used a ope potential in the born approximation and found the expressions of the energy - loss rates for all the processes above .",
    "later on , brinkmann and turner @xcite calculated the axion emission rates in the nondegenerate ( nd ) limit and for a general degeneracy , for all three processes ( a -c ) .",
    "they also could check the result of iwamoto for the equal - nucleon cases in the ( d ) limit . for the nn interaction they used , however , constant nuclear matrix elements .",
    "the same results for the nd limit was also obtained previously by turner in @xcite .",
    "they reached the conclusion that nd regime is a better approximation of the axion emissivities for the conditions characteristic for a newly born neutron star .",
    "other calculations considering also a ope potential where performed by raffelt and seckel @xcite .",
    "they studied the axion emission rates of @xmath7 processes in order to determine their @xmath8 structure function for nn interactions in neutron stars . with their calculations they concluded that the inclusion of pion mass effects do not reduce the axion emissivities by more than 50% even for nd regime .",
    "our results will show that the contributions of pion mass to the coresponding emissivities due to nuclear effects are temperature dependent , and for a certain temperature interval are larger than this , as we will see later .",
    "therefore , in this article we pay special attention to the nd regime but we present also the results for d regime . for the contribution of the @xmath9 process",
    "we consider different chemical potentials for neutrons and protons , and as a result we can span different degeneracy degrees for the two species .",
    "analogously to the case of neutrino pair emission ( @xcite-@xcite ) , one of the main difficulties for the calculation of axion emissivities is the appropriate treatment of the strong nn interaction . in iwamoto",
    "s calculations for the d limit the effects were included by replacing the nucleon momenta by their fermi values in the angular part of the phase - space integrals .    in the present work",
    "we include the full dependence on nuclear momenta of the nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) in the calculations of the axion emission rates by the nn bremsstrahlung processes ( a - c ) .",
    "our results for @xmath10 separate explicitly the part corresponding to constant nme , which corresponds to the high - momentum limit of the previous works ( @xcite,@xcite-@xcite ) , from the part including the missing nuclear effects due to the nucleon momenta dependence of the nme to facilitate the comparisons and further applications .",
    "we compare our results with those obtained by brinkmann and turner ( @xcite ) for the nd limit , while for the degenerate regime we compare with those obtained in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) .",
    "the axion emission rate by nn bremsstrahlung is given by fermi s golden rule formula ( see for instance @xcite )    @xmath11 \\frac { d^3{\\bf p}_{a}}{(2 \\pi)^3 2e_a } e_a \\left({\\ s}\\times \\sigma { \\vert { m } \\vert}^2 \\right ) \\delta^4(p){\\it f(f ) } } \\eqno(1)\\ ] ]    where @xmath12 is the product of fermi - dirac distribution functions of the initial ( 1,2 ) and final ( 3,4 ) nucleons , @xmath13 .",
    "( 1 ) @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( i=1,4 ) are the nucleon momenta and energies , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the corresponding axion quantities ; _ s _ is a symmetry factor taking into account the identity of the particles ( 1/4 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 channels and 1 for the @xmath9 channel ) and @xmath20 are the chemical potentials of the nucleons .    in the non - relativistic limit @xmath21 .",
    "using the non - dimensional quantities @xcite @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 , the expressions of the fermi - dirac functions read @xmath25 .",
    "the degenerate ( d ) limit satisfies @xmath26 , while in the non - degenerate ( nd ) limit @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 we use the following expressions for the nuclear matrix elements ( in the opep approximation ) :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 @xmath31 is a dimensionless factor of order unity , which is model dependent , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking scale , @xmath34 represents the color anomaly of the peccei - quinn symmetry ) . for the @xmath18 and @xmath19 the momentum - dependent factors @xmath35 read    @xmath36 with @xmath37 ( @xmath38 being the coresponding unit vectors for *",
    "k * and * l * ) ,    while for the @xmath9 process @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the nucleon direct and exchange transfer momenta , respectively .",
    "the last ( exchange ) terms in the above expressions arise from interference of two different reaction amplitudes .",
    "they contain contributions from the scalar product @xmath41 , which have been estimated ( @xcite,@xcite ) by replacing them by their average values ( denoted by @xmath42 ) in the phase - space .",
    "there are two numerical values for @xmath42 in the literature : @xmath43 , in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath44 in ref .",
    "@xcite , but this difference ( explained by raffelt and seckel ) produces changes in our final results of only 1% . since we compare our results especially with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , we use that value for @xmath42 .",
    "thus , from kinematical constraints @xmath42 = 0 in the d regime , while it is @xmath45 in the nd regime ( see the expression above ) . we have used for the @xmath9 process , the nme of @xcite , with equal coupling constants for protons and neutrons .",
    "we follow the procedure of brinkmann and turner @xcite to derive the nd limit , by performing the transformation to the center - of - mass system @xmath46 @xmath47 from these relations and the conservation of momentum ( axion momentum is neglected ) we find @xmath48 .",
    "we define also the dimensionless quantities    @xmath49 @xmath50    from the definition of the @xmath51 variables above , and the conservation of energy , one can easily deduce the following relations @xmath52",
    "@xmath53    let us now address the ope potential .",
    "following the method used in our previous papers ( @xcite,@xcite ) , and after some lengthy algebra , one can express the matrix element @xmath54 ( eq.(4 ) ) in terms of the scalar combinations @xmath55 and @xmath56    the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 of eq.(10 ) are polynomials depending on the parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 and of variables @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( for their full expressions , see appendix a ) .",
    "also we used the notation @xmath64 , with @xmath65 the angle between the vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the contribution of nme is split into a constant term , obtained also by brinkmann and turner ( @xcite ) , raffelt and seckel(@xcite ) ) - which represents just its high - momentum limit ( i.e. the limit to which the expression ( 3 ) converges when the pion mass is neglected compared to the nucleon momentum transfer ) and a reduction term ( see appendix a ) to be evaluated . after an approximation which is numerically accurate within @xmath68 , we succeeded to integrate the expression of @xmath69 over the angles and finally we could express the axion emission rate in the nd limit in the following form    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the expression calculated by brinkmann and turner @xcite and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are double integrals over @xmath62 and @xmath63    @xmath74    @xmath75 @xmath76    with @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",

    "in performing the integrals over the momenta and energies , we used the method of integration adopted in refs.@xcite,@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the expressions of the emissivities are    @xmath86    where    @xmath87 or @xmath88 ( in natural units and @xmath89 )    with n = @xmath90 or @xmath91 , and    @xmath92    @xmath93    similar calculations for the @xmath9 process yields a final expression analogous to eq .",

    "@xcite ) , where @xmath96 , @xmath97 ,    and the correction integral @xmath98 @xmath99    with these expressions at hand , we discuss the results in next section .",
    "in figs . 1 and 2 we plotted the dependence on temperature of the relative corrections of the emissivities , @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 is the emissivity calculated in the high momentum limit - see ref .",
    "@xcite , while @xmath102 is the emissivity determined with our method ) , for nd regime ( fig .",
    "1 - @xmath103 processes and fig.2 - @xmath9 process ) due to pion mass effects ( see eqs . ( 11 ) , ( 17 ) ) .",
    "one observes that for this regime , the relative corrections to the previous results for the emissivities are quite important and temperature dependent . for all processes , the corrected emissivities are reduced with 30% to 85% , depending on temperature . figs .",
    "3 and 4 show the same relative emissivities , this time for the d regime ( fig .",
    "3 - @xmath103 processes and fig.4 - @xmath9 process ) . in this case , the corrected emissivities are reduced at most with 11% .",
    "so , for this regime the contributions from pion mass effects ( see eqs .",
    "( 20),(24 ) ) do not seriously affect the corresponding emission rates ( a result qualitatively reported in @xcite).the dependence of these corrections on temperature is smoother in this case than for the nd regime .",
    "for more confidence , we give in table 1 the absolute values for @xmath104 for nd and d regimes .",
    "we remark a very similar behaviour of the @xmath103 and @xmath9 relative corrections , for both regimes .",

    "in this paper we presented a method of determination of the nn axion - bremsstrahlung emissivities , for all processes , in both nd and d regimes , based on the inclusion of the full dependence of the nme on nuclear momenta .",
    "starting with the nd case , worked out for the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath9 cases , we found substantial reductions to the emissivities due to the combined effects of momentum - dependence in the temperature - dependent integrals - eqs .",

    "while these effects were somewhat foreseen in previous works ( @xcite ) , here we present an explicit calculation and quantitative results .",
    "we claim , based on the present results , that all axion mass limits that employed @xmath10 should be revised ( the ones used in numerical simulation supernova codes ) , especially those for which the nd limit is highly relevant , such as sn1987a neutrinos ( @xcite ) .",
    "as it stands , the suppression of @xmath10 can be important and this feature postpones one to obtain a firm bound on @xmath177 for both popular ksvz ( @xcite,@xcite ) and dsvz ( @xcite,@xcite ) axion models .",

    "we also mention that other nuclear effects like spin - density fluctuations ( @xcite,@xcite ) or short range effects ( tpep ) can further reduce the coresponding axion emissivities.we are currently calculating the nn axion - bremsstrahlung emissivities by including two pion exchange effects ( through a tpep ) that can be mimicked by the exchange of a @xmath178 meson ( @xcite ) .",
    "these effects are important at distances below 2 fm ( @xcite ) .",
    "preliminary results show us a further reduction of the axion emission rates compared with the case presented here .",
    "the calculations will be reported in a future paper . for the moment",
    "it is fair to point out that apparently minor sources of error become actually important for the problem , already at the ope approximation level , as explicitly shown above . also , it is worth to mention that our method might be used to improve calculations for other physical processes of neutrino and axion emission in ns , in which strong interactions are also involved .",
