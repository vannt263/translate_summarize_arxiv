    "in the last few years large extra dimensions and brane worlds have been the subject of intensive investigations .",
    "the situation can be simplified to a five - dimensional problem where matter fields are confined to the four - dimensional spacetime while gravity acts in five dimensions .",
    "if the extra dimension has a finite extension its compactification radius may be larger than the planck length without conflict with observations [ 1 ] .",
    "alternatively , the extra dimension may be kept warped and compactified or uncompactified [ 2,3 ] or even neither compact nor warped with a truly infinite size [ 4 ] .",
    "a considerable effort has been devoted in exploring possible phenomenological and observable consequences of the brane world scenario . in particular lorentzian wormholes [ 5,6 ] , smooth",
    "bridges connecting different universes or remote parts of the same universe , have gained much attention and have found a natural source in brane world models ( see [ 7 ] and references quoted therein ) . in this letter we will show that a solution to einstein equations in the randall - sundrum scenario with a mass point on the physical brane can describe a wormhole geometry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we start from the simplest form of the randall - sundrum model and modify the corresponding metric , which is asymptotically anti - de sitter , to a metric generated by a static , spherically symmetric distribution of matter on the physical brane or , equivalently , axially symmetric in the bulk . by a suitable choice of coordinates we succeed in reducing the solution of the five - dimensional einstein equations to the solution of a single ordinary differential equation in one unknown function . in section iii",
    "we solve numerically the highly nonlinear equation obtained and show that there are wormhole solutions in the brane world .",
    "some concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "there are in fact two models due to randall and sundrum with essentially the same framework . in the rs1 model [ 2 ]",
    "we have two 3-branes with equal and opposite tensions which rigidly reside at the boundaries ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) of a slab of a five - dimensional anti - de sitter bulk spacetime of radius @xmath2 .",
    "the five - dimensional einstein equations in the vacuum are @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote respectively the five - dimensional planck scale and the ( negative ) bulk cosmological constant .",
    "the randall - sundrum solution to the previous equations is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the flat minkowskian metric , and @xmath8 is a scale factor for the extra dimension @xmath9 .",
    "the above solution holds only if the tensions of the branes and the bulk cosmological term are fine - tuned and in particular this implies that @xmath10 must take the value @xmath11 .",
    "moreover the following relation is derived @xmath12 which gives a well defined value for the 4d planck scale @xmath13 even in the infinite radius limit .",
    "so if @xmath4 and @xmath10 are taken both of order @xmath13 and @xmath14 the model suggests a solution to the hierarchy problem by showimg that tev energy scales on the `` tev brane '' at @xmath15 correspond to @xmath16 tev energy scales on the `` planck brane '' at @xmath17 .",
    "in an alternate scenario known as rs2 [ 3 ] the second brane , where now is supposed to be concentrated the graviton zero mode , is taken off at infinity letting @xmath18 , while the standard model particles are assumed to live on the brane at @xmath17 . such localization of gravity",
    "can obviate the need for the compactification of the fifth dimension .",
    "rs2 does not solve the hierarchy problem as rs1 does , but it is of interest from a purely gravitational point of view . while in the absence of matter the line interval can be exactly obtained , complications arise in the presence of matter fields , and even if an analytic expression could be found for the metric produced by a matter distribution on the physical brane it certainly would involve special functions , as one can see in linear and beyond linear order approximate solutions [ 8,9,10 ] .",
    "here we assume for simplicity that the matter fields reduce to a point mass on the physical brane .",
    "having in mind the four - dimensional mcvittie solution [ 11 ] , which represents the gravitational field of a mass particle in a friedmann - robertson - walker universe and its generalization to higher dimensions [ 12 ] , we employ similar methods to obtain a solution although the metric we are searching for is not spherically symmetric in five dimensions .",
    "we start from the sourceless @xmath19 solution given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the line element on a two - dimensional sphere of unit radius , and apply to it the following transformation of the robertson type [ 13 ] @xmath22 so obtaining @xmath23 in the presence of a point mass @xmath24 bound at @xmath25 to the physical brane in the old coordinates and consequently bound at @xmath26 in the new coordinates , we make the _ ansatz _ that the line element ( 6 ) becomes @xmath27 in the above five - dimensional metric we used only four of the five available degrees of freedom , so ( 7 ) still has a degree of generality which can applied in future contexts . from einstein equations ( 1 ) , written in the mixed form @xmath28 we obtain , omitting for simplicity the @xmath29-dependence @xmath30 therefore putting @xmath31 one realizes by inspection that two of the components of the mixed einstein tensor , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are equal .",

    "in the same way equation ( 11c ) can be satisfied by @xmath41 but , apart the unpleasant fact that the standard radial coordinate should have the constant value @xmath42 , ( 11b ) becomes @xmath43 so can not be satisfied .",
    "finally the choice @xmath38 and @xmath44 is to be ruled out because it makes not soluble already the system ( 10 ) from which we started . as a consequence ( 11b ) and",
    "( 11c ) are both satisfied only by @xmath45 .",
    "the fact that now we are faced with the system ( 11a ) and ( 12 ) of two equations in the three unknown functions @xmath46 is not surprising because in writing the line element ( 7 ) we retained the possibility , due to the coordinate freedom of einstein equations , of still applying one degree of freedom so we can arbitrarily reduce the unknown quantities from three to two .",
    "a possible choice can be made exploiting the solutions to the system in some limiting cases . if @xmath47 and @xmath48 the solution is given by the line element ( 6 ) , while if @xmath49 and @xmath50 the solution has been investigated by various authors [ 14 - 17 ] and the corresponding line element , written in isotropic form , is given by @xmath51 the above line element was obtained in [ 17 ] as a solution to the five - dimensional einstein equations outside a static and three - dimensional spherically symmetric distribution of mass @xmath24 and scalar charge @xmath52 in equal amount and there it has been shown that it describes a lorentzian wormhole with throat at @xmath53 . now comparing the @xmath29-dependence of the coefficient multiplying @xmath54 in the line elements ( 6 ) and ( 13 ) , where respectively @xmath47 and @xmath50 , a suitable but of course not the only one choice for the function @xmath55 when both @xmath24 and @xmath10 are different from zero may be the following : @xmath56 so equation @xmath45 reduces to a second order differential equation , which for simplicity is not written here , in the unknown function @xmath57 and will be solved numerically . as to the boundary conditions for @xmath58 and its first derivative",
    ", they will be fixed once we know the behavior of @xmath57 when @xmath59 is sufficiently smaller than unity and both @xmath24 and @xmath10 are different from zero .",
    "this can be obtained from the equation @xmath60 inserting in it the expansion of @xmath61 in those conditions and solving by series the resulting differential equation for @xmath57 .",
    "we find , with the requirement that @xmath58 vanishes at infinity @xmath62 opposite to the case @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , now @xmath58 reaches its asymptotic value @xmath65 from below .",
    "in view of searching for a numerical solution we have to fix numerical values for the two parameters @xmath10 and @xmath24 . now in both the models of randall - sundrum one can derive from equation ( 3 ) the following relation between @xmath10 and the fundamental mass scales @xmath66 so with @xmath4 and @xmath10 taken , as in rs1 , of order @xmath67 , one obtains @xmath68 and since @xmath14 it follows that @xmath69 , so this is not a model with a large extra dimension .",
    "there are however various extensions of the generalized rs2 model ( see e.g. [ 18 ] and references quoted therein ) where the extra dimension is compact and much larger than planck scale . in any case experiments",
    "impose the bound @xmath70 , which implies @xmath71 , so we shall let @xmath10 to vary by many orders of magnitude . in searching for the numerical solution to equation @xmath60 we will pass to the adimensional variable @xmath72 and as a consequence in that equation @xmath24 and @xmath10 will appear only in the adimensional quantity @xmath73 , but clearly not all the possible combinations of @xmath24 and @xmath10 leading to the same value of @xmath73 are physically acceptable . as a numerical example if @xmath24 refers to the sun mass then @xmath74 and therefore @xmath75 .",
    "the precision of calculations were tested verifying the reproduced value of the quantity @xmath76 in the right - hand side members of einstein equations ( 10b ) and ( 10c ) in a wide range of the variable @xmath29 .",
    "the relative error proved to be a decreasing function of @xmath29 , some of its approximate values being @xmath77 at @xmath78 , @xmath79 at @xmath80 and @xmath81 at @xmath82 .    to discuss the numerical solution of equation ( 12 )",
    "let us consider the plots in figure 1 . in the case",
    "@xmath49 and @xmath50 the function @xmath83 , given now by equation ( 13 ) , goes to infinity as @xmath29 goes to @xmath84 and decreases to one as @xmath85 .",
    "if @xmath47 and @xmath48 one has @xmath86 from equation ( 6 ) .",
    "finally when both @xmath24 and @xmath10 are different from zero @xmath83 becomes again infinite at @xmath87 , reaches a minimum less than unity near @xmath88 then increases towards the asymptotical value @xmath89 .",
    "it is worth noticing that the last behavior is numerically the same , in the limit of machine - precision , for all the values of @xmath73 in the above considered range and this happens because the values @xmath90 make equation @xmath60 very weakly dependent on @xmath73 . as to the function @xmath35 given by equation ( 11a ) we found , using the calculated values of @xmath58 and for all values of @xmath73 as before , that it is positive when @xmath29 is greater than @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "our solution is therefore defined for @xmath93 . at @xmath94 the functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 are finite , different from zero and both much greater than unity",
    ". finally , for @xmath97 the function @xmath98 results decreasing and of order @xmath99 , except in the interval @xmath100 where it is slightly increasing .     for different values of the pair ( m , k ) .",
    "]     for different values of the pair ( m , k ) . ]    to see what is going on , look at the standard radial coordinate @xmath101 depicted in figure 2 for different values of the pair @xmath102 .",
    "the case @xmath90 we are treating here is similar to the case @xmath103 of equation ( 13 ) already discussed in [ 17 ] and will bring to analogous conclusions .",
    "more in detail , consider the proper circumference of radius @xmath29 given by @xmath104 .",
    "we have that @xmath105 becomes infinitely large as @xmath85 and asymptotically very large , mantaining however finite , as @xmath106 and has a minimum at @xmath107 .",
    "this numerical value was estimated plotting the derivative @xmath108 versus @xmath29 and looking at the value of @xmath29 where it vanishes .",
    "the regions @xmath109 and @xmath110 are two spacetimes associated with a wormhole whose throat occurs at @xmath42 where @xmath105 is minimum .",
    "the wormhole is in this case aymmetric under the interchange of the asymptotic surfaces ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) and traversable in principle due to the absence of event horizons .",
    "we verified numerically that the kretchmann invariant becomes infinity only at @xmath113 which is not part of the manifold .",
    "some remarks seem here to be appropriate .",
    "first , it is known that a wormhole geometry can appear only if some of the energy conditions are violated and this requires the presence of some amount of `` exotic '' matter .",
    "the violation could be justified incorporating the cosmological constant into an energy - momentum tensor describing the vacuum contribution to the density and pressure .",
    "however wormhole solutions can be obtained also with vanishing cosmological constant in a ricci flat spacetime , where energy conditions are trivially satisfied , of dimension @xmath114 as in [ 17 ] where it was shown that every time an extra dimension is reduced a massless scalar field appears and plays the role of `` exotic '' matter .",
    "also we would like to stress that in the framework of induced matter theory [ 19 ] the four - dimensional einstein equations with sources can be locally embedded in five - dimensional einstein equations without sources so although the matter seems exotic in four dimensions the five - dimensional spacetime on both sides of the throat is that of a vacuum and energy conditions are again trivially satisfied .",
    "second , according to the common assumption made both in brane world and in induced matter theories , our five - dimensional metric tensor depends explicitly on the fifth coordinate , as can best seen inverting transformation ( 5 ) and applying it to the line element ( 7 ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath115dr^2 + e^{\\overline{\\beta}}r^2",
    "d\\omega^2- \\dfrac{e^{\\overline{\\gamma}}}{(1 +   k^2r^2e^{-2k|y|})}dt^2\\big\\}\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\hspace{-0.5in}+\\big[e^{\\overline{\\alpha } } k^2r^2e^{-2k|y| } +   \\dfrac{e^{\\overline{\\gamma}}}{(1 + k^2r^2e^{-2k|y|})^2}\\big ] dy^2 + 2kr e^{-2k|y|}\\big[-e^{\\overline{\\alpha } } +   \\dfrac{e^{\\overline{\\gamma}}}{(1 + k^2r^2e^{-2k|y|})^2}\\big ] drdy \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 denote the functions @xmath119 , @xmath58 and @xmath120 written in the coordinates @xmath121 and @xmath9 . in this short letter",
    "we have not considered more general gauge transformations .",
    "further investigations should have to take into account , as pointed out in [ 20 ] , the influence that coordinate transformations may have on the interpretation of physical quantities in one lower dimension when in the reduced dimension is still present the extra coordinate .    00 n. arkani - hamed , s. dimopoulos , g. dvali , phys .",
