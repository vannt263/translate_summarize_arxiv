    "pulsar emission mechanism(s ) from radio to gamma - rays are poorly understood after 40yrs of work . yet despite this fact , pulsars are high - precision tools that probe a variety of topics in both fundamental physics and astrophysics .",
    "egret detected pulsed emission from at least 6 , and probably 7@xmath09 , young pulsars at energies @xmath1100mev @xcite .",
    "in addition , several tens of the ( primarily galactic ) unidentified egret sources are likely pulsars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with its much larger effective area and",
    "improved angular resolution , glast will almost certainly detect hundreds of pulsars .",
    "the majority of those pulsars will remain unidentified though ( and useless as physics tools ) , unless pulsations are detected through 1 ) `` folding '' of the events using timing ephemerides for known radio pulsars ; 2 ) searches of associated x - ray sources to find radio - quiet geminga - like pulsars @xcite , or very faint radio pulsars @xcite ; or 3 ) `` blind '' searches of the gamma - ray events @xcite .",
    "this paper discusses the latter , and perhaps most difficult , option .",
    "the known gamma - ray pulsars have similar characteristics ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "they are mostly non - variable sources with fairly flat energy spectra in the gamma - ray regime , but with spectral cutoffs around or just above 1gev .",
    "the flat energy spectra imply that most of the _ photons _ detected by the large area telescope ( lat ) will be in the @xmath2100 - 300mev range , where the point spread function has a width @xmath11@xmath3 .",
    "the gamma - ray pulse shapes are complex with two relatively sharp pulses which provide higher harmonic content in searches and make their detection easier .",
    "most of the glast mission will be spent in sky survey mode , where the whole sky is scanned every @xmath23 hours . on average , a point in the sky will be within the lat field of view @xmath4 of the time .",
    "pointed observations would increase this fraction to @xmath5 ( with earth occultations preventing higher on - source efficiency ) .",
    "this loss in efficiency due to scanning ( more specifically , the resulting decrease in the number of source events @xmath6 during a particular viewing period @xmath7 ) will make coherent pulsation searches considerably more difficult and less sensitive .",
    "blind searches of low count rate event data are typically conducted using either fourier techniques ( i.e.  binning events into a time series , computing one or more ffts , and analyzing the resulting amplitude and possibly phase spectra ; ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) or via brute - force epoch folding ( i.e.  assembling a pulse profile by determining the pulse phase of each event from a trial ephemeris and then computing a probability of non - uniformity for the profile ; ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optimal sensitivity to pulsations comes from searches that treat all of the data in a `` coherent '' fashion , meaning that the pulsar s rotational phase is accurately tracked over the full observation or analysis duration @xmath7 , from first event to last .     in hz )",

    "therefore , very long observations lasting from weeks to years are required to make significant detections . and unfortunately , young pulsars are notoriously badly behaved over such timescales .",
    "ideally , we would only need to search over the unknown spin frequency @xmath17 of a pulsar .",
    "however , young pulsars rapidly spin - down ( i.e.  have large frequency derivatives @xmath8 ) , they exhibit timing noise which manifests itself in searches as significant frequency 2@xmath9 derivatives @xmath10 ( and for the noisiest pulsars , many higher order derivatives as well ) , and they occasionally , on month or year timescales , `` glitch '' and instantaneously change their observed @xmath17 and @xmath8 .",
    "figure  1 shows the number of independent frequency bins of width @xmath18 in hz , corresponding to an accumulated phase error of one rotation , over which a pulsar signal will `` drift '' during a coherent search for a variety of realistic values of @xmath17 and @xmath10 .",
    "pulsar spin - down becomes important for energetic young pulsars in a day or two , and so all gamma - ray searches must account for an unknown @xmath8 .",
    "timing noise can become important after a few weeks or months .",
    "since gamma - ray pulse profiles contain sharp features , and therefore their pulsed signals contain many harmonics , search codes must significantly oversample the @xmath19 or @xmath20 spacings in @xmath17 and @xmath8 to maintain optimal sensitivity .    a potentially bigger problem , as shown by @xcite , are positional errors or uncertainties @xmath21 , which cause _ apparent _ changes in the observed spin frequency @xmath22hz , frequency derivative @xmath23hzs@xmath16 , and frequency 2@xmath9 derivative @xmath24hzs@xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the position error in milliradians",
    ", @xmath27 is the spin frequency in tens of hz , and @xmath28 is the time varying angle between the earth s velocity vector and the line of sight to the pulsar . for candidate glast pulsar sources , @xmath21 will be milliradians ( arcminutes ) in size , making the blind detection of even stable geminga - like pulsars much more difficult .",
    "_ the intrinsic @xmath8 , timing noise , glitch frequency , and position error effects place upper limits on the useful @xmath29 for coherent pulsation searches to durations as short as @xmath210days for the most energetic and active pulsars , or a few months for older , slower , and more stable pulsars . _ because of the scanning nature of the glast mission , there will be fewer counts accumulated for a particular source over the specified @xmath7 by a factor of @xmath23 as compared to a pointed observation .",
    "this decrease in accumulated counts per unit time greatly impacts coherent search sensitivity and is the reason why scanning is not the optimal observing mode for pulsar studies .",
    "the power @xmath30 in a periodic gamma - ray signal is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a pulse - shape dependent factor ( 0.4@xmath00.9 for the known gamma - ray pulsars)(e.g .",
    "the total number of events @xmath33 is the sum of the source ( pulsed ) events @xmath6 and background ( unpulsed ) events @xmath34 .",
    "probability _ that noise fluctuations produce a certain search power @xmath35 is _ exponentially _ related to the power : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the number of independent trials searched .",
    "@xmath37 is proportional to the range of @xmath17 and @xmath8 searched , but more importantly , to @xmath38 .",
    "in general then , to optimize search sensitivity , we want large @xmath6 to maximize @xmath30 , yet a relatively short @xmath7 ( appropriate for the limits discussed in the last section ) to reduce @xmath39 and the computational complexity .",
    "this rule exposes another problem for scanning - mode observations of pulsars : if @xmath40 is increased by a factor of @xmath23 to recover the events `` lost '' compared to a pointed observation ( assuming the pulsations remain well - behaved over the longer @xmath7 ) , a detected signal will have the same power as from the shorter pointed observation , yet the probability that the signal is significant will decrease by a factor of @xmath41 due to the larger @xmath37 searched .",
    "computationally , the complexity of epoch - folding searches scales roughly as @xmath42 ( i.e.  @xmath43 ) , while fft - based techniques fare slightly better and scale as @xmath44 .",
    "moderate sized computer clusters can currently handle epoch - folding searches of hundreds to thousands of events for viewing periods of up to several weeks ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "for longer @xmath7 or more limited computing resources , one can use evolutionary @xcite and/or heirarchical @xcite techniques to greatly reduce the computational burden of coherent searches without greatly impacting the overall sensitivity , _ if _ the average pulsation flux is time invariant",
    ". coherent searches with glast with @xmath45@xmath02months should be sensitive to pulsars with photon fluxes ( @xmath14100mev ) of a few times 10@xmath13 to a few times 10@xmath12photons@xmath15s@xmath16 for scanning - mode observations , or as low as @xmath22@xmath4610@xmath13photons@xmath15s@xmath16 for pointed observations .",
    "finally , incoherent searches are possible where the absolute phase of pulsations is _ not _ tracked over the full @xmath7 , but only over much shorter `` windows '' @xmath47 .",
    "incoherent searches are less sensitive than coherent ones for the same @xmath7 , but they use many fewer computing resources and enable searches with much longer @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the basic idea limits the duration of the coherently processed intervals @xmath47 such that a signal with any reasonable @xmath8 or @xmath10 stays within a single independent frequency bin ( of width @xmath48hz ) or fraction thereof .",
    "these windowed analyses are then combined without phase information , but with corrections for @xmath8 and/or @xmath10 effects occurring between the intervals , and analyzed .",
    "initial simulations show that one might detect _ relatively stable pulsars _ with photon fluxes ( @xmath14100mev ) as low as 1@xmath02@xmath4610@xmath13photons@xmath15s@xmath16 with @xmath49yr and @xmath50day . without phase information , however , the folding of all events over such long durations to accumulate high - quality pulse profiles may be difficult or even impossible .    in summary , instabilities of young pulsars , source positional uncertainties , and the default survey / scanning mode for the mission will make blind pulsation searches with glast much more difficult than early estimates had predicted .",
    "it is therefore likely that glast will blindly discover only tens of new pulsars rather than hundreds ."
