    "with an increasing population and with more cost effective transportation , mass gatherings become more frequent . the total size of such gatherings are often as large as millions of people , for example during the inauguration ceremony of president obama @xcite and the hajj pilgrimage to mecca @xcite .    to guarantee the safety of the participants during such large mass gatherings ,",
    "careful planning needs to be carried out by the organizer . during the last decades , numerous empirical studies @xcite have been performed on pedestrian crowds in different countries , in order to understand the dynamics of these crowds . even though an understanding of crowd dynamics is a prerequisite for being able to plan a mass gathering ,",
    "there is still no concensus on some of the most basic relations , such as how the flow of people ( people per meter per second ) depends on the crowd density ( people per m@xmath0 ) .",
    "misconceptions of these basic relations may result in serious safety risks during mass gatherings  @xcite .",
    "let us now start from the bottom up , and show how local interactions lead to certain flow - density relationships for the stream of pedestrians . since movement and avoidance patterns of pedestrians tend to be rather complex , the traditional way to reduce complexity",
    "is to find a relation of the flow @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) as a function of the average density @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) . using this relation , called the _ fundamental diagram _",
    ", has been successful to some extent , but unfortunately there are large variations of these relations , among empirical studies carried out in different countries .",
    "all these studies agree on that walking speed of pedestrians is a decreasing function of density , but they disagree on how this function looks like .",
    "we will now demonstrate how the net - time headway , as a result of finite reaction times , is the key mechanism which can explain the discrepancies between data sets from different studies .",
    "it is known from traffic science that finite reaction times are needed to explain instabilities in traffic flows @xcite . for pedestrian - flow dynamics",
    ", the role of finite reaction times has not been investigated in detail . by doing so",
    ", it turns out that the finite reaction time gives rise to a certain net - time headway , which is needed as a safety headway , to prevent accidental physical encounters with surrounding pedestrians .",
    "many - particle simulations @xcite coupled with empirical pedestrian - trajectory data @xcite reveal the probability - density function of delay times @xmath5 from a walking experiment @xcite where two pedestrian streams are intersecting at a @xmath6 angle .",
    "the resulting distribution of delay times are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_delays ] .",
    "interestingly , the probability - density function of the delay curve is bi - modal .",
    "the first peak occurs at lower times than the typical response times , to visual or acoustic cues @xcite .",
    "therefore , this peak must correspond to _ anticipated _ movements of the surrounding pedestrians .",
    "the second peak at around 0.45 s occurs at times which are significantly larger than the previously mentioned response times , but also lower than response times involving conscious reactions @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this second peak corresponds to an unconscious response , which is more complex than a simple reaction .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that reactions where there are more than one possible response ( choice reaction time ) as well as reactions to more complex cues ( recognition reaction time ) take significantly longer time @xcite .",
    "we interpret the bi - modality as follows : when the surrounding pedestrians act in a way that is easy to predict , extrapolation allows to anticipate their behaviors , while a delayed reaction results in cases of unexpected behaviors .    .",

    "these models are able to reproduce various self - organization phenomena , such as lane and stripe formation @xcite , freezing by heating @xcite , mexican waves in excitable media @xcite , intermittent outflows @xcite , stop - and - go waves and crowd turbulence @xcite .    when measuring empirical pedestrian flows and densities and then fitting a suitable curve to the data , one obtains a function which is useful for engineering involved in planning of pedestrian facilities .",
    "this pragmatic fit curve , however , does not provide any insight into the mechanisms and dynamics behind the pedestrian interactions and behaviours , leading to the aggregated data .    however , when plotting the fundamental diagrams obtained in various empirical studies ( fig .",
    "[ fd_and_headways ] ( top ) ) , one can see that each of the curves has a similar parabola - like shape .",
    "nevertheless , the curves are quite different from one measurement site to another .",
    "one question remains to be answered : _",
    "what , if any , is the common underlying principle of these curves ? _    in an attempt to bridge this knowledge gap , let us come back to the issue of reaction times , mentioned before .",
    "since pedestrians have a typical reaction time @xmath5=0.45 s to unexpected behaviors of surrounding pedestrians , it would be natural that they compensate the risk of bumping into others , by keeping a certain safety time headway to the surrounding pedestrians .     and the closest surrounding pedestrian @xmath7 , as a function of global ( average ) crowd density @xmath3 .",

    "_ hypothesis 2 _ : if the space in front of a pedestrian is too small ( or the velocity is too low ) it will no longer be possible to take normal steps . rather , pedestrians will completely stop until they have gained enough space to make a step .    in previous work",
