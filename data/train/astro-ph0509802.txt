    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are two broad classes of interacting binary star , whose emission , from x - ray through optical / ir ( and even radio ) , is powered by accretion onto a compact object ( white dwarf or neutron star / black hole respectively ) .",
    "there are good reviews of the various sub - classes and general characteristics in @xcite , and @xcite respectively .",
    "when actively accreting , both classes exhibit ( broad ) emission line spectra , with very blue continua ( from the accretion disk ) , but are normally distinguished by their relative x - ray output ; their x - ray luminosity roughly scales as @xmath13 , i.e. a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "however , in many cases the accretion rate onto the compact object is highly variable , with both cvs and lmxbs exhibiting a variety of brightness states .    for the past three years",
    ", we have used _ xmm - newton _  to study and confirm potential magnetic cvs identified in the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "two sdss sources stood out based on the unusual strength of their he emission lines , as well as on the double - peaked character of all their lines .",
    "these are sdss  j102347.67 + 003841.2 @xcite and sdss  j093249.57 + 472523.0 @xcite .",
    "sdss  j102347.67 + 003841.2 = first j102347.6 + 003841(hereafter sdss  j1023 ) was identified as a cv , from its radio emission in the first radio survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , the first cv to be so discovered ) , and independently from its color and emission line spectrum in the sdss . in both cases , a highly magnetic white dwarf was suggested to account for the high - excitation optical emission lines and detectable radio emission .",
    "the nature of the lines appeared more consistent with an intermediate polar ( ip ) , since they lacked both the large equivalent widths and narrow components usually seen in polars .",
    "significant changes in state have been postulated to account for : ( i ) very different optical photometric behaviour seen by @xcite and later @xcite , a change from pure flickering behaviour to a smooth periodic modulation on a period of 4.75 hr ; ( ii ) significant color changes between the sdss photometry ( when it appeared red ) to the later sdss spectroscopy , showing a very blue continuum .",
    "most recently , @xcite ( hereafter ta05 ) presented the results of a photometric and spectroscopic campaign , which have called into question whether sdss  j1023  is a cv , or a lmxb instead .",
    "the low - state spectrum reveals a mid - g star , unlike either previous spectral observation .",
    "multi - color photometry showed a smooth orbital modulation similar to @xcite , with color changes consistent with the changing aspect of the heated face of the secondary , but even at maximum light no emission lines are present in the spectrum .",
    "modelling of the light curves , together with the radial velocity constraints , indicates that a high primary mass ( greater than the chandrasekhar mass ) is needed , thus making sdss  j1023  a lmxb .",
    "we obtained x - ray , circular polarization and other optical data to further elucidate the nature of this source .",
    "for sdss  j0932  we also obtained contemporaneous optical light curves , spectra and x - ray / optical data from _ xmm - newton _ in an attempt to discern its nature and possible relation to sdss  j1023 .",

    "in the direct ( spectro)imaging epic detectors count rates were sufficient for extraction of low - resolution spectra and light curves .",
    "we followed the standard protocol as given by the vilspa _ xmm - newton _  science analysis system ( sas ) site and the abc guide from the us gof . in both cases we used calibration files current to 2005",

    "no hard x - ray flaring events were present in the data , and for sdss  j1023  we simply used the standard good time intervals ( gtis ) .",

    "for the pn it is possible to make some improvements to reduce this detector background ; we followed the guidelines in sas handbook section 4.3.2.1 `` improving the quality of epic pn data : epreject . ''",
    "next , we created background light curves to examine any variations at these specific energies , and identified one interval of especially high flux , and created new gtis to exclude it .",
    "in addition to the time selection , we screened the event lists using the standard canned expressions and restricted energies to the 0.110  kev range . owing to the very different count rates",
    ", we used different extraction radii for each source .",
    "for sdss  j0932  we used circular source apertures of radius 320  pixel ( mos ) and 360  pixel ( pn ) , in each case enclosing @xmath23 of the energy , chosen to maximize s / n . for sdss  j1023  we increased the radii to 480 and 640  pix respectively , now enclosing @xmath24 of the energy .",
    "for the background , we selected annuli on the same chip for the mos , and adjacent rectangular regions at similar detector y locations to the target for the pn , excluding any point sources .",
    "as advised we selected single to quadruple events for the mos ( pattern @xmath25 12 ) , but only singles from the pn ( pattern = 0 ) .",
    "using the same extraction regions for source and background we extracted their light curves with sas task evselect . in this instance",
    "( to maximise counts ) we included both singles and doubles from the pn ( pattern@xmath26 ) .",
    "finally , background subtraction ( scaled by extraction area ) and correction of the time stamps to the heliocenter ( times in hjd(tt)3  s at any given time , fine for our purposes here .",

    "after its x - ray observations ( 2005 may 13 ) a similar time series was taken on sdss  j1023 .",
    "circular spectropolarimetry and spectrophotometry was also obtained for sdss  j1023  with the ccd spectropolarimeter spol ( schmidt et al . 1992 ) in 2002 may on the 2.3  m kitt peak bok telescope and on the 6.5  m mmt in 2004 february , as indicated in table 1 . at both epochs ,",
    "the object displayed the spectrum of a g star , with apparent magnitudes of 17.9 and 17.5 , respectively .",
    "the 20  min observation sequences revealed no significantly polarized features , and respective upper limits are @xmath30% and 0.03% when summed over the spectrum .",
    "we also observed both sdss  j0932  and sdss  j1023  on 2005 may 23 with the double - imaging spectrograph ( dis ) with a resolution of about 2  on the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5 m ( see fig .  [",

    "both our optical curves indicate a broad ( @xmath50.3 in phase ) constant flux interval at maximum light , followed by a smooth rounded minimum .",
    "excellent agreement is seen for the phasing of minimum light ( posited as superior conjunction of the donor ) ; 574 cycles have elapsed between the ta05 ephemeris and our epoch of observation , giving a phase uncertainty of merely 0.006 . fitting a gaussian to the minimum in the 2004 may 13 nofs lightcurve we determine @xmath31 , giving @xmath32d , and a refined ephemeris of : @xmath33    note our ephemeris is given in terrestrial time (=",

    "the x - ray light curve does not show a similar smooth modulation , but instead is quite irregular .",
    "indeed , the amplitude of its variability ( peak - peak ) amounts to about 60% , greater than the 40% in @xmath27 or 30% in white light . in view of the ip nature hypothesis",

    "we also double - checked our results using @xmath835 counts / bin , and fitting simultaneous source and background spectra using cash statistics ; in all cases the results were consistent with the @xmath84 approach .",
    "a variety of models were fit to the data , starting with simple single component plus interstellar absorbing column ( see table .  [ tab:1023xfits ] ) .",
    "in general the emission of cvs can be approximated with a thermal plasma .",
    "we performed fits setting @xmath85 @xmath7 , the maximum galactic column as derived from dust maps ( using heasoft tool nh ) or a fiducial @xmath86 @xmath7 , appropriate for such a high galactic latitude source , and lastly with this parameter free .",
    "a high temperature ( @xmath87kev ) thermal plasma ( either bremsstrahlung , or bremsstrahlung plus lines mekal ) can produce an acceptable fit ( see fig .  [ fig:1023xspec ] ) but only with the lower column option ( leaving the column free yielded only an upper limit of @xmath88 @xmath7 , but was consistent with zero ) .",
    "the best fit was a simple power law with @xmath89 for either fixed column , and photon index of 1.31.5 ( also see fig .",

    "is suggestive of that found for the hard component of lmxbs in quiescence ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moving onto more complex models , we examined two temperature and multi - temperature mekal ( xspec : cemekl ) models  used to fit ip spectra , and lastly a soft blackbody + mekal as for a polar .",
    "a two temperature fit was possible , but in the case of the low column the higher temperature mekal pegged at its upper limit of 80 kev , whilst the cool plasma settled at 100300 ev .",
    "the data were not suitable to constrain the cemekl model at all .",
    "adding in a soft blackbody to a mekal fit has a similar effect as the two temperature model .",
    "we found well - constrained @xmath91 and 220 ev respectively for the high and low column cases , but in both cases @xmath92kev ( pegged ) .",
    "this compares to a typical polar fit with @xmath530ev and 30 kev for these components .    on the other hand",
    "if sdss  j1023  is a lmxb , then we might expect a good fit for the typical two component neutron star atmosphere ( nsa ) plus power law model .",
    "fixing both the neutron star radius and mass at their canonical 10 km and 1.4  values , the only free parameters left in the nsa model are the distance and temperature .",
    "ta05 provide a constraint on the distance to sdss  j1023 depending on the mass of the secondary .",
    "we investigated fits for a range of masses / distances from 0.1 ( 1.0 kpc ) to 1.2(2.3 kpc ) .",
    "statistically acceptable fits are found for all distances , although in all cases only for a higher column @xmath93 @xmath7 .",
    "however , especially for @xmath94 kpc , but also for the longer distances , the effective temperature of the nsa is low , and in all cases it contributes merely @xmath510% of the flux , even including energies down to 0.01 kev .",
    "if one performs an @xmath95-test to compare the best fit pl ( which has a low column ) to the best fit pl+nsa ( which requires a higher column ) , the low value indicates that there is no need for the inclusion of the soft component to model the data ; but of course this all depends on the actual column .    in general ,",
    "the quality of the fits is fairly similar and each yields an unabsorbed 0.0110 kev x - ray luminosity of @xmath3 .",

    "the data seem best fit with a power law , but this is far from conclusive .",
    "the observational constraints supplied by our new optical and especially x - ray data lend significant support to the lmxb hypothesis of ta05 .",
    "the 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity of sdss  j1023  is @xmath142  assuming a distance of 2 kpc , which places it squarely in the range of luminosities for neutron star lmxbs in quiescence ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , in this energy range the flux is dominated ( 97% ) by the hard power law component .",
    "recently , @xcite examined the relation between the x - ray luminosity of neutron star transients in quiescence and the fractional contribution of the power law component .",
    "they found a correlation for @xmath143 , and an anti - correlation for lower luminosities . with its relatively low luminosity sdss",
    "j1023  lies at the top end of the anti - correlation having a negligible nsa contribution , similar to both the lmxb in terzan 5 and the millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 in quiescence . in the pulsar , the leading model for the power law component",
    "is the interaction of the pulsar wind with that from the donor star @xcite , but as yet there is no clear origin for the case of weakly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "since sdss  j1023  has not been observed with a large area x - ray detector , such as the _ rxte _ , during an outburst , we have no constraints on its pulsed x - ray emission ; it is interesting to speculate that it too may host a millisecond pulsar .",
    "another notable feature of sdss  j1023  is its short timescale ( i.e. @xmath510 s of minutes ) x - ray variability ; again this is somewhat unusual , but not without precedent , for example cen x-4 and exo 1745 - 248 @xcite . as for the spectral parameters themselves : with @xmath144 ev it is lower than for most quiescent lmxbs ( i.e. 100300 ev ) , but fits in with the trend for those systems with very weak nsa components ; the photon index@xmath145 lies well within the normal 12 range .",
    "lastly , now that we have a measure of the quiescent x - ray luminosity , we can consider how much brighter it may have become during its active state ( outburst ) , and consider its detectability during previous x - ray observations .",
    "a search of the heasarc archives yields no previous pointed observations by other x - ray satellites .",
    "naturally , its position was covered by both the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ) and the _ rxte_/asm , though in neither has it been detected .",
    "the null result for rass ( upper limit of 0.03 counts / s ) is consistent with our _ xmm - newton _  flux measures : we predict merely 0.015 counts / s in the rass 0.52.5 kev band .",
    "however , the fact that sdss  j1023  remained undetected by the asm even during its bright phase can provide a useful constraint .",
    "the nominal asm point source sensitivity is @xmath146 , hence sdss  j1023  could have brightened by a factor @xmath52000 and still remained undetected by the asm .",
    "such a brightening is well - within the wide spread seen amongst x - ray transients .",
    "in addition to the x - ray , we can examine its activity history via a number of optical observations .",
    "catalog data provide snapshots of its state at their epochs of observation .",
    "we have four independent data points spanning 1952 to 2000 , and in each case the approximate @xmath27 and @xmath147 magnitudes show the source to be quiescent .",
    "furthermore , all observations since the late 2000/early 2001 epoch of the sloan spectroscopy and the bond et al .",
    "series of observations show the source to be quiescent .",
    "it therefore appears that sdss  j1023  has a low - duty cycle of activity , which is seen in many other x - ray transients , and moreover , fits in with a low - temperature and luminosity from the neutron star atmosphere .    in summary",
    ", we can argue that all observations to date find a system with characteristics and behaviour fully consistent with a lmxb , which spends most of its time in quiescence .    for the cv alternative",
    ", we immediately run into problems : what provides its x - ray emission in such a quiescent state ?",
    "a number of cvs are observed to enter very low states , optically up to @xmath57 mags fainter than normal : the vy scl stars .",
    "however , they spend the majority of their time in active states .",
    "only one ip has been observed to transition into such a very low - state , v1223 sgr @xcite , in a survey of the harvard plate collection , hence nothing more is known about its characteristics in that state .",
    "physically , in the absence of mass transfer onto a white dwarf , the only plausible source of x - rays appears to be the chromospheric emission of the fast - rotating donor : as is the presumed case for sdss  j155331.12 + 551614.5 @xcite .",
    "but for sdss  j1023 , this option is inconsistent with the hardness of its x - ray spectrum .",
    "all active binaries when fit with optically thin thermal emission models yield temperature @xmath148 kev ( see results from chandra observations of 47 tuc and from the rass : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , not @xmath149 kev as we find .",
    "moreover , the ratio of x - ray to optical flux is far greater than for any of the rass or 47 tuc active binaries .",
    "although the rough @xmath150 magnitudes of sdss  j0932  ( 6 epochs- sdss photometry through _ xmm - newton _  observations ) do vary , they differ by much less than a magnitude , which is likely due to random sampling of the eclipses in some of the longer exposures . with no clear evidence of significant state changes ( unlike sdss  j1023 ) a transiently accreting lmxb ( or dwarf nova )",
    "model seems less favored . in any case",
    "the high excitation lines of its optical spectra suggest either an active lmxb or magnetic cv .",
    "furthermore , the high x - ray column ( and partial covering model ) further restrict the options to either a high - inclination lmxb or most likely an ip .",
    "as we noted , from the x - ray spectral fits alone it is hard to choose between these competing interpretations .",
    "hence , we have also compared the x - ray to optical flux ratio of sdss  j0932  to those of all known ips and to a sample of 8 high inclination lmxbs with periods less than 10 hrs . clearly , the exact details of x - ray spectrum , and the galactic absorption are not taken out in these estimates",
    ". nevertheless , if we normalize our values such that sdss  j0932  has @xmath151 we find it fits well within the scatter of values for ips , which range from 0.1 to 10 , though clustered in the 12 range .",
    "in contrast , most of the high inclination ( actively accreting ) lmxbs have @xmath152 ; low for lmxbs because the disk obscures much of the direct x - ray flux , but still orders of magnitude higher .",
    "the absence of a firm detection of additional periodicities in the optical light curve leaves the ip candidacy of sdss  j0932  very much a matter of debate .",
    "there is also our tentative detection of a photometric variation a few percent longer than the orbital period , which would be difficult to explain in an ip .",
    "much more extensive optical photometric monitoring is without doubt required to resolve these two issues .",
    "we have obtained _ xmm - newton _  x - ray and additional optical followup observations of two accreting binaries recently discovered in the sdss : sdss  j1023  and sdss  j0932 .",
    "consideration of their optical spectra and magnitudes ( and history thereof ) suggests that we observed sdss  j1023  during its ( normal ) inactive state , while sdss  j0932  was actively accreting at the time .",
    "for sdss  j1023  the x - ray results favor the ( transient ) lmxb hypothesis of @xcite , both in terms of x - ray luminosity , spectral parameters and the relative contributions of the best fit neutron star atmosphere + power law model .",
    "the distance independent x - ray - to - optical flux ratio and the estimated range of x - ray luminosities are inconsistent with what we would expect from an inactive cv , i.e. the chromospheric emission from the low - mass donor star .",
    "our two epochs of time - series optical photometry confirm that sdss  j0932  is indeed a high inclination system , exhibiting deep eclipses on a period of 1.57 hr .",
    "unfortunately , given the very low x - ray count rate of sdss  j0932  we are unable to construct a useful x - ray light curve .",
    "neither are we able to constrain the emission model well _ but _ our x - ray spectra clearly require significant local absorption .",
    "this could be accounted for in either an intermediate polar or high inclination lmxb model .",
    "we find that its x - ray - to - optical flux is fully consistent with the known ips , but at least an order of magnitude less than that of the x - ray faintest lmxb .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for their timely and helpful report .",
