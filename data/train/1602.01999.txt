    "some of the key issues related with magnetic reconnection are :    1 .",
    "how does fast magnetic reconnection occur and what determines the reconnection rate ?",
    "two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of _ coronal _ magnetic reconnection show that the reconnection rate depends strongly on the resistivity model @xcite . in the case of uniform resistivity ,",
    "the reconnection becomes steady sweet  parker type , while in the case of anomalous resistivity , the reconnection tends to non - steady petschek type .",
    "apart from the anomalous resistivity , the hall effect also plays an important role in facilitating the fast reconnection .",
    "@xcite . it is however not clear whether the hall effect and anomalous resistivity operate and interact simultaneously in an astrophysical environment .",
    "the anomalous resistivities required to explain the fast reconnection rate are @xmath0 localized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", how can one reconcile the enormous gap between macroscopic scales ( e.g. solar flares @xmath1 km ) and microscopic scales required to explain the reconnection rate ?",
    "3 .   how does magnetic reconnection occur in partially ionized , highly _",
    "the solar chromosphere is partially ionized and fully collsional .",
    "anomalous resistivity appears in a collisionless plasma , but , because of the incredibly small scales with which it is associated , it is quite unlikely that it will play a role in the solar chromosphere . the importance of partially ionized plasma on magnetic reconnection in solar chromosphere is realized in some of the recent studies @xcite .",
    "the multi - fluid mhd simulations of solar chromosphere have shown faster reconnection rates , compared to the single - fluid sweet  parker prediction , and during the process of decoupling the recombination as well as the plasma outflow play a role in determining the reconnection rate @xcite .",
    "the 2.5d mhd simulations of magnetic reconnection including the ambipolar diffusion and radiative cooling in the partially ionized solar chromosphere have been performed @xcite .",
    "it has been found that fast magnetic reconnection develops as a consequence of the plasmoid instability and there is no need to invoke anomalous resistivity .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a non - linear model of magnetic reconnection in partially ionized plasma . recent observation of multiple plasma ejections in chromospheric anemone jets by @xcite has shown a strongly time - dependent as well as the intermittent nature of magnetic reconnection in the solar chromosphere . in this paper , we argue that as the magnetic reconnection in a sweet  parker current sheet with a large aspect ratio goes through various regimes ( strongly coupled , intermediate and weakly coupled or decoupled ) in a partially ionized plasma and the reconnection will be plasmoid - induced , fast and fractal - like .",
    "the solar chromosphere is a favorable site for magnetic reconnection to occur , since the ohmic resistivity is greatest in that region  especially at the location of the temperature - minimum @xcite . in a partially ionized plasma ,",
    "the collisions between electron - ion , electron - neutral and ion - neutral takes place .",
    "the electron - ion and electron - neutral collisions produce an ohmic diffusion @xcite .",
    "in addition to the ohmic diffusion , the hall drift and the ambipolar diffusion also appears in a partially ionized plasma . in the case of solar chromosphere , the hall effect can often be ignored @xcite .",
    "the role of ambipolar diffusion has been studied analytically in the context of magnetic reconnection .",
    "it has been found that in a sweet  parker geometry , the ambipolar diffusion increases the reconnection rate @xcite .",
    "some of the observations of magnetic field in the solar chromosphere suggest that reconnection can occur at speeds @xmath2 0.1 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recent high - resolution observations of jets in the solar chromosphere show a strongly time - dependent and intermittent nature of magnetic reconnection in the solar chromosphere .",
    "it was for the first time that @xcite , based on the observations of multiple plasma ejections in the chromospheric anemone jets , suggested that if a time - dependent and bursty reconnection occurs 10 times longer than the alfvn time scale , it can then naturally explain the observed intermittency of one to two minutes in the chromospheric jets .",
    "as a result of the ambipolar diffusion , the dissipation of currents is increased manifold compared to the standard ohmic dissipation .",
    "the ambipolar diffusion can also contribute in the chromospheric heating and therefore the ambipolar diffusion should be included in the non - linear mhd simulations of chromospheric heating @xcite .",
    "it is known that in a partially ionized plasma , a current sheet undergoes thinning and enters a regime where the neutrals decouple from ions @xcite",
    ". the strength of coupling between ion and neutrals in a partially ionized plasma can affect the reconnection rate and during the process of decoupling the reconnection rate could increase .",
    "the alfvn speed in a decoupled regime is defined with respect to the ion mass density alone @xcite .",
    "the multi - fluid mhd simulations show that , as a result of current sheet thinning and elongation , a critical lundquist number ( @xmath4 ) is reached in a partially ionized plasma and the plasmoid formation starts @xcite . during the current sheet thinning a stage is reached where the neutrals and ions decouple , and reconnection rate faster than the single - fluid sweet  parker prediction is observed in such multi - fluid simulations . the ion and neutral outflows",
    "are well coupled in the multi - fluid mhd simulations in the sense that the difference between ion and neutral outflow is negligible compared to the magnitude of the ion outflow .",
    "the breakup of sweet  parker current sheets with large aspect ratios and formation of plasmoids as a result of the tearing mode instability appears to be a generic feature of the reconnecting systems @xcite .",
    "there are number of theoretical studies on tearing mode instability that show the dependence of the growth rate of the instability on the ion - neutral collisions @xcite , the flows @xcite , the hall drift @xcite , and the two - fluid effects @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the role of ion - neutral collisions on tearing mode instability and fractal - like reconnection .",
    "the growth rate ( @xmath5 ) of tearing mode instability depends upon the extent of coupling and partial ionization in a partially ionized plasma as @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the growth rate of tearing mode instability in a plasma where the alfvn time is defined with respect to ions and the diffusion time includes ohmic diffusivity , @xmath8 is the neutral - ion collision frequency , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the neutral and ion mass densities respectively . for @xmath11 , there exists a strongly coupled regime in a partially ionized gas .",
    "apart from the strongly coupled regime , there exists an intermediate regime and a decoupled regime @xcite .",
    "while deriving the dispersion relation in a partially ionized plasma [ i.e. equation ( 1 ) ] , the effect of shear flows is not included . in general , we expect that various regimes would arise during the current sheet thinning in the presence of multi - fluid physics , ionization , recombination and heating processes . in what follows ,",

    "this happens in on the 12th - tearing , after which the system approaches the kinetic scales . in all cases",
    "it is very interesting to note that for the lower ion alfvn velocities ( implying either higher ionisation fraction or a lower magnetic field strength ) the fast reconnection regime is not achieved .",
    "it is possible to determine if a system can reach the the kinetic scale purely by assessing the asymptotic limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq44 ] ) , i.e. : @xmath134 therefore , to reach the kinetic scales found at @xmath135 , we require @xmath136 or a lundquist number of @xmath137 . for the resistivity and current sheet length used in the paper we require an ion alfvn velocity of @xmath138cms@xmath56 and @xmath62@xmath63s@xmath56 .",
    "this naturally places a strong constraint on the particular chromospheric conditions where fast reconnection can occur , with the general implication that a strong magnetic field is a necessary requirement to achieve this .",
    "it is also important to note the importance of the factor @xmath139 found in a ( see eq .",
    "[ a_eq ] ) plays an important role in this limit , i.e. the factor is equal to @xmath140 . in other works ,",
    "e.g. @xcite , this factor is taken as @xmath141 which would result in a factor of @xmath142 reduction in the limit given by equation [ limit ] .",
    "in this analysis , we have assumed that the initial current sheet width is given by the sweet  parker scaling . however , when we consider ion - neutral drift , it is possible that the current sheet will undergo thinning as a result of the neutrals leaving the current sheet before reconnection takes place .",
    "in fact , this drift velocity in the current sheet was estimated to be approximately @xmath143  kms@xmath56 by @xcite .",
    "there are a number of simple ways with which the new current sheet width can be estimated , and we provide a few of these here .    at first",
    "we try to find out the width of the current sheet at the point where the ambipolar diffusion balances the ohmic diffusion .",
    "this is given by the following equation : @xmath144 for some distance from the centre of the current sheet ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the magnetic field takes the distribution of @xmath146 , therefore we have : @xmath147 implying that @xmath148 this new current sheet width @xmath145 can be seen as analogous to the new current sheet width found for the kippenhahn - schlter prominence model by @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that there exists a weak guide field component in the centre of the current sheet . in this case",
    "the ambipolar diffusion squeezes the current sheet until this guide field becomes strong enough to support it , this was numerically investigated by @xcite . in this case we are looking for a balance between the external magnetic field ( @xmath149 ) and the guide field after it has undergone compression to @xmath150 . through flux conservation , the original guide field ( @xmath151 ) roughly relates to ( @xmath150 ) in the following way : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the original width of the current sheet .",
    "as we need the point were @xmath154 we get : @xmath155 this estimate can be seen as consistent with the thinning found in the numerical experiments as shown in figure 12 of @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the nature of the equation for the current sheet width at the n - th tearing ( eqs .",
    "13 , 27 and 44 ) implies that we do not have to be overly concerned about the initial width of the current sheet from the point of view of whether or not we can have fast reconnection . as eq .",
    "33 , in the limit of @xmath156 , becomes @xmath157 , which is independent of the initial current sheet width . to state this simply , reaching the decoupling length scale is independent of the initial current sheet width .",
    "it does , however , play a role in determining how many levels of tearing are necessary to reach this width , and so may be important for speeding up the process of reaching the decoupling length scale .",
    "the multi - fluid , two - dimensional mhd simulation in a harris type current sheet shows fast reconnection and plasmoid formation in the solar chromosphere @xcite .",
    "it is noticed in the simulations that as a result of current sheet thinning and elongation , the plasmoid instability in the mhd simulation starts when the aspect ratio (= @xmath158 ) approaches 200 and the @xmath159 @xcite .",

    "the maximum growth rate of tearing mode in @xcite scales with lundquist number as @xmath179 where @xmath180 , and the corresponding wave number scales as @xmath181 .",
    "it should be noted here that the scalings based on fkr theory ( without including effect of shear flow ) on sweet ",
    "parker current sheet leads to the scaling laws that are consistent with @xcite , so a simple application of @xcite would provide correct answer to the problem .",
    "the formation of plasmoids and its ejection from the long and thin current sheet lead to a nonlinear instability and fractal like reconnection . the current sheet thickness ( @xmath182 )",
    "is shown in the n - th secondary tearing for the intermediate and the decoupled regimes .",
    "the relevant time scales of fractal tearing are also calculated for an intermediate coupling and decoupled case in partially ionized plasma .",
    "the tearing mode time scale ( @xmath70 ) could lie between 10 s - 150 s ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "this gives @xmath183 between 6 s - 90 s in the decoupled regime .",
    "it is clear that although the main energy release is explained by the fast reconnection , the plasmoid induced instability and fractal tearing can produce a very thin current sheet in a partially ionized plasma .",
    "the shift in the regimes from strongly coupled to weakly coupled is one of the important component in the fast magnetic reconnection in partially ionized plasma . as a result of",
    "the plasmoid mediated processes in a partially ionized plasma , there could be few more regimes that will bring the scale down to ion - skin depth or ion - larmor radius due to the hall or kinetic effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as is clear from figure [ fig3 ] , it is not necessarily the case that reconnection occurring in a partially ionized plasma will reach the kinetic scale .",
    "in fact , we have been able to estimate the required lundquist number ( based on the ion alfvn velocity ) for kinetic scales to be reached as @xmath184 , i.e. this is the @xmath185 required to allow the tearing instability to still be important down to kinetic scales . when it is possible to reach these small scales due to multiple tearings , the reconnection has to pass through three distinct regimes : the coupled regime , the intermediate regime and the decoupled regime .",
    "as the decoupling of the alfvn waves happens before the decoupling of the instability , it can be expected that the reconnection dynamics undergoes multiple transitions .",
    "it is worth noting that there is another scale that we have not considered here , the hall lengthscale , which is related to the lengthscale at which ions become demagnetised .",
    "we plan to investigate how the inclusion of hall physics influences the cascade we describe in a future work .",
    "the passage through reconnection regimes will be characterised by the development of the decoupling of the neutrals from the reconnection dynamics , first by decoupling from the plasma then the plasma decoupling from the neutrals .",
    "this does not mean that that these neutrals are never to feel the ions again , on the contrary the ions will recouple to the neutrals and even then later the neutrals will recouple to the plasma as the reconnected plasma is ejected from the current sheet and starts an inverse cascade , partially through plasmoid merger , to connect to the global reconnection dynamics .",
    "this coupling process will allow for very short periods of time , protons and electrons to reach very high temperatures ( @xmath186 ) before they collisionally lose their heat to the neutrals .",
    "it is possible that high frequency observations of chromospheric reconnection would reveal the presence of high energy thermal emission ( potentially in @xmath5-rays ) at the reconnection site .    in this paper , we have presented a mechanism for reaching kinetic scales through reconnection in a partially ionized plasma . the interesting problem that we have addressed here is important to the basic physics of magnetic reconnection in the solar chromosphere , and could potentially be applied in other partially ionized , astrophysical plasmas .",
    "however , there is still one question that we must address : is significant flux reconnected at small scales ? this is a point of great interest as if only a small amount of flux is being reconnected quickly , it is unlikely that the global reconnection rate would greatly differ . to discuss this",
    ", we use the results from two studies performed on the plasmoid instability in a fully ionized plasma .",
    "@xcite gives the distribution of the frequency of plasmoids with a given flux as @xmath187 and @xcite gives @xmath188 .",
    "for the former , this implies that the total flux reconnected at any scale should be the same as any other scale , the latter implies that the reconnected flux is dominated by small scales with a @xmath189 distribution .",
    "therefore , this leads us to believe that significant flux is reconnected at small scales , allowing the cascade to collisionless reconnection that our model describes to present a significant increase in the reconnection rate .",

    "<S> we propose that as the reconnecting current sheet thins and the tearing instability develops , plasmoid formation passes through strongly , intermediately , and weakly coupled ( or decoupled ) regimes , with the time scale for the tearing mode instability depending on the frictional coupling between ions and neutrals . </S>",
    "<S> we present calculations for the relevant time scales for fractal tearing in all three regimes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that as a result of the tearing mode instability and the subsequent non - linear instability due to the plasmoid - dominated reconnection , the sweet  parker current sheet tends to have a fractal - like structure , and when the chromospheric magnetic field is sufficiently strong the tearing instability can reach down to kinetic scales , which are hypothesized to be necessary for fast reconnection . </S>"
