    "secure communication is a topic that is becoming increasingly important thanks to the proliferation of wireless devices . over the years",
    ", several secrecy protocols have been developed and incorporated in several wireless standards ; e.g. , the ieee 802.11 specifications for wi - fi . however ,",
    "as new schemes are being developed , methods to counter the specific techniques also appear . breaking this cycle is critically dependent on the design of protocols that offer provable secrecy guarantees .",
    "the information theoretic secrecy paradigm adopted here , allows for a systematic approach for the design of low complexity and provable secrecy protocols that fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the wireless medium .",
    "most of the recent work on information theoretic secrecy is , arguably , inspired by wyner s wiretap channel  @xcite . in this setup",
    ", a passive eavesdropper listens to the communication between two legitimate nodes over a separate communication channel . while attempting to decipher the message , no limit is imposed on the computational resources available to the eavesdropper .",
    "this assumption led to defining * perfect secrecy capacity * as the maximum achievable rate subject to zero mutual information rate between the transmitted message and the signal received by the eavesdropper . in the additive gaussian noise scenario",
    "@xcite , the perfect secrecy capacity turned out to be the difference between the capacities of the legitimate and eavesdropper channels . therefore ,",
    "if the eavesdropper channel has a higher channel gain , information theoretic secure communication is not possible over the main channel .",
    "recent works have shown how to exploit multipath fading to avoid this limitation  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to opportunistically exploit the instants when the main channel enjoys a higher gain than the eavesdropper channel to exchange secure messages .",
    "this opportunistic secrecy approach was shown to achieve non - zero * ergodic secrecy capacity * even when * on average * the eavesdropper channel has favorable conditions over the legitimate channel .",
    "remarkably , this result still holds even when the channel state information of the eavesdropper channel is not available at the legitimate nodes .",
    "the ergodic result in  @xcite applies only to delay tolerant traffic , e.g. , file downloads .",
    "early attempts at characterizing the delay limited secrecy capacity drew the negative conclusion that non - zero delay limited secrecy rates are not achievable , over almost all channel distributions , due to * secrecy outage * events corresponding to the instants when the eavesdropper channel gain is larger than the main one  @xcite .",
    "later , it was shown in  @xcite that , interestingly , a non - zero delay limited secrecy rate could be achieved by introducing * private key queues * at both the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "these queues are used to store private key bits that are shared * opportunistically * between the legitimate nodes when the main channel is more favorable than the one seen by the eavesdropper .",
    "these key bits are used later to secure the delay sensitive data using the vernam one time pad approach @xcite .",
    "hence , secrecy outages are avoided by simply storing the secrecy generated previously , in the form of key bits , and using them whenever the channel conditions are more advantageous for the eavesdropper . however , this work stopped short of proving sharp capacity results or deriving the corresponding optimal power control policies .",
    "these results can be recovered as special cases of the secrecy outage capacity and power control characterization obtained in the sequel .",
    "in particular , this work investigates the outage secrecy capacity of point - to - point block fading channels .",
    "we first consider the scenario where perfect knowledge about the main and eavesdropper channels are available _ a - priori _ at the transmitter . the outage secrecy capacity and corresponding optimal power control policy is obtained and then the results are generalized to the more practical scenario where only the main channel state information ( csi ) is available at the transmitter .",
    "finally , the impact of the _ private key queue _ overflow on secrecy outage probability is studied .",
    "overall , our results reveals interesting structural insights on the optimal encoding and power control schemes as well as sharp characterizations of the fundamental limits on secure communication of delay sensitive traffic over fading channels .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows.we formally introduce our system model in section  [ s : sysmodel ] . in section  [ section : capacity",
    "] , we obtain the capacity results for the full and main csi scenarios .",
    "the optimal power control policies , for both cases , are derived in section  [ section : power ] .",
    "the effect of key buffer overflow on the outage probability is investigated in section  [ s : finitebuffer ] .",
    "we provide simulations to support our main results in section  [ section : simulations ] .",
    "finally , section  [ s : conclusion ] offers some concluding remarks . to enhance the flow of the paper , the proofs",
    "are collected in the appendices .",
    "we study a point - to - point wireless communication link , in which a transmitter is trying to send information to a legitimate receiver , under the presence of a passive eavesdropper .",

    "we use similar notation for other signals as well , and denote the sample realization sequences with lowercase letters .",
    "we assume that the probability density function of instantaneous channel gains , denoted as @xmath20 , is well defined , and is known by all parties .",
    "we define channel state information ( csi ) as one s knowledge of the instantaneous channel gains .",
    "we define _ full transmitter csi _ as the case in which the transmitter has full causal knowledge of the main and eavesdropper channel gains .",
    "we define _ main transmitter csi _ as the case in which that the transmitter only knows the csi of the legitimate receiver . in both cases , the eavesdropper has complete knowledge of both the main and the eavesdropper channels .",

    "@xmath25 becomes available at the transmitter at the beginning of block @xmath3 , and needs to be securely communicated to the legitimate receiver at the end of that particular block .",
    "we consider the problem of constructing @xmath26 codes to communicate message packets @xmath27 of equal size , which consists of :    1 .   a stochastic encoder that maps @xmath28 , @xmath29 to @xmath30 based on the available csi , where @xmath31 summarizes the previously transmitted signals , in which case the previous signals are summarized by @xmath32 .",

    "note that we consider the current block @xmath30 to be a function of the past blocks @xmath31 as well .",
    "this kind of generality allows us to store shared randomness to be exploited in the future to increase the achievable secrecy rate .",
    "define the error event with parameter @xmath35 at block @xmath3 as @xmath36 which occurs either when the decoder makes an error , or when the power expended is greater than @xmath37 .",
    "the equivocation rate at the eavesdropper is defined as the entropy rate of the message at block @xmath3 , conditioned on the received signal by the eavesdropper during the transmission period , and available eavesdropper csi , which is equal to @xmath38 .",

    "the notion of secrecy outage was previous defined and used in @xcite .",
    "however , those works did not consider the technique of storing shared randomness for future use , and in that case , secrecy outage depends only on the instantaneous channel states . in our case ,",
    "secrecy outage depends on previous channel states as well .",

    "we refer to the first superblock as an initialization phase used to generate initial common randomness between the legitimate nodes .",

    "in other words , when a session ( which consists of @xmath2 superblocks ) between the associated nodes is over , they would have sufficient number of common key bits for the subsequent session , and would not need to initiate the initialization step again .",
    "in this section , we investigate this capacity under two different cases ; full csi and main csi at the transmitter . before giving the capacity results ,",
