    "developing efficient algorithms to solve problems in statistical mechanics involving strongly correlated fermions is an important area of research in computational physics .",
    "such problems are often afflicted with sign problems and are difficult to handle using monte carlo techniques .",
    "the conventional approach is to integrate the fermions out and write the problem in terms of a statistical mechanics of a bosonic system where the fermionic physics is hidden in the boltzmann weight as a determinant of a matrix @xcite . in some interesting cases the determinant is positive definite which makes it possible to design monte carlo methods for solving the problem",
    "this approach is often referred to as the determinantal monte carlo method .",
    "unfortunately , the method fails in many cases since the fermion determinant can often be negative .",
    "even when the determinant is guaranteed to be positive the algorithms can be inefficient in certain interesting range of parameters .",
    "determinantal monte carlo methods can often be formulated only when the partition function is written as a path integral in discrete euclidean time , which leads to time - discretization errors .",
    "although such errors are controllable through extrapolation techniques they can be time consuming .",
    "all these difficulties make it important to explore alternative algorithms .",
    "recently , another approach to fermionic physics in which fermionic partition functions are written in the occupation number basis has gained popularity @xcite .",
    "although in this approach one encounters sign problems it is sometimes possible to design efficient algorithms in regions of parameter space where the sign problems are mild . in certain cases this approach also leads to novel solutions to the sign problems @xcite , which in turn lead to algorithms which are much more efficient than conventional ones .",
    "this has lead recently , for instance , to the first successful confirmation of the kosterlitz - thouless behavior in a fermionic model @xcite . in this article",
    ", we explore a new algorithm to study the physics of electrons in a partially filled band interacting with a few impurities .",
    "quantum impurity models are , of course , classics of condensed matter many - body physics @xcite .",
    "interest in them has been reawakened in recent years because of developments from two completely different points of view .",
    "on the one hand , quantum dots in semiconductor heterostructures allow for the creation of tunable quantum impurities which can be studied individually and with exquisite precision @xcite .",
    "our particular interest is in studying the effects of mesoscopic fluctuations on the many - body physics @xcite . on the other hand , the study of strongly correlated electron systems away from half filling  systems which continue to be investigated intensively  leads naturally to fermionic quantum impurity models through the dynamical mean theory approximation @xcite .",
    "we plan to use our method in this connection in the future .",
    "since the anderson single impurity model is the simplest in this class @xcite , we focus on it ; it is straight forward to extend the method to include more impurities .",
    "the hamiltonian of the anderson impurity model which we consider is @xmath0 where the first term represents the free band electron energy levels , the second term is the impurity energy , the third represents the hopping amplitudes between free electron states and the impurity , and the last term is the repulsive coulomb interaction term at the impurity site .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the bandwidth .",
    "this model was introduced over forty years ago by anderson @xcite to study the affects of impurity spins embedded in metals .",
    "today , this model plays a very important role in understanding a variety of condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "the problem can be solved analytically for the case of a constant hopping amplitude and a constant density of energy levels with an infinite bandwidth , using the bethe ansatz @xcite . in the limit of large @xmath3",
    "one can relate this model to the famous kondo model @xcite .",
    "after his discovery of renormalization , wilson used this model to illustrate the numerical renormalization group program @xcite , which is a powerful method to solve this problem .",
    "it is now well understood that the low temperature properties of this model require a non - perturbative approach .",
    "more than a decade ago hirsch and fye developed a determinantal monte - carlo algorithm to study this model @xcite .",
    "such an approach is necessary to solve the hamiltonian in eq.([aham ] ) with general parameters . in this method",
    "the partition function for a given temperature is rewritten as a statistical mechanics of a model on a discrete temporal lattice .",
    "an auxiliary ising variable for the impurity is introduced as a function of time in order to convert the hamiltonian into a problem in which fermions are free but interact with the ising spin .",
    "it is then possible to integrate the fermions completely to write the problem as a statistical mechanics of the ising spin .",
    "the boltzmann weight can be written in terms of certain green functions which can be computed easily .",
    "unfortunately , the algorithm slows down as the temporal lattice spacing is taken to zero for a fixed temperature .",
    "it is also difficult to approach the large @xmath3 limit since the discretization error becomes significant . finally , some observables are difficult to evaluate .",
    "one famous example is the impurity susceptibility which is known to contain large fluctuations @xcite .",
    "here we explore an alternate approach , by writing the partition function in the occupation number basis in continuous euclidean time .",
    "since fermionic occupations consist of two states one can use the recently developed directed - loop algorithm for quantum spin systems @xcite in continuous time @xcite . unlike the hirsch and fye algorithm , in our method one can only deal with a finite number of energy levels , but the discretization error in the euclidean time direction can be eliminated .",
    "this allows us to simulate a large value of @xmath3 with little effort . in the occupation number basis",
    "we can also easily calculate observables such as the average occupation numbers , and the local susceptibility .",
    "moreover , as we will discuss later we are able to calculate the impurity susceptibilities efficiently .",
    "inspite of these advantages , the boltzmann weights of our configurations can be negative due to the fermion permutation sign .",
    "thus , our method suffers from a sign problem .",
    "however , we find that the sign problem is rather mild down to the kondo temperature .",
    "interestingly , our approach also allows us to explore a new technique , called the multi - level algorithm , to solve the sign problem .",
    "this technique was recently used in lattice qcd in determining the string tension between quarks and anti - quarks @xcite .",
    "a similar technique was also explored in @xcite .",
    "since the multi - level technique is a general method , our method allows us to study the usefulness of this approach to solve a class of fermion sign problems .",
    "here we show that the multi - level technique is indeed useful in alleviating the sign problem .",
    "we were able to estimate signs of the order of @xmath4 using this approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the monte carlo algorithm for updating the anderson impurity model in the occupation number basis . in section iii",
    "we explain the multi - level algorithm and show how one can use it to calculate the average signs efficiently . in section",
    "iv we discuss how one can measure observables in our method .",
    "we discuss the calculation of the impurity susceptibility and how our method allows us to compute it efficiently .",
    "section v contains some results from the algorithm .",
    "section vi contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section we construct a monte carlo method to calculate quantities for the anderson impurity model described by the hamiltonian of eq.([aham ] ) .",
    "we begin by rewriting the partition function , @xmath5 at temperature @xmath6 , as a path integral in euclidean time .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing @xmath7 imaginary time slices and writing @xmath8 where @xmath9 represent the electron states on the @xmath10-th time slice in the occupation number basis . since we are evaluating the trace we must have @xmath11 .",
    "the true partition function in continuous time is obtained in the limit of large @xmath12 and small @xmath13 at fixed @xmath14 .",
    "we can define @xmath15 \\sigma[c ] \\equiv \\prod^{m-1}_{i=0 } < c_i|{\\rm e}^{-\\tau h}|c_{i+1 } > , \\label{boltz}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the magnitude and @xmath17 $ ] the sign of the boltzmann weight",
    ". then the partition function can be written as @xmath18\\sigma[c].\\ ] ] in the monte carlo method each space - time configuration @xmath19 is generated stochastically with probability @xmath20}{\\sum_{c } w[c]}. \\label{prob}\\ ] ] ignoring the sign , each configuration of fermion occupation numbers is analogous to that of a configuration of a quantum spin - half particles .",
    "hence we can use an extension of the directed loop algorithm discussed in @xcite to update the space - time occupation number configurations @xmath19 directly in continuous time . a simple way to construct such an update",
    "is to construct the update rules for finite @xmath12 and then take the limit of infinite @xmath12 .",
    "below we describe our rules .",
    "a special feature of the anderson model is that electron hopping must include the impurity and any of the band electron sites .",
    "however , since all the band electron sites are involved , in our algorithm a `` vertex '' , in the language of @xcite , is change in the configuration between two adjacent time slices , @xmath9 and @xmath21 . if @xmath22 then one has a diagonal configuration with weight @xmath23 up to first order in @xmath13 .",
    "since we will take the continuum time limit this is sufficient .",
    "if @xmath24 then the two configurations can only differ in the occupation numbers of either the spin up or the spin down impurity fermion and the corresponding spin of one of the band fermion levels with momentum say @xmath25 .",
    "further both spins can not hop simultaneously !",
    "thus , if these constraints are met then @xmath26 otherwise the matrix element is zero and is disallowed .",
    "our directed loop update begins by choosing a point , with @xmath27 probability on the impurity and @xmath27 probability on the other sites chosen randomly on one of the spin layers .",
    "then with probability half the path enters the vertex either in the positive time direction or the negative time direction . using a set of rules that governs the exit of the update path at each `` vertex '' given the entrance of the path",
    ", the loop grows until it finds the starting point , where the update ends .",
    "the occupation numbers are changed while the loop is being constructed .    since the hamiltonian commutes with the total spin operator and the total fermion number operator , the rules that generate the loop must satisfy the appropriate conservation laws . in addition , since we will ultimately take the @xmath28 limit , processes of order @xmath29 should not be considered .",
    "thus , only one hopping can occur at a vertex .",
    "using these constraints one can determine all the allowed processes in a given vertex .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex0 ] in which the directed loop enters the vertex through a filled electron state in the band with a definite spin . on the right , four",
    "occupation number conserving exit paths ( ( a),(b),(c),(d ) ) are shown .",
    "it is easy to see that , up to order @xmath13 , only ( a ) and ( b ) are allowed . once all the possible paths are determined , all the processes are given probability weights such that they satisfy detailed balance .",
    "for example in this case the bounce weight ( a ) can be chosen to be zero , so that the continuation process ( b ) occurs with probability one . for vertices where the path enters an occupied site ,",
    "all possible loop segment assignments are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertexall ] . the example considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex0 ] is shown as vertex e in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertexall ] .",
    "let us now discuss the other vertices .",
    "first , consider a vertex where a hopping occurs at site @xmath30 and the loop enters the vertex at site @xmath30 ( vertex a in fig .  [",
    "fig : vertexall ] ) .",
    "there are a total of @xmath31 different possible exits in this vertex where @xmath32 is the total number of band energy levels .",
    "let @xmath33 be the weight for the path to exit at another band electron level @xmath34 .",
    "we choose @xmath35}{n+1}.\\ ] ] the probability for this process will then be given by @xmath36 . since @xmath33 is symmetric in @xmath30 and @xmath34 detailed balance is satisfied",
    "the remaining probability must be the probability for the loop to exit at the impurity .",
    "since there are two possible paths , for simplicity the weight for each of these processes is chosen to be @xmath37 then , the probability for these process is @xmath38 .",
    "the factor @xmath31 guarantees that all of @xmath39 are positive numbers .",
    "our choice of weights is such that in the case where all @xmath40 are the same all possible processes are equally likely .",
    "note that the loop does not bounce back at this vertex , and there is a unique direction for the loop at each of the band levels .",
    "in the case of vertex b the incoming path is on the impurity .",
    "the outgoing path can be at one of the electron band levels with momentum @xmath30 which has the weight @xmath41 which will be chosen to be equal to @xmath42 to satisfy detailed balance . in this case",
    "there is a possibility for the loop to continue forward or to bounce back . in order to fix the weights of these processes",
    "one compares the weight of the original vertex with that of the vertex obtained if the loop continues to go forward .",
    "if the forward continuation produces a vertex of the smaller weight , the bounce weight is chosen to be the absolute value of difference of the two weights ; otherwise the bounce weight is zero .",
    "there are two cases to be considered : for the case in which the impurity site contains an electron with the opposite spin ( to the spin at which the path is being constructed ) , the bounce weight is @xmath43 , and in the other case @xmath44 .",
    "this prescription along with the normalization condition fixes the weight of the continuation process .    in vertices c ,",
    "d and g every weight for the exit path hopping to or out of the impurity is chosen as @xmath45 so that the forward and backward probabilities in g are equal .",
    "continuation and bounce weights in vertices c and d are determined in the same way as for vertex b ; the bounce weight turns out to be @xmath46 if forward continuation lowers the weights , otherwise zero . in g",
    ", there is no bounce back . in vertex f",
    "a hopping from site @xmath30 to site @xmath34 occurs with weight @xmath47}{2}$ ] .",
    "finally , as discussed earlier , in vertex e the path is always forced to continue .",
    "the above rules can easily be extended to the case in which the directed loop enters a vertex on an empty site . although the above rules satisfy detailed balance , they are in no way unique . we chose the above rules after testing a few other possibilities since they were similar in efficiency if not better than other ones .",
    "it has been suggested that if the bounce probability is large then the algorithm is likely to become inefficient , since the proposed change is being rejected . in our case a large bounce weight in electron sites far away from the fermi surface is natural since the electron sites there either remain occupied or empty most of the time . on the other hand ,",
    "a large @xmath48 or @xmath3 leads to a large bounce probability in the vertex b at the impurity .",
    "thus , a large @xmath48 or @xmath3 may cause inefficiencies in our algorithm .",
    "one can choose a different set of weights to reduce the bounce weights by taking into account @xmath49 at all values of @xmath30 , but determining the weights in this case becomes difficult .",
    "we have tested a few different set of weights which gives less bounce back at the impurity and band electrons .",
    "unfortunately , our attempts have not improved the efficiency of the algorithm further .",
    "so here we report on the results using simplest algorithm discussed above .    until now the limit of @xmath50 was not taken . as @xmath13",
    "is taken to the zero , one gets the continuous time version . from @xmath51 , @xmath41 , and the bounce weights , one can easily evaluate the decay rates for the continuous time simulation .",
    "the monte carlo simulation in continuous time proceeds as follows : first , we pick a starting time , spin , and path direction . for the starting site",
    ", the impurity site is picked more often .",
    "typically 50% of the starting points are at the impurity and the remaining @xmath27 on the levels in the band with equal probability @xcite .",
    "the path for the loop continues in time until a decay occurs into one of the possible vertices .",
    "then , the new level and the direction are determined by the exit process .",
    "if a path hits a time slice where the configuration changes before a decay occurs , then the vertex at that time slice is used to decide the exit process .",
    "the loop update continues until it closes .",
    "as the loop is constructed the occupation states along the loop are flipped .",
    "in a given configuration @xmath19 electrons hop between the band and the impurity site so that in a periodic configuration in imaginary time , the electrons permute their positions . due to the pauli principle",
    ", this causes configurations to have a positive or a negative sign .",
    "this is the reason for the factor @xmath17 $ ] in eq.([boltz ] ) .",
    "any physical quantity @xmath52 can be computed using @xmath53 w(c)}{\\sum_c\\ , \\sigma[c]\\ , w(c ) } = \\frac{\\langle o \\sigma\\rangle}{\\langle \\sigma\\rangle},\\ ] ] where the final expectation values are computed using the monte carlo algorithm discussed in the previous section that generates configurations with probability @xmath54 defined in eq.([prob ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , as the temperature decreases , both the numerator and the denominator decrease exponentially which makes the calculations of fermionic observables at low temperatures extremely difficult .",
    "thus one needs an efficient method to compute exponentially small numbers by averaging large positive and negative numbers , a problem that is generically referred to as the _ sign problem_.    recently , a clever trick referred to as the multi - level algorithm was discovered in the context of lattice qcd to compute exponentially small numbers @xcite .",
    "in particular it was possible to compute the potential @xmath55 between quarks and anti - quarks , by computing the corresponding exponentially small boltzmann weight @xmath56 at a temperature @xmath57 . in lattice qcd",
    "this quantity can be computed by averaging the wilson loop which is typically of order @xmath58 for a given configuration .",
    "it was shown that the multi - level algorithm could compute averages of wilson loops that were as small as @xmath59 .",
    "the basic idea was to write the observable , in this case the wilson loop , as a product of many terms such that each of the terms is not very small even though the product is very small . in this article",
    "we show that a similar approach can be applied to compute the average sign in the fermionic problem using the directed - loop algorithm .    in order to apply the multi - level algorithm",
    "let us divide the euclidean time @xmath14 of the lattice into @xmath60 parts with the same time thickness .",
    "let us denote the sub - lattice configuration of fermions inside each of these parts by @xmath61 and the boundaries between the sub - lattices by @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents the euclidean times at the boundaries .",
    "periodic boundary conditions in time means that @xmath64 .",
    "now , the boundary configurations @xmath65 and sub - lattice configurations @xmath66 determine the entire configuration @xmath19 .",
    "the probability @xmath54 can then be expressed as @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the probability of finding the configuration @xmath65 on the boundaries and @xmath69 is the conditional probability of finding the configuration @xmath70 given the boundary configurations @xmath65 .",
    "clearly , @xmath69 depends only on the boundaries that bound the @xmath10th sub - lattice . since the sign of a configuration",
    "@xmath17 $ ] can be written as a product of sign factors coming from each of the sub - lattices , the average sign can be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the sign that comes from the sub - lattice @xmath10 .",
    "now @xmath73 is just the average sign of the @xmath10-th sub - lattice with a fixed boundary configuration .",
    "so @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the average sign of the sub - lattice @xmath10 with the boundary @xmath65 .",
    "the multi - level algorithm proceeds as follows : first , to generate a sequence of boundaries @xmath65 , one updates the entire lattice . then , with a fixed boundary configuration @xmath65 , one generates a subsequence of @xmath76 configurations for each sub - lattice .",
    "the directed loop algorithm is well suited for this update ; when the directed - loop encounters the fixed time slice the path is forced to bounce back ! clearly one can estimate the average sign @xmath77 of each sub - lattice independently using the @xmath76 configurations and then use their product to compute @xmath78 .",
    "it should be emphasized that although the sub - lattice averages are not exact there is no systemic errors in this approach .",
    "@xmath76 is determined empirically so as to make the calculation efficient .",
    "the sub - averages do not have to be calculated more accurately than the size of the fluctuations due to change in the boundaries . once the sub - lattices are updated",
    "the entire configuration is again updated to generate a new set of boundary configurations @xmath65 . repeating this process ,",
    "a series of sign measurements are generated .",
    "the final result of the sign is obtained by averaging these measurements .",
    "the statistical noise in the sign is reduced because effectively one is summing over @xmath79 configurations for each of these measurements .    in the multi - level algorithm",
    "one can also build nested levels of update .",
    "in particular one can performs a @xmath80 level update if the euclidean time direction is divided into @xmath60 parts . during the update at the first level all time slices",
    "@xmath81 are held fixed , in the update as discussed above . at this level",
    "@xmath76 loop updates are performed between the fixed time - slices . at the second level only time slices at @xmath82 are held fixed .",
    "after every update at the second level , the full first level update is performed .",
    "this procedure is repeated @xmath76 times .",
    "this process is repeated at higher levels ; such that at each highest level update , all the complete lower level updates are performed .",
    "thus , at the @xmath80th level the whole lattice is updated with just the @xmath83 time - slice held fixed .",
    "one can extend the ideas of measuring the sign for a single level update as discussed above , to the @xmath80-level update . after summing over the signs of all the configurations generated during the @xmath80 level update one",
    "computes a value of the sign .",
    "if at each level one performs @xmath76 updates for each sub - lattice , one performs on the order of @xmath84 loop updates after the @xmath80th - level update . since @xmath85 , then for a fixed @xmath86 if the effort for a single loop update remains fixed , the effort to compute the sign for a full @xmath80-level update grows as a power of @xmath14 .",
    "as more levels are introduced , it takes longer for the measurement of sign . in fig .",
    "[ fig : multilevel ] we show a schematic description of the multi - level idea .",
    "one can apply the multi - level technique to other observables which can be written as product of quantities on each of the sub - lattices .",
    "we call such observables as being compatible with the multi - level algorithm . the optimum number of levels should be determined empirically",
    ". this number can depend on the observable to be calculated .",
    "we also found that the full multi - level algorithm is the most efficient for fermion sign problems due to the large oscillations .",
    "since the monte carlo update is performed in the occupation number basis , all diagonal observables @xmath87 $ ] that are functions of the occupation numbers can easily be calculated using the formula @xmath88",
    "\\sigma[c]\\rangle}{\\langle \\sigma[c ] \\rangle}.\\ ] ] average occupation number of a level is one of the observables which belongs to this class .",
    "another important diagonal observable in the anderson impurity model is the local susceptibility @xmath89 which can be obtained from configurations of the impurity as a function of imaginary time .",
    "this method of computation can only be reliable for regions of temperature where the sign problem is mild or when the multi - level algorithm discussed above is applicable and useful .",
    "both , the average occupation numbers and the local susceptibility , are compatible with the multi - level algorithm and hence the algorithm can be used to alleviate the sign problem in calculating these quantities .",
    "the quantity more directly relevant to experiment is the impurity susceptibility , @xmath90 , which is the total susceptibility minus the free susceptibility : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the susceptibility from the @xmath10-th free electron site . in the determinantal monte carlo ( the hirsch and fye algorithm )",
    "the impurity susceptibility is very difficult to calculate due to statistical noises in the simulation @xcite .",
    "the problem is that one has to calculate the total susceptibility for the anderson hamiltonian and then subtract the susceptibility for the free case from it .",
    "the total susceptibility is a quantity of order @xmath32 ( the number of band electron sites ) , but the impurity susceptibility is of order 1 .",
    "so one has to calculate the total susceptibility with the error of order 1 or less , which is extremely difficult for large lattice @xmath32 . from the clogston - anderson compensation theorem @xcite , for a large bandwidth with a flat energy density and equal hopping amplitudes",
    ", one can expect that the local susceptibility is equal to the impurity susceptibility .",
    "but in the study of mesoscopic fluctuations the two susceptibilities can be quite different @xcite .",
    "one of the main advantages of our method is that with our algorithm the impurity susceptibility can be measured with significantly reduced statistical noise .",
    "let us now discuss how we can compute @xmath90 .    for configurations in the occupation number basis generated during the update ,",
    "the hopping of electrons occurs at only a small number of electron sites .",
    "the rest of the energy sites appear to be free ; an advantage of working in the `` momentum '' space lattice .",
    "suppose that @xmath93 sites are involved in the hopping for a given configuration @xmath19 .",
    "denote the configuration of those sites by @xmath94 , and the free part by @xmath95 .",
    "then , one can express the probability of @xmath19 as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the probability of @xmath95 with a given @xmath94 .",

    "the size of statistical fluctuation of the measurements of the impurity susceptibility is of order of the number of electron sites in which the hopping occurs for a configuration .",
    "so the statistical noise in this method are substantially reduced .",
    "the observables that go into eq.([impsus ] ) are again compatible with the multi - level algorithm .    unfortunately , we have found that the above technique is still noisy in practice .",
    "interestingly , one can reduce the statistical noise in @xmath104 further by using the technique of improved estimator that is commonly used in cluster algorithms . in this method",
    "one identifies all spin clusters for a given configuration @xmath94 that can be flipped independently and performs a partial average over these cluster flips . unfortunately",
    ", this step is not compatible with the multi - level algorithm .",
    "but for the case where the sign problem is moderate the impurity susceptibility can be computed very efficiently using our algorithm .",
    "in this section we discuss results from the simulation of the anderson hamiltonian given in eq.([aham ] ) with the algorithm described in the previous sections .",
    "first , let us focus on the calculation of the average sign using the multi - level algorithm .",

    "[ fig : ave_sign ] we plot the average sign as a function of @xmath14 and we see that all the values fall nicely on an exponential form as expected .    now",
    "the biggest question to answer is whether the multi - level algorithm is useful .",
    "we would first like to point out that it is still difficult to compute the average sign with reasonable errors at very small temperatures .",
    "the required effort grows as at least a large power of @xmath14 , and we can not rule out an exponential growth at the moment . however , the fact that for @xmath113 we could compute numbers of the order of @xmath4 itself is an indication that some progress has been achieved . without the multi - level algorithm",
    "this would have been impossible .",
    "if we look at the individual values of the sign computed by the multi - level algorithm after each update we learn something further .",
    "[ fig : signs ] shows these values of the signs for different values of @xmath14 .",
    "we see that using the multi - level algorithm the values of the signs are dominated by positive values . for example one",
    "can see that at @xmath113 the average sign has most contributions from the positive side .",
    "we show this in fig .",
    "[ fig : signs_pos_neg ] by focusing on the first 2000 positive and negative values .",
    "we see that although the very small values come with equal weight between positive and negative values , there are a few positive numbers that dominate over the negative numbers .",
    "the multi - level algorithm has allowed us to find configurations whose signs , when summed up , leads to a very small number which can either be positive or negative but occasionally it also leads to numbers which are orders of magnitude larger but mostly positive .",
    "the large error in the average sign is mainly due to these large fluctuations but always in the positive direction . in the next section",
    "we will discuss why this observation is interesting .    in order to show that the new algorithm is indeed interesting , for the parameters chosen above we compute the average occupation numbers for the various energy levels . in fig .",
    "[ fig : occup ] we plot the differences between the average occupation numbers in the interacting cases and the free cases at the temperatures @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the open circles give the results in the cases where @xmath126 in which case one can obtain the result also from the exact green functions assuming the density of energy levels is smooth ( solid line ) .",
    "thus , we see that our algorithm can indeed produce results in good agreement . for the case of @xmath109 , the kondo temperature for this system",
    "is roughly @xmath127 as seen from the numerical renormalization method @xcite . in this case @xmath124 and @xmath125 correspond to a temperature of about @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we see that indeed the kondo resonance appears as expected .    0.4 in    finally , we focus on the local and impurity susceptibilities . to check the clogston - anderson compensation theorem ,",
    "a larger bandwidth @xmath130 is chosen with @xmath131 . for @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath90",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] . for the local susceptibility , with the multi - level method",
    "we were able to calculate the local susceptibility at a much lower temperature than the impurity susceptibility .",
    "we find that @xmath133 and @xmath90 are in reasonable agreement as expected from the clogston - anderson compensation theorem .",
    "we also compare our result with the nrg curve ( solid line ) obtained for @xmath134 which passes through most of the data points .",
    "since our simulations are in continuous euclidean time , we can simulate a large @xmath3 without increasing the discretization error . in the limit of large @xmath3",
    ", the anderson model converges to the kondo model . in the kondo model , band electrons and impurity spin",
    "interact with the coupling @xmath135 . from the schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite , the effective coupling @xmath135 of the anderson hamiltonian for a large @xmath3 is @xmath136 . in order to go towards the kondo limit we fix @xmath137 and study the case where @xmath138 .",
    "the local and impurity susceptibilities are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] .",
    "we see that now these two are completely different .",
    "we attribute this difference to the fact that @xmath139 in which case the compensation theorem is no longer valid .",
    "we have also computed the various observables discussed in this article for the hamiltonian that contains mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "we find that typically we can use our new method to compute quantities for temperatures as low as @xmath140 .",
    "using the multi - level technique we can also go down to temperatures of about @xmath141 .",
    "in this article we have investigated a new algorithm for a model involving a band of fermions interacting with a single impurity in the occupation number basis in `` momentum '' space .",
    "we use the efficient directed loop algorithm to update the configurations and absorb the sign into observables .",
    "we find that the sign problem is mild down to temperatures of order @xmath129 .",
    "further , the new approach allows us to explore a new multi - level algorithm to compute average signs efficiently .",
    "we were able to compute signs of the order of @xmath4 with moderate effort .",
    "the new approach also allows us to calculate certain quantities like the impurity susceptibility more efficiently than conventional monte carlo methods .",
    "finally , our algorithm can easily be extended to several impurities .",
    "the average of the sign over configurations that are generated in the multi - level algorithm fluctuates between small values which can be both positive and negative and large values which are orders of magnitude larger but always positive .",
    "the effort for this grows as @xmath116 where @xmath142 .",
    "although this does not solve the sign problem completely , since the positive numbers can still fluctuate a lot , perhaps half of the sign problem has been solved .",
    "if this is true then we think this is an exciting step in the solution to the full sign problem based on the recent progress in solving certain sign problems using the meron cluster algorithm @xcite .",
    "there it was possible to rewrite the partition function in terms of configurations where the boltzmann weight was either zero or positive .",
    "thus all negative signs were eliminated .",
    "the second step was algorithmic when all zero configurations were eliminated in an accept reject step .",
    "an intriguing question is whether something similar can be achieved in the present case .",
    "we leave this question for future research .",
