    "mesoscopic physics has traditionally involved the study of novel phenomena in phase - coherent , disordered conductors @xcite . in the diffusive regime , where the elastic mean free path @xmath0 is much smaller than the system size @xmath2 , the electron motion resembles that of a random walk between impurities .",
    "the more recent development of high - mobility semiconductor heterostructures together with advanced lithographic techniques has led to the confinement of electrons in two - dimensional microstructures of controllable , non - random geometry .",

    "such technological achievements have motivated theoretical approaches where the actual microcavities are approximated by `` clean '' quantum billiards ignoring impurity scattering completely . in these models",
    "the electron motion is only affected by bounces at the confinement potential , which is the opposite case to the diffusive regime where confinement effects are not important on timescales shorter than the thouless time .",

    ".    in defining spectral correlation functions in the `` ballistic '' regime one has to distinguish between disorder averaging , which we denote by @xmath4 , and size averaging , @xmath5 , which we assume to be equivalent to energy averaging .",
    "pure disorder averaging corresponds to the experimental situation of an ensemble of weakly disordered microstructures of the same size .",
    "recent work has shown that for this case spectral correlation functions contain , and often are dominated by , strong oscillatory structures in energy ( on scales @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the fermi wavenumber ) reflecting the presence of the confinement@xcite . they can be semiclassically interpreted as density - of - states oscillations related to classical periodic orbits of the corresponding clean system .    in the present work we consider spectral correlations after",

    "boundary effects are incorporated in a semiclassical representation of the green functions , which enter into the impurity diagrams , in terms of classical paths .",
    "this method , therefore , takes into account , in a systematic way , contributions from ( closed ) trajectories which involve both scattering at impurities and specular reflection at the confinement potential .",
