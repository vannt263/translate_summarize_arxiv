    "among the most important sources of gravitational waves ( gws ) in the low - frequency band of space - based detectors are the coalescences of massive black hole binaries ( mbhbs ) .",
    "binaries containing black holes with masses in the range @xmath6 are predicted to form through the hierarchical growth of structure as dark matter halos ( and the galaxies they host ) repeatedly merge ; see , for example , @xcite and @xcite for recent discussion . the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ )",
    "is being designed to have a sensitivity that would allow detailed measurement of the waves from these binaries .",
    "`` intrinsic '' parameters  the masses and spins of the black holes which compose the binary  should be determined with very high accuracy , with relative errors typically @xmath7 to @xmath8 , depending on system mass and redshift ; see lang & hughes ( 2006 , hereafter paper i ) for recent discussion . by measuring an ensemble of coalescences over a range of redshifts ,",
    "mbhb gws may serve as a kind of structure tracer , tracking the growth and spin evolution of black holes over cosmic time .",
    "`` extrinsic '' system parameters , describing a binary s location and orientation relative to the detector , are also determined by measuring its gws . in paper",
    "i , we showed that a binary s position on the sky can be localized at @xmath4 to an ellipse with a major axis of a few tens of arcminutes and a minor axis a factor of @xmath9 smaller . at",
    "higher redshift ( @xmath10 ) , these values degrade by a factor of a few , reaching a few degrees in the long direction and tens of arcminutes to a degree or two in the short one .",
    "we also found that , neglecting errors due to weak gravitational lensing , a source s luminosity distance typically can be determined to better @xmath11 at low redshift ( @xmath4 ) , degrading to several percent at higher redshift ( @xmath10 ) .    the intrinsic ability of gws to determine the distance to a coalescing binary is phenomenal .",
    "coalescing mbhb systems constitute exquisitely well calibrated distance measures , with the calibration provided by general relativity .",
    "unfortunately , this percent - level or better accuracy could only be achieved if we measured mbhb coalescences in an empty universe . in our universe ,",
    "weak lensing will magnify or demagnify the gws , and we will infer a luminosity distance smaller ( for magnification ) or larger ( for demagnification ) than the true value .",
    "this phenomenon affects all high - redshift standard candles .",
    "its impact on type ia supernovae in particular has been discussed in detail @xcite .",
    "it will not be possible to correct for this effect @xcite since much of the lensing `` noise '' arises from structure on subarcminute scales that is not probed by shear maps ( which map the distribution of matter on scales greater than @xmath12 or so ) .",
    "since we will not know the extent of the magnification when we measure mbhb waves , we must simply accept the fact that lensing introduces a dispersion of several percent in determining the distance to these gw events ( see , e.g. , wang et al .",
    "[ 2002 ] to compute this dispersion as a function of redshift ) .",
    "when we quote distance measurement errors , we will typically quote only the intrinsic gw measurement error , neglecting lensing s impact .",
    "when the intrinsic gw distance error is @xmath13 , lensing will blur it to the several percent level .",
    "note that a source s redshift @xmath14 _ can not _ be directly determined using only gws .",
    "gravitational wave measurements infer system parameters through their impact on certain dynamical timescales , such as orbital frequencies and the rate at which these frequencies evolve .",
    "since these time scales all suffer cosmological redshift , @xmath14 is degenerate with other parameters .",
    "for example , any mass parameter @xmath15 is actually measured as @xmath16 . however ,",
    "if the binary s luminosity distance is determined , its redshift can then be inferred by assuming a cosmography . for most binaries",
    ", the redshift can be determined to several percent ( with an error budget dominated by gravitational lensing , the error is actually dominated by peculiar velocity effects @xcite ; however , the event rate is probably negligible at such low redshifts . as such",
    ", we will focus on gravitational lensing as the main source of systematic redshift error . ] ) .",
    "we thus expect that gw measurements will locate a binary to within a three - dimensional `` gw pixel '' which at @xmath4 has a cross - sectional area of @xmath17 to @xmath18 and a depth @xmath19 several percent .",
    "it is anticipated that there will be great interest in searching the gw pixel for electromagnetic ( e.g. , optical , x - ray , radio ) counterparts to mbhb gw events .",
    "finding such a counterpart would be much easier if galactic activity were catalyzed in association with the coalescence @xcite .",
    "the nature of that activity is likely to depend rather strongly on the mass of the coalescing system @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite predict strong outflows and galactic activity prior to the final black hole merger as the smaller member of the binary drives gas onto the larger member , consistent with the high - mass ( @xmath20 ) predictions of @xcite . @xcite",
    "describe an x - ray afterglow that would ignite after gas refills the volume that is swept clean by the coalescing binary ; dotti et al .",
    "predict this outcome for smaller systems ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "recent work by @xcite suggests that the final burst of radiation from a coalescing binary ( which can convert @xmath22 of the system s mass to gws very suddenly ) may excite radial waves , and consequently electromagnetic variability , in an accretion disk due to the quick change in the disk s keplerian potential . such a signature may be essentially mass independent",
    ". on the other hand , the coalescence may be electromagnetically quiet , in which case we face the potentially daunting task of searching the three - dimensional pixel for galaxies with morphology consistent with a ( relatively ) recent merger , or that have a central velocity dispersion @xmath23 consistent with the inferred final black hole mass ( assuming that the @xmath24 relation [ ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ] holds at the redshift of these sources , and so soon after merger ) .",
    "if the host galaxy or some other counterpart can be identified , we could then contemplate combining gw information with electromagnetic data .",
    "for instance , combining _",
    "mass measurements with the luminosity of the counterpart may allow us to directly measure the eddington ratio @xmath25 @xcite . identifying a counterpart would also allow us to more accurately characterize the system .",
    "for example , much of the intrinsic luminosity distance error is due to correlations between distance and sky position .",
    "finding an electromagnetic counterpart essentially determines a binary s position precisely , breaking those correlations .",
    "previous studies have found that intrinsic distance error can be reduced by almost an order of magnitude if the position is known @xcite .",
    "( lensing errors still dominate in such a case , so that the distance remains determined only at the few percent level . ) a counterpart may also make it possible to simultaneously determine a source s luminosity distance and redshift .",
    "such a `` standard siren '' ( the gw analog of a standard candle ) would very usefully complement other high - redshift standard candles @xcite , such as type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "a direct measurement of redshift will also break the mass - redshift degeneracy more accurately than can be done with just the luminosity distance and some assumed cosmological parameters . breaking",
    "this degeneracy is critical when studying the growth of black holes with cosmic time @xcite .",
    "many analyses @xcite have quantified how well _ lisa _ can determine mbhb parameters , including sky position and distance , using maximum likelihood fisher matrix estimation .",
    "our results from paper i , given earlier , include the effects of `` spin - induced precession ''  precession of both the orbital plane and the individual spins of the black holes due to post - newtonian spin - interaction effects .",
    "a significant result from that analysis is that spin - induced precession improves sky position accuracy by about half an order of magnitude in each direction versus previous analyses .",
    "this result can be partially understood as due to the breaking of a degeneracy between position and orientation angles : thanks to precession , the binary s orientation evolves with time and can be untangled from sky position .",
    "this effect was already known due to pioneering work by @xcite ; by taking the analysis to higher order and considering a broader range of sources , we were able to show that this improvement held for essentially all astrophysically interesting mbhb sources .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine the localization of mbhb systems more thoroughly , in particular how the gw pixel evolves as the final merger is approached .",
    "paper i only presented results for measurements that proceed all the way to merger .",
    "it will clearly be of some interest to monitor potential hosts for the binary event some time before the merger happens ; if nothing else , telescopes will need prior warning to schedule observing campaigns .",
    "understanding the rate at which localization evolves can also have an important impact on the design of the _ lisa _ mission , clarifying how often it will be necessary to downlink data about mbhb systems in order to effectively guide surveys .    our main goal is to understand for what range of masses and redshifts prior localization of a binary using gws will be possible . a previous analysis by kocsis et al .",
    "( 2007b ; hereafter k07 ) also examined this problem in great detail , but without including the impact of spin - induced precession .",
    "one of our goals is to see to what extent precession physics changes the conclusions of k07 .",
    "we find that precession has a fairly small impact on the time evolution of the gw pixel except in the last few days before the final merger , at which point its impact can be tremendous .",
    "precession typically changes the area of the sky position error ellipse by a factor of @xmath26 ( up to @xmath27 in extreme cases ) in just the final day .",
    "this is in accord with the predictions of k07 ( and even earlier predictions by n. cornish 2005 , unpublished ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "first , in  , we briefly review the basics of the mbhb gravitational waveform and the parameter estimation formalism that we use ; this section is essentially a synopsis of relevant material from paper i. section [ sec : intrinsicgw ] reviews the form of the gws that we use in our analysis , while   [ sec : extrinsicgw ] describes how those waves are measured by the _",
    "lisa _ constellation .",
    "we describe the measurement formalism we use in   [ sec : formalism ] . in   [ sec : review ] , we summarize our results from paper i regarding the final localization accuracy that _ lisa _ can expect to achieve .",
    "we turn to a detailed discussion of the time evolution of the gw pixel in   [",
    "sec : results ] .",
    "we begin by summarizing the key ideas behind the `` harmonic mode decomposition '' of k07 in  .",
    "this technique cleverly allows calculation of the gw pixel and its time evolution with much less computational effort than our method ( albeit without including the impact of spin precession ) .",
    "unfortunately , we have discovered that some of the approximations used by k07 introduce a systematic underestimate of the final sky position error by a factor of @xmath0 or more in angle ; the approximations are much more reliable a week or more prior to the black holes final merger .",
    "modulo this underestimate , the k07 results agree well with a version of our code which does not include spin precession ( particularly a week or more in advance of merger , when their underestimate is not severe ) .",
    "k07 thus serves as a useful point of comparison to establish the impact of precession on source localization .",
    "section [ sec : timeevolve ] is dedicated to our results , including comparison to k07 when appropriate .",
    "we find that all relevant parameter errors decrease slowly with time until the last day before merger , when they drop more dramatically .",
    "this sudden drop is not found in k07 , nor is it present in a variant of our analysis that ignores spin precession .",
    "it clearly can be attributed to the impact of precession on the waveform . before this last day ,",
    "the major axis is @xmath1 times , the minor axis @xmath2 times , and the intrinsic error in the luminosity distance @xmath28 @xmath3 times bigger than at merger for most binaries ( i.e. , all except the highest masses ) .",
    "going back to one week ( one month ) before merger , these numbers change to @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) for the major axis , @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) for the minor axis , and @xmath31 ( @xmath33 ) for the error in the luminosity distance . as a result , for @xmath4",
    ", most binaries can be located within a few square degrees a week before merger and @xmath34 a month before merger .",
    "the intrinsic distance errors are also small enough this early that @xmath35 remains dominated by gravitational lensing errors of several percent .",
    "advanced localization of mbhb coalescences thus seems plausible for these binaries ; the situation is less promising for sources at higher redshift .    as a corollary to our study of the time evolution",
    ", we also examine the sky position dependence of errors (   [ sec : angdependence ] ) .",
    "the errors depend strongly on the polar angle with respect to the ecliptic , increasing in the ecliptic plane to as much as @xmath36 over the median for the major axis , @xmath37 over the median for the minor axis , and @xmath38 over the median for errors in the luminosity distance .",
    "the errors have a much weaker dependence on the azimuthal angle .",
    "when we convert to galactic coordinates , we find that the best localization regions appear to lie fairly far out of the galactic plane , offering hope that searches for counterparts will not be too badly impacted by foreground contamination .",
    "we conclude this paper in   [ sec : disc ] . besides summarizing our results",
    ", we discuss shortcomings of this analysis and future work which could help to better understand how well gws can localize mbhb sources .    throughout the paper we set @xmath39 ; a convenient conversion factor in this system is @xmath40 s. when discussing results , we always quote masses as they would be measured in the rest frame of the source .",
    "these masses must be multiplied by a factor of @xmath41 when used in any of the equations describing the system s dynamics or its gws ( particularly the equations of  ) .",
    "we convert between distance and redshift using a spatially flat cosmology with @xmath42 ( and hence @xmath43 ) and hubble constant @xmath44 .",
    "in this section , we present necessary background .",
    "we begin by summarizing the inspiral gw signal and its measurement by _",
    "lisa_. we then describe the parameter estimation formalism that we use in our code . more details on these topics can be found in paper i and references therein .",
    "finally , we present a synopsis of the results from paper i , summarizing the _ final _ sky position and distance accuracy that _ lisa _ can expect to achieve .",
    "detailed discussion of how this accuracy evolves as a function of time is deferred to  .",
    "as is by now traditional , we break the gws generated by a coalescing binary black hole system into three more or less distinct epochs : ( 1 ) a slowly evolving _ inspiral _ , in which the black holes gradually spiral toward each other as the orbit decays due to gw emission ; ( 2 ) a loud _ merger _ , in which the black holes come together and form a single body ; and ( 3 ) a _ ringdown _ , in which the merged remnant of the binary settles down to its final state .",
    "our analysis focuses on the inspiral , the most long - lived epoch of coalescence and the epoch in which spin precession plays a major dynamical role .",
    "the inspiral s duration means that _ lisa _ s position and orientation changes considerably during the measurement ; this , plus the impact of precession , is largely responsible for pinning down the sky position of coalescing sources .    the inspiral gw signal is modeled using the post - newtonian ( pn ) formalism @xcite",
    ". more specifically , we use the `` restricted '' pn approximation .",
    "the waveform can be written schematically as @xcite @xmath45 \\ , , \\label{eq : restrictedpn}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 labels pn order , @xmath15 is a harmonic index , and @xmath47 is the orbital phase . in the restricted pn case , we discard all amplitudes except the strongest newtonian quadrupole , @xmath48 . the phase , however , is computed to a desired pn order ( here the second one , or 2pn ) .",
    "it has been recognized for some time that important additional information is carried by subleading harmonics ( e.g. , hellings & moore 2003 ) .",
    "recent work @xcite has confirmed that sky position and distance are more sharply constrained when these terms are included in the wave model ( although there still appears to be some disagreement among different groups as to the extent of the improvement ) .",
    "we plan to include these terms in future work , examining how higher harmonics and precession combine to localize mbhb systems .",
    "spin - induced precession arises from geodetic and gravitomagnetic influences on the angular momentum vectors present in the binary .",
    "averaged over an orbit , the leading - order spin precession equations are @xcite @xmath49 \\times \\mathbf{s}_1 + \\frac{1}{r^3}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{s}_2-\\frac{3}{2}(\\mathbf{s}_2\\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{l}})\\mathbf{\\hat{l}}\\right ] \\times \\mathbf{s}_1 \\ , , \\label{eq : s1dot}\\\\ \\mathbf{\\dot{s}}_2 & = & \\frac{1}{r^3}\\left[\\left(2+\\frac{3}{2}\\frac{m_1}{m_2}\\right)\\mu \\sqrt{mr } \\mathbf{\\hat{l}}\\right ] \\times \\mathbf{s}_2 + \\frac{1}{r^3}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{s}_1-\\frac{3}{2}(\\mathbf{s}_1\\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{l}})\\mathbf{\\hat{l}}\\right ] \\times \\mathbf{s}_2 \\ , , \\label{eq : s2dot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the masses of holes 1 and 2 , @xmath52 is the total mass , @xmath53 is the reduced mass , @xmath54 is the normal to the orbital plane , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the spins of the holes , and @xmath57 is their orbital separation in harmonic coordinates . since total angular momentum is conserved on short timescales ( ignoring the inspiral ) , the orbital angular momentum precesses to compensate .",
    "these precessions drive several modifications to the orbital phase .",
    "one correction is due to spin - orbit and spin - spin terms in the post - newtonian expression for orbital frequency : precession makes these terms time dependent , adding a new modulation to the gw phase .",
    "another correction arises from the changing orientation of the orbital plane @xcite .",
    "the waveform is described as two polarizations propagating in the @xmath58 direction , where @xmath59 gives the direction to the binary on the sky : @xmath60 \\cos[\\phi(t ) + \\delta_p \\phi(t ) ] \\ , , \\label{eq : hplus}\\\\ h_{\\times}(t ) & = & -\\frac{4{\\mathcal m}^{5/3}(\\pi f)^{2/3}}{d_l}(\\mathbf{\\hat{l}}\\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{n } } ) \\sin[\\phi(t ) + \\delta_p \\phi(t ) ] \\ , , \\label{eq : hcross}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the frequency of the waves , @xmath28 is the luminosity distance , @xmath62 is the wave phase ( twice the orbital phase in the quadrupole approximation ) , and @xmath63 is the precessional correction to the orbital phase due to the changing orientation of the orbital plane .",
    "the `` chirp mass '' @xmath64 , which controls the frequency evolution , or chirp , of the signal , is given by @xmath65 .",
    "note that the relative weight of the polarizations is determined by the binary s inclination to the line of sight @xmath66 , where @xmath67 .",
    "the baseline _ lisa _ mission consists of three spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle with arms of length @xmath68 km .",
    "the center of this constellation orbits the sun @xmath69 behind the earth , with the triangle oriented at @xmath70 to the ecliptic .",
    "the individual spacecraft thus orbit in different planes , causing the triangle to `` roll '' about itself in its orbit . to model _ lisa _",
    "s response to a signal , we use the long wavelength ( @xmath71 ) approximation introduced by @xcite .",
    "the three arms of the triangle act as a pair of two - arm detectors ; the signals from the three arms are combined in such a way that the noise spectrum in each `` synthesized '' detector is independent of the other .",
    "each detector measures both gw polarizations , weighted by antenna response functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 labels the synthesized detector .",
    "these functions depend on the source s sky position as measured in the _ detector _ frame . because of the constellation s rolling orbital motion , these functions are time dependent .",
    "the motion around the sun also causes a doppler shift in the signal s frequency .",
    "this time dependence allows the sky position of the source to be measured .",
    "an additional time dependence is produced by the precession of the binary s orbital plane .",
    "we saw above that the polarizations strongly depend on the binary s inclination to the line of sight @xmath66 ( via @xmath75 ) .",
    "the antenna pattern functions @xmath76 also depend on the component of @xmath54 that is perpendicular to the line of sight .",
    "since precession changes the direction of the orbital plane , the measured polarizations would vary in time even if the detector were static .",
    "the timescale of these precessions is much shorter than the _",
    "orbital timescale of 1 yr , so they provide a great deal of additional information about sky position .",
    "we perform the parameter estimation analysis in the frequency domain , so we fourier transform the signal using the stationary phase approximation .",
    "the final measured waveform is given by @xmath77 f^{-7/6 } e^{i(\\psi(f ) - \\varphi_{\\mathrm{pol},i}[t(f ) ] - \\varphi_d[t(f ) ] - \\delta_p\\phi[t(f ) ] ) } \\ , , \\label{eq : freqdomainsignal}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the `` polarization amplitude , '' @xmath79 is the `` polarization phase , '' and @xmath80 is the doppler phase .",
    "the first two encode modulations due to the relative polarization weightings and antenna pattern functions ; the latter is due to the doppler shift in the gw frequency .",

    "see paper i for precise definitions . for our purposes ,",
    "the most important property of @xmath86 and @xmath23 is that they oscillate due to precession , modulating the phase @xmath81 .",
    "note that waveform ( [ eq : freqdomainsignal ] ) depends on 15 parameters : 2 masses , 6 initial spin components , 1 distance , 2 sky angles , 2 initial orbital plane angles , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the end of inspiral / beginning of merger is a somewhat ad hoc and fuzzy boundary .",
    "indeed , recent numerical computations have shown that the gws produced by a binary that coalesces into a single body do not show any particular special feature as the black holes come together , instead smoothly chirping through this transition @xcite .",
    "since we are not including numerical merger waves in our analysis , we require some point to terminate our post - newtonian expansion .",
    "most studies show that the inspiral comes to an end when the separation of the bodies in harmonic coordinates is roughly @xmath87 ; at this point , the system s gw frequency is approximately given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the keplerian orbital angular frequency .",

    "nearly identical results were found by k07 : figure 2 of k07 plots the evolution of sky position for an intermediate - mass binary from @xmath397 .",
    "they find that the measurement accuracy rapidly evolves early in the measurement , with slopes of angular error versus time very similar to what we show in figure [ fig : ellipsemedians ] for high - mass binaries .",
    "although these curves are qualitatively quite similar , there are significant quantitative differences .",
    "for example , the evolution of the intermediate - mass binaries is less than that of the low - mass binaries , especially in the last day .",
    "the intermediate - mass major axes shrink by a factor of @xmath398 over the entire four - week period , whereas the low - mass axes shrink by a factor of @xmath399 .",
    "another important quantitative difference can be seen by comparing the major and minor axes .",
    "we find that the ratio @xmath400 grows with time in most cases , indicating that the minor axis tends to shrink more rapidly than the major axis .",
    "the only exceptions are the previously described high - mass cases , in which @xmath400 shrinks during most or all of the inspiral . presumably the same behavior would also be seen for lower mass binaries at higher values of @xmath377 ; this conclusion is supported by figure 4 of @xcite . for all other cases , @xmath400 @xmath401 at @xmath395 and",
    "increases to @xmath402 at @xmath403 .",
    "the largest increase is typically in the final day .    what causes this dramatic improvement in the last day of inspiral ?",
    "three factors primarily contribute to our ability to localize a source on the sky : modulations due to _ lisa _ s orbital motion , modulations due to spin precession , and s / n accumulated over time . since _",
    "lisa _ moves the same amount in the final day as in any other day , orbital - induced modulations can not be the cause .",
    "a great deal of s / n is accumulated in the last day ( typically increasing by a factor of @xmath195 or more ) , and many parameter errors scale as ( s / n)@xmath404 .",
    "however , k07 demonstrate that sky position and distance errors do not scale as ( s / n)@xmath404 in the last few weeks before merger .",
    "our `` no precession '' code supports their conclusion : the final jump in s / n can not make up for the lack of orbital modulation over such a short timescale .",
    "the remaining possibility is spin - induced precession .",
    "indeed , we found in paper i that the number of modulations due to spin precession increases dramatically as the binary approaches merger .",
    "this suggests that the improvement we see is due to the impact of precession .",
    "to examine this hypothesis , we plot the `` precession '' and `` no precession '' results together on the same axes .",
    "figure [ fig : npcomparison ] shows such a plot for a low - mass system and an intermediate - mass system at @xmath4 .",
    "we see that at @xmath395 days , the two codes give similar results for localization accuracy .",
    "their predictions gradually diverge as merger is approached .",
    "the greatest jump between the two codes occurs on the last day before merger , agreeing with our expectation that precession effects are maximal then .",
    "the effect is greater in the low - mass case than in the intermediate - mass case .",
    "similarly , the ratio @xmath400 starts about the same in both codes , growing very slowly until @xmath387 . at this point , it jumps dramatically in the precession code , while staying roughly the same in the no precession code .",
    "interestingly , one effect of precession is that the localization errors track ( s / n)@xmath404 rather closely . by breaking the various correlations which made them",
    "deviate from ( s / n)@xmath404 , precession - induced modulations allow the errors to evolve in a manner that is more consistent with our naive expectations .     and @xmath135 as a function of time , comparing an analysis that accounts for spin - induced precession to one that neglects it .",

    "the reduction of these correlations coincides with the sudden drop in parameter errors seen in figure [ fig : pixels ] ( and , by extension to the entire monte carlo run , figs .",

    "minimized_. )    by binning the data sets developed for paper i , we were able to confirm this behavior over a wide range of masses and redshifts , albeit with poorer statistics : @xmath141 binaries in total , rather than per bin .",
    "thanks to the poorer statistics , we can not resolve the small polar subpeaks in the distribution of @xmath134 .",
    "in addition , in some cases it appears that the side peaks can be larger than the central peak in the distribution of @xmath150 . aside from these minor variations , the shapes and relative amplitudes seen in these distributions",

    "we now calculate @xmath151 binaries in each bin ; the results are shown in figure [ fig : phidependence ] .",
    "the errors have a very weak ( although nonzero ) dependence on @xmath114 : the maximum deviation from the overall median is only @xmath570 .",
    "this is to be expected ; as discussed at the beginning of this section , the randomness of our binaries merger times effectively averages over azimuth .",
    "if we did not average over azimuth in this way , we would expect a moderately strong @xmath114-dependence due to the functional form of _ lisa _ s response to gws . even after averaging this dependence away",
    ", we might expect some residual @xmath114 structure due to the `` rolling '' motion of the _ lisa _ constellation .",
    "the phase associated with _",
    "s roll angle puts an additional oscillation on the measured waves ( see the @xmath571-dependence in eqs .  [ 47 ] and [ 48 ] of k07 , where @xmath571 encodes the roll angle ) , and we do not average over this angle . indeed , on close inspection , we can make out roughly two peaks in each plot in figure [ fig : phidependence ] ( although the statistics are still too poor to resolve them clearly ) , consistent with the @xmath572 and @xmath573 behavior shown in k07 . for comparison",
    ", we also examined the @xmath114-dependence for this mass and redshift with precession `` turned off . ''",

    "we show these data both in ecliptic and galactic coordinates .",
    "note that most of the region of small error lies outside of the galactic plane .",
    "this potentially bodes well for searches for mbhb electromagnetic counterparts  the regions where instruments like _ lisa _ `` see '' most sharply are less likely to be hidden by foreground features .",
    "certain portions of the sky that _ lisa _ sees well will be easier to search telescopically than others",
    ". it will be an important task for future surveys over all electromagnetic bands to identify regions that are particularly amenable to finding counterparts to mbhb events .",
    "as discussed at length in paper i , accounting for the general relativistic precession of the angular momentum vectors in an mbhb system has a dramatic impact on what we can learn by observing the system s gravitational waves .",
    "spin - induced precession breaks degeneracies among different parameters , making it possible to measure them more accurately than they could be determined if precession were not present .",
    "this has a particularly important impact on our ability to locate such a binary on the sky and to determine its luminosity distance  the degeneracy between sky angles , distance , and orientation angles is severe in the absence of precession .",
    "our analysis shows that the improvement that precession imparts to measurement accumulates fairly slowly . in using one code which includes the impact of spin precession and a second which neglects this effect",
    ", we find little difference in the accuracy with which gws determine sky position and distance for times more than a few days in advance of the final merger .",
    "the difference between the two codes grows quite rapidly in these final days . in the last day alone",
    ", the localization ellipse area decreases by a factor of @xmath26 ( up to @xmath27 in a few low - mass systems ) when precession effects are included .",
    "distance determination is likewise improved by factors of @xmath3 in that final day .",
    "not all of the precession effects occur in the final days .",
    "we saw in figure [ fig : axes_evol ] that the long tail of small minor axes can be seen , to some degree , throughout the inspiral .",
    "we could get lucky and find a binary with a very small value of @xmath135 weeks before merger .",
    "but the improvement in the median that we found in paper i appears to take effect only in the final days of inspiral .",
    "therefore , while precession may in fact help improve the _ final _ localization of a coalescing binary by a factor of @xmath576 in each direction , it will not be much help in _ advanced _ localization of a typical binary .",
    "nevertheless , the pixel sizes that we find are small enough that future surveys should not have too much trouble searching the region identified by gws , at least over certain ranges of mass and redshift . at @xmath4 , the gw localization ellipse is @xmath5 or smaller for most binaries as early as a month in advance of merger .",
    "( at high masses , the ellipse can be substantially larger than this a month before merger , but it shrinks rapidly , reaching a comparable size @xmath577 weeks before merger . ) this bodes well for future surveys with large fields of view that are likely to search the gw pixel for counterparts .",
    "in addition , gws determine the source luminosity distance so well that the distance errors we find are essentially irrelevant  gravitational lensing will dominate the distance error budget for all but the highest masses .",
    "as redshift increases , the gw pixel rapidly degrades , particularly for the largest masses .",
    "let us adopt @xmath34 ( the approximate lsst field of view ) as a benchmark localization for which counterpart searches may be contemplated . at @xmath161 , this benchmark",
    "is reached at merger for almost the entire range of masses we considered . as little as a day in advance of merger , however , some of the least massive and most massive systems are out of this regime .",
    "one week prior to merger , the most massive systems are barely located at all ( ellipses hundreds of square degrees or larger ) .",
    "the intermediate masses do best , but even in their cases the positions are determined with @xmath5 accuracy no earlier than a few days in advance of merger .",
    "the resolution degrades further at higher redshift . at @xmath165 , systems with @xmath578",
    "are not located more accurately than @xmath579 even at merger .",
    "smaller systems are located within @xmath5 at merger , but very few are at this accuracy even one day in advance of merger .",
    "the luminosity distance errors also increase , so much that they exceed lensing errors a few days to a week before merger at @xmath580 , and only a day before merger at @xmath165 .",
    "this degradation hurts the ability to search for counterparts by redshift and subsequently use them as standard candles .",
    "our main conclusion is that future surveys are likely to have good advanced knowledge ( a few days to one month ) of the location of mbhb coalescences at low redshift ( @xmath581 ) , but only a day s notice at most at higher redshift ( @xmath582 ) .",
    "this conclusion may be excessively pessimistic . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "recent work examining the importance of subleading harmonics of mbhb gws is finding that including harmonics beyond the leading quadrupole has an important effect on the final accuracy of position determination @xcite . for most masses ,",
    "these analyses show a factor of a few improvement in position , comparable to the improvement that we find when spin precession is added to the waveform model . for high - mass systems ,",
    "the higher harmonics increase the ( previously small ) overlap with the _ lisa _ band ; consequently , the improvement can be much larger , up to 2 or 3 orders of magnitude in area .",
    "since these two improvements arise from very different physical effects , it is likely that their separate improvements can be combined for an overall improvement significantly better than each effect on its own .",
    "we plan to test this in future work ( which is just now getting underway ) .",
    "finally , we have also studied the sky position dependence of _ lisa _ s ability to localize sources .",
    "we have found that the regions of best localization lie fairly far out of the galactic plane .",
    "however , as emphasized by n. cornish ( 2007 , private communication ) , a proper anisotropic confusion background might impact this dependence . in our calculations",
    ", we have assumed an isotropic background , neglecting the likely spatial distribution of galactic binaries .",
    "properly accounting for this background is likely to strengthen our conclusion that lisa s ability to `` see '' is best for mbhb sources out of the galactic plane .",
