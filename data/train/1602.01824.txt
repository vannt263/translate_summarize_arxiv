    "the reason of the changes can be elucidated by analyzing the variations of the charge separation in the system .    in fig .",

    "the charge configurations seem to be sensitive not only to the e - field but also the stacking order of the layers .",
    "firstly , the charge variations of the sn atoms of the bottom and the top layers are positive which indicates that the e - field shifts electron around the sn atoms . on the other hand , the behaviors of the changes on the s atoms are different according being at the outer or the inner part of the bilayer system .",
    "the outer s atoms have less electrons under e - field while inner s atoms attain more electrons . as an exception to these trends , the charge of the s atoms is not altered much by the e - field for the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 stackings .",

    "the polarization still exists and is enhanced at the inner s atoms of @xmath24 and all s atoms of @xmath25 stacking .",
    "more importantly , the number of electron increases gradually between the layers with electric field strength for both the @xmath24 and the @xmath25 stackings .",
    "this charge accumulation between the layers is consistent with the study of ramasubramaniam _ _ et al.__@xcite where the mos@xmath0 bilayer is tuned by the external e - field and the charge distribution between the layers was gradually enhanced with increasing out of plane e - field . according to our results , the perpendicular e - field increases the coupling between the sns@xmath0 layers for @xmath24 stacking as compared to @xmath25 .",

    "[ bands_efield ] . under the e - field ,",
    "the vbm approaches to @xmath6 point while the cbm at @xmath30 point drops in energy which means that band gap decreases .",
    "the drop of band gap with e - field is slower for the @xmath24 stacking , so under @xmath36 v /  e - field , the @xmath25 become semi - metal while the @xmath24 stacked bilayer is semiconductor with band gap 85 mev within gga .",
    "although this is the underestimated band gap , the trend of change on electronic structure together with enhanced stacking strength at @xmath24 order indicates that perpendicular e - field is useful method for tunning the band gap of bilayer sns@xmath0 which is needed in a material for the field effect transistor application .",

    "[ charging_fig ] ( a ) and ( b ) , we show respectively the barriers forms along the armchair and the zig - zag directions for four different charging conditions . positive value of charging refers to extra electrons .",
    "first of all , it is interesting that the 0.2 @xmath41 and also the 0.1 @xmath41 ( per unit cell ) cases result in a minimum energy for the @xmath25 stacking instead of @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , the barrier height decreases in all charging conditions and the shape of the barrier differs considerably for the armchair direction .",
    "moreover , the maximum barrier height in the zig - zag direction decreases down to @xmath120 mev which is comparable with the thermal energy at room temperature ( 25 mev ) .",
    "the effect of charging can be understood by monitoring the charge localizations for @xmath24 and @xmath25 stacking .",
    "therefore , in fig .",
    "[ charging_fig](c ) , the cross section of the charge density differences between the charged and the bare systems is shown for @xmath24 and @xmath25 stackings .",
    "it is expected that only positively charged regions to appear in the plot for the electron subtracted system . for the electron - added system ,",
    "the expectation is the opposite .",
    "however the occurrence of both positive and negative regions for each charging case indicates that charging ( positive or negative ) modifies the distribution of the other electrons . in fig .",
    "[ charging_fig](c ) , it is explicitly seen that the inserted charges accumulate to the outer surfaces ( red for positive charges and blue for the negative charges ) of the bilayer system . in all cases , except the 0.2 @xmath41 added to @xmath24 stacking , the electrons ( blue region ) also accumulate to the region between the layers .",
    "when we compare the @xmath24 and @xmath25 stackings in all charging conditions , the lower energy case has always a larger amount of electrons ( negative charge means blue region ) between the layers which indicates that the interactions between the layers have covalent character .",

    "however , the energy of bilayer sns@xmath45 in 1 t is different for @xmath24 and @xmath25 stackings .",

    "starting from the monolayer , the electronic and the optical properties of bilayer sns@xmath0 are investigated within first principles dft calculations .",
    "we found that the interaction between the layers is weaker than that of mos@xmath0 and other common tmds .",
    "we showed that although the layers interact weakly the energy band gaps and the absorbance spectra could be informative about the stacking type of the bilayer system .",
