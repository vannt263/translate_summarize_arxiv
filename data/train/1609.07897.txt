    "the recent financial crisis revealed weaknesses in the financial regulatory framework when it comes to the protection against systemic events .",
    "before , it was generally accepted to measure the risk of financial institutions on a stand alone basis . in the aftermath of the financial crisis risk assessment of financial systems as well as",
    "their impact on the real economy has become increasingly important , as is documented by a rapidly growing literature ; see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite for a survey and the references therein .",
    "parts of this literature are concerned with designing appropriate risk measures for financial systems , so - called systemic risk measures .",
    "the aim of this paper is to axiomatically characterize the class of systemic risk measures @xmath0 which admit a decomposition of the following form : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a state - wise aggregation function over the @xmath3-dimensional random risk factors @xmath4 of the financial system , e.g.  profits and losses at a given future time horizon , and @xmath5 is a univariate risk measure .",
    "the aggregation function determines how much a single risk factor contributes to the total risk @xmath6 of the financial system in every single state , whereas the so - called base risk measure @xmath5 quantifies the risk of @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite first introduced axioms for systemic risk measures , and showed that these admit a decomposition of type .",
    "their studies relied on a finite state space and were carried out in an unconditional framework .",
    "@xcite extend this to arbitrary probability spaces , but keep the unconditional setting .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are :    * we axiomatically characterize systemic risk measures of type in a conditional framework , in particular we consider conditional aggregation functions and conditional base risk measures in .",
    "* we allow for a very general structure of the aggregation , which is flexible enough to cover examples from the literature which could not be handled in axiomatic approaches to systemic risk so far .",
    "* we work in a less restrictive axiomatic setting , which gives us the flexibility to study systemic risk measures which for instance need not necessarily be convex or quasi - convex , etc .",
    "this again provides enough flexibility to cover a vast amount of systemic risk measures applied in practice or proposed in the literature .",
    "it also allows us to identify the relation between properties of @xmath0 and properties of @xmath2 and @xmath5 , and in particular the mechanisms behind the transfer of properties from @xmath0 to @xmath2 and @xmath5 , and vice versa .",
    "this is related to the following point 4 .",
    "* we identify the underlying structure of the decomposition by defining systemic risk measures solely in terms of so called risk - consistent properties and properties on constants .",
    "in the following we will elaborate on the points 1.4 .  above .",

    "the standard motivation for considering conditional univariate risk measures ( see e.g.  @xcite and @xcite ) is the conditioning in time , and the argumentation in favor of this also carries over to multivariate risk measures .",
    "however , apart from a dynamic assessment of the risk of a financial system , it might be particularly interesting to consider conditioning in space . in that respect @xcite recently introduced and studied so - called spatial risk measures for univariate risks .",
    "typical examples of spatial conditioning are conditioning on events representing the whole financial system or parts of that system , such as single financial institutions , in distress .",
    "this is done to study the impact of such a distress on ( parts of ) the financial system or the real economy , and thereby to identify systemically relevant structures .",
    "for instance the conditional value at risk ( covar ) introduced in @xcite considers for @xmath7 the @xmath8-quantile of the distribution of the netted profits / losses of a financial system @xmath9 conditional on a crisis event @xmath10 of institution @xmath11 : @xmath12 see .",

    "@xmath14 represents the total profit / loss after the netting of all single profits / losses .",
    "however , such an aggregation rule might not always be reasonable when measuring systemic risk .",
    "the major drawbacks of this aggregation function in the context of financial systems are that profits can be transferred from one institution to another and that losses of a financial institution can not trigger additional contagion effects .",
    "those deficiencies are overcome by aggregation functions which explicitly account for contagion effects within a financial system .",
    "for instance , based on the approach in @xcite , the authors in @xcite introduce such an aggregation rule which however , due to the more restrictive axiomatic setting , exhibits the unrealistic feature that in case of a clearing of the system institutions might decrease their liabilities by more than their total debt level .",
    "we will present a more realistic extension of this contagion model together with a small simulation study in .",
    "moreover , we present reasonable aggregation functions which are not comprised by the axiomatic framework of @xcite or @xcite . in particular this",

    "we will show that this leads to two different classes of axioms for conditional systemic risk measures .",
    "one class concerns the behavior on deterministic risks , so - called properties on constants .",
    "the other class of axioms ensures a consistency between state - wise and global - in the sense of over all states - risk assessment .",
    "this latter class will be called risk - consistent properties .",
    "the risk - consistent properties ensure a consistency between local - that is @xmath15-wise - risk assessment and the measured global risk .",
    "for example , _ risk - antitonicity _ is expressed by : if for given risk vectors @xmath4 and @xmath16 it holds that @xmath17 in almost all states @xmath18 , then @xmath19 .",
    "the naming _ risk - antitonicity _ , and analogously the naming for the other risk - consistent properties , is motivated by the fact that antitonicity is considered with respect to the order relation @xmath20 induced by the @xmath15-wise risk comparison of two positions and not with respect to the usual order relation on the space of random vectors",
    ".    note that for a univariate risk measure @xmath0 which is constant on constants , i.e.  @xmath21 for all @xmath22 , risk - antitonicity is equivalent to the classical antitonicity with respect to the usual order relation on the underlying space of random variables . in a general multivariate setting",
    "this equivalence does not hold anymore .",
    "however , we will show that properties on constants in conjunction with corresponding risk - consistent properties imply the classical properties on the space of risks .",
    "this makes our risk model very flexible , since we may identify systemic risk measures where for example the corresponding aggregation function @xmath2 in is concave , but the base risk measure @xmath5 is not convex .",
    "moreover , it will turn out that the properties on constants basically determine the underlying aggregation rule in the systemic risk assessment , whereas the risk - consistent properties translate to properties of the base risk measure in the decomposition .",
    "some of the risk - consistent properties , however partly under different names , also appear in the frameworks of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for instance what we will call risk - antitonicity is called preference consistency in @xcite . in our framework",
    "we emphasize the link between the risk - consistent properties ( and the properties on constants ) and the decomposition .",
    "this aspect has not been clearly worked out so far .",

    "when deriving our main results we will run into similar problems as one faces in the study of stochastic processes : at some point it will not be sufficient to work on equivalence classes , but we will need a specific nice realization or version of the process , for instance a version with continuous paths , etc . in the following , by a realization of a function @xmath46 we mean a selection of one representative in the equivalence class @xmath47 for each @xmath48 , i.e.  a function @xmath49 where @xmath50 with @xmath51 for all @xmath52 .",

    "on @xmath89 .",

    "our definition of a csrm is based on properties on constants together with risk - consistent properties .",
    "it turns out ( see ) that the properties on constants translate into the corresponding properties of the ( conditional ) aggregation function and the risk - consistent properties translate into the corresponding properties of the ( conditional ) base risk measure in the decomposition of a csrm .",

    "in general , it will turn out ( see ) that properties on constants combined with the corresponding risk - consistent properties will imply properties such as antitonicity , ( quasi- ) convexity or positive homogeneity of @xmath53 on @xmath99 .",
    "for example , antitonicity on constants in conjunction with risk - antitonicity implies antitonicity on @xmath99 .",
    "one might ask in which setting it is possible to formulate the risk - consistent properties directly in terms of the function @xmath53 without requiring the existence of a particular realization of this function . as we will see in the next",

    "for instance institution 2 can transfer losses up to 227 , but it is also the institution which is the least exposed to the market , which makes it also the least systemic important institution .",
    "contrarily institution 4 is the most exposed institution , but does not have the ability to transmit those losses which also results in a low position in the systemic importance ranking .",
    "finally institution 5 or 8 are very vulnerable to the market and have the largest total interbank liabilities and are thus identified as the most systemic institutions .",
