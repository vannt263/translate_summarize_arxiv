    "the existence of the uhe cosmic rays , after their discovery almost half a century ago , remains still puzzling . in advent of the new giant experiment named in honour of pierre auger , there are many proposals to explain their origin .",
    "uhe cosmic rays ( uhecr ) seem to be extragalactic because their arrival directions are not correlated with the galactic disk .",
    "thus , sites of their origin should be _ different _ from normal galaxies ( like our galaxy ) . in this work we check the hypothesis that the powerful luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) might be the uhecr sources .",
    "large fraction of bright ir galaxies are found to be interacting systems , suggesting that collision and merging processes are mostly responsible in triggering the huge ir light emission @xcite .",
    "fraction of interacting systems increases with ir luminosity and in the population of the most ir luminous objects in the universe almost all appear as gravitationally interacting .",
    "favourable environments for accelerating particles to uhe regime via the first order fermi process are provided by amplified magnetic fields on the scale of tens kpc resulting from gravitational compression , as well as high relative velocities of galaxies and/or superwinds from multiple supernovae explosions @xcite .",
    "there have been several observational claims that colliding galaxies could be possible sites of the uhecr origin .",
    "al - dargazelli @xcite have proposed that some clustering of uhecr shower directions above 10 eev ev ] are associated with nearby colliding galaxies .",
    "uchihori @xcite have analysed combined world data from northern hemisphere experiments and concluded that two triplets and a doublet lie in a vicinity of interacting systems .",
    "takeda @xcite have noticed that the interacting galaxy vv 141 at z=0.02 is a possible candidate for the triplet of events above 50 eev from the agasa experiment .",
    "however , as we shall show , there is another favourable candidate for the origin of this uhecr cluster - arp 299 ( mrk171 , vv 118a / b ) , a member of lirg class of extragalactic objects .",
    "this system ( ra@xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , consisting of two interacting starburst galaxies , is the closest extragalactic object ( distance 42 mpc for @xmath2 ) with ir luminosity greater than @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and it is the brightest ir source within 70 mpc .",
    "such high ir luminosity is related to young and violent star forming regions .",
    "there is also observational evidence of superwind outflows , large scale strong radio emissions and the estimated supernova rate is about 0.6 per year @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of the present paper is to check whether the lirgs could be the sites of origin of the uhecrs observed at the earth . using the pscz catalogue @xcite",
    "we construct the all - sky maps of uhe proton intensities originating in lirgs , taking into account effects of particle propagation through the extragalactic medium and , as an example , possible influence of the regular galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) .",
    "we check both hypotheses : origin in lirgs and , on the other hand , the isotropic distribution of the experimental data above 40 eev from agasa @xcite , using various statistical tests .",
    "the pscz catalogue consists of almost 15000 ir galaxies with known redshifts , covering 84% of the sky .",
    "it should be noted that observational limitations cause that some of the extragalactic objects may not have measured redshifts or may be even unobserved in the dust obscured regions within the disk of the galaxy ( the so called zone of avoidance ) .",

    "on inspection of the superimposed directions of the agasa showers above 40 eev we can find only a few cases where experimental events lie in the vicinity of excluded regions , which should not affect much our analysis . as the potential uhecr sources we have selected objects with luminosities in the far infrared ( fir ) range exceeding lirg limit @xmath5 , that is over one order of magnitude greater than the estimated fir luminosity of our galaxy @xcite , and with distances up to 1 gpc , giving the total number of 2811 sources ( figure 1 , bottom ) . a large fraction of such objects show to be in an apparent stage of collision and merging .     and with distances up to 1 gpc",

    "* cr propagate through the intergalactic medium , where they are scattered and suffer energy losses on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite .    to calculate cr arrival directions",
    "we have derived an analytical formula for the distribution of the deflection angles , for the multiple small angle scattering in weak irregular magnetic fields with continuous energy losses taken into account ( see appendix a ) . since strength and structure of the extragalactic magnetic field are largely unknown , we adopt here the upper limit for this field magnitude and coherence scale : @xmath9 , as measured by faraday rotation of radio signals from distant quasars @xcite . because the analysis is strongly energy dependent , we consider two energy regions 40 to 80 eev and above 80 eev , where this limit is just about the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) flux cut - off predicted from cr interactions with the 2.7 k cmb radiation @xcite .",

    "no correlation of the data events above 80 eev with the expected cr intensities can be seen ( figure 3 ) .",

    "however some of the showers from this group lie close to the region heavily obscured by the galactic disk .",
    "the global regular gmf structure is not well known .",
    "analyses of rotation measures of pulsars and extragalactic radio sources suggest that the gmf has a bisymmetric spiral ( bss ) form with field directions reversed from arm to arm @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by the observed value of the pitch angle of the local field and number of field reversals within the galactic disk @xcite . to examine the influence of the regular gmf on the extragalactic uhe fluxes we have chosen the bisymmetric spiral model with field reversals and odd parity ( bss - a ) adopted from stanev @xcite . because the predictions are strongly model dependent , and the procedure applied",
    "gives a rather simplified picture , the analysis presented here is only an example of the possible extragalactic cr flux distortion .",
    "it is presented for the lower energy range 40 - 80 eev , where the effect is stronger and easily visible .",
    "+ simulations of a large number of monoenergetic antiprotons ejected from the earth and followed to the halo border through gmf give flux modification factors depending on directions in the extragalactic sky .",
    "then , for an assumed flux distribution of protons at the galactic borders we are able to calculate their fluxes at the earth .",
    "distortion effects i.e. reduction or magnification and shifting of the particle fluxes are visible in figure 2 ( bottom ) .",
    "the modification of the extragalactic uhecr intensities due to the influence of the gmf bss - a model seems to worsen the correlation with the experimental data seen in the upper figure .",
    "to check the hypotheses of isotropic and anisotropic distribution of the experimental data above 40 eev from agasa , we have used smirnov - cramer - von mises ( scvm ) free of binning test @xcite , modified for a 2-dimensional distribution analysis .",

    "although the four obtained @xmath24 values are not completely independent , they provide a valuable insight into the analysis . results of tested hypotheses : isotropy and lirgs anisotropy ( with and without gmf ) , energies 40 - 80 eev and above 80 eev are shown in table 1 .",

    ". however , the point calculated by us for the same agasa data ( star ) has a lower strength value and lies on the isotropy distribution .",

    "we can see that samples of the 47 events simulated from lirgs anisotropy scenario , show good resemblance to the experimental data distribution .",
    "the strongest evidence for uhecrs origin may come from the correlation between directions of the agasa triplet of events with energies 53.5 , 55.0 and 77.6 eev and an energetic astrophysical source in the local universe .",
    "so far arp 299 is the best candidate as a member of lirgs , the brightest infrared source within 70 mpc and a system of colliding galaxies showing intense , violent starburst activity at only 42 mpc away . it should be noted that arp 299 appeared earlier as vv 118 in the list of candidates for the agasa triplet presented by takeda @xcite but was not recognized as a colliding , energetic system , and , as a result , was not given enough attention .",
    "these authors point to another object vv 141 being a colliding system at z=0.02 .",
    "however , as arp 299 is at a distance two times smaller and fulfils the necessary criteria for cr acceleration , we think that it is this object which could be the most probable cr source .",
    "+ recent studies on the nature of lirgs suggest that compact strong radio emission may result from frequent multiple luminous radio supernovae @xcite .",
    "these objects are a poorly known class of supernovae with high nonthermal radio power indicating large kinetic energy input to accelerate particles @xcite . in systems with intense starburst activity in extremely dense molecular gas and strong magnetic field environment , `` nearly every supernova explosion results in a luminous radio sn with very high radio power ''",
    "it is also worth to note that there are some observations suggesting a relationship between gamma ray bursts ( grb ) and supernovae explosions @xcite .",
    "very recently weiler @xcite have stated that grb980425 and radio loud supernova sn1998bw are possibly related .",
    "thus , it is not unreasonable to invoke here the intriguing hypothesis of the common origin of the two most energetic , mysterious phenomena in the universe , uhecrs and grbs .",
    "we have shown that the available data from agasa in the energy range 40 to 80 eev are not in contradiction with the expected anisotropy of cr produced in lirgs .",
    "after applying the gmf , the lirg hypothesis passes as well , but an apparent worse agreement with the data , suggests that the gmf model used by us may not be appropriate .",
    "so , we may hope that , if point sources existed they would be useful for determining the global structure of the gmf . at energies above 80 eev both the isotropic and the lirgs anisotropic distribution hypotheses",
    "are rejected .",
    "this might be explained by an existence of a uhecr population of a different origin above gzk cut - off .",
    "+ however , it seems that the scvm test used here is not conclusive for distinguishing between the isotropy and the lirgs distributions .",
    "contrary to calculations done by other author , the eigenvector analysis has also appeared unable to do this for the existing sample sizes .",
    "thus , we have considered a small scale clustering rather than a large scale anisotropy .",
    "indeed , the analysis of multiplet probability gives good discrimination between isotropic and anisotropic scenarios ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the probability of the occurring of two doublets and one triplet ( three doublets and one triplet ) is 10 ( 20 ) times higher for the lirg hypothesis than that for isotropy .",
    "the analysis of the distributions of the angular distances between the data and simulated lirg events also supports an existence of a correlation ( figure 6 ) . the strongest argument for our hypothesis is the observation of the triplet from the direction of arp299 , a system of colliding galaxies .",
    "we have obtained , via simulations , a high probability of doublets and triplets from this source , estimated to be about 0.5 .",
