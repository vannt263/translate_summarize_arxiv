    "even in the vacuum state , the electromagnetic field exhibits quantum fluctuations @xcite which manifest themselves through the macroscopic casimir forces @xcite .    these forces can be understood as resulting from the radiation pressure exerted by the scattered fluctuations and they depend upon the reflection coefficients which characterize the boundaries .",
    "assuming that the boundaries are transparent at high frequencies , which is certainly the case for any real mirrors , one obtains expressions free from the divergences usually associated with the infiniteness of the vacuum energy @xcite .    in this formulation of the casimir effect , the force is related to the vacuum stress tensor evaluated on the boundaries and is itself a fluctuating quantity . as illustrated by the langevin theory of brownian motion @xcite , any fluctuating force has a long term cumulative effect . here",
    "a motional force for a mirror in vacuum can be deduced from linear response theory @xcite and it is connected to the fluctuations through some ` fluctuation - dissipation relations ' . a force has yet been derived for a perfectly reflecting mirror moving in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) spacetime @xcite ; it is dissipative and proportional to the third time derivative of the mirror s position @xmath0 ( in a linear approximation with respect to @xmath0 ) @xmath1 ( from now on , we use natural units where @xmath2 ; however , we keep @xmath3 as a scale for vacuum fluctuations ) .",
    "this force results from a motional modification of the vacuum stress tensor and is connected to the casimir forces .",
    "actually , both effects are present when the motion of two mirrors is studied @xcite .",
    "however , the expression ( 1 ) of the force does not exhibit the causal properties which are expected from the linear response theory .",
    "a related effect has been studied in great detail since it limits the sensitivity of the interferometers designed for gravitational wave detection @xcite . when irradiated by a laser wave ,",
    "a mirror undergoes a fluctuating radiation pressure @xcite as well as a damping force proportional to its velocity and to the laser intensity @xcite .",
    "however , the discussion of these effects has not taken into account the fact that they remain at the limit of a null laser intensity ; the radiation pressure fluctuates also in the vacuum and this causes an extra mirror s damping .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the simplest case where a point like mirror is placed in the stationary state of a scalar field in a 2d spacetime ( with the vacuum as a particular case ) .",
    "the field scattering upon the mirror is characterized by frequency dependent transmissivity and reflectivity functions obeying unitarity , causality and high frequency transparency conditions .",
    "first , we derive the radiation pressure exerted upon a motionless mirror .",
    "then , we study the motional modification of the field scattering ( at first order in the mirror s displacement ) and obtain a causal expression for the motional force .",
    "we exhibit the relation connecting this force with the fluctuations of the radiation pressure computed for a motionless mirror .",
    "these results are demonstrated for any stationary state of the input fields . at the end of the paper ,",
    "we give the particular expressions for the vacuum state . equation ( 1 )",
    "is reproduced at frequencies well below the reflection cutoff .",
    "finally , the motional force is connected with the squeezing of vacuum field , as put into evidence by the expression of the effective hamiltonian describing the mirror s motion in the linear approximation .",

    "two properties of the noise spectrum ( 35 ) have to be emphasized .",
    "first , @xmath89 is zero at the limit of a null frequency , which means that the force fluctuations are averaged to zero when integrated over a long time .",
    "note that the input impulsion density @xmath87 also vanishes when integrated over a long time .",
    "second , the relation ( 35 ) between the noise spectrum @xmath89 and the spectral density @xmath107 implies that the noise spectrum contains only positive frequency components , because the vacuum is the zero temperature state .",
    "it follows that the vacuum can damp the mirror s motion but can not excite it .",

    "the effect of the mirror s motion is described by a modification of the @xmath34matrix in the laboratory or by a transformation of the input stress tensor in the comoving frame .",
    "it can be noted that the scattering formalism has already been used for dealing with vacuum fluctuations in accelerated frames or in curved space @xcite .    in this scattering approach ,",
    "the damping force for a mirror in the vacuum appears as connected to squeezing @xcite . in order to put this point into evidence",

    "it follows that the squeezing effect vanishes when the oscillation frequency goes to zero .",
    "a mirror moving slowly in the vacuum does not appreciably squeeze it and the motional force ( 1 ) is very small at low frequencies .",
    "the connection of the motional force with squeezing can be analysed also in the comoving frame .",
    "now , the apparent input state ( 22 ) is itself squeezed when the input is the vacuum in the laboratory frame .",

    "we have given the explicit expressions of the correlation functions and of the motional force experienced by a mirror in the vacuum state .",
    "when the mirror is irradiated by a coherent wave , the same method leads to a mean radiation pressure and to extra fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it also provides an extra damping force , proportional to the mirror s velocity and to the coherent field intensity @xcite .",
