    "in the past twenty years artificial neural networks ( anns ) have remarkably established their role as a computational tool in high energy physics analyses .",
    "important applications have been developed that provide , for instance , classification methods for off - line jet identification and tracking , non - classification - type tools for on - line process control / event trigger and mass reconstruction , and optimization techniques in _ e.g. _ track finding @xcite .",
    "more recently , anns have been proposed as a theoretical tool to address the problem of the extraction of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) from high energy scattering processes . in a series of papers",
    "@xcite the authors developed the neural networks pdfs ( nnpdfs ) .",
    "nnpdfs differ from standard global analyses in that they avoid the bias that is introduced when a particular parametric functional form for the pdfs is adopted . relying on an initial pdf form is instead a fundamental assumption in standard analyses . in nnpdfs",
    "each pdf is parameterized with a redundant functional form given by a neural network with 37 free parameters represented by the anns weights .",
    "the parametric forms are subsequently fitted to the experimental data , and their @xmath0 is minimized using a genetic algorithm @xcite .",
    "what distinguishes this approach from the standard ones is , besides an improved statistical analysis , the automated minimization procedure which has the _ advantage _ of eliminating the user s bias in extracting pdfs from experimental data .",
    "in fact , no physical assumption goes into determining the shape of the parametrization , rather the physical behavior is inferred directly from the data in terms of smooth pdf curves .",
    "this feature turns , however , into a _ disadvantage _ in kinematical regions where there is no experimental information , or in between the data points if the data are sparse : due to the inherent unbiasedness nnpdfs can not be sensibly extrapolated to kinematical regions with few or no data , starting from their behavior in regions where data do exist . in other words , since for nnpdfs the effect of modifying individual nn parameters is unknown ",
    "the weights are in a non tunable , hidden layer ",
    "the result might not be under control in the extrapolation region .",
    "the ability to extrapolate is , however , often a desirable feature in the performance of a fit to high energy physics data .",
    "it is even more important for extracting and processing physics information from a new generation of experiments that go beyond the inclusive scattering ones intensively studied so far .",
    "the newly accessible experiments include besides the lhc high energy frontier , semi - inclusive and exclusive scattering reactions with both unpolarized and polarized variables in the kinematical regimes accessible at rhic and at jefferson lab@xmath112 gev . in the new lhc era it is of the utmost importance to provide methods to carefully extract the soft matrix elements , including pdfs and their uncertainties with methods that are apt to handle and interpret the increasingly complicated , and diverse sets of observations . in this contribution",
    "we present an alternative approach based on self - organizing maps ( soms ) @xcite .",
    "soms are also anns where , however , the basic learning algorithm is replaced by an _ unsupervised learning _ one that makes use of the underlying _ self - organizing _ properties of the network s input vectors  in our case the pdfs .",
    "unsupervised learning works without knowledge about what features characterize the output : data are organized according to certain attributes without any `` teaching '' .",
    "a most important aspect of the som algorithm is in its ability of projecting high dimensional _ input _ data onto lower dimensions representations while preserving the topological features present in the _ training _ data .",
    "results using this technique can be represented as 2d geometrical configurations where one can visualize a neighborhood of nodes being simultaneously updated while reproducing the clustering of the data s features .",
    "the 2d visualization features are characteristic of a map .    in this contribution",
    "we present results obtained by restructuring the original sompdf code @xcite in such a way that we obtain directly smooth , continuous types of solutions for which a fully quantitative error analysis can be implemented .",
    "also , our new code is now sufficiently flexible to allow for analyses of different observables including both the unpolarized and polarized inclusive type structure functions , and the matrix elements for deeply virtual exclusive processes ( generalized parton distributions , gpds ) , and semi - inclusive processes ( transverse momentum distributions , tmds ) .",
    "our first quantitative results for the unpolarized case using next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd were shown in refs.@xcite . here",
    "we present some of the intermediate results defining the working of sompdf .",
    "the som algorithm consists of three stages : _",
    "i ) initialization _ ; _ ii ) training _ ; _ iii ) mapping_. each cell ( neuron ) is sensitized to a different domain of vectors .    _",
    "i ) initialization _    during the initialization",
    "procedure weight vectors of dimension @xmath2 are associated to each cell , @xmath3 , @xmath4\\ ] ] @xmath5 are given spatial coordinates , _",
    "i.e. _ one defines the geometry / topology of a 2d map that gets populated randomly with @xmath5 .    _",
    "i ) training _    for the training , a set of input data , @xmath6 , \\ ] ] ( isomorphic to @xmath5 )",
    "is then presented to @xmath5 , or compared by calculating the distance , @xmath7 , between each pair of vectors via a  similarity metric \" that we choose to be @xmath8 ( euclidean distance ) @xmath9 the most similar weight vector is the best matching unit ( bmu ) .",
    "soms are based on unsupervised and  competitive \" learning .",
    "this means that the cells that are closest to the bmu activate each other in order to  learn \" from @xmath10 .",
    "practically , the bmu , and the neighboring map vectors within a radius defined adjust their values according to a learning principle defined by , @xmath11    % \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; i \\in n_c(n ) \\\\",
    "% v_i(n+1 ) & = & v_i(n ) \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; i   \\!\\not\\in   n_c(n)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the iteration number ; @xmath12 is the _ learning function _ ; @xmath13 is the _ neighborhood function _ for the bmu defined as a circle of decreasing radius .",
    "both @xmath13 , and @xmath12 , decrease monotonically with @xmath2 , so that an initial global ordering is established at the first iteration , while the subsequent iterations yield more specific adjustments . in our case",
    "we use square maps of size @xmath14 , and @xmath15 where in our case , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the ( variable ) total number of iterations , @xmath18 defines the monotonically decreasing radius , and @xmath19 .    _",
    "iii ) mapping _    at the end of a properly trained som , cells that are topologically close to each other will contain data which are similar to each other . in the final phase the actual data",
    "gets distributed on the map and clusters emerge .",
    "since each map vector now represent a class of similar objects , the som is an ideal tool to visualize high - dimensional data , by projecting it onto a low - dimensional map clustered according to some desired similar feature . in what follows we apply these ideas to pdf fitting",
    "as an illustrative example we fit a subset of all available dis data .",
    "our fit uses soms to generate and classify possible  candidate \" distribution functions . a genetic algorithm ( ga )",
    "is subsequently applied .    in the initialization stage , a set of database / input pdfs is formed by randomly selecting them from a range of functional forms tabulated as functions of @xmath20 .",
    "the input vectors could be in principle chosen completely at random . however , in all practical som applications , some initial ordering limiting the type and number of possible map vectors is given @xcite . in our case , the goal is to obtain a stochastic ensemble that still preserves the smoothness of the curves .",
    "the initial pdfs are constructed to be linear combinations of functions of a similar form to the ones provided by existing global analyses parametrization sets @xcite . for each parameterization",
    "set we perform random variations on the _ parameters _ , instead than on the functions values themselves .",
    "baryon number and momentum sum rules are imposed at every step . from our initial analysis",
    "we obtained that it is sufficient to combine three different pdf types in order to achive both the required smoothness and variety / randomness .",
    "this constitutes a considerable improvement over the various initialization procedures tested in @xcite in that no smoothing techniques are now required .",
    "the input pdfs , are connected through evolution , and convoluted with the pqcd coefficient functions at nlo .",
    "a subset of the input pdfs is finally placed on the map .    for the training stage ,",
    "a different subset of the input pdfs is used .",
    "the similarity between our map cell vectors and the code vectors is computed by comparing the pdfs , according to eqs.([learn_1],[learn_2.1],[learn_2.2],[learn_2.3 ] ) . at given @xmath21 and @xmath22 values .",
    "the new map pdfs are obtained by averaging the neighboring pdfs with the bmu .",
    "once the map is trained , the ga is implemented .",
    "the @xmath0 per input pdfs is calculated with respect to the experimental data .",
    "we then take a subset of these functions with the best @xmath0 , and use them as seeds to form a new set of input pdfs .",
    "we train the map with the new set of input pdfs and repeat the process .",
    "the @xmath0 was found to decrease towards @xmath23 with every ga iteration .",
    "our stopping criterion is established when the @xmath0 stops varying ( its curve flattens ) . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we show results on the dependence of the @xmath0 on the number of iterations in the ga , obtained using small size maps for illustrative purposes . the role of the different values of the algorithm s parameters can be seen .",
    "@xmath0 vs. number of iterations in the ga , obtained by fixing the values of the algorithm s parameters such as the maximum number of iterations , the maximum value of @xmath0 allowed , and the size of the map . ,",
    "width=302 ]         map for a set of 43 runs .",
    "the panels represent ( clockwise from upper left)the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 distributions , respectively , at @xmath28 gev@xmath29 .",
    "the shaded areas are our results including the error analys outlined in the text . for comparison",
    "we show also results from several other parametrizations.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in figure [ fig2 ] , we illustrate the shape and size of the envelopes constituting the initial set of map pdfs .",
    "test \" set of data from bcdms + is used .",
    "finally , in figure [ fig3 ] we show results of runs using more complete data sets , consistent with the sets used in refs .",
    "the data sets chosen were from bcdms , h1 , nmc , slac and zeus ( see _ e.g. _ references in @xcite ) .",
    "in ref.@xcite a new approach , sompdf , was presented as an alternative to the purely automated fitting procedure of nnpdf .",
    "initial results were aimed at proving the viability of the method as a fitting procedure , by successfully generating @xmath0 values that decreased with the number of iterations .",
    "these studies did not focus on the specific clustering properties of the map .",
    "the clustering features are , however , important , especially when extending the fitting procedure to a wider set of semi - inclusive and exclusive scattering experimental data which purport to extract the transverse momentum distributions ( tmds ) and generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , respectively . we believe that sompdfs are an ideal tool for analyzing these rather elusive observables because of the following reasons :    _ i ) _ the extrapolation to regions where data are scarce is feasible , since the som method does not rely on outputs for the learning process ;    _ ii ) _ visualization advantages are a key feature of soms @xcite ;    _ iii ) _ one obtains an improved physical insight on multivariable dependent phenomena .",
    "this is accomplished by first singling out the main features of the data through the clustering property of the som , , and by subsequently inspecting the content of the map cells that are sensitive to those features ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore refined the sompdf approach of ref.@xcite , and restructured the original code in such a way that on one side , smooth fitting curves are obtained and a fully quantitative error analysis can be now implemented , and on the other we have sufficient flexibility to allow for analyses of different observables , including the matrix elements for deeply virtual exclusive and semi - inclusive processes .",
    "our first quantitative results for the unpolarized case using next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd in the @xmath30 scheme were presented in ref.@xcite , and at this workshop .    based on our results we are now confident that the sompdf method stands as a viable tool for pdf analyses , which is complementary to nnpdf .",
    "it is also an essential tool to be used in more complex multivariable analyses .",
    "more work is in progress that will refine our initial results , and eventually provide pdfs with an improved error analysis .",
    "as , in fact , recently articulated in @xcite , the evaluation of the pdfs uncertainty is complicated because it originates from different experimental and theoretical sources . in particular ,",
    "the treatment of the theoretical errors can not be uniquely defined , since their correlations are not well known .",
    "our approach is currently defining statistical errors on an ensemble of sompdf runs .",
    "an evaluation using the lagrange multiplier method is in progress .",
