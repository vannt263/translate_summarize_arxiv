    "<S> different materials have been used for these elements : dielectrics , semiconductors and metals.@xcite    photonic gaps are formed at frequencies @xmath2 for sufficiently high dielectric contrast @xmath3 , because the quantity @xmath4 enters in the wave equation.@xcite thus , only metal - containing photonic crystals can maintain the necessary dielectric contrast at small frequencies due to drude - like behavior @xmath5.@xcite but the damping of electromagnetic waves in metals can suppress many useful properties of metallic photonic crystals .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest in this letter a novel type of photonic crystal consisting of _ superconducting _ elements ( embedded in dielectric media ) or inverse superconducting crystal with ( vacuum ) holes . </S>",
    "<S> this photonic crystal can be used for ( thz ) frequencies smaller than superconducting gap where the damping is negligible .    for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , we consider superconducting particles in the london approximation ( i.e. for london penetration length @xmath6^{1/2 } \\gg \\xi$ ] , @xmath7 is the coherence length ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical properties of superconductors have been extensively studied ( see , for example , refs .

    "<S> we adopt the approximation @xmath22 , which neglects damping in the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> the summation in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ substparteq ] ) goes over all lattice nodes @xmath23 characterizing positions of superconducting particles ( @xmath24 is the coordinate space vector of a superconducting particle occupying a particular node of the lattice ) .    </S>",
    "<S> here we calculate the band structure of a two - dimensional photonic crystal consisting of an infinite array of superconducting cylinders that form a square lattice . specifically , by expanding the electric field in plane waves ( the plane wave expansion method commonly used for band structure calculations of solids@xcite was applied for calculation of the band structure of 3d photonic crystal with dielectric spheres in the nodes in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ] ) we reduce the maxwell equation ( 3 ) for a superconducting photonic crystal to the following eigenvalue problem : @xmath25 where @xmath26 ; @xmath27 is the reciprocal lattice vector for 2d square lattice . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 and @xmath29 are arbitrary integers , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are 2d orthogonal vectors : if the unit cell vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 of the 2d square lattice are oriented along @xmath34 and @xmath35 real space unit vectors , then @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 being the lattice spacing . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath39 are the fourier components of the electric field eigenfunction @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath41 is related to the fourier transform of the periodic dielectric function in this superconducting photonic crystal : @xmath42 where @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the filling factor of the superconductor(@xmath45 is the cross - sectional area of the cylinder [ in the the plane perpendicular to the cylinder axis ] ; @xmath18 is the the total area occupied by the lattice unit cell , @xmath46 is the cylinder radius , @xmath38 is the lattice spacing ) ; finally , @xmath47 is a bessel function .    </S>",
    "<S> the band structure for the filling factor @xmath48 and @xmath49 is presented on fig.1 ( we use as the unit of frequency the lattice frequency @xmath50).@xcite for a ybco superconductor @xmath51 , and thus @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we have picked the value of @xmath53 in units of @xmath54 to attain a significant band gap in the spectrum . since for ybco the value of @xmath55 </S>",

    "<S> the width of the photonic gap is a nonmonotonic function of the filling factor @xmath60 . a photonic gap exists only in the range @xmath61 . the widest gap ( @xmath62 ) corresponds to @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ in summary _ </S>",
    "<S> , we have obtained the band structure of a superconducting photonic crystal . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the photonic gap for the system considered is a non - monotonic function of the filling factor . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of a photonic crystal with superconducting particles is that the dissipation of the incident electromagnetic wave due to the imaginary part of the dielectric function is much greater for normal metallic than for superconducting particles , because the imaginary part of the dielectric function for superconducting particles is negligible in comparison with the imaginary part of the dielectric function for normal metal particles at frequencies smaller than the superconducting gap . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in this frequency regime , for a photonic crystal consisting of several layers of metallic scatterers the dissipation of the incident electromagnetic wave by an array of superconducting particles is expected to be less than that obtained from an analogous array composed of normal metallic particles . </S>",
    "<S> note that experimental studies of superconducting metamaterials have been carried out recently.@xcite </S>"
