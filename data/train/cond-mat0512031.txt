    ", one can consider an optical potential red - detuned with respect to the atoms and the impurity .",
    "in such an experimental realization both the atom and the impurity would feel trapping potentials .    as the atom - impurity interactions are tuned closer to @xmath9 , the growth of the peak atom density at the center of the trap",
    "can potentially be monitored experimentally in expansion experiments . since the condensate bump at the trap center involves only a few atoms , direct detection of the changes in the peak density may",
    ", however , be non - trivial .",
    "we suggest that the impurity - doped condensate could alternatively be probed in a bosenova - type experiment which applies a sequence of time - dependent magnetic field ramps  @xcite . by tuning the atom - impurity scattering length to a large negative value",
    ", one could experimentally induce collapse and consequently density oscillations , which might involve a significant fraction of the condensate atoms .",
    "a key result of our study is that the degree of localization of the impurity at the trap center in region ( b ) of the phase diagram ( see figs .  [ phase ] and [ attr_fig ] ) can be controlled by varying the atom - impurity scattering length , i.e. , the width of the impurity wave function for a system with @xmath72 can be varied from a size much greater than the oscillator length @xmath41 to a size significantly smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "in addition to changing the atom - impurity scattering length , one can consider unequal atom and impurity masses , e.g. , a cs atom immersed in a na condensate . not surprisingly , as the impurity mass increases , the degree of impurity localization also increases .",
    "the localized impurity itself may present the possibility for forming interesting single - atom devices , perhaps using the impurity s spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the favorable coherence properties of bose condensates may make the localized impurity states viable for quantum computing schemes .",
    "furthermore , extensions to two or more impurities will allow one to consider the role of condensate - mediated interactions between impurities .",
    "finally , we return to our finding that a single neutral impurity can deform the condensate sufficiently to induce a collapse which may only involve a fraction of the condensate atoms .",
    "the resulting collapsed state may be related to the mesoscopic droplets that have been predicted to form about an ion immersed in a condensate  @xcite . more work is needed to fully understand these ion states , the collapsed states predicted in the present work , and possible connections between the two .",
