    "when the conic used is a parabola , the surface is minimal and it is called catenoid ; if the conic used is a hyperbola , the surface is called a nodoid and if the conic used is an ellipse , the surface is called an unduloid . since an ellipse has two foci , the trace of each one of them generates an undoloid .",

[ flathelicoidal ]        anytime we fixed a positive function @xmath22 on the euclidean unit sphere we can define an _ anisotropic",
    "_ mean curvature for surfaces in @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath24 is the constant function @xmath25 , the anisotropic mean curvature agrees with the mean curvature .",
    "result for constant mean curvature of revolution was extended to anisotropic constant mean curvature surfaces of revolution by miyuki and palmer in 2008 , @xcite .",
    "likewise , the dynamical interpretation for helicoidal constant mean curvature , @xcite , was extended to anisotropic constant mean curvature surfaces by khuns and palmer @xcite . in the latter paper , khuns and",
    "palmer found a formula for the inverse of the operator treadmillsled . here in this paper",
    "we will elaborate more on this formula and prove some properties for the treadmillsled . for purposes of a better understanding we will find an explicit parametrization for the treadmillsled of a curve and we will be refereing to this parametrization of the treadmillsled as just @xmath26 ;",
    "in this way , @xmath26 becomes an operator that takes a parametrized regular curve into a parametrized curve .",
    "we will show that this operator acts like the derivative operator for functions .",
    "for example ,    * given @xmath8\\to \\bfr{2}$ ] , @xmath27 is an expression of @xmath6 and @xmath28 * if @xmath29 then @xmath6 and @xmath30 differ by a constant .",
    "this time the constant does not represent a translation on the graph like in the case of the derivative operator but it represents an oriented rotation that fixes the origin .",
    "more precisely , if we identify @xmath0 with the complex numbers , then @xmath31 for some constant @xmath32 .",
    "* when @xmath33 is in the image of the operator @xmath26 , there is a formula for @xmath34 that depends on @xmath33 , @xmath35 and only one antiderivative .",
    "the ambiguity of this antiderivative is responsible for the existence of the whole 1 parametric family of curves with the same treadmillsled . *",
    "if we change the orientation of @xmath6 , that is , if we consider the curve @xmath36 , then @xmath37 .",
    "if we look at figures 1.4 , 1.5 and 1.6 , we notice that the curves that are treadmillsled have the property that their velocity vector is horizontal where the curve intercepts the @xmath1 axis .",
    "this is not a coincidence , actually we will show that a curve @xmath38 is the treadmillsled of a regular curve @xmath6 if and only if    * @xmath39 for some continuous function @xmath40 and * @xmath41 is a positive function .    from the first property we see that if @xmath42 , then @xmath43 and therefore the velocity vector @xmath44 is horizontal on points along the @xmath1-axis .",
    "the second property is the reason why a whole vertical line can not be the treadmillsled of a regular curve . for a vertical line",
    ", @xmath45 always vanishes and therefore when the line touches the @xmath2-axis , the function @xmath41 vanishes making the second property fail at this point .",
    "also notice that if the vertical semi - line is contained in the @xmath1-axis , then by the relation @xmath39 , we must have that @xmath46 vanishes and therefore @xmath33 reduces to just a point .",
    "it is easy to see that the treadmillsled of a circle centered at the origin is just a point in the @xmath1-axis .",
    "notice that if the profile curve of a helicoidal surface is a circle centered at the origin then the surface is a cylinder .",
    "at the end of this paper we prove that the treadmillsled of the profile curve of a minimal helicoidal surface is either the @xmath2-axis ( when the surface is a helicoid ) , or it is a hyperbola centered at the origin .",
    "in this paper we will assume that all functions have as many derivatives as needed .",
    "let us start this section with a definition that extends the notion of treadmillsled .",
    "one of the reasons we introduce this notion is because it provides an interpretation for the curve @xmath48 when @xmath49\\to \\mathbb{c}$ ] , @xmath8\\to \\mathbb{c}$ ] are curve in the complex plane with @xmath50 , see corollary [ complexmultbycurvesins1 ] .",

    "[ independece of parameter ] notice that the definition of the @xmath54 is independent of the parametrization , it only depends on the orientation of the curve .",

    "* imagine that the curve @xmath6 is in a plane which can freely move .",
    "moreover , let us assume that there is a hole in the origin of this plane and also let us assume that we have placed a pencil in this hole . *",
    "imagine that another plane , this one fixed , contains a treadmill based at the origin with a device that allows the treadmill to incline at any angle .",
    "* the curve @xmath6 in the moving plane will generate another curve in the fixed plane , the @xmath47-treadmillsled of @xmath6 . *",

    "now , using the equation @xmath82 we get that    @xmath83    since @xmath73 , then the proposition follows .",
    "the definition of treadmillsled of a curve given in the introduction corresponds with the @xmath47-treadmillsled when @xmath47 is the zero function .",
    "sometimes we will view @xmath54 not as a set but as the parametrized curve described in ( [ parametrization of ts ] ) .    to be more precise , we will use proposition [ formula for ts ] to define the treamillsled as an operator that takes a regular parametric curve into a parametric curve .",

    "the following proposition gives us some insight about the nature of the operator @xmath47-treadmillsled defined in the set of regular curves .",
    "as we already notice , the @xmath47-treadmillsled of a curve is independent of the parametrization as long as the orientation is preserved .",
    "therefore , there is not loss of generality if we assume that the curves in the domain of the operator @xmath47-treadmillsled are parametrized by arc - length .",
