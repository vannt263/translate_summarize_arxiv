    "the magneto - electric effect in insulating materials consists in the appearance of a finite , measurable electric bulk polarization @xmath0 when a sample is subjected to an external magnetic field @xmath1 , and in the appearance of a finite , measurable bulk magnetization @xmath2 when the sample is subjected to an external electric field @xmath3 . the magneto - electric effect is quantified by the magneto - electric response tensor : @xmath4 where the derivatives are not necessarily taken at zero @xmath1 or @xmath3 fields . the effect has been observed in a variety of materials and its technological applications can be tremendous @xcite .    originally , the effect was sought in materials with broken time - reversal and inversion symmetries , but recently it was shown that certain classes of time - reversal or inversion invariant systems can display large magneto - electric responses @xcite due to topological characteristics of their electronic structures .",
    "such materials , which are now routinely synthesized and characterized in laboratories @xcite , are called 3-dimensional topological insulators .",
    "it emerged in the recent years that the 3-dimensional topological insulators can be classified by their magneto - electric response .",
    "for example , for perfectly periodic , time - reversal invariant insulators , the magneto - electric response induces a @xmath5 topological classification @xcite and the topological part of the magneto - electric tensor , which can serve as the topological invariant for this classification , was shown @xcite to equal the previously introduced @xcite @xmath5 invariants .",
    "this was an important development in the field of topological insulators because it provided a measurable bulk effect which sets apart the trivial and topological 3-dimensional time - reversal invariant insulators @xcite .",
    "the magneto - electric response has ionic , spin and orbital contributions .",
    "here we discuss only the orbital component , which , at its turn , can be decomposed into isotropic and traceless parts : @xmath6 both components are experimentally measurable quantities but we will focus exclusively on the isotropic component : @xmath7 for it contains the topological response . for perfectly periodic , time - reversal or inversion invariant crystals at zero external fields , @xmath8 was derived and explicitly computed in refs .",
    "@xcite for several lattice models of time - reversal or inversion symmetric insulators , showing that indeed @xmath8 can take non - trivial quantized values . for",
    "perfectly periodic systems without time - reversal and inversion symmetries , refs .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath8 has additional contributions besides the topological component .",
    "our goal here is to extend the above mentioned works to the case when disorder and magnetic fields are present , maintaining the assumption of a gap in the energy spectrum at the fermi level .",
    "the main challenges arising in this more general setup are the breaking of the translational symmetry and the tedious linear response calculus with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "both challenges are overcome with the use of non - commutative geometric methods @xcite . the starting point for our work",
    "@xcite where non - commutative formulas for @xmath0 and @xmath2 have been reported .",
    "given these results , we could have proceeded along two routs , one relying on the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath1 and the other one relying on the variation of @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "we chose the first route because computing the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath1 fits better into the non - commutative geometry of the brillouin torus @xcite , which provides a set of explicit rules of calculus , including rules for how to compute the derivatives with respect to the magnetic field ( see sections  [ ncb ] and [ ito ] ) .",
    "these rules of calculus alone enabled us to complete the task at hand .",
    "for disordered time - reversal or inversion symmetric insulators ( @xmath9 ) , under the spectral gap assumption , we are able to formulate the following statement ( similar to the existing one for perfectly periodic crystals",
    "@xcite ) : the total change @xmath10 $ ] of @xmath8 , induced by an adiabatic deformation along a path @xmath11 in the model s parameter space , is equal to half of the second chern number over the manifold @xmath12 ( when the units are chosen such that @xmath13 ) . here , @xmath14 is either the time - reversal operation or the inversion operation and the path @xmath11 starts and ends with a time - reversal or inversion symmetric system . since @xmath10 $ ] can change only by an integer number if the path @xmath11 is re - routed , it follows that the integer or half - integer character of @xmath10 $ ] is independent of the deformation path and this extends the well - known @xmath5 topological classification to the disordered case .",
    "we would like to mention that the methods of non - commutative geometry enabled us to derive this result directly in the thermodynamic limit and to avoid the use of arguments based on twisted boundary conditions on large but finite volumes .",
    "the latter arguments are hard to control in the thermodynamic limit and they are problematic when strong disorder is considered .",
    "the explicit formula for @xmath8 ( eq .  [ mainformula ] ) and its topological properties discussed in the present work is a small step in a program that aims at elucidating what happens when strong disorder is present . by strong disorder we mean situations when the fermi level is embedded in a dense localized spectrum rather than being positioned in a spectral gap .",
    "the crucial question to answer is if the isotropic magneto - electric response remains quantized and invariant under the assumption of a mobility gap ( as opposed to a spectral gap ) at the fermi level .",
    "a rigorous answer to this question will finally resolve the problem of existence ( or lack ) of robust extended states in 3-dimensional topological insulators .",
    "the analysis reported in this work applies to generic disordered lattice - models in @xmath15-dimensions .",
    "the hilbert space for such a model is spanned by vectors of the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a node of the lattice and @xmath18 labels the orbitals associated with that node .",
    "the scalar product @xmath19 is by definition such that @xmath20 .",
    "the generic lattice - hamiltonians , in the absence of a magnetic field and disorder , take the form : @xmath21 accurate , material - specific lattice - models can be generated from _",
    "ab - initio _ computations using wannier function representations or simply by fitting the measured band structure @xcite . in almost all cases ,",
    "the lattice - hamiltonians involve only a finite number of hoppings between one unit cell and its neighbors , which is something we will assume in the followings .    in the presence of disorder and a uniform magnetic field @xmath1 , which will be parametrized as a @xmath22 antisymmetric tensor @xmath23 :",
    "@xmath24 the lattice - hamiltonian becomes : @xmath25 where the phase factor @xmath26 encodes the effect of the magnetic field through the peierls substitution @xcite .",
    "above , @xmath27 denotes the 3-dimensional euclidean scalar product and @xmath28 .",
    "the hopping amplitudes now have a random component , with a typical form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are independent random variables uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath31 $ ]",
    ". the collection of all random variables @xmath32 can be viewed as a point in an infinite dimensional configuration space @xmath33 , which can be equipped with a probability measure : @xmath34 furthermore , the discrete @xmath35 additive group has a natural action on @xmath33 given by : @xmath36 which acts ergodically on @xmath33 and leaves @xmath37 invariant . if @xmath38 denotes the magnetic translation by @xmath39 : @xmath40 then @xmath41 forms a covariant family of operators in the sense that : @xmath42    in the above settings , the quadruple @xmath43 determines a homogenous system @xcite , for which the intensive thermodynamic variables are , with probability one , independent of the disorder configurations .",
    "the results reported in this paper can be extended to more general models of homogeneous systems , but one should keep in mind the model of eq .",
    "[ latticehamo ] as a prototypical example .",
    "we end this section with a comment about discrete versus continuum models .",
    "definitely , working with lattice models reduces tremendously the technical complexity of the problem .",
    "one crucial difference is that the algebra of observables does have a unit in the discrete case , and it does nt in the continuum case .",
    "also , when working with discrete models , we are dealing only with bounded observable but this will not be the case for continuum models .",
    "hence , extending the theory to the continuum models will require more work at the technical level ( note also that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is starting point for our work , were established for discrete models ) .",
    "however , even if we do extend the theory to continuum models , an explicit computer calculation for a real material will not be possible , simply because of the sheer complexity of the problem .",
    "this is the main reason the community working on topological materials focuses almost entirely on lattice models .",
    "we should mention that , at least for the periodic case , the wannier function technique generates lattice models which exactly reproduce the bundle of the occupied states of the continuum models .",
    "if for perfectly periodic systems one is primarily concerned with the translationally invariant operators , for homogenous systems one is primarily concerned with the covariant families of operators .",
    "all relevant response functions and thermodynamic functions for a homogeneous model can be computed within the algebra generated by the covariant families of operators .",
    "this algebra can be given a @xmath44-algebra structure in the following way .",
    "for @xmath45 a covariant family of operators , all the information is encoded in the matrix elements : @xmath46 because all the other matrix elements can be obtained from @xmath47 using translations .",
    "hence , instead of working with covariant families of operators , one can work with functions : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the space of @xmath50 complex matrices , and with the algebraic operations that follows from the operator algebra when written for the matrix elements of eq .",
    "these operations are : @xmath51 for the beginning , one should consider only continuous functions @xmath52 with compact support .",
    "the algebra generated by such elements will be called @xmath53 .",
    "one can easily go back from the algebra @xmath53 to the algebra of bounded operators using the operator representation @xmath54 given by the formula : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 should be viewed here as column matrices with entries @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the result of a representation @xmath60 is automatically a covariant family of operators .",
    "for example , the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "[ latticehamo ] is generated by the element : @xmath61    if one introduces the norm on @xmath53 : @xmath62 and the @xmath63-operation : @xmath64 then the completion of @xmath53 under the norm of eq .",
    "[ norm ] becomes a @xmath44-algebra , which will be denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath44-algebra structure allows one to develop the spectral problem and the functional calculus in a purely algebraic framework , without any reference to wavefunctions .",
    "the algebra @xmath65 is the smallest algebra that one can consider and still be able to compute the response functions of the homogeneous systems .",
    "the classical differential manifolds are completely determined by the algebra of smooth functions defined over the manifold and by the differential calculus with these functions . in the non - commutative setting , one replaces the commutative algebra of smooth functions over the classic brillouin torus with the non - commutative algebra @xmath65 , and then builds a non - commutative differential calculus over @xmath65 . for the latter ,",
    "one replaces @xmath66-integration over the classical brillouin torus by a trace over @xmath65 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the trace over @xmath49 space , and the @xmath66-derivations by linear automorphisms of algebra @xmath65 : @xmath69 then the triplet @xmath70 determines a non - commutative manifold called the non - commutative brillouin torus .",

    "we automatically assume that the spectral gap at the fermi level remains open during the adiabatic interpolations .",
    "we will use the notations @xmath153 to denote the interpolation path obtained by joining the interpolation paths @xmath11 and @xmath154 , @xmath155 to denote the interpolation path @xmath11 when taken in reverse , and @xmath10 $ ] to indicate that the variation in the magneto - electric response depends on the interpolation path @xmath11 .",
    "the first question we want to address is what happens with the variation of the isotropic magneto - electric response when one considers different interpolation paths , @xmath156 and @xmath157 , between the reference and the final systems .",
    "since : @xmath158-\\delta \\alpha[\\gamma']=\\delta \\alpha[\\gamma-\\gamma'],\\ ] ] we can write : @xmath159 -\\delta \\alpha[\\gamma ' ]    = \\frac{1}{2}\\oint\\limits _ { \\gamma - \\gamma'}dt   \\",
    "\\varepsilon_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma \\delta}{\\cal t}\\big ( p*\\partial_\\alpha p*\\partial_\\beta p*\\partial_\\gamma p * \\partial_\\delta p \\big ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the important observation here is that the @xmath128-integral is now taken over a closed loop . one can then recognize on the right - hand side the expression of the second chern number @xmath160 over the manifold @xmath161 , written in the real - space rather than in the @xmath162-space . because of the finite - gap assumption , the second chern number is quantized , a fact that follows from a general argument by connes @xcite , which says that the pairing between the projectors and cyclic cocycles is a homotopy invariant .",
    "hence the quantization occurring in the clean limit persists when the disorder is turned on , at least as long as the spectral gap remains open .",
    "therefore , the answer to our first question is that the difference in @xmath10 $ ] , when computed along different adiabatic evolutions , is always an integer number ( we recall that our units were taken such that @xmath13 ) .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "1(a ) various possible situations . for example , if the interpolating paths @xmath156 and @xmath157 can be deformed into each other without closing the spectral gap , then @xmath160 is necessarily zero and @xmath10 $ ] is identical for the two interpolation paths .",
    "but , if the interpolating paths can not be deformed into each other without closing the spectral gap , such as it happens for @xmath156 and @xmath163 in fig .",
    "1(a ) , then @xmath160 may take non - trivial integer values so @xmath10 $ ] and @xmath164 $ ] can not be expected to be identical , but we can say with absolute confidence that the difference between the two will be an integer number .",
    "we now turn our attention to adiabatic interpolations between time - reversal invariant systems , in which case we need to turn the magnetic field off .",
    "symmetry considerations can be used to show that only the topological part of @xmath134 survives for such such systems @xcite .",
    "the time - reversal operation is given by the map : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is a matrix from @xmath167 representing the @xmath168-component of the spin operator , and the line at the top represents complex conjugation .",
    "some immediate properties of time - reversal map @xmath169 are : @xmath170 and @xmath171    now , let @xmath121 and @xmath115 be two time - reversal invariant hamiltonians , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "the key observation is that , if @xmath156 is an adiabatic interpolation between @xmath121 and @xmath115 , then @xmath174 is also an adiabatic interpolation between @xmath121 and @xmath115 ( with a strictly positive spectral gap ) , and furthermore : @xmath175 = \\delta \\alpha [ -\\theta \\gamma].\\ ] ] this can be seen from the explicit formula of eq .",
    "[ mainformula ] and the properties of the time - reversal map stated in eqs .",
    "[ v1 ] and [ v2 ] .",
    "we already established that : @xmath159-\\delta \\alpha[\\theta \\gamma ] = c_2[\\gamma-\\theta \\gamma],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this together with eq .",
    "[ v3 ] leads to an important conclusion for this section : @xmath176=\\frac{1}{2}c_2[\\gamma-\\theta \\gamma].\\ ] ] this is a generalization of the qi - hughes - zhang argument @xcite to the case of disordered insulators .    in fig .",
    "1(b ) we illustrate several possible situations .",
    "if @xmath11 can be deformed to a time - reversal invariant path , @xmath177 , then @xmath178 and @xmath10 $ ] is necessary zero .",
    "but if @xmath121 and @xmath115 can not be connected with a time - reversal invariant path without closing the spectral gap at the fermi level , then @xmath11 must be taken as in fig .",
    "1(b ) so that to avoid the closing of the spectral gap .",
    "in this case , @xmath179 $ ] can take non - trivial integer values and consequently @xmath10 $ ] can take non - trivial values , which are either integer or half - integer numbers . if we take a different interpolation path , such as @xmath154 in fig .",
    "1(b ) , then @xmath180 $ ] may change but only by an integer number , as it was already established above .",
    "as such , for all possible adiabatic interpolation paths , @xmath10 $ ] is either an integer number or a half - integer number . in other words , the integer or half - integer character of @xmath10 $ ] is topologically stable .",
    "the results of the last section can be further developed into a @xmath5 classification of the 3-dimensional disordered time - reversal invariant insulators . for this",
    ", one can take the reference systems to be the insulators with zero hopping amplitudes between different lattice sites .",
    "these systems can be called  trivial \" since they do not display any magneto - electric response as there are no peierls factors when a magnetic field is turned on . as such",
    ", we can postulate @xmath181 for the trivial systems .",
    "then , the time - reversal invariant insulators fall into two classes ( here we assume that all time - reversal symmetric insulators can be adiabatically connected to a representative from the trivial class ) : one for which @xmath182 and one for which @xmath183 , and we can say with absolute confidence that an insulator from the first class and an insulator from the second class can not be connected by a time - reversal invariant interpolation path without closing the insulating gap . an insulator from a given symmetry class is generally called topological @xcite if it can not be adiabatically connected with its atomic limit ( obtained by turning off the hopping terms between distinct lattice sites ) via an interpolation path that respects the symmetry of the class and without closing the insulating gap . if we follow this definition , then the class of 3-dimensional disordered time - reversal invariant insulators with @xmath184 contains only topological insulators .",
    "of course , our analysis does not rule out additional , more refined topological sub - classifications of either @xmath185 or @xmath184 classes .",
    "a @xmath5 classification of the disordered inversion symmetric insulators is also possible via similar arguments .",
    "this is the case because the inversion operation satisfies the properties written in eqs .",
    "[ v1 ] and [ v2 ] , which are at the core of the @xmath5 classification of time - reversal insulators .",
    "however , for inversion symmetric insulators , it is explicitly known @xcite that the @xmath5 classification is not the end of the story as it can be furtherly refined .",
    "we would like to point out that the computation of section  [ me ] remains valid even in the regime of strong disorder where the insulating gap is closed and is replaced by a mobility gap ( provided we accept the formula eq .",
    "[ electricpolarization ] for the electric polarization ) .",
    "if a non - commutative theory of the second chern number paralleling that of the first chern number @xcite can be developed , then the magneto - electric response can be used to topologically classify the time - reversal and inversion symmetric insulators in the strong disorder regime , which is one of the long - standing open problems in the field .    the non - commutative formula eq .",
    "[ mainformula ] of the magneto - electric response can be efficiently evaluated on a computer by using the methods developed in ref .",
