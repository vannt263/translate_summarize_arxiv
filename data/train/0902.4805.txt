    "in writing this article , i have two main objectives .",
    "the first is to chart the evolution of the analytic approach to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) perturbation theory , focusing on the key turning points in its theoretical development .",
    "the second is to demonstrate how this approach works in terms of selected applications . of course",
    ", i am forced to leave out many interesting applications and aspects of the approach , which in turn means that my presentation will not be complete .",
    "i would refer the reader to the original references for further reading and in order to study the subject in more technical detail .",
    "the sorts of ideas and issues to be discussed in this presentation include the following benchmarks :    * `` ultraviolet ( uv ) freedom '' , `` infrared ( ir ) slavery '' , and landau singularity . * renormalizability , analyticity ( in @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , causality , and summability . * first remedies in the infrared : color saturation , effective gluon mass . * screening of the landau singularities via sudakov form factors .",
    "* shirkov - solovtsov analytic coupling  euclidean and minkowski space . * from a recipe to a paradigm : analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) . * more scales , more riddles : logarithms of the factorization ( evolution ) scale  naive and maximal analytization . * generalization of the analyticity requirement : from the coupling to the whole hadronic amplitude and its spectral density . * creation of fractional apt ( fapt ) in the spacelike and timelike regions .",
    "* summation of perturbation series , sudakov gluon resummation ( exponentiation vs. analytization ) , power corrections .",
    "two key properties define qcd as the unbroken @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 denoting the number of colors ) yang - mills theory describing strong interactions at the microscopic level : asymptotic freedom and confinement . while the first property has been confirmed and was granted a nobel prize in physics in the year 2004 , the other is still a matter of fact , with the underlying microscopic mechanism still at large .",
    "one claims that the reason for the non - observation of free quarks and gluons in nature is due to their color content . from this , one concludes that only color singlets are observable  hence , defacto color confinement .",
    "the main ingredient in justifying the uv freedom of qcd is that the renormalized qcd coupling becomes small at large momenta : @xmath6 as @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that though initially the coupling and the momentum scale are independent parameters they get linked to each other on account of the renormalizability of qcd .",
    "hence , in the large - momentum region ( or , equivalently , at short distances ) , qcd can be applied perturbatively , in analogy to qed in the sense of a weak - coupling expansion . a conventional way to define the running strong coupling in the @xmath8 scheme is given by @xmath9 @xmath10 }             { \\ln \\left(\\mu^{2}/\\lambda^{2}\\right ) }    \\right ]    + \\mathcal{o}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\ln ^{3}\\left(\\mu^{2}/\\lambda^{2}\\right ) }                 \\right ] \\ ,",
    "\\label{eq : alpha - s}\\ ] ] which expresses it by means of the dimensional parameter @xmath11 , whereas @xmath12 represents the number of active flavors . for our considerations",
    "to follow it is more convenient to use the abbreviation @xmath13 and recast the above expression in terms of the first two coefficients of the @xmath14 function @xmath15 namely , @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . then , eq .",

    "the next coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 have also been analytically computed and confirmed by independent calculations at the level of 3 and 4 loops ( see second paper in @xcite for references ) . ]",
    "@xmath25 exhibiting the asymptotic - freedom property , i.e. , @xmath26 as @xmath27 .",
    "the scale parameter @xmath28 is not a generic parameter of the qcd lagrangian ; its definition is arbitrary .",
    "however , once defined , it becomes the fundamental constant of qcd to be determined by experiment .    on the other hand , at @xmath29 the running strong coupling",
    "has a landau singularity that spoils analyticity . at the one - loop level",
    "this singularity is a simple pole , whereas at higher loops the corresponding landau singularity has a more complicated structure ( e.g. , a square - root singularity at two loops , et cetera ) . to restore analyticity in the infrared region @xmath30 and ensure causality in the whole @xmath2 plane",
    ", one has to remove the landau singularity at any loop order of the perturbative expansion .",
    "this may become a serious problem , both theoretically and phenomenologically , for several hadronic processes  in particular for exclusive processes like hadron form factors .",
    "for example , in the case of the spacelike pion s electromagnetic form factor  a typical exclusive process ",
    "most experimental data are available in a momentum region , where repercussions of the landau singularity can influence ( actually contaminate ) the perturbative calculation , as first shown and detailed in @xcite and later further analyzed in @xcite .",
    "another way to describe this behavior is to use the language of information theory and consider a perturbatively calculable quantity , like the scaled pion factor vs. the momentum transfer @xmath2 , as being a _ dynamic range _ of quality of the perturbative expansion . in this context",
    ", the accuracy of the qcd perturbative result ( _ the signal _ ) depends on the magnitude of the running coupling .",
    "the larger @xmath2 , the smaller the coupling and , hence , the higher the precision of the ( perturbative ) calculation is .",
    "as one approaches the landau singularity , the coupling increases rendering the perturbative expansion less and less precise , i.e. , creating a kind of _ noise_. when one reaches the landau singularity , the `` noise '' ( the uncertainty ) becomes overwhelming and one is unable to extract any information ( a clear `` signal '' ) from perturbation theory .",
    "the next few sections will show in more detail how this problem can be averted .    of course , one may interpret the breakdown of perturbation theory at low momenta @xmath31 , as a `` natural '' consequence of the ( unknown ) confinement forces that prevail in this momentum region .",
    "the problem is that this breakdown is not universal but depends on the renormalization scheme adopted and the renormalization scale - fixing procedure used . for instance , adopting the brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) commensurate - scale procedure , when including higher - order qcd perturbative corrections ( see @xcite for further details ) , the blm scale may become very low ( compared to the original momentum scale ) and deeply intruding into the `` forbidden '' nonperturbative region , where the running coupling blows up and perturbative qcd becomes invalid .",
    "an example : using the blm procedure in the calculation of the pion s electromagnetic form factor at nlo @xcite , the qcd running coupling may still `` feel '' the landau singularity at momenta as large as @xmath32  gev@xmath33 , a region close to the largest momenta probed by experiment at present for this reaction .",
    "hence , the ( scheme - dependent ) optimization of the qcd perturbative expansion of typical hadronic quantities may depend in a crucial way on the ir behavior of the running coupling .",
    "it becomes clear that any attempt to apply an optimized renormalization prescription ( scheme ) in high fixed - order perturbative calculations should make sure that the result is not distorted by artificial logarithmic enhancements originating from the landau singularity .",
    "clearing away this obstruction is a real challenge .",
    "the simplest way to avoid the landau singularity in euclidean space is to use a rigid ir cutoff on its value , say , @xmath34 , such as to render the perturbative expansion sound .",
    "a more sophisticated procedure is to assume that below some momentum scale @xmath35 color forces saturate , so that quarks and gluons are confined within color - singlet states .",
    "the ir cutoff scale @xmath36 can be conceived of as an effective gluon mass @xmath37 generated by the dynamics of confinement , as proposed by cornwall ( 1982 ) ( for references and applications , see @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism tames the landau singularity , but the intrinsic scale @xmath37 is an extraneous parameter to the approach and has to be determined by other methods , e.g. , on the lattice .",
    "indeed , the saturated coupling at one loop reads @xmath38 } \\label{eq : sat - alpha}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 and is ir finite . here",
    "@xmath37 is a dynamical gluon mass with numerical values in the range @xmath40  mev .",
    "this scale my be thought of as being the average transverse momentum of vacuum partons within the framework of nonlocal quark and gluon condensates .",
    "technically , the role of the ir regulator @xmath37 is to `` freeze '' @xmath41 at low momenta @xmath42 , so that the coupling ceases to increase and flattens out .    an alternative approach to protect perturbatively calculated observables",
    "was developed by sterman and collaborators ( references and applications in @xcite ) , in which @xmath43 singularities were screened by sudakov - type damping exponentials @xmath44 that encapsulate the effects of gluonic radiative corrections .",
    "these are resumed contributions stemming from two - particle reducible diagrams ( giving rise to leading double logarithms ) , while two - particle irreducible diagrams ( entailing subleading single logarithms ) are absorbed into the hard - scattering part of the process .",
    "because @xmath44 drops to zero faster than any power of @xmath45 , this provides sufficient ir protection against landau singularities both for mesonic amplitudes as well as for baryonic ones ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "indeed , in the axial gauge , all sudakov contributions due to unintegrated transverse momenta of the gluon propagators exponentiate into suppressing sudakov factors that suffice to render the landau singularity of the one - loop running coupling in the form factors of the pion and the nucleon harmless , though the latter case is theoretically much more involved ",
    "see @xcite . the main advantage of this approach relative to the previous one",
    "is that it contains an intrinsic ir regulator in terms of the impact parameter characterizing the inter - quark separations in the hadrons .",
    "hence , there is no need here for external ir regulators ( like @xmath37 ) because ir protection is provided _ in situ _ by the sudakov effect , the underlying idea being that gluons with wavelengths larger than the impact parameter `` see '' the quark configuration as a whole , i.e. , in a color - singlet state and hence decouple .",
    "it is worth noting that the sudakov suppression can be simulated by a saturated running coupling of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sat - alpha ] ) , if we assume that the ir cutoff parameter ( i.e. , the effective gluon mass ) has to be adjusted to each individual value of the varying external momentum  for a mathematical version of this idea see @xcite .",
    "let us close this discussion by remarking that the application of this type of approach to the timelike region using analytic continuation is not straightforward owing to the fact that not only the running coupling has to be analytically continued but also the whole sudakov form factor .",
    "a bridge here to what is to come in the next section with regard to analytization . in separate parallel developments",
    "( see @xcite for references ) , krasnikov and pivovarov ( 1982 ) , and independently radyushkin ( 1982 ) , have obtained analytic expressions for the one - loop running coupling ( and its powers ) directly in minkowski space using an integral transformation from the spacelike to the timelike region reverse to that for the adler @xmath46-function . in both approaches a resummed @xmath28-parametrization for @xmath47 in the spacelike region was employed in order to construct in the timelike region an expansion for @xmath48 in which all @xmath49-terms ( @xmath50 ) are summed explicitly .",
    "this way , an analytic coupling in the timelike region was derived .",
    "this sort of analytic coupling in minkowski space was rediscovered in the context of the resummation of fermion bubbles by ball , beneke , and braun ( 1995 ) , partly in connection with techniques and applications to the @xmath51 hadronic width ( references are given in @xcite ) .",
    "still other approaches to avoid ghost singularities in the running coupling are referenced in @xcite .",
    "shirkov and solovtsov ( 1996 ) @xcite have invented an analytic coupling based solely on renormalization - group ( rg ) invariance and causality ( spectrality ) in terms of a dispersion relation , generalizing the earlier work by bogoliubov , logunov , and shirkov for qed ( the reference can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the key ingredient of their framework is the spectral density @xmath52 with the aid of which an analytic running coupling can be defined in the euclidean region ( @xmath53 ) using a klln - lehmann spectral representation : @xmath54_\\text{an }     = \\int_0^{\\infty}\\ !",

    "one obtains in the euclidean region @xcite @xmath56 while its counterpart in minkowski space reads @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 both couplings are analytic functions of their arguments .",
    "the analyticity of @xmath60 is ensured by the second power - behaved term in ( [ eq : a_1 ] ) which removes the landau ( ghost ) pole , whereas @xmath61 does not contain any singular term at all .",
    "this analytization concept was used earlier in qed by redmond ( 1958 ) ( see @xcite for the reference ) in connection with the elimination of ghosts in propagators , based on a term - by - term perturbation expansion in the coupling constant .",
    "the graphical representation of the removal of the landau ghost in the coupling is shown in fig .",

    "the simple analytization concept for the one - loop running coupling in the spacelike region has been extended by its inventors and their collaborators to higher loops and has been applied to several characteristic hadronic processes .",
    "examples are the inclusive decay of a @xmath51-lepton into hadrons , the momentum - scale and scheme dependence of the bjorken and the gross - llewellyn smith sum rule , @xmath62 decays into hadrons , et cetera ( the corresponding references can be found in @xcite ) . in fig .",

    "meanwhile , a systematic approach  a new paradigm for perturbative calculations in qcd has emerged , termed analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) . in a nutshell ,",
    "it can be summarized as follows .",

    "apt , hadronic quantities defined ( in the minkowski region ) by @xmath80 with @xmath81 have no landau singularities in the euclidean region , because the spacelike couplings @xmath82 are analytic functions .",
    "one appreciates that apt transforms a power - series expansion into a non - power - series , i.e. , a functional expansion .",
    "let us close this section by making some important remarks ( for references , see @xcite ) :    * analytization in euclidean space means subtraction of the landau pole ( at one loop ) .",
    "* analytization in minkowski space amounts to summation of @xmath83 terms .",
    "* observables become non - power - series expansions ( i.e. , n is an index not a power ) : @xmath84 ( euclidean space ) , @xmath85 ( minkowski space ) . *",
    "the elimination of ghost singularities in apt appears as a result of causality ( spectrality ) and rg invariance , i.e. , the pole remover is not introduced by hand . * two - loop expressions for the analytic couplings are possible by means of the lambert function ( magradze ( 2000 ) ) . * still",
    "higher orders can be obtained with an approximate spectral density and employing numerical integration ( shirkov ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "* incorporation of heavy - quark flavors possible ( `` global apt''shirkov ( 2001 ) ) .",
    "* modifications of apt in the deep ir are possible via a spectral density which contains ( nonperturbative ) power corrections ( alekseev ( 2006 ) ; nesterenko and papavassiliou ( 2005 ) ; cveti and valenzuela ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "the above exposition suffices to demonstrate the usefulness of apt .",
    "but where are its limitations ? can the new paradigm be applied to more complicated cases that contain more than one large momentum scale ? and can apt accommodate the crucial effect of evolution ? as we can not sidestep these problems , we will have to dig deeper into analytization .",
    "this is not a terminal difficulty of the analytic approach  and we can even benefit from it because doing so , we will ultimately expand apt to noninteger powers of the coupling .",
    "it is to these questions to which we focus now our attention .    to start with , we consider as a `` theoretical laboratory '' the factorized part of the spacelike pion s electromagnetic form factor . in nlo perturbation theory ,",
    "this quantity can be written as a convolution @xmath86 $ ] of a hard - scattering amplitude @xmath87 and two pion distribution amplitudes , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , representing the incoming and outgoing pion bound states of quarks with longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "@xmath87 is the amplitude for a collinear valence quark - antiquark pair , struck by a highly virtual photon with the large momentum @xmath2 , and contains hard - gluon exchanges characterized by the strong coupling @xmath92 to the considered order of expansion .",
    "then , we have @xmath93 where @xmath94 \\label{eq : phi024mu0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the leading twist-2 pion distribution amplitude containing the nonperturbative information on the pion quark structure in terms of the gegenbauer coefficients @xmath95 at the initial scale @xmath96  gev@xmath97 , and @xmath87 is the sum of all quark - gluon subprocesses up to the order @xmath98 ( its explicit form can be found in the second paper in @xcite and also in @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xmath87 depends explicitly on @xmath43 , whereas @xmath99 has a more complicated dependence controlled by the evolution equation .",
    "besides , beyond the lo of perturbation theory , @xmath87 depends not only on the large external momentum @xmath2 , but also on a second auxiliary momentum scale @xmath100 which separates the hard ( perturbative ) from the soft ( nonperturbative ) dynamics on account of a factorization theorem .",
    "invariably , the soft parts , i.e. , the pion distribution amplitudes , have to be evolved with appropriate anomalous dimensions from the initial scale @xmath101 to the actual scale of observation @xmath2 .",
    "as we will discuss in the next section , this additional scale has influence on the analytization procedure that can not be covered by apt .      some technical comments : ( a ) the pole remover in the one - loop running coupling does not change the leading double logarithmic behavior of the sudakov factor , though the cusp anomalous dimension in the sudakov exponent receives additional subleading contributions .",
    "( b ) due to the absence of ghost singularities , the sudakov exponents are analytic functions of @xmath2 .",
    "( c ) the perturbatively calculable part of the pion s electromagnetic form factor @xmath111 receives the bulk of its contributions from small transverse distances @xmath112 below @xmath113 , i.e. , it saturates in exactly that region , where the application of qcd perturbation theory is valid @xcite .",
    "however , the full treatment of the sudakov - type gluon resummation in impact space faces special subtleties which have not been fully resolved until now .",
    "first results within a toy model in momentum space ( see appendix c of @xcite ) seem to indicate a conflict between analytization and exponentiation of soft gluons .",
    "phenomenologically , already the `` naive '' analytization procedure and even more the `` maximal '' application of apt have important consequences : ( i ) the artificial increase of the spacelike electromagnetic pion form factor towards low @xmath2 values  caused by the landau singularity  is absent , ( ii ) the sensitivity of the results on the choice of the renormalization scheme and the scale setting adopted is extremely reduced relative to the standard power - series expansion of perturbative qcd [ shirkov and solovtsov ( 1998 ) and @xcite ] .",
    "this behavior is shown graphically in fig .",

    "all these issues are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the main observation from this figure is that applying apt in its maximal form to a typical exclusive quantity , like @xmath102 , not only provides ir stability , it also diminishes its renormalization scheme and scale - setting dependence already at the nlo level .",
    "indeed , the predictions obtained in different schemes do not differ significantly from each other in a wide range of momenta from low to large @xmath2 values .    to further appreciate the advantages of the analytic scheme relative to the standard power - series expansion , bear in mind our statements in sec .",
