    "unstable particles ( up s ) are described usually by dressed propagator or with the help of the @xmath0-matrix with complex pole .",
    "the problems of these descriptions have been under considerable discussion for many decades [ ]  [ ] ( and references therein ) .",
    "there are also other approaches such as time - asymmetric qft of up s [ ] , effective theory [ ] , modified perturbative theory approach [ ] , and phenomenological qf model of up s with smeared mass [ ] . in this work",
    "we consider some remarkable properties of the model [ ] which are caused by mass smearing and lead to the factorization effects in the description of the processes with up in an intermediate state .",
    "the model under consideration is based on the time - energy uncertainty relation ( ur ) . despite their formal uniformity ,",
    "various ur s have different physical nature .",
    "this point has been discussed for many years beginning with heisenberg s formulating the uncertainty principle ( for instance , see [ ]  [ ] and references therein ) . the first model of up based on the time - energy ur was suggested in [ ] .",
    "time - dependent wave function of up in its rest frame was written in terms of the fourier transform which may be interpreted as a distribution of mass values , with a spread , @xmath1 , related to the mean lifetime @xmath2 by uncertainty relation [ ] : @xmath3 thus , from the time - energy ur for the unstable quantum system , we are led to the concept of mass smearing for up , which is described by ur ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "implicitly ( indirectly ) the time - energy ur , or instability , is usually taken into account by using the complex pole in @xmath0-matrix or dressed propagator which describes up in an intermediate state .",
    "explicit account of the relation ( [ 1.1 ] ) is taken by describing up in a final or initial states with the help of the mass - smearing effect . from eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) it follows that this effect is noticeable if up has a large width .",
    "mass smearing was considered in the various fields of particle physics  in the decay processes of up with large width [ ] , in the boson - pair production [ ] , and in the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations [ ] . in these papers ,",
    "the efficiency of the mass - smearing conception was demonstrated in a wide class of processes .",
    "the effects of exact factorization in the two - particle scattering and three - particle decay were shown for the cases of scalar , vector , and spinor up in refs .  [ ] .",
    "factorized formulae for cross section and decay width were derived exactly ( without any approximations ) for the tree - level processes in the physical gauge .",
    "however , the results can be generalized taking account of principal part of radiative corrections [ ] ( see section 3 ) .",
    "the factorization method that is based on the exact factorization in the simplest processes was suggested in [ ] . in this work",
    "we generalize the results of [ ] to the case of up with spin @xmath4 and apply them to some complicated processes . in the second section",
    "we describe the main elements of the model that lead to the effects of factorization .",
    "these effects in the case of the simplest processes are considered in section 3 for up with @xmath5 . the factorization method based on the results of the third section",
    "is applied to some more complicated processes in section 4 . in this section ,",
    "we also consider the accuracy of the calculations .",
    "some conclusions are made concerning the applicability and advantages of the method in the fifth section .",
    "in this section we present the elements of the model [ ] that are used directly in the factorization method .",
    "the field function of the up is a continuous superposition of the standard ones defined at a fixed mass with a weight function of the mass parameter @xmath6 which describes mass smearing . as a result of this ,",
    "an amplitude of the process with up in a final or initial state has the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is an amplitude defined in a standard way at fixed mass parameter @xmath9 , and @xmath6 is a model weight function .",
    "the model green s function has a convolution form with respect to the mass parameter @xmath9 ( the lehmann representation ) . in the case of scalar up",
    "it is as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is defined in a standard way for a fixed @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a probability density of the mass parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the model propagators of scalar , vector , and spinor unstable fields in momentum representation are given by the following expressions [ ] : @xmath14 the model propagators are completely defined if the function @xmath13 is determined .    here , we generalize the results of the works [ ] to include the case of unstable fields with spin @xmath4 .",
    "the propagator of this field is defined in [ ] and smearing its mass , @xmath15 , gives : @xmath16    determination of the weight function @xmath6 or corresponding probability density @xmath17 can be done with the help of the various methods [ ] . here we consider the definition of @xmath13 which leads to the effect of exact factorization .",
    "we match the model propagator of scalar up to the standard dressed one : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a conventional polarization function .",
    "it was shown in [ ] that the correspondence ( [ 2.5 ] ) leads to the definition : @xmath20 ^ 2+[im\\pi(\\mu)]^2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath21 .",
    "substitution of the expression ( [ 2.6 ] ) into ( [ 2.3 ] ) and integration over @xmath9 lead to the results : @xmath22 and @xmath23 in analogy with these definitions we get the expression for the propagator of vector - spinor unstable field : @xmath24 note that in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.8 ] ) and ( [ 2.9 ] ) we have substituted @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the expressions ( [ 2.5])([2.9 ] ) define an effective theory of up s which follows from the model and the definition ( [ 2.6 ] ) , that is from the correspondence ( [ 2.5 ] ) . in this theory",
    "the numerators of the expressions ( [ 2.7])([2.9 ] ) differ from the standard ones . the correspondence between standard and model expressions for the cases of vector ( in unitary gauge ) and spinor up is given by the interchange @xmath27 in the numerators of the standard and model propagators ( here @xmath28 .",
    "as a result the structures of the model propagators lead to the effect of exact factorization , while the standard ones lead to approximate factorization ( see the next section ) .",
    "exact factorization is stipulated by the following properties of the model : + a ) smearing the mass shell of up in accordance with the time - energy ur ; + b ) specific structure of the numerators of the propagators , eqs .",
    "( [ 2.7])([2.9 ] ) .",
    "+ the first factor allows us to describe up in an intermediate state with the momentum @xmath29 as a particle in a final or initial states with the variable mass @xmath30 . in this case , up is described by the following polarization matrices which differ from the standard on - shell ones by the change @xmath31 ( see also [ ] ) : @xmath32,\\notag\\\\      & \\mbox{(vector - spinor up)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second factor is the coincidence of the expressions for the propagator numerators ( [ 2.7])([2.9 ] ) and for the polarization matrices ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "it allows us to represent the amplitude of the process with up in an intermediate state ( see fig.1 ) in a partially factorized form : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a spiral amplitude . the representation ( [ 3.2 ] ) is a precondition of factorization , while full exact factorization occurs in the transition probability .",
    "the effect of factorization is illustrated in fig.1 where up in an intermediate state is signed by crossed line .",
    "now , we demonstrate the factorization effect in the case of the simplest basic elements of the tree processes , where up is in the @xmath35 channel intermediate state .",
    "the vertices are described by the simplest standard lagrangians for scalar , vector , and spinor particles ( see refs .",
    "[ ] ) . here",
    "we add the lagrangian that describes the interaction of vector - spinor particles with lower - spin ones [ ]  [ ] : @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 , @xmath39 are off - shell parameters , and @xmath40 is the parameter of the lagrangian of the rarita - schwinger free field .",
    "let us consider the simplest processes which are used further as the basic elements of the method .",
    "note that calculations are made at the `` tree level '' in the framework of the effective theory , which follows from the model with mass smearing and contains self - energy corrections in the function @xmath13 .",
    "this effective theory is not a gauge one , but the definitions of the model propagators ( [ 2.3 ] ) are given in analogy with the standard physical gauge ( unitary gauge for massive fields ) .",
    "the first element is two - particle scattering with up of any type in the intermediate state .",
    "by straightforward calculation at the tree level it was shown that the cross - section for all permissible combinations of particles @xmath41 can be represented in the universal factorized form [ ] : @xmath42 here , @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the denominator of the propagator of an unstable particle @xmath45 which is defined by eqs .",
    "( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) , @xmath46 is normalized klln function and @xmath47 is a partial width of the particle @xmath45 with variable mass @xmath48 .",
    "note that exact factorization in the process under consideration always takes place for scalar @xmath49 in both the standard and model treatment . in the case of vector and spinor",
    "@xmath49 the factorization is exact in the framework of the model only . in the standard treatment",
    "the expression ( [ 3.5 ] ) is valid in the narrow - width approximation ( see , for instance , eq .  ( 37.51 ) and corresponding comment in [ ] ) .",
    "if the diagram depicted in fig.2 is included into a more complicated one as a sub - diagram , where the particle @xmath50 and/or @xmath51 are unstable , then we have to generalize partial width , for instance , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is unstable particle @xmath51 with mass @xmath30 ( see the next section ) .",
    "note that eq.([3.5 ] ) differs from the corresponding equation ( 6 ) in [ ] and equation ( 42 ) in [ ] which contain misprints .",
    "correct expressions can be got in [ ] by modification @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is spin of the particle @xmath57 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that eq.([3.5 ] ) is valid for the cases of scalar ( @xmath58 ) , vector ( @xmath59 ) , and spinor ( @xmath60 ) unstable particles . in this work we check by direct calculation that eq.([3.5 ] ) is also correct in the case of up with @xmath4 , when eq .",
    "( [ 2.9 ] ) is used ( for instance , @xmath61-resonance production ) .",
    "we should note that the expressions which involve vector - spinor up are valid for the particles on the mass shell in the framework of the standard treatment .",
    "however , in the framework of the model , up is always on its smeared mass shell and these expressions are valid in general case .",
    "moreover , the part of expressions which contains off - shell parameters as well as @xmath40-parameter disappears in widths and cross - sections .",
    "hence the condition of factorization  the coincidence of the polarization matrix and the numerators of the propagators  is fulfilled in the case under consideration ( see eqs . ( [ 2.9 ] ) and ( [ 3.1 ] ) ) .",
    "the second basic element is a three - particle decay with up in the intermediate state @xmath62 ( fig.[fig : born3 ] ) , where @xmath49 is up of any kind .    by straightforward calculations",
    "it was shown that the three - particle partial width at the tree level can be represented in the universal factorized form [ ] : @xmath63 where @xmath49 is a scalar , vector or spinor up , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . by direct calculations",
    "we also check the validity of the expression ( [ 3.6 ] ) for the case of the up with @xmath4 ( see the remark to eq.([3.5 ] ) ) .",
    "it is seen clearly that the formula ( [ 3.6 ] ) can include any factorizable corrections .    by summing over decay channels of @xmath49 , from eq.([3.6 ] ) we get the well - known convolution formula for the decays with up in a final state [ ] : @xmath66 in eq.([3.7 ] ) smearing the mass of unstable state @xmath49 is described by the probability density @xmath67 : @xmath68 the expression ( [ 3.8 ] ) is connected with eq.([2.6 ] ) by the relation @xmath69",
    ".    the factorized expressions ( [ 3.6 ] ) and ( [ 3.7 ] ) are applied successfully for the description of the decay @xmath70 [ ] , decay properties of @xmath71-meson [ ] and @xmath72-quark [ ] , lightest chargino and next - to - lightest neutralino [ ] . moreover",
    ", the formula ( [ 3.6 ] ) describes the decays @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 with great accuracy ( see the next section ) .",
    "it should be noted that , in analogy with two - particle scattering , the factorization in the expression for the width ( [ 3.6 ] ) is also exact within the framework of the model and approximate in the standard treatment ( convolution method ) .",
    "besides , we note that the expressions ( [ 3.5 ] ) and ( [ 3.6 ] ) significantly simplify calculations in comparison with the standard ones .",
    "the method is based on exact factorization of the simplest processes with up in an intermediate state that were considered in section 3 .",
    "the factorization method has applicability to such feynman diagrams that can be disconnected into two components by cutting some line corresponding to timelike momentum transfer .",
    "for instance , it is applicable to the complicated scattering and decay - chain processes which can be reduced to a chain of the basic elements ( [ 3.5 ] ) and ( [ 3.6 ] ) . next , we consider some examples of such processes .",
    "@xmath76    the cross - section of this process is a combination of the expressions ( [ 3.5 ] ) and ( [ 3.6 ] ) : @xmath77 where @xmath55 .",
    "it should be noted that the factorization effectively reduces the number of independent kinematic variables which have to be integrated . in the standard approach for the process",
    "@xmath78 the number of the variables , which uniquely specify a point in the phase space , in the general case is @xmath79 , from which four variables have to be integrated [ ] . some of this variables can be integrated out if a specific symmetry of the process occur . in the framework of",
    "the approach suggested the number of integrated variables is always @xmath80 .",
    "the same effect of variable reduction takes place for the case of the basic processes of scattering and decay which were considered in the previous section .    the expression ( [ 4.2 ] ) can be used for fast evaluation of cross sections of some scattering processes both in cosmology and collider physics .",
    "for instance , it is valid for the description of the annihilation process with the lightest supersymmetric particle in a final state [ ] .",
    "@xmath81    the width of this decay - chain process is given by doubling the formula ( [ 3.6 ] ) : @xmath82 note that in the general case of @xmath83-particle decay the number of kinematic variables , which uniquely specify a point in the phase space , is @xmath84 [ ] , while the method gives @xmath85 ( see comment to the previous case ) .",
    "thus , we have a significant simplification of calculations .",
    "some examples of processes which can be described by the compact formula ( [ 4.4 ] ) are considered in [ ] , where the relation between convolution method and decay - chain method is analyzed .",
    "@xmath86    the cross - section of this @xmath72-channel process is described by convolution of the cross - section @xmath87 and the width @xmath88 : @xmath89 this formula can be applied to the description of the processes @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the diagram in fig.6 illustrates a class of processes at the tree level with fermion - antifermion pair in the one - pole approximation , i.e. generated from the decay of @xmath49 only .",
    "however , the formula ( [ 4.6 ] ) can be easily generalized taking account of factorizable radiative corrections .",
    "for instance , such a generalization of the expression ( [ 4.6 ] ) was made in [ ] for the description of the process @xmath92",
    ", @xmath93 , with @xmath94-pairs being produced by @xmath95-decay only ( `` single - pole '' resonant production ) .",
    "note that additional non - resonant `` ladder '' diagrams also contribute to the process @xmath96 .",
    "the resonant events can be still separated in certain kinematic regions [ ] . in our calculations",
    "[ ] ( with the kinematic cut corresponding to the event selection of ref . [ ] ) we have taken into account isr and principal part of radiative corrections .",
    "these corrections do not change the structure of the expression ( [ 4.6 ] ) and satisfy the condition of factorization .",
    "the results are in good agreement with the experimental data and sm predictions at @xmath97 [ ] .",
    "we should note , however , that our calculations are valid in the energy domain , where the selection of the resonant events is possible .",
    "@xmath98    now , we consider the process of @xmath95-pair production ( or four - fermion production in the double - pole approximation ) .",
    "direct application of the model to the process @xmath99 or using the factorization method for the full process @xmath100 ( double - pole approach ) gives the following expression for cross - section at the tree level [ ] : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is defined in a standard way for the case of fixed boson masses @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and probability density of mass @xmath105 is defined by the expression : @xmath106 similar expressions can be written for the processes @xmath107 [ ] and @xmath108 [ ] . to describe exclusive processes , such as @xmath109 , one has to substitute partial @xmath29-dependent width @xmath110 into the expression ( [ 4.7 ] ) instead of the total width @xmath111 .",
    "note that the expression similar to ( [ 4.6 ] ) can be written in the standard approach as a result of integration over the phase space variables which describe @xmath112-states in the semi - analytical approximation ( saa ) [ ] . within the framework of the model considered , formula ( [ 4.6 ] )",
    "is derived exactly without any approximations .",
    "note also that as a rule the deviation of the standard exact results from the model ones is negligible ( see eq .",
    "( [ 4.12 ] ) ) .",
    "the processes @xmath113 were considered in detail [ ] taking account of the relevant radiative corrections .",
    "it was shown that the results of the model calculations are in good agreement with the experimental lep ii data and coincide with standard monte - carlo results with great accuracy . at the same time",
    "the factorization method significantly simplifies the calculation procedures in comparison with the standard ones that should consider about ten thousands diagrams ( see , for example , [ ] and comments in [ ] ) .",
    "using the factorization method one can describe complicated decay - chain and scattering processes in a simple way .",
    "the same results can occur within the frame of standard treatment as the approximations .",
    "such approximations are known as narrow - width approximation ( nwa ) [ ] , convolution method ( cm ) [ ]  [ ] , decay - chain method ( dcm ) [ ] and semi - analytical approach ( saa ) [ ] .",
    "all these approximations get a strict analytical formulation within the framework of the factorization method .",
    "for instance , nwa includes five assumptions which was considered in detail in [ ] .",
    "the factorization method contains just one assumption ",
    "non - factorizable corrections are small ( the fifth assumption of nwa ) .",
    "the method suggested can be applied to very complicated decay - chain and scattering processes by combining the expressions considered above . in this case",
    "we have not a strict and general standard analog of such approximation .",
    "now , we consider some ways of evaluation of the method error which we define as the deviation of the model results from the strict standard ones . for a scalar up",
    "the error always equals zero in accordance with the definition ( [ 2.5 ] ) . for a vector up",
    "the error is caused by the following difference : @xmath114 where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are standard and model numerators of vector propagators in the physical gauge . in the case of meson - pair production @xmath117",
    "the deviation equals zero too , due to vanishing contribution of the transverse parts of the amplitudes in both cases : @xmath118 in the case of the high - energy collisions @xmath119 ( we neglect @xmath120 interference ) the transverse part of the amplitude is : @xmath121 and we get at @xmath122 : @xmath123 thus , an error of the factorization method at the vicinity of resonance is always small , moreover , it is suppressed by small factor @xmath124 .",
    "the similar estimations can be easily done for the case of a spinor up .",
    "the relative deviation of the model cross section of the boson - pair production with consequent decay of the bosons to fermion pairs is [ ] : @xmath125,\\ ] ] where @xmath126 is a boson mass . for the case",
    "@xmath127 a deviation is maximal , @xmath128 .",
    "it should be noted that the deviations that are caused by the approach at the tree level are significantly smaller then the errors caused by the uncertainty in taking account of radiative corrections [ ] .",
    "thus , the the error of the method at the tree level in the case of vector up is , as a rule , negligible .    by straightforward calculations we evaluate the relative deviations of the model partial width from standard one , that is , @xmath129 for the case of @xmath9 and @xmath130 decays .",
    "we get : @xmath131 the deviation is suppressed by the factor @xmath132 , which is small in the first and second case and large in the last case . in the case of the decay @xmath75 , suppression factor is very small , @xmath133 .    in the case of a spinor up in an intermediate state",
    "a deviation is of the order of @xmath134 .",
    "it can be large when @xmath29 is far from the resonance region .",
    "however , in analogy with vector up , this deviation can be suppressed by small factor too , and we have to control this effect in every case under consideration .",
    "the same effect can occur in the case of the vector - spinor up .",
    "the model of up s leads to effective theory of up s with a specific structure of vector , spinor and vector - spinor propagators .",
    "such a structure gives rise to the effects of exact factorization in a broad class of the processes with up s in intermediate states .",
    "these effects allow us to develop the factorization method for the description of the complicated processes with participation of an arbitrary type of up s .",
    "the method suggested is simple and convenient tool for deriving the formulae for cross sections and decay rates in the case of complicated scattering and decay - chain processes .",
    "the factorization method can be used as some analytical analog of nwa , which enables us to evaluate the error of the approach at the tree level in a simple way .",
    "we have shown that these errors , as a rule , are significantly smaller then the ones caused by the uncertainty in taking account of radiative corrections .",
    "it should be noted that the applicability of the method is limited to the energy scales where the non - resonant or non - factorizable contributions can be neglected .",
    "the factorization method based on the model of up with a smeared mass can be treated in two various ways . on the one hand",
    ", it follows from the specific structure of propagators and can be interpreted as some heuristic ( irrespective of the model ) way to evaluate decay rates and cross sections easily with the help of the concise and convenient expressions . on the other hand , the model , from which the factorization method follows ,",
    "is based on the fundamental properties of up  time - energy ur ( i.e. , smearing the mass ) .",
    "thus , the method can be also used as some physical basis for development of precision tools of rapid and easy calculations .",
