    "@xcite introduced the notion of geographic clustering , where each region contains a square of size @xmath14 and has diameter at most @xmath15 for a fixed constant @xmath16 , which is a special case of @xmath3-fat regions .",
    "they showed that the tspn with geographic clustering admits a ptas based on arora s framework for the euclidean tsp .    in all cases",
    ", @xmath3-fatness provides a lower bound ( in terms of their diameters ) on the length of a tour visiting disjoint regions , but in the following , the second definition will turn out to be more useful . throughout this paper",
    ", @xmath17 and @xmath18 will be constants .",
    "the core of mitchell s algorithm is dynamic programming , which requires certain restrictions on the space of solutions . to this end ,",
    "mitchell claims the following :    there is an almost optimal tour ( up to a factor of @xmath19 ) such that :    a.   the tour visits the minimum - diameter axis - aligned rectangle @xmath20 intersecting all regions , and therefore has to be located within a window @xmath21 of diameter @xmath22 intersecting @xmath20 .",
    "we distinguish internal regions @xmath23 that are entirely contained in @xmath21 , and external regions .",
    "b.   we can require the vertices of the tour to lie on a polynomial - size grid ( in @xmath1 and @xmath24 ) within this rectangle . c.   the tour is a connected eulerian graph fulfilling the  @xmath25-guillotine property \" ( which roughly states that there is a recursive decomposition of the bounding box of the tour by cutting it into subwindows such that the structure of internal regions and tour segments on the cut is of bounded complexity in @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , again at a loss of only @xmath28 for appropriately chosen @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "d.   the tour obeys ( b ) and ( c ) simultaneously .",
    "e.   the external regions can be dealt with efficiently as there is only a polynomial number of ways for them to be visited by an @xmath25-guillotine tour ( i. e. for every cut , there is a polynomial number of options for which regions will be visited on which side of it ) .    under these assumptions , mitchell states a dynamic programming algorithm .",
    "starting with a window ( axis - parallel rectangle ) @xmath21 , which is assumed to contain all edges of the tour , every subwindow @xmath29 defines several subproblems ( see figure  [ pic : sub ] ) .",
    "the subproblems also enumerate all possible configurations of edge segments intersecting its boundary , connection patterns of these segments , internal ( contained in @xmath21 ) and external ( intersecting @xmath30 ) regions to be visited inside and outside of the window , cuts ( horizontal or vertical lines dividing @xmath29 into two subwindows ) and configurations on the cut . for each cut , the subproblems to both sides will already have been solved through a bottom - up recursion , therefore we can select an optimal solution with compatible configurations .",
    "the optimum ( shortest ) solution for the subproblem ( among all possible cuts ) is stored and can be used for the next recursion level .",
    "assumption a is false , and will be rectified in section  [ sec : loc ] , lemma  [ lem : loc ] .",
    "statement b is correct . for the third statement , a stronger assumption on the regions can be used to mend the upper bound for the additional length incurred in mitchell s construction ; see section  [ sec : guillotine ] , theorem  [ thm : charge ] . preserving connectivity in a graph with guillotine property is difficult , not accounted for in @xcite and for mitchell s line of argument not clear .",
    "we present a counterexample in section  [ sec : cnn ] , figure  [ pic : region - span ] .",
    "while not proven by mitchell , statement d is still correct ( if assumption c holds for the given tour ) , a technical argument will be sketched in section  [ sec : grid ] . the last statement is again false , but can be fixed using a different notion of @xmath3-fatness , which we will show in section  [ sec : ext ] .      in mitchell s algorithm ,",
    "the search for a ( nearly ) optimal tour among a set @xmath0 of connected regions is restricted to a small neighborhood of the minimum - diameter axis - aligned rectangle @xmath20 that intersects all regions .",
    "there exists an optimal tour @xmath31 of the regions in @xmath0 that lies within the ball @xmath32 of radius @xmath33 around the center point @xmath34 of @xmath20 .",
    "however , figure  [ pic : loc ] shows that in general , this is false : a nearly optimal tour need not be within @xmath35 distance of @xmath20 , even if the regions are @xmath3-fat , disjoint and connected as in figure  [ pic : loc ] .",
    "the vicinity of @xmath20 only contains a @xmath36-approximation of the optimum , which is instead found within @xmath37 .",
    "we now show how this problem can be resolved : if an optimal tour intersected @xmath20 , mitchell s lemma would be correct .",
    "he argues that , if some regions were to be visited far away from @xmath20 , the path leading to them could be replaced by @xmath38 , which due to connectivity must visit those regions .",
    "otherwise , no region can be fully contained in @xmath20 , so the same argument yields that every region must intersect @xmath38 , making @xmath39 an upper bound for the length @xmath40 of an optimal solution . combining this with the fact that @xmath41 , @xmath40 is now known up to a constant factor .",
    "now , there are two cases to consider : if there is a small region ( of diameter @xmath42 ) , an area of diameter @xmath42 around this region must contain an optimal tour .",
    "otherwise , all regions are of diameter @xmath43 .",
    "if the regions are required to be polygons , it is possible to limit the number of possible ( approximate ) locations of an optimal tour by adapting an approach by j. gudmundsson and c. levcopoulos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.1 ) , who show that in that case a tour must be the boundary of a convex polygon .",
    "this additional structural information then allows them to deduce the existence of an optimal tour within @xmath42 of a vertex of one of the polygonal regions .",
    "considering rectangles of the right size ( since @xmath40 is known up to a constant factor ) yields the following lemma :    [ lem : loc ] for a set @xmath0 of disjoint , connected polygons in the plane with a total of @xmath44 vertices , @xmath45 rectangles of size @xmath42 can be found in polynomial time , such that an optimal tour of length @xmath40 is contained in at least one of them .",
    "if there were no further problems , a ptas could be obtained by applying mitchell s algorithm to all rectangles from lemma  [ lem : loc ] .",

    "@xmath81 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is clear from this definition that transforming a tour into an edge set with this property will induce an additional length that depends both on the edges and the regions present .",
    "the crucial property of a tour connecting disjoint , @xmath3-fat regions is that their number and diameter provide a lower bound on its length .",
    "it is worth noting that the following lemma holds for a tour among @xmath3-fat regions in either mitchell s ( definition  [ def : afat - mit ] ) or elbassioni s and fishkin s ( definition  [ def : afat - elb ] ) sense :    [ lem : afat - mit ] let @xmath82 , then there is a constant @xmath83 ( that depends on @xmath28 and @xmath3 ) , such that for every tspn - tour @xmath31 of length @xmath40 , connecting @xmath1 disjoint , connected , @xmath3-fat ( @xmath3-fat@xmath13 ) regions in the plane , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the sum of the diameters of the regions that are completely contained in the axis - aligned bounding box @xmath21 of @xmath31 .",

    "the following definitions were not explicitly given in @xcite and are therefore adapted from the corresponding definitions in @xcite for the standard tsp :    let @xmath54 be a cut through window @xmath29 , and @xmath90 a point on @xmath54 , then @xmath90 is called * @xmath57-dark * with respect to @xmath29 and an edge set @xmath49 , if @xmath90 is contained in the @xmath26-span of the cut through @xmath90 that is orthogonal to @xmath54 .    similarly , a point @xmath90 on a cut @xmath54 is said to be * @xmath66-region - dark * , if it is contained in the @xmath27-region - span of a cut through @xmath90 that is orthogonal to @xmath54 .",

    "while our definition of the @xmath27-region - span removes the ambiguity and ensures the correctness of the proof techniques used by mitchell , it yields a weaker ( but correct ) overall statement :    [ thm : charge ] let @xmath48 be an planar embedded connected graph , with edge set @xmath49 consisting of line segments of total length @xmath50 .",

    "to apply the lower bound on the optimum obtained from @xmath3-fatness as in the original paper , a further restriction can be imposed on the regions  that the ratio between the perimeter and diameter of regions is bounded by a constant , which is true , for example , for convex regions .",
    "since polygonal regions only ensure that this ratio is bounded by @xmath45 , this is a very restrictive assumption .",
    "note further that this theorem , as well as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) , does not establish the existence of a _ connected _ edge set with the properties of @xmath94 ; see section  [ sec : cnn ] .",
    "the proof relies on the following key lemma by mitchell :    [ lem : fav - cut ] for any planar embedded graph @xmath48 with edge set @xmath49 , any set of regions @xmath23 and any window @xmath29 , there is a favorable cut .",
    "now , given an edge set @xmath49 as in the theorem , we recursively find a favorable cut @xmath54 , add the @xmath26-span and @xmath27-region - span to @xmath49 and proceed with the two subwindows , into which @xmath54 splits the current window .",
    "this procedure terminates , because the proof of lemma  [ lem : wfav - cut ] yields that the cut can always be chosen to be at one of finitely many candidate coordinates since we assume that all vertices of the tour lie on a grid .    as for the additional length induced by the @xmath26-spans and @xmath27-region - spans",
    ", we know that it can be bounded by the length of the respective dark portions of the cuts in question . since @xcite omits some of the details , we will give them here .",
    "the charging scheme works as follows : every edge and the boundary ( in mitchell s version , diameter ) of every region is split up into finitely many pieces , to each of which we assign a `` charge '' that specifies which multiple of the length of that segment was added to @xmath49 as part of @xmath26-spans and @xmath27-region - spans .",
    "if we can establish that the charge for every edge segment is at most @xmath97 , the charge for every region boundary is at most @xmath98 , and the @xmath26-span and @xmath27-region - span never get charged during the recursive process , we obtain the statement of theorem  [ thm : charge ] .",
    "let @xmath54 be a favorable cut .",
    "the charging scheme for the edge set is described in @xcite : for each @xmath26-dark portion of @xmath54 , the @xmath99 inner edge segments ( the @xmath26 segments closest to the cut on each side ) are each charged with @xmath100 . in the recursive procedure",
    ", each segment @xmath101 can be charged no more than once from each of the four sides of its axis - parallel bounding box , since in order for it to be charged , there have to be at least @xmath26 edges to the corresponding side of it , but there are less than @xmath26 edges between @xmath101 and any cut that charges it .",
    "therefore , after placing a cut and charging @xmath101 from one side , there will be less than @xmath26 edges to the respective side of @xmath101 in the new subwindow , preventing it from being charged from that direction again .    thus , each side of the axis - parallel bounding box of the segment gets charged @xmath102 times , and since the perimeter of the bounding box is at most @xmath103 times the length of the edge segment @xmath101 , it gets charged no more than @xmath97 times in total .",
    "the @xmath26-span and @xmath27-region span never get charged , because after they are inserted , they are not in the interior of any of the windows which are considered afterwards .    with definition  [ def : region - span ] of the @xmath27-region - span , it is possible to replace the regions by their boundaries ( which form a polygonal edge set of total length @xmath96 ) and to treat them the same way as the edge set @xmath49 ( in particular , the @xmath27-region - span and @xmath27-region - dark parts become @xmath27-span and @xmath27-dark ) .        for mitchell s original definition ( definition  [ def : m - region - span ] ) of the @xmath27-region - span , a scenario as in figure  [ pic : charging - problems ] can become a problem .",
    "every black line pictured is a favorable cut , every red line segment is @xmath72-region - dark on the respective cut ( even if the window in question has been cut by the black line directly below and above already ) .",
    "the total length of the red line segments is however proportional to the perimeter , not the diameter , of the blue and green regions .    within one window ,",
    "mitchell s statement holds ; the problem with his definition is its lack of a monotone additive behavior : when cutting a window @xmath29 into two parts , the sum of the diameters of all relevant regions is @xmath29 might be less than the sums of the diameters of the relevant regions for each subproblem combined , and while no part of the diameter of a region is charged more than @xmath98 times in each subproblem , the combined charge might still be greater than @xmath98 .      in order for the dynamic programming algorithm to work , the number of possible endpoints for an edge has to be restricted ( for example , to a grid ) . in @xcite",
    ", an optimal solution will thus first be moved to a fine grid through slight perturbation , and subsequently transformed into an @xmath46-guillotine subdivision .",
    "mitchell claims that there is always a favorable cut that has grid coordinates , arguing that in the charging lemma ( lemma  [ lem : wfav - cut ] ) , the functions considered are piecewise linear between grid points , therefore the maximum of such a function must be attained at a grid point .",
    "the proof fails to take into account that the function might be discontinuous ( and not even semi - continuous ) at grid points .",
    "even if this were true , it is not in general true in the euclidean case ( unlike the rectilinear case ) that the @xmath26-span ends at a grid coordinate on the cut ( for example , it could instead end at an interior point of an edge ) .",
    "a ( slightly technical ) solution to this uses a weaker version of this claim , i. e. that a favorable cut has to be at a grid coordinate or the mean value of two consecutive grid points , which follows from the simple observation that when integrating affine functions over an interval , the sign of the integral is the same as the sign of the function value at the midpoint of the interval .",
    "this can be used in the proof of lemma  [ lem : fav - cut ] as follows : the existence of a favorable cut is shown via changing the order of integration  then the integral of the length of the dark portions along the @xmath104-axis is the same as the integral of the length of the spans along the @xmath105-axis , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , there is one axis , such that there is more dark than spanned area in that direction , i. e. the total area of all dark points with respect to some horizontal ( resp .",
    "vertical ) cut is greater than the area of all points that are contained in some horizontal ( resp .",
    "vertical ) cut .",
    "thus , there has to be a single cut with that property as well : a favorable cut .",
    "if all previous edges and regions are restricted to the grid , the aforementioned observations imply that in particular , there is a favorable cut at a grid coordinate or in the center between two consecutive ones .",
    "it can then be shown that a non - empty @xmath26-span in an optimal solution always has a certain minimum length , or it contains a grid point .",
    "this observation allows us to slightly modify the edge set , so that a cut becomes @xmath26-good , while all edges still have grid endpoints .",
    "the @xmath27-region - span can be dealt with in a similar way . moving it to the grid",
    "requires a slight change in the definition of the @xmath106-guillotine property , which will preserve its algorithmic properties . however , there are further problems with the @xmath27-region - span , which will be explained in the following section .      to transform an optimal tour into an @xmath46-guillotine subdivision ,",
    "the @xmath26-span and @xmath27-region - span of a favorable cut are inserted into the edge set through a recursive procedure .",
    "the @xmath26-span is always connected to the original edge set @xmath49 , since its endpoints are intersection points of the cut with @xmath49 .",
    "this is not true for the @xmath27-region - span , and in fact , it can be `` far away '' from @xmath49 , as seen in figure  [ pic : region - span ] .",
    "the optimal tour ( green ) and the @xmath72-region - span @xmath107 of the favorable cut @xmath54 ( which is favorable , because the two grey squares at the top make a portion of @xmath54 with the same length as @xmath107 @xmath72-region - dark ) are far away from each other .",
    "connecting it to the tour does not preserve the approximation ratio of @xmath108 .",
    "-region - span , width=113 ]    note that , in the dynamic programming algorithm , we can not afford to decide whether to connect the @xmath27-region - span of a cut to the edge set : if we choose not to connect it , we have to decide which subproblems is responsible for each region on the @xmath27-region - span , but this is exactly what was to be avoided by introducing it in the first place .",
    "on the other hand , if we do connect the @xmath27-region - span to the edge set , both its length and its possible interference with other subproblems have to be taken care of . with the second definition of @xmath3-fatness ( definition  [ def : afat - elb ] ) , which implies the lower bounds mentioned in section  [ sec : ext ]",
    ", the length of a segment connecting the @xmath27-region - span to @xmath49 could be charged off to the length of the @xmath27-region - span itself , whereas mitchell s definition of @xmath3-fatness does not even guarantee this ( because in the proof of the lower bound , we relied on the regions being contained in the bounding box of the tour ) .",
    "it is not clear whether the connection of tour and region - span intersects another subproblem , possibly violating the @xmath46-guillotine property there , therefore even for @xmath3-fat@xmath13 regions , this problem remains open .",
    "in addition to dealing with the internal regions @xmath23 , the dynamic programming algorithm has to determine how to visit external regions .",
    "mitchell s strategy is to enumerate all possible options , restricting the complexity with the following argument : given a situation as in figure  [ pic : sub ] , with some external regions protruding from the outside into a subproblem @xmath29 , we know that since there are only @xmath109 edges on each side of @xmath29 , they can be split into @xmath109 intervals of regions , such that along the corresponding side of @xmath29 , the regions are consecutive with no edges passing through @xmath110 between them ( e. g. the red , green and blue region in figure  [ pic : sub ] ) .",
    "it seems clear now that , in order for the green region to be visited by an edge outside of @xmath29 , either the red or the blue region would have to be crossed as well .",
    "if this were true , it could be deduced that the set of regions in one of the intervals in question that are not visited outside @xmath29 , and that thus @xmath29 is responsible for , is a connected subinterval , leading to @xmath111 possibilities for each interval and @xmath112 possibilities overall for each window @xmath29 .",
    "this argument fails if the green region has a disconnected intersection with @xmath21 .",
    "an example is given on the left in figure  [ pic : ext ] : an @xmath46-guillotine tour can visit any subset of the regions outside of @xmath29 , thus there is no polynomial upper bound on the number of possibilities anymore .",
    "mitchell s argument holds for convex regions , but as seen left in figure  [ pic : ext ] , in general it does not apply to disjoint , connected , @xmath3-fat regions . the number of regions such that their intersection with @xmath21 ( or even a slightly extended rectangle ) is disconnected could be @xmath113 , for example if the construction in figure  [ pic : ext ] is extended beyond the yellow region , which is possible , because the regions here actually become `` more fat '' as their size increases , i.e. @xmath3 decreases and eventually converges to 2 .",
    "it can be shown that in order for this to be a problem , the size of the regions has to increase exponentially due to the logarithmic lower bound in the packing lemma , and the fact that the boundary of @xmath21 is a tour of the external regions .",
    "one solution is therefore to restrict the diameter of the regions ; many of the approximation algorithms for similar problems do in fact require the regions to have comparable diameter ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "we have to show that this procedure terminates . but",
    "this follows from the fact that all cuts are weakly central : each recursion step reduces one coordinate of the window by at least 1 or @xmath189 of its width / height .",
    "we only add new edges in the interior of a subwindow when the @xmath190-region - span is non - empty , therefore , for small enough windows , we do not add edges to the interior of their subwindows . at that point , the minimum length , width and height of an edge inside of the window",
    "remains fixed , so at some point , all edges that lie completely in the interior of @xmath29 will be axis - parallel , and as soon as one coordinate gets small enough , all of them are parallel .",

    "( more precisely , these are not necessarily the same edges or even connected , but there are edges of total length at least @xmath193 within the same window such that their orthogonal projection onto @xmath54 intersects at most @xmath194 other edges in @xmath172 .",
    "we can charge all of those with @xmath195 . )    similarly , there are disk boundary segments of total length @xmath196 making parts of the cut @xmath133-region - dark .",
    "we can charge each of them with @xmath197 .    in total ,",
    "the charged length is @xmath198 , because the cut is @xmath140-favorable .",
    "we also know that @xmath199 , because the additional segments in @xmath67 both visit 12 disks .",

    "@xmath26-span , @xmath176-region - span , and possibly a connecting segment of length at most 2 .",
    "so the charge indeed will be an upper bound on the additional length as described in the beginning of the proof .",
    "it remains to show that each segment is charged directly only a constant number of times , and that the total indirect charge is sufficiently small .    for edge segments ,",
    "there are at most @xmath194 other segments between a charged segment @xmath101 and the cut @xmath54 . but",
    "the cut then becomes the boundary of the next subwindow .",
    "therefore , this edge will not make a cut @xmath201 between @xmath101 and @xmath54 @xmath26-dark , and not be charged again from this direction . since all cuts are axis - parallel , each edge is indeed only charged at most 4 times .    for disks ,",
    "the same argument works : only the @xmath133 disks closest to a cut ( and making it @xmath133-dark or even @xmath27-dark ) in a given direction are charged , and each disk can only be among those and make the cut @xmath133-dark once for each direction .    finally , we have to take care of indirect charge .",
    "this applies to both disks and edges , because while our analysis shows that we can upper bound the additional length for the connecting segments by the @xmath27-region - span , the length of this span may be accounted for by @xmath26-dark and not by @xmath133-region - dark segments .",
    "but for each edge segment , the direct charge is at most @xmath202 .",
    "the segment of that length might be charged with @xmath202 again , adding a charge of @xmath203 to the original segment , yielding a geometric series .",
    "therefore , the total charge is at most @xmath204 for @xmath205 .    for disks ,",
    "the same analysis works : the direct charge is at most @xmath197 , and since @xmath205 , the indirect charge is bounded by @xmath206 .",
    "finally , we duplicate each new edge segment to make the resulting graph eulerian , increasing the additional length by a factor of 2 .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "we did not use the fact that the regions are unit disks : it it sufficient to assume they are disk - like and modify the constants accordingly .      by computing a @xmath52-approximation of a tour visiting the centers of the disks ,",

    "the same can be done for an optimum solution , i. e. every edge should begin and end in a grid point . such a solution is still feasible , if we replace each disk @xmath213 by the convex hull of the set of grid points @xmath214 it contains .",
    "as this convex hull contains at least the diamond inscribed in the disk ( a square of area 2 ) , and it has rotational symmetry , it will still be @xmath3-fat@xmath13 , for slightly smaller @xmath3 .",

    "this sum is equal to the integral .",
    "if the @xmath26-span and @xmath27-region - span are inserted at half - grid cuts ( with their endpoints not even at half - grid points ) , the solution does not remain on the grid .",
    "in particular , the connecting segment for the @xmath27-region - span could lead to discontinuities in @xmath58 and @xmath134 at non - grid points , thus preventing the recursive application of this lemma . therefore , it will be moved to the grid in the following .",
    "we can assume that every disk is visited by the endpoint of an edge that lies on the grid .",

    "first , note , that `` smaller '' subproblems never rely on the fact that their containing windows are guillotine , because they do not yet know the respective cuts  with the exception of the four cuts defining their boundaries .",
    "for these cuts , we can easily enumerate the possibilities `` visit all regions in the @xmath27-region - span '' and `` visit none of them '' .",
    "intuitively , it seems that this construction would significantly increase the length of the subdivision .",
    "but we know that those regions can be visited by a segment with at most the length of the @xmath27-region - span . more importantly , we know that they can be visited on each side of the cut by a segment such that their combined length is at most @xmath233 , which we can afford by the charging scheme .",
    "not both of these can necessarily be connected to @xmath49 within their containing window ( but at least one ) , therefore we should add ( or at least `` reserve '' ) an edge across the cut , i. e. only obtain an @xmath234-guillotine subdivision .    to accommodate these changes , we redefine @xmath27-region - good and",
    "thus obtain a new @xmath25-guillotine property :    a cut @xmath54 is * @xmath66-region - good * with respect to @xmath29 , @xmath23 and @xmath49 , if there are no two regions @xmath235 that intersect the @xmath27-region - span of @xmath54 , but @xmath49 visits @xmath236 and @xmath237 only on different sides of the cut .",
    "in other words , if @xmath54 does not visit @xmath236 on one side of the cut , it must visit all other regions that intersect the @xmath27-region - span on the other side of the cut . here , `` side of the cut '' denotes a closed half - space ; in particular , a cut that was @xmath27-region - good w. r. t. the previous definition remains @xmath27-region - good , since the @xmath27-region - span is in @xmath49 and thus @xmath49 visits all regions in the @xmath27-region - span on both sides of the cut .",
    "the following two lemmas show that this construction works  for both edges and regions , we can replace the operations `` insert the span '' by one of the following in the charging scheme , and get the statement of the charging scheme ( with modified constants ) for grid - rounded subdivisions .",
    "[ lem : m - good ] given a perfect half - grid cut @xmath54 in a window @xmath29 of width @xmath126 , and a connected eulerian grid - rounded edge set @xmath49 , then there is a grid - rounded edge set @xmath94 that differs from @xmath49 only at edges intersecting @xmath29 , has the @xmath238-guillotine property outside of @xmath29 if @xmath49 does , is by at most an additive @xmath239 longer than @xmath49 , visits the same ( or a superset ) of the grid points @xmath94 visits , and is connected and eulerian , such that @xmath54 is @xmath240-good w. r. t. @xmath94 and @xmath29 .    if the window has width @xmath241 , then the constructions in the proof might not be inside of the window .",
    "on the other hand , such a window is @xmath25-guillotine by definition , since it can not contain ( the entire interior of ) grid edges in its interior .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath54 be a vertical cut .",
    "if @xmath54 is @xmath240-good , there is nothing to show . otherwise , there are at least @xmath242 edges on the @xmath26-span , so it has length at least @xmath116 by lemma  [ lem : span ] , or @xmath49 can be made shorter by applying the construction there , thereby making the cut @xmath243-good .",
    "if @xmath218 , there are two cases : if @xmath54 is not on the grid , as in figure  [ pic : half - cut ] , we insert an `` h '' shape , which has length @xmath244 . for all edges intersecting this h , the intersection point should be moved to a grid point without increasing the length or violating guillotine property .         to see that the length does not increase , let @xmath245 be the endpoints of an edge intersecting the h , then replacing the edge by segments from @xmath90 to the first intersection point @xmath246 and from the last intersection point @xmath247 to @xmath14 preserves connectivity ( and parity can be correcting using edges of the h ) .",
    "let @xmath90 be to the left of @xmath54 , then @xmath246 is either the left vertical edge or the bar . in the latter case ,",
    "moving the intersection point to the left endpoint of the bar only decreases the length of the segment . in the former case ,",
    "@xmath246 is either a grid point or can be moved vertically on the h. in that case , either the edge from @xmath90 to @xmath246 is horizontal ( so @xmath246 is a grid point because @xmath90 is ) , or there is a direction such that the angle at @xmath246 gets less acute when moving @xmath246 , thereby making @xmath248 shorter . whenever @xmath248 intersects a grid point , we subdivide it and continue with the segment containing @xmath246 , thus ensuring that the edge set remains planar an @xmath238-guillotine , if @xmath49 is .",
    "the resulting graph is grid - rounded and @xmath54 is @xmath26-good , since the @xmath26-span only contains one point , and this point is part of the edge set .",
    "it might not be eulerian , but the only points whose parity might have changed are on the h , hence duplicating some of its edges will make the edge set eulerian again .",
    "if the cut is at a grid coordinate , we increase the length of the @xmath26-span by at most @xmath249 as shown in figure  [ pic : span - again ] ( so that it becomes grid - rounded ) and then proceed analogously to the first case for all edges intersecting it .",
    "[ lem : region - good ] given a perfect half - grid @xmath240-good cut @xmath54 in a window @xmath29 , and a connected eulerian grid - rounded edge set @xmath49 and grid - rounded disk - like regions @xmath0 , then there is a grid - rounded edge set @xmath94 that differs from @xmath49 only in edges intersecting of @xmath29 , is @xmath250-guillotine outside @xmath29 if @xmath49 is , is by at most an additive @xmath251 longer than @xmath49 , visits the same ( or a superset ) of the grid points @xmath94 visits , and is connected and eulerian , such that @xmath54 is @xmath252-good and @xmath253-good w. r. t. @xmath94 , @xmath0 and @xmath29 .",
    "the constant @xmath83 here depends on the constants for the disk - like regions ( definition  [ def : grid ] ) and can be chosen as 24 for unit disks .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let @xmath54 be vertical .",
    "if @xmath54 is at a grid coordinate , extend @xmath254 to the grid and move all intersection points with edges to the grid as in previous lemmas .",
    "correct parity on the extended @xmath253-region - span .",
    "otherwise , since the regions are polygonal , the set of regions in the @xmath253-region - span can be visited by a vertical segment of at most the same length either at the grid coordinate directly to the left or to the right of @xmath54 .",
    "insert this segment and possibly a connecting segment to the edge set ( which might cross the cut ) inside of @xmath29 . for all edges intersecting the new vertical segment , proceed as before . for the connecting segment , note that it is not necessarily rectilinear .",
    "therefore , if it intersects an edge , we can subdivide this edge and move the intersection point to a grid point .",
    "this costs at most @xmath230 , because there are 3 incident edges , and connects to the edge set  hence it is sufficient to do this at most once . since @xmath255 by choice of @xmath83 ,",
    "this is not too expensive , and can be done inside @xmath29 .",
    "again , correcting parity is only necessary on new segments .    applying these lemmas to the charging scheme yields that there is an @xmath25-guillotine grid - rounded subdivision that approximates a tour well ,",
    "more precisely :    [ thm : grid ] let @xmath18 .",
    "for every set @xmath131 of @xmath256 disjoint unit disks within a square of size @xmath257 , let @xmath258 and @xmath259 .    then , there is an edge set @xmath49 with the following properties :    1 .",
    "it satisfies the ( new ) @xmath260-guillotine property .",
    "2 .   the endpoints of every edge are on a regular rectilinear grid with edge length @xmath261 .",
    "it visits at least one point from each of @xmath262 , the grid points of the slightly perturbed , polygonal approximations of the disks .",
    "it is eulerian and connected .",
    "the total length of all its segments is @xmath263 , where @xmath40 is the length of an optimum tour visiting @xmath131 ( or @xmath262 , as both lengths only differ by a factor of at most @xmath264 ) .",
    "this theorem implies an approximation ratio of @xmath265 for mitchell s dynamic programming algorithm for the tspn with disjoint unit disks , if the grid and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are chosen as above , and for these parameters , such a subdivision can be found by mitchell s algorithm ( together with the refinements to preserve grid - roundedness ) in polynomial time ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) .    using the two previous lemmas , one can construct @xmath94 as follows : starting with an optimal tour on the grid , recursively find a perfect half - grid cut , insert edges so that it becomes @xmath240-good and @xmath176-region - good , and continue with the new subwindows .",
    "the edge set remains a tour , and becomes @xmath266-guillotine .",
    "the increase in length can be bounded using the same charging scheme as in theorem  [ thm : guillotines ] .",
    "the guillotine subdivision method of mitchell @xcite can be used to derive a ptas for the tsp with unit disk neighborhoods .",
    "all arguments carry over to disk - like regions , for which mitchell s framework can be used to derive a ptas as well .",
    "this includes geographic clustering as the special case when the regions are @xmath3-fat ( they could be @xmath3-fat@xmath13 instead ) .    however , the approach of bodlaender et al .",
    "@xcite based on curved dissection in arora s ptas for tsp @xcite achieves a faster theoretical running time for disjoint connected regions with geographic clustering .",
    "their algorithm , like arora s , can be generalized to more than two dimensions .      for @xmath3-fat regions in mitchell s sense",
    ", the existence of a ptas remains open .",
    "the problem with external regions of section  [ sec : ext ] can be avoided by using @xmath3-fat@xmath13 or convex regions instead , the charging scheme ( section  [ sec : charge ] ) can be fixed by bounding the ratio of perimeter and diameter , the grid can be handled as in the unit disk case , and localization does not require any additional assumptions .",
    "however , even for those stronger conditions on the regions , it is unclear how to handle connectivity ( section  [ sec : cnn ] ) for neighborhoods of varying size .",
    "the length of the connecting segment can be bounded for @xmath3-fat@xmath13 regions as in the unit disk case , but it might still destroy the guillotine property of other windows . to our knowledge , no ptas for any form of the tsp with neighborhoods of varying size exists .",
    "mitchell s constant factor approximation algorithm for disjoint connected regions @xcite relies on the ptas for @xmath3-fat regions , but only applies it to disjoint balls , which are @xmath3-fat@xmath13 .",
    "therefore , a constant factor approximation algorithm by elbassioni et al .",
