    "this development has been greatly facilitated by the emergence of microcontact printing  @xcite as an important technique to cover solid substrates with designed chemical patterns . with this technique one can create surface patterns which consist of regular monolayer patches composed of different chemical species .",
    "these patterns are anchored at a homogeneous and flat substrate such that the resulting decorated surface remains flat on the molecular scale .",
    "such a patchwork of , e.g. , hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas with lateral extensions in the sub - micrometer range can be designed with high precision and turns out to be rather robust .    in view of the desired miniaturization of such structures",
    "the question arises to which extent thermal fluctuations limit the ability to keep adsorbed liquids with high lateral precision on the designated chemical patterns without spilling .",
    "moreover , one would like to know which chemical and structural architecture of the man - made surface is favorable for miniaturization .",
    "this requires to decode the relation between the structural properties of the highly inhomogeneous liquids and the molecular interaction potentials of the fluid particles and of the various , specificly arranged substrate particles .",

    "whereas the former theories are based on severe simplifications and focus on idealized systems on a macroscopic scale ( i.e. , @xmath0 m and larger ) , the latter require high computational efforts such that only rather small systems like pores and slits can be studied .",
    "our present analysis is supposed to provide a link between these two approaches in that it keeps track of the microscopic molecular interactions between the various constituents but leaves out fine structures on the molecular scale .",
