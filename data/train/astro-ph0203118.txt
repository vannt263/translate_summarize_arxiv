    "stellar isochrones are commonly used to predict or interpret the properties of distant stellar systems .",
    "two popular uses are to derive ages and metallicities of resolved stellar populations ( such as open and globular clusters ) and to determine the evolutionary state and ages of unresolved systems using the integrated light and synthetic stellar population models ( see e.g. stetson , vandenberg & bolte 1996 ; sarajedini , chaboyer & demarque 1997 ; jimenez , flynn & kotoneva 1998 ; carraro , girardi & chiosi 1999 ; chaboyer , green & liebert 1999 ; liu & chaboyer 2000 ; jimenez 1999 ) .",
    "the agreement between stellar theoretical models and the sun is outstanding ( e.g bahcall et al 2001 ) , but comparisons of models to data for other metallicities and masses is still an arduous task .",
    "comparisons of this type have been restricted in the past to open and globular clusters ( e.g. westera et al 2002 , cassisi et al 2000 ) , but in both cases distances and luminosities are a source of considerable uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , good agreement has been found between isochrones and data from globular clusters , i.e. isochrones at low metallicity are good . much more difficult to check is the accuracy of metal rich isochrones ( [ fe / h ] @xmath2 ) .",
    "our aim in this paper is to make such a comparison for stars on the lower main sequence ( k dwarfs ) , using the accurate distances ( and thus luminosities ) provided by the esa hipparcos mission .",
    "the width of the lower main sequence has long been held to be a consequence of the metallicities of the stars ( for a review see e.g. reid , 1999 ) . however , this has been difficult to test without having precise parallaxes and metallicities and furthermore the ability to remove multiple stars .",
    "the hipparcos catalogue makes this possible for the first time . in this paper",
    "we use hipparcos parallaxes of a sample of 213 nearby k dwarfs ( in the absolute magnitude range @xmath0 , or broadly g8 to k3 ) , for which photometric metallicities are available from kotoneva and flynn ( 2002 ) , to calibrate the luminosity of k dwarfs of a given colour as a function of metallicity and compare these luminosities to isochrones from the literature .    the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the sample . in section 3",
    "we compare different isochrone sets from the literature to stars of similar metallicity in the sample .",
    "having found that no isochrone set is able to fit the whole range of metallicities in the data , we construct an empirical calibration of the main sequence luminosity with the metallicity in section 4 .",
    "comparing with the original sample of spectroscopically analysed k dwarfs , the relation turns out to be surprisingly precise , and we discuss applications of this calibration in section 5 .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "we have chosen all stars in the survey part of the hipparcos output catalogue in the absolute magnitude @xmath3 range @xmath0 .",
    "we term these stars _",
    "k dwarfs_. the survey part of the hipparcos catalogue is complete to apparent visual magnitude @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the galactic latitude ( the apparent visual magnitude limit was made dependent on @xmath5 in order to avoid observing excessive numbers of stars in the galactic plane ) ( esa , 1997 ) .",
    "this @xmath6 magnitude limit results in 209 stars . to augment the basic sample we increased the magnitude limit by 0.9 mag ,",
    "i.e. the limit is @xmath4 + @xmath7 .",
    "this resulted in 668 k dwarfs .",
    "for all stars the parallax , proper motions and @xmath8 colour and apparent @xmath6 magnitude are available in the hipparcos catalogue ( for more details about the sample and the observations see kotoneva and flynn , 2002 ) .",
    "the photometrically determined metallicities for our k dwarfs is only appropriate for single stars . identifying the probable multiple stars was therefore very important .",
    "the hipparcos catalog includes a flag for so called `` probable multiple stars '' , based on the quality of the parallax and proper motion solutions .",
    "the stars were divided on this basis into `` probable single stars '' and `` probably multiple stars '' .",
    "we show the colour magnitude diagrams of the two groups in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "overlaid on the diagrams is a solar metallicity isochrone ( with an age of 11 gyr ) from jimenez , flynn and kotoneva ( 1998 ) .",
    "the probable single stars are scattered around this line much less than the multiple stars , as one would expect .    removing probable multiple stars reduced the sample to 449 stars ( or about 2/3 of the initial sample ) . despite this expedient ,",
    "a small number of binaries seem to remain in the sample ( as covered in detail in section 4 , fig 10 ) . after removing also these suspected multiple stars ,",
    "the final sample consists of 433 stars ( figure 1 ) .",
    "metallicities for 213 of the 433 single stars are available from the sample of kotoneva and flynn ( 2002 ) .",
    "the photometric metallicities are calibrated by a sample of 34 g and k dwarfs for which accurate , spectroscopically determined metallicity abundances , [ fe / h]@xmath9 and effective temperatures have been determined with errors of 0.05 dex and @xmath10 k , respectively ( flynn and morell , 1997 ) .",
    "photometric metallicities for the 213 stars come either from a method based on geneva @xmath11 and johnson - cousins @xmath12 colours ( flynn and morell , 1997 ) , or from a method based on strmgren @xmath13 and @xmath14 colours ( kotoneva and flynn , 2002 ) .",
    "both methods give metallicities accurate to 0.2 dex ( kotoneva and flynn , 2002 ) .",
    "in this section we have followed the method of jimenez , flynn and kotoneva ( 1998 , hereafter jfk ) to see how well different isochrone sets fit our sample .",
    "we have tested the following isochrone sets from the literature :    * an updated set of the macdonald isochrones ( macdonald , private communication ; see also jimenez and macdonald , 1996 ) , * the padova isochrones in their newest version ( girardi et al 2000 ) , * the siess et al ( 2000 ) isochrones , * the yonsei - yale ( yi et al 2001 , hereafter y@xmath15 ) isochrones , * the geneva models ( lejeune and schaerer , 2001 ) were used to test both johnson - cousins and the geneva photometric systems .    in general , only a few metallicities ( typically three )",
    "are computed in the isochrone sets , meaning that only a small subset of the data can actually be compared to the predictions of the isochrones .",
    "this was not the case for the yonsei - yale ( 2001 ) isochrones , because we were able to use the code by yi et al ( 2001 ) to generate isochrones for a complete range of metallicities .",
    "table 1 shows the different metallicities and helium content of the isochrone sets we tested . for the macdonald set we have isochrones for ages 10 , 12 and 14 gyr . for the padova , siess , y@xmath15 , and geneva sets we used ages 1 , 5 and 10 gyr .",
    ".the metallicities in @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ] and the @xmath18 value for the isochrone sets used . [",
    "cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     * for the hyades , we compute an absolute magnitude of the main sequence at @xmath19 of @xmath20 , which is in good agreement with the observed value of @xmath21 ( haywood 2001 ) . * for the open cluster m67 ( [ fe / h]@xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( richer et al 1998 , montgomery et al 1993 )",
    ". very deep ccd photometry by montgomery et al ( 1993 ) shows that the apparent magnitude of k dwarfs at @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to an observed absolute magnitude at @xmath27 of @xmath28 compared to an expected absolute magnitude of @xmath29 . *",
    "the open cluster ngc 2420 has been observed with hst by von hippel and gilmore ( 2000 ) , in order to detect the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "the advantage here is that the distance modulus is not determined from the main sequence . for",
    "their adopted metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath30 , reddening of @xmath31 and true distance modulus of 12.10 , eq .",
    "1 gives an absolute magnitude at @xmath27 of @xmath32 , close to the observed value of @xmath33 ( from an apparent @xmath34 , read from figure 7 of anthony - twarog et al 1990 ) .",
    "* the globular cluster 47 tuc has a metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath35 , @xmath36 and a ( white dwarf based ) true distance modulus has been determined by zoccalli et al ( 2001 ) of 13.09 : the apparent magnitude of the main sequence at @xmath37 is @xmath38 , or @xmath39 .",
    "this is not in good agreement with the absolute magnitude @xmath40 expected from eq .  1 .",
    "however , zoccalli et al ( 2001 ) found a distance modulus for 47 tuc somewhat shorter than obtained by traditional techniques ; in particular , the horizontal branch based distance modulus is @xmath41 ( corresponding to a main sequence absolute magnitude @xmath42 ) which does improve the agreement .",
    "of all the clusters studied here with distance moduli based on white dwarfs , 47 tuc is the only one in significant disagreement with the distance modulus using traditional techniques ( horizontal branch and/or main sequence fitting ) . *",
    "the globular cluster m4 has [ fe / h ] @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the expected luminosity at @xmath27 is @xmath45 .",
    "richer et al ( 1997 ) have derived an apparent @xmath6 band distance modulus for m4 of 12.5 from a fit to the white dwarf sequence on very deep hst images .",
    "reading from the colour magnitude diagram in alcaino et al ( 1997 ) , the apparent magnitude at @xmath46 is @xmath47 , which yields an absolute magnitude of @xmath48 in good agreement with @xmath45 . * the globular cluster ngc 6752 has [ fe / h ] @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the expected luminosity at @xmath27 is @xmath51 .",
    "renzini et al ( 1996 ) report a @xmath6 band distance modulus of 13.05 , based on the fit to the white dwarf sequence on deep hst images .",
    "reading from the colour magnitude diagram in penny and dickens ( 1986 ) , the main sequence at @xmath52 is at @xmath53 , leading to an absolute magnitude of @xmath54 , which is in good agreement with @xmath51 .",
    "the above calculations are summarised in table 5 .",
    "note that as far as possible we have used distance moduli which are independent of main sequence fitting , in order to avoid adopting moduli which are ultimately based on the same ( or similar ) subdwarfs to those studied here .",
    "overall the agreement between the observed luminosity of the main sequences at @xmath27 and the value obtained from eq .",
    "1 is satisfactory ; a more detailed study would be interesting .",
    "one should note that at very low metallicities , the metallicity - luminosity relation may not continue in the linear fashion shown in panel ( b ) of figure [ cmdkdwarfs ] .",
    "more k dwarfs with high ( super - solar ) and intermediate ( @xmath55[fe / h ] @xmath56 ) and hipparcos parallaxes would be of great interest in this regard , to check the linearity of the relation .",
    "there are presently no k subdwarfs with good parallaxes and metallicities below [ fe / h ] @xmath57 with which to check the relation at low metallicity .",
    "figure [ vversusv ] shows the observed absolute magnitudes @xmath3 at @xmath58 versus the value @xmath59 computed using eq .  1 .",
    "the tightness of the metallicity - luminosity relation for k dwarfs is a remarkable result for which there would be a wide range of applications .",
    "for example :    * _ galactic chemical evolution : _ for all k dwarfs in the hipparcos colour magnitude diagram , we can derive a metallicity with an accuracy of better than 0.1 dex , and thus a very clean and complete determination of the local metallicity distribution ( for comparison with models of galactic chemical evolution ) .",
    "this work will appear in a companion paper ( kotoneva et al 2002 ) .",
    "* _ new distance indicator : _ k dwarfs can be used as a distance indicator , since we can determine quite accurately the absolute magnitude of k dwarfs of a given colour and metallicity using eq .  1 , at least for metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath60 .",
    "k dwarfs could be used to determine a new set of distance moduli to open clusters , the galactic bulge , dwarf spheroidal galaxies , the magellanic clouds and most globular clusters , since for all of these we may have an independent metallicity estimate . * _ galactic structure : _ in a related study ( flynn , holmberg and lynch 2002 , in preparation ) we have found that using broadband @xmath61 photometry , we can yield metallicity estimates for k dwarfs of similar accuracy ( 0.2 dex ) to the methods described in kotoneva and flynn ( 2002 ) ( which use narrower band geneva or strmgren filters ) .",
    "thus , @xmath61 data could be used along various lines of sight to ( 1 ) measure the structural parameters of the galaxy , ( 2 ) measure the local metallicity distribution at various sites in the galaxy , such as the inner and outer disk , the bulge region , along the solar circle and perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "the metallicity distribution of stars as a function of position in the galactic disk would be an interesting constraint on chemical evolution studies of the galaxy .",
    "accurate distances would allow the stellar density of k dwarfs ( i.e. the luminosity / mass function ) in the stellar halo to be determined from simple star count data , and by extrapolating the mass function of these k dwarfs , the density of remnants in the stellar halo can be inferred .",
    "such remnants ( in white dwarfs ) might make up a fraction of the galactic dark matter ( oppenheimer et al 2001 , flynn et al 2002 ) .",
    "we are presently carrying out such a study ( flynn and holmberg , 2002 , in preparation ) . +",
    "a further obvious application is to the upcoming european space agency gaia mission which will measure @xmath61 , parallax , proper motion and radial velocity data for all k dwarfs within some 5 - 10 kpc . *",
    "_ helium : _ our calibration of the luminosity of k dwarfs as a function of [ fe / h ] can be used to test stellar models , which predict the luminosity more generally as a function of helium abundance @xmath18 and metals , @xmath16 .",
    "the use of models in conjunction with this luminosity constraint might permit an improved determination of the rate of change of helium with metals , @xmath62 ( pagel and portinari , 1998 ) .",
    "we have shown that the luminosity of lower main sequence k dwarf stars at a given colour is a simple function of metallicity ( @xmath63 } - 0.04577 $ ] ) .",
    "it was possible to show this because of the availability of ( 1 ) accurate hipparcos parallaxes , ( 2 ) a recently developed photometric metallicity index for k dwarfs and ( 3 ) the possibility to identify and remove the multiple stars from the sample .",
    "we have tested several sets of isochrones from the literature and we show that none of them fit the data completely , and in particular metal rich isochrones remain difficult to construct .    we have adopted the solar isochrone from jimenez , flynn and kotoneva ( 1998 ) as a fiducial line relative to which the luminosity of k dwarfs as a function of a metallicity has been empirically calibrated .",
    "the calibration stars are a small sample of k dwarfs with very accurate spectroscopically determined metallicities and hipparcos absolute magnitudes .",
    "we find that the relation is very precise and may be used to derive metallicities for k dwarfs based on their position in the colour - magnitude diagram with accuracies better than 0.1 dex .",
    "it is also a good distance indicator for k dwarfs if the metallicity can be independently established .",
    "this research was supported by the academy of finland through its antares program for space research and the emil aaltonen foundation and yrj , ville and kalle visl foundation ."
