    "this paper deals with an integro - differential equation that is defined in terms of the dislocation measure of a fragmentation process . given its probabilistic interpretation",
    "we consider this equation as an analogue of the one - sided fisher - kolmogorov - petrovskii - piscounov ( fkpp ) travelling wave equation in the context of fragmentation processes .",
    "in particular , we are concerned with the existence and uniqueness of solutions to this equation in the setting of conservative or dissipative homogeneous fragmentation processes and we derive certain analytic properties of the solutions when they exist .",
    "the fkpp travelling wave equation in the context of fragmentations has a similar probabilistic interpretation as the classical fkpp travelling wave equation whose probabilistic interpretation is related to branching brownian motions , see section  [ s.cfkppe ] . in this respect",
    "we also refer to @xcite , where the two - sided fkpp travelling wave equation for conservative homogeneous fragmentations is studied .",
    "it turns out that solutions in the setting of fragmentation processes have similar properties as their classical counterparts .",
    "however , the techniques of proving existence and uniqueness results are very different between the two cases , not least because the equations differ significantly . indeed , whereas the classical fkpp travelling wave equation is a differential equation of second order , the fkpp travelling wave equation in our setting is an integro - differential equation of first order .",
    "this difference results from the non - diffusive behaviour of fragmentation processes and the more complicated jump structure of fragmentations in comparison with branching brownian motions .    in the context of homogeneous fragmentation processes",
    "we prove the existence and uniqueness of one - sided travelling waves within a certain range of wave speeds .",
    "more precisely , the problem we are concerned with in this paper can be roughly described as follows .",
    "consider the integro - differential equation @xmath0 for certain @xmath1 and all @xmath2 , where the product is taken over all @xmath3 with @xmath4 . here",
    "the space @xmath5 is the space of partitions @xmath6 of @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the so - called dislocation measure on @xmath5 .",
    "this notation is introduced in more detail in the next section .",

    "our approach is based on using fragmentation processes with killing at an exponential barrier .",
    "these processes have been studied in @xcite and we briefly describe the corresponding concepts below .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we give a brief introduction to homogeneous fragmentation processes as well as appropriately killed versions of such fragmentations .",
    "subsequently , in section  [ s.fkppfrag ] we introduce the one - sided fkpp equation in our setting and we state our main results .",
    "afterwards , in the fourth section we provide some motivation for the problems considered in this paper by explaining some related results that are known in the literature on fragmentation processes and branching brownian motions , respectively . in section  [ s.fa ]",
    "we show how the existence and uniqueness of one - sided fkpp travelling waves for fragmentation processes can be obtained if the dislocation measure is finite .",
    "this provides some motivation for the existence and uniqueness result in the setting of general fragmentation processes , which this paper is mainly concerned with .",
    "the subsequent three sections are devoted to the proofs of our main results .    throughout the present paper",
    "we adopt the notation @xmath15 as well as the conventions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",

    "in this section we provide a brief introduction to partition - valued fragmentation processes and we present the main tools that we need in the subsequent sections . in addition , we introduce a specific killing mechanism for these processes . the advantage of partition - valued fragmentation processes compared to so - called mass fragmentations",

    "this structure is crucial for the killing mechanism that we introduce below .",
