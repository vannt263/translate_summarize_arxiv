    "despite nowadays transmission security is often implemented at higher layers , the idea of achieving it at physical layer has been the inspiring basis for the development of the modern theory of cryptography .",
    "when security is implemented at physical layer , all receivers share the same ( complete ) knowledge of the transmission technique , without the need of any form of secret sharing .",
    "the channel is responsible for differentiation among users , and security is only based on the differences among the channels experienced by authorized and unauthorized users .",
    "a very simple model that is well suited to represent physical layer security schemes is the _ wire - tap channel _ , first introduced by wyner in 1975 @xcite . in the wire - tap channel model",
    ", a transmitter ( alice ) sends information to the legitimate receiver ( bob ) , but this is also received by the eavesdropper ( eve ) .",
    "alice can adopt whatever randomization , encoding and modulation scheme before transmitting her message , and both bob and eve are perfectly aware of the transmission technique she uses ; so , at least in principle , they are both able to recover the plaintext message ( @xmath0 ) from the ciphertext ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the channel that separates alice from bob is generally different from that between alice and eve .",
    "for this reason , the ciphertext received by bob ( @xmath2 ) is different from that gathered by eve ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "so , after inverting the encoding map , the message obtained by bob ( @xmath4 ) can differ from that recovered by eve ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "a block scheme of the wire - tap channel is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : wiretap ] .",
    ", width=313 ]    based on these assumptions , physical layer security on the wire - tap channel is achieved when bob is able to exactly reconstruct the plaintext message , i.e. , @xmath6 , with very high probability , whereas the message recovered by eve has no form of correlation with @xmath0 .",
    "an important parameter for the wire - tap channel is the secrecy capacity , defined as the highest transmission rate at which eve is unable to decode any information .",
    "a lot of literature is devoted to studying the wire - tap channel capacity and how to achieve it . for a detailed discussion on the wire - tap channel and the secrecy capacity ,",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the literature confirms that an increasing attention has been devoted to the application of classic and modern coding techniques on the wire - tap channel @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we are interested in the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) wire - tap model , where the secrecy capacity equals the difference between the two channel capacities @xcite .",
    "so , in order to achieve transmission security , bob s channel must have higher signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) than eve s channel .",
    "alternatively , a feedback channel between alice and bob ( also accessible to eve ) is needed @xcite , but such case is not considered in this paper .    in the context defined above , an important parameter is the _ security gap _ , that expresses the quality difference between bob s and eve s channels required to achieve a sufficient level of physical layer security .",
    "an important target is to keep the security gap as small as possible , in such a way as to achieve physical layer security even with a small degradation of eve s channel with respect to bob s one .",
    "some recent literature has been devoted to the study of the way such reduction can be achieved by exploiting techniques from coding theory @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate how the security gap can be reduced by exploiting non - systematic transmission , in which the information bits are not in clear within the transmitted codewords , but are scrambled during encoding . in particular we show that such solution , suitably combined with error correcting codes , can outperform other schemes , recently proposed , based on punctured codes , as it provides smaller secrecy gaps for a given set of parameters . both the cases of hard - decoded classic block codes ( e.g. , bch codes ) and modern soft - decoded block codes ( e.g. , ldpc codes ) are considered and reveal to be equally effective .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : two ] we introduce the notation . in section [ sec : three ] we describe the coding scheme and the role of scrambling . in section [ sec : four ] the analysis is extended to the case of non - systematic ldpc codes . in section [ sec : five ] we compare the secrecy gap performance of the various solutions considered . finally , section [ sec : six ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider an awgn wire - tap channel model in which alice sends a secret message in the form of a @xmath7 binary vector @xmath0 . before transmission ,",
    "the secret message is encoded by alice into a @xmath8 binary word @xmath1 , with @xmath9 , that is then transmitted over the channel .",
    "the _ secrecy rate _",
    "@xmath10 is defined as the ratio between the secret message length and the transmitted word length .",
    "so , in the case we consider , the secrecy rate coincides with the transmission rate :    @xmath11    more in general , it should be @xmath12 , since part of the transmitted information bits could be non - secret .",
    "the special case @xmath13 is considered here for the sake of simplicity .",
    "the transmitted word is received by bob and eve through two different channels .",
    "we denote by @xmath2 the word received by bob and by @xmath3 the word received by eve , respectively .",
    "bob s and eve s channels are corrupted by awgn with different snr : @xmath14 is bob s channel energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio , whereas @xmath15 is the same parameter for eve s channel .",
    "similarly , @xmath16 is bob s bit error rate and @xmath17 is eve s one .",
    "security at physical layer is achieved when bob has bit error rate lower than a given threshold , @xmath18 , while eve s bit error rate is greater than another threshold ( next to @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 .",
    "starting from the curve of bit error rate as a function of the signal - to - noise ratio for the transmission technique adopted , these two values can be expressed in terms of @xmath21 , and the security gap @xmath22 is easily obtained as follows :    @xmath23    several works have been devoted to the study of what transmission techniques are best suited to reduce the security gap . in particular , in @xcite , the authors propose the usage of punctured codes , by associating the secret bits to punctured bits .",
    "they consider punctured ldpc codes and prove that such technique , for a fixed secrecy rate , is able to guarantee a considerable reduction in the security gap with respect to non - punctured ( systematic ) transmission .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an alternative solution , based on non - systematic coding .",
    "as we will show in the following sections , non - systematic coding is also able to achieve a strong reduction in the security gap , that becomes comparable ( and even better ) than that obtained through puncturing .",
    "in the scheme we consider , alice implements the encoding map as follows :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the @xmath26 generator matrix of an @xmath27-linear block code in systematic form , and @xmath28 is a non - singular @xmath29 binary scrambling matrix . due to its systematic character , @xmath25",
    "can also be written as @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 is a @xmath29 identity matrix and @xmath32 is a @xmath33 matrix representing the parity - check constraints .",
    "this settings resembles that of the mceliece cryptosystem @xcite , where , in addition , the encoded word is also permuted .",
    "based on these assumptions , the encoded word can also been written as @xmath34 = \\left[\\mathbf{c}_l | \\mathbf{c}_r \\right]$ ] , where @xmath35 is the vector containing the first @xmath36 bits of @xmath1 , while @xmath37 collects its last @xmath38 bits .",
    "both bob s and eve s channels introduce errors .",
    "however , as mentioned , @xmath14 must be large enough to ensure that , with very high probability , bob s decoder is able to correct all errors , thus delivering , after descrambling , @xmath39 .",
    "on the contrary , @xmath15 must be small enough to ensure that , after decoding , the codeword obtained by eve is still affected by an error vector @xmath40 .",
    "so , in this case , at the output of the descrambler , eve has :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the left part of the error vector @xmath43 $ ] . from we notice that descrambling has the effect of spreading the residual errors after decoding .    for the goals of the present paper , it is preliminarily useful to obtain , in analytical terms , an estimate of the bit error rate ( @xmath44 ) and frame error rate ( @xmath45 ) for bob and eve in absence or in presence of scrambling . for such purpose",
    ", we first refer to two explicative cases , namely , unitary rate coding and _ t_-error correcting coding . in the next section , we will provide further results , based on numerical simulations , in which we consider ldpc coding and we will compare the proposed approach with that based on puncturing .      we can consider the case of unitary rate coding by imposing @xmath46 and @xmath25 coincident with a @xmath29 identity matrix @xmath47 .",
    "if we also assume @xmath48 , the unitary code is systematic , and the system reduces itself to a framed uncoded transmission . focusing attention on the case of binary phase shift keying ( bpsk ) , the bit and frame error probabilities are given by :    @xmath49    in order to estimate the effect of the non - systematic transmission induced by the introduction of a scrambling matrix with row and column weight @xmath50 , we can first refer to an ideal case .",
    "such ideal case is what we call _ perfect scrambling _ ; it models a scrambling technique that , in presence of one ( or more ) error(s ) , produces maximum uncertainty .",
    "in other terms , under the hypothesis of perfect scrambling , a single residual bit error in the decoded word is sufficient to ensure that half of its bits are in error after descrambling . in practice ,",
    "perfect scrambling can be approached by using dense @xmath28 ( with dense @xmath51 ) matrices , that is , with a high density of @xmath52 symbols .",
    "a very high scrambling effect is obtained when the density of @xmath51 is @xmath19 , but also a lower density could suffice to achieve an almost perfect scrambling effect .",
    "it is easy to prove that , under the condition of perfect scrambling , the bit error rate after descrambling equals half the frame error rate expressed by , that is :    @xmath53^k\\right\\}. \\\\ \\label{eq : unitaryperfectscrambling}\\ ] ]    so , the condition of perfect scrambling can be used as a bound , since it gives eve s maximum bit error rate .",
    "when we instead adopt a real scrambling matrix , the bit error rate for a unitary rate coded transmission can be conveniently estimated .",
    "first of all , it is necessary to evaluate the bit error rate conditioned to erred frames , since scrambling is effective only on them .",
    "such probability can be expressed as :    @xmath54    if we denote by @xmath55 the hamming weight of the @xmath56-th column of @xmath51 , @xmath57 $ ] , an approximate estimate of the bit error rate on the @xmath56-th received bit after descrambling can be obtained by using arguments similar to those developed in @xcite and it is expressed :    @xmath58    as a numerical example , we have considered the case @xmath59 ( that will be of interest in the following ) and calculated the bit error rate for several degrees of scrambling . for the sake of simplicity , we have studied the case of regular scrambling matrices , that is , @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "[ fig : unitaryrate ] shows the curves of @xmath61 for some values of @xmath62 , and for the two limit cases of absence of scrambling ( unscrambled transmission ) and perfect scrambling .    ) for several levels of scrambling . [",
    "fig : unitaryrate],width=313 ]    as we observe from the figure , the unscrambled transmission gives low values of bit error rate even at rather low snr . on the contrary , by assuming a sufficiently large value of @xmath62 , scrambling permits us to keep the bit error rate close to @xmath19 ( corresponding to the case of complete lack of information ) up to a rather high @xmath21 threshold .",
    "in addition , scrambling helps to improve the slope of the @xmath44 curve , so reducing the security gap .",
    "as expected , perfect scrambling ensures the best performance , but an @xmath51 matrix with density @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is sufficient to have a similar ( optimal ) behavior .      in order to further improve the slope of the @xmath44 curves , a linear block code with dimension @xmath65",
    "can be introduced .    in this subsection",
    ", we consider the adoption of an @xmath27 linear block code able to correct @xmath66 bit errors under hard - decision decoding .",
    "such code could be , for example , a bose - chaudhuri - hocquenghem ( bch ) code ; in the following we will consider the @xmath67 bch code , able to correct @xmath68 errors .",
    "this code has a value of @xmath36 not so different from that considered in the previous subsection .",
    "when such a coding scheme is adopted , the frame error rate and bit error rate at the receiver can be estimated as follows :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the channel bit error rate , taking into account the bandwidth expansion due to the presence of the code : @xmath71    starting from eqs . , we can easily obtain that , in presence of perfect scrambling , the bit error rate of a transmission based on a @xmath66-error correcting code becomes :    @xmath72    based on these modified expressions , eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitaryscrambling ] ) can be used again .",
    "some examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : terrorcorrecting ] where we have considered a @xmath73 bch code with different levels of scrambling .",
    "bch code and different levels of scrambling .",
    "[ fig : terrorcorrecting],width=313 ]    by a comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : unitaryrate ] ( that , however , refers to a slightly different value of @xmath36 ) we see that the introduction of the code reduces the signal - to - noise ratio ( as obvious and expected ) and , mostly important for our purposes , increases the slope of the @xmath61 and @xmath74 curves .",
    "besides slope increase , scrambling contributes to emphasize the knee between the region of high bit error rate and that of low / medium bit error rate , that is the actual requirement for having a small secrecy gap . from fig . [",
    "fig : terrorcorrecting ] we see that @xmath75 ( density @xmath76 ) is enough for this purpose , while in absence of the code ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : unitaryrate ] ) @xmath64 ( density @xmath77 ) was necessary .",
    "as an example of soft - in soft - out modern error correcting schemes , we have considered ldpc codes , to which we have applied the approach of non - systematic transmission based on scrambling . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we have also considered the approach based on puncturing proposed in @xcite .",
    "non - systematic ldpc codes have been already studied outside the physical layer security issue . in particular , they have been proved able to give an important advantage over systematic encoding in the presence of source redundancy . in @xcite",
    "non - systematic ldpc codes for redundant source data are studied .",
    "non - systematic encoding is accomplished by using the same scrambling approach considered in this paper or through alternative techniques as _ post - coding _ and _",
    "splitting_.    a similar approach to the design of non - systematic ldpc codes is also presented in @xcite , where the authors aim at designing codes with sparse generator matrices , in such a way that the bit error rate performance remains not far from that of systematic ldpc codes .",
    "we notice that such target is diametrically opposed to physical layer security .    in our simulations , we have considered two ldpc codes designed through the progressive edge growth ( peg ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "both codes have a lower triangular parity - check matrix , in such a way as to allow systematic encoding without the need of gaussian elimination .",
    "the first code has length @xmath78 , dimension @xmath79 ( hence , code rate @xmath80 ) and it has been used for simulation of systematic and non - systematic transmission .",
    "the latter has been obtained by adopting a dense @xmath81 scrambling matrix , in order to approach the effect of a perfect scrambler .",
    "the second code has length @xmath82 and dimension @xmath79 .",
    "it has been used to simulate punctured transmission , by puncturing all its @xmath83 information bits .",
    "so , the transmission rate results in @xmath84 , as for the cases without puncturing .     and @xmath80 , adopting systematic transmission , puncturing and scrambling . [",
    "fig : ldpc],width=313 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : ldpc ] shows the simulated performance , in terms of bit error rate , for the considered transmission schemes based on ldpc codes .",
    "as we observe from the figure , the systematic transmission ensures the best performance in terms of error correction capability .",
    "however , in the considered context of physical layer security , it shows an important drawback , that is , a bit error rate significantly smaller than @xmath19 even at low signal - to - noise ratio ( the same behavior was observed in figs . [",
    "fig : unitaryrate ] and [ fig : terrorcorrecting ] ) .",
    "the approach based on puncturing gives worse error correcting performance , with a loss of about @xmath19 db in the waterfall region with respect to systematic ldpc coding .",
    "however , the usage of punctured bits for transmitting the secret message is able to ensure a higher bit error rate for low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "both such aspects could be improved by adopting non - systematic unpunctured ldpc codes based on the proposed scrambling technique : the performance loss with respect to the systematic ldpc code is about @xmath85 db in the waterfall region , and the bit error rate is maintained close to @xmath19 in a larger interval of signal - to - noise ratio values .",
    "these facts reflect on the security gap over the awgn wire - tap channel . discussion of the security gap and comparison of the considered techniques from this point of view are reported in the next section .",
    "in order to compare the considered transmission techniques , we have fixed @xmath86 , and calculated @xmath87 . starting from the value of @xmath87 , it is possible to estimate eve s bit error rate @xmath17 as a function of the gap @xmath22 .",
    "[ fig : bervsgap ] reports these curves for the considered transmission techniques . in the figure , for all techniques that adopt scrambling",
    ", the perfect scrambling condition has been considered ( simulation of the scrambled ldpc code has been done with a dense @xmath51 matrix , able to approach perfect scrambling ) .    ,",
    "width=313 ]    as we observe from the figure , the usage of a systematic ldpc code gives a very slow convergence of eve s bit error rate to the ideal value of @xmath19 .",
    "so , such technique requires a very high security gap for realistic values of @xmath88 ( that are usually @xmath89 ) .",
    "the reason of such a slow convergence is systematic transmission : if we adopt a non - systematic unitary rate code , even renouncing any error correction capability , performance is improved and @xmath90 is reached for a gap value around @xmath91 db . the situation can be further improved by adopting non - systematic error correcting codes . if we implement non - systematicity through puncturing , the condition @xmath90 is achieved at a @xmath92 db gap .",
    "the best performance is achieved by implementing non - systematic coded transmission through scrambling .",
    "both the bch and the ldpc code , under the condition of perfect scrambling , give very good performance .",
    "the condition @xmath90 is reached at @xmath93 db and @xmath94 db gap by the scrambled bch and ldpc code , respectively .",
    "obviously , ldpc codes have the advantage of permitting us to work at smaller snr .",
    "we have investigated the usage of non - systematic codes for achieving physical layer security .",
    "we have focused on the awgn wire - tap channel model , and estimated the security gap as a measure of the effectiveness of several transmission schemes .",
    "our results show that systematic coded transmission ( as well as uncoded transmission ) is unsuited to such kind of applications , due to the low bit error rate values it achieves even at low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "non - systematic transmission , instead , is able to reduce the security gap in terms of signal - to - noise ratio that is needed between bob s and eve s awgn channels in order to achieve physical layer security .",
    "we have compared non - systematic transmission implemented through scrambling and puncturing , and showed that the former is able to outperform the latter , requiring a smaller security gap .",
