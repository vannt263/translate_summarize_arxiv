    "one of the major problems of the standard model is a lack of understanding of the cp violating parameter @xmath1 characterizing the qcd sector of the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this parameter originates from the periodic vacuum structure of qcd and leads to an electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron , @xmath4 e - cm .",
    "the current experimental limit , @xmath5 e - cm @xcite , then implies that @xmath6 .",
    "why a fundamental parameter of the theory , @xmath1 , is so small compared to its natural value of order unity is the strong cp problem . a resolution of this problem is expected to provide important clues to the nature of new physics beyond the standard model .    when the standard model is embedded into its minimal supersymmetric extension ( mssm ) in order to solve the quadratic divergence problem associated with the higgs boson mass , one runs into another cp problem  the susy phase problem , or the susy cp problem .",
    "this problem owes its origin to the complex phases associated with the parameters in the soft susy  breaking sector of the theory  the @xmath7 term , gaugino masses , trilinear @xmath8 terms , etc .",
    "exchange of supersymmetric particles in loops will induce electric dipole moments ( edms ) for the neutron ( @xmath9 ) and the electron ( @xmath10 ) proportional to these susy phases .",
    "@xmath9 induced through gluino and squark exchange can be estimated to be @xmath11 e - cm @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a typical susy cp phase parameter and @xmath14 is the gluino / squark mass .",
    "( for this estimate we used @xmath15 and set the @xmath7 parameter and the gluino mass equal to the squark mass . ) in order to be compatible with the experimental limit on @xmath9 , the susy phase must obey @xmath16 for @xmath17 , unless the gluino contribution is precisely canceled by some other diagrams @xcite .",
    "why @xmath13 is so small , while the corresponding cp violating phase in the ckm matrix is of order one ( in order to explain the observed cp violation in the k meson system ) , is the susy phase problem .",
    "the susy phase problem becomes more acute if we attribute the recently reported 2.6 sigma discrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath18 ) measurement @xcite to supersymmetry .",
    "exchange of charginos / neutralinos and sleptons can account for the observed discrepancy in @xmath18 , provided that the masses of these particles are not more than about @xmath19 gev . now , if we replace the external muons in the diagram responsible for @xmath18 by electrons , a large edm for the electron will result , if the relevant susy phases are of order one .",
    "for example , if the susy contribution to @xmath18 is @xmath20 , @xmath10 can be estimated by scaling of the lepton mass to be @xmath21 e - cm . the current experimental limit on @xmath10 , viz .",

    "this bound will be tightened even further with the expected improvement in the limit on @xmath10 by about a factor of 2 @xcite .    solving the strong cp problem as well as the susy phase problem are therefore major challenges facing the ( supersymmetric ) standard model .",

    "the simplest possibility would appear to be to introduce just a single higgs bidoublet @xmath57 which gets a mass of order susy breaking scale .",

    "this is again not far from the present upper limit and with a mild fine  tuning of parameters , of order 10% , one gets the desired solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "one interesting aspect of the model presented here is that it is quite safe from potentially large corrections to @xmath1 induced by quantum gravity .",
    "if it is assumed that the high scale parity conserving theory originates from a more fundamental theory , one can expect nonrenormalizable operators in the theory suppressed by the mass scale associated with the fundamental theory .",
    "such corrections to @xmath1 will respect the gauge symmetry as well as the anomaly free @xmath131 discrete gauge symmetry .",
    "we should ensure two things : ( i ) the effective @xmath7 term induced by quantum gravity is not more than the weak scale , and ( ii ) the quantum gravity induced phases which may not respect parity do not upset the solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "all other constraints , such as the solution of the susy phase problem , will be automatically satisfied once these two are taken care of .    as for the magnitude and the phase of the effective @xmath7 term ,",

    "this will lead to @xmath284 , which is consistent with @xmath9 limit .",
    "this shows that the complex couplings @xmath282 can be of order one .",
    "the quark mass matrices can also have corrections from planck scale physics . the most relevant term is @xmath285 , which will induce corrections of order @xmath286 for some of the quark masses .",
    "the matrix structure need not be hermitian if quantum gravity violates parity .",
    "we suspect that gauged flavor symmetries ( discrete or continuous ) must exist in the underlying theory , or else the light fermion masses can become too large from quantum gravity .",
    "most likely the estimate of @xmath287 will apply for the third generation .",
    "if the coefficient of this non  renomralizable operator is of order @xmath288 , the solution to the strong cp problem via parity will be preserved .",
    "note that the superpotential coupling @xmath289 is not invariant under the discrete @xmath131 , unless accompanied by another factor @xmath290 .",
    "the correction to the quark mass matrix from this term is extremely small @xmath291 .",
    "we have verified that all other planck induced corrections are much below the experimental limits on @xmath1 .",
    "question can be raised as to the form of susy breaking parameters and if they indeed will respect parity symmetry . a complete answer to this",
    "will have to await a full understanding of non  perturbative susy breaking which is lacking at the moment .",
    "we note that perturbative gravity , which is utilized in conventional supergravity models of susy breaking may well respect parity  we have given an example in polonyi model .",
    "a second example is gauge mediated susy breaking . if susy is broken at a scale of @xmath292 gev , quantum gravity corrections for the @xmath7 term and the @xmath8 term , which will be of order gravitino mass , will of order @xmath293 gev .",
    "even if they are complex and non  hermitian , the strong cp problem will be solved , as the induced @xmath1 will be of order @xmath294 .",
    "we may use one of the other proposed solutions to generate a @xmath7 term of the weak scale in this case @xcite .",
    "if the messenger fields do not couple to the fields @xmath295 , they will not feel the effects of parity breaking , although parity is broken at @xmath296 gev .",
    "the effective susy breaking parameters will then obey the constraints of parity .",
    "the @xmath297 baryon number violating operator @xmath298 in the superpotential is forbidden in this model by @xmath131 symmetry , but the operator @xmath299 is allowed .",
    "if the associated couplings are order one for the light generations , we estimate proton lifetime induced by these operators to be @xmath300 yr .",
    "we have shown in this paper that it is possible to embed the supersymmetric standard model into a parity  symmetric framework at a unification scale of @xmath0 gev in a simple way .",
    "such an extension is well motivated by the data on neutrino oscillations as well as gauge coupling unification .",
    "we have demonstrated that this embedding can naturally solve the strong cp problem and the susy phase problem simultaneously .",
    "the effective low energy theory is the mssm , but with naturally small phases for the susy breaking parameters along with order one phase in the ckm matrix .",
    "thus it allows for large susy contributions to the muon @xmath301 , as indicated by experiment , without violating the bounds on the electron edm .",
    "the induced @xmath1 in these models depends strongly on the way susy breaking is communicated .",
    "with universality of squark masses and proportionality of the @xmath8 terms , we found @xmath302 , while with maximal deviation from universality and proportionality consistent with fcnc constraints @xmath303 . in the latter case",
