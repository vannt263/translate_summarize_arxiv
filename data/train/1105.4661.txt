    "the study of dark energy has become one of the most active fields in modern cosmology .",
    "considerable efforts have been expended to explore the nature of dark energy @xcite .",
    "recently , the agegraphic dark energy ( ade ) @xcite and new agegraphic dark energy ( nade ) @xcite models are motivated from the k@xmath0rolyh@xmath0zy uncertainty relation @xcite which tells us that the time @xmath6 in minkowski space - time can not be known to a better accuracy than @xcite ( see ref.@xcite for a recent review ) @xmath7 here @xmath8 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath9 is the reduced planck time . in this paper , we adopt the units @xmath10 .",
    "following @xcite , eq.([kur ] ) indicates that for a length scale @xmath6 , there exists a minimal detectable cell @xmath11 over a region @xmath2 .",
    "and the time - energy uncertainty relation indicates that the energy of the minimal cell can not be smaller than @xcite @xmath12 then the energy density of the metric fluctuations of the minkowski space - time is @xcite @xmath13 motivated by the equation , the energy density of ade was proposed to be @xcite @xmath14 here @xmath15 is a dimensionless constant parameter , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the age of the universe @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale factor , @xmath20 is the hubble parameter and a dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath6 .",
    "however , it is found that there exist some implicit inconsistences in the model that ade tracks the matter during the matter - dominated epoch @xcite and the ability of ade in deriving the accelerated expansion contradicts the existence of the radiation / matter - dominated epoch @xcite .    in order to address the drawbacks ,",
    "the nade model was proposed . in nade model",
    ", the energy density of dark energy was proposed to be @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the conformal age of the universe @xmath23 the nade model is very successful in fitting the observation data @xcite . however , in the nade model , there is one thing , which makes us uneasy , that the conformal age @xmath22 is not a physical scale and can be rescaled arbitrarily .",
    "we find that there may exist other ways out of the difficulties in the ade model .",
    "the relation ( [ ademetricfluc ] ) , which plays the key role in the above motivations , is based on the k@xmath0rolyh@xmath0zy uncertainty relation ( [ kur ] ) and eq.([adeeur ] ) .",
    "the equation ( [ adeeur ] ) is motivated from the energy - time uncertainty relation .",
    "however , the energy - time uncertainty relation may indicate the other natural result .",
    "the k@xmath0rolyh@xmath0zy uncertainty relation ( [ kur ] ) tells us that the time @xmath6 fluctuates with the amplitude @xmath24 . due to the energy - time uncertainty relation , this indicates the existence of energy @xmath25 actually , in @xcite , the above energy has been proposed and supposed to distribut uniformly over the volume @xmath2 .",
    "then the density energy @xmath26 was derived @xcite .",
    "yet , this density energy can not be used to motivate a dark energy model since the corresponding fractional energy density @xmath27 is a decreasing function of @xmath6 . however ,",
    "if we suppose that the energy given in eq.([edeltat ] ) is distributed homogeneously over the minimal detectable cell @xmath28 , then we get the energy density @xmath29 associated with the fluctuation of the minkowski space - time as @xmath30 fortunately , we find that from the above energy density , new dark energy models can be motivated .    based on eq.([aademetricfluc ] ) , in sec.[secaade ] , we propose a new dark energy model characterized by the age of the universe to address the drawbacks in the ade model . in sec.[secanade ] , following the motivation of nade , we motivate a new dark energy model characterized by the conformal age of the universe from eq.([aademetricfluc ] ) .",
    "finally , the summary is given .",
    "based on eq.([aademetricfluc ] ) , following the motivation of the ade model we may propose a new model of dark energy characterized by the age of the universe as @xmath31 where @xmath15 is a constant parameter and @xmath17 is the age of the universe defined in eq.([ageofuniv ] ) .",
    "the corresponding fractional energy density is @xmath32 let us show whether the dark energy ( [ aade ] ) can drive the present accelerated expansion of the universe or not . in the matter - dominated ( md ) epoch , since @xmath33",
    ", then we have @xmath34 . then the fractional energy density ( [ fraced ] ) increases during the md epoch and the dark energy ( [ aade ] ) becomes dominated eventually .",
    "so the tracking behavior of ade during the md epoch does not exist in this model . from eq.([aade ] ) , we have @xmath35 by comparing the equation with the conservation law of the dark energy @xmath36 and using eq.([fraced ] ) , we can get the equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath37 as @xmath38 we can derive from eq.([eosq ] ) that in the dark - energy - dominated ( ded ) epoch the parameter @xmath37 is given by @xmath39 since approximately @xmath40 and @xmath41 . then",
    ", as the increasing of @xmath17 , @xmath37 approaches @xmath42 and the dark energy ( [ aade ] ) mimics a cosmological constant to drive the accelerated expansion .",
    "so , from the above analysis , we know that the dark energy ( [ aade ] ) has at least the reasonable qualitative behavior .",
    "now considering the flat friedmann - robertson - walk ( frw ) universe with the dark energy ( [ aade ] ) and pressureless matter , the corresponding friedmann equation reads @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the energy density of the matter and the corresponding conservation law is @xmath45 then using eqs.([fraced ] ) , ( [ fe ] ) , ( [ aade ] ) and ( [ clmatter ] ) , we find that the evolution of the fractional energy density ( [ fraced ] ) is governed by the two equations @xmath46 where @xmath47 and the subscript @xmath48 denotes the present value of the corresponding parameter . by choosing @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the initial condition @xmath51 , we solve the equations and display the evolution of @xmath52 with respect to @xmath53 in fig.[figaadeomegaq ] .",
    "the result displayed in fig.[figaadeomegaq ] tells us that the dark energy ( [ aade ] ) is negligible in the early universe and becomes dominated in the late , which is consistent with the analysis in the last paragraph .    using eq.([tildehn ] ) , we may rewrite eq.([eosq ] ) as @xmath54 then using the above equation and the numerical solution obtained by solving eqs.([domegaqdatildeh ] ) and ( [ dthda ] ) with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we display the evolution of @xmath37 with respect to @xmath53 in fig.[figaadewa ] .",
    "we also plot the current value of @xmath55 versus @xmath56 with fixed @xmath51 in fig.[figaadewn ] .",
    "we see that @xmath57 as @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the eos parameter is consistent with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe(wmap ) observation @xcite , as @xmath56 is taken to be a number of order ten .",
    "furthermore , let us calculate the shift parameter @xmath59 , which characterizes the position of the first peak of the cosmic microwave background spectrum and is defined as @xcite @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the redshift of decoupling .",
    "the 7-year wmap observations tell us that @xmath62 at @xmath63 confidence level @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we choose @xmath64 .",
    "then , using the numerical solution of eqs.([domegaqdatildeh ] ) and ( [ dthda ] ) with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we obtain the value of @xmath59 to be @xmath65 the 7-year wmap observations tell us @xmath66 at @xmath63 confidence level @xcite .",
    "so the dark energy model ( [ aade ] ) with @xmath50 is consistent with the 7-year wmap observations .     for the dark energy ( [ aade ] ) versus @xmath53 with the initial condition @xmath51 and @xmath50.[figaadeomegaq ] ]     for the dark energy ( [ aade ] ) versus @xmath53 with the initial condition @xmath51 and @xmath50.[figaadewa ] ]     versus the parameter @xmath56 with fixed @xmath51.[figaadewn ] ]     for the dark energy ( [ anade ] ) versus @xmath53 with the initial condition @xmath51 and @xmath50.[figanadeomegaq ] ]     for the dark energy ( [ anade ] ) versus @xmath53 with the initial condition @xmath51 and @xmath50.[figanadewa ] ]",
    "in order to eliminate the inconsistences in the ade model , the authors in ref.@xcite proposed the nade model by replacing the age @xmath17 with the conformal age @xmath22 .",
    "the nade model is very successful in fitting the observation data @xcite .",
    "motivated by this , from eq.([aademetricfluc ] ) we propose a dark energy model characterized by the conformal age of the universe as @xmath67 where @xmath22 is the conformal age of universe defined in eq.([eta ] ) .",
    "the corresponding fractional energy density is @xmath68    let us consider the flat frw universe filled with the dark energy ( [ anade ] ) and the pressureless matter . in the md epoch , the energy conservation equation of the matter , eq.([clmatter ] ) , tells us @xmath69 .",
    "substituting this into eq.([eta ] ) , we have @xmath70 .",
    "then eq.([fracedanade ] ) tells us that in the md epoch , @xmath71 .",
    "then we know that the fractional energy density ( [ fracedanade ] ) increases in the matter - dominated epoch and eventually , the dark energy ( [ anade ] ) becomes dominated . from eqs.([anade ] ) , ( [ eta ] ) , ( [ fracedanade ] ) and the conservation equation @xmath36 , we can easily get the eos parameter as @xmath72 in the ded epoch , since approximately @xmath40 and @xmath73 , from eq.([eosanade ] ) we have @xmath74 so , as the expansion of the universe , @xmath37 approaches @xmath42 and the dark energy ( [ anade ] ) mimics a cosmological constant .",
    "the above analysis makes us believe that qualitatively the dark energy ( [ anade ] ) is a reasonable model .    in order to confirm the qualitative analysis in the last paragraph ,",
    "now let us survey the evolution of the fractional energy density ( [ fracedanade ] ) quantitatively . using eqs.([eta ] ) , ( [ fe ] ) , ( [ anade ] ) , ( [ fracedanade ] ) and ( [ clmatter ] ) , we find that the evolution of @xmath52 is governed by the two equations @xmath75,\\\\",
    "\\label{dthetada }    \\frac{d\\tilde{h}}{da}&=-\\frac{3\\tilde{h}}{2a}\\big[1-\\omega_q+\\frac{4}{9}\\frac{\\omega_q^{7/4}}{a}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tilde{h}}{\\tilde{n}}}\\    \\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "still choosing @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we solve the equations numerically and display the evolution of @xmath52 with respect to @xmath53 in fig.[figanadeomegaq ] .",
    "the result displayed in fig.[figanadeomegaq ] tells us that the dark energy ( [ anade ] ) is negligible in the early universe and becomes dominated in the late , which confirms the qualitative analysis in the last paragraph .    by rewriting eq.([eosanade ] ) as @xmath78 we display the evolution of @xmath37 versus @xmath53 in fig.[figanadewa ] with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . from fig.[figanadewa ] , we know that @xmath37 approaches @xmath42 in the future , which confirms the qualitative analysis . with @xmath49 , we find that the curve representing the current value of @xmath37 defined in eq.([eosanadetildelhn ] ) versus @xmath56 with @xmath51 is just that displayed in fig.[figaadewn ] .",
    "so , as in the last section , from fig.[figaadewn ] we may conclude that the eos parameter of the dark energy ( [ anade ] ) is consistent with the wmap observation @xcite , as @xmath56 is taken to be a number of order ten .",
    "further , with @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we obtain the value of the shift parameter @xmath59 as @xmath79 so the dark energy model ( [ anade ] ) with @xmath50 is in agreement with the 7-year wmap observations ( @xmath66 ) @xcite .",
    "we propose two new models of dark energy based on the k@xmath0rolyh@xmath0zy uncertainty relation ( [ kur ] ) .",
    "the two models are different from the ade @xcite and nade @xcite models .",
    "the ade and nade models are motivated from eq.([ademetricfluc ] ) which is deduced from eq.([kur ] ) by taking the energy of the minimal detectable cell @xmath80 to be @xmath81 , while the two models in this note are motivated from eq.([aademetricfluc ] ) which is obtained by arguing the energy of the cell @xmath80 to be @xmath4 . both eq.([ademetricfluc ] ) and eq.([aademetricfluc ] ) are the natural results of the relation ( [ kur ] ) and the energy - time uncertainty relation .",
    "so , following the motivation of the ade and nade models , we motivate the two models from eq.([aademetricfluc ] ) .",
    "it is well known that there exist implicit inconsistences in the model of ade @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is in order to eliminate the inconsistences of ade that the model of nade is proposed @xcite .",
    "we find that in the two models in the note , the dark energy has the reasonable behavior that the dark energy is negligible in the md epoch and eventually becomes dominated to derive the accelerated expansion , and no inconsistences exist in the two model .",
    "particularly , the model proposed in sec.[secaade ] is characterized by the age of the universe @xmath17 , not the unphysical scale @xmath22 .    by calculating the shift parameter",
    ", we compare the two models with the observational data .",
    "we find the two models with @xmath50 fit the 7-year wmap date well .",
    "we hope that the two models can shed new light on the solving of the dark energy problem .",
