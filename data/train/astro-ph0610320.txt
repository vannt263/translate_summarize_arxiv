    "a soft component which we modeled by a single temperature blackbody . because of the very good low energy _ bepposax _ coverage , we used the average value of input soft photon temperature and column density ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) measured by the bepposax observations . during this period ,",
    "the source has a luminosity of @xmath31 erg s@xmath3 , lower than the one in the soft state , in agreement with the usual ranking of the luminosity in atoll sources ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the electron temperature is now substantially higher than in the soft state , @xmath32 kev , and the comptonization component extends well above @xmath33 kev .",

    "since the spectral parameters in the _ peculiar _ state are similar to those in the soft / high _ bepposax _ state , a possible interpretation of this state is that 4u  163653 was in a similar soft / high state as during the _ bepposax _ observations , but with a new overlapped component at high energies simultaneously present .",

    "the black - body component in the soft states could originate at both the neutron star surface and the surface of an optically - thick accretion disk . in our observations",
    "the two black body components seems to originate from two different parts of the disk , corrisponding to two different temperature .",
    "the comptonization component may arise from a corona above the disk and/or between the disk and the neutron star surface . in the hard states ,",
    "accretion probably assumes the form of a truncated outer accretion disk as previously reported by @xcite for lmxb 4u  1705 - 44 .",
    "the spectral transitions are generally , but not necessarily , coupled with changes in luminosity , indicating they are driven by variability of the accretion rate or change of the geometry of the system as for black hole hard / soft transition at constant luminosity @xcite . for 4u  163653",
    "the accretion rate is lower in the hard state than in the soft state and becames very high in the _ peculiar _ state .",
    "we note this value can be influenced by the steep power law that dominates the energy spectrum at low energies .",
    "the emission is best described by comptonization from a complex electron distribution due to a low temperature ( @xmath70kev ) thermal electron distribution together with non - thermal power - law electrons .",
    "this two - component electron distribution could be explained by the following hypothesis :    * non - thermal electron acceleration regions powered by magnetic reconnections above a disc .",
    "low - energy electrons cool preferentially by coulomb collisions leading to a thermal distribution while the high - energy electrons cool by compton scattering , preserving a non - thermal distribution @xcite .",
    "* the magnetic reconnection above the disc can produce a non - thermal electron distribution , while overheating of the inner disc produces the thermal comptonization @xcite . *",
    "the power - law component could be produced by componization by synchrotron emission in the jet @xcite in our source , this hypothesis is strengthened by radio detection : sydney university molonglo sky survey catalog gives a flux of 7.5 mjy at 843 ghz @xcite .",
    "finally , laurent & titarchuk @xcite suggest the detection of a power - law component at high energy to be a signature of presence black hole in an x - ray binary system .",
    "our data are supporting result on gx  17 + 2 @xcite , clearly showing this criterion proposed to distinguish black hole versus neutron star binaries is inadequate .",
