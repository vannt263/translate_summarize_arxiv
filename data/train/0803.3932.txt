    "then , this best - fit global warm absorber model guides us in identifying the absorption lines seen in the spectrum . in this first step ,",
    "we only consider line identification with transitions , which are actually being predicted to be strong ( i.e. , detectable ) by this photoionization model .",
    "if no line feature at zero velocity was predicted by the model , we allowed for a range of velocities ( up to @xmath15 few thousand km / s - a range of outflow velocities commonly observed in known warm absorbers ) .",
    "that procedure resulted in the line identification reported in table [ tbl7 ] . to give an example of a possible alternative identification",
    ", we compare the strength of the line n  vi at 24.9 (1s-2p , the one identified in table [ tbl7 ] ) with a potential alternative identification , the line n  vii at 24.8  .",
    "the former line is much stronger than the latter : the ratio of optical depth at the core is @xmath176(n  vi)/@xmath176(n  vii ) @xmath177 , for our best - fit global ionization parameter of @xmath178 . at this @xmath179 ,",
    "there is almost 3.5 times more n@xmath180 than n@xmath181 .    assuming the one - absorber model is correct , the predicted strongest lines are the four line candidates presented in table [ tbl7 ] .",
    "however , we find that lines coming from the same ion are at different outflow velocity .",
    "this is a problem at the moment , and opens up a second possibility , which we examined in a second step : ( 2 ) the possibility that we see several different warm absorber components each with a different outflow velocity , and each characterized by a potentially different column density and ionization parameter .",
    "the data quality , a single grating exposure of only 80 ks , does _ not _ allow to fit such a four - component absorber with so many free parameters .",
    "therefore in step ( 2 ) we made the ( simplifying ) assumption that the four identified lines are all at the same velocity .",
    "we therefore assumed that all four lines are at zero velocity or at velocities up to @xmath182 , in particular .",
    "independent of any warm absorber model ( i.e. , any specific @xmath115 and @xmath183 ) , we searched line lists to find any consistent line identifications for the four lines , fixing their wavelengths to the quasar rest - frame ( i.e. , assuming zero velocity ) , or allowing velocities up to @xmath182 . in that case , no line counterparts can be identified .",
    "we therefore continue with solution ( 1 ) , and discuss some implications of this solution . since most warm absorbers are not at rest , in order to identify lines , we allowed for a range of outflow velocities , from @xmath184 .",
    "we find that not all of the absorption line candidates are at the same outflow velocity , but we preliminary identify 3 velocity systems at @xmath185 @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 .",

    "we investigate temporal changes assuming the spectrum is actually dominated by the o  vii and o  viii edges .",
    "later in  [ discu - time ] , we carefully discuss the variability of the spectrum based on a photoionization model , which includes a proper treatment of these features including the uta self - consistently .",
    "first , we split the observation in four ( equally distributed , @xmath190 ks of gti ) time intervals ( 1 - 4 ) and applied a pl @xmath76 2-edges model to each set of data . by fitting this model ( with the edges energy fixed at the values of o  vii and o  viii k - edges , 739 and 871 ev respectively ) , we are able to notice changes ( in time ) around the bound - free features , at @xmath15 0.69 kev for o  vii and 0.81 kev for o  viii in the observed frame which in turn modify the parameter values of the model ( see table [ tbl8 ] ) . to quantify these changes we looked at the parameters of the model at each time interval . due to the low s / n of the data",
    "these measurements have large errors .",
    "nevertheless , one real inconsistency is seen in the depth of the o  viii edge ( @xmath191 ) from time interval ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) : approximately a factor of 3.4 in @xmath191 leads to a change in the count rate level of @xmath192 % , in the vicinity of the edge .",
    "almost no change is seen in @xmath193 , being consistently about the mean best - fit value found before ; @xmath194 .",
    "we caution that the edge model is a too simple representation of the spectrum in the ( @xmath2 ) kev range , where also the utas are located .",
    "therefore , we do not draw any physical implications from it .",
    "we discuss a more physical photoionization model in  [ discu - time ] .",
    "in this section we discuss the physical implications of our measurements , which allow us to draw conclusions about the kinematics of the outflowing gas , ionization state of the warm absorber , and variability of the absorption structure around the oxygen edges seen in the spectrum of .",
    "identification of absorption lines in the x - ray spectra of agn is important because these lines carry a wealth of information on the physical conditions in the ionized gas , and its link to other components of the active nucleus .",
    "we have systematically searched for absorption and emission line features in the x - ray spectrum of , and have identified four absorption line candidates corresponding to transitions in the ions c  vi and n  vi .",
    "these lines , if real , would imply a rather complex velocity field of the absorber , with lines from the same ion indicating different outflow velocities . in particular , it is of our concern the lack of corresponding absorption from the element oxygen  , and can not identify any feature .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite while @xcite report some oxygen absorption features at @xmath195 in the rgs spectrum of ( their table 3 ) , albeit with low significance . ] . in case of solar abundances of the ionized gas ,",
    "oxygen absorption features are expected and have been detected in several agn with warm absorbers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even though few of them with well - measured column densities . on the other hand",
    ", it has also been found that warm absorbers are complex , stratified , multi - component , time - variable , and possibly of non - solar abundances , and the same may well hold for . with these cautious comments in mind ,",
    "we briefly discuss implications of the line candidates we find . ultimately , deeper grating observations are needed to study the absorption line features and their temporal evolution .",
    "independent information on the presence and velocity fields of ionized absorption components comes from a comparison of x - ray with with uv observations .",
    "firstly , in our letg spectrum we identified a candidate gas component outflowing at a velocity @xmath196 @xmath197 , as indicated by the c  vi @xmath16933.736 line .",
    "this is consistent with uv measurements .",
    "the uv spectrum of provides evidence for an absorbing system at an outflow velocity of @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "this component is seen through the o  vi @xmath1691032,1038 and ly@xmath20 lines , observed with the stis on board hst . also ( and reported by the same authors ) , this component is in accordance with the velocity of @xmath199 , reflected by the ly@xmath160 line , observed with fuse .",
    "this is interesting , because it confirms the scenario where uv and x - ray absorber systems could be physically related @xcite .",
    "however , the centroid of our x - ray line candidate is measured with an uncertainty that also allows to relate this x - ray absorption system with the average outflow velocity of @xmath200 reported by @xcite using the ly@xmath20 , n  v  @xmath13 , and c  iv  @xmath14 lines in the ultraviolet ( uv ) band ( with the _ hst - faint object spectrograph _ observation of ) . for the computation of the mass - outflow rate , we assume that the outflowing material in forms a spherical shell ( @xmath201 ) expanding at velocity @xmath196 . using the approximation @xmath202 , we can write : @xmath203 or @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the mean mass per h atom ( equal to @xmath206 ) , @xmath207 is the column density of the material in units of @xmath65 , @xmath208 is the distance of the gas in units of @xmath209 cm , and @xmath210 is the covering factor ( @xmath211 $ ] ) .",
    "using our best - fit @xmath212 , an outflow velocity @xmath213 , at a distance of @xmath214 cm ( distance chosen for illustrative purposes ) we have a mass - loss rate @xmath215 @xmath22 .    in table",

    "our computation of @xmath219 is more in agreement with the value found by these last authors .",
    "the kinematic energy rate carried away by the flow spans @xmath220 .",
    "warm absorbers are known to vary on short and long time scales .",
    "we find indications for variability during the letg observation of in the wavelength range that includes the oxygen absorption edges and the fe uta features .",
    "both , the utas ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and/or the absorption edges could be variable",
    ". mechanisms of variability include changes of the ionization state of the absorber to changes in the ionizing continuum , changes of the internal structure of the absorber , and clouds crossing our line of sight .",
    "in order to find clues on the variability mechanism , we have fit our most successful warm absorber photoionization model ( model @xmath221 ; i.e. , ( pl+bb ) @xmath222 xstar , with @xmath223 ) separately to the four subsets of the total observation ( fig .",
    "[ light1 ] ) .",
    "we have explored the effects of variable column density , ionization parameter , and intensity of the continuum ( black body and powerlaw ) spectral components .",
    "the strongest effect is a change in column density of the ionizing material in epoch ( 3 ) ; formally requiring ( at @xmath224 ) a smaller column density in order to fit successfully that epoch ( fig .",

    "we have used the best - fit model of epoch ( 1 ) and compared it to the data of epoch ( 3 ) . in the comparison , we have fixed all the parameters ( of our model @xmath221 ) to those derived for epoch ( 1 ) , and then inspected the residuals during epoch ( 3 ) .",
    "clear deviations are seen ( figure [ sigma_ratio ] ) , demonstrating independently the presence of spectral changes throughout the observation .",
    "changes in the luminosity would affect the ionization state of the absorber , but the average countrate or mr2251 - 178 does not vary throughout the observation .",
    "taken at face value , a true change in column density would require a change in density and/or thickness of the absorber , and we first briefly comment on this possibility .",
    "assuming the thickness of the absorber has not changed in such a short time , the density of the absorber would need to change by a factor of 3 to account for the change in @xmath183 between periods ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "however , changing the density of the whole extended gas ( or a fraction of the gas by a large amount ) , is not easy in such a short time scale .",
    "re - arrangements of clouds crossing our line - of - sight would have to occur within @xmath15 10 ks , which is very unlikely .",
    "alternatively we may see non - equilibrium ionization effects in the gas , in which the material responds with some time delay in a complicated way to previous variability in the ionizing continuum , which was not within our observation time window .",
    "deeper observations with longer time bases are required to investigate these possibilities further .",
    "the measured ( @xmath3 ) kev flux @xmath51 implies that is in a relatively low state . the soft x - ray luminosity amounts to @xmath52 .",

    ", we find the observation to be consistent with ionized absorbing material in our line of sight , column density @xmath227 , and an ionization parameter of @xmath228 .",
    "the inclusion of an additional thermal component is important because otherwise : ( 1 ) the absorption structure around 18 is not well reproduced , ( 2 ) the ionization state of the gas would be higher , bringing a lot of problems in the identification of the atomic line transition .",
