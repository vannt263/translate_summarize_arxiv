    "for theories of the early universe , the right amount of perturbations must be generated so as to conform with our observations such as cosmic miscrowave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structures ( lss ) @xcite .",
    "one of the well - known observed features is , the power spectrum of these perturbations , which comes from the 2-point correlation function , has to be ( nearly ) scale - invariant @xcite , which will put on non - trivial constraints on theoretical model building . although it is well - known that a single scalar field , which drives the universe into de - sitter like expansion ( inflation @xcite , while the scalar is called inflaton ) , or nonrelativistic matter - like contraction @xcite could easily generate perturbations to meet the requirement , the nature of the scalar is still unclear .",
    "scale - invariant power spectrum may also arise when one modify einstein s gravity at early times . in some cases",
    ", the modified gravity theories could be connected with unmodified general relativity ( gr ) plus a scalar through conformal transformations @xcite , with the latter being viewed as the counterpart in einstein frame of the former . due to the equivalence between the two frames ( jordan and einstein ) ,",
    "the perturbation generated by the couple of counterparts are exactly the same .",
    "thanks to the connection , one can thus reconstruct models of modified gravity from the known evolution of gr plus a scalar models , which can lead to inflation or matter - contraction scenarios .",
    "recently we proposed a way of reconstructing the models with a scalar nonminimally coupled to gravity which could give rise to scale - invariant power spectrum @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will consider another case of modified gravity , namely @xmath0 theories .",
    "actually as we will see later , @xmath0 theories could be one specific but nontrivial form of nonminimal coupling . in @xmath0 theories , there is no need to introduce the unknown scalar , and the universe is driven totally by its gravitational structure .",
    "@xmath0 theories has been used widely as alternatives of inflation , dark matter , dark energy and so on .",
    "see @xcite for comprehensive reviews .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath0 gravity has been pursued by many authors , see @xcite . in their approaches ,",
    "most of them reconstruct @xmath0 theory in jordan frame itself , provided that the cosmic evolution in jordan frame is given . here",
    "we will reconstruct in a different way , namely from their counterpart in einstein frame , which looks like a single scalar field in gr , via conformal transformation .",
    "this kind of reconstruction aims at connecting different evolutions of the universe driven by modified gravity in its jordan and einstein frames .",
    "as is shown in @xcite , in einstein frame there are only two cases which could give rise to ( nearly ) scale - invariant power spectrum , namely inflation and matter - contraction . taking the einstein frame lagrangian as : [ einstein ] l_e~r_e-(_e)^2-v(_e )  ,",
    "where here and after we set the unit such that @xmath3 , and use the metric signature @xmath4 .",
    "a simple and representative solution is the exact solution which is obtained assuming that its equation of state @xmath5 is a constant , namely : [ parametrize ] a_e(t_e)&~&(t_e)^  ,  h_e(t_e)=  , + _ e(t_e)&= &  ,  v(_e)=v_0 e^-_e  where @xmath6 is some energy scale . in this parametrization , we have set @xmath7 for positive @xmath8 meaning an expanding phase , while @xmath9 for negative @xmath8 denoting a contracting phase , and @xmath10 is some constant factor . in inflation case , we have @xmath11 with the slow - roll parameter @xmath12 , then eq .

    "e(t_e)&=&(mt_e )  ,  v(_e)=v_0 e^-_e  , while in matter - contraction case , one has @xmath13 , and thus eq .",

    "e(t_e)&=&(-mt_e )  ,  v(_e)=v_0 e^-_e  .    in this short paper",
    ", we will mainly focus on the jordan frame of the modified gravity theories in order to find which form can be conformally connected to the above two cases , while more complete study for the case of varying @xmath5 ( or @xmath14 ) will be left for the future .",
    "the remaining sections are organized as following : in sec .",
    "ii , we review the main results for the general nonminimal coupling theories that was obtained in our previous paper . in sec .",
    "iii , we focus on @xmath0 theories",
    ". numerical plots of the functional form of @xmath0 as well as the evolution of @xmath1 in terms of cosmic time @xmath2 are presented .",
    "furthermore , we also discussed about the relation of the evolutions of various cosmological variables between the two frames for an arbitrary constant @xmath14 . in sec .",
    "iv we conclude our paper .",
    "first of all , we will briefly review the main results obtained in @xcite .",
    "the action of the nonminimal coupling theory we are considering is : [ actionnmc ] s_nmc = d^4x  , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 can be arbitrary functions of the field @xmath17 in the jordan frame , and @xmath18 is the potential .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath17 is : [ eomnmc ] + 3h_j+^2-(h+2h^2)+=0  , where subscript ",
    "@xmath17 \" indicates @xmath19 and dot denotes derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath20 in the jordan frame , and the friedmann equation is : [ friedmannnmc ] 6h_jf+6h_j^2f = z^2+u  .following the conformal transformation of metrics in jordan and einstein frame , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , the relations of some basic variables between the two frames are summarized as follows : [ relationnmc ] dt_e&=&dt_j  ,  a_e = a_j  ,  h_e=(1 + )  , + _",
    "e&=&d  ,  v(_e)=  .",
    "the equation of motion of the perturbation generated by the action ( [ actionnmc ] ) can be written down as : [ perteomnmc ] u^_r+(k^2-)u_r=0  , where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the conformal - invariant curvature perturbation .",
    "the variable @xmath25 is defined as : q_r[3_f^2 + ]  , where @xmath26 . the prime denotes derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath27 . with the parametrization that @xmath28 , the superhorizon solution of eq .",
    "( [ perteomnmc ] ) can be expressed in the following : [ resultnmc ] u_r&~ & + & ~ & c_1k^-|_-|^-+c_2k^-|_-|^1-  , + r&=&~c_1k^-+c_2k^-|_-|^1 - 2  , where @xmath29 is the bessel function and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are constants .",
    "the power spectrum is defined as _",
    "r(k)|r|^2  .",
    "from the above solution , it is straightforward to see that scale - invariant spectrum @xmath32 can be obtained in two ways : one is @xmath33 , where the time - varying mode becomes decaying while the constant mode dominates the perturbation , which is inflation , and the other is @xmath34 , where the time - varying mode is the growing mode and thus dominates over the constant one , which is matter - contraction .",
    "in fact , from the relation ( [ relationnmc ] ) one can express @xmath25 as : q_r~f_e  , and since we have assumed constant @xmath5 and @xmath14 , the condition of getting scale - invariant power - spectrum can be written as @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "we can reconstruct the universe evolution once we assume the evolution of @xmath37 in terms of @xmath20 . in our previous paper @xcite",
    ", we assumed that @xmath38^{\\omega}$ ] , then from the relation ( [ relationnmc ] ) we have : [ te2tji1 ] t_e=\\ {    l ( ) ^+1  for  -1  , +   + _ 0t^_j(|t_j )  for  = -1  , +    .",
    "where the @xmath7 sign in @xmath39 means @xmath40 , and in the jordan frame the universe is expanding , while the @xmath9 sign means @xmath41 , and in the jordan frame the universe is contracting . here",
    "we define @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the planck time . substituting it into eqs .",
    "( [ parametrizeinf ] ) and ( [ parametrizemb ] ) respectively , one can get the evolution of variables such as @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in terms of @xmath20 as ( for @xmath47 only ) : a_j(t_j)&~&(t_j)^  ,  h_j=  , + w_j&=&-1 +  , where @xmath48 for the case corresponding to inflation , while @xmath49 for the case corresponding to matter - contraction , respectively .",
    "moreover , from relation ( [ relationnmc ] ) one can also find the evolution of field variables , and thus determine the form of functions @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 in the lagrangian .",
    "in fact , taking the ansatz of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ eomnmc ] ) and ( [ friedmannnmc ] ) , we found the relation : [ relationfieldnmc ] f()=f_0 ^ 2z+2  , q=2(z+1)(1- )  , and the equation of state @xmath46 can be given by : w_j=  .    from above we can see that , once the functional form of @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath18 in action ( [ actionnmc ] ) is given by ( [ relationfieldnmc ] ) , one could obtain scale - invariant power spectrum . rather than being fixed to be inflation or matter - contraction only , the evolution of the universe in the jordan frame has more freedom .",
    "this is because in the jordan frame , the nonminimal coupling action ( [ actionnmc ] ) has more degrees of freedom than that in the einstein frame and is more dependent on the form of the action .",
    "however , as we will see below , it is not the case in @xmath0 theory . in @xmath0 theory",
    ", there will be less degree of freedom than nonminimal coupling theory and the form of @xmath0 will be more fixed . following similar steps",
    ", we will find the appropriate @xmath0 theory , which can correspond to inflation or matter - contraction scenarios in its einstein frame and thus , give rise to scale - invariant power spectrum .",
    "now we turn on to study the reconstruction of @xmath0 modified gravity theories .",
    "the action of @xmath0 modified gravity theory is : [ actionfr ] s_f(r)=d^4xf(r )  , where @xmath0 can be arbitrary function of the ricci scalar @xmath1 .",
    "varying the action ( [ actionfr ] ) with respect to the metric @xmath52 we can get the equation of motion : [ eomfr ] -f_,;+g_f+fr_-g_f=0  , where we defined the function @xmath53 .",
    "the left part of the above equation can also be viewed as the  effective \" stress energy tensor @xmath54 of @xmath0 modified gravity , which satisfies the continuity equation , @xmath55 . moreover ,",
    "the  @xmath56 \" and  @xmath57 \" components of eq .",
    "( [ eomfr ] ) are just friedmann equations , which are 3h^2f=(f+3f+3hf )  ,  -2h f = f - hf  , respectively .    same as nonminimal coupling theory , @xmath0 theories with action ( [ actionfr ] ) can also be connected with ( [ einstein ] ) as its counterpart in the einstein frame , via the conformal transformation @xmath21 with @xmath58 . to see this , one can rewrite the action ( [ actionfr ] ) in the form of scalar - tensor theory , namely as : [ actionst ] s_st = d^4x  where the potential @xmath59 can be identified as @xmath60",
    ". the relations of the basic variables between the two frames are summarized as follows : [ relationfr ] dt_e&=&dt_j  ,  a_e = a_j  ,  h_e=(1 + )  , + _ e&= &  ,  v(_e)=  .    from the transformed action ( [ actionst ] )",
    "we can see that , the @xmath0 action is actually the specific form of the general nonminimal coupling action ( [ actionnmc ] ) with @xmath61 , as long as we identify @xmath15 with @xmath62 , and @xmath18 with @xmath59 , which is easy provided that the inverse function of @xmath15 exists .",
    "moreover , since @xmath16 as well as the kinetic term of ( [ actionnmc ] ) vanishes , there are less degrees of freedom in @xmath0 than in nonminimal coupling theories , and the conformal factor @xmath37 , which determines the cosmic evolution in jordan frame , can be totally fixed by the field @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , when there is one kind of evolution in einstein frame , there is only one kind of evolution in jordan frame .",
    "this gives less possibilities for @xmath0 theories to get scale - invariant power spectrum than those for nonminimal coupling theories .",
    "one can also check from the perturbation theory of @xmath0 that what conditions should be met when one requires a scale - invariant power spectrum . working in the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) formalism @xcite , one can obtain the perturbed action of @xmath0 up to the second order as : [ pertactionfr ] s^(2)=dd^3xa_j^2 q_r  , where @xmath24 is the conformal - invariant curvature perturbation , and q_r  with @xmath64 and the prime denotes derivative with respect to the conformal time @xmath65 . varying ( [ pertactionfr ] ) with respect to @xmath24 , one can straightforwardly write down the equation of motion for the perturbation as : [ perteomfr ] u^_r+(k^2-)u_r=0  , through the redefined variables @xmath23 .    from the above analysis , we can directly conclude that scale - invariant spectrum can be obtained in two ways , namely @xmath66 which corresponds to inflation , or @xmath67 which corresponds to matter - contraction .",
    "moreover , from the relation ( [ relationfr ] ) one can express @xmath25 as @xmath68 , the same as that in nonminimal coupling theories . here",
    "we can see again that @xmath0 theories are nothing but specific case of nonminimal coupling theories .",
    "in our case where constant @xmath5 and @xmath14 have been assumed , the condition of getting scale - invariant power - spectrum can be written as @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "first of all , from relations ( [ relationfr ] ) as well as the evolution of @xmath69 in the einstein frame ( [ parametrize ] ) , we can obtain the evolution of the conformal factor @xmath37 in terms of @xmath8 , which is = ( ) ^  ,  |_e|1  , where @xmath70 .",
    "since the universe in einstein frame is expanding , we set @xmath8 and @xmath71 to be positive . , @xmath20 monotonically increases , although its value can be either positive or negative .",
    "this is an arbitrary choice , only indicating the arrow of time , and one can surely assume that time goes in an opposite direction , which is only trivially dual to the current case by the transformation @xmath72 . ]",
    "since @xmath73 , one could easily get @xmath20 as : t_j=()^  , or equivalently , = ( ) ^  ,",
    "t_j^  .note that since @xmath48 , @xmath20 and @xmath74",
    ". then we have : [ omegatj ] ( t_j)=()^  .    with eqs .",
    "( [ parametrizeinf ] ) , ( [ relationfr ] ) and ( [ omegatj ] ) in hand , we can obtain the evolution of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in the jordan frame , in terms of @xmath20 .",
    "the results are : [ evolutioninf ] a_j(t_j)&~&()^  , + h_j(t_j)&= &  , + w_j&= &  .    from this result",
    "we can see that , since @xmath48 as we considered , the index of @xmath44 in terms of @xmath20 ( namely @xmath75 , if we define @xmath76 to be the slow - roll parameter in the jordan frame ) is less than zero , and @xmath77 will be increasing as @xmath20 increases .",
    "this indicates that it is an expanding universe , driven by @xmath0 modified gravity theory , which is equivalent to the so - called  super - inflation \" @xcite ( or phantom - inflation @xcite ) scenario in gr when transformed to the einstein frame .",
    "one can also look into the equation of state @xmath46 of the universe , which is very much close to @xmath78 up to order of slow - roll parameter , which means that the universe in the jordan frame is also near de sitter , so different from the general nonminimal coupling theory , inflation in the einstein frame can only refer to inflation in the jordan frame in @xmath0 modified gravity theory .",

    "<S> following our previous work in [ jcap * 1206 * , 041 ( 2012 ) @xcite ] , in this paper , we continue our study of reconstructing @xmath0 modified gravity models that can be connected to a single scalar field in general relativity via conformal transformation , which lead to scale - invariant power spectrum in the early universe . with @xmath0 modified gravity , one does not need to introduce extra scalar , the nature of which are to be explained . different from general nonminimal coupling theory , the behavior of the @xmath0 theory has been fixed by its counterpart in einstein frame , and thus have one to one correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> numerical plots of the functional form of @xmath0 as well as the evolution of @xmath1 in terms of cosmic time @xmath2 are also presented . </S>"
