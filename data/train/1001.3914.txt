    "the josephson effect@xcite is one of the most celebrated manifestation of many body correlations in condensed matter physics : a cooper pair current@xcite between two bulk superconductors separated by an intermediate region or arbitrary nature can flow even in the absence of an applied bias . over the last few decades , the josephson effect has become a very active field of theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite investigation in the context of mesoscopic devices , devices which are small enough that electron transport occurs in a phase coherent manner . because the tunneling of cooper pairs through the junction is greatly affected by the physical properties of the segment between superconducting electrodes , the study of the josephson current provides a new way to investigate the electronic properties of the medium . in early days",
    ", thin layers of insulators and metals were used to form the josephson junction.@xcite advance in nanofabrication technology can now enable one to make the middle segment small enough to be considered as a quantum dot ( qd ) , a zero dimensional entity bridging the two superconductors.@xcite furthermore , even a real ( or artificial ) molecule can be inserted between two closely positioned superconducting leads to form a molecular josephson junction ( mjj).@xcite quantum dots connected to normal metal leads are known to exhibit the coulomb blockade phenomenon due to their large charging energies.@xcite interestingly , at low enough temperatures , when an odd number of electrons occupy the qd , one can reach the kondo regime.@xcite yet the leads can be chosen to be superconductors which lead to a competition between kondo physics and superconductivity.@xcite the purpose of the present work is precisely to study the josephson effect through a multilevel quantum dot in this context , with applications to molecular spintronics .    indeed , the qd - jj have received a great theoretical and experimental attention because they can exhibit an interesting competition between two many - body correlations : the superconductivity and the kondo effect . due to its small size",
    ", the qd has a large coulomb charging energy .",
    "the kondo effect then emerges for such a small qd coupled strongly to the leads when the qd has a localized magnetic moment , that is , nonzero total spin of electrons in it . at temperatures below the so - called kondo temperature @xmath1,@xcite the conduction electrons in the leads screen the localized moment through multiple cotunneling spin - flip processes , forming a spin - singlet ground state , and induces a resonance level at the fermi energy , which increases the linear conductance up to the unitary - limit value ( @xmath2 ) that is otherwise completely suppressed due to the strong coulomb repulsion .",
    "if the leads consist of @xmath3-wave superconductors , the conduction electrons form spin - singlet cooper pairs incapable of flipping the qd spin .",
    "it has been known,@xcite and recently probed,@xcite that in the weak dot - lead coupling limit the large coulomb repulsion only allows the electrons in a cooper pair to tunnel one by one via virtual processes in which the spin ordering of the pair is reversed , leading to a @xmath0 junction , and that the localized moment remains unscreened . in the opposite limit where the kondo temperature exceeds the superconducting gap @xmath4 , however , the induced kondo resonance level restores the 0 junction state of the supercurrent.@xcite as a result , one can drive a phase transition between spin singlet ( 0 junction ) and doublet ( @xmath0 junction ) states by changing the relative strengths of @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "current issues about electronic transport through a qd or a molecule go beyond the spin - degenerate single - level model and take into account multi - level structures and/or possible magnetic interactions .",
    "for example , the theoretical prediction that the two - level quantum dots ( tlqds ) with spin exchange interaction coupled to normal - metal leads can experience a quantum phase transition , specifically the singlet - triplet transition,@xcite was recently confirmed by two independent experiments.@xcite the transition was observed to accompany a drastic change in the transport mechanism , and it was also found that the spin exchange coupling between electrons could suppress the kondo correlation completely or alter its physical nature by changing the screening mechanism .",
    "the influence of such a magnetic interaction on the josephson current was also studied for a mjj where the molecule is modeled by a single - level qd having spin exchange coupling@xcite between spins of qd electron and a metal ion.@xcite it was predicted that the state of the supercurrent can be switched between 0 and @xmath0 junctions by tuning the magnetic interaction . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical calculations@xcite and experiments@xcite have shown that the josephson junction made of a multi - level quantum dot in the weak - coupling limit can behave as a @xmath0 junction even when the dot is nonmagnetic without a localized spin and vice versa .",
    "the studies found out the significant roles of ( 1 ) the off - diagonal cooper pair tunneling process@xcite in which two electrons in the pair are transferred via different orbitals in the qd and ( 2 ) the parity of the qd orbital wave functions@xcite that determine the relative sign of the dot - lead couplings .",
    "in this paper we study the electronic transport through a josephson junction having in it a tlqd with the spin exchange interaction between electrons in two orbital levels .",
    "here we focus on the regime where the doubly - occupied qd experiences the singlet - triplet transition due to the spin exchange coupling that is tunable by the gate voltage .",
    "the physical properties of the ground state and the supercurrent - phase relation ( spr ) through the junction are examined as the strengths of the superconductivity and the spin exchange coupling are varied . in order to study both of the weak- and strong - coupling limits we exploit the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method which can take into account the coulomb interaction in a nonperturbative way . in additions ,",
    "the physical understanding of the numerical outcome is supplemented by the analytical analysis such as fourth - order perturbation theory and scaling theory .",
    "our main findings are summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the sign of the supercurrent is determined by the competition between diagonal and off - diagonal tunneling processes whose strength and sign can be controlled by the parity of the orbital wave functions and the spin correlation present in the dot .",
    "( 2 ) the origin and physical property of the tlqd - jj can be explained in terms of the competition between the superconductivity and the kondo correlation found from the normal - lead counterpart of the system .",
    "for example , the two - stage kondo effect leads to 0-@xmath0 - 0 or @xmath0 - 0-@xmath0 double transitions with the exchange coupling or the superconducting gap .",
    "( 3 ) when the superconducting phase difference between two leads is maximal , the existing kondo correlation is greatly affected .",
    "interestingly , we observed that a kondo - assisted @xmath0-junction can arise if some conditions are met .",

    "especially , at the maximally twisted condition ( @xmath299 ) , the kondo correlation is completely suppressed in the case i and the kondo - assisted @xmath0-junction is induced in the case ii . knowing that the @xmath0-junction in most of cases is usually weak due to its perturbative origin , the latter mechanism opens a way to have a strong @xmath0-junction . in the light of quantum computational unit which is free of any magnetic control ,",
    "this @xmath0-junction is more promising because the state of the junction can be controlled by electric manipulation : the spin exchange coupling can be tuned by the gate voltage .",
    "we expect that our theoretical prediction about phase diagrams and sprs in tlqd - jjs can be explored in experiment by using state - of - art fabrication techniques . a recent experiment@xcite measured electronic transport through c@xmath353-molecular junctions and detected the singlet - triplet transition and the accompanying kondo effects which are consistent with existing theories .",
    "the same experiment group has extended their study to superconducting case@xcite where the al bars are attached on top of au leads coupled to c@xmath353 and the superconductivity is induced in au leads by the proximity effect .",
    "the josephson effect predicted in our paper can be then investigated by forming a squid,@xcite one of which arms contains the molecular junction . as implemented in roch _",
    "et al._,@xcite the spin exchange coupling can be then controlled by an externally applied gate voltage . or , the superconducting gap can be tuned by applying a magnetic field as long as it does not suppress the kondo effect . in this way",
    "the switching between 0 and @xmath0 states with respect to the tuning of @xmath7 and/or @xmath4 predicted in our calculations could be confirmed in experiment . even without using the squid geometry ,",
    "our theory could be tested by measuring a critical current through the junction , which should exhibit nontrivial dependence on the spin exchange coupling as discussed above .",
