    "the inverse source scattering problems , an important research subject in inverse scattering theory , are to determine the unknown sources that generate prescribed radiated wave pattens @xcite .",
    "these problems are largely motivated by applications in medical imaging @xcite .",
    "a typical example is to use electric or magnetic measurements on the surface of the human body , such as head , to infer the source currents inside the body , such as the brain , that produce the measured data .",
    "mathematically , the inverse source scattering problems have been widely examined for acoustic and electromagnetic waves by many researchers @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is known that the inverse source problem does not have a unique solution at a fixed frequency due to the existence of non - radiating sources @xcite ; it is ill - posed as small variations in the measured data can lead to huge errors in the reconstructions @xcite .",
    "although the deterministic counterparts have been well studied , little is known for the stochastic inverse problems due to uncertainties , which are widely introduced to the models for two common reasons : randomness may directly appear in the studied systems @xcite and incomplete knowledge of the systems must be modeled by uncertainties @xcite . a uniqueness result may be found in @xcite , where it showed that the auto - correlation function of the random source was uniquely determined everywhere outside the source region by the auto - correlation function of the radiated field .",
    "recently , one - dimensional stochastic inverse source problems have been considered in @xcite , where the governing equations are stochastic ordinary differential equations . utilizing the green functions ,",
    "the authors have presented the first approach in @xcite for solving the inverse random source scattering problem in higher dimensions , where the stochastic partial differential equations are considered .    in this paper , we study both the direct and inverse random source scattering problems for elastic waves . given the source , the direct problem is to determine the displacement of the random wave field .",
    "the inverse problem is to reconstruct the mean and variance of the random source from the boundary measurement of the wave field .",
    "recently , the elastic wave scattering problems have received ever increasing attention for their significant applications in many scientific areas such as geophysics and seismology @xcite .",
    "for example , they have played an important role in the problem for elastic pulse transmission and reflection through the earth when investigating earthquakes and determining their focus , which is exactly the motivation of this work .",
    "the random source is assumed to be driven by a white noise , which can be thought as the derivative of a brownian sheet or a multi - parameter brownian motion .",
    "the goal is to determine the mean and variance of the random source function by using the same statistics of the displacement of the wave field , which are measured on a boundary enclosing the compactly supported source at multiple frequencies . by constructing a sequence of regular processes approximating the rough white noise ,",
    "we show that there exists a unique mild solution to the stochastic direct scattering problem . by studying the expectation and variance of the solution ,",
    "we deduce fredholm integral equations of the first kind for the inverse problem .",
    "it is known that fredholm integral equations of the first kind are severely ill - posed , which can be clearly seen from the distribution of singular values for our integral equations .",
    "it is particularly true for the integral equations of reconstructing the variance .",
    "we present well conditioned integral equations via linear combination of the original equations .",
    "we propose a regularized kaczmarz method to solve the resulting linear system of algebraic equations .",
    "this method is consistent with our multiple frequency data and requires solving a relatively small scale system at each iteration .",
    "numerical experiments show that the proposed approach is effective to solve the problem .",
    "this work is a nontrivial extension of the method proposed in @xcite for the inverse random source scattering problem of the stochastic helmholtz equation , to solve the inverse random source scattering problem of the stochastic navier equation .",
    "clearly , the elastic wave equation is more challenging due to the coexistence of compressional waves and shear waves that propagate at different speeds .",
    "the green function is more complicated and has higher singularity for the navier equation than that of the helmholtz equation does .",
    "hence more sophisticated analysis is required .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the stochastic navier equation for elastic waves and discuss the solutions of the deterministic and stochastic direct problems .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the inverse problem , where fredholm integral equations are deduced and the regularized kaczmarz method is proposed to reconstruct the mean and the variance .",
    "numerical experiments are presented in section 4 to illustrate the performance of the proposed method .",
    "the paper is concluded with general remarks in section 5 .",
