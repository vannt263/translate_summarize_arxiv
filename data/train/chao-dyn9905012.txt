    "this work is an attempt to apply the techniques of symbolic dynamics in quantum mechanics .",
    "the ultimate goal of this kind of investigations is to rewrite the equations of quantum mechanics in terms of adequate symbols for a given ( chaotic ) problem .",
    "symbolic dynamics requires a partition of phase space in various regions .",
    "we are thus faced with the problem of defining properly the quantum analogues to bounded regions of phase space .",
    "the essential difficulties for doing this are the limitations imposed by the uncertainty principle .",
    "strictly speaking , quantum mechanics is not only in contradiction with the notion of a phase space point but also with that of a finite subset of phase space .    in a previous paper",
    "@xcite a symbolic decomposition along these lines was studied , but no special constructions were necessary because the invariant manifolds were aligned with the coordinate axes , thus turning the elements of the generating partition into simple projectors . here",
    "we generalize the method of @xcite by constructing certain objects ( we call them _ quantum rectangles _ ) which are the quantum equivalents to the classical elements of a generating partition .",
    "then we investigate their properties and different possibilities for their construction .",
    "the quantum rectangles behave approximately as projectors over the corresponding classical regions except from diffraction effects which are characteristic of quantum phenomena .",
    "once the quantum rectangles have been defined , it is straightforward to construct a quantum generating partition . in perfect analogy with the classical case",

    "eventually , we obtain an _ exact _ trace formula having the same structure as gutzwiller s .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we argue that the quantum analogue of a finite region of phase space can be constructed in a natural way by simply quantizing the characteristic function of that region . in section iii",
    "we show that in the semiclassical limit the quantized regions display properties consistent with the classical ones .",
    "section iv describes the application of the quantum generating partition to decompose the propagator .",

    "these regions are arbitrary but eventually they will become the elements of a partition of the phase space .    to establish the connection with quantum mechanics we make use of a phase space representation ,",
    "that is , a basis @xmath5 for operators acting on the hilbert space @xmath6 of dimension @xmath7 ( the @xmath8 and @xmath9 representations on the torus are discrete , and mutually related through a discrete fourier transform @xcite ) .",

    "it may well happen that some of the intersections of eq .",

    "starting from the quantizations of the regions of the classical basic partition , we define the quantum refinement in two steps .",

    "the quantum propagation is also a _ shift _ : @xmath85 even though the quantum rectangles do nt have zero  intersection \" , in the semiclassical limit , the product of two elements of the partition tends to the null operator , except from possible singularities due to border effects .",
    "last , when @xmath31 and @xmath86 fixed , the quantum rectangles tend to the classical ones .",
    "the precise meaning of this limit , and the way it is achieved were discussed in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] .",
    "the key property of the quantum partition we have constructed is the symbolic decomposition of the traces of the propagator .",
    "consider the discrete path sum for the trace of a power of the propagator in the coherent state representation @xmath87 where the sum runs over all the _ closed _",
    "paths @xmath88 , which are discrete both in time and in the coordinates ( we recall that @xmath89 moves on the discrete @xmath8-@xmath9 grid ) .",
    "semiclassically the trace of @xmath90 will be dominated by the periodic trajectories ( of period @xmath47 ) of the classical map @xmath63 and their neighboring paths .",
    "symbolic dynamics allows for classifying not only the trajectories but also the paths according to their symbolic history .",
    "so , one has a natural way of partitioning the space of paths into disjoints subsets , each one characterized by a symbol @xmath91 of length @xmath47 and containing the periodic trajectory @xmath92 .",
    "but this mechanism of path grouping is automatically implemented by the quantum projectors : @xmath93 the @xmath57 s are the quantum regions associated to the coherent representation and now the sum runs over the sequence labels @xmath94 .",
    "( [ pathrec ] ) is completely equivalent to ( [ pathcoh ] ) , the difference being just the grouping of closed paths into families sharing the same symbolic code @xmath91 .",
    "each one of these families contributes to a partial trace @xmath95 .",
    "analogous results are obtained in the kirkwood case .",
    "in fact , starting from a path sum in the kirkwood representation , @xmath96 one arrives at the same result of eq .",
    "( [ pathrec ] ) but with the kirkwood rectangles instead of the coherent ones . using the cyclic property , the partial traces of ( [ pathrec ] ) ( or the kirkwood counterparts ) can be rewritten in terms of the refined rectangles of eq .",

    "stable and unstable rectangles are related by the unitary transformation ( [ quanshift ] ) , ensuring that @xmath103 does not depend on the particular choice of @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , the trace of each symbolic piece is cyclically invariant [ as is obvious from ( [ pathrec ] ) ] and therefore the decompositions into invariant cycles in one - to - one correspondence with periodic orbits of the map .",
    "the refined rectangle @xmath104 has as classical limit the characteristic function of the classical region @xmath105 .",
    "thus , its role in ( [ partial ] ) consists essentially in cutting the matrix @xmath106 into pieces .",
    "the kirkwood rectangles act onto the kirkwood matrix @xmath107 : @xmath108 the coherent rectangles perform a similar action but on the operator symbol @xmath109 : @xmath110 in both cases the semiclassical partial trace is obtained by summing over that piece of the matrix which corresponds to the classical rectangle .",
    "thus each symbolic piece captures the local structure of the propagator in the vicinity of a periodic point labeled bu @xmath91 and by stationary phase yields the gutzwiller - tabor contribution of the corresponding periodic orbit . forbidden symbols lead to semiclassically small contributions@xcite .",
    "the symbolic decomposition we have presented has the nice feature of reducing the problem of understanding the asymptotic limit of the traces of the propagator to the analysis of individual  partial \" traces @xmath111 , each one characterized by a code given by the symbolic dynamics , and ruled by a periodic point .",
    "the simplest system in which the quantum partitions can be applied to decompose the propagators is perhaps the baker s",
    "map @xcite .",
    "its generating partition consists in two rectangles , which , due to the fact that the expanding and contracting directions are parallel to the coordinate axes , are solely defined by conditions on @xmath8 . as a consequence , the quantum rectangles for the baker s reduce _ exactly _ to projectors on subspaces @xcite .",
    "this greatly simplifies the symbolic analysis of the quantum baker s , allowing very detailed studies of its partial traces @xcite .    however , the baker s is too special for illustrating the properties of the rectangles : many of them are satisfied trivially .",
    "moreover , the partial traces of the baker s display some unpleasant anomalies that difficult the semiclassical analyses @xcite .    still simple enough",
    ", the arnold s cat map @xmath63 @xcite is more appropriate for a general illustration of the method and can be investigated numerically .",
    "the classical cat map is defined by @xmath112 this is a linear , hyperbolic , and continuous map of the torus . as its invariant manifolds are not aligned with the coordinate axes , the rectangles of the generating partition @xcite ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) are not projectors .",
    "this makes the cat map non - trivial for our purposes .    before proceeding ,",
    "we must point out that the quantum cat map presents one very particular feature : gutwiller s semiclassical formula gives the exact traces @xcite .",
    "for this reason the cat map is not suitable for studying corrections to the trace formula . in principle",
    ", any decomposition into partial traces will introduce errors which , however , will cancel out when added up to produce the whole trace .",
    "thus this model may be useful as a test of the mechanisms that lead to such cancellation .",
    "let s now go to the details of the numerical example .",

    "[ fig5 ] ) . in the semiclassical limit",
    "we can replace the sum by an integration and do the latter using the stationary phase method . in this approximation",
    "we must only take into account the contributions of the _ critical points _",
    "the most important contribution comes from the the periodic orbit ( critical point of the first kind ) and its neighborhood .",

    "thus the problem of understanding the semiclassical limit of the traces of a propagator is reduced to the analysis of partial traces coded by the symbolic dynamics .",
    "the objects we have constructed tend asymptotically to their classical counterparts and respond to same dynamics . in this way",
    ", one can verify step by step many manipulations that up to now could only be done at a semiclassical level .    before concluding we would like to emphasize that the construction presented here is by no means restricted to phase space regions that are markov partitions .",
    "any region of phase space selected for `` attention '' can be handled in the same way and its quantum properties explored .",
