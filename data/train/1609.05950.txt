    "this expectation is based on the standard heuristic predicting primes in increasing sequences of integers ( without any local obstructions ) .",
    "namely , since the series @xmath140 is diverging , for any @xmath46 with @xmath141 there are probably infinitely many positive integers @xmath13 for which @xmath139 is prime ( we need only one such @xmath13 ) .",

    "for example , one can conjecture that if @xmath209 then we have @xmath210 in a wide range of parameters @xmath81 and @xmath13 .",
    "it is also possible that there is an asymptotic formula for @xmath143 , but it has to take into account some local conditions of the same type which are used for @xmath211 in section  [ sec : num ] .",

    "for example , our computation seems to point that @xmath221 and @xmath222 .",
    "it is also natural to forbid zero digits and denote by @xmath223 the number of prime generating sequences @xmath224 of length @xmath13 that consist only of non - zero digits ( in particular the definition is only interesting for @xmath26 ) .",

    "@xmath231 is @xmath232 however for @xmath14 only @xmath227 out @xmath2 values are admissible .",
    "hence , we are led to the approximate recursive relation @xmath233 with the inital value @xmath234 , which in turn leads us to the approximation @xmath235 where the coefficient @xmath236 depends on the actual values of @xmath223 for small values of @xmath13 . using the stirling formula in the very crude form @xmath237 , we rewrite this as @xmath238 for some factor @xmath236 depending only on @xmath2 .",
    "we remark that it is hard to get any explicit formula for @xmath236 , which depends on the initial behaviour of the sequence @xmath223 .",
    "in particular we see that  , ignoring the presence of the factor @xmath236 , suggests that @xmath239 ( and thus @xmath240 ) for @xmath241 where @xmath242    quite naturally , the approximation   is better when @xmath13 is bigger .",

    "certainly , using the precise values of @xmath264 instead of the stirling formula can also produce to a more precise numerical prediction of @xmath243 .",
    "for example , we always have @xmath265 which leads to slight overestimation of @xmath266 in  .",
