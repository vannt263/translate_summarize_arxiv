    "interference plays a crucial role for both quantum physics and classical wave theories . in quantum optics",
    "quantum interferences and superimposed electromagnetic field components occur simultaneously .",
    "therefore , a proper analysis and determination of the character of interference patterns is indispensable for separating classical wave phenomena from quantum effects .",
    "as photons reflect the particle nature of the electromagnetic field , their generation and detection are of fundamental interest  @xcite . in the low photon number regime , detectors are often based on avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) in the geiger mode .",
    "apds produce a `` click '' for any number of absorbed photons and remain silent otherwise , _",
    "i.e. _ `` no - click '' .",
    "the incident light field can be split into fields with equal intensities , each being measured with an apd , to extract information beyond the binary one .",
    "realizations are time- and spatial - multiplexed detectors and equally illuminated arrays of apds ; _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite for recent experiments . in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] , two spatial - multiplexing schemes  labeled with `` 1 '' and `` 2 ''  are considered .",
    "click counting devices have been applied in quantum metrology  @xcite , or for the determination of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "recently , weak - field homodyning with multiplexing detectors has been implemented to probe quantum features of light  @xcite .",
    "the click counting statistics @xmath0 for a measurement with @xmath1 apds is of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of clicks , @xmath1 the number of apds , and @xmath4 the normal ordering prescription  @xcite .",
    "this quantum version of a binomial statistics is described by the operator @xmath5{:}$ ] , whose expectation value is the probability to record a click with a single apd . herein @xmath6 is the photon number operator , @xmath7 the quantum efficiency , and @xmath8 the dark count rate of each apd .",
    "quantum properties , _",
    "e.g. _ sub - binomial light , can be verified with such detection schemes  @xcite . moreover , higher order correlations , nonlinear absorption processes , multi - time correlations , and state engineering protocols have been investigated for these click counters  @xcite .    in the high intensity regime , _",
    "i.e. _ a few - photon approximation is not valid , the wave nature of the electromagnetic field is often studied by balanced homodyne detection ( bhd ) which is based on the photoelectric detection theory  @xcite . a signal ( si )",
    "is mixed on a beam splitter with a much stronger local oscillator ( lo ) while controlling the relative phase .",
    "interferometric measurements , such as bhd , have been used to verify phase dependent nonclassical phenomena  @xcite . in this scenario",
    ", one would typically not apply single - photon counters because the total intensity of lo and si is considered to exceed the capabilities of click detection . instead",
    ", the outputs fields are measured with a detector which produces an electric current being proportional to the intensity of the incident light field .",
    "applications have been established in quantum metrology  @xcite and weak lo homodyning  @xcite .",
    "a nonclassical light field may be characterized by the non - existence a positive semi - definite glauber - sudarshan @xmath9  representation  @xcite .",
    "moment based criteria in terms of field quadratures have been derived to verify such quantum correlations using bhd  @xcite .",
    "nonclassical light fields characterized in such a form , such as squeezed states , serve as a fundamental resource in applications which require a superior phase determination , for example , for gravitational wave detectors  @xcite . in order to verify other correlations , _",
    "e.g. _ , entanglement , it is indispensable to perform a careful detector analysis  @xcite .",
    "a phase sensitive detection theory does not exist for click counting devices , so that phase sensitive effects are nonaccessible in this regime .    in the present contribution",
    "we formulate a bhd - type phase resolving click counting theory , which unifies the detection of the particle and the wave nature of quantum radiation fields .",
    "this yields a new observable  a nonlinear quadrature operator  as the key element of our approach .",
    "we provide a hierarchy of nonclassicality criteria to uncover phase sensitive quantum effects using on - off detector systems .",
    "direct sampling formulas are given which allow to implement our theory in experiments .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : setup ] we describe the bhd setup using click counting devices .",
    "the si field and the lo are combined on a 50:50 beam splitter .",
    "we assume that the lo and the si are single mode fields with a perfect overlap . for the time being , we also say that the lo is in a perfect coherent state given by the coherent amplitude @xmath10 .",
    "the output beams are individually detected with a system of on - off detectors , which yields a joint click counting statistics @xmath11  @xcite . for simplicity , we assume that both detector systems , 1 and 2 , have identical characteristics , _",
    "i.e. _ , number of apds @xmath12 , quantum efficiencies @xmath13 , and dark count rates @xmath14 .",
    "finally , the difference count rate @xmath15 can be obtained as @xmath16 this difference click counting statistics ",
    "depending on the phase of the lo , @xmath17  is shown for a coherent si state @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig : clickstatistics ] .",
    "note that a low intensity approximation with photoelectric detectors , having a poissonian form of statistics , is impossible in this case since the mean number of photons from si and lo is in the same order as the number of diodes  @xcite .",
    "in general , we will refer to a high intensity if the total intensity of lo and si exceeds the total number of apds , @xmath19 . in this high intensity regime ,",
    "the click counting statistics   is valid even if the probability to have multiple photons at one detector significantly differs from zero .",
    "now , the question arises how to infer quantum properties from this measurement .",
    "since moment - based criteria turn out to be a fruitful approach , we may initially define a nonlinear quadrature operator @xmath20 through @xmath21 where @xmath22{:}$ ] describe the first(second ) detector , respectively .",
    "normally ordered powers of the operator @xmath20 will be used later to uncover quantum effects . using the beam splitter transform , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we rewrite eq .   for the coherent lo , @xmath10 , as @xmath25\\!\\ !",

    "alternatively , a first order taylor expansion in terms of low efficiencies @xmath33 yields the same result .",
    "moreover , the second order term includes intensity field correlations , @xmath34 , which have been studied in the context of nonclassicality determination  @xcite . the fact that we can get these number - amplitude cross correlation highlights the nonlinear character of @xmath20 in eq .  .",

    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite .",

    "we observe that even in the case of imperfect detection and a small number of apds , we can identify squeezing through condition   for all parameters @xmath60 .",

    ", it has been demonstrated that nonclassicality can be uncovered in terms of higher - order correlations . by applying more than one phase sensitive click counting device , it is possible to infer phase sensitive correlations between multimode radiation fields .",
