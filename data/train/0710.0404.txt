    "recent results of wmap @xcite together with ia supernovae data give us the following range for the dark energy state parameter @xmath0 . from theoretical point of view",
    "it is natural to distinguish three essential different cases , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the third one is more challenging one because it violates all natural energy conditions and there might appear problems of an instability at classical and quantum level .",
    "recently it was proposed to consider @xmath4-brane decay in cubic superstring field theory as a model of cosmological dark energy @xcite . at the same time",
    "there have been a number of attempts to realize description of the early universe via nonlocal cosmological models ( for more details see @xcite and refs therein ) .    in this work",
    "we will continue research @xcite of properties of nonlocal cosmological models derived from string field theory .",
    "more precisely , we will consider a cosmological model based on gravity interacting with tachyon matter governed by the tachyon action in cssft when fields up to zero mass are taken into account @xcite .",
