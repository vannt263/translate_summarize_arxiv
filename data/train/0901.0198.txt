    "in recent years , eruptive objects with maximum luminosities intermediate between those of classical novae ( cne ) and supernovae ( sne ) have been discovered in increasing numbers , as surveys for galactic and extragalactic transients are made with greater depth and sky coverage by professional and amateur astronomers .",
    "the term `` supernova impostors '' was introduced by van dyk et al.(2000 ) following the outburst of sn  1997bs .",
    "sn  1997bs was classified as a sn  iin event , `` n '' denoting narrow emission lines during outburst , in contrast to the high ejection velocities of typical sne .",
    "however , it reached an absolute magnitude at maximum of only @xmath7 , more than 3  mag fainter than a typical core - collapse sn .",
    "van  dyk et al .  argued that sn  1997bs was instead a `` superoutburst '' of a massive luminous blue variable ( lbv ) , analogous to those experienced by the galactic objects p  cygni and @xmath8  carinae ( see humphreys , davidson , & smith 1999 ) .",
    "the subject of intrinsically faint sne  iin and @xmath8  car analogs has been summarized by van  dyk ( 2005 ) and smith et al.(2008 ) .",
    "more recently , sn  2008s , which had a sn  iin - type spectrum but reached only @xmath9 , has been discussed by thompson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and smith et al .",
    "prieto et al .  (",
    "2008 ) have identified the precursor of sn  2008s in pre - outburst mid - ir images obtained with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ , demonstrating that the progenitor was a luminous star deeply embedded in circumstellar dust .",
    "v838  monocerotis is the prototype of an apparently separate class of transients also lying in the cn - sn gap .",
    "v838  mon erupted in 2002 , illuminating a spectacular light echo that provided a geometric distance ( sparks et al .",
    "2008 ) implying an absolute magnitude at maximum of @xmath10 . unlike a cn ,",
    "v838  mon became progressively redder during its outburst , eventually becoming enshrouded in circumstellar dust .",
    "its outburst light curve ( bond et al .",
    "2003 ) was very different from that of a sn or lbv eruption , showing a series of four maxima separated by about a month each .",
    "the cause of this outburst remains uncertain , but a leading suggestion is that it was a stellar collision or merger ( e.g. , tylenda & soker 2006 , corradi & munari 2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "possible extragalactic analogs of v838  mon ",
    "although this interpretation is controversial  include the `` m31  red variable '' ( `` m31  rv '' ) which reached @xmath11 ( bond & siegel 2006 and references therein ) , and a luminous red transient in m85 ( rau et al .  2007 ;",
    "kulkarni et al .  2007 ) , which attained @xmath12 .",
    "m31  rv and the m85 transient appear to have occurred in old populations , suggesting that they did not arise from very massive progenitors .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we report observations of a luminous transient discovered in 2008 may in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc  300 .",
    "we obtained extensive ground - based imaging , photometry , and spectroscopy , and we also investigated pre- and post - outburst space - based optical and infrared images of the transient .",
    "this _ letter _ presents an overview of our results , along with a preliminary discussion of the nature of this remarkable object .",
    "subsequent publications will give fuller details .",
    "we designate the object as the `` ngc  300 optical transient , '' hereafter `` ngc  300  ot . ''",
    "the outburst of ngc  300  ot was discovered by monard ( 2008 ) during his sn search program with the bronberg observatory 0.3-m telescope equipped with a ccd camera .",
    "the ot was detected at broad - band magnitude 14.3 on a frame obtained on 2008 may 14 ( all dates in this paper are ut ) .",
    "subsequent inspection of an image from 2008 april 24 , taken in morning twilight shortly after ngc  300 had emerged from behind the sun , showed that the ot was already rising , at @xmath216.3  mag .",
    "it was fainter than 18  mag on 2008 february  8 , and on all previous bronberg observations .",
    "ngc  300 is an sad spiral in the sculptor group , located just outside the local group .",
    "the ot lies in a spiral arm with active star formation .",
    "we adopt a distance modulus of @xmath13 ( @xmath14  mpc ) , based on cepheids ( gieren et al .",
    "2005 ) and the red - giant tip ( rizzi et  al .  2006 ) .    at maximum",
    "the ot was much fainter than a typical sn , but brighter than any cn . because of our interest in luminous red transients , we began a program of photometric and spectroscopic monitoring , using the 1.3- and 1.5-m telescopes at cerro tololo interamerican observatory operated by the smarts consortium .",
    "the photometric monitoring in particular was intensive at first , because of our expectation that the ot might exhibit periodic spikes , like those during the outburst of v838  mon ( bond et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we used the andicam optical / near - ir direct camera ( depoy et al .",
    "2003 ) on the smarts 1.3-m with ccd and ir detectors , operated simultaneously , for the _ bvri _ and _ jhk _ photometry .",
    "the _ bvri _",
    "magnitudes of the ot were determined differentially with respect to a nearby comparison star , calibrated on photometric nights using landolt ( 1992 ) standard fields .",
    "the _ jhk _",
    "magnitudes are differential with respect to the same star , calibrated using its 2mass photometry . the j2000 position of the ot , based on astrometry of andicam frames calibrated against the usno - nomad catalog , is ra = 00:54:34.51 , dec = @xmath15:38:31.4 , with errors in each coordinate of about @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "figure  1 shows the _ bvrijhk _ light curve .",
    "unfortunately , the rise to maximum was poorly covered , but it appears that it was more rapid than the subsequent slower decline .",
    "the brightest @xmath5 magnitude we measured was 14.69 , on the first night of smarts observations ( 2008 may 15 ) , corresponding to @xmath18 to @xmath19 for the adopted distance and a reddening lying in the range @xmath20 to 0.4 ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "following maximum light , the ot has declined smoothly in brightness at all wavelengths , while becoming steadily redder .",
    "for example , @xmath21 evolved from 3.1 in mid - may to 7.4 at the beginning of 2008 december .",
    "the rate of decline in the optical lessened around the beginning of 2008 september , but at this writing the brightness continues to decrease in both the optical and near - ir .",
    "the @xmath22 magnitudes are not fading as rapidly as in the other filters , due to strong h@xmath23 emission .",
    "we obtained low- and moderate - resolution optical spectroscopy of ngc  300  ot throughout its outburst , using the smarts 1.5-m cassegrain spectrograph .",
    "our first low - resolution spectrum was observed on 2008 may 15 ( bond , walter , & velsquez 2008 ) and is shown in figure  2 ( top spectrum ; resolution 17.2   ) . this spectrum exhibits strong emission at h@xmath23 , h@xmath24 , the triplet at 854284988662   , and the unusual forbidden [ ] doublet at 72917323   .",
    "the balmer lines are only slightly resolved at the velocity resolution ( @xmath25 ) of the spectrum .",
    "the underlying continuum resembles a high - luminosity f - type supergiant , with h and k seen in absorption along with several weaker luminosity - sensitive lines such as the triplet at 7774   .",
    "our photometry at maximum and shortly afterwards yields @xmath26 , implying that the inter- and circumstellar extinction could be as high as @xmath27 , since a mid- to late f - type supergiant normally has @xmath28 .",
    "the mean foreground reddening of ngc  300 is @xmath29 ( gieren et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "this spectrum is clearly not that of a cn nor a typical sn . with strong and [ ] emission and an f - type absorption spectrum",
    ", it resembles that of the type  iin supernova impostor sn  2008s ( steele et al .",
    "2008 ; smith et al .",
    "it is also closely similar to the spectra of the well - studied post - red supergiant irc  + 10420 ( jones et al .",
    "1993 ; humphreys , davidson , & smith 2002 ) , variable  a in m33 in its recent quiescent state ( humphreys et al .  2006 ) , and v838  mon near its maximum ( e.g. , wisniewski et al .",
    "these f - type supergiant spectra with superposed narrow emission lines of relatively low excitation are indicative of eruptions that produce an optically thick wind or slowly expanding envelope .",
    "as the ot declined , its spectrum became dominated by the h@xmath23 and emission .",
    "one example , selected from our monitoring program , is the bottom spectrum shown in figure  2 , obtained on 2008 august  23 . by this date ,",
    "the continuum had faded dramatically and reddened somewhat , but the strong emission remained .",
    "we also obtained moderate - resolution ( 3.1   ) spectra regularly with the smarts 1.5-m spectrograph , and on three occasions with the magellan 6.5-m telescope and mage echellette spectrograph ( marshall et al .  2007 ;",
    "resolution 1.5    at , 1.1    at h@xmath23 ) : 2008 july  6 , aug 30 , and sep  1 .",
    "these spectra show that the triplet , h@xmath23 , and h@xmath24 have double - peaked emission lines , with the blue component being the stronger .",
    "figure  3 shows the h@xmath23 and emission features from the magellan echellette spectra on 2008 july  6 ( top spectrum ) and the average of the august 30 and september  1 observations ( bottom spectrum ) , and illustrates the double structure of these lines .",
    "double emission is usually attributed either to a bipolar outflow or a rotating disk , but in the case of an eruption , the double lines are most likely formed in a bipolar wind .",
    "irc  + 10420 shows very similar double - peaked emission and has strong independent evidence for a bipolar outflow ( davies et al .",
    "2007 ; patel et al .  2008 ) .",
    "the peak of the ot s primary blue component slowly increases in strength with time relative to the red component , supporting our conclusion that the outflow is bipolar , with the nearer , blue - shifted lobe expanding towards us .",
    "the doppler velocities measured from both the hydrogen and emission lines in the echellette spectra indicate expansion velocities for the primary wind of @xmath270@xmath30 with respect to the star s systemic velocity of about @xmath31 .",
    "there is evidence as well for additional emission components , appearing as shoulders or secondary bumps on the primary blue and red peaks at velocities of @xmath32@xmath33 .",
    "a wind velocity of @xmath2@xmath34 is typical of the winds of f - type supergiants , and is somewhat lower than the winds associated with lbvs in eruption .",
    "it is very similar to the expansion velocity of @xmath2@xmath35 of irc  + 10420 ( jones et al .",
    "1993 ; humphreys et al .  2002 ) .",
    "by contrast , the [ ] lines , formed in a very low - density region , do not show a double - peaked structure ; they probably arise in more - distant and slower - moving material , likely formed before the current eruption .",
    "we imaged the site of the ot twice with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( ) , in the director s discretionary ( dd ) program go-11553 ( pi : bond ) .",
    "we used the wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) with the f450w and f814w filters ; observations were made on 2008 june  9 and september  1 . in addition , the archive contains two sets of deep observations made before the outburst , obtained with the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) and the f435w , f475w , f555w , f606w , and f814w filters .",
    "the acs observations were made on 2002 december  25 ( go-9492 , pi : f.  bresolin ) and 2006 november 810 ( go-10915 , pi : j.  dalcanton ) .",
    "we used these data to locate the ot precisely , search for a progenitor object , study the surrounding stellar population , and set limits on a light echo from the outburst .",
    "in addition to the data , we were awarded dd time on the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) to obtain near - ir imaging of the ot , using the adaptive - optics naco camera ( lenzen et al .",
    "2003 ; rousset et al .",
    "the vlt / naco images were obtained on 2008 june  6 .",
    "the wfpc2 exposure times for our dd observations ranged from 5 to 260  s , chosen so as not to saturate the image of the ot , but to show enough of the surrounding star field for precise registration with the pre - outburst acs frames .",
    "the archival acs frames are considerably deeper , with total exposure times of 1080 , 2976 , 1080 , 3030 , and 4524  s in f435w , f475w , f555w , f606w , and f814w , respectively .",
    "the vlt / naco @xmath36-band frames were four 600  s exposures , combined in the eso pipeline to produce a single image .",
    "figure  4 shows a montage of post- and pre - outburst images .",
    "the  ot lies amid a rich field of resolved stars .",
    "remarkably , however , there is no significant detection of a progenitor object at the ot s precise location .",
    "the two nearest reliably detected sources lie about @xmath37 and @xmath38 from the site , well in excess of our registration error of about @xmath39 .",
    "these two stars are red giants with f606w magnitudes of about 26.3 and 27.0 . in the deepest stacked pre - outburst images there are suggestions of local maxima at the ot site , but these are all consistent with noise . from the three deepest acs stacked images , we find the following limiting magnitudes ( vega - mag scale , 3@xmath40 upper limits ) for the ot progenitor : 28.3 ( f475w ) , 28.5 ( f606w ) , and 26.6 ( f814w ) .",
    "similar limiting magnitudes were reported earlier , based on registering the 2006 acs images with ground - based magellan / clay 6.5-m images , by berger & soderberg ( 2008 ) , but with larger positional uncertainties .",
    "the ot was thus very unlike a typical core - collapse sn , for which luminous progenitor stars are being found relatively easily in archival images at distances greater than that of ngc  300 ( e.g. , smartt et al .",
    "2008 and references therein ) , nor was it similar to erupting lbvs , which even in quiescence have high optical luminosities ( e.g. , humphreys & davidson 1994 ) .",
    "the acs images also provide deep cmds for the environment surrounding the  ot .",
    "these will be presented in detail in a subsequent publication , but we note that there is a rich population of young objects in the immediate vicinity of the ot .",
    "for example , within @xmath41 ( @xmath223  pc ) of the ot site there are over a dozen blue main - sequence stars brighter than about f606w magnitude 26 , reaching as bright as @xmath42 ( corresponding to b1 stars of @xmath32@xmath43 ) .",
    "the surrounding spiral - arm field is rich in blue clusters and associations .",
    "we compared the post - outburst images of 2008 june  9 and september  1 in search of an expanding light echo , similar to the one surrounding v838  mon ( e.g. , bond 2007 , sparks et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "although a light echo of the surface brightness and angular size of v838  mon s , moved to the distance of ngc  300 , would have been detectable at resolution , no echo is seen .",
    "the very faint limits on the pre - outburst optical brightness of ngc  300  ot initially suggested to us that there was a similarity with v838  mon , whose progenitor was also optically inconspicuous ( e.g. , afar & bond 2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , the very different light curve and spectroscopic behavior of the ot as its outburst proceeded casts doubt on this parallel .",
    "moreover , a striking difference emerged when one of us ( prieto 2008 ) reported that the progenitor of the ot _ was _ detected as a bright mid - ir source in archival observations obtained with _ spitzer _ on 2003 november  21 ( pi : g.  helou ) and 2007 december  28 ( pi : r.  kennicutt ) .",
    "the source was present in all four irac bands ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8  ) , and in the mips 24  band .",
    "a black - body fit to the 3.624  fluxes gives the following results for the luminosity , effective temperature , and radius of the ot progenitor : @xmath44 , @xmath45  k , and @xmath46  au .",
    "these are consistent with a heavily dust - enshrouded red supergiant of @xmath210@xmath6 ( e.g. , maeder & meynet 2000 ) .",
    "there was no variability of the progenitor between 2003 and 2007 .",
    "further detailed discussion of the _ spitzer _ observations is given by thompson et al.(2008 ) .",
    "a picture thus emerges in which a luminous massive star , optically inconspicuous because it was deeply embedded in a dusty envelope , underwent a sudden outburst that cleared most of the surrounding dust . in many respects , ngc  300",
    "ot has behaved remarkably similarly to the supernova impostor sn  2008s ( see  1 ) .",
    "sn  2008s was also heavily enshrouded by dust prior to its outburst , with an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath47 based on its ir sed , implying an initial mass of @xmath2@xmath48 .",
    "the energy released in the ot s eruption was relatively modest . integrating over the extinction - corrected visual light curve , beginning with the initial detection in 2008 april , and assuming that the bolometric correction is zero , we find that the total energy released was @xmath2@xmath49@xmath50  ergs .",
    "this is similar to the energy radiated by sn  2008s , @xmath2@xmath51  ergs ( smith et al .",
    "2008 ) , but considerably less than the @xmath2@xmath52 ergs emitted in @xmath8  car s great eruption , and of course the @xmath2@xmath53 ergs in true core - collapse sne .    given the large amounts of pre - outburst obscuring dust , both ngc  300  ot and sn  2008s must have experienced significant mass loss as post - main - sequence stars , and were most likely red supergiants ( rsgs ) , post - rsgs , or conceivably lower - mass stars at the tip of the agb just before the outbursts .",
    "thompson et al .  (",
    "2008 ) have suggested that these events may represent a new class of low - luminosity outbursts arising from stars in the mass range @xmath28@xmath54 . by comparison with multi - epoch _ spitzer _",
    "irac observations in m33 , they have identified a group of rare , reddened sources that they call extreme - agb stars , which may be the progenitor class in a short - lived stage lasting only @xmath55@xmath56  yr immediately preceding the outbursts .",
    "there are also many enshrouded oh / ir stars in our own galaxy , including agb - tip stars and red supergiants with very red mid - ir colors ; some may be as red as the progenitors of the ot and sn  2008s .",
    "here we suggest that ngc 300 ot , and by analogy sn  2008s , were oh / ir stars before their eruptions . given both objects lack of obvious variability from _ spitzer _ observations several years apart , these ots were not mira variables just before outburst .",
    "they had presumably left the region of rsgs and agb stars in the hr diagram , and were on a blue loop back to warmer temperatures .",
    "the ngc  300 ot s bipolar wind at @xmath3275 km s@xmath57 also supports a warmer temperature for the progenitor . during this transition",
    ", both stars reached a state in which they exceeded the eddington limit for their luminosities and masses and suddenly initiated outflows , bipolar in the case of ngc  300  ot . exactly why this should happen remains uncertain : the eruptions may have resulted from some type of as - yet unexplained failed supernova , a binary merger , or a photospheric eruption",
    ".    continued observations of the ngc  300  ot as it fades are especially important .",
    "we currently observe the spectrum of its wind , but if it does not form another cocoon of dust , we may eventually observe the survivor , determine its true nature , and possibly gain some insight into the cause of its eruption .    partial support for this research was provided by nasa through grant go-11553 from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
    "stsci s participation in the smarts consortium is supported by the stsci director s discretionary research fund .",
