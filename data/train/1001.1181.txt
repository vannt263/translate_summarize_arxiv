    "in a recent article @xcite , we presented variational calculations of phase shifts for the elastic scattering of very low energy positrons , @xmath1 , by ground state molecular hydrogen , @xmath2 .",
    "those calculations involved modifications of the variational method originally due to kohn @xcite and hulthn @xcite ( see also rubinow @xcite ) , which is the analogue of the rayleigh - ritz method @xcite widely used in variational calculations on bound states .",
    "our earlier analysis concentrated on the so - called schwartz singularities @xcite , which are well known to be associated with anomalous behaviour in the results of kohn calculations . in our investigation of @xmath0scattering , we considered the generalization of the kohn method due to kato @xcite as well as the complex kohn method @xcite .",
    "both of these modifications are designed to circumvent problems associated with schwartz - type anomalous behaviour ; the latter especially has become popular in recent years as it has been commonly believed automatically to be free of all nonphysical anomalies .",
    "we have carried out kohn calculations for @xmath0scattering in the fixed - nuclei approximation @xcite so that only the motion of the three light particles need be considered .",
    "all of our calculations use hartree atomic units .",
    "moreover , we regard the positron as being of sufficiently low energy that elastic scattering is the only significant open channel other than positron annihilation and that only the lowest partial wave of @xmath3 symmetry need be investigated .",
    "armour and coworkers @xcite have shown that consideration of this partial wave alone is sufficient to account for @xmath0scattering processes up to @xmath4 ev .",
    "this partial wave is equivalent to the s - wave in atomic scattering .    in this article",
    ", we will construct a framework ultimately to describe a formal connection between the mechanics of the real - generalized and complex kohn methods .",
    "we will prove that the phase shift approximation determined in the complex kohn method is exactly equal to that obtained from the real - generalized kohn method ( hereafter referred to as the generalized kohn method , for brevity ) under a particular optimization . in developing the framework leading to this conclusion",
    ", we will establish three other important results .",
    "firstly , we will identify the mathematical origin of a certain class of anomalies as they appear in generalized kohn calculations , before proving that such anomalies are necessarily absent in applications of the complex kohn method .",
    "secondly , we will show that the existence of the anomaly - free singularities we reported earlier @xcite is fully accounted for by this framework . finally , for both the generalized and complex kohn methods",
    ", we will demonstrate that explicit solutions of the variational equations are not required to obtain optimized phase shift approximations , since these can be determined generally from the evaluation of four matrix determinants .",
    "the optimized results show that the generalized and complex kohn methods are equivalent .    the treatment given here for @xmath0scattering is sufficiently general that it should not be difficult to adapt it to other physical systems .",
    "indeed , it applies directly to potential scattering problems and single open channel scattering problems , with exchange if required .",
    "we will , therefore , concentrate on abstract mechanisms rather than presenting numerical data from individual calculations . following the analysis",
    ", we will briefly relate our framework to earlier work on avoiding the schwartz singularities and the more familiar notation generally used by other authors ( see , for example , burke @xcite , and burke and joachain @xcite , with multichannel extensions summarized by nesbet @xcite ) .",
    "we will also demonstrate why we do not use this more familiar notation throughout .",
    "concerning the present calculations , our implementation of the generalized kohn method is analogous to that described in a previous article @xcite , so only a brief review of the basic principles will be given here .",
    "we approximate the exact leptonic scattering wavefunction , @xmath5 , with a trial wavefunction , viz .",
    "@xmath6    where    @xmath7 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\cos(\\tau ) & \\sin(\\tau)\\\\ -\\sin(\\tau ) & \\cos(\\tau)\\\\ \\end{array}\\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } { s}\\\\ { c}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ]    as we have explained elsewhere @xcite , @xmath8 is a phase parameter that can be adjusted to avoid nonphysical , anomalous behaviour in the results of kohn calculations .",
    "the functions , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , form a basis that represents very low energy incident and scattered positrons asymptotically far from the target molecule ; they account only for the lowest partial wave of @xmath3 symmetry and they are independent of @xmath11 . for convenience",
    ", their explicit forms will here be taken to be the same as those defined by equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of our earlier article @xcite . in those calculations ,",
    "prolate spheroidal coordinates were used for their convenience in describing the two - centre @xmath2system , though the general features of the following analysis are not particular to this choice .",
    "that is to say , without any great modifications an equivalent treatment could be given for different bases and coordinate systems better suited to other problems .",
    "for example , calculations on short - range radial - potential partial wave scattering @xcite use spherical coordinates with open channel radial functions which are asymptotically proportional to spherical bessel functions .",
    "the function , @xmath12 , is a real - valued , unit - normalized approximation to the electronic ground state wavefunction of the unperturbed hydrogen molecule .",
    "it is evaluated at a fixed internuclear separation , typically the equilibrium value .",
    "other than the requirements that it is square - integrable and independent of both @xmath11 and the coordinates of the positron , the precise form of @xmath12is not important here ( although an accurate description of the target is , of course , important when calculating physically relevant results @xcite ) .",
    "the functions , @xmath13 , are real - valued short - range correlation functions .",
    "they are used to describe interactions between the positron and the target electrons when they are close together .",
    "apart from the restrictions that they must be independent of @xmath11 and square - integrable , thus contributing negligibly to @xmath14when the positron is asymptotically far from the target molecule , the precise forms of these functions are unimportant here .",
    "it should be noted that ( [ eq : int : trialwaveexpl ] ) does not explicitly contain the function , @xmath15 , which appeared in the kohn trial function used earlier @xcite .",
    "this omission does not affect the generality of our calculations and has been made purely to simplify the notation involved in the analysis that follows .    as before @xcite , for brevity we will abbreviate by @xmath16 any integral of the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the nonrelativistic hamiltonian for the scattering system in the adiabatic nuclei approximation and @xmath19 is the sum of the kinetic energy of the positron and the ground state energy expectation value of @xmath12 .",
    "integrals of this form are evaluated over the configuration space of the positron and the two electrons .",
    "the operator , @xmath20 , contains a term of the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , the kinetic energy operator and the wavenumber of the positron .",
    "consequently , for @xmath24 and @xmath25 as in @xcite , it is well known that    @xmath26    where we have defined    @xmath27    in which @xmath28 is the fixed internuclear separation and @xmath29 is an arbitrary normalization constant appearing as a factor in the explicit forms of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the explicit form of the coefficient of proportionality in ( [ eq : int : kt ] ) is specific to the choice of basis .",
    "for example , in the aforementioned case of short - range potential scattering @xcite the coefficient is simply @xmath30 , assuming the radial @xmath9 and @xmath10 functions are each associated with a common spherical harmonic for angle - function normalization .",
    "since @xmath18 is hermitian , the @xmath13 are all square - integrable and each term in ( [ eq : int : trialwaveexpl ] ) is real - valued , we note that    @xmath31 henceforth , we will make implicit use of these properties .    in the generalized kohn method ,",
    "a stationary principle is used to determine optimal values of the unknown parameters , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , in @xmath14 .",
    "this principle manifests itself in the system of linear equations ,    @xmath34    where    @xmath35,\\\\   \\label{eq : vecb}b&=&\\left[\\begin{array}{c }            \\langle\\bar{c}\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}},\\bar{s}\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}}\\rangle \\\\       \\langle\\chi_{1},\\bar{s}\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}}\\rangle \\\\       \\vdots \\\\       \\langle\\chi_{m},\\bar{s}\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}}\\rangle \\\\",

    "\\label{eq : matac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath36 is nonsingular then the solution of ( [ eq : kohneq ] ) uniquely determines optimal values for the unknown parameters in @xmath14 .",
    "this solution can then be used to calculate a variational approximation , ps .",
    "@xmath37 $ ] , to the exact scattering phase shift , @xmath38 .",
    "we note for generality that if the method is applied to single channel electron scattering with exchange , whilst the definition of @xmath16 changes to account for antisymmetrization , the abstract forms of ( [ eq : int : sccs ] ) and ( [ eq : int : herm2])([eq : matac ] ) are unaltered .    for @xmath9 and @xmath10 as in @xcite ,",
    "ps . is obtained implicitly from the definition ,    @xmath39,\\ ] ]    in which @xmath40 . the appearance of the parameter , @xmath41 , in ( [ eq : int : tan ] ) is an artefact of the particular choice of basis functions , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , in our @xmath0calculations .",
    "when using prolate spheroidal coordinates , it is convenient to construct these functions in such a way that they include a phase factor equal to @xmath42 .",
    "the appearance of @xmath41 in ( [ eq : int : tan ] ) merely compensates for this phase factor and plays no ` active ' part in the following analysis .",
    "the functional , @xmath43 $ ] , is defined as    @xmath44 = \\langle \\psi_{\\mathrm{t}},\\psi_{\\mathrm{t}}\\rangle\\ ] ]    and , when the kohn equations ( [ eq : kohneq ] ) are satisfied , can be shown to take the form    @xmath45=\\langle\\bar{s}\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}},\\bar{s}\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}}\\rangle+a_{\\mathrm{t}}\\langle\\bar{s}\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}},\\bar{c}\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}}\\rangle+\\sum_{j=1}^{m } p_{j}\\langle\\bar{s}\\psi_{\\mathrm{g}},\\chi_{j}\\rangle.\\ ] ]    under these circumstances , upon substitution of the solution of ( [ eq : kohneq ] ) into ( [ eq : int : tan ] ) , the error in @xmath46 from @xmath47 can be shown to be second order in the error of @xmath14from @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this is the attraction of the kohn variational principle .      in the case where @xmath36 is singular , the system of kohn equations ( [ eq : kohneq ] ) either has no unique solution or no solution at all , and the variational method breaks down . where @xmath36 is nonsingular , it has been widely documented @xcite that the results of kohn calculations can exhibit nonphysical behaviour when the values of various parameters in the kohn trial function are close to values making @xmath36 singular . in the generalized kohn method , problems associated with these so - called schwartz singularities are accounted for by the inclusion of the adjustable phase parameter , @xmath8 . as we have already noted @xcite , for a sufficiently accurate trial function the choice of @xmath11 should have no significant physical effect on the calculation of ps . and , in this respect",
    ", we can regard it as a free parameter .",
    "consequently , if @xmath48 denotes the difference in the phase shift approximations obtained at two similar values of @xmath11 separated by @xmath49 , the typical dependence of ps . on @xmath11",
    "is such that @xmath50 is small .",
    "however , if @xmath11 is close to a value , @xmath51 , making @xmath36 singular , then nonphysical anomalies can arise and these are characterized by large values of @xmath50 .",
    "we have found @xcite that a choice of @xmath8 can normally be made successfully to avoid anomalies of this kind at a given positron energy .",
    "we shall now develop a framework formally to describe the underlying mathematical structure of those anomalies in @xmath52encountered by varying @xmath11 at a fixed @xmath53 .",
    "this framework offers a complete , analytic description of @xmath52 .",
    "we begin by considering the determinant of @xmath36 ( [ eq : mata ] ) ; from the laplace expansion of @xmath54along the first row of @xmath36 , then subsequently along the first column of each resulting submatrix of @xmath36 , using ( [ eq : tautrans ] ) we obtain    @xmath55    where @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 depend on @xmath53 but are independent of @xmath11 .",
    "if , by accident , @xmath61 such that @xmath62 , then @xmath63 is identically zero and a unique value of ps . can not be determined from the kohn equations at any value of @xmath11 .",
    "we define    @xmath64    to ensure that our kohn calculations can always be implemented consistently for some choice of @xmath11 , we will henceforth consider only values of @xmath65 rather than @xmath66 , although for brevity we will not usually mention this distinction explicitly . in practice",
    ", we have not yet found any such value of @xmath67 in our numerical calculations .",
    "it is conceivable , though very unlikely , that such a value might occur by accident for some configuration of parameters in the trial wavefunction , but then it should be possible to vary the nonlinear parameters in the short - range correlation functions always to avoid this eventuality .",
    "hence , we consider the case @xmath61 here purely so that it can be excluded , in the interests of good mathematical practice . for each @xmath65",
    ", there exists at least one value of @xmath11 such that @xmath36 is nonsingular .",
    "next , consider the matrix , @xmath68 , formed by replacing the first column of @xmath36 by @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is as in ( [ eq : vecb ] ) , so that    @xmath71.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    by the same method used to find ( [ eq : comp : determinant ] ) , we have    @xmath72    where @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 depend on @xmath53 but are independent of @xmath11 .",

    "a proof of this result is given in [ app : theta ] .",

    "<S> this framework also explains the mathematical origin of the anomaly - free singularities we reported in a previous article . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we demonstrate a novelty , that explicit solutions of the kohn equations are not required in order to calculate optimal phase shift approximations . we relate our rigorous framework to earlier descriptions of the kohn - type methods . </S>"
