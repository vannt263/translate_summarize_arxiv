    "one of the current goals of ultracold atom physics is to reach deeper quantum degeneracy for fermi gases , which could enable the study of new phases of matter otherwise prevented by thermal effects @xcite .",
    "the adaptation of evaporative cooling techniques so successful in the case of bose gases to fermi gases has been proven to be challenging , and so far the best degeneracy factors achieved have been in the @xmath1 range @xcite .",
    "physically , the origin of this plateau is rooted in the intrinsic difference between bosons and fermions . for the former , a cooling technique based on many - body effects such as evaporative cooling seems favourable as bosons tend to bunch in the same region of phase space and energy .",
    "fermions instead manifest the opposite behavior , hence the lack of spatial overlap creates increasing difficulty as the degenerate regime is approached , further creating peculiar sources of heating @xcite . limits to the efficiency of dual evaporative cooling between two distinguishable components of a fermi gas",
    "have been discussed @xcite and found to be in line with previous experimental findings @xcite .",
    "a compromise may consist in using sympathetic cooling of fermi gas via bose gases but , as noticed in @xcite , the diminished heat capacity of a bose gas at the onset of bose - einstein condensation makes sympathetic cooling increasingly inefficient .",
    "although techniques to mitigate this limitation using species - selective traps have been proposed @xcite and implemented in the bose counterparts @xcite , their broad application to reach quantum degeneracy in fermi - bose mixtures remains pending , with the notable exception of a very recent report on yb - rb mixtures @xcite .",
    "considering that a decade - long effort has not yet resulted in appreciable progress in fermi cooling , one may ask whether it is possible to envision other cooling techniques which may transform the shortcomings of a fermi gas into assets . in this paper",
    ", we discuss such a possibility by exploiting a well - known _ individual _ cooling technique , doppler cooling in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , and a _ collective _ effect unique of fermi systems , the narrowing of the spontaneous emission linewidth .",
    "the analysis is first carried out on an atomic gas confined in a magneto - optical trap to illustrate the basics of the effect , as discussed in sec .",
    "the limitations of doppler cooling for fermionic isotopes of alkali - metal atoms brings to a more elaborated setup consisting in a hybrid configuration in which cooling is still ensured by the mot , and trapping is achieved by a stiff optical dipole trap ( odt ) , as discussed in sec . iii . in sec",
    "iv we focus on the limitations to the cooling capability due to heating sources , and we discuss estimates of heating due to rayleigh scattering in the odt , showing that this should not compromise the achievement of quantum degeneracies comparable to the ones currently achieved with other cooling techniques .",
    "advantages and drawbacks of the proposal are then discussed in the conclusions , with particular regard to its implementation in optical lattices .",
    "it is well - known that in the strongly degenerate regime a fermi gas is expected to manifest inhibition of spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , three energy scales compete in determining the inhibition : the fermi energy @xmath2 , the recoil energy @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 the wavelenght of the doppler cooling cycling transition ) , and the average thermal energy @xmath5 , with @xmath6 denoting the boltzmann constant . under the restrictions dictated by the pauli principle",
    ", single - particle states in the energy range @xmath7 are partially occupied , so they can still accept an atom which undergoes spontaneous emission provided that its motional energy ( given on average by the recoil energy plus the always present bonus of thermal energy , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath8 ) falls in the same energy range .",
    "if , however , the fermi energy is made too large with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath5 , the transition becomes progressively unlikely , as the motional energy is not enough to allow hopping into the energy levels still partially occupied .",
    "this effect has been studied quantitatively via explicit evaluation of the matrix element with numerical techniques @xcite , and with a local density approximation @xcite . with reference to this last approximation , if @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the intrinsic spontaneous emission linewidth and the spontaneous emission linewidth including the effect of the pauli principle , respectively , then the spontaneous emission suppression factor @xmath12 is @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fugacity of the fermi gas , with @xmath15 its inverse temperature , @xmath16 the chemical potential , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 belongs to the set of functions defined in general in terms of the fermi integral @xmath19 evaluated in the specific case of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gamma function .",
    "is plotted versus the degeneracy factor @xmath0 for different values of the fermi energy in units of the recoil energy , from top to bottom curves , @xmath22 ( black ) , @xmath23 ( red ) , @xmath24 ( blue ) , @xmath25 ( green ) , and @xmath26 ( magenta ) .",
    "the continuous lines are evaluated assuming a temperature - dependent chemical potential , while the dashed lines are obtained by using the approximation @xmath27 valid only at low @xmath0 ( see also fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "in the inset the complementary dependence of @xmath28 upon the @xmath29 ratio at constant temperature is shown for values @xmath30 ( black , continuous ) , @xmath31 ( red , dashed ) , and @xmath32 ( blue , dot - dashed).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the dependence of @xmath28 on the degeneracy factor @xmath0 is shown through the continuous lines in fig .  1 , for various values of the ratio @xmath29 .",
    "the chemical potential of the fermi gas has been evaluated at all temperatures with a function interpolating between the two extreme limits of the sommerfeld expansion , @xmath33,\\ ] ] and the high - temperature limit @xmath34.\\ ] ]    the dashed lines in fig .",
    "1 are instead evaluated through the sommerfeld approximation with the chemical potential equal to the fermi energy , @xmath35 , only valid at low @xmath0 .",
    "the expected failure of this approximation at high temperature is manifested through an asymptotic value of @xmath36 for @xmath37 and more optimistic values of the suppression factor at any finite temperature .",
    "the curves show that inhibition of spontaneous emission is ineffective at low values of @xmath29 , and that it becomes progressively less sensitive to @xmath29 when this ratio becomes much larger than unity , an effect corroborated by showing its explicit dependence as in the inset of fig .  1 .",
    "the analysis of the plots suggests that , if the initial temperature is such that there is already some degree , even if small , of quantum degeneracy , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath38 , the linewidth @xmath11 should become slighty smaller than its intrinsic value @xmath10 , and consequently the doppler limit temperature @xmath39 would be shifted to a smaller value , which also implies that the lowest temperature achieved during doppler cooling will become smaller .",
    "this in turn implies a smaller degeneracy factor @xmath0 , which implies a smaller @xmath11 and then again a smaller doppler limit temperature .",
    "this loop will continue until the doppler temperature becomes of the same order of magnitude of the recoil temperature .",
    "this iterative dynamics can be made explicit with a simple recursive relationship in which each time step is of the order of the spontaneous emission lifetime @xmath40 , and we assume that equilibration timescales are comparable to this parameter .",
    "the temperature of the atomic cloud after the n - th time step is then @xmath41 where we indicate the explicit dependence on @xmath42 even if for now we consider a situation in which @xmath2 is kept constant .",
    "it is clear from this simple relationship and the plots in fig .  1 that there is a fixed point corresponding to zero temperature . in fig .",
    "2a we show the dynamics due to the iterative mapping of eq .",
    "( 5 ) for a fermi gas precooled to the recoil limit temperature , that is , with initial temperature equal to @xmath43 .",
    "due to the highly nonlinear behavior of the iterative map , the temperature becomes extremely sensitive to the initial value of @xmath29 and the number of iterations .",
    "the fastest cooling trajectory shown in fig .",
    "2a occurs for @xmath44 , in which a dozen of iterations appear to be enough to reach @xmath45 .",
    "conversely , about @xmath46 iterations are required to reach @xmath47 if @xmath22 , which is also aggravated by the fact that the actual time step is not uniform , but depends itself upon the degree of fermi degeneracy .",
    "indeed , being the spontaneous lifetime inversely proportional to the transition linewidth , the actual times for cooling and equilibration of a more degenerate cloud becomes proportionately longer , and the equally spaces steps in the horizontal axis of fig .",
    "2a should be replaced by time intervals of amplitude @xmath48 . in fig .",
    "2b we show the complementary dependence of @xmath0 upon the number of iterations keeping constant the @xmath29 ratio and varying the initial temperature , giving informations on the sensitivity of the iterative scheme upon initial states with temperature higher than the recoil temperature .",
    "alternatively , the iterative relationship in eq .",
    "( 5 ) can be easily converted into a differential equation keeping in mind that the timescale for cooling is of the order of the spontaneous emission lifetime ,    @xmath49    in which an effective cooling timescale may be identified as @xmath50^{-1}$ ] depending on the degeneracy parameter @xmath0 and then on time , confirming that the dynamics is highly nonlinear .",
    "the maximal cooling speed is achieved in the intermediate regime @xmath51 , while it tends to zero both in the case of @xmath28 close to unity  _ i.e. _ far from quantum degeneracy , when the linewidth suppression is not present  and when @xmath28 is close to zero , _",
    "i.e. _ when the spontaneous lifetime tends to infinity slowing down the cooling process . in fig .",
    "3 we show the implications in terms of the time dependence of the degeneracy parameter for the same iterative scheme discussed in fig .  2a , and the spontaneous emission lifetime of the dominant transition @xmath52 in @xmath53li , ( @xmath54 nm , @xmath55 mhz ) .",
    "while all curves show @xmath56 as @xmath57 , their behavior at finite time is different , with the appearance of an optimal , intermediate value of @xmath29 leading to maximum cooling , a situation of interest in any realistic scheme , in which obviously a nonzero cooling power is required .",
    "the previous analysis has shown that the initial degeneracy parameter @xmath0 is crucial to ignite the expected runaway process , as specifically seen in fig .",
    "2b . in applications",
    "to specific fermi gases , with @xmath53li and @xmath58k being the only alkali - metal stable or long lifetime fermionic isotopes , the temperature is initially limited by the doppler temperature itself due to the unresolved hyperfine structure preventing efficient optical molasses cooling .",
    "this issue is generally not present in alkaline - earth metal fermionic species , for which the starting point can be a sub - doppler temperature , which in the presence of a degeneracy parameter @xmath0 small enough can start the runaway process until the doppler temperature reaches the recoil temperature .",
    "we deliberately address in the following the less favourable situation of @xmath53li and @xmath58k , also due to their widespread availability in several laboratories .",
    "the cooling process can be made more efficient in spite of the absence of genuine sub - doppler cooling stages by both increasing its speed , related to the @xmath29 ratio as visible in fig .",
    "2a , and decreasing the @xmath0 ratio .",
    "this is simultaneously achieved by adding an odt sharing the same potential energy minimum as the mot , which will increase the fermi energy thereby decreasing @xmath0 while increasing @xmath29 . in this condition ,",
    "the achievement of a temperature close to the recoil temperature is no longer a strong limitation , as far as we are concerned with getting the minimum @xmath0 and not minimum temperatures in an absolute sense .",
    "fortunately , most of the interesting phase transition physics depends on the entropy , which in turn depends on the @xmath0 ratio .     ratio the degeneracy factor decreases , this occurs at the price of a much slower timescale with respect to the case of large @xmath29 ratios .",
    "notice that too large @xmath29 ratios imply large spontaneous lifetimes achieved at early times , which results in precocious slow down of the cooling dynamics , as visible especially for the @xmath44 case.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the coexistence of a mot only utilized for doppler cooling and an odt for stiff trapping is not an issue provided that the laser wavelength for the odt is judiciously chosen to avoid any ac stark shift of the two levels realizing the cycling cooling transition in the mot , as achievable by using the so - called magic wavelengths @xcite .",
    "production of large degenerate samples of @xmath53li has been recently reported in @xcite , to which we also refer for discussions of experimental details , in which the authors have reported efficient doppler and molasses cooling in the presence of the strong light field of the odt .",
    "@xmath53li atoms in the three cases of constant laser power ( blue diamonds , dot - dashed ) of @xmath5910 w , and a linear ramp starting from the initial time until @xmath60 iterations with the same initial value of 10 w and final value of 50 w ( red squares , dashed ) and 100 w ( black circles , continuous ) , with a beam waist @xmath61 m .",
    "the initial temperature of the atoms is assumed to be the doppler temperature for the @xmath52 cyclic transition , @xmath62k , and the laser wavelength is assumed to be @xmath63930.3 nm , minimizing the stark shifts induced by the odt .",
    "the three top curves are relative to the case of a @xmath64 cyclic transition with the initial temperature assumed to be the corresponding doppler temperature of @xmath65k , a laser wavelength of @xmath631070.73 nm , and the same laser power trajectories as for the @xmath52 cyclic transition . due to the weaker optical confinement as a consequence of the smaller linewidth @xmath11 ,",
    "the latter cyclic transition is not favourable despite a smaller initial doppler temperature.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we focus here on the case of @xmath53li , and a crossed odt produced by a laser working at one magic wavelength for the relevant @xmath53li cyclic transition .",
    "the trapping frequencies along the three axes may be written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the instantaneous laser power , @xmath68 the waist of the laser beam , @xmath69i_{\\mathrm{sat}}\\}$ ] , where @xmath70 is the saturation intensity , with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath4 and @xmath73 the atomic transition and laser wavelength , respectively .",
    "the case of the crossed odt , although more difficult to achieve due to the need of focusing two laser beams on the mot center , is the closest to isotropy and avoids excessive spatial mismatching with respect to the pre - existing shape of the atomic cloud in the mot . also , in order to avoid sudden heating of the atomic cloud , the initial laser power should be chosen appropriately to allow for a smooth transition from the mot trapping to the odt trapping , thereby the need to start with a moderate value of the laser power then progressively ramped up .",
    "the linear dependence of the fermi energy on the average trapping frequency @xmath74 , as @xmath75 , and the fact that the average trapping frequency scales as @xmath76 implies a scaling of the degeneracy parameter as @xmath77 .",
    "the effect of the odt on the iterative scheme is shown in fig .  4 for various laser powers and two different cyclic transitions .",
    "the case of the @xmath64 cyclic transition seems apparently more suitable , since in this case the spontaneous emission linewidth is narrower , and in fact slightly larger than the recoil temperature , making the initial conditions more appealing for pauli cooling .",
    "however , due to the dependence of the trapping frequencies on the linewidth and the saturation intensity , the initial confinement is weaker than in the alternative situation of the @xmath52 cyclic transition , if the comparison is made for the same laser power and waist .",
    "this weaker trapping slows down so much the cooling process that , as seen in fig .  4 , the gain in @xmath0 is only due to the ramping of the laser power and the increase in @xmath42 , rather than the intrinsic decrease of @xmath78 .",
    "conversely , in the case of the @xmath52 transition , the cooling is more effective and reaches the recoil limit well before the laser power is settled at a constant value after @xmath60 iterations , at which point further gains in the @xmath0 ratio are only achieved by increasing @xmath42 .",
    "the case of a constant and shallow ( @xmath67=10 w ) optical trap is also shown , to emphasize both the gain in speed and in the achievable mimimum @xmath0 ratio by using time - dependent laser powers .",
    "an obvious limitation in the use of a high power odt is due to the concurring heating rate by off - resonant rayleigh scattering .",
    "also , higher densities of the fermi gas will make molecule formation more likely , and with it a faster decay of the atomic gas through three - body collisions and related processes . in fig .",
    "5 we show the impact on the cooling scheme of two additional limiting factors . first , the odt introduces a heating source due to rayleigh scattering .",
    "although the off - resonance nature of the laser beam should limit this heating source , the effect may affect significantly the cooling efficiency in the latest stages due to the linear dependence of the specific heat of a fermi gas on the @xmath0 ratio , which makes the atomic gas more susceptible to any heating source .",
    "second , as anticipated in sec .",
    "ii , in a realistic modeling the iteration steps should be replaced by the actual time interval occurring for each step , which depends on the spontaneous lifetime and the suppression factor @xmath28 .",
    "this is a further limitation to the cooling scheme since it slows down the dynamics , while rayleigh scattering heating ( although suppressed by quantum degeneracy ) and any other source of heating are present .",
    "the specific heat per unit of atom has been evaluated interpolating between the degenerate regime and the dulong - petit limit with an exponential function @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "the dramatic time dependence of the case with final power of 100 w shows that , once a deep fermi degeneracy is reached , the time scale slows down significantly .",
    "this implies a large exposure to rayleigh heating , further enhanced by the decreased specific heat  thereby the sudden jump , in the next iteration , to much higher degeneracy factors .     in the presence of heating due to rayleigh scattering from the optical dipole trap .",
    "the parameters and the protocols are the same as for the @xmath52 cyclic transition discussed in fig .",
    "3 . plotted",
    "are the time dependence of the laser power ( top curves ) for a constant power of 10 w ( blue , dot - dashed ) , a linear ramp from 10 w to 50 w then kept constant ( red , dashed ) , and a linear ramp from 10 w to 100 w then kept constant ( black , continuous ) , the related specific heats in boltzmann constant units ( middle curves ) , and the resulting @xmath0 trajectories ( bottom curves ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the plots show that there is a minimum in the degeneracy factor @xmath0 achieved when the cooling and heating rates compensate each other . to avoid the detrimental stage occuring after this minimum , the laser power should be accordingly decreased , thereby allowing for an additional stage of evaporative cooling .",
    "the presence of a minimum achievable value for @xmath0 can also be evidenced by analytical estimates completing the differential equation eq .",
    "( 6 ) to include the heating source , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the heating power , and it should be remarked that both @xmath28 and @xmath82 depend upon the degeneracy factor @xmath0 , yielding a highly nonlinear dynamics .",
    "the heating term is independent on temperature in the dulong - petit nondegenerate regime , @xmath83 , while increases in inverse proportion to the degeneracy factor in the fully degenerate regime , @xmath84 .",
    "therefore the most delicate stage for heating occurs at later times , when the linearly decreasing specific heat makes the atomic temperature increasingly susceptible to the presence of heating sources .",
    "likewise , as commented earlier the optimal cooling situation is achieved if the spontaneous scattering suppression factor is @xmath85 , _",
    "i.e. _ when the system is in an intermediate quantum degeneracy regime , and in this situation @xmath86 . under this intermediate regime ,",
    "the balance between cooling and heating rates becomes rather simple , leading to a rough estimate of the minimum degeneracy factor achievable if the limitation is due to heating sources as    @xmath87    we consider the case of heating power due to residual rayleigh scattering in the odt alone , so @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the scattering rate and @xmath90 is the recoil energy due to the scattering of photons from the odt laser beams .",
    "notice that , due to the linear dependence on @xmath11 of @xmath91 , the heating power depends quadratically on @xmath11 and then on the spontaneous suppression factor @xmath28 , making its contribution smaller in the degenerate regime , partially compensating for the larger temperature changes due to the linear drop of the specific heat of the fermi gas .",
    "arising from the recoil limit ( three top black curves ) and the heating and cooling rates estimated in the text through eq .",
    "( 9 ) ( two bottom red curves ) , versus the laser power and for various values of the beam waist and number of fermions .",
    "the parameters are the same as for the @xmath52 cyclic transition discussed in fig .",
    "4.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for the case of @xmath53li @xmath52 transition and power and waist of the odt laser beams respectively of 10 w and 20 @xmath16 m as in the example in fig .",
    "4 , this gives rise to a lower bound of @xmath92 .",
    "this is not the actual limiting factor since the recoil limit @xmath93 , in line with what observed in fig .",
    "5 , is larger by three orders of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the bound expressed by eq .",
    "( 9 ) yields values of @xmath0 for which the initial hypothesis of @xmath85 does not hold , as a visual inspection of fig .",
    "1 shows that for the estimated @xmath0 we get @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , the analytical estimate in eq .",
    "( 9 ) should be considered as a lower bound on the minimum achievable @xmath0 due to heating sources , and its value is also in comparing how the two limitations in @xmath0 depend upon the laser power , the waist of the beams , the number of fermions , as shown in fig .  6 .",
    "the dominance of the recoil limit is evident for any realistic value of the laser power at a moderately large waist of 20 @xmath16 m and for @xmath95 fermions .",
    "the heating limit does not depend on the waist of the laser beam since both the scattering rate and the fermi energy scale as an inverse square power of the waist , however larger number of fermions will increase @xmath2 with different scalings for the two bounds @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( proportional to @xmath98 and to @xmath99 respectively ) , making the limitation due to heating progressively more relevant .",
    "the numerical examples reported here are not fully optimized as they are chosen with an eye towards trapping performances already achieved in various laboratories .",
    "given the high degree of nonlinearity in the protocol and the dependence on the relevant parameters , improvements by at least one order of magnitude with respect to the estimated degeneracy parameter , could be realistically achievable in specific configurations .",
    "the cooling timescale  as visible in fig .",
    "5  seems short , at least for the specific case of the @xmath53li transition used as an example .",
    "however , more elaborated cooling cycles based upon ramping up and down repeatedly the laser power may extend the lifetime of the ultracold sample well beyond the millisecond scale . considering the large trapping frequencies achieved in high - power odts , and the fact that the inverse of the chemical potential usually determines the timescale for building up strongly correlated phases",
    ", we do not expect the cooling timescale being an issue in the study of several phase transitions predicted so far in the ultracold regime . even without fully optimizing the many parameters available , a final degeneracy factor @xmath0 below the @xmath100 range seems within reach , as noticeable in particular looking at the limits in fig .",
    "in conclusion , we have discussed an experimental setup in which a peculiar feature of degenerate fermi gases , the expected narrowing of the spontaneous emission linewidth , may be exploited as a cooling mechanism .",
    "the same advantages of all - optical cooling of atomic gases discussed elsewhere do apply here , without the loss of atoms as in dual evaporative cooling , the complication of simultaneous trapping of a bose gas with large heat capacity as in sympathetic cooling , and with the possibility to fully exploit feshbach resonances .",
    "the concurrent suppression of light scattering expected for a degenerate fermi gas has also two added benefits .",
    "first , the reduced radiation pressure experienced by the atoms allows for higher atomic densities , and atomic heating by light scattering is suppressed in the strong confinement provided by the odt , as experimentally demonstrated in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "second , continuous and precision monitoring of the cloud temperature through off - resonant beams over the duration of the experiment @xcite helps to mitigate another critical issue for degenerate fermi gases , namely the lack of sensitive precision thermometry in the degenerate regime , a crucial point for the study of classical phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the use of tight trapping conditions makes this cooling scheme less palatable for the application to optical lattices in which a degree of spatial homogeneity is often a prerequisite for creating and observing unconventional phases .",
    "however , the combination of this cooling mechanism with adiabatic expansions , such as the ones designed through frictionless cooling @xcite , should mitigate this drawback .",
    "moreover , a direct implementation of pauli blocking schemes to further cooling in optical lattices seems feasible @xcite .",
    "a full expansion of the proposal should also include a treatment of the dynamics of the atoms in a combined mot - odt configuration , as this gives rise to confinements rather different in various spatial regions , with a small , inner region experiencing stiff confinement and a large , outer region loosely confined , and not contributing to the cooling effect exploited in this scheme .",
    "the proposal could take advantage of efforts to produce a large volume odt @xcite , also complementing existing demonstrations of efficient all - optical cooling of atomic gases , either alkaline - earth metals @xcite , or fermionic isotopes of lithium and potassium @xcite via intrinsically narrow transitions .",
    "the experiment described in @xcite seems the closest , both in the set up and parameters space , to a successful implementation of the technique proposed in this paper . from a broader , fundamental physics standpoint",
