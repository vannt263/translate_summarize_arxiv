    "this common excitation process is balanced by the decay of photons from the cavity , so that the rate of excitation by tunneling cooper pairs , @xmath102 , and the photon leakage rates match @xmath103 for equal cavity damping the mean occupations , @xmath104 , are thus identical .",
    "this can be exploited to derive a relation @xcite between cross- and autocorrelations for arbitrary driving strength , @xmath105\\ , .\\ ] ] it implies a violation of the classical cauchy - schwarz inequality and predicts a noise reduction factor @xmath106 , independent of the driving strength and the impedance parameters . in the weak driving regime one furthermore finds @xmath107 , while @xmath108 .    for asymmetric cavity damping , @xmath109 , we instead find @xmath110,\\ ] ] resulting in @xmath111 in the weak driving limit . for our experiment , where the decay rates are found to be identical within about 10% , the maximal deviation of the nrf from the value of 1/2 taken for perfectly symmetric rates is well below a percent .",
    "to pinpoint the physical ingredients necessary for understanding and explaining the essential results presented in this paper , we set up a simple rate equation model .",
    "it allows to reproduce most of the important results in the weak - driving limit of the full theory and qualitatively describes the experimental data in that regime .    in the weak driving limit",
    ", the results for the cross - correlations and nrf can be found from a simple 4-state rate model , see fig .",

    "a common two - photon process excites the system from the empty state @xmath112 to state @xmath113 with some excitation rate @xmath114 .",
    "leakage of photon a ( b ) with rate @xmath115 from the excited state leads to an intermediate state , where cavity a(b ) is empty , and finally back to the ground state @xmath112 .",
    "solving for the stationary state of the resulting rate equation , we find that for weak driving , @xmath116 the probability to stay in the ground state remains close to one and all other occupations are of order @xmath117 , namely @xmath118 .",
    "occupations of higher states are of higher order in @xmath119 , which justifies disregarding them in the 4-state model .",
    "cross - correlation and nrf in the weak - driving limit can then be evaluated from these probabilities : @xmath120 the noise reduction factor reduces to @xmath121 as found above .",
    "the success of the simple rate model highlights the fact , that it is the mere existence of a dominant two - photon excitation process which is at the heart of the observed non - classicality .",
    "the actual rate drops out of the final results , so that the impedance parameters do not influence the nrf .",
    "this also already suggests , that the coherence properties of the process are not relevant and , in fact , we found numerically nearly no impact of low - frequency noise .",
    "note , that a proper description of auto - correlations necessarily includes higher occupations and is , hence , beyond the 4-state model .",
    "the simplest intuitive result for @xmath60 is available in the parametric oscillator limit , @xmath122 , where the enhanced @xmath123 can be traced backed to an increased probability for excitation from a state , where there is already some occupation . technically , this stimulated - emission like enhancement is caused by the corresponding transition - matrix elements entering the tunneling rates .",
    "the dependence of the second - order coherence functions , @xmath100 , on the delay time @xmath77 is relevant for the results of this paper in order to understand the effects of the detector response on the quantity measured as @xmath124 .",
    "we find , that convoluting the theoretically calculated @xmath100 with the detector response yields a substantial reduction of the cross - correlations , while the auto - correlations are less affected . as a consequence ,",
    "the so - predicted reduction of the noise is less pronounced and nicely matches the measurement results of @xmath125 .",
    "for some intuitive insights , we again consider weak driving , so that the individual two - photon creation processes are well separated in time .",
    "the effective time - averaging caused by the detector affects the nrf only because the origin of auto- and cross - correlations differ , and consequently so do their time - dependences .    _ cross - correlations _ at @xmath126 stem from a single two - photon creation process .",
    "the resulting @xmath127 contribution decays with the typical lifetime of such an excitation as @xmath128 .",
    "_ auto - correlations _ in contrast , do not get a direct contribution from a single tunneling event .",
    "in fact , @xmath129 , i.e. the detection of two - photons at once necessarily involves double occupation of cavity @xmath130 .",
    "( as explained above , @xmath131 is enhanced nonetheless , due to a stimulated emission effect , which ultimately also originates in the existence of two - photon excitations . )    considering now times , @xmath132 , there will be contributions to the autocorrelation from an original state ( before the first detection ) with double occupation of cavity @xmath130 which decay .",
    "however , contributions can also stem from observation of a first decay from a single - occupied cavity @xmath130 , followed by refilling of the cavity and a consecutive second decay .",
    "these grow with time , as the refilling process takes some time . on short times , @xmath133",
    ", theory finds that the different time dependences of the two contributions tend to cancel each other , so that the autocorrelation remains roughly constant before finally exponential decay sets in .",
    "this difference in time - dependence causes the detector - induced averaging to rather strongly suppress the cross - correlation , while it has a smaller effect on autocorrelations and thus moves the nrf away from 1/2 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to describe in detail , first , the basic functionality of our correlation setup which we use to directly measure the quantities @xmath134 , @xmath135 and the correlator @xmath136 to construct eq .",
    "( [ eq : g2exp ] ) of the main text without for every frequency combination ( aa , bb and ab ) .",
    "the basic idea is to _ assume _ that the noise of the cryogenic amplifiers can be described as a thermal noise characterized by a constant noise temperature , uniform over modes @xmath15 and @xmath16 , used as a reference to calculate the gains of the various elements of the detection chain .",
    "the power emitted by the sample is split in equal parts between the 3 db hybrid coupler outputs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) of the main text .",
    "hence , the output of each of the two branches of the beam splitter contains half of the power peaking at the two different frequencies @xmath137 and @xmath138  ghz of our resonators attached to the josephson junction . the signals at the two outputs of the hybrid coupler",
    "is then fed into two cryogenic amplifiers sitting at 4.2k , as discussed in the main text and shown in figure [ fig : scheme]-b . as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : correlationsetup ] , the output signals of each of the cryogenic amplifiers goes through isolator after which it is post - amplified with a conventional low - noise room - temperature amplifier , filtered through a 4 - 8  ghz bandpass filter and then , subsequently , it is once more amplified .",
    "we further narrow the bandwidth of the detected signal with passive bandpass filters ( labeled @xmath139 ) centered around @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for subsequent correlation measurements : in order to measure the second order coherence function @xmath140 we use passive bandpass filters in each of the two measurement lines centered around 5  ghz with a bandwidth of 700  mhz in line 1 and 655  mhz in line 2 and for the measurement of @xmath141 we use bandpass filters centered around 6.8  ghz with a bandwidth of 650  mhz in line 1 and 660  mhz in line 2. for the measurement of @xmath142 we use a bandpass filter centered around 6.8  ghz with a bandwidth of 650  mhz build into line 1 and a bandpass filter centered around 5  ghz with a bandwidth of 655  mhz build into line 2 ( note that our results for the second order coherence functions are invariant against changing the filtering from one line to the other which we verified in an extra measurement run ) .    a power divider ( -3db splitter )",

    "the measurement of the mean output power of each microwave chain is made using a slow quadratic detector ( with a response time in the @xmath146s range ) , whose output voltage is proportional to the microwave power at its input .",
    "we use a double lock - in technique to measure both the average power emitter by the sample @xmath147 and the total power @xmath148 of our measurement chain , mainly dominated by the noise of the cryogenic amplifiers at 4.2  k. this last point will allow us to compensate for slow fluctuations of the gain of the chain , still assuming that the noise temperature of the cryogenic amplifiers is constant .    *",
    "measurement of the total average power @xmath148 * : the modulation is performed with a mixer circuit which we use as a switch , the switching is performed via the intermediate frequency ( if ) port of the mixer using an attached square wave generator operating between 0v ( no power transmitted through the mixer ) and 1.1 v ( power transmitted through the mixer ) at 113 hz , and we detect the resulting square wave modulation of the output voltage of the quadratic detector by a standard lock - in technique , after a final low - frequency amplification .",
    "the in- and output of the mixer ( switch ) circuit is connected through dc - blocks ( straight vertical lines in fig .  [ fig : correlationsetup ] ) to the measurement chain to prevent possible near - dc noise from the modulation sources to disturb our low - noise measurements .",
    "furthermore , at each connection between microwave components we add attenuators ( wiggly vertical lines ) to flatten out standing waves due to possible imperfect sma connections and to ensure a linear response of the complete measurement chain .    * measurement of the power emitted by the sample @xmath148 * : second , the excess power emitted by the sample when a voltage bias is applied appears on top of the noise floor of our measurement chain , described previously , and is measured in the following way . by performing simultaneous to the signal modulation for the total power measurement , a modulation of the sample bias voltage at a different reference frequency , we can separately measure the excess power @xmath149 coming exclusively from the sample by performing an additional lock - in detection of the power at the frequency of the bias voltage modulation .",
    "this measurement is performed on the same measurement branch which we use to measure the total power @xmath150 of our measurement chains .    the mean power associated with the outgoing photon mode",
    "is then given by the following equation @xmath151 where @xmath152 indicates the mean of the excess power emitted by the sample into the measurement chains 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath153 are the noise temperatures of the cryogenic microwave amplifiers refered to the output of the sample ( their values depend on whether line 1 or 2 is read out and on the detected mode a or b ) and @xmath154 is the bandwidth of our passive filtering to select the power emerging from modes a and b.",
    "the resonators are patterned in a niobium layer of d = 150  nm sputtered on a silicon wafer covered by a 520  nm oxide layer . both resonators consist of three quarter wavelength sections , one with an impedance slightly higher than @xmath155 , to increase the impedance above @xmath155 , the second with a low impedance to reach an impedance of a few ohms , and a last section with an impedance above @xmath156 , to reach an impedance in the kilo - ohms range .",

    "note that all sections are not designed exactly of identical length , in order to compensate for finite thickness effects of the nb layer and of the oxide layer , and get the fundamental frequencies of the three sections stacked on one side of the junction identical .",
    "however , as shown later , we mistakenly neglected the kinetic inductance of the nb , which made the resonant frequency of the last quarter wavelength section ( i.e. the closest to the junction ) significantly lower than the two other ones .",

    "the difference in power which is deposited in the electromagnetic environment when biasing the josephson junction at two different voltages @xmath159  mv and @xmath160  mv has then to fulfill the following equation :    @xmath161 r_{n}}{\\lvert z(\\nu ) + r_{n } \\rvert^{2}}~.\\ ] ]    here , the right - hand side of the equation quantifies the difference in noise power coupling of the josephson junction with normal - state tunnel resistance @xmath162 to the electromagnetic environment having a complex valued impedance @xmath13 when the two voltages @xmath163 and @xmath164 are applied .",

    "the full equation is evaluated in the following way to calibrate @xmath165 with respect to the output of the two cpw resonators for each measurement line 1 and 2 and for each mode a and b. we evaluate the integrals within a bandwidth @xmath166 which covers the two peaks in @xmath167 $ ] around @xmath137 and @xmath138  ghz , whereas @xmath168  mhz which is to good approximation the bandwidth of all four passive bandpass filters we have employed for the correlation measurements . in this bandwidth we assume that @xmath165 does not change significantly so that we can pull this term out of the left integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : calibtn ] ) .",
    "then we finally obtain four noise temperatures quantifying @xmath165 for each measurement line and mode .",
    "we then verify our calibration by taking our shot noise data and calculate the signal noise temperatures @xmath169 for the same mode but for the two distinct measurement lines 1 and 2. we find that the two calibrations match with an uncertainty of only 5% or better .",
    "figure  [ fig : excesst ] finally summarizes our calibration procedure and shows the non - integrated equation ( [ eq : calibtn ] ) , suggesting that our assumption of a constant noise temperature within a 700  mhz bandwidth around @xmath137 and @xmath138  ghz is well justified .",
    "we first measure the power emitted by the sample @xmath170 using a square wave modulation on the voltage across the josephson junction , as discussed above .",
    "after a few seconds the measurement of @xmath170 is finished and we measure the correlator @xmath136 which takes another few seconds .",
    "we verify that within this short measurement time the output power of the experiment is stable . for the measurement of the power - power fluctuations",
    "correlator we switch off the bias voltage modulation , previously used to measure @xmath149 with the lock - in amplifier , and bias the josephson junction now with a constant voltage .",
    "power fluctuations are measured by the measurement circuit behind the -3db splitter represented in fig.[fig : correlationsetup ] not used for the average power measurement .",

    "first of all our microwave measurement setup is built in such a way to keep the physical microwave line length almost equal , having in mind that a difference in length of about 10  cm corresponds to a time shift of 0.5  ns .",
    "further balancing of the physical line length is performed electronically by shifting the acquired time bins on the acquisition card . for this calibration",
    "we usually conduct a measurement of the time resolved shot noise correlation at 4.9 or 6.7  ghz where we determine the exact position of the maximum of @xmath136 , corresponding to @xmath171 between the two measurement lines .    since the acquisition card measures the incoming power fluctuations in units of _ square digits _",

    "<S> , we collect the photons leaking out into the measurement lines . at the resonator outputs , the three functions @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the propagating field operators , are simply equal to @xmath65 inside the resonators . both propagating fields @xmath66 and @xmath67 are then beam - splitted and sent to lines 1 and 2 , which include @xmath68  mhz - wide filters centered around @xmath69 and @xmath70 to select the desired resonator contributions . measuring the output powers @xmath71 and @xmath72 using two herotek dtm 180aa fast quadratic detectors with a @xmath73  ns response time @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the correlation functions @xmath74 where @xmath75 are the average sample contributions and @xmath76 are the power fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this strategy is that it gives access to the fluctuations of the power emitted by the sample avoiding parasitic terms due to the much higher noise power of the hemt amplifiers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : g2nrf ] shows the three coherence functions @xmath65 at zero delay @xmath77 as well as the noise reduction factor @xmath78 , as a function of the photon pair emission rate @xmath79 , the later being varied by scanning the flux threading the squid loop . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows that inequality ( [ cs ] ) is indeed violated for photon emission rates up to @xmath80 photon pairs per second , the @xmath78 remaining close to 0.7 . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of @xmath81 due to the independent resonator leakage is shown in the inset .    to compare our measurements with theory , we compute the @xmath82 functions . </S>",
    "<S> this task goes beyond the framework of the standard dynamical coulomb blockade theory , which assumes that the electromagnetic environment of the junction remains in equilibrium . here instead we need to predict how the presence of photons already emitted in the resonators modifies the next emission process . to do so </S>",

    "<S> the bessel functions of the first kind @xmath90  dress  the elementary photon pair creation process @xmath91 by higher - order corrections in @xmath92 . note that for low photon numbers @xmath92 and for low impedances @xmath93 , @xmath94 reduces to @xmath95 which suffices to qualitatively explain the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> photon leakage from the resonators can be accounted for by including damping rates @xmath96 of standard quantum - optical form ( in the @xmath97 limit ) in the quantum master equation of the system , @xmath98+\\sum_{\\alpha = a , b}\\kappa_\\alpha\\left(2 \\alpha \\rho \\alpha^{\\dagger}-\\alpha^{\\dagger}\\alpha\\rho-\\rho \\alpha^{\\dagger}\\alpha\\right).\\ ] ] additional incoherent dynamics of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 modes is caused by the parasitic low frequency mode @xmath35 @xcite and broadens the one - photon resonances . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that it has little impact on the two photon @xmath15-@xmath16 resonance .    simulating ( [ lindblad ] ) yields @xmath99 and hence all @xmath100 functions . </S>",
    "<S> these functions , convoluted with the @xmath73  ns detector response mentioned above , are plotted as lines in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> note that the deviation from nrf=1/2 seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : g2nrf ] is almost only due to this finite response time .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we have shown that a dc - biased josephson junction in series with two resonators provides a simple and bright source of non - classical radiation , displaying relative fluctuations of the populations of the two modes below the classical limit . </S>",
    "<S> we have also presented a theory which quantitatively accounts for our experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> while the present experiment is performed at microwave frequencies using aluminum josephson junctions , the physics involved here can be transposed to higher gap superconductors , such as nbtin or even ybacuo , opening the possibility of creating non classical thz radiations . </S>",
