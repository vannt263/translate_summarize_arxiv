    "it is well - known that the 4% difference in the experimental observed lattice constants between bulk si and bulk ge gives rise to a significant strain in the growth of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys , and the relaxation of the strain causes changes both in the local geometric structure and in the electronic structure of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys as compared to those of pure si and ge . in order to understand the mechanism of the strain relaxation , extensive experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite efforts have been devoted to the study of the interplay between the relaxation of the strain and the changes in local geometric and electronic structures .",
    "most experiments @xcite found that the lattice constant as a function of the composition does not follow an exact linear relation such as the one given by the vegard s model @xcite but has a negative deviation from the vegard s law .",
    "the bond lengths , on the other hand , show a weak composition dependence @xcite .",
    "but they do not obey the pauling model @xcite in which the bond length between a pair of atoms is independent of composition , and the steric strain in the alloys is accommodated by bond - angle changes .",
    "a number of theoretical studies have been devoted to the local structural analysis of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys at an empirical or at the semi - empirical level .",
    "weidmann and newman @xcite by minimizing a model strain energy function found that the bond lengths between si - si , si - ge , and ge - ge pairs as a function of composition are straight lines and parallel to each other .",
    "similar result were also obtained by ichimura _",
    "_ @xcite and gironcoli _ et al .",
    "alternatively , thorpe and co - workers @xcite proposed a simplified model on the basis of macroscopic elastic properties .",
    "the composition dependence of the bond lengths is described via a topological rigidity parameter @xmath3 which leads to the vegard limit when @xmath3=0 and to the pauling limit when @xmath3=1 . according to their model",
    ", @xmath3 should be 0.707 for sige alloys , and a plot of the si - si , si - ge , and ge - ge bond lengths versus composition should consist of three equally spaced parallel lines having a slope that is directly related to the value of @xmath3 .    these previous theoretical studies , while attempting to provide the insight into how the local structural properties accommodate the relaxation of the strain , failed to predict the weak dependence of the bond lengths of si - si , si - ge , and ge - ge on the composition .",
    "they also did not reproduce the negative deviation of the lattice constant from the vegard s law .",
    "for example , the result given in ref .",
    "@xcite predicted a linear dependence on the composition for the lattice constant while the result by a monte carlo simulation @xcite yielded a positive deviation from vegard s law .",
    "another monte carlo study using a statistical - mechanical model @xcite also obtained an overall linear dependence of the lattice parameter on the composition , but with a hint of negative deviation from vegard s law in the vicinity of @xmath4 .",
    "an effort to resolve these issues had been carried out by shen _",
    "@xcite , using a semi - empirical tight - binding method in the dilute limit .",
    "the model described reasonably well the behavior of the lattice constant and the properties of bond lengths in this dilute limit .",
    "however , no attempt was made to correlate the model of strain relaxation and the local properties in this study .",
    "very recently , a more accurate experimental measurement of the local structure at all compositions has been reported by aubry _",
    "they analyzed the k - edge x - ray absorption fine structure ( xafs ) spectra of si and ge in strained and relaxed si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys .",
    "they found that the si - si , si - ge , and ge - ge first - shell distances show a weak dependence on the composition .",
    "the slopes of the linear fits to the bond lengths as a function of the composition are demonstrably different from each other @xcite .",
    "this result is different from the previous theoretical predictions .",
    "they also confirmed from the composition dependence of the coordination numbers that the si and ge atoms are likely to be randomly occupying the sites and are fully miscible at all compositions .",
    "an accurate theoretical determination of equilibrium configurations of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys with no parametric input is highly desirable .",
    "this is because such a determination can help to clarify issues related to the whole spectrum of available experimental observations .",
    "furthermore , it can shed light on the interplay between the effects of strain relaxation and local properties of the alloys . in this work ,",
    "we have used the _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics scheme , as developed by sankey and co - workers @xcite , to carry out the energy minimization for the determination of the equilibrium structures of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys at various compositions .",
    "a brief outline of this method is given in section ii .",
    "we then conducted a local analysis of the structural ( section iii ) as well as electronic properties ( section iv ) of the relaxed configurations .",
    "corresponding to each composition , we have computed the optimized lattice constant , bond lengths , coordination numbers , and pair - correlation functions ( radial and angular ) .",
    "the results of these calculations are used to identify the mechanisms for strain release and to explain succinctly the origin of vegard s law as well as the deviation from this law for @xmath2 in the vicinity of 0.5 .",
    "the conclusions drawn from this work are given in section v.",
    "the _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics scheme employed in the present work is based on the density - functional theory ( dft ) in the local - density approximation ( lda ) , as developed by sankey and co - workers @xcite , where a local basis set is used to construct the kohn - sham orbitals .",
    "these basis functions are slightly excited pseudo - atomic orbitals ( pao ) .",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals are calculated self - consistently using the hamann - schlter - chiang pseudo - potentials @xcite and the ceperley - alder form of the exchange - correlation potential , as parameterized by perdew and zunger @xcite .",
    "the use of paos as basis set is extremely convenient in studies which require extracting information about local structural and electronic properties of complex systems such as si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys . for complex systems with reduced symmetry , the computational performance of this method as far as the cpu time is concerned is better than other _",
    "ab initio _ methods based on plane - wave basis sets .    in our simulation , @xmath5-type paos were used with confinement radii of 5.0 @xmath6 and 5.2 @xmath6 for si and ge atoms , respectively . the initial network chosen",
    "has a tetrahedral symmetry with 216 atoms in a cubic unit cell . for a given volume and composition",
    ", the network was fully relaxed by the dynamical quenching method using the quantum - molecular dynamics scheme cited above .",
    "the equilibrium configuration was considered to have been reached when the force on each atom is less than @xmath7 ev /  .",
    "we evaluated the total energy convergence by using both 1 and 8 special @xmath8 points in the bz and found that the result of using 8 @xmath8 points only improves the accuracy by @xmath9ev .",
    "therefore , we adopted the @xmath10 point calculation in the ensuing simulations .",
    "the volume optimization was carried out by minimizing the total energy with respect to the lattice constant for a given composition .",
    "we then conducted a local analysis of the structural and electronic properties corresponding to each composition .",
    "two types of configuration models were considered in our simulation . the first type is referred as a _ regular _ type . in this model , the sites in the supercell",
    "are first labeled sequentially in a certain order from site 1 to site @xmath11 where @xmath11 is the total number of atoms in the supercell .",
    "the assignments of si and ge atoms at the sites are carried out in a regular pattern according to their concentrations from site 1 through site @xmath11 .",
    "for example , in the case of si@xmath12ge@xmath13 , the assignment of si and ge atoms at a given site proceeds following the rule of one ge atom after every three si atoms .",
    "the second type is referred as _ random _ in which the si and ge atoms are ( completely ) randomly distributed .",
    "we found that the total energy difference between these two cases is quite small ( within the error bar ) , but the coordination numbers as a function of the composition are quite different as shown in fig .",
    "it is found that the _ regular _ type ( open symbols ) can not explain the experimental result @xcite ( see the inset ) , but the _ random _ type ( solid symbols ) mimics the experimental result very well .",
    "we therefore concentrated on the _ random _ type hereafter in our local structural analysis and in the comparison with the experimental results .",
    "other details of results shown in fig . 1 will be discussed later after we introduce the relevant definitions .",
    "we examined the global and local structural properties of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys at various compositions ( @xmath14 and 1.0 ) .",
    "figure 2 presents the optimized lattice constant versus the composition obtained from the total energy minimization .",
    "we found that the lattice constant ( solid circle ) monotonously increases from 5.513 @xmath15 at @xmath2=0 ( corresponding to pure si ) to 5.645 @xmath15 at @xmath2=1 ( corresponding to pure ge ) with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "it exhibits a negative deviation from the linear vegard s law ( dashed line ) .",
    "the deviation appears from @xmath16 , shows the largest deviation around @xmath17 , and then gradually disappears beyond @xmath18 , in good agreement with experimental results @xcite ( see the inset ) .",
    "it should be noted that , while the experimental value of the mismatch between bulk si and bulk ge is about 4% , our optimization yields a mismatch of only about 2.4 % .",
    "therefore , we present the experimental data of ref .",
    "@xcite in the inset rather than in the same figure .",
    "our goal is to compare the trend and the general pattern of the structural changes as a function of concentration so as to deduce an understanding of the strain relaxation mechanisms in si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys .",
    "the average bond - length between a pair of atoms of types @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , is defined as : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the type of atom , @xmath24 is the total number of @xmath19-type atom in the supercell , @xmath25 the distance between the @xmath19-type atom at the @xmath26th site and the @xmath20-type atom at the @xmath27th site , and @xmath28 the number of neighboring @xmath20-type atoms around the @xmath19-type atom at the @xmath26th site within the cutoff radius of @xmath29 .",
    "we took @xmath29 to be 2.7 @xmath15 in our analysis which is between the first and the second peaks of the radial - pair distribution function of the relaxed alloy configurations .",
    "we examined the choice of @xmath29 in the region of 2.6 - 3.2 @xmath15 and found that the value does not have much influence on the results because the first and the second peaks are well separated by about 1  .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the calculated average bond - lengths of si - si , si - ge , and ge - ge pairs versus the composition @xmath2 .",
    "the experimental data @xcite are presented in the inset .",
    "the experimental error bars in ref .",
    "@xcite have not been shown in the inset because we are only concerned with comparing the trend exhibited by the theoretical result with that from the experimental data .",
    "the largest error bar for si - si bond length in si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys occurs at @xmath30 while that for ge - ge bond length at @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "these occurrences had been attributed to the distortions associated with possible compound formation at these concentration @xcite .",
    "if the data points at these two concentrations are ignored , the agreement between the trend exhibited by our theoretical calculation and that shown by the experimental result is indeed very good .",
    "turning now to the theoretical result , it can be seen that the variation of both sets of bond lengths ( si - si and ge - ge ) with respect to @xmath2 follows the same general pattern .",
    "overall , the bond lengths are rather insensitive to the composition . for the si - si pairs ,",
    "the increase in their average bond - length is concentrated in the ge - rich region while for the ge - ge pairs , the decrease in their average bond - length is mostly in the si - rich region .",
    "the si - ge pairs appear to form at a distance close to the mean value of the average bond - lengths of si - si and ge - ge pairs for a given composition .",
    "the weak dependence of the average bond - lengths of si - si and ge - ge pairs on the composition indicate that the si - si and ge - ge pairs prefer to maintain their respective bond - length even in the alloying situation .",
    "the preference of the si - ge pairs to form at distances close to the mean value of the average bond - lengths of si - si and ge - ge pairs is an indication that the mismatch between lattice constants of bulk si and bulk ge is accommodated by the formation of the si - ge bond .",
    "it should be noted that the bond lengths vs the composition curves for si - si , si - ge , and ge - ge bonds obtained in the present calculation do not correspond to equally spaced parallel lines as obtained by previous calculations @xcite .",
    "they are , however , consistent with the experimental result ( see the inset of fig .",
    "3 ) as discussed above .",
    "it should also be noted that the calculated average bond - length of si - si pairs for bulk si is 2.39  , somewhat longer than the experimental value of 2.35 @xmath15 while the calculated average bond - length of ge - ge pairs for bulk ge is 2.44  , somewhat shorter than the experimental value of 2.45 @xcite .",
    "thus the spread of the variation of the calculated average bond - lengths versus the composition is narrower than that of the corresponding experimentally observed bond lengths .",
    "the coordination numbers versus the composition are presented in fig .",
    "1 . note that the coordination numbers are defined as @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , where @xmath11 is the total number of atoms , @xmath34 the number of neighbors of the @xmath26th atom , and @xmath35 are the total number of the @xmath19-type atom having @xmath20-type atoms as its neighbors within the cutoff @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that @xmath37 in the four - fold bonding structure such as tetrahedral symmetry systems , and @xmath38 when there is only one @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) atom in the @xmath20 ( @xmath19 ) atom system .",
    "if @xmath19 and @xmath20 atoms are randomly distributed , there must be no significant difference among @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 at @xmath17 .",
    "the coordination numbers of the _ random _ type clearly show such a behavior as can be seen in fig . 1 and our results are consistent with the recent experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "thus , our results support the notion that si and ge atoms randomly occupy the sites and are fully miscible in si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys because of their similar chemical properties .",
    "we next analyze how the local structure changes due to the strain relaxation .",
    "the radial - strain relaxation can be analyzed from the radial - pair distribution function @xmath43 for an @xmath19-type atom at the origin and a @xmath20-type atom at a distance @xmath44 away .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the total radial - pair distribution function @xmath45 ( solid curve ) in the region of the first - shell distance consists of three sub - peaks : the si - si peak on the left side , the si - ge in the middle , and the ge - ge on the right side ( note that these sub - peaks can be clearly distinguished at @xmath2=0.4 , 0.5 , and 0.6 ) .",
    "such peak positions shift less than 0.5% from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , indicating that during the strain relaxation all the pairs of si - si , si - ge , and ge - ge prefer to be as close to their equilibrium distances as possible .",
    "it can also be seen that the 2% shift of the peak position of the average first - shell distance is attributed to the change of the ratio among the si - si , si - ge , and ge - ge pairs in the mixture .",
    "this explains the monotonous increase of the lattice constant with increasing ge composition .",
    "furthermore , the average overall bond - length of all three types of bonds has been plotted versus the composition in fig .",
    "3 . it shows a linear dependence on the composition .",
    "hence the strain release through the radial stretching is apparently responsible for the overall trend of linear dependence of the lattice constant on @xmath2 .",
    "the question is then how does the lattice constant versus @xmath2 curve exhibit a negative deviation from vegard s law ?",
    "specifically , how does the mismatch between the lattice constants of bulk si and bulk ge manifest itself when si - si and ge - ge pairs prefer to maintain their respective lengths ? to answer this question , we examined the bond - angle strain relaxation from the bond - angle distribution function @xmath48 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "5 that the peak of the bond - angle distribution is sharp at pure limits and broad at or close to the maximum mixing case ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this is an indication that there are large bond - angle distortion where the strain is largest . to understand in more detail how the angular strain affects the local structure",
    ", we plotted the 8 partial bond - angle distribution functions @xmath49 at @xmath50 and 0.75 , respectively as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath49 gives the angular distribution for the angle @xmath51 between two bonds @xmath52 and @xmath53 . from fig .",
    "6 , we found that all the partial bond - angle distribution functions @xmath49 have their peaks centered around the tetrahedral angle ( @xmath54 ) . but both the magnitude and the position of the peaks change as the composition changes and hence so do their contributions to the total bond - angle distribution function @xmath48 .",
    "for example , @xmath55 contributes the most to the total bond - angle distribution function @xmath48 in the case of @xmath56 .",
    "the magnitude of its peak shows a monotonical decrease as @xmath2 increases towards the ge - rich region .",
    "simultaneously , the position of its peak shifts from @xmath57 at @xmath56 to @xmath58 at @xmath18 . on the other hand , the magnitude of the peak of @xmath59 decreases monotonically as @xmath2 decreases towards the si - rich region while the position of the peak shifts from @xmath60 at @xmath18 to @xmath61 at @xmath56 . in the vicinity of @xmath17 , however , all of the partial bond - angle distribution functions @xmath49 contribute to the total bond - angle distribution function @xmath48 with comparable weights .",
    "an interesting feature is that the average bond - angles always keep in the order of @xmath62 , independent of the composition ( see fig .",
    "in particular , it is found that the deviations of @xmath63 ( solid circles ) and @xmath64 ( solid squares ) from the tetrahedral angle are always positive while those of @xmath65 ( open circles ) and @xmath66 ( open squares ) always negative .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the average bond - angle @xmath67 ( @xmath64 ) between two si - si bonds ( two ge - si bonds ) depends on how the lattice constant of the si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys at a certain composition @xmath2 compares with that of bulk si .",
    "since the lattice constant of the alloy is always greater than that of the bulk si and it increases with increasing @xmath2 , the average bond - angle @xmath67 ( @xmath64 ) will therefore always be greater than the overall average bond - angle ( almost identical to the tetrahedral angle of 109.47@xmath68 ) and increases with increasing @xmath2 ( see , fig .",
    "7 ) . hence , a positive angular deviation of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) from the overall average bond - angle results and this angular deviation increases with increasing @xmath2 ( towards the ge - rich region )",
    ". by the same token ,",
    "since the lattice constant of the alloy is always less than that of bulk ge , the average bond - angle @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) will always be less than the overall average bond - angle and decreases with decreasing @xmath2 .",
    "thus , a negative angular deviation from the average bond - angle results for the average bond - angle @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) and this negative deviation decreases with decreasing @xmath2 ( towards the si - rich region ) .",
    "this scenario also indicates that the largest positive angular deviation for @xmath67 and @xmath69 ( of the order of 1@xmath68 ) occurs in the ge - rich region ( large @xmath2 ) while the largest negative angular deviation for @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath70 1@xmath68 ) occurs in the si - rich region ( small @xmath2 ) .",
    "but , because the partial bond - angle distribution function @xmath55 ( @xmath71 ) is insignificant in the ge - rich region and @xmath59 ( @xmath72 ) is insignificant in the si - rich region , the large positive angular deviation of @xmath67 ( @xmath64 ) and the large negative angular deviation of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) will not manifest themselves in any significant way in the release of strain .",
    "however , in the neighborhood of @xmath17 , both the positive angular deviation of @xmath67 ( @xmath64 ) and the negative angular deviation of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) are still substantial ( @xmath73 ) while their respective partial bond - angle distribution functions all make significant contributions to the total bond - angle distribution .    a closer examination of figs .",
    "6 and 7 reveals that in the vicinity of @xmath17 , the magnitudes of the negative angular deviations of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are greater than or comparable to the positive angular deviations of @xmath67 and @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , the magnitudes of the peaks of the partial bond - angle distribution functions @xmath59 and @xmath72 are greater than those of @xmath55 and @xmath74 .",
    "the combination of those effects leads to the situation where the negative angular deviations outweigh the positive angular deviations .",
    "a net negative angular deviation in the bond - angle manifests itself in the reduction of the lattice constant .",
    "hence , in the vicinity of @xmath17 , it is the bond angle relaxation that leads to the negative deviation from vegard s law in the lattice constant .",
    "based on the local structural analysis , we have established how the local structure changes and how these changes are the result of the accommodation to the strain relaxation . even though si - si , si - ge , and ge - ge pairs in the alloys prefer to maintain their respective bond lengths so that their respective bond lengths are , for the most part , insensitive to the change in the composition , the average overall bond - length nevertheless shows a linear dependence on the composition .",
    "the strain relaxation can therefore be separated into two parts : the radial relaxation and the angular relaxation .",
    "the former is responsible for the general trend of a linear dependence on the composition , and the latter is responsible for the negative deviation in the lattice constant in the vicinity of @xmath17 .",
    "having identified the mechanism for the strain release associated with the lattice mismatch and established the link between the local structural changes and the mechanisms for the strain release , it would be illuminating if one can gain an understanding of the interplay among the local electronic structure , local structural changes , and the strain - relaxation .",
    "for this purpose , we conducted a local analysis of the electronic structure for si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys , using the approach developed in ref .",
    "the analysis was carried out in the framework of the @xmath5 basis set used in the _ab initio_ molecular dynamics scheme . in tables i and ii , we list the local electron distributions ( the on - site orbital electrons , the bond electrons , and the total site electrons ) for two alloy configurations corresponding to @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "specifically , for each of these configurations , we present the results for local electron distributions in two regions : ( a ) one in the vicinity of an impurity atom and ( b ) in the vicinity of a host atom ( which is at least beyond the second nearest neighbors of the impurity atom ) . in table i ( corresponding to a si - rich configuration with @xmath77 ) , the local electron distributions in the region surrounding a ge impurity at site 1 with 4 nearest neighbor si atoms at sites 5 , 70 , 167 , and 200 , respectively and those in the region , away from the impurity at site 1 , surrounding a host si atom at site 213 with 4 nearest neighbor si atoms at sites 209 , 210 , 211 , and 212 are given .",
    "from table i , it is seen that the charge transfer occurs between the ge impurity atom and its 4 nearest neighbor si atoms in the region surrounding the impurity while there is no significant charge transfer amongst the si atom and its neighbors in the region away from the immediate neighborhood of the impurity . from the results shown in tables",
    "i and ii , it can be seen that the electron transfer always occurs from the si atom to the ge atom as expected because of the higher electro - negativity of the ge atom with respect to the si atom .",
    "for example , each of the 4 nearest neighbor si atoms transfers about 0.017e to the impurity ge atom at the center , leading to a gain of about 0.066e for the ge impurity atom .",
    "the transfer of the electrons comes mostly from the si @xmath78-orbitals to ge @xmath78-orbitals , with the remainder contributing to the enhancement of the bond charge for the formation of ge - si bond , as can be seen from the results shown both in table i ( @xmath2=0.1 , si - rich configuration ) and table ii ( @xmath2= 0.9 , ge - rich configuration ) . for the ge - rich configuration ,",
    "the charge transfers again are mainly concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the impurity ( si ) .",
    "for example , it can be seen from table ii that 0.065e are transfered from the impurity si atom ( at site 29 ) to its 4 nearest neighbor ge atoms ( at sites 25 , 26 , 27 , and 28 , respectively ) , each gaining on the average about 0.016e . in the region",
    "away from the immediate neighborhood of the impurity si atom , there is hardly any charge transfer between the host ge atom at site 45 ( center ) and its 4 nearest neighbor host ge atoms ( at sites 41 , 42 , 43 , and 44 , respectively ) . from table",
    "i , one obtains the average bond charge for a pair of si - si bond to be about 0.62e . from table ii ,",
    "one obtains the average bond charge for a pair of ge - ge bond to be about 0.58e . from table",
    "i and ii , one obtains the average bond charge for a si - ge bond to be about 0.60e .",
    "thus the sequence of average bond charges follows the order @xmath79 , providing the electronic basis for the observation of average bond - lengths in the order of @xmath80 ( see section iii ) .",
    "our local analysis also finds that the average bond charges for the ge - ge , ge - si , and si - si pairs show weak dependence on the composition .",
    "however , the overall average bond charge shows a general trend of linear dependence on the composition .",
    "these results provide the electronic basis for the relationships established for various average bond - lengths in the structural analysis given in section iii .",
    "in conclusion , our _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics study of si@xmath81ge@xmath82 alloys provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the strain relaxation associated with the lattice mismatch and the changes in the local structural and electronic properties .",
    "we find that si and ge atoms do not have a strong preference to form either the si - si or the ge - ge pair but are fully miscible in the si@xmath81ge@xmath82 alloys because of the similar chemical properties . in the relaxation process ,",
    "most of the si - si and ge - ge pairs try to maintain their equilibrium distances corresponding to their pure limits , leading to a weak dependence of the average bond length for si - si , si - ge , and ge - ge pairs on the composition . however ,",
    "the overall average bond - length does show a linear dependence on the composition ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , indicating that the radial - relaxation is mainly responsible for the general trend of a linear dependence of the lattice constant on the composition . on the other hand ,",
    "the bond - angle - relaxation in the vicinity of @xmath17 has been shown to be responsible for the negative deviation of the lattice constant from the vegard s law .",

    "<S> in this work , we address issues pertinent to the understanding of the structural and electronic properties of si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys , namely , ( i ) how does the lattice constant mismatch between bulk si and bulk ge manifests itself in the alloy system ? and ( ii ) what are the relevant strain release mechanisms ? to provide answers to these questions , we have carried out an in - depth study of the changes in the local geometric and electronic structures arising from the strain relaxation in si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys . </S>",
    "<S> we first compute the optimized lattice constant for different compositions ( @xmath2 ) by fully relaxing the system and by minimizing the total energy with respect to the lattice constant at each composition , using an _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the optimized lattice constant , while exhibiting a general trend of linear dependence on the composition ( vegard s law ) , shows a negative deviation from vegard s law in the vicinity of @xmath2=0.5 . </S>",
    "<S> we delineate the mechanisms responsible for each one of the above features . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the radial - strain relaxation through bond stretching is responsible for the overall trend of linear dependence of the lattice constant on the composition . on the other hand , the negative deviation from vegard s law is shown to arise from the angular - strain relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , the combined effect of the local bond - angle deviations from the tetrahedral angle and the magnitudes of the corresponding peaks for the partial - angle distribution function determines the negative deviation from vegard s law . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic origin of the changes in the local geometric structure due to strain relaxation is also presented in this work . in particular , the correlation between the bond charges and the bond - lengths for si - si , ge - ge , and si - ge pairs in si@xmath0ge@xmath1 alloys for different compositions is explicitly shown . </S>",
    "<S> our calculation of the average coordination number as a function of composition indicates a random occupation of si and ge on the lattice sites , suggesting that si and ge atoms are fully miscible in the alloy system . </S>"
