    "mass transfer between components of close binaries is a common evolutionary phase for many astrophysically interesting binary systems .",
    "indeed , mass ejection and/or accretion is responsible for many of the most recognizable phenomena associated with close binaries , such as persistent or transient x - ray emission , neutron star spin - up , and orbital contraction or expansion .",
    "theoretical considerations of these and other associated phenomena in the literature probe these systems quite effectively , yet they often do not consider the effects of any eccentricity associated with the binary orbit",
    ". this can be of particular importance for binaries containing a neutron star or a black hole , where mass loss and natal kicks occurring during compact object formation may induce a significant eccentricity to the binary ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after the formation of the compact object , tides tend to circularize the orbit on a timescale which strongly depends on the ratio of the radius of the compact object s companion to the orbital semi - major axis . because of this , orbits are usually assumed to circularize instantaneously when a binary approaches or begins a mass transfer phase .    despite our generally well developed understanding of tidal interactions in close binaries , quantitative uncertainties in tidal dissipation mechanisms propagate into the determination of circularization timescales .",
    "for example , @xcite have shown that current theories of tidal circularization can not explain observed degrees of circularization of solar - type binaries in open clusters .",
    "circularization of high - mass binaries , on the other hand , is currently thought to be driven predominantly by resonances between dynamic tides and free oscillation modes , but initial conditions play an important role and an extensive computational survey of relevant parts of the initial parameter space has yet to be undertaken @xcite .",
    "furthermore , assumptions of instantaneous circularization immediately before or at the onset of mass transfer are in clear contrast with observations of eccentric mass transferring systems . in the most recent catalog of eccentric binaries with known apsidal - motion rates compiled by @xcite , 26 out of the 128 listed systems are semi - detached or contact binaries . among these mass - transferring systems ,",
    "@xmath1 have measured eccentricities greater than @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , many high - mass x - ray binaries are known to have considerable orbital eccentricities @xcite .",
    "while mass transfer in these systems is generally thought to be driven by the stellar wind of a massive o- or b - star , it has been suggested that some of them may also be subjected to atmospheric roche - lobe overflow at each periastron passage of the massive donor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite were the first to study the effects of mass transfer on the orbital elements of eccentric binaries .",
    "however , their treatment was restricted to perturbations of the orbital motion caused by the variable component masses .",
    "@xcite extended these early pioneering studies to include the effects of linear momentum transport from one star to the other , as well as any other possible perturbations caused by the mass transfer stream in the system .",
    "however , these authors derived the equations governing the motion of the binary components with respect to a reference frame with origin at the mass center of the binary , which is not an inertial frame .",
    "their equations therefore do not account for the accelerations of the binary mass center caused by the mass transfer ( see   [ sec - appb ] ) .",
    "more recent work on mass transfer in eccentric binaries has mainly focused on smoothed particle hydrodynamics calculations of the mass transfer stream over the course of a few orbits , without any consideration of the long - term evolution of the binary @xcite .",
    "hence , there is ample observational and theoretical motivation to revisit the study of eccentric mass - transferring binaries . in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to derive the equations governing the evolution of the orbital semi - major axis and eccentricity in eccentric mass - transferring binaries , assuming conservation of total system mass and orbital angular momentum . in a subsequent paper",
    ", we will incorporate the effects of mass and orbital angular momentum losses from the system .",
    "our analysis is based on the seminal work of @xcite who was the first to derive the equations of motion of the components of eccentric mass - transferring binaries while properly accounting for the effects of the variable component masses on the stars mutual gravitational attraction , the transport of linear momentum from one star to the other , the accelerations of the binary mass center due to the redistribution of mass in the system , and the perturbations of the orbital motion caused by the mass - transfer stream . while the equations of motion derived by @xcite are valid for orbits of arbitrary eccentricity , the author restricted the derivation of the equations governing the evolution of the semi - major axis and eccentricity to orbits with small initial eccentricities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 and  3 we present the basic assumptions relevant to the investigation and derive the equations governing the motion of the components of an eccentric mass - transferring binary under the assumption of conservative mass transfer .",
    "the associated equations governing the rates of change of the semi - major axis and the orbital eccentricity are derived in  4 , while numerical results for the timescales of orbital evolution due to mass transfer as a function of the initial binary mass ratio and orbital eccentricity are presented in  5 . for comparison ,",
    "timescales of orbital evolution due to dissipative tidal interactions between the binary components are presented in  6 .",
    " 7 is devoted to a summary of our main results and a discussion of future work . in the appendices ,",
    "lastly , we derive an equation for the position of the inner lagrangian point in eccentric binaries with non - synchronously rotating component stars ( appendix  [ sec - appa ] ) , and present an alternative derivation for the equations governing the secular evolution of the orbital semi - major axis and eccentricity assuming instantaneous mass transfer between two point masses ( appendix  [ sec - appc ] ) .",
    "we consider a binary system consisting of two stars in an eccentric orbit with period @xmath3 , semi - major axis @xmath4 , and eccentricity @xmath5 .",
    "we let the component stars rotate with angular velocities @xmath6 and @xmath7 parallel to the orbital angular velocity @xmath8 , and assume the rotation rates to be uniform throughout the stars",
    ". we also note that the magnitude of @xmath8 varies periodically in time for eccentric binaries , but its direction remains fixed in space . because of this , the stars can not be synchronized with the orbital motion at all times .    at some time @xmath9 ,",
    "one of the stars is assumed to fill its roche lobe and begins transferring mass to its companion through the inner lagrangian point @xmath10 .",
    "we assume this point to lie on the line connecting the mass centers of the stars , even though non - synchronous rotation may cause it to oscillate in the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane with an amplitude proportional to the degree of asynchronism @xcite .",
    "since the donor s rotation axis is assumed to be parallel to the orbital angular velocity , we can safely assume that the transferred mass remains confined to the orbital plane .",
    "we furthermore assume that all mass lost from the donor is accreted by its companion , and that any orbital angular momentum transported by the transferred mass is immediately returned to the orbit .",
    "the mass transfer thus conserves both the total system mass and the orbital angular momentum .",
    "we also neglect any perturbations to the orbital motion other than those due to mass transfer . at the lowest order of approximation ,",
    "these additional perturbations ( e.g. , due to tides , magnetic breaking , or gravitational radiation ) are decoupled from those due to mass transfer , and can thus simply be added to obtain the total rates of secular change of the orbital elements .",
    "following @xcite , we derive the equations of motion of the components of an eccentric mass - transferring binary with respect to a right handed inertial frame of reference @xmath11 which has an arbitrary position and orientation in space ( see fig .  [ fig - coords ] ) .",
    "we let @xmath12 be the mass of star @xmath13 at some time @xmath9 at which mass is transferred from the donor to the accretor , and @xmath14 the mass of the same star at some time @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a small time interval . with these notations",
    ", @xmath17 corresponds to mass loss , and @xmath18 to mass accretion .",

    ", @xmath19 corresponds to the inner lagrangian point @xmath10 , while for the accretor , @xmath19 can be any point on the star s equator . for the remainder of the paper ,",
    "we let @xmath20 correspond to the donor and @xmath21 to the accretor .",
    "because of the mass loss / gain , the center of mass of star @xmath13 at time @xmath22 is shifted from where it would have been had no mass transfer taken place . to describe this perturbation",
    ", we introduce an additional right - handed coordinate frame @xmath23 with a spatial velocity such that its origin follows the unperturbed orbit of star @xmath13 , i.e. , the origin of @xmath24 follows the path the center of mass of star @xmath13 would have taken had no mass transfer occurred .",
    "thus , at time @xmath9 , the center of mass of star @xmath13 lies at the origin of @xmath25 , while at time @xmath15 it has a non - zero position vector with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "we furthermore let the @xmath26-axis of the @xmath23 frame point in the direction of the orbital angular momentum vector , and let the frame rotate synchronously with the unperturbed orbital angular velocity of the binary in the absence of mass transfer .",
    "the direction and orientation of the @xmath27-axes are then chosen such that at time @xmath9 the @xmath27-axis points along the direction from the mass center of star @xmath13 to the mass center of its companion .    to describe the shift in the mass center of star @xmath13 due to the mass loss / gain",
    ", we denote the position vector of @xmath25 at times @xmath9 and @xmath28 with respect to the inertial frame by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . the position vector of the center of mass of star @xmath13 at times @xmath9 and @xmath22 is then given by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the position vector of the center of mass of star @xmath13 at time @xmath15 with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , we denote by @xmath34 and @xmath35 the vectors from @xmath25 to the position where the point @xmath19 on the stellar surface would be at times @xmath9 and @xmath22 , respectively , had no mass been lost / accreted .",
    "the various position vectors at time @xmath22 are related by @xmath36 which , at the lowest order of approximation in @xmath37 and @xmath33 , yields @xmath38 as expected , the displacement of the center of mass of star @xmath13 due to the mass loss / gain is directed along the line connecting the center of mass of the star and the mass ejection / accretion point .",
    "we furthermore denote with @xmath39 the vector from the center of mass of star @xmath13 at time @xmath15 to the position where the point @xmath19 would be at time @xmath15 , had no mass been transferred between the binary components , and with @xmath40 the perturbation of this vector caused by the mass transfer .",

    "these authors extended the work of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite by accounting for the effects of linear momentum transport between the binary components , as well as possible perturbations to the orbital motion caused by the mass transfer stream .",
    "however , they also derived the equations describing the motion of the binary components with respect to a frame of reference with origin at the mass center of the binary , which , for mass transferring systems , is not an inertial frame of reference .",
    "the equations therefore do not account for the accelerations of the binary mass center caused by the mass transfer .",
    "here , we demonstrate that if the procedure adopted by matese & whitmire is developed with respect to an inertial frame of reference that is not connected to the binary , the resulting equations are in agreement with those derived in  [ relmot ] .",

    "while the authors choose to adopt a reference frame with origin at the binary mass center early on in the investigation , the choice of the frame does not affect the derivation of the equations of motion up to and including their equation  ( 24 ) .",

    "for a mass - transferring binary , such a frame is , however , not an inertial frame and can therefore not be used for the derivation of the equations of motion of the binary components . instead of equation  ( [ eq - apb - eqm ] ) ,",
    "matese & whitmire therefore find equations  ( 7)(8 ) in mw84 , which lack the terms associated with the acceleration of the binary mass center due to the mass transfer .",
    "in the classical framework of the theory of osculating elements , the equations governing the rate of change of the orbital semi - major axis @xmath4 and eccentricity @xmath5 due to mass transfer are obtained from the perturbing functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 as ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these equations are independent of the perturbing function @xmath93 which solely appears in the equations governing the rates of change of the orbital inclination , the longitude of the ascending node , and the longitude of the periastron .",
    "after substitution of equations  ( [ eq - s ] ) and ( [ eq - t ] ) for @xmath91 and @xmath92 into equations  ( [ eq - dadt ] ) and  ( [ eq - dedt ] ) , the equations governing the rates of change of the semi - major axis and eccentricity contain periodic as well as secular terms . here",
    "we are mainly interested in the long - term secular evolution of the orbit , and so we remove the periodic terms by averaging the equations over one orbital period : @xmath118 @xmath119 the integrals in these definitions are most conveniently computed in terms of the true anomaly , @xmath117 .",
    "we therefore make a change of variables using @xmath120 for binaries with eccentric orbits , the resulting integrals can be calculated analytically only for very specific functional prescriptions of the mass - transfer rate @xmath121 ( e.g. , when @xmath121 is approximated by a dirac delta function centered on the periastron , see  [ sec - delta ] ) . in general , the integrals must be computed numerically .",

    "as long as no mass is lost from the system , such a calculation automatically incorporates the conservation of total angular momentum in the system .",
    "special cases of angular momentum conservation can , however , be used to bypass the calculation of detailed particle trajectories . here , we adopt such a special case and assume that any orbital angular momentum carried by the particles in the mass - transfer stream is always immediately returned to the orbit , so that the orbital angular momentum of the binary is conserved .    the orbital angular momentum of a binary with a semi - major axis @xmath4 and eccentricity @xmath5 is given by @xmath122^{1/2 } , \\label{eq - j}\\ ] ] so that @xmath123 where a dot indicates the time derivative .    in the case of eccentric orbits ,",

    "in order to assess the timescales of orbital evolution due to mass transfer in eccentric binaries , we observe that , for eccentric binaries , mass transfer is expected to occur first at the periastron of the relative orbit , where the component stars are closest to each other . we therefore explore the order of magnitude of the timescales assuming a delta function mass transfer profile centered at the periastron of the binary orbit @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the instantaneous mass transfer rate , and @xmath132 is the dirac delta function .",

    "* ) . as before",
    ", we assume the donor rotates synchronously with the orbital motion at periastron and that the accretor is a @xmath198 neutron star .",
    "the timescales of orbital evolution due to tides range from a few myr to more than a hubble time , depending on the binary mass ratio and the orbital eccentricity .",
    "the discontinuity in the timescales at @xmath199 corresponds to the transition from donor stars with convective envelopes ( @xmath200 ) to donor stars with radiative envelopes ( @xmath201 ) which are subject to different tidal dissipation mechanisms .",
    "it follows that tides do not necessarily lead to rapid circularization during the early stages of mass transfer , especially for orbital eccentricities @xmath202 .",
    "furthermore , for the adopted system parameters , the orbital eccentricity always decreases , while the orbital semi - major axis can either increase or decrease .",
    "hence , in some regions of the parameter space , the effects of tides and mass transfer are additive , while in other regions they are competitive .",
    "this is illustrated in more detail in figure  [ fig - tot_timescale ] where we show the orbital evolution timescales due to the combined effect of tides and mass transfer . in the calculations of the timescales ,",
    "we have assumed that , at the lowest order of approximation , the effects of tides and mass transfer are decoupled .",
    "the total rate of change of the orbital elements is then given by the sum of the rate of change of the orbital elements due to tides and mass transfer .    when @xmath203 and @xmath204 , the effects of tides and mass transfer on the orbital semi - major axis are always opposed , with the orbital expansion due to mass transfer dominating the orbital shrinkage due to tides .",
    "in the case of the orbital eccentricity , the increase of the eccentricity due to mass transfer dominates the decrease due to tides for mass ratios smaller than some critical mass ratio which depends strongly on the orbital eccentricity . since the timescales of orbital evolution due to mass transfer are inversely proportional to the magnitude @xmath175 of the mass - transfer rate at periastron , the parameter space where and the extent to which mass transfer dominates increases with the rate of mass transfer at periastron .    in figure  [ fig - tot_contour ] ,",
    "we show the total orbital evolution timescale due to the sum of tidal and mass transfer effects as a contour plot in the @xmath182-plane .",
    "the thick black lines indicate the transitions from positive ( left of the thick black line ) to negative ( right of the thick black line ) rates of change of the semi - major axis and eccentricity .",
    "the white dividing line near @xmath205 corresponds to the transition between tidal dissipation mechanisms in stars with convective envelopes ( @xmath206 ) and stars with radiative envelopes ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "it follows that there are large regions of parameter space where the combined effects of mass transfer and tidal evolution do not rapidly circularize the orbit .",
    "in particular , for @xmath208 and @xmath209 orbital circularization always takes longer than 10gyr , while for @xmath157 to the left of the thick black line the orbital eccentricity grows rather than shrinks . for a given @xmath157 left of the thick black line , the timescales for eccentricity growth increase with increasing @xmath5 though , so that there is no runaway eccentricity growth .",
    "hence , for small @xmath157 , mass transfer at the periastron of eccentric orbits may provide a means for inducing non - negligible eccentricities in low - mass binary or planetary systems .",
    "the orbital semi - major axis , on the other hand , always increases when @xmath210 , but can increase as well as decrease when @xmath211 , depending on the binary mass ratio @xmath157 .",
    "we recall that both the tidal and mass transfer orbital evolution time scales depend on the ratio of the donor s rotational angular velocity @xmath159 to the orbital angular velocity @xmath160 and that we have set @xmath186 in all figures shown .",
    "we developed a formalism to calculate the evolution of the semi - major axis and orbital eccentricity due to mass transfer in eccentric binaries , assuming conservation of total system mass and orbital angular momentum . adopting a delta - function mass - transfer profile centered at the periastron of the binary orbit yields rates of secular change of the orbital elements that are linearly proportional to the magnitude @xmath175 of the mass - transfer rate at the periastron .",
    "for @xmath212 , this yields timescales of orbital evolution ranging from a few myr to a hubble time or longer . depending on the initial binary mass ratio and orbital eccentricity , the rates of secular change of the orbital semi - major axis and eccentricity can be positive as well as negative , so these orbital elements can increase as well as decrease with time .",
    "comparison of the timescales of orbital evolution due to mass transfer with the timescales of orbital evolution due to tidal dissipation shows that the effects can either be additive or competitive , depending on the binary mass ratio , the orbital eccentricity , and the magnitude of the mass - transfer rate at the periastron .",
    "contrary to what is often assumed in even the most state - of - the - art binary evolution and population synthesis codes , tides do not always lead to rapid circularization during the early stages of mass transfer .",
    "thus , phases of episodic mass transfer may occur at successive periastron passages and may persist for long periods of time . as a first approximation , the evolution of the orbital semi - major axis and eccentricity due to mass transfer in eccentric binaries can be incorporated into binary evolution and population synthesis codes by means of equations  ( [ eq - deltaa ] ) and ( [ eq - deltae ] ) in which the mass - transfer rate is approximated by a delta - function of amplitude @xmath175 centered at the periastron of the binary orbit .    in future papers",
    ", we will relax the assumption of conservation of total system mass and orbital angular momentum , and examine the effects of non - conservative mass transfer on the orbital elements of eccentric binaries .",
    "we also intend to study the onset of mass transfer in eccentric binaries in more detail , adopting realistic mass - transfer rates appropriate for atmospheric roche - lobe overflow in interacting binaries as discussed by @xcite",
    ". we will consider individual binary systems that are known to be eccentric and transferring mass during periastron passage , as well as populations of eccentric mass - transferring binaries and their descendants .",

    "star  1 is furthermore assumed to rotate uniformly with a constant angular velocity @xmath6 parallel to the orbital angular velocity @xmath8 .",
