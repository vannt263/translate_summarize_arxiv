    "in recent years , the formation of rarefied preplanetesimals was studied by several scientists ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * cuzzi et al .",
    "2008 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* johansen et al . 2007 , 2011 , 2012 ) ; ( * ? ?",
    "* lyra et al . 2009 ) ) . and",
    "* nesvorny et al . ( 2010 ) ) supposed that trans - neptunian binaries were formed from rarefied preplanetesimals ( rpps ) .",
    "* nesvorny et al . ( 2010 ) ) calculated contraction of rpps and formation of binaries supposing that rpps got their angular momenta when they formed from the protoplanet cloud .",
    "supposed that a considerable fraction of discovered trans - neptunian binaries could acquire most of their angular momenta at collisions of rpps .",
    "he showed that the angular momenta acquired at collisions of rpps moved before collisions in circular heliocentric orbits could have the same values as the angular momenta of discovered trans - neptunian and asteroid binaries .    in the present paper , the angular velocities used by ( * ? ? ? * nesvorny et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ) as initial data are compared with the angular velocities acquired for our model at a collision of two rpps moving in circular orbits .",
    "the frequency of collisions and mergers of collided preplanetesimals , and the formation of trans - neptunian binaries are also discussed .",
    "obtained that the angular momentum of two colliding rpps ( with radii @xmath0 and @xmath1 and masses @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) moved before the collision in circular heliocentric orbits equals @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the gravitational constant , @xmath6 is the mass of the sun , and the difference in semimajor axes @xmath7 of rpps equals @xmath8 . at @xmath9",
    ", one can obtain @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 varies from -0.5 to 1 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath12 equals 0.6 .",
    "the values of @xmath13 are positive at @xmath14 and are negative at @xmath15 .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath16 of the rpp of radius @xmath17 and mass @xmath18 formed as a result of a collision equals @xmath13/@xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the moment of inertia of a rpp , @xmath21=1 is for a uniform sphere considered by nesvorny et al .",
    "i obtained that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "as @xmath24 , then @xmath16 does not depend on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath25 if @xmath26 @xmath27const .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 will be the same at different values of @xmath28 if we consider rpps with radii @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the radius of the hill sphere for mass @xmath31 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , if at some moment of time after the collision of uniform spheres with radii @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the radius @xmath33 of a compressed sphere equals @xmath34 , then ( at @xmath21=1 ) the angular velocity of the compressed rpp is @xmath35 .",
    "below i consider @xmath0=@xmath1 , @xmath36=@xmath37 , @xmath2=@xmath3=@xmath38 , and @xmath21=1 . in this case",
    ", one has @xmath39 .",
    "* nesvorny et al . ( 2010 ) ) made computer simulations of the contraction of preplanetesimals in the trans - neptunian region .",
    "they considered initial angular velocities of preplanetesimals equal to @xmath40=@xmath41 , where @xmath42 , @xmath43 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 , and 1.25 . in",
    "most of their runs , @xmath25=@xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the hill radius of a rpp of mass @xmath32 .",
    "also @xmath25=@xmath46 and @xmath25=@xmath47 were used . note that @xmath48 .    in the case of hill spheres , considering @xmath16=@xmath40",
    ", we have @xmath49 .",
    "this relationship shows that it is possible to obtain the values of @xmath16=@xmath50 corresponding to @xmath51 up to 0.909 at collisions of rpps for @xmath52=@xmath21=1 . in the case of a collision of rpps - hill spheres and the subsequent contraction of the formed rpp to radius @xmath33 , the obtained angular velocity is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 . for this rpp with radius @xmath33 , we have @xmath55 ( where @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 . at @xmath58 , the collision of hill spheres can produce @xmath13 corresponding to @xmath51 up to @xmath59 .",
    "* nesvorny et al . ( 2010 ) ) obtained binaries or triples only at @xmath51 equal to 0.5 or 0.75 .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that the initial angular velocities of rpps that lead to formation of binaries can be obtained at collisions of rpps .",
    "note that the values of @xmath16 at the moment of a collision are the same at collisions at different values of @xmath60 , but @xmath61@xmath62@xmath63 in the case of contraction of a rpp from @xmath25 to @xmath33 .",
    "the number of collisions of rpps depends on the number of rpps in the considered region , on their initial sizes , and on the time dependences of radii of collapsing rpps .",
    "* cuzzi et al . ( 2008 ) ) obtained the `` sedimentation '' timescale for rpps to be roughly 30 - 300 orbit periods at 2.5 au for 300 @xmath64 m radius chondrules .",
    "both smaller and greater times of contraction of rpps were considered by other authors . according to ( * ? ? ? * lyra et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ) , the time of growth of mars - size planetesimals from preplanetesimals consisted of boulders took place in five orbits .",
    "it may be possible that a greater fraction of rpps had not collided with other rpps before they contracted to solid bodies . for an object with mass @xmath65 kg @xmath27 @xmath66 ( where @xmath67 is the mass of the earth ) , e.g. , for a solid object with diameter @xmath68=100 km and density @xmath69@xmath701.15 g @xmath71 , its hill radius equals @xmath72 . for circular orbits separated by this hill radius ,",
    "the ratio of periods of motion of two rpps around the sun is about @xmath73 , where @xmath74 . in this case , the angle with a vertex in the sun between the directions to the two rpps changes by @xmath75 radians during @xmath76=100 revolutions of rpps around the sun .",
    "let us consider the planar disk consisted of @xmath77 identical rpps with radii @xmath78 and masses @xmath65 kg .",
    "the ratio of the distances from the sun to the edges of the disk is supposed to be equal to @xmath79=1.67 ( e.g. , for a disk from 30 to 50 au ) . for @xmath77=@xmath80 and @xmath81 ,",
    "a rpp can collide with another rpp when their semimajor axes differ by not more than @xmath82 , i.e. , the mean number of rpps which can collide with the rpp is about @xmath83 or @xmath84 if the number of rpps is proportional to @xmath7 or @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the mean number @xmath86 of collisions of the rpp during @xmath76 revolutions around the sun can be estimated as @xmath87 . at @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath86 is proportional to @xmath91 . in calculations by nesvorny et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the binary systems formed from rpps in 100 yr ( i.e. in 0.6 of the orbital period at 30 au ) . at time equal to 0.6 of the orbital period ,",
    "the fraction of collided rpps for our above model is about 0.3 , which is in accordance with the fraction of classical trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) with satellites among discovered classical tnos .",
    "some collisions were tangent and did not result in a merger .",
    "rpps contracted with time . therefore , the real number of mergers can be smaller than that for the above estimates .",
    "densities of rpps could be very low , but their relative velocities @xmath92 at collisions were also very small . the velocities @xmath92 were smaller than the escape velocities on the edge of the hill sphere of the primary .",
    "if collided rpps are much smaller than their hill spheres , and if their heliocentric orbits are almost circular before the encounter , then the velocity of the collision does not differ much from the parabolic velocity @xmath93 at the surface of the primary rpp ( with radius @xmath94 ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath93 is proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , collisions of rpps could result in a merger ( followed by possible formation of satellites ) at any @xmath96 .",
    "* johansen et al . ( 2007 ) ) determined that the mean free path of a boulder inside a cluster ",
    "preplanetesimal is shorter than the size of the cluster .",
    "this result supports the picture of mergers of rpps . in calculations made by (",
    "* johansen et al . ( 2011 ) ) , collided rpps merged . given a primary of mass @xmath97 and a much smaller secondary , both in circular heliocentric orbits",
    ", one can obtain that the ratio @xmath98 of tangential velocity of an encounter up to the hill radius to the escape velocity on the edge of the hill sphere is proportional to @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , collided rpps are more likely to merge when the primary is more massive and located farther from the sun .    if a rpp got its angular momentum at the collision of two rpps at @xmath7=1 au , @xmath100=0.6 , @xmath60=1 , and @xmath2=@xmath3 , then the period @xmath101 of rotation of the planetesimal of density @xmath69=1 g @xmath71 formed from the rpp with intial radius @xmath102 is @xmath700.5 h , i.e. , is smaller than the periods ( 3.3 and 2.3 h ) at which velocity of a particle on a surface of a rotating spherical object at the equator is equal to the circular and escape velocities , respectively .",
    "@xmath101 is proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , @xmath101 and the fraction of the mass of the rpp that could contract to a solid core are smaller for greater @xmath7 . for",
    "those collided rpps that were smaller than their hill spheres and/or differ in masses , @xmath13 was smaller ( and @xmath101 was greater ) than for the above case with @xmath60=1 and @xmath2=@xmath3 .",
    "the above discussion can explain why a fraction of discovered binaries is greater for greater distances between the place of their origin and the sun , and why the typical mass ratio of secondary to primary is greater for tnos than for asteroids .",
    "among 477 main - belt asteroids , pravec et al .",
    "( 2012 ) found 45 binaries ( i.e. the fraction of the binaries is 0.094 ) .",
    "the binary fraction in the minor planet population is about 0.29 for cold classical tnos and is 0.1 for all other tnos ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( noll et al . 2008 ) ) .",
    "note that tnos moving in eccentric orbits ( mentioned above as  other tnos \" ) are thought to have been formed near the giant planets , closer to the sun than classical tnos ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ipatov 1987 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* levison & stern 2001 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gomes 2003 ) ) .",
    "most of rarefied preasteroids could turn into solid asteroids before they collided with other preasteroids .",
    "some present asteroids can be debris of larger solid bodies , and the formation of many binaries with primaries with diameter @xmath104 km can be explained by other models ( not by contraction of rpps ) . in the considered model of binary formation ,",
    "two colliding rpps originate at almost the same distance from the sun .",
    "this point agrees with the correlation between the colors of primaries and secondaries obtained by for trans - neptunian binaries .",
    "in addition , the material within the rpps could have been mixed before the binary components formed .",
    "* nesvorny et al . ( 2010 ) ) supposed that the angular velocities they used were produced during the formation of rpps without collisions .",
    "they noted that simulations by johansen et al .",
    "seem to generally indicated prograde rotation .",
    "angular momenta of some observed trans - neptunian binaries are negative .",
    "the model of collisions of rpps explains negative angular momenta of some observed binaries , as about 20% of collisions of rpps moving in almost circular heliocentric orbits lead to retrograde rotation .",
    "note that if all rpps got their angular momenta at their formation without mutual collisions , then the angular momenta of minor bodies without satellites and those with satellites could be similar ( but actually they differ considerably ) . in my opinion , those rpps that formed tnos with satellites acquired most of their angular momenta at collisions .",
    "the formation of classical tnos from rpps could have taken place for a small total mass of rpps in the trans - neptunian region , even given the present total mass of tnos .",
    "models of formation of tnos from solid planetesimals ( e.g. , ) require a massive primordial belt and small ( @xmath1050.001 ) eccentricities during the process of accumulation .",
    "however , the gravitational interactions between planetesimals during this stage could have increased the eccentricities to values far greater than those mentioned above ( e.g. , ) .",
    "this increase testifies in favor of the formation of tnos from rpps .",
    "the angular momenta of rarefied preplanetesimals needed for formation of small - body binaries can be obtained at collisions of preplanetesimals .",
    "trans - neptunian objects , including those with satellites , could be formed from contracting rarefied preplanetesimals .",
    "the fraction of preplanetesimals collided with other preplanetesimals during their contraction can be about the fraction of small bodies of diameter @xmath106 km with satellites ( among all such small bodies ) , i.e. , it can be about 0.3 in the trans - neptunian belt ."
