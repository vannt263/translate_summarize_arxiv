    "dark matter ( dm ) is one of the most intriguing puzzles in physics .",
    "the fact that dm can not be made of any of the known particles is one of the most appealing arguments for the existence of new physics .",
    "the experimental search for its nature needs the interplay of new collider experiments @xcite and astrophysical observations .",
    "these last ones used to be classified in direct or indirect searches ( although there are other alternatives @xcite ) : elastic scattering of dm particles from nuclei should lead directly to observable nuclear recoil signatures . on the other hand , dm might be detected indirectly , by observing the products of their annihilation into standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "we will focus our discussion on this last alternative .",
    "it has been found that massive brane fluctuations ( branons ) are interesting candidates for dm in brane - world models with low tension @xcite . from the point of view of the 4-dimensional effective phenomenology ,",
    "massive branons are new pseudo - scalar fields which can be understood as the pseudo - goldstone bosons corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in the bulk space produced by the presence of the brane @xcite .",
    "they are prevented from decaying into sm particles by parity invariance on the brane .",
    "the sm - branon low - energy effective lagrangian @xcite can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the number of branon species .",
    "one can see that branons interact by pairs with the sm energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 and that the coupling is suppressed by the brane tension @xmath4 .",
    "limits on the model parameter from tree - level processes in colliders are given by present restrictions coming from hera , tevatron and lep - ii , but also prospects for future colliders such as ilc , lhc or clic can be found in @xcite .",
    "additional bounds from astrophysics and cosmology were obtained in @xcite .",
    "even if branons are stable , two of them may annihilate into ordinary particles such as quarks , leptons and gauge bosons .",
    "their annihilation in different astrophysical objects ( galactic halo , sun , earth , etc . ) produces cosmic rays to be discriminated through distinctive signatures from the background .",
    "after branon annihilation , a cascade process would occur and in the end , the particle species that can be potentially observed would be neutrinos , gamma rays , positrons and antimatter ( antiprotons , antihelium , antideuterons , etc . ) that might be detectable by means of different experimental devices . among them ,",
    "neutrinos and gamma rays have the advantage of maintaining their original direction of motion . on the contrary , charged antimatter searches are hindered by the modification of the propagation trajectories .",
    "the paper has been arranged as follows : in section ii we give a general overview for dark matter indirect detection by using gamma rays and we present the thermal averaged cross sections for branon scenarios . in section iii , we summarize the most relevant gamma - ray telescopes operating nowadays , both satellite and ground - based experiments .",
    "section iv is then devoted to the calculation of the minimum detectable fluxes from different targets by using the already mentioned detectors .",
    "finally , section v contains the main conclusions about the performed analyses .",
    "the differential gamma ray flux from annihilating dm particles in galactic sources can be written as @xcite : @xmath5 \\text{d}s \\label{flux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second term on the r.h.s .",
    "of this equation represents the astrophysical factor , i.e , the integral of the dm mass density profile , @xmath6 , along the path ( line of sight , @xmath7 ) between the source and the gamma ray detector divided by the detector solid angle . on the other hand , the first term is the particle dependent part , with @xmath8 the thermal averaged annihilation cross - section of two dm particles into two sm particles ( labeled by the subindex @xmath9 ) .",
    "the number of photons produced in each decaying channel per energy interval @xmath10 involves decays and/or hadronization of unstable products such as quarks and leptons . due to the non - perturbative",
    "qcd effects , the analytical calculation of these decay chains is a hard task to be accomplished and therefore requires monte carlo events generators such as pythia @xcite particle physics software . by using this software and after exhaustive and statistically significant simulations ,",
    "the gamma - ray spectra were obtained in @xcite . in these works ,",
    "three different parametrizations were found to be able to fit all the available data in the whole accessible photon energy range for the studied channels : the first one for leptons and quarks ( except for the top ) is given by @xmath11\\frac{x^2 - 2x+2}{x}\\ , ; \\label{general_formula}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second for the top quark is encapsulated in the following expression @xmath12}{\\text{ln}\\,p}\\right\\}^{q}\\ , ; \\label{general_formula_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the last one for the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bosons @xmath15}{\\text{ln}\\,p}\\right\\}^{q}. \\label{general_formula_w_z}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the variable @xmath16 stands for @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the photon energy and @xmath19 holds for the dm candidate mass .",
    "the concrete values for the constants in the above expressions ( 3)-(5 ) are given in @xcite and are also available online in numerical codes @xcite .",
    "the contributions of decreasing and increasing exponential factors change depending upon the channel .",
    "the asymptotic logarithmic terms appearing in expressions ( 3)-(5 ) are a consequence of the weizsacker - williams effect @xcite , although with either additive or multiplicative behavior depending on the annihilation channel . for each channel some parameters",
    "are wimp mass dependent whereas the remaining ones are constants .    in the case of heavy branons ,",
    "the main contribution to the photon flux comes from branon annihilation into @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "the contribution from heavy fermions , i.e. , annihilation into top - antitop can be shown to be subdominant @xcite . in this case",
    ", the produced high - energy gamma photons could be in the range ( 30 gev-10 tev ) , detectable by atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( acts ) such as magic @xcite .    on the contrary , if @xmath22 , the annihilation into @xmath13 or @xmath14 bosons is kinematically forbidden and it is necessary to take into account the rest of channels , mainly annihilation into the heaviest possible quarks @xcite as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ br ] . in this case",
    ", the photon fluxes would be in the range detectable by space - based gamma ray observatories @xcite such as egret @xcite and fermi @xcite , with better sensitivities around 30 mev-300 gev .",
    "therefore , in order to compute the final spectrum coming from branon annihilation , we need to know the total annihilation cross section and its annihilation branching ratios into sm particles . for branons ,",
    "the annihilation cross sections only depend on the spin and mass of the particle , and the expressions for branons thermal average annihilations @xmath23 in different sm particles channels , i.e. , in dirac fermions , massive gauge field , massless gauge field and complex scalar field were calculated in @xcite .",
    "for instance , the leading term for non - relativistic branons decaying into a dirac fermion @xmath24 with mass @xmath25 , is given by : @xmath26 for a massive gauge field @xmath14 , of mass @xmath27 , it reads : @xmath28 whereas for a massless gauge field @xmath29 , the leading order is zero : @xmath30 and , finally , for a ( complex ) scalar field @xmath31 with mass @xmath32 : @xmath33    it is worth noting that there would be a gamma ray line from direct annihilation into photons since branons couple directly to them , producing a monochromatic signal at the energy equal to the branon mass .",
    "however , this annihilation takes place in @xmath34-wave channel and it is highly suppressed .",
    "for gamma - ray detection several devices have been used in the last years to observe galactic and extragalactic sources . here",
    "we focus on both satellite and ground - based detectors of gamma - ray photons .",
    "we will analyze the performance of two satellite telescopes : egret and fermi - lat .",
    "egret ( energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ) has detected gamma rays in the interval 0.02 to 30 gev .",
    "this telescope was carefully calibrated at slac with a quasi mono - energetic beam in the energy range of 0.02 to 10 gev .",
    "although the energy range was extended up to higher energies ( 30 gev ) by using monte carlo simulations , we have used only data below 10 gev @xcite due to the associated larger uncertainty at high energy .",
    "the angular resolution was energy dependent , with a 67@xmath36 confinement angle of 5.5@xmath37 at 100 mev , falling to 0.5@xmath37 at 5 gev on axis .",
    "the energy resolution of egret was 20 - 25@xmath36 over most of its range of sensitivity .",
    "absolute arrival times for photons were recorded with approximately 50 @xmath38 accuracy .",
    "the overall normalization error is usually quoted as 15 @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the large area telescope ( lat ) is the principal scientific instrument on the fermi gamma ray space telescope spacecraft , originally called the gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) .",
    "the lat is an imaging high - energy gamma ray telescope covering the energy range from about 20 mev to more than 300 gev @xcite .",
    "the lat s field of view covers about @xmath40 of the sky at any time , and it scans continuously , covering the whole sky every three hours .",
    "the lat measures the tracks of the electron and positron that result when an incident gamma ray undergoes pair - conversion , preferentially in a thin , high - z foil , and measures the energy of the subsequent electromagnetic shower that develops in the telescope calorimeter .",
    "the development of the reconstruction relies heavily on the monte carlo simulation of the events .",
    "the background model for this device includes cosmic rays and earth s albedo gamma rays within the energy range 10 mev to 1 gev .",
    "particles that might either make non astrophysical gamma rays and/or need to be rejected as background are included .",
    "the model does not include x - rays nor soft gamma rays that might cause individual detectors within the lat to be activated @xcite .",
    "recent investigations @xcite have looked for potential dm subhalos targets for acts and fermi at energies higher than 100 gev claiming that multi - wavelength observations could play an essential role in dm indirect searches .      on the other hand ,",
    "the measurement of very high - energy gamma rays using very large ground - based cherenkov telescopes is a recent addition to the variety of experiments at the interface between particle physics , astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "in particular , the magic experiment for ground - based gamma ray astronomy is the largest of the third generation cherenkov telescope experiments , located at the la palma ( canary islands ) observatory , 2200 m above sea level .",
    "it consists of a system of two telescopes operating in a stereoscopic mode .",
    "the stereoscopic system allows for improved background rejection specially at low energies ( and therefore high sensitivity ) , improved energy and angular resolution , and a low energy threshold . the initial setup ( magic - i )",
    "consists of a single telescope ( focal length of 17 m ) .",
    "the threshold for gamma detection is around 60 - 70 gev with classical photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) ; future high - quantum efficiency red - extended pmts are expected to achieve a lower threshold .",
    "magic has the best light collection that has been attempted so far : the largest mirror with an active surface of 234 @xmath41 , combined with the best available photomultiplier tubes that can be obtained , of a quantum efficiency around 30% . as a result , magic is more sensitive to electromagnetic showers of lower energy , and does much to close the gap existing between satellite gamma ray detectors ( that can go up to 10 gev energy ) and cherenkov telescopes ( that presently start at energies higher than @xmath42 gev ) . magic - i has a threshold trigger energy of @xmath43 gev , and an analysis threshold of @xmath44 gev at small zenith angle , which also permits to observe sources with higher redshift than in the past @xcite .",
    "we are also interested in estimating the prospects for future experiments as the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) project , that is an initiative to build the next generation of ground - based very high energy gamma - ray instruments .",
    "current systems of cherenkov telescopes use at most four telescopes , providing best stereo - imaging of particle cascades over a very limited area , with most cascades viewed by only two or three telescopes .",
    "an array of many tens of telescopes will allow the detection of gamma - ray induced cascades over a large area on the ground , increasing the number of detected gamma rays dramatically , while at the same time providing a much larger number of views of each cascade .",
    "this results in both improved angular resolution and better suppression of cosmic - ray background events",
    ". the cta will explore our universe in depth at gamma - rays of very high energy ( vhe ) , i.e. , @xmath45 gev and investigate cosmic non - thermal processes , in close cooperation with observatories operating at other wavelength ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum , and those using other messengers such as cosmic rays and neutrinos .",
    "the design foresees a factor of @xmath46 improvement in sensitivity in the current very high energy gamma ray domain of about 100 gev to some 10 tev , and an extension of the accessible energy range from well below 100 gev to above 100 tev @xcite .",

    "although there are other possibilities , as the galactic center , the best targets to search for a dm annihilation signal seems to be dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) , which are the smallest known systems dominated by dm .",
    "the astrophysical part @xmath70 of the gamma - ray flux ( [ flux ] ) of each target depends upon the dm density .",
    "this factor is not very well known and introduces the most important uncertainties in these indirect detection analyses .",
    "a classic approach uses a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile .",
    "this profile is in good agreement with cold dm simulations and it allows an easy comparison with previous studies since it has been used by many authors . for this reason , we have assumed this profile for the draco , sagittarius and canis major dsphs and for the galactic center .",

    "3 ) . the resulting @xmath164 is a function of the two branon parameters @xmath166 and it does not depend on @xmath2 ( number of branon species ) .",
    "this can be easily understood due to the fact that the proportionally lower flux coming from the annihilation of a larger number of branon species , is compensated by the higher abundance that a larger number of species provides ( for a fixed coupling , i.e. for a fixed value of @xmath167 ) .",

    "we have studied the sensitivity of different gamma - ray telescopes for the observation of indirect signals of branon dark matter in brane - world scenarios . under the assumption that branons are mass degenerate",
    ", this sensitivity only depends on two parameters of the effective theory that describes the low energy dynamics of flexible brane - worlds : the brane tension scale @xmath167 and the branon mass @xmath19 .",
    "we have computed the production of photons coming from branon annihilation happening in either some dsphs or the galactic center , and estimated the sensitivity for these cosmic photons to be detected in different experiments . in particular , we have studied the prospective detectable flux from draco , sagittarius , canis major , segue 1 and for the galactic center for egret , fermi and the future cta . in the case of draco and segue 1 , an estimation for the magic telescope",
    "is given as well .",
    "the estimated constraints show that the interesting parameter space of the theory , where the thermal branon relics account for the total non - baryonic dark matter content of the universe , has not been restricted by present observation yet .",
    "concerning the next generation of acts , they seem to be able to prove this thermal area of the parameter space thanks to , fundamentally , the use of a large number of telescopes which can increase significantly the effective area of detection ( fig . [ act ] ) . with a better sensitivity",

    "<S> branons are new degrees of freedom that appear in flexible brane - world models corresponding to brane fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> . these new fields can behave as standard weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) with a significant associated thermal relic density . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the present constraints from their spontaneous annihilations into photons for egret , fermi - lat and magic , and the prospects for detection in future cherenkov telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we focus on possible signals coming from the galactic center and different dwarf spheroidals , such as draco , sagittarius , canis major and segue 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that for those targets , present observations are below the sensitivity limits for branon detection by assuming standard dark matter distributions and no additional boost factors </S>",
    "<S> . however , future experiments such as cta could be able to detect gamma - ray photons coming from the annihilation of branons with masses higher than 150 gev . </S>"
