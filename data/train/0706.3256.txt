    "a protein is a chain of amino acids , referred to as residues , that folds into a characteristic shape in water at a sufficiently low temperature .",
    "the main force comes from the hydrophobic effect , which tends to drive hydrophobic residues to the interior of the folded conformation , or native state .",
    "hydrogen bonding among residues leads to the formation of alpha helices and beta sheets .",
    "the native structure is usually described in terms of primary , secondary , and tertiary structures , which repsectively refer to the sequence of amino acids along the chain , the alpha helices and beta sheets mentioned , and the gross geometrical structure@xcite .",
    "an interesting question is whether secondary structure emerges before tertiary structure during folding .",
    "we try to answer the question for a protein fragment ( peptide ) , polyalanine ( ala@xmath0 ) , which has 20 identical amino acids , the hydrophobic alanine . the native state is known to be a single alpha helix . the tertiary structure , therefore , is a cylindrical tube .",
    "we use the csaw ( conditioned self - avoiding walk ) model propose recently by one of us@xcite .",
    "the idea is that the unfolded protein is a random coil , which can be represented as a random walk that is not allowed to cross itself .",
    "such a self - avoiding walk ( saw ) simulates the fact that different residues can not occupy the same location in space .",
    "the interactions repsonsible for folding , chiefly the hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen - bonding , are taken into by imposing conditions on the saw , hence the name csaw .    in a computer simulation ,",
    "one generates an ensemble of saw and extracts a sub - ensemble that satisfies desired conditions .",
    "the latter process is implemented through the monte carlo method , which can generate a sequence of states distributed according to a canonical ensemble .",
    "the conditions mentioned are expressed through various energy terms in the hamiltonian .    mathematically , csaw is a simulation of a langevin equation@xcite that describes the folding protein chain .",
    "we refer to refs.@xcite for details , but include a brief summary in the appendix , and illustrate its equivalence to molecular dynamics through a simple example .",
    "we find that , in the case considered , the overall size of the protein has reached an equilibrium value , while helical content continues to increase . in this sense ,",
    "large scale structure forms before small scale structure",
    ". we will be able to see how the helix starts forming through nucleation .",
    "the time evolution of the large and small scale structures exhibit qualitatively different behaviors , which we can explain in terms of phenomenological models .",
    "the formation of small - scale secondary structures are governed by rate equations for the growth of helical content , while the relaxation of the large - scale size is analogous to that of an elastic solid .",
    "since csaw is a relatively new model , this work serves as a test of its validity . in this respect , the model appears to be effective in describing the dynamics of folding .",
    "when we affirm the model , we are affirming the underlying principle as implied by the langevin equation , namely , protein folding is a stochastic dissipative process that tends toward thermal equilibrium with the environment .    from this point of view , the perennial debate on whether the folded state is in therdynamic equilibrium or in some kinetic steady state is merely a question of whether the protein can reach thermal equilibrium in realistic time , or gets trapped in some intermediate state .",
    "the calculations here , using experimental input , indicate that a small protein like the present one reaches thermal equilibrium in the order of 20ns .",
    "it would be interesting to investgate this question for large proteins .",
    "this work is intended to address one aspect of the dynamical process of protein folding , instead of validating the model in a comprehensive way .",
    "therefore , instead of putting everything into a comprehensive model , we focus on two most important interactions for helix formation : hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions .",
    "the monte carlo method used is based on a simulation of the langevin equation , which is consistent to the physical model . despite the simplicity",
    ", this model allows us to delineate the mechanisms of the formation of different scale structures . in the simple example",
    ", we find that the evolution of small and large scale structures involve different mechanisms .",
    "this , not necessary general , can give physical insight for wider understanding of protein folding as a stochastic process .",
    "such physical insight will be helpful for further study , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the initial state of the simulation was created by unfolding the native state of ala@xmath0 through @xmath1 csaw steps , at a program temperature of @xmath2 .",
    "the value was high enough to make the protein unfold into a random coil .",
    "we then set @xmath3 , and the folding process began .",
    "we do not yet have a precise calibration of @xmath4 against the physical temperature .",
    "the folding process ran for @xmath5 csaw steps .",
    "the entire run was repeated 100 times to generate an ensemble of 100 folding trajectories .",
    "each trajectory consumes the order of 1 hr of computer time on a workstation .",
    "a csaw step here means one monte carlo trial step , whether or not the trial results in a successful update .",
    "it simulates real time , during which the system tries to overcome energy barriers but does not always succeed . on average",
    ", it takes about 30 tries to achieve an update .    according to analysis given later , which compares our results with experimental data",
    ", our run corresponds to about 10ns in physical time@xcite . from this",
    "we estimate that one csaw step corresponds to approximately @xmath6 s.    during folding , the helical content rises from an average initial value of 0.05 to 0.55 , and tends toward an asymptote of 0.77 .",
    "this indicates that we have not reached the native state .",
    "the ensemble generated is an evolving ensemble that is not yet canonical .",
    "this suits our purpose , which is to study the folding dynamics .",
    "various relaxation times can be obtained by analyzing the evolution towards equilibrium .",
    "we follow the evolution at different length scales by measuring the average radius of gyration @xmath7 , average length of helix segments @xmath8 , and average helicity @xmath9 .",
    "they are defined by@xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of residues , @xmath12 is the instantaneous position of the center of the @xmath13th residue , and @xmath14 denotes ensemble average at time @xmath15 .",
    "these quantities respectively measure structures on the largest , intermediate , and smallest length scales .",
    "we also measure the structure factor@xmath16   \\right ) \\right\\rangle , \\ ] ] which is the fourier transform of the density correlation function , accessible to experiments through x - ray scattering .",
    "it is independent of the directions of @xmath17 because of the ensemble average@xcite .",
    "fig.[fig:1 ] shows distributions of @xmath7 , @xmath18 @xmath9 at different times .",
    "fig.[fig:2 ] shows @xmath7 , @xmath18 @xmath9 as functions of time on a log scale .",
    "lines through the calculated points are fit made to obtain relaxation times , to be detailed later .",
    "the behavior of  @xmath7 shows that there was a very fast collapse , followed by two slower stages .",
    "such a two - stage behavior has been observed experimentally in larger proteins@xcite .",
    "we shall analyze them later in terms of theoretical models .    as we can see from fig.[fig:2 ] , there is little change in @xmath7 apart from fluctuations after 1ns , but @xmath8 and @xmath9 continue to increase .",
    "this means that , while the overall size of the protein has equilibriated , the secondary structures continue to adjust .",
    "we shall quantify this in terms of relaxation times .",
    "fig.[fig:3 ] shows @xmath19 as functions of @xmath20 , for different times ( see caption for detail ) .",
    "fig.[fig:4 ] shows a contour map of the ensemble average of local helicity .",
    "the vertical axis is residue number , and the horizontal axis is time .",
    "helix nucleation started near residues 6 and 14 . since the contour plot here is an ensemble average",
    ", this indicated that the nucleation points are not random , but occur at specific positions , at least for this small protein .",
    "the existence of two folding stages suggest that we fit the late - time evolutions with two exponential functions .",
    "indeed , we obtain good fits for @xmath8,@xmath9 with @xmath21 where the unit for @xmath15 is ns .",
    "these are shown as solid curves in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "they suggest that the ensemble will reach equilibrium at 20ns , with average helical content @xmath22 .",
    "the relaxation times for the two stages are @xmath23ns and 4.68ns , respectively .",
    "the time scale is determined as follows .",
    "originally @xmath15 was measured in csaw steps .",
    "we judge that at the end of our runs the folding process was about 70% complete , and that puts the halfway point at about 3@xmath24 steps . identifying this with the experimental value of @xmath25ns @xcite",
    ", we arrive at the estimate of approximately @xmath6s per step .",
    "the two - stage behavior of the development of secondary structure suggests the following model .",
    "we picture the ensemble as a mixture of three classes of protein chains : unfolded ( u ) with @xmath26 intermediate ( i ) with @xmath27 , and folded ( f ) with @xmath28 .",
    "there are three - state transitions among these classes:@xmath29 the relative fractions of these classes evolve with time .",
    "these fractions can be obtained by solving rate equations , using time constants given prevously .",
    "they can of course be extracted from our simulation data .",
    "fig.[fig:5 ] shows that the two agree rather well .",
    "the two - exponential fit does not work for @xmath7 , as we see by the dashed curve in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "thus , the relaxation of of @xmath7 calls for a different mechanism . for this",
    ", we model the gross structure as an elastic solid , with an effective potential energy@xmath30 and a phenomenological equation of motion@xmath31 where @xmath15 is in ns , @xmath7 in a. solving the equation with @xmath32 , initial condition @xmath33 , we obtain the solid curve in fig.[fig:2 ] , which gives a good fit to the simulation data .",
    "fig.[fig:2 ] shows that @xmath7 reaches equilibrum after about 1 ns , at a value slightly lower than the data points .",
    "this suggests that there are perturbations to radius relaxation from the secondary structure , which continues to undergo adjustment .",
    "in our ensemble , we find that there are two types of evolution paths , a fast and a slow one , as illustrated in fig.[fig:6 ] .",
    "this supports results from discontinuous molecular dyanmics@xcite .",
    "we have found the same fast and slow paths in the folding of chignolin , a 10-residue synthetic peptide@xcite .",
    "the meaning of this is not yet clear .    in an early work on alpha - helix formation , zimm and",
    "bragg introduced parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which respectively measures the probability of helix growth and nucleation .",
    "the quantities of these two parameters are related to @xmath36 and @xmath37 according to following equations@xcite , @xmath38 we have calculated these quantities using csaw . an advantage in our model is that we can turn on or off selected interactions . in fig.[fig:7 ] we show the results with and without the hydrophobic effect .",
    "we can see that the hydrophobic effect has pronounced influence on helix nucleation , but it is not as important for helix growth .",
    "the csaw model is an algorithm that successively updates a protein state , in order to generate a canonical ensemble of states .",
    "starting with an initial state which is an arbitrary non - overlapping chain ( saw ) , we generate a new chain by the pivoting algorithm , and keep doing so until we obtain another non - overlapping chain ( a new saw ) .",
    "we then decide whether to accept this as an update via the metropolis monte carlo method , as follows .",
    "we ask whether the proposed update decreases the energy @xmath39 .",
    "if it does we accept it , and otherwise accept it with a relative probability given by the boltzmann factor@xmath40 that the energy can increase simulates thermal fluctuations , and makes the updating process one of minimizing the free energy .    along the backbone of the protein chain a series of carbon atoms ( the @xmath41 are connected by covalent chemical bonds that are shaped like a crank , which lies in one plane .",
    "the major degrees of freedom of the chain are the torsional angles that define the relative orientation of two successive planes .",
    "other degrees of freedom , such as small vibrations of the chemical bonds , can be neglected when we consider protein folding .",
    "the state of a protein of @xmath11 residues are thus specified by @xmath42 pairs of torsional angles .",
    "these are the only degrees of freedom considered .    for the present study , side chains are approximated by hard spheres , and other atoms",
    "are treated as hard spheres with known van der waals radii .",
    "the only interactions included are those corresponding to the hydrophobic effect , and hydrogen bonding .",
    "the energy is taken to be@xmath43 where : @xmath44 is the total hydorphobic contact number , i.e. , the total number of nearest neighbors surrounding a hydrophobic residue , ( not counting the two permanent nearest neighbors along the chain . ) in the present case , all residues are hydrophobic .",
    "the quantity @xmath45 is the total number of internal hydrogen bonds , which connects hydrogen to oxygen in different residues .",
    "such a bond is deemed to exist whenever the partner are within a certain range of distrance from each other , and the chemical bonds they are attached to are antiparallel within given margins .",
    "in general , the clear separation of hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding is an approximation , under the assumption that atoms on the backbone can only bond with one another , while those on the side chains can only bond with water . in the present case",
    "this distinction is moot , since all rersidues are hydrophobic , whose side chains can not form hydrogen bonds .",
    "there are two independent parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the model .",
    "actually , in the monte carlo procedure , only the combinations @xmath48 and @xmath49 are relevant .",
    "we define a program temperature @xmath50 and use @xmath4 and @xmath51 as independent parameters . to simplify the notation , we set @xmath52 . to fix the parameters",
    ", we calculate the helical content @xmath9 for various values , and choose that which gives the maximum helicity after 10@xmath53 csaw steps .",
    "the contour map of @xmath9 so obtained is shown in fig.[fig:8 ] , from which we pick the values @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "the csaw model is a computer simulation of a generalized langevin equation for the protein chain , which has the form@xmath56 where @xmath57 is the position of the @xmath58th atom , @xmath59 its mass , @xmath60 its dissipation coefficient , and @xmath61 the random force acting on it by the medium .",
    "the term @xmath62 is a symbolic representation of all the non - random forces acting on the atom , including interaction with other atoms in the protein , the chemical bonds that hold the chain together , and the hydrophobic interaction with the medium .",
    "it is highly improbable that we can solve this equation analytically , but we can simulate on a computer .",
    "the dissipation and random force is simulated by random walk , and the forces in @xmath62 that maintain the chain and prevent atoms from overlapping make the random walk a saw .",
    "the rest of the forces in @xmath62 is taken into account through monte carlo .    to illustrate that this procedure yields a solution of the equation",
    ", we consider a simpler case , the brownian motion of a particle in 1d , in a potential well .",
    "the lagevin equation reads@xmath63 with a double - well potential @xmath64 which is sketched in fig.[fig:9 ] , with @xmath65 the equation is then solved as a stochastic differentiation using molecular dynamics , and alternatively using monte carlo .",
    "comparison of these two methods are given in fig.[fig:10 ] , which show the equivalence in a statistical sense .",
