    "the propagation of pulses in granular materials has been a subject of vigorous recent interest",
    ". seminal work on this subject was carried out by nesterenko  @xcite two decades ago in his analysis of the propagation of nonlinear compression pulses along a line of particles .",
    "this early work firmly established the nonlinear flavor of the problem : nesterenko showed that under appropriate assumptions , among them the slow spatial variation of the displacements of the particles , the equations of motion for granular particles could in most cases be approximated by a continuous nonlinear partial differential equation that admits a soliton solution ( later shown to actually be a solitary wave solution  @xcite ) for a propagating perturbation in the chain .",
    "the recent revival of interest in the subject  @xcite has been triggered in part by a concern with important technological applications such as the design of efficient shock absorbers  @xcite , the detection of buried objects  @xcite , and the fragmentation of granular chains  @xcite . the revival has involved advances in the modeling , simulation , and solution of the equations associated with important features of granular materials such as their discreteness  @xcite , dimensionality  @xcite , disorder  @xcite , and loading provided by gravitational forces  @xcite .",
    "the preponderance of the work has been numerical , but important analytic advances have also been made , as well as experimental verifications of some of the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "the standard generic model potential between monodisperse elastic granules that repel upon overlap according to the hertz law is given by  @xcite @xmath3 here @xmath4,\\ ] ] @xmath5 @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote young s modulus and poisson s ratio , @xmath8 denotes the initial equilibrium position of granule @xmath9 in the chain , and @xmath10 is the displacement of granule @xmath9 from this equilibrium position .",
    "the geometric parameter @xmath11 is the radius if the particles are elastic spheres .",
    "more generally , @xmath11 is determined by the principal radii of curvature of the surfaces at the point of contact  @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath12 is @xmath13 for spheres , it is @xmath14 for cylinders , and in general depends on geometry .",
    "the displacement of the @xmath9-th granule ( @xmath15 ) in the chain from its equilibrium position in a frictional medium is governed by the equation of motion @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the heavyside function , @xmath18 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "it ensures that the particles interact only when in contact .",
    "note that for open boundary conditions the second term on the right hand side of this equation is absent for the last granule and the third term is absent for the first , while for periodic boundary conditions @xmath23 . in terms of the rescaled variables and parameters",
    "@xmath24 eq .  ( [ eq : motion ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath25 where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "initially the granules are placed along a line so that they just touch their neighbors in their equilibrium positions ( no precompression ) , and all but one granule , granule @xmath27 , are at rest .",
    "the velocity of granule @xmath27 is @xmath28 ( the impulse ) . in the rescaled variables the initial conditions become @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . in our work",
    "we set @xmath33 .    in the absence of the frictional contribution @xmath34 or @xmath35 , when @xmath1 an initial impulse settles into a pulse that becomes increasingly narrow with increasing @xmath12 , and propagates at a velocity that is essentially constant and determined by @xmath12 and by the amplitude of the pulse .",
    "for @xmath0 the pulse spreads in time and travels at a constant velocity independent of pulse amplitude . in the latter case",
    "there is considerable backscattering that leads to backward motion of all the granules behind the pulse , whereas the backscattering is minimal for @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the pulse is a completely conservative solitary wave in the limit @xmath36 .    _",
    "our interest lies in ascertaining the effects of the frictional contributions on these results . _",
    "although friction is on occasion mentioned in theoretical and numerical work , it is usually mentioned as an element that is neglected or omitted .",
    "however , its presence and importance in experiments is recognized as inevitable  @xcite .",
    "note that frictional effects may arise not only from the forces between the granular chain and the surrounding medium but also from the conversion of translational motion to other degrees of freedom ( e.g. rotation )  @xcite . in an earlier paper we analyzed in detail the effects of frictional forces on the dynamics of two granules , specifically the way in which forward and backward motion of the granules",
    "is affected by these forces  @xcite .",
    "herein we extend that work to a chain of granules .    since our approach will in general follow",
    "established methods , it is useful to lay out at the outset an overview of the principal approaches that have been implemented in the study of pulse dynamics in frictionless chains , and the various features that determine these dynamics . theoretical studies of pulse dynamics in frictionless chains have mainly relied on three approaches :    \\(1 ) numerical solution of the equations of motion  @xcite ;    \\(2 ) continuum approximations to the equations of motion followed by exact or approximate solutions of these approximate equations  @xcite ; and    \\(3 ) phenomenology about properties of pairwise ( or at times three - body ) collisions together with the assumption that pulses are sufficiently narrow to be principally determined by these properties  @xcite .    from these studies it is clear that there three features determine the dynamics in these chains :    \\(1 ) the power @xmath12 in the potential ;    \\(2 ) the absence of a restoring force ; and    \\(3 ) the discreteness of the system .    while each of these leads to essential aspects of the dynamics , the literature is not always entirely clear on which feature is determinant in a particular behavior , nor is it always clear which of these features is being approximated or even ignored .",
    "one example is the equivocal connection between the dynamics of granular systems and systems with power law interaction potentials that _ include _ a restoring force .",
    "for instance , there is an extensive literature on the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) chain with purely nonlinear interactions of the form appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion_rescaled ] ) with @xmath1 but without the heavyside theta functions  @xcite .",
    "highly localized pulses propagate in these systems  @xcite , but their relation to the localized solutions in granular systems is by no means clear .",
    "this ambiguity is exacerbated by the fact that discrete systems are frequently approximated by continuum equations .",
    "while the pulse - like ( soliton or solitary wave ) solutions that emerge from these approximations are assumed ( and even shown numerically ) to describe certain aspects of granular system , the continuum approximations never explicitly respect the absence of a restoring force , i.e. , they are more clearly justifiable for fpu - like systems . and so with these solutions in hand",
    ", it is not clear what consequences of the absence of a restoring force and of the discreteness of the system have been lost . in some sense",
    "opposite to the continuum approximations are two - body or three - body phenomenologies .",
    "these provide considerable qualitative insight into some consequences of discreteness , but are quantitatively not sufficiently accurate because the true dynamics extend over more than two or three granules . in this paper , even while focusing on the effects of friction , we make an attempt to provide some clarity on these issues .",
    "numerical simulations are of course extremely helpful and ultimately an accurate test of theory .",
    "note that the rescaled system eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion_rescaled ] ) has no free parameters in the absence of friction and only a single parameter when there is friction , and therefore numerical characterization is particularly straightforward in this particular system . however , this universality is lost with any of a number of modifications that might be interesting and have been considered recently such as , for example , tapering of the masses in the chain  @xcite and mass  @xcite or frictional  @xcite disorder .",
    "consequently , it is desirable to have a strong analytic backdrop .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : cylinder ] deals with a chain of cylindrical granules .",
    "first we review existing results for frictionless granules , discussing them in the context of the issues and uncertainties noted earlier .",
    "we then extend the theory to granules subject to friction , and present numerical simulations in support of these results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sphere ] we follow the same presentation sequence for granules with @xmath1 , with special attention to spherical granules in our numerical simulations .",
    "a summary of results and of future directions is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "cylindrical granules have provided a theoretical testbed for dynamics in granular chains because the exponent @xmath0 leads to analytic manageability not available for other potentials .",
    "although sometimes called the `` harmonic '' case , it should be remembered that the hertz potential is quite different because there is no restoring force , that is , the cylindrical hertz potential is half of a harmonic potential .",
    "the derivative of the force law therefore changes discontinuously between extension and compression .",
    "this leads to considerable differences in the chain dynamics .",
    "nevertheless , some aspects of the cylindrical chain dynamics can be inferred from those of a harmonic chain , and this can be exploited to great advantage in the analysis .    if one were to ignore the absence of a restoring force and implement the simplest continuum approximation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion_rescaled ] ) in the absence of friction , the result would be a simple wave equation with diffusive coupling whose solutions do not represent the observed behavior of the @xmath0 chain . in reality , an initial impulse in the chain described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion_rescaled ] ) in the absence of friction moves as a spreading pulse .",
    "although the pulse spreads and sheds some energy , the waveform can nevertheless be clearly identified as a pulse  @xcite .",
    "its maximum @xmath37 travels forward with a constant unit velocity and a displacement amplitude that increases as @xmath38 .",
    "the pulse spreads in time as @xmath39 , _ more slowly _ than it would in a system with diffusive coupling .",
    "it is interesting to understand which of these features are due to the discrete nature of the chain , and which are due to the absence of a restoring force .",
    "further , once these questions have been answered , it is interesting to explore what happens to these features in the presence of friction .",
    "our presentation of the chain of cylindrical granules consists of three parts .",
    "first we review the results of hinch and saint - jean  ( hsj )  @xcite for a frictionless chain , and we recast the problem in a way that clarifies some of the approximations made in that work and pinpoints the sources of differences between the @xmath0 chain and a purely diffusive coupling .",
    "we supplement this review with our analytic results that reproduce some of their purely numerical ones",
    ". then we modify this analysis to include the effects of weak hydrodynamic friction on the granules .",
    "finally , we complement this analytic ( and necessarily approximate ) treatment with a comparison with numerical simulation results for the frictional chain of cylindrical granules .",
    "the hsj theory is based on the following approximations implemented consecutively and independently .",
    "the solution is assumed to be described by a traveling pulse of constant form which propagates at constant unit speed and has an amplitude @xmath40 and width @xmath41 that vary slowly with time : @xmath42    \\2 .",
    "the pulse is assumed to retain almost all of its initial energy .",
    "hsj show that assumption 1 .",
    "leads to equipartition of this energy between potential and kinetic forms , as should be the case for a harmonic potential .",
    "these two assumptions are sufficient to lead to the conclusion that @xmath43 .",
    "a continuum approximation is implemented that takes into account some discreteness effects . in the lowest order diffusive coupling approximation",
    "one would set the difference @xmath44 .",
    "retention of the next term in a taylor series expansion of @xmath45 about @xmath46 leads to the continuum approximation that incorporates some of the effects of discreteness : @xmath47 _ note that this expansion includes a restoring force .",
    "_ a transformation to a moving frame with unit propagation velocity , i.e. , a change of variables from @xmath9 and @xmath26 to @xmath48 and @xmath26 , transforms this equation to @xmath49    regardless of the form of @xmath50 or of the function @xmath51 , this is sufficient to establish that the solution eq .",
    "( [ eq : assume ] ) is consistent with this equation only if @xmath52 , and also that the next term in the taylor series expansion is unimportant for this result . _",
    "the width of the pulse is therefore governed by the first manifestation of discreteness .",
    "_ one assumes that the absence of a restoring force does not affect this result because the granules within the pulse are in fact overlapping most of the time and hence subject mainly to the repulsive portion of the potential .",
    "note that the continuum approximation together with the conservation of energy are then sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that @xmath53 , i.e. , that the pulse amplitude actually grows with time .",
    "it is not yet clear that ( [ eq : assume ] ) is actually compatible with ( [ eq : wavehinch ] ) until one determines the function @xmath51 .",
    "substitution of ( [ eq : assume ] ) into ( [ eq : wavehinch ] ) and retention of leading terms in @xmath26 leads to the equation for @xmath54 , @xmath55 this equation has four solutions .",
    "the one consistent with the requirement that @xmath54 decays for large @xmath56 ( i.e. , ahead of the wave ) and consistent with the assumption of energy conservation by the pulse is  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an airy function and @xmath59^{1/2 } = 3.533 \\sqrt{e_p}. \\label{eq : normalization}\\ ] ] here @xmath60 is the pulse energy and @xmath61 is the first zero of @xmath58 .",
    "these features describe the traveling displacement pulse of increasing width and amplitude quite accurately , as shown by the numerical simulations in  @xcite .",
    "we note that the total energy of the system with the initial unit velocity impulse at one granule is @xmath62 .",
    "the numerical results of hsj lead to an asymptotic pulse energy of @xmath63 , that is , @xmath64 of the energy resides in the pulse .",
    "below we calculate the pulse energy analytically .",
    "in addition to the forward traveling pulse , hsj also investigate the momentum of the particles ejected backward as the pulse goes by . that particles must be ejected is a consequence of the conservation of momentum : the traveling pulse of constant energy and increasing width and displacement amplitude carries increasing forward momentum , which must be balanced by the backward momentum of the ejected particles .",
    "one then arrives at the next item on the list of assumptions :    \\5 .",
    "the absence of a restoring force is explicitly recognized in the calculation of the momentum of the ejected particles , which simply keep traveling backward with the momentum they acquire at the moment of separation from the pulse . equating the rate of change of the momentum of the forward pulse at time @xmath26 to that of the particle ejected at that time leads to the conclusion that the backward momentum of the @xmath65 particle is @xmath66 , the latter equality arising from the unit speed of pulse propagation .",
    "the numerical simulations of hsj lead to the value @xmath67 , a value that we obtain analytically .    to obtain analytic results for the pulse energy @xmath60 and the constant of proportionality @xmath68",
    ", we note that the forward momentum of the propagating pulse is @xmath69 where @xmath70 the rate of change of the forward momentum then is @xmath71 . since the pulse velocity is unity , this is the momentum transferred to the last particle as it is ejected : @xmath72 the backscattered energy then is @xmath73 and for the total energy we obtain @xmath74 from which it immediately follows that asymptotically the energy in the pulse is @xmath75 thus , 94.7% of the energy resides in the pulse ( to be compared to the hsj value of @xmath64 obtained from simulations ) and the remainder is backscattered . with the initial condition @xmath76 used in all simulations we thus have for the constants defined earlier @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the constant @xmath68 in hsj is @xmath79 , exactly as they obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "this essentially completes the solution .",
    "the summary description is then that an initial velocity impulse propagates forward at unit speed , with a width that grows as @xmath39 and a displacement amplitude that grows as @xmath38 .",
    "this pulse carries almost all of the initial energy and its momentum increases .",
    "this increase in momentum is compensated by granules that are ejected backward as the pulse passes .",
    "the speed of the ejected granules decreases , the @xmath65 granule being ejected with a speed proportional to @xmath80 .",
    "further insights can be gained by viewing this problem a bit differently .",
    "suppose that we do not implement a continuum approximation at all , but instead focus on the full discrete equation @xmath81 like the continuum equation , this of course includes restoring forces .",
    "this equation can be solved exactly  @xcite , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the bessel function of the first kind  @xcite .",
    "the solution is a moving spreading pulse along with oscillatory displacements that are left in its wake ( precisely because there are restoring forces ) .",
    "the peak and width of the pulse can be obtained from the properties of the bessel functions , in particular from knowledge of their first two zeroes and the first maximum  @xcite .",
    "the maximum of the pulse occurs at @xmath84 , so the pulse velocity is unity .",
    "its width increases as @xmath39 . in these",
    "features the solution is similar to the one assumed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : assume ] )",
    ". however , the amplitude of the displacement pulse does not grow but is instead constant in time .",

    "( [ eq : wavehinch ] ) that @xmath51 satisfies the equation @xmath86 . ) the pulse energy according to this description is not constant but instead decreases as @xmath87 .",
    "the energy that is lost goes into the oscillatory displacements in the wake of the harmonic pulse caused by the restoring forces .",
    "additional _ and appropriate assumption of _ energy conservation _ in hsj adds this lost energy back into the pulse without affecting its spreading rate or velocity . _ this indicates that _ ( in the @xmath0 problem ) _ energy conservation is an appropriate additional assumption in lieu of the absence of a restoring force_.    in summary : the fact that the solution of the @xmath0 hertz problem is a spreading pulse of unit velocity and of width that increases as @xmath39 is purely a consequence of the discreteness of the system and not dependent on the presence or absence of restoring forces ; it is a feature of a discrete harmonic system .",
    "the ( near ) conservation of energy in the pulse is _ not _ a feature of a harmonic system and must be included as an _ additional _ assumption .",
    "conservation of energy must be implemented not only to describe all the features of the traveling pulse but also to describe the backward momentum of the particles ejected as the pulse moves along .",
    "extensive numerical results quantitatively supporting the features just described can be found in  @xcite .      the theory first introduced by nesterenko  @xcite and later augmented and complemented by others",
    "is based on the same approximation implemented in the case of cylindrical granules , i.e. , a taylor expansion of @xmath45 about @xmath46 and retention of a term beyond the first ( which here is no longer purely diffusive coupling ) .",
    "this continuum equation , assumed to hold within the compression pulse , again does not explicitly exclude restoring forces and is therefore equivalent to a continuum approximation with some contributions due to discreteness for the fpu problem .",
    "the starting equation is thus @xmath139 and the resulting continuum approximation is @xmath140 - \\frac{1}{24}\\frac{\\partial^3}{\\partial k^3 } \\left [ \\left ( - \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial k}\\right ) ^{n-1 } \\right ] .",

    "substitution of this solution into the propagating equation leads to the following values : @xmath148 an additional assumption is introduced at this point : a solitary wave is `` constructed '' by retaining this solution over one period , @xmath149 , and setting @xmath150 equal to zero outside of this range .",
    "note that this solution does not satisfy the velocity pulse initial condition , but rather it describes the solution that the system presumably settles into after a short initial transient , an assumption that is supported by numerical simulation results  @xcite .",
    "for spherical granules @xmath151    if the initial velocity impulse is unity , then the initial total energy ( all kinetic ) is @xmath62 . the solitary wave ( [ eq : soliton ] ) , which describes both the potential and kinetic energy of the system once it settles , is assumed to contain essentially all of this initial energy ( the numerical simulation results confirm that the energy of the solitary wave is @xmath152 of the initial energy  @xcite ) . because the potential is nonlinear , the potential and kinetic energies are no longer equal , but one can use the generalized equipartition theorem  @xcite to calculate the average contribution of each .",
    "one finds that the ratio is @xmath153 , so that @xmath154 .",
    "since the velocity is @xmath155 the total kinetic energy in the pulse is @xmath156 where  @xcite @xmath157 the resulting pulse speed @xmath142 and pulse amplitude for @xmath2 then are @xmath158 the numerical results of hsj give @xmath159 .",
    "contrary to the @xmath0 case , here there is almost no backscattering  @xcite . except for the first two or three granules that are slightly scattered backwards , the granules in the pulse are simply displaced by a constant amount and come to rest once the pulse passes .",
    "the total backward momentum is thus extremely small and finite .",
    "beyond the first two or three granules , the forward moving pulse here retains its shape and amplitude and is therefore essentially conservative with respect to both energy and momentum . this is to be contrasted with the fact that for cylindrical granules , every granule acquires a backward momentum .",
    "here we generalize the previous theories to a chain in which the granules experience friction [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : motion_rescaled ] ) ] .",
    "we generalize the hsj theory to this case and also use the solution of the damped harmonic chain to complement these results .",
    "the solution is assumed to be a traveling pulse of constant shape which propagates at unit speed , has a width @xmath41 that varies slowly in time , and an amplitude that _ aside from an exponential decay due to the friction _ also varies slowly with time : @xmath88 we retain only the @xmath89-independent portions of the slowly varying functions @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "this is thus a `` lowest order '' ansatz .",

    "[ fig : nestscaling ] include values that might fall anywhere within these oscillations .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that the theory captures the qualitative features of the pulse . in particular , we point to the increasing backscattering with increasing friction that can be seen in these figures .",

    "the archetypal system for the study of impulse dynamics associated with a hertz potential of exponent @xmath1 consists of spherical granules .",
    "such a nonlinear potential gives rise to a traveling pulse of essentially constant speed that seems to retain its shape for very long times , i.e. it travels with essentially constant amplitude and constant width .",
    "we say `` essentially '' because this is the outcome of approximate theories  @xcite and of numerical simulations  @xcite but is not a rigorous result ( except for @xmath137 ) .",
    "the pulse arises from the balance of the dispersive forces that tend to spread the excitation , and the nonlinear and discrete nature of the system that focuses it . as we saw in the last section ,",
    "discreteness is not sufficient to stop the widening of the pulse , but only to slow it down .",
    "nonlinearity is necessary to obtain a pulse of constant width , at the very least approximately .",

    "this sort of behavior is also known from the classic fpu problem where the potential typically considered is quartic , @xmath138 ( or a combination of @xmath138 and lower order contributions ) , and includes restoring forces  @xcite .",
    "the absence of dispersive restoring forces in a hertz system causes the localized excitation to be even more stable than in the associated fpu system .    in this section",

    "we begin by briefly reviewing the theory for a chain of frictionless spherical granules as first presented by nesterenko  @xcite",

    "there is no exactly solvable discrete counterpart even if one includes restoring forces .",

    "in this work we have studied the dynamics of an initial velocity impulse in a chain of granules that interact only when in contact , that is , they experience only a repulsive potential .",
    "our interest has been in establishing the effects of hydrodynamic friction on these dynamics .",
    "first we analyzed a chain of cylindrical granules , that is , with a power law repulsive potential with exponent @xmath0 ( half a harmonic potential ) .",
    "we presented the frictionless case , and organized existing information in a particular way to clarify the effects of discreteness and of the absence of restoring forces on these results .",
    "we were also able to obtain a number of results analytically that had previously only been obtained numerically  @xcite . in this chain",
    "the impulse travels at unit velocity as a spreading pulse ( as @xmath39 ) in which the maximum displacement progressively grows with time ( as @xmath38 ) .",
    "while this traveling pulse carries most of the initial energy , conservation of momentum requires that there be backscattering of each granule as the pulse passes by .",
    "the chain thus continually undergoes fragmentation .",
    "we then generalized these results in the presence of friction and found that the principal effect of weak friction is an overall exponential decay of the energy .",
    "the pulse still moves at unit velocity , still spreads as @xmath39 , and the maximum displacement now varies as @xmath218 throughout its lifetime .",
    "there is again backscattering of each granule as the pulse passes by .",
    "an interesting and unexpected effect of friction is that the velocity of the backscattered particles at the moment of ejection is _ greater _ than the velocity in the frictionless chain  @xcite .",
    "the backscattered particles also slow down due to friction , but this chain , too , undergoes continual fragmentation .",
    "we supported our results via numerical simulations .",
    "next we analyzed a chain of granules with a power law repulsive potential with exponent @xmath1 , with special attention to spherical granules ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we reviewed nesterenko s theory for the frictionless case , which leads to an essentially conservative pulse of constant width determined by the power @xmath12 , traveling down the chain at a velocity that depends on the energy of the pulse .",
    "this velocity is lower than that of the spreading pulse in the cylindrical granule case . here",
    "again we obtained some results analytically that had previously been reported numerically  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the @xmath0 case there is essentially no backscattering ( fragmentation ) in this system : only the first two or three granules acquire a very small backward momentum as the pulse passes over .",
    "the generalization of these results in the presence of friction are more complicated because an overall decay of the energy causes the pulse to slow down as it moves .",
    "we found that the solution is one in which the overall shape of the pulse as well as its width remain unchanged , the energy decay is exponential , as is the decrease in the displacement pulse amplitude and the pulse velocity .",
    "the exponential decay factors are fixed by the power @xmath12 of the potential .",
    "most dramatically , we found that in the presence of friction there is now backscattering of each granule as the pulse passes by , so that this chain experiences fragmentation .",
    "the velocity of the backscattered granules of course also decreases exponentially .",
    "we supported these results for the case of spherical granules via numerical simulations .",
    "a number of interesting problems immediately come to mind as a possible extension of this work . among them",
