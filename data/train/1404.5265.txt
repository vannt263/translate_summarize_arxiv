    "since wigner s initial suggestion @xcite that the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of random hermitian matrices should provide a good description of the excited states of complex nuclei , random matrix theory ( rmt ) has become one of the prominent fields of research , at the boundary between atomic physics , solid state physics , statistical mechanics , statistics , probability theory , and number theory @xcite .",
    "the two main models for hermitian random matrices ( which have been extensively studied in the literature , see @xcite for a review of rmt ) are : ( i ) the ensembles of wigner matrices which have independent ( up to symmetry ) and identically distributed entries ; ( ii ) the classical real , complex and quaternion _ invariant _ ensembles , which are respectively stable under the conjugation by the orthogonal , unitary , and symplectic groups .",
    "the intersection between those two types of random matrices is actually reduced to the famous gaussian orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ensembles .    in this paper",
    ", we construct hermitian matrix diffusion processes @xmath11 , which evolve in _ non - confining _ potentials and which are invariant under rotation at all time @xmath12 .",
    "the initial motivation for our work is to make sense of invariant ensembles of random matrices in non - confining potentials such as @xmath13 , which can not be defined in the usual way because of the divergence of the partition function .",
    "the family @xmath14 of potentials we are looking at includes the cubic interaction ( @xmath15 ) and our results can be extended to a variety of non - confining polynomial potentials with the same ideas .",
    "in particular , our method also permits us to construct a family of invariant ensembles in non - confining quartic potentials of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a parameter called the coupling constant .",
    "such potentials @xmath18 have already been considered in the paper @xcite , where brzin , itzykson , parisi and zuber use an enumerative formula established in @xcite for planar diagrams in terms of matrix integrals associated to the potential @xmath18 , to count planar diagrams .",
    "our construction brings new lights on some of their results on the limiting spectral density as the dimension @xmath19 , in the case @xmath17 .",
    "the idea of our construction is inspired by @xcite where halperin studies one dimensional diffusion processes in non - confining potentials .",
    "we first simply let our diffusive matrix process evolve in the non - confining potential of interest , until the first explosion time of one of the coefficients of the matrix . to extend the trajectory after this explosion time",
    ", we restart our matrix process at this time from a new position insuring continuity of the non - exploding coefficients , until the next explosion occurs , and so on . this procedure is explained in section [ cubic - hermitian - process ] . after some time",
    ", we expect that this matrix process will reach an equilibrium , which is , in contrast with the classical case of dyson brownian motion in a quadratic potential , a _ dynamical steady state_. in particular , we establish in section [ stationary - flux ] that there is a stationary flux of particles ( eigenvalues ) flowing across @xmath8 in the steady state if the barrier of the potential is not too strong to confine the particles .",
    "this feature appears to be new and leads to interesting further questions about the fluctuations of this flux around its leading order in the large @xmath20-limit .",
    "we compute the leading behavior of the stationary flux in the large @xmath20 limit ( see formula [ leading - flux ] ) , which measures the number of eigenvalues crossing over the system per unit of time .",
    "we believe that our construction defines an interesting model of interacting charged particles with a random flux , to be related with the asymmetric exclusion processes which have attracted attention in the last decade ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the particular case of a cubic potential , we describe precisely the dynamics of the spectrum of our matrix process in the limit of large dimension @xmath20 in section [ dynamic - density ] .",
    "we analyze the stationary state of this dynamic by computing explicitly the spectral density , which gives the global allocation of the eigenvalues .",
    "we observe an interesting sharp phase transition for this spectral density at the critical value @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath6 , then the well of the potential @xmath4 is not deep enough to prevent a macroscopic proportion of the eigenvalues to explode and we find a stationary spectral density @xmath7 with full support in @xmath8 , flanked with heavy tails such that @xmath9 as @xmath10 . on the contrary , if @xmath21 , then the eigenvalues are confined in the well near @xmath22 of the potential @xmath4 such that the spectral density in the stationary state has compact support .",
    "the underlying flux of particles displays also a phase transition at the critical value @xmath2 .",
    "the current of particles , which allocate according to the stationary profile @xmath1 , is macroscopic compared to the total mass of the @xmath20 eigenvalues if @xmath23 whereas it is microscopic if @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude in the last section [ conclusion ] with some open questions related to the statistics of the eigenvalues and their current , in the stationary state",

    "this family of potential @xmath47 includes the cubic interaction ( case @xmath15 ) and we shall soon see that it is also natural to introduce a linear term in order to cover a wider variety of behaviours . besides , this family of potentials already appeared in various contexts : random matrices @xcite , random schrdinger operators and diffusions @xcite .    if @xmath48 , the potential @xmath4 presents a local minimum in @xmath5 and a local maximum in @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.potential ] ) .",
    "the local minimum is then separated from the local maximum by a potential barrier of size @xmath50 . if @xmath51 however , the potential is fully non - confining .",

    "we invite the reader to look at @xcite for a brief review on the dynamics of a one - dimensional diffusion in such a potential .    as in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the main difficulty to define such a hermitian process on the whole positive half line @xmath12 , comes from the fact that , with probability one , the diffusive matrix process @xmath59 satisfying will eventually blow - up at some finite time @xmath60 defined as @xmath61     particles ( red dots ) carrying positive charges in the potential @xmath62 as a function of @xmath63 for @xmath64 . ]    in @xcite , bloemendal and virg construct an hermitian diffusive process @xmath11 on the whole positive half line @xmath12 , satisfying a similar equation to off what they call the _ focal _ points ( see ( * ? ? ? * eq .",

    "they are interested in the case of a _ non stationary _ potentials similar to ours with an additional linear term @xmath65 in the drift ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "our case would simply corresponds to the @xmath67 case .",
