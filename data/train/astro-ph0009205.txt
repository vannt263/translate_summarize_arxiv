    "2000 ) with the criteria : ( 1 ) @xmath0 jy , ( 2 ) @xmath1 , and ( 3 ) @xmath2 ( darling & giovanelli 2000 ) . with a detection rate of 1 ohm in 6 candidates ,",
    "the complete survey will double the sample of ohms to roughly 100 objects .",
    "the survey has identified 35 new ohms in luminous infrared galaxies to add to the sample of 55 found in the literature .",
    "there is a strong bias for the most fir - luminous galaxies to host ohms , and a weak fir color dependence ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "ohms are detectable out to @xmath35 with modern instruments , and can thus be used to measure the high luminosity tail of the luminous ir galaxy luminosity function for redshifts spanning the epoch of major galaxy mergers ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "blank field surveys for ohms at various redshifts can also measure the galaxy merger rate as a function of cosmic time ( briggs 1998 ) .",
    "variability has been detected in several ohms , and is currently under investigation .",
    "the variability appears over time scales of months in individual spectral features rather than in broad - band modulation which could be attributed to antenna calibration or pointing errors .",
    "variability in ohms constrains the sizes of the variable and quiescent spectral features , regardless of the source of modulation ( intrinsic to the source or due to propagation effects ) .",
    "intrinsically variable regions would have sufficiently small angular sizes that they would also be expected to scintillate ( see walker 1998 ) .",
    "we thus attribute the variability to interstellar scintillation , which gives a weaker constraint on the sizes of emission regions than intrinsic variability .",
    "variability in ohms , particularly those with @xmath5 , will provide a powerful tool for understanding the small - scale physical settings and mechanisms of masers which can be observed at cosmological distances .",
