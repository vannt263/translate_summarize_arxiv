    "a summary of the characteristics are : * 1 ) * sba galaxies are the earliest of the true barred spiral forms , * 2 ) * the arms of an early sba are poorly defined , smooth in texture , broad and fuzzy , * 3 ) * the arms in a late sba are relatively narrow and well developed and some show signs of being resolved , are tightly wound and form nearly circular arcs that appear in projection as elliptical loops , * 4 ) * the spiral pattern can originate in two ways , either by emerging tangent to a complete internal ring at the edge of the lens , or by springing from the ends of the bar , * 5 ) * the bars are devoid of dust , are smooth in texture and have no trace of resolution into knots or stars , * 6 ) * lenses are found in 54% of sba galaxies but in none of late type ( sbc ) , * 7 ) * lenses tend to be triaxial , flattened ellipsoids , with a prefered equatorial axes ratio of @xmath31 , * 8) * half of sba galaxies have bars and lenses of the same size , * 9 ) * bulges are generally triaxial elongated perpendicular to the bar and in some cases elongated into a secondary nuclear bar , * 10 ) * bulges rotate very rapidly , * 11 ) * there is probably an ilr in the outer part of the bulge ( kormendy 1981 ) .",
    "observations of ngc 1415 clearly indicate smooth spiral arms starting from a boxy structure .",
    "the elongated bar shows a smooth texture and no signs of a dust lane or any individual knots .",
    "there is no clear evidence of a lens in ngc 1415 .",
    "these characteristics fully guaranty the classification as an sba galaxy , except that , as will be seen in @xmath9 5.2 , in order to reproduce the brightness distribution in the innermost regions and the boxy ishophotes our model only requires a small size spherically symmetric bulge rather than a large one .",
    "in order to reproduce the morphology of barred galaxies , numerical simulations of sparke & seelwood ( 1987 ) , combes et al . ( 1990 ) and athanassoula et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , employ a two - component initial distribution of particles , namely , a toomre s disk with a given surface density and a spherically symmetric plummer bulge - like component with its corresponding volume density .    in this section",
    "we describe our approach .",
    "we model a barred spiral galaxy using analytic functions consiting of three components , namely , a disk - like component , a spherical bulge , and a bar .      to model the observed surface brightness in ngc 1415 , three components are considered for its mass distribution : disk , bulge , and bar .",
    "the disk is represented with a classic oblate spheroid with similar strata ( i.e. the isodensity surfaces are aligned , concentric spheroids , all with the same axial ratio as that of the boundary surface ) . its density is given by the classic form ( schmidt 1956 ) :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are constants , @xmath35 is the major semi - axis of a similar spheroidal surface within the oblate spheroid , and @xmath36 is the equatorial radius of this spheroid . at the boundary @xmath37 the density of the disk is zero , so that @xmath38 .",
    "the bulge is considered spherically symmetric with a density function of the form given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) . instead of @xmath35 , however , the distance variable is now r , the distance to the galactic center .",
    "the constants are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and the radius of the bulge @xmath41 , at which point its density goes to zero .",
    "we found that a satisfactory fit to the observed optical brightness distribution in ngc 1415 requires a two - component bar .",
    "the bar in this case has a triaxial mass distribution , and its two components are : 1 ) an ellipsoidal mass distribution with similar strata , with density of the form given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) where the variable @xmath35 is the major semi - axis of an internal similar ellipsoid ; the associated constants are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( the density of this first component drops to zero at the boundary @xmath45 ) , and 2 ) a triaxial mass distribution whose isodensity surfaces are of the form    @xmath46    with constant ratios @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( i.e. similar surfaces ) and where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 are cartesian coordinates .",
    "( 2 ) is a special case of a generalized  ellipsoidal \" shape for a mass distribution .",
    "athanassoula et al .",
    "( 1990 ) have considered the generalized  ellipse \" to fit boxy isophotes in galaxies .",
    "the axes of the surfaces given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) are aligned with those of the first ellipsoidal component , the major axes pointing along the @xmath49 direction on the equatorial plane of the disk .",
    "the major semi - axis of this second component is @xmath52 .",
    "the reason to introduce this second component is the need to model the boxy isophotes observed in fig . 1 : by itself the projection on the plane of the sky of isodensity surfaces given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) produces isophotes of this type .",
    "a decreasing density function in the second component of the bar can take one of the three following forms ( @xmath53 ) :    @xmath54    the first form is the same as in the ellipsoidal component .",
    "note that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are different for the three forms , while @xmath57 in all cases .",
    "each component of the mass distribution ( disk , bulge and bar ) is considered to have its own position - independent mass - to - light ratio @xmath58 .",
    "both components of the bar have the same @xmath59 ( the mass - to - light ratio of the bar ) to keep the number of free parameters to a minimum . in fig .",
    "4 we show the three components of the system , and the line of sight with angular coordinates @xmath60 . the cartesian axes @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 are oriented as follows : the @xmath61 axis is perpendicular to the azimuthal plane defined by the axes @xmath51 , @xmath63 , while @xmath61 , @xmath62 axes define the plane of the sky . the centers of coordinates of both cartesian systems @xmath64 and @xmath65 coincide , being located at the galactic center .",
    "the inset only shows the center of the @xmath65 system displaced for the sake of clarity .",
    "the surface brightness of an ellipsoidal mass distribution with similar strata can be derived from the equations given by stark ( 1977 ) and binney ( 1985 ) . in this case , the surface brightness of the disk ( oblate spheroid ) , the bulge , and the first component of the bar , can be readily found .",
    "the main equations can be summarized as follows :    we call @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , the semi - axes ratio of the spheroid representing the disk .",

    "another interpretation ( less likely ) is that both the stars and ionized gas are on the same plane and the curved contours of continuum radiation would indicate different orbits caused somehow by the gravitational potential .",
    "each bright h@xmath10 spot lies at slighty different distance from the compact nucleus .",
    "the nw bright region lies at a distance of @xmath166 corresponding to a linear distance from the nucleus of @xmath167 pc .",
    "the se bright region lies at a distance of @xmath168 corresponding to a linear distance from the nucleus of @xmath169 pc .",
    "the two bright spots could themselves be in different planes from the circumnuclear ring .    in one interpretation the bright regions represent regions of density enhancement with a by - product of a burst of star formation where gas on disk orbits loses angular momentum and meets orbits trapped in the bar .",
    "gas continues losing angular momentum and is seen along the bar until it reaches _",
    "x_@xmath170 orbits and forms a circumnuclear structure seen more easily on the western side of the nucleus than on the eastern side .",
    "radio continuum emission has been detected from the central region of ngc 1415 by condon et al .",
    "their map shows a bright central emission with extensions in the northwest - southeast direction covering approximately the same area as our h@xmath0 image .",
    "however their angular resolution was not enough to resolve the emission from the compact nucleus and neither from any circumnuclear structure nor from the two bright h@xmath0 regions .",
    "another interpretation of the two bright h@xmath0 regions is that they represent a kind of bipolar emission from the nucleus and or circumnuclear ring .",
    "the two h@xmath10 bright sources would be slightly inclined with respect to the plane of the stellar disk .",
    "similar morphology has been observed in other galaxies as ngc 1068 ( bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "1997 ) and ngc 3367 ( graca - barreto et al .",
    "the radio continuum radiation should be found polarized only in the se region since the emission from the nw would be depolarized as it passes through the warm interstellar matter in the disk .",
    "observationally there is no h@xmath10 emission from the compact nucleus ( see fig .",
    "3 ) and it is difficult to say if there is any radio continuum emission , due to poor angular resolution in the maps of condon et al .",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    "further observations are needed to find out where the bright h@xmath10 sources lie : either on the plane of the sky or slightly inclined",
    ". a radio continuum map with higher angular resolution and polarization analysis would be necessary in order to study this .",
    "similarly , hi and co interferometric observations would be extremely useful in order to determine the atomic and molecular gas distributions .",
    "additionaly an optical rotation curve with fabry perot techniques would be extremely useful in order to determine the dynamical center of this galaxy .",
    "we have re - analyzed broadband and narrow band imaging observations of the central region of the barred spiral galaxy ngc  1415 from garca - barreto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . we have constructed a model for the mass distribution in the central region of ngc 1415 in order to approximate the observed optical surface brightness distribution .",
    "our model includes a disk , a spherically symmetric bulge ( @xmath171 pc ) and a two - component bar : one component to reproduce the elongated isophotes and a second component to reproduce the boxy - shaped isophotes .",
    "the ratio of the masses of the first component to the second component is 2.37 , a bar to disk luminosity ratio of 0.216 , and a bulge to disk luminosity ratio of 0.01 .",
    "if the mass to luminosity ratio is considered the same in the disk , bulge and bar , these results imply a ratio of masses of bulge to disk of 0.01 and bar to disk of 0.2 .",
    "our results suggest that a mass distribution with iso - density surfaces expressed as in eq .",
    "( 2 ) may be important to represent the central mass distribution in some barred galaxies .",
    "finally , we interpret the h@xmath0 emission as originating from a bipolar nuclear outflow slightly inclined with respect to the plane of the disk , although new observations are needed to confirm it .",
