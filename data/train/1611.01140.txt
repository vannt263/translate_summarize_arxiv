    "by now it is widely accepted that topological phases in condensed matter originate from the long - range entanglement existing in the system [ ] .",
    "tensor networks [ ] , which focus on the wave functions of the system instead of the hamiltonian , are generally considered as a natural tool to capture the behavior of long - range properties in a local way .",
    "the most successful examples of tensor network states include the matrix product states ( mps ) [ ] in 1d and the related projected entangled pair states [ ] in 2d , both of which serve as an efficient ansatz for ground states of topological phases in their respective dimensions .",
    "besides its popularity in studying strongly - correlated systems , entanglement and tensor networks have also attracted increasing attention from the high energy theory community , in various attempts of realizing [ ] the holographic [ ] ads / cft correspondence [ ] , and serving as a framework for loop quantum gravity [ ] .",
    "it is thus of theoretical interest to better understand the structures underlying tensor networks , so as to formulate a more definitive theoretical framework for describing quantum entanglement .",
    "this is the subject we are concerned about in this paper , exemplified with a description of long - range entanglement patterns in 2d topological phases .",
    "a tensor network is built from graphs consisting of interconnected tensors , imitating the structure of discrete lattices .",
    "the geometry of the network is generated by the pattern of interactions , namely , two sites in the network are close to each other if and only if they are entangled .",
    "every tensor living on the sites of the network can be understood as a building block of entanglement .    to illustrate , consider for example the celebrated aklt states [ ] in a spin-@xmath0 chain .",
    "such a state can be obtained from a `` parton '' or `` pardit '' construction .",
    "( the latter is a combination of `` parton''(matter ) and `` qudit '' ( information ) .",
    "later we will use it more often to emphasize the information aspect of entanglement . ) as in fig.[fig : aklt ] , one regards every spin-1 degrees of freedom on site @xmath1 as a composite object consisting of two spin-1/2 s at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and links each spin-1/2 spin on the site @xmath2(@xmath3 ) to its nearest neighbor on @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) with a singlet bond .",
    "one then projects into the physical subspace with a spin-1 degree of freedom at each site . from the perspective of representation theory ,",
    "the two spin-1/2 s @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be combined as @xmath6 .",
    "the operator @xmath7 which projects into the physical subspace annihilates the first term on the right hand side and keeps only the spin-1 representation : @xmath8    ( 0,0 ) circle [ radius=0.075 ] ; ( 1,0 ) circle [ radius=0.075 ] ; ( 0,0)(1,0 ) ;    ( 1.5,0 ) circle [ radius=0.075 ] ; ( 2.5,0 ) circle [ radius=0.075 ] ; ( 1.5,0)(2.5,0 ) ;    ( 3,0 ) circle [ radius=0.075 ] ; ( 4,0 ) circle [ radius=0.075 ] ; ( 3,0)(4,0 ) ;    ( 4.5,0 ) circle [ radius=0.075 ] ; ( 5.5,0 ) circle [ radius=0.075 ] ; ( 4.5,0)(5.5,0 ) ;    ( 6,0 ) circle [ radius=0.075 ] ; ( 6,0)(6.5,0 ) ; ( -0.5,0 ) circle [ radius=0.075 ] ; ( -1,0)(-0.5,0 ) ;    ( -.25,0 ) circle [ x radius=0.55 , y radius=0.3 ] ; ( 1.25,0 ) circle [ radius=0.55 , y radius=0.3 ] ; ( 2.75,0 ) circle [ radius=0.55 , y radius=0.3 ] ; ( 4.25,0 ) circle [ radius=0.55 , y radius=0.3 ] ; ( 5.75,0 ) circle [ radius=0.55 , y radius=0.3 ] ;    at ( 2.5,-0.5 ) @xmath2 ; at ( 3,-0.5 ) ; at ( 4,-0.5 ) ( n-1)@xmath9 ; at ( 1.5,-0.5 ) ;    the tensor network representation of the aklt state consists of tensors @xmath10 at every site of the lattice , where the index @xmath11 labels the _ physical _ spin-1 degrees of freedom on site @xmath1 , while @xmath12 label the auxiliary degrees of freedom associated with spin-1/2 _ pardits _ at @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the tensor @xmath13 can thus be understood as an adjoint map @xmath14 .",
    "mathematically , the fusion algebra @xmath6 is a realization of entanglement , in the sense that after the fusion , the quantum states can no longer be factored as a product state of its local constituents ( the spin-1/2 pardits ) .",
    "this is manifested in the tensor network states in two ways : ( i ) when viewed as the adjoint of the projection @xmath7 , the tensor @xmath10 provides a way to encode the entanglement between @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; ( ii ) contraction of tensors on neighboring sites projects pardits into singlets , and introduces entanglement across the adjacent sites @xmath2 and @xmath15 ( or @xmath3 and @xmath5 ) .    in two dimensions , there",
    "exist intrinsic topological orders not protected by any symmetry . following the discussion above",
    ", one would expect that in order to encode the entanglement of the topological phase in a tensor network , the structure of the tensors should be similar to that of a representation theory .",
    "namely , it should incorporate the fusion rules , or more precisely the fusion algebra .",
    "for an intrinsic topological phase we further require the entanglement to be long - range .",
    "the pattern of long - range entanglement is captured by the fixed - point tensor network states that are invariant under renormalization group ( rg ) transformations of the tensor network .",
    "one natural question thus arises : for a general tensor network state to capture the long - range physics and to be a rg fixed - point state , what are the constraints that need to be satisfied ?",
    "it turns out that in 2d , the input data for the tensor network indeed form a representation theory , in the form of a _ unitary fusion category_. in sec.[sec : cat ] we briefly review the algebraic definition of a unitary fusion category ( ufc ) . in sec.[subsec : catleft ] , we discuss how the ufc structure arises from the fixed - point properties of general triple - line tensor network states , followed by an examination of the converse of the question in sec.[subsec : catright ] , namely , the construction of fixed - point tensor network state from a given ufc .",
    "these tensors connect the mutually un - entangled pardits and the entangled physical degrees of freedom , thus serve as building blocks of entanglement .",
    "this completes the correspondence between ufc and fixed - point tensor network states .",
    "more generally in @xmath16 spatial dimensions , the corresponding representation theory is provided by higher @xmath16-category theory .    in sec.[sec",
    ": geo ] we provide a geometrical point - of - view on the structure of fixed - point tensor network states by appealing to 3d state - sum topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) . the long - range physics of a phase with topological order is described by a tqft [ ] .",
    "the state - sum construction [ ] of tqfts discretizes the underlying manifold into a `` lattice '' or `` graph '' , making explicit the locality of the theory .",
    "recently the correspondence between 1d fixed - point tenor network states and 2d state - sum tqft has been formulated rigorously [ ] . in one dimension higher , the state - sum construction of 3d tqft was proposed by turaev and viro [ ] and later generalized by barrett and westbury [ ] , which requires a ufc @xmath17 as the input data .",
    "given the input data and a triangulation of the 3d manifold @xmath18 , one can combinatorially define a topological invariant @xmath19 that is independent of the specific triangulation .",
    "when the underlying manifold @xmath18 contains open boundaries , the invariant @xmath19 can be understood as inner product between the initial and final spatial slices , or the transition amplitudes between the physical states that lies in the hilbert spaces on these two boundaries .",
    "interestingly , the tqft can be viewed as a holographic map from its 3d bulk to the 2d boundary . upon taking poincar duality",
    ", this map produces the desired fixed - point tensor network state . in this case",
    ", both the boundary and the bulk are gapped , in contrast to the holographic ads / cft correspondence where both are gapless .",
    "this is a new form of realization of the holographic principle : the description of a spacetime volume can be thought of as being encoded on a lower - dimensional boundary of the bulk region .",
    "the entanglement in the tensor network states on the boundary @xmath20 gives rise to an emergence of pre - geometry in the bulk .",
    "it is a pre - geometry in the graph - theoretical sense : it contains vertices that correspond to points in the spacetime and oriented edges connecting them , i.e. a specific triangulation .",
    "the stronger concept of emergent bulk _ geometry _ would further require the definition of a metric from entanglement measures in the tensor network . in section [ sec : symmetry ]",
    "we extend the framework to symmetric fixed - point tensor network states [ ] , which possesses a global onsite , finite , and unitary symmetry @xmath21 .",
    "the algebraic structure of these theories is given by @xmath21-extension of the ufc @xmath17 , while the pre - geometric structure is closely related to 3d homotopy quantum field theory [ ] .",
    "the construction is parallel to that of symmetry - enriched string - net models [ ] .",
    "to prepare for the discussion of structure of fixed - point tensor network states , in this section we briefly review the concept of a unitary fusion category ( ufc ) .",
    "a ufc @xmath17 is a set of data @xmath22 subject to some consistency conditions .",
    "@xmath23 is the set of ( isomorphism classes of ) simple objects in @xmath17 .",
    "we require a trivial object @xmath24 .",
    "for every @xmath25 there is a number @xmath26 called the quantum dimension of @xmath27 , with @xmath28 .",
    "the rank-3 tensor @xmath29 is a non - negative integer and describes the fusion rules between the objects @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "more specifically , the direct sum decomposition of the tensor product @xmath32 will include @xmath29 times the trivial object @xmath33 .",
    "it is this feature of tensor product decomposition that gives ufc the interpretation of a representation theory .",
    "we assume multiplicity - free fusion rules throughout the paper , which means that we restrict to the case of @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "we are also led to define the dual object @xmath36 as the only object that realizes @xmath37 .",
    "it satisfies @xmath38 and @xmath39 . finally , to every six objects @xmath40 we assign a quantum @xmath41-symbol , which is a rank-6 tensor @xmath42 ( relaxation of the multiplicity - free assumption",
    "would lead to four additional indices for the @xmath43-symbols )",
    ". we will assume full tetrahedral symmetry of the @xmath43-tensors : @xmath44 the number @xmath45 is the frobenius - schur indicator : @xmath46 .",
    "eigenvalue of a given object ( where @xmath13 is the time - reversal operator ) , can always be chosen to be @xmath0 for objects such that @xmath47 , and satisfy @xmath48 if @xmath49 . ]",
    "the three equal signs correspond to the three generators of the @xmath50 symmetric ( or tetrahedral ) group , thus the name tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "relaxing this condition leads to additional phase factors in the above equation that are the second or third roots of unity . in the case where the input data are finite groups",
    ", the relaxation of tetrahedral symmetry can lead to the dijkgraaf - witten construction [ ] and the twisted quantum double model [ ] based on three - cocycles , where time - reversal or(and ) parity symmetry can generically be broken . dropping",
    "the multiplicity - free condition and relaxing tetrahedral symmetry would complicate the problem , but we expect the main features of the correspondence to remain qualitatively the same .    for @xmath17 to be a ufc , the above tensors need to satisfy certain consistency conditions , including :    * compatibility of @xmath51 and @xmath29:@xmath52 * pentagon equation : @xmath53 * orthogonality : @xmath54    a useful identity that can be derived from above axioms is @xmath55    a ufc naturally arises from the representation theory of a finite group @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath56 . the elements in the label set @xmath23 correspond to irreducible representations of @xmath43 , and the @xmath29-tensor corresponds to the multiplicity of the representation @xmath57 in the direct sum decomposition of the tensor product @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath43-tensors are simply the racah @xmath41 symbols of the group representation .",
    "more generally , a ufc is the representation category of a @xmath59-weak hopf algebra .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate the correspondence between fixed - point tensor network states and ufcs from an algebraic point of view .",
    "part [ subsec : catleft ] derives the structure of the category from the fixed - point property of tensor network states , while part [ subsec : catright ] deals with the converse .",
    "an example of a general 2d tensor network is displayed in fig.[fig : examplepeps ] .",
    "the tensors living on the vertices of the graph have one physical index @xmath60 that extends into the third dimension ( out of the paper ) , as well as @xmath61 indices that correspond to internal degrees of freedom living on the links ( @xmath27 s ) and plaquettes ( @xmath62 s ) of the graph , which are auxiliary and are to be summed over .",
