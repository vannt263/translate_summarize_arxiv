    "recent _ ab initio _ theoretical studies of the structure and spectroscopy of octahedral complexes of lanthanide / actinide ions have shown that the bond length between the and the surrounding ligands shortens upon @xmath6 excitation .",
    "@xcite this is so for different halide ligands ( f , cl , br ) , environments ( crystals , liquid solutions , gas phase ) , oxidation states of the @xmath7 ion ( iii , iv ) , and number of @xmath8 electrons ( across the lanthanide / actinide series ) .",
    "@xcite yet , it contradicts the widespread assumption that  excitations lengthen the impurity - ligand bonds .",
    "@xcite    usually , the materials involving @xmath8-element ion complexes are liquid or solid solutions and a direct experimental proof of the bond shortening could be obtained , in principle , by means of ground ( @xmath7 ) and excited state ( @xmath9 ) exafs measurements . in this respect ,",
    "a theoretical study of ( cex@xmath1)@xmath2 ( x= f , cl , br ) complexes in cubic elpasolites , liquid acetonitrile solution , and gas phase , has pointed out the chloride and bromide complexes in acetonitrile as good candidates for excited state exafs experiments because the negative bond length shifts are largest and the liquid medium could favor the experimental setting .",
    "@xcite however , excited state exafs measurements are extremely demanding because the difficulties inherent to exafs experiments and their interpretation are extended by the need of pumping the samples onto the excited @xmath9 levels for long periods of time and by the uncertainties on the actual excited state population attained . as a matter of fact",
    ", no successful experiments of this kind have yet been reported in octahedral complexes of @xmath8 element ions in solid or liquid media , to our knowledge .    in this paper , on the basis of quantum chemical simulations , we propose that spectroscopic studies under high hydrostatic pressure  @xcite are an alternative , relatively simple experimental technique to proof or reject the predicted bond length shortening upon @xmath6 excitation . in effect , quantum chemical calculations in 6 :  reveal that the shortening in bond length upon @xmath6 excitation results in a continuous redshift of the transition energy with pressure in the range 1 bar  26 kbar . more generally , the sign of the bond length change upon excitation determines the sign of the slope of the transition energy with pressure . as a consequence",
    ", the theoretically found sequence of bond lengths in octahedral complexes ,  @xcite @xmath10 @xmath10 , consistently leads to deacreasing , constant , and increasing transition energies with hydrostatic pressure .",
    "these results also enhance the value of high pressure experiments to alter the relative positions of excited states  @xcite and to help the usually difficult assignment of the @xmath11 highest energy levels .",
    "the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the local structure and electronic transitions of the  defects in 6   were studied using the relativistic  model potential ( aimp ) embedded cluster method .",
    "@xcite more detailed descriptions of the method , as applied to @xmath8 element ions in ionic crystals , can be found in refs .   and  .",
    "the effective core potentials used for ce  @xcite and cl  @xcite in an experimental and theoretical study of the absorption and emission spectra of  in elpasolite lattices  @xcite were also used here to incorporate scalar relativistic effects . in order to include dynamic electron correlation",
    ", scf calculations were performed on the 4@xmath12 and 5@xmath13 electronic states and were used as reference for second order perturbation calculations where 57 valence electrons were correlated that occupy molecular orbitals with main character ce 5@xmath14 , 5@xmath15 , 4@xmath8/5@xmath16 and cl 3@xmath14 , 3@xmath15 .",
    "@xcite ( the scf results of the structure and pressure - induced shifts of electronic transitions are in qualitative agreement with those presented here ; therefore , the predictions made in this paper already hold qualitatively at that level of theory . )",
    "the effects of pressure were modelled by using the aimp embedding potentials produced in a recent study of high pressure effects on the structure and spectroscopy of  defects in 6 .",
    "@xcite the embedding potentials corresponding to a given lattice constant were obtained through self - consistent embedded ions calculations ;  @xcite they allow to incorporate quantum mechanical interactions with the host 6  ions in the  cluster hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite the values of the lattice constant used are listed in table  [ tab : one ] , where the corresponding @xmath17 values are also shown .",
    "these data define a pressure range ( see table  [ tab : one ] ) if the isothermal compressibility of the material is    since  substitute for  ions that occupy @xmath18 sites the embedded cluster energies of all electronic states in the @xmath12 ( the ground state @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) configurations were calculated at different ce - cl distances , r , for each lattice compression ( there has been no reports of significant coupling to jahn - teller active normal modes ) .",
    "the plots of the potential energy surfaces for ambient pressure and 26  kbar are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] .",
    "we obtained the equilibrium distances , , and totally symmetric vibrational frequencies , , as in ref .  ; the vertical ( @xmath24 ) and minimum - to - minimum ( @xmath25 ) transition energies , and the shifts of bond length that occur upon excitation ( @xmath26 ) were also obtained and are presented in table  [ tab : one ] and figures  [ fig : pes ] to [ fig : deltaevsr ] .",
    "the results in table  [ tab : one ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] show that the ce@xmath27cl bond length shortens upon @xmath28  d@xmath29 excitation at ambient pressure and at higher pressures as well .",
    "figures  [ fig : pes ] and [ fig : peffects ] reveal a redshift of the @xmath28  d@xmath29 transition with pressure .",
    "both observations are connected : the sign of the bond length shift determines the sign of the slope of the electronic transition with pressure , being both of them negative , for the @xmath28  d@xmath29 transition .",
    "this connection can be established as follows . on the one hand ( see fig  [ fig : deltaevsr ] ) , the slope of the calculated transition energy @xmath24 with the ce@xmath27cl distance r , @xmath30 , varies little with pressure ( see solid lines ) and has the same sign as ( and is very similar to ) the slope of the minimum - to - minimum transition energy @xmath25 with the ce@xmath27cl equilibrium distance of the ground state , @xmath31 .",
    "the same is true for the slope of the vertical , frank - condon transition @xmath32 $ ] with @xmath33 , @xmath34/dr_e(^2a_{2u})$ ] .",
    "furthermore , the observations and conclusions drawn from fig  [ fig : deltaevsr ] also apply to any other @xmath35 transition studied here , so that @xmath36 and their magnitude is similar . on the other hand , it has been shown  @xcite that when the force constant of the initial and final states are similar , @xmath37 , like it is the case here ( note that  values are given in table  [ tab : one ] and @xmath38@xmath39 for the @xmath40 normal mode ) the slope of the transition energy @xmath41 depends basically on the force constant @xmath42 and on the bond length shift @xmath43 , accompanying the transition , as follows :  @xcite this , together with the previous observations ( eq .",
    "1 ) , and the fact that @xmath44 , leads to the conclusion that the sign of the slope of a transition with pressure coincides with the sign of the bond length shift that occurs upon excitation : @xmath45 and the same is true for the frank - condon transition . in effect",
    "( fig  [ fig : peffects ] , table  [ tab : one ] ) , the transitions ( with @xmath46 ) are quite insensitive to pressure , @xmath47 transitions ( with @xmath48 ) shift to the red , and @xmath49 excitations ( with @xmath50 ) shift to higher energies with pressure .",
    "it is known , from transition metal spectroscopy , that the so called 10@xmath51 transition ,  @xcite @xmath52@xmath53@xmath54 , shifts to high energy values with pressure ,  @xcite which is related to the bond length increase upon @xmath52@xmath53@xmath54 excitation ( eq .",
    "2 ) ; the same behavior is obtained here for @xmath55 @xmath53 @xmath56 ( table  [ tab : one ] , fig  [ fig : peffects ] ) .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that this information alone does not suffice to infer the effects of pressure on the @xmath57 transitions ; rather , the position of both potential energy surfaces @xmath55 and @xmath56 relative to the potential energy surface of the @xmath7 ground state in the r axis of the configurational diagram , has to be also known .",
    "@xcite these relative positions have been found to be @xmath10 @xmath10 by calculations here and elsewhere , as commented above ,  @xcite and have been interpreted as resulting from the following simple model of interactions : the inner lanthanide ( ln ) ( or actinide , an ) @xmath7 open - shell electrons are shielded from the ligands by the outer ln 5@xmath58 ( an 6@xmath58 ) closed - shell electrons , whose interactions with the ligands determine the bond distance in states of @xmath7 configuration .",
    "instead , upon @xmath7@xmath53@xmath9 excitation one electron has crossed the 5@xmath58 ( 6@xmath58 ) barrier and becomes exposed to covalent interactions with the ligands , at the same time that it leaves a 4@xmath8 ( 5@xmath8 ) hole behind , available for charge transfer from the ligands , both of which contribute to shortening the bond length between the @xmath9 baricenter and the ligands .",
    "finally , a large @xmath16(@xmath59)-@xmath16(@xmath60 ) octahedral ligand splitting shortens the @xmath55 bond lengths clearly below the @xmath7 ones ( @xmath61  @xmath620 ) and raises the @xmath56 ones clearly above them ( @xmath61  @xmath630 ) .",
    "@xcite these bond length shifts ultimately lead to the predicted red shift of @xmath12@xmath53@xmath64 and increase of @xmath12@xmath53@xmath65 transitions with pressure in 6 : .",
    "should the sequence of bond lengths be that traditionally assumed : both transitions would increase with pressure . whether the former or the latter sequence of bondlengths actually occurs could be revealed by performing high pressure spectroscopic experiments on this model system 6:in the range 1 bar  26 kbar . from all the results we have discussed here it is possible to derive a rule of thumb that can be applied to predict the sign of the change of a transition with pressure .",
    "it consists of using the calculated configurational diagram for ambient pressure ( dashed lines in fig  [ fig : pes ] , for instance ) and use it assuming that the effects of pressure simply correspond to moving inwards across the r axis .",
    "this approximation applies as a consequence of eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which is a manifestation that the major effect of pressure on these local electronic transitions is a moderate decrease of the f - element  ligand distance .",
    "previous  wavefunction based studies of the structure and spectroscopy of octahedral complexes of @xmath8 element ions in crystals , liquid solutions , and gas phase have shown that the bond length between the @xmath8-element and the ligands shortens upon @xmath6 excitation .",
    "this result contradicted the widespread assumption that the bond length is longer in the @xmath9 states .",
    "no experimental proof of the actual sign of the bond length change upon excitation has been given .",
    "we have presented here a quantum chemical simulation of spectroscopic experiments under high hydrostatic pressure .",
    "the simulation includes scalar relativistic effects , second order perturbation treatment of the valence electron correlation , and quantum mechanical embedding techniques .",
    "a continuous redshift of the lowest @xmath66 band of 6 :  with pressure is predicted in the range 1  bar to 26  kbar .",
    "the pressure - induced redshift is shown to be related to the bond length shortening that accompanies the @xmath47 excitation .",
    "therefore , the simulation points to the experimental detection of the pressure induced redshift as a way to support ( or reject ) the bond length shortening .",
    "more generally , the calculations suggest that the sign of the bond length change upon excitation determines the sign of the pressure - induced shift of the transition , and the effects of pressure on the @xmath67 ( no shift ) and @xmath68 ( shift to higher energies ) transitions are also predicted and are related to the respective negligible and positive changes in bond length . the 6 :  crystal",
    "is pointed out as an ideal model system for the counterpart high pressure experimental studies because the higher @xmath69 band has been observed below the cutoff of the host absorption .",
