    "+ the standard model(sm)provides an excellent effective field theory description of almost all particle physics experiments .",
    "but in the sm the higgs boson mass suffers from an instability under radiative corrections .",
    "the naturalness argument suggests that the cutoff scale of the sm is not much above the electroweak scale : new physics will appear around tev energies . among the extended models beyond the sm , the little higgs model offers a very promising solution to the hierarchy problem in which the higgs boson is naturally light as a result of nonlinearly realized symmetry @xcite .",
    "the key feature of this kind of models is that the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson of an approximate global symmetry which is spontaneously broken by a vacuum expectation value(vev ) at a scale of a few tev and thus is naturally light . + the most economical little higgs model is the littlest higgs(lh ) model , which is based on the @xmath4 nonlinear sigma model @xcite .",
    "it consists of a @xmath5 global symmetry , which is spontaneously broken down to @xmath6 by a vacuum condensate @xmath7 . in the lh model , a set of new heavy gauge bosons@xmath8 and a new heavy - vector - like quark(t )",
    "are introduced which just cancel the quadratic divergence induced by sm gauge boson loops and the top quark loop , respectively .",
    "the distinguishing features of this model are the existence of these new particles and their couplings to the light higgs .",
    "measurement of these couplings would verify the structure of the cancelation of the higgs mass quadratic divergence and prove the existence of the little higgs mechanism@xcite .",
    "+ the hunt for the higgs boson and investigation of its properties is one of the most important goals of present and future high energy collider experiments .",
    "the precision electroweak measurement data and direct searches suggest that the higgs boson must be relative light and its mass should be roughly in the range of 114.4gev-208gev at @xmath9 cl @xcite . studying the properties of the higgs potential will reveal details of the mass - generation mechanism in spontaneously broken gauge theories , which can be obtained through measuring the higgs boson self - interactions .",
    "recently , the higgs boson pair production processes have been widely considered , and the cross sections for these processes in the sm have been evaluated at linear colliders and hadron colliders . the phenomenology calculation show that it would be extremely difficult to measure the higgs self - coupling @xmath10 at the lhc @xcite , and @xmath1 linear colliders , where the study of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be performed with good accuracy , represent a possibly unique opportunity for performing the study of the trilinear higgs self - coupling @xcite . for the center of mass(c.m.)energy @xmath13 from 500 gev up to 1 tev , the @xmath14 production with intermediate higgs boson mass is the most promising process among the various higgs doublet - production processes .",
    "since the cross section is relatively large and all the final states can be identified without large missing momentum , the process @xmath0 is the best one among the various higgs doublet - production processes to look for the higgs self - coupling during the first stage of the future linear collider . + we know that the most important higgs production process at the linear collider is the higgs - strahlung process @xmath15 .",
    "the correction effects of lh model to this process was studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is found that the correction effects mainly come from the heavy gauge boson @xmath16 , in most parameter space , the deviation of the total cross section from its sm value is larger than @xmath17 , which may be detected at the future ilc experiment .",
    "however , the double higgs - strahlung process @xmath11 includes the trilinear higgs coupling which is different from the process @xmath15 . for the process @xmath11",
    ", the contribution of the lh model comes from not only the new heavy gauge bosons @xmath18 but also the modification of the self - couplings of higgs boson .",
    "so the process @xmath11 can also provide some useful information about the modification of trilinear higgs coupling in the lh model to complement the study of the process @xmath19 .",
    "in this paper , we consider the double higgs - strahlung process @xmath11 and study whether the correction effects of lh model to this process can be detected at the future ilc experiment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows , in section two , we first briefly introduce the lh model , and then give the production amplitude of the process .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are presented in section three .",
    "our conclusions are given in section four .",
    "+ the lh model is based on the @xmath4 nonlinear sigma model . at the scale @xmath21@xmath7 , the global @xmath5 symmetry is broken into its subgroup @xmath6 via a vacuum condensate @xmath7 , resulting in 14 goldstone bosons .",
    "the effective field theory of these goldstone bosons is parameterized by a non - linear @xmath22 model with gauged symmetry @xmath23^{2}$ ] , spontaneously broken down to its diagonal subgroup @xmath24 which is identified as the sm electroweak gauge group .",
    "four of these goldstone bosons are eaten by the broken gauge generators , leaving 10 states that transform under the sm gauge group as a doublet h and a triplet @xmath25 .",
    "this breaking scenario also gives rise to four massive gauge bosons @xmath16 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which might produce characteristic signatures in the present and future high energy collider experiments @xcite .",
    "+ after ewsb , the final mass eigenstates are obtained via the mixing between the heavy and light gauge bosons .",

    "the mass of the heavy gauge boson @xmath26 is larger than 1 tev .",
    "so , there is no s - channel resonance effects in our numerical results . +    to see the dependence of the relative correction on the parameter @xmath98 , in fig.3 , we plot @xmath90 as a function of the mixing parameter @xmath98 for c=0.3 , @xmath99 and three values of the scale parameter @xmath7 . from fig.3",
    "we can see that , the absolute value of the relative correction decreases as @xmath7 increasing . the curves also demonstrate that the effect of the lh model is not sensitive to @xmath98 in the range of @xmath100 .",
    "this is because the deviations of the cross section from the sm are mainly aroused by the contributions of the new gauge bosons when @xmath100 .",
    "however , the figure shows that the absolute values of @xmath90 raised quickly when we take the @xmath101 limit and in this case the main contribution to the cross section comes from the feynman diagram involving the trilinear interaction of the sm higgs boson , which is consistent with the conclusions for the contributions of the lh model to higgs boson pair production at hadron colliders @xcite .",

    "one can see that the absolute relative correction drops sharply with @xmath7 increasing , which is consistent with the conclusions for the corrections of the lh model to other observables . on the other hand",
    ", we can see that the absolute relative correction increases as the parameter @xmath98 increasing .",
    "for example , the absolute relative correction may reach about @xmath107 when @xmath108 and @xmath109 tev .",
    "+ as has been mentioned above , the total cross section of @xmath11 can reach the order of @xmath110 fb at the ilc .",

    "the sensitivity can be further improved when a multi - variable selection based on a neural network is applied which can reduce the uncertainty from @xmath114 to @xmath115 .",
    "the relative correction of the lh model to the cross section is only comparable to the ilc measurement precision and might be detected at the ilc in the favorable parameter spaces(for example , small value of @xmath7 ) preferred by the electroweak precision .",
