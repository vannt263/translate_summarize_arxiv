    "be / x - ray binaries are stellar systems in which a neutron star accretes material from a massive , early - type star with a circumstellar disc .",
    "typically they have wide , eccentric orbits with x - ray outbursts occurring when the neutron star interacts with the circumstellar material of the be star .",
    "two predominant types of outburst behaviour are observed : type i outbursts of luminosities in the range @xmath0@xmath1ergs@xmath2 last a few days and generally occur close to periastron , while type ii outbursts last much longer , reach higher luminosities ( @xmath3ergs@xmath2 ) and show no correlation with orbital phase .",
    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is home to an unusually large population of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "based on the relative masses of the milky way and the smc , there are a factor 50 more in the smc than one would expect .",
    "( although the sample of hmxbs in the milky way is by no means complete , as can be evidenced by the recent discoveries of numerous obscured x - ray binaries @xcite , we do not expect the population to increase by a factor of 50 ) .",
    "population synthesis simulations by @xcite show that the reduced metallicity of the smc ( @xmath4one - fifth solar ) can lead to an increase in the hmxb population by a factor of three .",
    "the metallicity is particularly relevant in influencing the evolution of massive stars , due to the impact it has on stellar winds .",
    "the line - driven stellar winds in massive stars become weakened in low metallicity environments @xcite , resulting in lower mass and angular momentum losses from the binary systems in which they are present .",
    "such angular momentum losses may be reflected in both the final mass of the compact object and the evolutionary path of the binary , i.e. whether or not the binary is disrupted by the supernova kick .",
    "however , on its own , the reduced metallicity of the smc can not explain the large number of hmxb systems in this galaxy @xcite .",
    "a recent increase in the star formation rate , such as required by @xcite , possibly due to tidal interaction between the smc and its nearest neighbour the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , is necessary to explain this excess of hmxbs .",
    "this is further substantiated by the results of @xcite , which have shown that the number of hmxb systems in a galaxy can be related to the galactic star formation rate . using indicators such as the far infrared , h@xmath5 and ultraviolet to predict the number of hmxbs in the smc @xcite",
    ", one finds that star formation rate alone can not account for the number of hmxbs discovered so far in the smc .",
    "hence , it seems likely that the increased star formation rate in the smc combined with the reduced metallicity environment have given rise to the large observed population of hmxbs .    with the advent of arcsecond resolution x - ray telescopes the number of",
    "optically identified be / x - ray binaries ( all but one of the hmxbs in the smc are be / x - ray binaries ) in the smc has risen dramatically over the last few years .",
    "as there are clear differences in the numbers of hmxbs between the milky way and smc , which can be ascribed to metallicity and star formation , there may be other notable differences in the populations .",
    "most fundamentally , how do the metallicity and star formation rate reflect on the spectral distribution of the optical counterparts to the be / x - ray binary population of the smc ?",
    "although their x - ray properties are well - studied , the spectral classifications of only five of the be / x - ray binaries in the smc are known @xcite . an accurate spectral distribution of smc sources can provide constraints on the evolutionary models put forward to explain the spectral distribution of be / x - ray binaries .",
    "in addition , it may reflect the lower metallicity of the smc and thus provide valuable insights into both binary evolution and star formation in a metal - poor environment .",
    "@xcite showed that the spectral distribution of be stars occurring in be / x - ray binary systems is significantly different from that of isolated be stars in the milky way .",
    "whereas isolated galactic be stars show a distribution beginning at the early b - types and continuing through until a0 , the be star companions of x - ray binaries show a clear cutoff near spectral type b2 .",
    "figure  [ figgal ] shows the spectral distribution of milky way isolated be stars ( dashed histogram ) compared with the milky way be / x - ray binaries ( solid histogram ) .",
    "the be / x - ray binary data used in the histogram are shown in table  [ tabmwspectypes ] , while the data used for the distribution of isolated be stars are from @xcite with a magnitude limit of @xmath6 .",
    "such a magnitude cutoff basically preselects the early - type be stars and thus we expect that the true distribution may peak towards later - types than shown in fig  [ figgal ] .        lll name & spectral type & ref + 4u 0115 + 634 & b0.2 v & ( 1 ) + rx  j0146.9 + 6121 & b1 v & ( 2 ) + igr  j01363 + 6610 & b1 & ( 3 ) + lsi+61@xmath7  303 & b0 v & ( 4 ) + v0332 + 53 & o89 v & ( 5 ) + 4u 0352 + 30 & b0 v & ( 6 ) + rx j0440.9 + 4431 & b0 v & ( 7 ) + a 0535 + 262 & b0 iii & ( 8) + sax j0653 + 0533 & b2 v ",

    "the objects are drawn from @xcite , with the exception of those that have no known well - defined x - ray position .",
    "we also exclude sxp0.72(=smc  x-1 ) , which we know to be a roche - lobe overflowing supergiant system , and sxp8.02 , which is now known to be an anomalous x - ray pulsar @xcite .",

    "column 4 gives a literature reference for x - ray error circle or optical identification . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 1)@xcite ( 2)@xcite ( 3)@xcite    the spectral distribution of smc be / x - ray binaries is shown in fig .",
    "[ figsmcspecdist ] with individual spectral types given in table  [ tabcolours ] .",
    "our procedure for the binning of stars where we were unable to constrain the spectral type to one subtype involved allocating the object fractionally to the spectral classes within the estimated spectral range of the source . for example , sxp82.4 which can be constrained to the b1b3 range translates into the histogram as @xmath11 b1 , @xmath11 b2 and @xmath11 b3 .",
    "the distribution shows a similarity to the spectral distributions of the galactic @xcite and lmc @xcite be / x - ray binaries .",
    "the spectral distribution of be / x - ray binary counterparts in the smc peaks at spectral type b1 , compared to the lmc and galaxy distributions , which peak at b0 .",
    "the galactic and lmc distributions show a sharp cutoff at b2 , whereas there are 5 smc objects with _",
    "possible _ spectral types beyond b2 , but as one can see from table  [ tabcolours ] the exact spectral type can not be determined with certainty in these cases .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test of the difference between the smc and galactic distributions gives a k - s statistic @xmath12 , indicating that the null hypothesis ( which is that the two distributions are the same ) can not be rejected even at significances as low as 90% .",
    "hence , it is likely that both galactic and smc be / x - ray binary counterparts are drawn from the same population .    the most noteworthy selection effect , which may mask the real distribution of spectral types in the smc , is magnitude related : fainter stars , which are most likely to be those of later b - types , are the most difficult to observe and classify .",
    "table  [ tabcolours ] shows that the latest spectral types observed among the smc systems are those of sxp74.7 ( @xmath4b3 ) and sxp101 ( b3b5 ) . although sxp74.7 is faint , spectral types of stars much fainter than sxp101 have been confidently determined .",
    "thus , there seems very little evidence that magnitude related selection effects have influenced our sample .",
    "a second factor reduces the number of optical counterparts included in our sample in the first place : this is related to those smc x - ray pulsars which do not as yet have an identified optical counterpart .",
    "this is predominantly an effect of large uncertainties on the positions of pulsars as measured by non - imaging x - ray satellites , and we do not expect the absence of these objects in our sample to introduce spectral type selection effects .",
    "a number of authors @xcite suggest the possibility that be stars in x - ray binaries may be a product of binary evolution . during mass transfer",
    "the secondary star , or at least its outer layers , may be spun up @xcite . as it is well - known that the be phenomenon is closely associated with high stellar rotational velocities @xcite it is not far - fetched to suppose that such binary mass transfer may rejuvenate the secondary star and , somehow , give rise to the be phenomenon .",
    "studies of be stars in clusters @xcite indicate that most cases of the be phenomenon may be brought about by spin - up processes in close binaries , rather than be stars being born as fast rotators or being spun - up in the final stages of their main sequence lives",
    ".    such a model of rejuvenation may also account for the narrow spectral distribution of be / x - ray binaries . in population synthesis models",
    "@xcite includes the effects of both supernova kick velocities and angular momentum loss through the @xmath13 point .",
    "he finds that this angular momentum leakage is just as influential in restricting the final number of be binary pulsars as the effect of a supernova kick and , in addition , that angular momentum loss restricts the spectral distribution of the be star companions .",
    "@xcite shows clearly that a higher loss of angular momentum restricts the mass of the be star counterparts to @xmath14 , i.e. to spectral types earlier than  b2 v @xcite .",
    "this is caused by the fact that binary systems holding late - type stars , which have smaller mass ratios , tend to undergo a spiralling - in effect when mass is lost through the @xmath13 point @xcite . in these cases",
    "the components may merge or form a common envelope .",
    "whatever the eventuality in such a case , it is clear that a be neutron star system will not be the outcome .",
    "@xcite have shown that be / x - ray binaries in the lmc follow the same distribution as those in the milky way , and this work ( see fig .",
    "[ figsmcspecdist ] ) shows that the spectral distribution of be / x - ray binaries in the smc is also consistent with that of the milky way systems .",
    "although no major spectral survey of be stars in the smc has been performed , preliminary results @xcite obtained from photometric colours of @xmath15 emission line stars indicate that the spectral distribution of isolated be stars in the smc is similar to that in the galaxy . hence , at this time we can not exclude the possibility that isolated be stars in the smc may have a different spectral distribution from those in the milky way .",
    "figure  [ figport7 ] shows the arbitrarily scaled spectral distribution of smc be / x - ray binaries superimposed on the predicted spectral distribution of be / x - ray binaries ( from @xcite ) . as with the milky way and lmc distributions ,",
    "the smc distribution cuts off around spectral type b2 ( @xmath16m@xmath17 ) , indicating that there may be significant angular momentum losses in the binary system prior to the be / x - ray binary evolutionary phase .",
    "a possible interpretation of the fact that there is no significant metallicity dependence of the spectral distributions of be / x - ray binaries is that the angular momentum is lost through mechanisms other than the stellar winds of early - type components of these systems .",
    "for example , as @xcite infers , the mass may be lost through the @xmath13 point during the initial phase of mass transfer which serves to spin up the star to be star status .",
    "it is also worth noting that there are no smc be / x - ray binaries with masses greater than @xmath18m@xmath17 .",
    "this may be due to the fact that heavier systems go on to become supergiant x - ray binaries , which have lifetimes significantly shorter than the be / x - ray systems and are consequently less abundant ( there is only one in the smc ",
