    "as a result of anisotropic gravitational instability , the matter distribution of the universe at large scale exhibits an intrinsic pattern , known as the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "this particular structure , characterized by a network of filaments , sheets and empty voids , has repeatedly been revealed by various observations , including the large scale galaxies distribution from galaxies surveys @xcite and the dark matter map inferred from weak lensing survey @xcite . in this regard ,",
    "the presence of this structure in both numerical simulations and analytical models , e.g. the zeldovich approximation ( za , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , highlights our achievement of understanding the process of structure formation .    besides its significance in the theory of large - scale structure",
    ", the cosmic web also serves as an environment for small scale structures like halos and galaxies .",
    "various observations suggest that many galaxy properties vary with this environment systematically @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , high - resolution numerical simulations also show clear correlations between halo properties , like concentration and spin , with the local environment @xcite .",
    "hence , it is essential to define properly and better understand this morphological environment and its time evolution .",
    "although this web structure originates from anisotropic initial random field @xcite and is qualitatively well described by simple analytical model like za , its evolution , however , is highly nonlinear at later epoch .",
    "consequently , many efforts have been concentrated on developing algorithms of morphology classification for numerically simulated data .",
    "at least two categories of such algorithms exist in literatures , one is geometrical method , which tries to establish a mathematical description based on the point samples of galaxies / halos or dark matter particles in simulations @xcite",
    ". the other ` dynamical / kinematic ' approach then considers the movement of a test particle in the inhomogeneous gravitational potential , which could either be described by the hessian matrix of gravitational potential @xcite or the velocity gradient tensor @xcite .",
    "various morphologies can then be identified by the number of eigenvalues greater than some threshold value .    in zeldovich s structure formation theory @xcite , these two tensors are simply proportional to each other , and therefore provide identical morphology classification . however , once the universe enters into the nonlinear regime , differences start to emerge . with a similar level of smoothing and comparable eigenvalue thresholds",
    ", @xcite showed that the velocity based algorithm provides very different morphologies than the gravitational potential based technique and seems to resolve smaller structures ( also in figure .",
    "[ fig : t_v_sim_snapshot ] for zero eigenvalue threshold ) .",
    "however , the reason of such dissimilarity is not clear , and theoretical investigation is highly demanded .",
    "furthermore , instead of the null eigenvalue threshold first utilized by @xcite , subsequent studies in general assume a nonzero threshold which is usually artificially tuned to provide the best visual impression . for gravitational potential based cosmic web , @xcite suggested that the threshold value of properly normalized tensor should be around unity based on the argument of spherical collapse .",
    "however , the justification requires more detailed study on the classification schemes and cosmic evolution of both tensors .",
    "compared with geometrical methods , where algorithmic procedures usually prevent them from further analytical understandings , one advantage of considering the dynamical variables is the potential to quantitatively investigate the cosmic web evolution , which however , has not been fully appreciated yet .",
    "one of the obstacles is the less - convenient eigenvalue representation of the algorithm . on the other hand , it is equivalent to study the eigenvalues and the rotational invariant coefficients of the characteristic equation of the tensor @xcite .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the most important advantage of this parameter space is to avoid the complex domain after the tensor become non - symmetric .",
    "however , even for the purpose of this paper , where only the symmetric part is of interest , it will still be convenient to work in this invariant space .",
    "especially , when the trace of the tensor does not change the sign , a two - dimensional subspace would suffice to present morphological evolution .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is therefore to investigate theoretically in this invariant space , the nonlinear evolution of the velocity gradient tensor and the hessian matrix of gravitational potential .",
    "furthermore , to compare with geometrical algorithm , we will examine the evolution of the deformation tensor as well .",
    "to this end , we adopt the lagrangian approach to track the dynamical evolution of relevant variables of a fluid element , including the density , the velocity gradient and the tidal tensor .",
    "however in newtonian theory ( nt ) , the evolution equation of the tidal tensor is missing .",
    "an alternative approach , as discussed by @xcite ( hereafter denotes as ` bj94 ' ) , instead starts from the full general relativistic description , where the lagrangian evolution equations and constraints of gravitational fields are well - known .",
    "specifically , the evolution equation of the counterpart of the tidal tensor , i.e. the electric part of weyl tensor , can be derived from the bianchi identities .",
    "however , the treatment of the magnetic part of this tensor in nt is unclear and therefore triggered many discussions @xcite . nevertheless , in the current paper , we will simply adopt the approach same as @xcite , assuming the vanishing magnetic part of weyl tensor , which produces a set of self - consistent @xcite closed ordinary differential equations .    in this model ,",
    "the interaction of tensor perturbations between neighboring fluid elements is neglected , therefore also known as the ` silent universe ' model . since nt is intrinsically nonlocal as the potential is determined by the matter distribution everywhere via poisson equation , a non - general relativistic theory with an extra time evolution equation of the tidal tensor should be regarded as some extension of nt , a closer approximation to the general relativity @xcite . practically , assuming a vanishing magnetic part of weyl tensor",
    "would dramatically simplify the formalism @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , one obvious shortage of the lagrangian approach is the existence of the singularity at the shell - crossing .",
    "it sets the validity range of the method much earlier than the formation of virialized objects .",
    "fortunately , for our purpose , it is equally , if not more , important to study the underdense perturbations as the visual impression of the cosmic morphologies is highly weighted by the lower dense regions for their greater volume filling factors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we first briefly revisit two types of cosmic classification algorithms and then introduce the definition of rotational invariants as well as the geometrical quantities related to the deformation tensor . in section 3 , we discuss lagrangian dynamical evolution models .",
    "we first show the analytical results of invariants evolution in zeldovich approximation in section 3.1 and then review bj94 s nonlinear local evolution model in section 3.2 before deriving the basic equation for obtaining the deformation tensor .",
    "we present our result in section 4 by first comparing the zeldovich approximation and the nonlinear local model .",
    "we then discuss the differences between velocity gradient tensor and hessian matrix of gravitational potential in section 4.2 . after discussing the eigenvalue threshold ,",
    "we finally conclude in section 5 .",
    "we are interested in one particular category of cosmic web classification algorithm that considers the movement of a test particle in the anisotropic gravitational field . in an appropriate frame , this could either be described by the hessian matrix of gravitational potential or the velocity gradient tensor . while the first characterizes the acceleration of the particle caused by the gravity , the latter describes the velocity changes . both of them relate to the trajectories of the particle around given point by the time integral . given the matrices , rotational invariants provide a more convenient parameter space for studying the sign of eigenvalues . for nonzero thresholds , however , the transformation of the invariants would be necessary , or equivalently the boundary condition among various morphologies need to be modified . to compare with other geometrical classification approaches",
    ", it is also valuable to examine the deformation tensor and derived scalars , e.g. the ellipticity and prolaticity .",
    "these scalars , usually well - defined in the linear region , require appropriate revision in the nonlinear regime .",
    "as initiated by @xcite and followed by @xcite , the dynamical approach considers the linearized equation of motion of a test particle near given position @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the comoving free - falling coordinate , @xmath3 is some time variable , @xmath4 is the hessian matrix of peculiar gravitational potential @xmath5 , and the zeroth - order term @xmath6 disappears in this frame .",
    "therefore , the linear dynamics near location @xmath0 is fully characterized by tensor @xmath7 , or as it s real and symmetric , three eigenvalues of @xmath7",
    ". then various morphologies could be classified by counting the number of eigenvalues greater than some threshold value . as motivated by this method",
    ", @xcite proposed a similar classification scheme based on the kinematic movement of the particle , also known as v - web , which is equivalent to considering the particle trajectory near @xmath0 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 . unlike the potential hessian matrix @xmath7 , in principle @xmath10 could be rotational and therefore non - symmetric @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we will only concentrate on the symmetric part of @xmath10 , assuming @xmath11 .",
    "both kinematic and dynamical approaches try to identify various cosmic structure by examining the tentative movement of the test particle .",
    "intuitively , one would expect the deviation between these two approaches after entering into the nonlinear regime as the acceleration / deceleration of the particle towards a certain direction is not necessarily the same as the velocity . in figure .",
    "( [ fig : t_v_sim_snapshot ] ) , we compare these two algorithms in the numerical simulation . before performing the classification , both velocity and potential fields have been smoothed by a gaussian filter with the characteristic length @xmath12 . unlike other works , here we assume the zero eigenvalue threshold for both tensors so that the cosmic web structure highlighted here would not be ` optimized ' visually . from the figure ,",
    "it is clear that these two methods produce very different classifications in details .",
    "actually , we select this snapshot in particular to underline how significant these two approaches could differ . however , as will be shown in section 4 , at least for filaments , the dissimilarity could be alleviated by restricting the trace of the tensor .          in practice ,",
    "both approaches concern the number of eigenvalues of the tensor above a certain threshold @xmath13 .",
    "as proposed by @xcite , assuming @xmath14 , this problem could also be reformulated as considering the number of positive / negative solutions of characteristic equation @xmath15 = 0 $ ] of tensor @xmath16 , i.e. @xmath17 where we assume @xmath18 for kinematic method and @xmath19 for dynamical approach .",

    ", we have already expressed them in terms of real eigenvalues @xmath24 . in the following",
    ", we will denote @xmath25 as invariants constructed from @xmath10 and @xmath26 as from @xmath19 .",
    "then the conditions of having certain number of positive / negative eigenvalues , is mapped into various regions in the invariants space . in figure .",
    "( [ fig : inv_space_th ] ) , we briefly illustrate these classifications in thick solid lines for both negative ( _ left panel _ ) and positive @xmath27 ( _ right panel _ ) . in both cases , the triangular - like region with real eigenvalues",
    "is enclosed by the solution of equation @xcite @xmath28 with the assumptions @xmath29 . within this region ,",
    "different morphologies are basically determined by the sign of invariants . for @xmath30 , region with @xmath31 and @xmath32",
    "denotes the void , while condition @xmath33 corresponds to the filament , and @xmath34 is cosmic sheet .",
    "similarly for @xmath35 , condition @xmath36 defines the cluster , @xmath37 corresponds to the sheet , and @xmath32 denotes the filament .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noticing that the classification would remain the same if the invariants are rescaled as @xmath38 by any positive constant @xmath39 , since the normalization of @xmath22 with @xmath39 would not change the sign of its eigenvalues .",
    "please see @xcite for more details of the invariants - based cosmic web classification .    for a nonzero eigenvalue threshold @xmath13 ,",
    "however , one could define the eigenvalue @xmath40 , and rewrite the characteristic equation ( [ eqn : chareq ] ) as function of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and then discuss the sign of variable @xmath41 .",
    "expanding equation ( [ eqn : chareq_th ] ) , it is equivalent to define a new set of invariants @xmath43 as @xcite , @xmath44 then all classification conditions of the invariants remain the same .",
    "alternatively , with the help of equation ( [ eqn : s_redfine_th ] ) , one could also express all conditions back into the original invariants space .",
    "since any linear combination of real eigenvalues with a real threshold @xmath13 remains real , the boundary condition separating real and complex solutions does not need to vary in the transformed three - dimensional invariant space @xmath45 .",
    "however , for illustrative purpose , we are also interested in the two - dimensional @xmath46 subspace as displayed in figure ( [ fig : inv_space_th ] ) , where the real - image separation surface would project onto @xmath47 plane differently .",
    "but if the sign of @xmath48 remains the same , one could simply rescale the invariants so that @xmath48 is unchanged ( e.g. @xmath49 ) , and the same for the boundary in the @xmath46 plane .",
    "then various morphologies within this region would be classified based on the sign of @xmath50 and its intersection with one of the solution in equation ( [ eqn : solution_s1 ] ) .    in figure ( [ fig : inv_space_th ] )",
    ", we also illustrate the effect of varying the threshold @xmath13 in the same two - dimensional invariants subspace , assuming @xmath48 does not change the sign .",
    "the thin solid lines correspond to the transformed equation @xmath51 , and various morphological regions with different @xmath13 are then enclosed by these lines and thick solid boundaries .",
    "for example , void or cluster are still those triangular regions , but with the original vertical condition @xmath52 changing accordingly . in each panel",
    ", we also set the transparency level to each threshold value for different colored ( morphological ) regions consistently .",
    "as could be seen , a negative @xmath13 will enlarge the region classified as void , and shrink the region of cluster and oppositely for positive @xmath13 . for sheet and filament ,",
    "however , they will be affected a little more complicated .",
    "as sheets with positive @xmath27 become more abundant with negative @xmath13 , regions tagged as sheet with negative @xmath27 at @xmath14 might become voids , and some filamentary regions will then be identified as sheet . meanwhile",
    ", filamentary regions with @xmath30 will be reduced , and some filaments with @xmath35 at @xmath14 will be classified as sheets . on the other hand , a few cluster regions will turn to this type ; and positive threshold would behave oppositely .",
    "besides the classification based on @xmath7 and @xmath10 , it will also be helpful to examine the deformation tensor as well , as it characterizes the geometric deformation of a fluid element during the evolution .",
    "the tensor is defined as @xmath53 here the displacement vector @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the eulerian position and @xmath56 is initial lagrangian coordinate .",
    "@xmath57 is the jacobian matrix between @xmath56 and @xmath55 , and @xmath58 is the identity matrix . unlike classification algorithms introduced previously , tensor @xmath59 characterizes the changes in shape and size of the fluid element .",
    "hence , it would be convenient to define the geometric quantities like the ellipticity and prolaticity from @xmath59 . for zeldovich approximation , where all eigenvalues of @xmath59 grow linearly , they are defined as @xcite @xmath60 assuming @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are eigenvalues of deformation tensor @xmath59 .",
    "however , for nonlinear evolution , it is possible that the denominator @xmath63 changes the sign during the cosmic evolution .",
    ", where @xmath64 is nonlinear , it is possible that an underdense perturbation @xmath65 would eventually collapse @xcite . ] therefore , @xmath66 and @xmath67 could be singular even before the shell - crossing .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we recover the full definition of the nonlinear ellipticity and prolaticity by substituting the denominator with its nonlinear counterpart @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the determinant of the jacobian @xmath71 . for @xmath72 ,",
    "these two equations are equivalent , and @xmath73 would keep the sign before the shell - crossing .",
    "one notices that the boundary condition @xmath74 and @xmath75 are still valid . in the following , we will omit superscripts and simply denote @xmath76 and @xmath77 as defined in equation ( [ eqn : ep_j ] ) .",

    "while the trace @xmath83 simply relates to the density via poisson equation , however , no time evolution equation exists for the @xmath85 in the newtonian cosmology .",

    "this could also be seen from the third equation of ( [ eqn : bj94_dynamics_params ] ) , given that @xmath193 approaches unity during the collapse .    in the invariants space",
    ", the collapsing filaments mainly correspond to region with @xmath194 with condition @xmath195 . from the definition of @xmath196 in equation ( [ eqn : phyvar_inv_v ] ) ,",
    "the first term @xmath197 is always positive , and the second one @xmath198 is negative . for filamentary regions with @xmath199 , the third term",
    "@xmath200 is obviously negative .",
    "however , even when @xmath131 becomes closer to @xmath201 , as long as the velocity shear @xmath202 grows at a similar speed to @xmath141 , the term @xmath198 would dwarf other contributions and therefore form filamentary configurations . meanwhile , as shown from the last two panels of figure ( [ fig : inv_traj_za_bj94_comp ] ) , one notices that the singularity occurs at @xmath203 . since @xmath204 , it implies that the velocity divergence @xmath141 indeed approaches the infinity at the same speed as velocity shear @xmath202 .    for underdense @xmath180",
    ", @xcite found that sufficient large tides and shear could cause the collapse of some initial expanding perturbations .",
    "moreover , from the invariants space of figure ( [ fig : inv_traj_za_bj94_comp ] ) , we could see a similar morphological instability towards voids or filaments , depending on the balance between the initial shear @xmath202 and divergence @xmath141 .",
    "since the boundary separating sheets with others is simply @xmath205 , it manifests itself as a universal decay of @xmath196 across the entire two - dimensional parameter space . for better understanding ,",
    "we first write down the rescaled invariant as @xmath206 where @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "our numerical calculation indicates that this ubiquitous decay of @xmath196 actually originates from various contributions very differently .",
    "although @xmath202 and @xmath141 all grow as @xmath209 at the linear order , the nonlinear evolution of both @xmath210 and @xmath211 then depends on the initial values . for the most part of the parameter space , the term in the parentheses would decay while @xmath210 grows",
    ". however , the opposite could also happen for very small ratio of @xmath212 .",
    "furthermore , the ultimate morphology of this instability after @xmath213 would depend primarily on the value of @xmath214 , and slightly on @xmath196 .",
    "given the parametrization of @xmath215 = ( \\theta i_{ij } + 2\\sigma q_{ij}(\\alpha ) ) /3 $ ] , when @xmath216 , even the smallest eigenvalue becomes positive regardless of the value of @xmath131 , so the fluid element would evolve to voids . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath217 , the smallest and the medium eigenvalues become negative but not the largest since we assume @xmath218 and @xmath219 , then it will become filament .          the disagreement between the kinematic and dynamical classification algorithms displayed in figure .",
    "( [ fig : t_v_sim_snapshot ] ) highlights the deviation between the nonlinear velocity gradient @xmath10 and potential hessian matrix @xmath7 .",
    "intuitively , one could argue that the anisotropic gravitational forces would affect the trajectory of a test particle further in time than the velocity gradient , and therefore might be a less faithful representation of the current cosmic web .",
    "quantitatively , this could be addressed by a direct comparison of the nonlinear evolution of these two tensors in , e.g. the nonlinear local model . before proceeding",
    ", we would first like to examine figure .",
    "( [ fig : t_v_sim_snapshot ] ) in more details . to improve the visual impression of dynamical classification algorithm",
    ", @xcite suggested to apply a nonzero @xmath13 of an order of unity based on the argument of spherical collapse model .",
    "as illustrated in figure ( [ fig : inv_space_th ] ) , a negative threshold , of the tensor @xmath19 in our convention , would indeed shrink the filamentary region , which appears to be responsible for the distorted cosmic web structure , and meanwhile increase sheets and decrease clusters .    on the other hand ,",
    "since the dynamical trajectories differ significantly for positive and negative @xmath220 in the invariant space , it is convenient to further divide both filament and sheet morphologies based on the sign of @xmath220 . in figure ( [ fig : t_v_sim_snapshot_detailed ] ) , we perform this detailed comparison for the same simulation snapshot as in figure ( [ fig : t_v_sim_snapshot ] ) .",
    "interestingly , given almost completely different structures in figure ( [ fig : t_v_sim_snapshot ] ) , filaments with positive @xmath220 , shown in the first column of the figure , exhibit a very similar pattern for both tensors .",
    "moreover , the major contribution to the dissimilarity come from the filaments with negative @xmath220 , as shown in the second column , where much more regions are classified as this type for tensor @xmath7 than @xmath10 .    assuming the nonlinear local model , we then plot in figure .",
    "( [ fig : inv_traj_bj94 ] ) the dynamical evolution of invariants for tensors @xmath10 and @xmath19 together , who are indeed comparable as we have already rescaled the invariants so that @xmath221 = { \\rm tr}[-\\phi_{ij } ] = \\pm 1 $ ] . for underdense perturbation @xmath180",
    ", one sees that morphologies from both tensors exhibit similar sheet instability , as all trajectories evolve towards the voids or filaments .",
    "meanwhile , it is obvious that trajectories in @xmath26 space squeeze towards the boundary separating real and complex solutions . by definition",
    ", this suggests at least two of eigenvalues should be closer to each other than that of tensor @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath7 is simply proportional to @xmath10 initially , an immediate consequence is the enrichment of potential classified filaments with negative density perturbation @xmath64 , which is exactly what has been observed in the simulation .",
    "physically , at least two factors are responsible for such behavior , as suggested by the nonlinear local model .",
    "the first is that the angle @xmath132 approaches @xmath222 from the value of @xmath201 faster than @xmath131 , and therefore it would produce more filamentary structures . on the other hand , since the evolution equation of the tidal tensor ( equation [ eqn : epsij_evl_bj94 ] ) is sourced by both density @xmath223 ( instead of density perturbation @xmath64 ) and the shear tensor @xmath189 , @xmath85 grows as @xmath224 compared with @xmath202 for shear tensor ( equation [ eqn : aij_phi_parametrization ] ) .",
    "consequently , the rescaled tidal tensor @xmath225 would grow slower than the rescaled shear tensor @xmath226 for underdense perturbation @xmath227 , for in general @xmath228",
    ". therefore , the differences between eigenvalues @xmath229 are usually narrower for tensor @xmath7 than @xmath10 . from the definition of @xmath230 in equation ( [ eqn : phyvar_inv_v ] ) and ( [ eqn : phyvar_inv_phi ] ) , this corresponds to a slower motion of invariant @xmath231 than @xmath214 , as shown in figure ( [ fig : inv_traj_bj94 ] ) .    for overdense perturbation @xmath182",
    ", @xmath145 also evolves very differently than @xmath232 . unlike velocity invariants , where the first singularity occurs at @xmath233 , both @xmath234 and @xmath235 approach infinity as @xmath236 , which again is due to the source term of the evolution equation of tidal field @xmath85 .",
    "however , this does not necessarily suggest the kinematic and dynamical morphologies differ in this regime . for vanishing threshold @xmath14 , or even some reasonable nonzero values",
    ", clusters and sheets identified with both tensors will turn to filaments very soon so that no significant differences would emerge .",
    "this could also be seen with the help of the evolution of deformation tensor . in figure .",
    "( [ fig : comp_dft_lth0 ] ) , we plot the evolution of ellipticity @xmath76 and prolaticity @xmath77 , colored by the kinematic morphologies in upper panels and dynamical categories in the lower ones .",
    "morphological changes are characterized by segmented color arrows , with the discontinuity point reflecting the epoch of the morphology transition .",
    "the trajectories are calculated via equation ( [ eqn : deform_de ] ) with @xmath10 supplemented by the nonlinear local model . as expected",
    ", the overdense perturbations , shown in the third column , would evolve from various initial values towards much higher @xmath76 and @xmath77 as they become filaments .",
    "moreover , both velocity and potential classifications display very similar morphology categorizations .    for the underdense region ,",
    "we show both @xmath237 and @xmath238 in the first two columns .",
    "consistent with the bifurcate evolution in the invariant space , trajectories with various initial ellipticity and prolaticity flow towards the opposite directions in @xmath239 plane .",
    "one is the spherical void region with @xmath240 and @xmath241 , and the other is the non - spherical prolate filament region with @xmath242 , while the non - spherical sheets reside in between .",
    "since both upper and lower panels display the same geometrical evolution of a fluid element , the color scheme shows that gravitational potential - based algorithm in general would identify more filaments and fewer sheets than kinematical classification .",
    "practically , a nonzero threshold is usually applied in the algorithm to ` optimize ' the visual impression of the cosmic web . as already shown in figure ( [ fig : inv_space_th ] ) , a negative @xmath13 would indeed help to reduce the otherwise excessive filaments and sheets , meanwhile increase the volume fraction of void regions .",
    "however , geometric deformation of a fluid element is well defined by quantities like ellipticity and prolaticity . in figure .",
    "( [ fig : inv_dft_th ] ) , we highlight the morphologies variations in both velocity invariant space and the deformation @xmath239 plane .",
    "since all trajectories in the upper panels are normalized by @xmath243 , where @xmath244 , this corresponds to a time - dependent threshold @xmath245 with constant @xmath246 and @xmath247 respectively . therefore , the morphology of a fluid element with given shape measurement depends on the threshold @xmath13 , which reflects the ambiguous definition of the cosmic web .",
    "this then leads to the question about the purpose of the morphological classification and its associated ` best ' algorithm .",
    "an outstanding visual impression would require both density threshold and anisotropic information , like @xmath10 or @xmath7 , at various scales .",
    "for many studies , e.g. the environmental dependence of halo formation , it is probably more important to describe quantitatively the entanglement of relevant quantities than satisfying the preference of the human brain . in this sense ,",
    "the ` morphology classification ' is only a simplification to the more complicated problem . without any arbitrary tuning of the threshold , the tensor @xmath10 and @xmath7 themselves and corresponding rotational invariants are attractive quantities as they characterize the underlying physical processes .",
    "therefore , besides developing various classification algorithms , more efforts should be made to understand the detailed evolution of these quantities .",
    "in this paper , we revisited the lagrangian evolution of various tensors , including the velocity gradient tensor @xmath10 , the hessian matrix of gravitational potential @xmath7 and the deformation tensor @xmath59 , for their useful applications in the cosmic web classification .",
    "unlike previous studies , we performed the investigation in the invariant space , defined as coefficients of the characteristic equation of @xmath10 and @xmath7 . compared with the eigenvalue representation ,",
    "this parameter space is much more convenient in tracking the dynamical evolution of these tensors .",
    "we then presented the solution for both zeldovich approximation and the nonlinear local model .",
    "although the latter model is neither newtonian nor fully general relativistic , it is reasonable to assume to be a suitable approximation for our purpose .",
    "since one could easily write down the analytical solution of invariants evolution in za , we reconfirm the fact that cosmic morphologies would not change before approaching a one - dimensional singularity in this model . however , the nonlinear local model would in general lead to the morphology instability and changes . for overdense perturbation , the sheet configurations usually collapse to filaments very quickly due to the coupling between tidal tensor @xmath85 and velocity shear @xmath189 . for underdense regions ,",
    "however , the sheet could either evolve to void or filament depending on the balance between the shear @xmath202 and divergence @xmath141 for @xmath10 , or the tides @xmath155 and density @xmath64 for @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly , our comparison of the invariants trajectories between tensor @xmath10 and @xmath7 suggests that different evolving speed of the instability is responsible for some distinctions of the cosmic web classified using these two tensors .",
    "since both tensors start from the same morphologies initially , the squeezed trajectories of @xmath7 in figure ( [ fig : inv_traj_bj94 ] ) suggests more abundant filaments with negative @xmath248 , which is exactly what has been observed in the simulation .",
    "physically , this is caused by both different evolving speed of tensor angle @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and the source term of the tidal field evolution equation ( [ eqn : epsij_evl_bj94 ] ) .    however , there re some limitations of our approach as well .",
    "first of all , the dynamics only work before the singularity , therefore very little conclusion would be able to make for overdense regions . fortunately , for our purpose , it is equally , if not more , important to study the underdense perturbations . secondly , since it s still possible that this nonlinear local model would not fully capture the real dynamics , one need to be cautious about the direct comparison between simulation and the model calculation .",
    "for example , from figure ( [ fig : inv_traj_bj94 ] ) , one might also expect to observe more potential classified voids than the other algorithm .",
    "however , the simulation measurement produces somewhat similar fractions of voids for these two methods .",
    "in addition , if one tries to measure the eigenvalue differences @xmath249 from the simulation , the inequality @xmath250 would only hold for the differences between the largest eigenvalue and the other two . for the difference between the smallest two eigenvalues ,",
    "however , both tensors have similar distributions , with only slightly asymmetry favoring equation ( [ eqn : deltav_l_deltap ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", theoretical calculation shows its validity for all three @xmath229s . nevertheless , whether or not this suggests",
    "the failure of the model is not clear .",
