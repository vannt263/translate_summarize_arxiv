    "the field of communication complexity , originated by yao s 1979 seminal work @xcite , aims to study the minimum amount of communication needed for multiple distributed parties to accomplish a given communication task .",
    "such tasks are typically formalized as follows : players are given private inputs and asked to solve some computational problems based on them .",
    "to do this , some communication will have to take place in the form of exchanging messages .",
    "while such models were originally considered in the context of classical protocols , it has since been realized that quantum resources , e.g. , quantum communication channels ( players are allowed to exchange quantum states instead of classical messages ) , may offer significant advantage .",
    "for example , there exist tasks for which quantum strategies can consume exponentially less communication than any classical one , even without shared entanglement @xcite .",
    "these results sparked interest in further characterizing which tasks exhibit distinctions between quantum and classical communication protocols , and what kind of distinctions there can be .",
    "the vast majority of previous work in this field was carried out in the constant bounded - error setting . here",
    "we shall focus on a scenario where the allowed probability of error is zero or vanishingly small .",
    "recently , a peculiar type of one - way communication task between two players alice and bob , namely the exclusion game , was introduced by perry , jain , and oppenheim ( pjo ) @xcite : alice randomly draws an @xmath0-bit string @xmath1 , and bob randomly draws some subset @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 , both from uniform distributions .",
    "alice then sends a single message regarding her input to bob .",
    "they win the game if bob outputs a string @xmath4 that is different from @xmath1 restricted to the bits specified by @xmath5 .",
    "a particular exclusion game can be denoted by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the allowed probability of error . comparing to the conventional bounded - error tasks of computing functions , exclusion games exhibit some special properties .",
    "they are relational tasks : multiple outputs can be accepted for one certain input ; and they are extremely sensitive to error : if @xmath8 , then no communication is required as bob can succeed at his task by guessing a string at random . in ref .",
    "@xcite , pjo demonstrated a new kind of quantum - classical separation : they devised a zero - error quantum strategy that only reveals vanishingly small amount of information regarding alice s input for the exclusion games with large @xmath9 , while any zero - error classical strategy must reveal almost everything .",
    "more formally , there is an infinite gap between the quantum and classical information complexities ( the minimum amount of information regarding alice s private input that needs to be revealed ) of these exclusion games .    in this paper",
    ", we further analyze the complexities of different exclusion games , and exhibit several features .",
    "the pjo strategy requires that exactly @xmath0 qubits be sent from alice to bob , i.e. , the communication cost is @xmath0 .",
    "since the amount of information actually revealed is vanishingly small , an interesting question that naturally arises is as to how much we can possibly reduce the communication cost . for zero - error exclusion games with @xmath9 scaling strongly sublinearly in @xmath0 ,",
    "we show that any winning quantum strategy can be classically simulated with at most exponential overhead . combining with the linear lower bound on the classical communication complexity",
    ", we establish a logarithmic lower bound on the quantum communication complexity of these games . as a result",
    ", there is an at least subconstant versus logarithmic gap between the quantum information and communication complexities of the exclusion games for which both sides hold simultaneously ( they exist ) .",
    "that is , a vanishingly small amount of extractable information must be carried by a diverging amount of communication for these tasks .",
    "this gap is an example of doubly infinite gaps , which we shall motivate and define later .",
    "next , we extend our analysis to the cases where error may be allowed ( @xmath10 ) . by slightly different arguments ,",
    "we show that the overhead of classically simulating a quantum strategy is still at most exponential for small @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath11 , we show that the classical communication complexity is still at least linear , thus the logarithmic lower bound on the quantum communication complexity and the doubly infinite gap between the quantum information and communication complexities of certain exclusion games hold .",
    "the significance of the doubly infinite gap between quantum information and communication complexities may be compared with its classical counterpart . for constant non - zero probability of error ,",
    "the gap between classical information and communication complexities is at most exponential for any communication task @xcite . for zero and asymptotically vanishing probability of error ,",
    "the largest known gap is constant versus superconstant ( `` singly infinite '' ) and occurs for the equality function @xcite .",
    "our results may lead to a better understanding of the relation between information and communication complexities , which is a major objective of recent research in the field of communication complexity ( in both classical and quantum settings ) .",
    "we should mention that with regards to the gaps between quantum and classical communication complexities , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that for computing functions in the bounded - error model ( without shared entanglement or randomness ) , they can be at most exponential . as the exclusion game is a relational problem and",
    "the interesting separations occur only when the probability or error is zero or tends to zero asymptotically , the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite can not be directly applied here .",
    "our results indicate that the conclusion holds for almost all exclusion games .",
    "however , it indeed remains open as to whether the gap can be superexponential for those games with @xmath9 scaling linearly in @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we show that @xmath12 allows the @xmath0-qubit quantum communication of the pjo strategy to be compressed at least polynomially .",
    "most of our results are summarized in fig .",

    "two types of information - theoretic quantities associated with a certain communication task are of great interest and importance in our context , namely , the communication @xcite and information @xcite complexities . here",
    ", we formally define them .",
    "the communication cost of a @xmath18 protocol @xmath19 [ where @xmath20 ( classical ) or @xmath21 ( quantum ) in our context ] , denoted by @xmath22 , is defined to be the maximum number of bits or qubits that are exchanged in any run of the protocol , where the maximum is taken over all inputs and the value of any randomness used .",
    "the information cost of a @xmath18 protocol @xmath19 , denoted by @xmath23 , aims to measure the amount of information regarding the players inputs revealed by @xmath19 . here",
    ", we consider one - way protocols , i.e. , the communication is only from alice to bob .",
    "suppose that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , alice and bob s inputs , distributed according to a joint distribution @xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath27 , where @xmath19 on the right - hand side essentially denotes the message exchanged during the protocol together with the public randomness used , and @xmath28 measures the mutual information between @xmath29 and @xmath30 given knowledge of @xmath31 @xcite . the distribution - independent information cost is then defined to be @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "complexities measure the minimum possible amount of certain costs that need to take place to accomplish the task , where the minimization is taken over all winning protocols .",
    "the @xmath18 communication complexity of a task @xmath33 is then defined to be @xmath34 , where @xmath35 are all winning @xmath18 protocols for @xmath33 .",
    "the distribution - dependent and distribution - independent @xmath18 information complexities of one - way tasks are defined similarly .",
    "we emphasize that these quantities of interest are only associated with the communication between players .",
    "players themselves can have unlimited access to any kind of local resources .",
    "we are interested in the limiting behaviors of complexities as the size of the task @xmath0 tends to infinity . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the standard notation to describe asymptotic complexities .",
    "in addition to the widely used @xmath36 ( bachmann - landau ) symbols ( formal definitions can be found in , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the following soft symbols are also used when needed .",
    "for example , @xmath37 ( soft-@xmath38 ) means @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 for some @xmath41 , while @xmath42 ( soft-@xmath43 ) means @xmath44 , i.e. , @xmath45 for any @xmath41 . soft-@xmath46 and soft-@xmath47 are defined analogously .",
    "now , we introduce the notion of infinite asymptotic gaps and discuss different types of such gaps in an intuitive manner .",
    "formal definitions are left to appendix [ app : gap ] .",
    "the gap between two asymptotic complexities is normally characterized by a type of increasing monotone function .",
    "for example , there is a quadratic gap between @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and an exponential gap between @xmath50 and @xmath49 .",
    "however , when one side is @xmath51 , i.e. , superconstant ( or @xmath52 , i.e. , subconstant ) , while the other side is not , the gap between them grows faster than any such monotone function .",
    "we regard such gaps as infinite .",
    "in fact , all ( positive ) asymptotic complexities belong to one of the following three classes : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , or @xmath51 . in the logarithmic scale",
    ", these three types of asymptotic complexities tend to negative infinity , constant , and positive infinity , respectively .",
    "the gap between any two of them is infinite . in particular ,",
    "an @xmath52 vs.  @xmath51 gap can be regarded as doubly infinite , whereas an @xmath52 vs.  @xmath53 or @xmath53 vs.  @xmath51 gap is only singly infinite . evidently , the gap between any two asymptotic complexities can not be larger than doubly infinite .",
    "the general behaviors and comparisons of infinite gaps are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ infgap ] .    '' means singly infinite ; `` @xmath17 '' means doubly infinite . ]",
    "a communication task between two players is typically defined by a function @xmath54 ( @xmath55 denotes the set of bit strings with arbitrary length ) : alice and bob are respectively given some string @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "they are allowed to exchange messages , and one of them outputs a string @xmath58 in the end .",
    "they succeed at the task if @xmath59 . to formally define the exclusion game ,",
    "a more general framework of communication tasks is needed . the problem is now defined by a relation @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , we restrict the protocol to be one - way : alice can send one message to bob , and bob outputs an answer .",
    "they succeed at the task if @xmath61 .",
    "it is evident that the general framework reduces to the original one if for all @xmath62 , there exists a unique @xmath58 for which @xmath61 .",
    "generically , relational tasks are those admitting multiple winning outputs for one certain input .",
    "the exclusion game is a relational task defined by the relation @xmath63 : alice s input @xmath64 and bob s input @xmath2 , |y|=m$ ] ( @xmath5 can be encoded as a string to conform to the above general framework ) are both drawn randomly from uniform distributions , and @xmath65 denotes the string given by @xmath1 restricted to the bits specified by @xmath5 .",
    "the winning condition is that bob s output @xmath66 , for given @xmath1 and @xmath5 .",
    "pjo devised the following quantum strategy @xcite that wins every exclusion game with certainty , i.e. , works for any @xmath6 .",
    "given the input @xmath67 , alice encodes each classical bit @xmath68 as the qubit @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "the @xmath0-bit string @xmath71 is then encoded as the joint state @xmath72 which she sends to bob via the quantum channel . upon receiving the state from alice",
    ", bob performs a global measurement across the @xmath9 systems specified by @xmath5 ( denoted by @xmath73 ) .",
    "the measurement is given by @xmath74 as one can verify , @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "that is , bob always outputs some @xmath76 according to the measurement outcome .",
    "therefore , they win the game with certainty .",
    "this measurement technique may be described as a conclusive - exclusion measurement .",
    "it was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was subsequently used to prove the pusey - barrett - rudolph ( pbr ) theorem @xcite , a result in the field of quantum foundations that rules out a certain class of @xmath77-epistemic models of quantum mechanics .    the pjo strategy exhibits a striking property : the amount of information alice actually reveals to bob ( the information cost ) tends to zero as @xmath0 increases , in a certain regime .",
    "more specifically , it can be calculated that @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the von neumann entropy of the quantum message @xmath80 ( the ensemble of @xmath81 where @xmath1 is an @xmath0-bit string with each of the @xmath82 possibilities being equally likely ) that alice sends to bob . when @xmath13 , @xmath83 .",
    "this directly indicates that @xmath84 in the specified regime .",

    "here , we prove an @xmath85 lower bound on @xmath86 , when @xmath87 . that is , there can not exist any winning quantum strategy whose communication cost scales sublogarithmically in @xmath0 in this regime .",
    "the main idea of the proof is to approximately simulate any quantum protocol for @xmath88 by a classical protocol with exponential overhead , and show that the task can still be accomplished with zero probability of error . because of the tiny possible probability of error associated with the exclusion game , the existence of such a simulation is non - obvious and the results of ref .",
    "@xcite can not be applied , but we show that it can be made to work when @xmath89 . then , lower bounds on the classical communication complexities in this regime would directly imply exponentially smaller lower bounds on the corresponding quantum communication complexities .",
    "the following lemma sets a linear lower bound on the classical communication complexities of almost all exclusion games :    [ classical_lower_bound ] for @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a constant , @xmath92 .",
    "the proof of this lemma is given in appendix [ app : lemmas ] .",
    "note that the applicable regime of this lemma covers @xmath87 .",
    "this enables us to prove the following result :    [ main ] for @xmath87 , @xmath93 .    here",
    ", we only sketch the main steps of the proof .",
    "details are given in appendix [ app : zero ] .",
    "suppose that for @xmath88 with @xmath87 , there exists a winning quantum strategy @xmath94 such that @xmath95 .",
    "then based on @xmath94 , we can devise a corresponding classical strategy @xmath96 such that @xmath97 as follows . given input @xmath1 , the quantum message that alice sends to bob in @xmath94",
    "can be encoded as a @xmath98-qubit pure state @xmath99 .",
    "first , alice prepares a classical message @xmath100 that approximately encodes @xmath101 , by registering the real ( @xmath102 ) and imaginary parts ( @xmath103 ) of all amplitudes ( @xmath104 ) to accuracy @xmath105 ( the approximations are denoted by @xmath106 and @xmath107 ) .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath108 , when @xmath87 .",
    "alice then sends @xmath100 to bob , whose local strategy can be considered as a positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath109 with @xmath110 elements , each indicating an @xmath9-bit output string @xmath111 .",
    "bob first normalizes the amplitude vector encoded in @xmath100 , and then applies born s rule to compute the approximate probability @xmath112 of obtaining each @xmath111 . given the above accuracy of encoding",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , bob simply outputs a @xmath111 such that @xmath114 , which always exists .",
    "since @xmath97 , we have reached a contradiction to lemma [ classical_lower_bound ] .",
    "therefore , no quantum strategies @xmath94 such that @xmath115 for @xmath88 with @xmath87 can exist : @xmath93 in this regime .",
    "this result directly implies the following gaps between complexities :    [ gaps ] for @xmath88 with @xmath13 and @xmath87 , we have @xmath116 ( tends to zero as @xmath0 increases ) , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "thus the gap between    * @xmath119 and @xmath120 : doubly infinite ; * @xmath120 and @xmath121 : at most exponential .",
    "in the discussions above , bob is required to output a right answer every single time . if error is allowed sometimes , do the properties of the zero - error instances still hold ?",
    "note that @xmath122 is trivial since such probability of error can be achieved by randomly guessing without any communication . with a variant of the zero - error simulation protocol , we show the following general result for @xmath123 :    [ error ] consider some @xmath124 such that @xmath7 satisfies @xmath125 .",
    "suppose that for @xmath6 with @xmath123 , there exists a winning quantum strategy @xmath126 such that @xmath127 .",

    "details are given in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "we revise bob s local part of @xmath96 presented in theorem [ main ] to devise @xmath128 as follows . as for the zero - error case , given input @xmath1",
    ", alice prepares an @xmath1302^{o(\\xi(n))}$]-bit classical message that encodes the real and imaginary parts of all amplitudes of the quantum message @xmath131 in @xmath126 to accuracy @xmath132 , and sends it to bob , who then normalizes the amplitude vector . instead of classically calculating the probability distribution of the output as in @xmath96 ,",
    "bob now resorts to local quantum resources .",
    "he simply prepares a new quantum state @xmath133 according to the amplitudes , and then feeds it into his original local quantum computation .",
    "it can be shown that the probability of outputting the wrong answer @xmath134 is always less than @xmath135 , which guarantees that @xmath136 is not the winning output .",
    "therefore , bob can run @xmath128 multiple times and take majority vote to suppress the probability of error to an arbitrarily small value by the chernoff bound ( amplitude amplification ) .",
    "when @xmath137 , it was shown in an early version of ref .",
    "@xcite that only one classical bit of communication is needed . for completeness",
    "we include the proof in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "therefore we consider only the regime of even smaller @xmath7 to be of interest .",
    "since @xmath138 under this constraint , @xmath124 can be replaced by @xmath9 in the above discussions .",
    "like the zero - error case , for @xmath87 , this theorem indicates that the gap between @xmath120 and @xmath121 for @xmath6 , when any non - trivial @xmath7 is allowed , is at most exponential .",
    "consequently , the logarithmic lower bound on @xmath120 and the gaps established for the zero - error case still hold even if some @xmath7 such that @xmath139 is allowed . the permissible range of @xmath7 is identified by the following theorem :    [ cerror ] for @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a constant and @xmath140 , @xmath141 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ cerror ] is given in appendix [ app : cerror ] . combining theorems [ error ] and [ cerror ] , we obtain the following results :    [ gaperror ] for @xmath87 and @xmath140 , @xmath142 . by further restricting @xmath13",
    ", the gaps established in corollary [ gaps ] still hold .",
    "although the pjo strategy succeeds with vanishingly small amount of information cost , it requires exactly @xmath0 qubits of communication , which is maximal . for @xmath87 ,",
    "the possibility of superexponential compression of quantum communication cost has been ruled out , but it remains unsettled if any compression is possible at all .",
    "in particular , one may wonder if quantum strategies can be more efficient than classical ones in communication cost . here , we show that a polynomial reduction of quantum communication cost can be achieved by abandoning an insignificant part of the pjo message , while only causing a tiny probability of error such that @xmath139 still holds :    [ compression ] for @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 .    here",
    ", we only sketch the main steps of the proof .",
    "details are given in appendix [ appd ] .",
    "instead of directly sending the @xmath0-qubit state given by eq .",
    ", alice now compresses the message by projecting it onto the subspace spanned by the computational basis vectors with hamming weight ( the number of ones ) at most @xmath41 . upon receiving the message",
    ", bob performs the same measurement on the quantum state as in the original pjo strategy .",
    "obviously , this would lead to some probability of error @xmath148 .",
    "however , it can be shown that taking @xmath149 with any @xmath150 is sufficient to guarantee that @xmath151 .",
    "it then follows that the size of the compressed message scales as @xmath152 for any @xmath147 .",
    "combining theorems [ cerror ] and [ compression ] , we obtain another quantum - classical separation :    for @xmath6 with @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , there is a polynomial gap between @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "in this paper , we obtained some new knowledge about quantum communication by studying different regimes of the exclusion game .",
    "the key result of this paper is a logarithmic lower bound on the quantum communication complexity of most exclusion games .",
    "this bound indicates the following results : ( i ) a doubly infinite gap between the quantum information and communication complexities ; ( ii ) the gap between the quantum and classical communication complexities of certain relational tasks with exponentially small possible probability of error is at most exponential .",
    "in contrast , the largest known gap between classical information and communication complexities is singly infinite @xcite , and the known upper bound of quantum - classical gap in communication complexities only applies to bounded - error function problems @xcite . for exclusion games , we leave open the problems of whether the @xmath85 lower bound on the quantum communication complexity for @xmath14 is tight , and whether the gap between the quantum and classical communication complexities for @xmath156 can be superexponential .",
    "( interestingly , for a slight modification of the exclusion game , there exists a singly infinite gap between the entanglement - assisted communication complexity and the ordinary classical communication complexity @xcite . )",
    "another set of important open problems is related to how large the gap between quantum information and communication complexities can be in different settings , e.g. , bounded - error , entanglement - assisted , interactive . answers to these problems will provide significant insight into the relation between these complexities , and the power of quantum resources in the communication model .",

    "in @xmath94 , bob s local strategy can always be modeled as a quantum circuit with @xmath99 being the input , i.e. , quantum operations followed by a generalized measurement by the principle of deferred measurement @xcite , which is altogether equivalent to some povm @xmath247 . although @xmath247 may contain an arbitrary number of elements in principle , there are only @xmath110 possible strings that bob can eventually output : @xmath248 , where @xmath4 is an @xmath9-bit string .",
    "therefore , all @xmath249 s corresponding to the same @xmath4 can be combined as an element @xmath250 of a new povm @xmath251 by @xmath252 or in the continuum limit where the elements are labeled by a continuous variable @xmath26 , @xmath253 due to the convexity of the set of all non - negative hermitian operators ( valid povm elements ) , @xmath251 forms a discrete effective povm with @xmath110 elements labeled by @xmath4 .",
    "a subtlety here is that the amplitude vector encoded in @xmath243 is not necessarily normalized .",
    "bob first normalizes the amplitude vector by dividing each component with the 2-norm @xmath254 , and then applies born s rule to compute the approximate probability of obtaining each @xmath4 : @xmath255 where @xmath256 is the @xmath257-th entry of @xmath258 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath94 never fails indicates that the probability of outputting the povm elements corresponding to a wrong answer is exactly zero .",
    "as indicated by lemma [ pert2 ] , the approximate distribution @xmath259 can be arbitrarily close to the true one ( denoted by @xmath260 ) when @xmath246 is sufficiently small , so the probability corresponding to the wrong answer @xmath261 calculated by eq .",

    "the probability of outputting the wrong answer satisfies : @xmath309 as long as @xmath310 is not the output with the largest probability , i.e. , @xmath311 bob can apply amplitude amplification to suppress the probability of error : he simply repeats his local protocol for @xmath172 times ( he can use the classical message to prepare as many copies of @xmath133 as he wants ) , and outputs the string @xmath4 that comes out for most times .",
