    "neutron stars have still larger chemical potential , and the behavior of such objects depends on the phase structure of qcd in cold , dense environments @xcite . at large chemical potential it is expected that mesons condense , beginning with the pions at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of qcd at high density has been explored via the chiral lagrangian @xcite , the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite , and lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the general consensus is that at low temperatures and vanishing baryon chemical potential there is a second order transition from the hadronic phase to a pion condensate phase at a critical isospin chemical potential @xmath0 around the pion mass @xmath2 mev , or larger at finite temperature .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite has provided motivation for extra - dimensional ( holographic ) models of qcd @xcite . both explicit and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking may be built into the extra - dimensional models , resulting in an effective description similar to extended hidden - local - symmetry models @xcite .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence maps sources and expectation values of field theory operators to backgrounds of extra - dimensional fields with corresponding quantum numbers . by studying fluctuations about a prescribed background ,",
    "the model makes predictions for field theory observables .",
    "we study the behavior of matter with isospin chemical potential in a holographic model of hadrons .",
    "related analyses in other holographic systems appear elsewhere ( _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "we are motivated to study the hard - wall model of refs .",
    "@xcite in light of recent suggestions that the pion condensate phase is absent in that model @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we identify the pion condensate phase and study its properties .",
    "the hard - wall models @xcite are the simplest holographic models which capture certain features of qcd .",
    "the hard - wall geometry is a region of 4 + 1 dimensional ( 5d ) anti - de sitter space preserving the isometries of 3 + 1 dimensional ( 4d ) minkowski space .",
    "the main motivation for this choice of spacetime is its simplicity , although arguments have been made to support the choice of anti - de sitter space in light of asymptotic freedom at high energies and evidence for an approximate conformal invariance in qcd at lower energies @xcite .",
    "the presence of a wall , which terminates the spacetime at what is referred to as the ir boundary , leads to a discrete spectrum of kaluza - klein modes identified via their quantum numbers with towers of hadronic resonances .",
    "global symmetries are lifted to gauge invariances in the holographic description . in order to include the approximate chiral symmetry of the up and down quarks , su(2)@xmath3su(2)@xmath4 gauge fields",
    "are included in the 5d model . to mimic the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking , a set of scalar fields transforming in the bifundamental representation of the chiral symmetry group",
    "is introduced .",
    "the quantum numbers of the scalar fields are those of the scalar quark bilinear @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are flavor indices which are now gauge indices .",
    "the scalar fields have a background profile which preserves the 4d lorentz invariance of the spacetime but breaks the chiral symmetry to the diagonal isospin subgroup",
    ".    the linearized equations of motion for the scalar field have two independent background solutions : a normalizable mode and a non - normalizable mode , the difference being that the normalizable mode has a finite effective 4d action , while the non - normalizable mode has a divergent action .",
    "if the non - normalizable mode is turned on , then the theory is modified so as to explicitly break the chiral symmetry , as if by a quark mass ; if the normalizable mode has a nonvanishing background then there is a spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , as if by a contribution to the chiral condensate @xmath8 .    the chemical potential for the third component of isospin acts as a source for the isospin number density @xmath9 which is the time component of the isospin current @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the generators of the isospin su(2 ) , and the subscript @xmath12 represents the vector subgroup of the chiral symmetry . a source for the time component of the current couples as would the time component of a background gauge field .",
    "hence , a non - normalizable background for the time component of the vector combination of 5d gauge fields mimics an isospin chemical potential in the 4d effective theory .    as the magnitude of the isospin chemical potential",
    "is increased above the pion mass , it becomes energetically favorable for a pion condensate to form .",
    "we find that the phase transition is first order in the hard - wall model unless the 5d gauge coupling vanishes .",
    "the speed of sound @xmath13 at high temperatures was conjectured to satisfy a `` sound bound '' @xmath14 @xcite , where @xmath15 is the conformal limit .",
    "fluctuations in the condensate at zero temperature violate the `` sound bound , '' except near the phase boundary and then only if the 5d gauge coupling is small enough .",
    "violation of the sound bound at low temperature is not unusual @xcite and has also been observed in certain d - brane systems @xcite and in a holographic model describing matter at a lifshitz point @xcite .    to describe systems at nonvanishing temperature ,",
    "extra - dimensional models are modified to include a black - hole horizon .",
    "however , we will focus on the zero - temperature phase of isospin matter , which corresponds to the original hard - wall background without a black - hole horizon . for simplicity we do not include chemical potentials except for isospin , so our analysis provides only a narrow cross section of the phase structure of the model",
    ". extensions of these results to nonvanishing temperature and baryon chemical potential , and to include strange quarks and kaon condensation @xcite , may shed light on the phases of matter in neutron stars and other extreme environments .",
    "the action for the 5d hard - wall model with chiral symmetry is given by @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] ( similarly for @xmath20 ) , and we normalize the gauge kinetic term as in @xcite .",

    "working in the gauge @xmath56 , the fields satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath57 .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath58 corresponds to the gauge - invariant condition @xmath59 , but this choice is not unique and is made for simplicity .    by eliminating @xmath60",
