    "this quantity , for a given value of @xmath75 , presents a maximum just at the crossover between the @xmath86 and @xmath152 phases , and then it smoothly decreases upon further increase of @xmath18 .",
    "however , this integral is much smaller than the kinetic energy ( notice the factor of 4 in fig .",

    "magnetic properties show the presence of an ascending  staircase \" of the total spin @xmath31 as the magnetic couplings @xmath140 increase for a fixed value of the hopping integral @xmath75 .",
    "these phases with @xmath152 have a ferrimagnetic origin and spin - spin correlations do not present the typical behavior of a ferromagnetic state but they correspond to an incommensurate phase which is described by a peak of the structure magnetic factor located at @xmath132 independently of the doping fraction .",
    "our results suggest that this ferrimagnetic phase will survive in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have also observed this staircase in @xmath31 in the fkl model , a result which was not reported to our knowledge in previous studies on this model.@xcite however , we can not exclude at this point the possibility of this result being a mere finite size effect . in this model , we have also observed that the magnetic peak moves from its ic value to its fm value in a step - like fashion as @xmath144 increases _ at a fixed density_.    the optical conductivity for the 1d model for vo@xmath1 shows a broad incoherent structure with indications of the presence of a pseudogap , and spectral weight that is transferred to higher frequencies as @xmath18 is increased for a given value of the hopping constant @xmath75 .",
    "this behavior is different from the one observed in isolated @xmath5 chains , and more relevant to the topic of ferromagnetic metals , it is also very different from the one observed in the 1d fkl model .",
    "this different behavior in @xmath146 is translated to the drude weight . in the fkl model",
    "there is a strong enhancement of the drude weight upon entering in the fm phase , while in the present model the drude weight essentially follows the behavior of the kinetic energy .    in summary , in the proposed model for vo@xmath1 , at least in its 1d version",
    ", there is not a true ferromagnetic order but rather an ic ferrimagnetic one , and contrary to what happens in the fkl model , electronic transport is somewhat suppressed by this ferrimagnetic order .",
    "more realistic variants of the model here studied would include a three - chain ladder or a two - dimensional lattice , a hubbard interaction instead of the t - j one , and a dimerization on the t - j chain . by increasing the dimensionality it could be possible to achieve a ratio between v@xmath3 , v@xmath4 and v@xmath2 ions closer to the real system .",
    "it would be closer to the actual materials to include a direct hopping between v@xmath4 sites .",
