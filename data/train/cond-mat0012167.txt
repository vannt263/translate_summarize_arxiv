    "it has long been known that atomic clusters of some fcc metals occur in stable arrangements quite different from the bulk crystal structure .",
    "regular non - crystalline structures , with five - fold axes of symmetry , were first identified in gold @xcite , and are known to occur in a variety of metals @xcite .",
    "the stability of these arrangements relies on a high proportion of surface atoms .",
    "for example , a 4  nm fcc lead cluster has roughly 40  % of its atoms at the surface .",
    "the local environment of surface atoms is quite different to those inside , and leads to distinct surface properties which play an important role in the overall behaviour of the cluster .",
    "although the observation of five - fold axes of symmetry in gold clusters was unexpected , it was immediately recognized that slightly deformed fcc tetrahedral units could be assembled to form these structures @xcite .",
    "these alternative structures afford a net gain in binding energy for the cluster : the strain of deforming fcc tetrahedral units , and the energy cost of twinning , is compensated for by a higher proportion of atoms in densely packed outer faces than can occur in any faceting of a perfect fcc particle @xcite .",
    "two characteristic types of non - crystalline structure occur : the icosahedron consists of twenty tetrahedra assembled around a common apex ; the decahedron arranges five tetrahedra around a common edge . in each , deformation of the tetrahedra is necessary to fill the volume of the polyhedron .",
    "this lowers the symmetry of the fcc lattice to either rhombohedral ( icosahedron ) or body - centered orthorhombic ( decahedron ) @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "adjacent tetrahedral faces meet at a twin plane , hence the name multiply twinned particle ( mtp ) .",
    "packing of atoms to make a given polyhedral form leads to sequences of atom numbers at which complete outer layers , or shells , are  closed \" ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "each sequence depends on the particular polyhedral model .",
    "for example , there are two fcc cuboctahedron sequences commonly considered : one with equilateral triangular ( 111 ) facets , the other with hexagonal ( 111 ) facets .",
    "the closed - shell sequences for these are , respectively : 13 , 55 , 147 , 309 , 561 , etc ; and 38 , 201 , 586 , 1289 , etc . the hexagonal faceted cuboctahedron is often called the  wulff \" form , because , for noble metals , it is close to the so - called wulff polyhedron , which minimizes the surface energy contribution in a small fcc crystal @xcite . in this work",
    "we generally use the terms wulff particle and cuboctahedron to refer to the hexagonal and triangular forms , respectively .",
    "elasticity theory can explain the form and stability of mtp structures , however , more detailed theoretical tools are needed to explore their properties : molecular dynamics ( md ) has been used for this purpose .",
    "classical md uses a mathematical model for the interaction potential between atoms , and the classical equations of motion , to simulate the dynamic behaviour of an @xmath0-atom aggregate over time under prescribed conditions of energy , temperature , etc .",
    "the technique is computationally intensive , but gains in computing power continue to allow more elaborate and realistic simulations to be performed .    of the fcc metals , gold clusters , in particular , have been extensively studied by md using many - body inter - atomic potentials @xcite .",
    "early studies of the energetics of relaxed gold clusters suggested that crystalline structures were favoured over mtp structures @xcite .",
    "later investigations suggested that a truncated marks decahedron @xcite may be the preferred low - temperature cluster geometry , when there are less than about 250 atoms in the cluster , and a wulff - particle form for larger clusters @xcite .",
    "further studies have found that disordered structures prevail for certain small cluster sizes@xcite .",
    "md has also been used to investigate the coalescence of gold clusters in collisions @xcite , structural transitions in gold clusters prior to melting @xcite and the growth of silver clusters from small seed clusters by collision @xcite .",
    "the case of lead clusters has received much less attention than gold .",
    "the first comprehensive molecular dynamics study , by lim , ong and ercolessi @xcite , utilised a many - body  glue \" potential to compare the energetics of certain fcc and mtp structures for a range of cluster sizes .",
    "in particular , these authors compared the energetics of the cuboctahedron and icosahedron sequences of closed - shell structures ( the numbers of atoms in the icosahedron sequence , conveniently , is the same as those in the cuboctahedron sequence ) .",
    "this allowed them to directly compare the binding energies at the same numbers of atoms for each structure and they demonstrated that the fcc crystalline structures ( cuboctahedra ) were favored over icosahedra for all sizes where the glue potential is expected to hold ( considered to be clusters with more than 200 atoms @xcite ) .",
    "however , subsequent simulations by these authors @xcite , involving the quenching of a large ( 8217-atom ) liquid lead droplet , produced a cluster that was  icosahedron - like \" .",
    "although known not to be the lowest energy arrangement for that number of atoms , it was assumed to have formed because of insufficiently long equilibration times in the simulation .",
    "the purpose of this work is to take a more comprehensive look at lead clusters by considering a wider range of structures and more variety in cluster sizes than in previous studies .",
    "we have also conducted simulations of longer duration .",
    "we begin by outlining the details of our computational procedure .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of the trends in binding energy for crystalline and non - crystalline model structures over cluster sizes from 200 to 6000 atoms .",
    "we then consider the melting and freezing of fcc clusters .",
    "sections [ sec_resol_ico ] and [ sec_resol_cub ] then examine the structure and energetics of clusters produced by freezing liquid droplets . finally , we look at the characteristic diffraction patterns produced by some md - derived cluster structures .",
    "molecular dynamics was performed using a local version of the classical molecular dynamics code alcmd , originally developed by ames laboratory .",
    "simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble ( i.e. constant temperature ) to produce caloric curves in section iv and v. the microcanonical ensemble ( i.e. constant energy ) was used to study re - solidification in section v and vi .",
    "the time step was chosen as @xmath1 throughout .",
    "simulations were typically allowed to equilibrate for @xmath2 time steps , or approximately one nanosecond .",
    "longer equilibration times ( up to @xmath3 time steps ) were used near transition points and in re - solidification studies . following the equilibration period , quantities reported here ( such as energies )",
    "were obtained by time - averaging over @xmath4 further steps .",
    "the inter - atomic potential used is due to lim , ong and ercolessi @xcite .",
    "this is a many - body glue - type potential , given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a short - range two - body potential and @xmath7 is a many - body glue term which reflects the effects of the conduction electrons in the metal .",
    "the @xmath8 is a generalized coordination where @xmath9 is some short - ranged function .",
    "the three functions @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 have been obtained by fitting to a number of known properties of lead including cohesive energy , surface energy , elastic constants , phonon frequencies , thermal expansion and melting temperature @xcite .",
    "this potential has been used previously to model lead clusters @xcite , temperature - dependent surface reconstructions of low - index lead surfaces @xcite and pre - melting of low - index lead surfaces @xcite . while the potential has been fitted to bulk properties of lead , the clusters studied here are sufficiently large that ( [ glue ] ) should be considered quantitatively reliable .",
    "common neighbor analysis @xcite ( cna ) has been used to analyse cluster structures @xcite .",
    "cna is a decomposition of the radial distribution function ( rdf ) according to the local environment of each pair .",
    "we consider that the first peak in the rdf represents  bonded \" neighbors . as such ,",
    "if @xmath10 is the first minimum in the rdf , we classify any pair separated by @xmath11 as a bonded pair . with this identification",
    ", any pair contributing to the rdf can be classified by a set of three indices , @xmath12 , which provide information on the local environment of the pair .",
    "the first index , @xmath13 , is the number of bonded neighbors common to both atoms .",
    "the second index , @xmath14 , is the number of bonds between this set of common neighbors .",
    "the third index , @xmath15 , is the number of bonds in the longest continuous chain formed by the @xmath14 bonds between common neighbors .",
    "figure  [ 421 ] shows a 421-pair ( light grey ) , with four common neighbors ( dark grey ) , two bonds ( black ) and a longest chain of one bond .",
    "figure  [ r_fcc959 ] shows a 959-atom crystalline structure , formed by relaxing a ball of lead atoms  cut \" from the fcc lattice . noting that the incomplete outer shell has plates of atoms on hexagonal ( 111 ) faces , we characterise this structure as an incomplete wulff particle .",
    "the cna decomposition of the first peak in the rdf for this cluster is shown in figure  [ cna_fcc200 ] . here",
    ", the rdf has been averaged over 100 time steps after the cluster was brought to thermal equilibrium at 200 k. the dominant contribution to the first peak comes from 421-pairs .",
    "this is characteristic of bulk fcc structure : each atom in a fcc crystal has twelve nearest neighbors and each of the pairs formed with these neighbors is a 421-pair .",
    "also apparent are 311-pairs , which predominantly arise from atoms on a ( 111 ) fcc face , and 211-pairs , which predominantly arise from atoms on a ( 100 ) fcc face .",
    "one other pair type that contributes only weakly to the first peak ( and is thus difficult to distinguish in the decomposition shown in figure  [ cna_fcc200 ] ) is the 200-pair , which is associated with atoms at the edges of the incomplete outermost atomic layer of this cluster .",
    "cna is useful here because it allows one to distinguish between local atomic arrangements , including fcc and icosahedral environments . in table  [ cna ]",
    "we have listed the classifications of cna signatures used here to label the local environment of an atom ( this classification is similar but not identical to that used by cleveland , luedtke and landman@xcite ) .",
    "we note that these signatures are based only on the cna decomposition of the first peak in the rdf .",
    "figure  [ sig_959_200 ] shows the results of this classification scheme applied to the relaxed crystalline 959-atom structure of figure  [ r_fcc959 ] .",
    "here we see that predominantly fcc - bulk atoms with ( 111)-face atoms , ( 100)-face atoms and ( 111)/(100 ) edge atoms are present .",
    ".description of cna signatures used .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     [ shaved ]      in this section we have examined a total of twenty - five 2057-atom cluster structures produced by re - solidification at constant - energy using the scheme outlined in the previous section .",
    "this enables us to investigate the reproducibility of the `` shaved '' icosahedron structures .",
    "the distribution of binding energies for the twenty - five re - solidified clusters is shown in figure  [ energy - dist ] .",
    "two re - solidified clusters were characterised by cna analysis as wulff particles , with energies of 1.882 ev / atom ( equal to the binding energy for a perfect geometric wulff particle ) .",
    "the remaining twenty - three were `` shaved '' icosahedra ( energies above 1.884 ev / atom ) .",
    "the two `` shaved '' icosahedra with energy 1.884 - 1.885 ev / atom had surface defects ( one edge not shaved ) . however , the majority of the `` shaved '' icosahedra are clustered about an average energy of 1.887 ev / atom .",
    "thus we can see that with equilibration times of 10 ns kinetic trapping in less optimal structures is uncommon .",
    "the repeated occurrence of the `` shaved '' icosahedron structure in these trials suggests that it is the preferred structure at this size for the potential ( [ glue ] ) .",
    "this method did not produce any structures which were energetically more favoured than the `` shaved '' icosahedra in any of the trials .",
    "furthermore , these `` shaved '' icosahedra appear upon re - solidification using both constant temperature ( section iv ) and constant energy ( section v ) simulations at a variety of temperatures , cooling rates and equilibration times ( up to the 10 ns used in this section ) . in the next section",
    ", we see that by heating geometric icosahedra , a transformation to `` shaved '' icosahedra occurs prior to melting .      in this section",
    "we show that geometric icosahedra can be induced by heating ( below the melting point ) to form `` shaved '' icosahedra in the same manner as that seen by doye and wales @xcite .",
    "figure  [ ico_str ] shows the caloric curve for two icosahedron clusters of 923 and 2057 atoms .",
    "these clusters have been prepared by first relaxing a geometric icosahedron to 0  k. the clusters were then brought to equilibrium at 100  k , and then heated in steps of 25  k to 300  k. at each temperature , the clusters were allowed to equilibrate over @xmath16 time steps at constant temperature . between 200  k and 250   k , the energy of clusters is seen to drop sharply , suggesting a change in cluster structure .",
    "the new structure that appears at temperatures above this transition point is essentially the same as the `` shaved '' icosahedron clusters obtained in the previous section after re - solidification .",
    "we see that geometric icosahedra relax to the equilibrium configuration ( the `` shaved '' icosahedron ) once heated to a certain temperature .",
    "the temperature at which this relaxation occurs is seen to depend on cluster size ( which determines the energy barrier for this process ) but will also depend on the time scale of the simulation .",
    "here we discuss the structure of the re - solidified 6525-atom crystalline structure ( shown in figure  [ cube ] ) produced by freezing a 6525-atom icosahedron using the constant energy method outlined in section  [ structure ] .",
    "apparent in figure  [ cube ] is the appearance of hexagonal ( 111 ) faces .",
    "this is interesting because a 6525-atom cluster can form a perfect , closed - shell , cuboctahedron with triangular faces but not a perfect wulff particle ( cuboctahedron with hexagonal faces ) .",
    "the average binding energy per atom of this re - solidified cluster is 1.92953 ev , as opposed to the binding energy of 1.92982 ev for a model 6525-atom cuboctahedron with triangular ( 111 ) faces .",
    "the difference of 0.3 mev per atom , in favour of the cuboctahedron with triangular ( 111 ) faces , does not explain the preference for the wulff form .",
    "however , it is probable that the wulff particle represents a local minimum in the energy in configuration space and that the liquid droplet is closer in configuration space , due to spherical symmetry , to this form of cuboctahedron . a lengthier relaxation period upon re - solidification may see the cluster form a cuboctahedron with triangular ( 111 ) faces .",
    "the cna classification of the re - solidified cluster is given in figure  [ sig_6525 ] .",
    "the profile is essentially fcc , except for the large number of type - e atoms .",
    "these arise from internal stacking - fault defects in the structure , either when a twin plane occurs ( the fcc ( 111 ) packing sequence goes , e.g. : ... abccbac ... ) , or when a skip ( deformation fault ) in the sequence occurs ( e.g. : ... abccabc ... ) .",
    "note that the stacking fault planes are all oriented in the same direction .",
    "the signature e classification ( table  [ cna ] ) is based on the decomposition of the first peak of the rdf , and does not distinguish between the two types of defect ( although it would be useful to do so @xcite ) .",
    "the e - type fault planes are shown in figure  [ fault ] . ignoring the cap regions ,",
    "there is a set of four consecutive fault planes in the upper half of the cluster which is a series of deformation faults that has effectively produced a narrow band of hexagonal - close - packed structure . in the lower half of the cluster ,",
    "a pair of deformation fault planes occur , and below them is a single twin - plane fault .",
    "diffraction is a valuable experimental probe of nanoparticle structure @xcite .",
    "the diffraction pattern of a nanoparticle sample is a  powder \" pattern with radially symmetric intensity that can readily be calculated from the radial distribution function , using the debye equation of kinematic diffraction theory @xcite .",
    "the so - called `` interference function '' is closely related to the distribution of intensity in an experimental diffraction pattern and is given by    @xmath17    where the scattering parameter @xmath18 , with @xmath19 equal to half the scattering angle and @xmath20 the wavelength of the radiation .",
    "@xmath21 is the number of atoms in the cluster and @xmath22 is the inter - atomic distance between atoms @xmath23 and @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath24 is dimensionless ; it is related to the distribution scattered intensity , but is independent of the type of radiation and , for monoatomic clusters , the atomic scattering factor @xcite .",
    "it is generally difficult to interpret diffraction measurements on nanoparticles because of the likely occurrence of non - crystalline and imperfect structures , as well as sample size distribution and inhomogeneity , so the standard techniques of x - ray crystallography do not apply .",
    "determination of structure is usually based on the careful comparison of experimental data with diffraction patterns calculated from models of particle structures .",
    "when a close correspondence between observations and model - based profiles is obtained , the principal characteristics of the model structure can generally be inferred to exist in the actual cluster sample .",
    "the best known and most successful example of this approach is probably the electron diffraction studies of rare - gas clusters that were interpreted using md models @xcite .    typically in experimental studies ,",
    "geometric models are used to provide the needed candidate diffraction profiles .",
    "thus it is of interest to consider how md models of structure compare with geometrical models . with this in mind",
    ", we consider the interference functions of the two larger clusters that have been generated by re - solidification in this study .",
    "figure  [ fig_dif_3428 ] shows the pattern obtained from the 3428-atom cluster , and figure  [ fig_dif_6525 ] shows the pattern for the 6525-atom cluster .",
    "the 3428-atom cluster was obtained after melting a decahedron , so in figure  [ fig_dif_3428 ] we also show the interference pattern of a 9-shell decahedron ( 3428 atoms  the initial structure ) and a 9-shell icosahedron ( 2869 atoms ) .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "the md simulated cluster has a smoother interference function that either of the geometric models ; the features are broader and the md profile is also noticeably attenuated with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "this is all consistent with a high degree of static disorder in the md structure .",
    "the four significant peaked features in the md curve ( at : @xmath26 0.37 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.9 ) are more closely matched by the profile of the icosahedron , although the decahedron also has peaks at these positions . in either case , the position of the features in the md profile is shifted to higher @xmath25 ( the shift is about @xmath27 ) , indicating a contraction of the length scale for the md structure of the order of 3  % , compared to the geometric forms .    clearly , from the viewpoint of a diffraction measurements , our md cluster would be better matched by icosahedral models than either fcc structures or decahedra .",
    "diffraction therefore supports cna in this case , although they are fundamentally different types of analysis : cna characterises the local environment of atom pairs , whereas diffraction is a reciprocal space view of the radial distribution function , and hence tends to identify longer range correlations in a structure .",
    "the 6525-atom cluster has been identified by cna as having the fcc structure of the bulk . nevertheless , figure  [ fig_dif_6525 ] shows , again , the attenuation of the structure s interference function with increasing @xmath25 , indicating substantial disorder .",
    "figure [ fig_dif_6525 ] also shows an interference function calculated for an ensemble of perfect twinned structures . these were fcc ball clusters with random stacking faults along the ( 111 ) axis .",
    "a set of 25 interference functions from such models were averaged to produce the profile shown .",
    "the main features of the md structure interference function coincide with the model ensemble pattern , although the relative intensities differ substantially .",
    "it is also interesting that the location of features in the md profile and the static models profile are not shifted , as they were for the 3428-atom structure .",
    "this means that the lattice parameter predicted by the md simulation agrees with the bulk value used to construct the models .",
    "we have considered the binding energies of relaxed lead clusters for a range of particle sizes and cluster structures using the `` glue '' potential ( [ glue ] ) . for medium cluster sizes ( 600 to 4000 atoms )",
    ", we found that a surface - reconstructed icosahedron structure was the lowest energy structure of those considered .",
    "these are shaved icosahedra , with atoms removed from the edges and missing five - fold apex atoms , and surface atoms relocated to form a stacking fault with respect to the internal fcc tetrahedra of the icosahedron .",
    "earlier theoretical studies of the energetics of mtps by marks @xcite , suggested that the removal of icosahedral apex atoms would lead to improvements in energy .",
    "this was supported by atomistic energy calculations for lennard - jones clusters @xcite , but not in the case of nickel @xcite . in practice , it would be virtually impossible to observe this shaving by microscopy , as explained by buffat , fleli , spycher , stadelman and borel @xcite , and we are not aware of any reported observations .",
    "however , when indeed microscopy can identify cluster structure as icosahedral , particles generally appear to be imperfect @xcite .",
    "this raises the interesting possibility that the md structures grown here may compare well with typical high - resolution images of some small particles .    in this work",
    "we did not identify signs of icosahedral precursors to melting as reported in simulations of gold clusters@xcite .",
    "these , however , might be revealed by constant energy simulations ( as used in the studies of gold@xcite ) of fcc clusters near the melting point .",
    "we speculate here that these precursors , if found , will tend to resemble our shaved icosahedral structure more closely than the geometric icosahedra .",
    "indeed , in section  [ instab ] , we saw that by heating , geometric icosahedra could be induced to undergo a surface reconstruction to the shaved icosahedra prior to melting .",
    "our finding that icosahedron , rather than fcc , structures are preferred for certain sizes contrasts with an earlier md study of lead that used exactly the same potential model , but with shorter simulation times @xcite,@xcite .",
    "while at the time of that study there were no experimental reports of lead icosahedra , a recent investigation has indicated that they do occur abundantly @xcite .",
    "electron diffraction experiments on a beam unsupported lead clusters has identified both decahedral and icosahedral signatures in the diffraction patterns for beams with average cluster size ranging between approximately 3 and 6  nm .",
    "preliminary analysis of those results has relied on geometric models of cluster structures , however the icosahedral component in the data is strong and unambiguous . on the other hand , the decahedral component , identified in larger clusters , may also be compatible with the kind of imperfect and faulted structure that has been obtained in the present study for the 6525-atom cluster .",
    "the imperfect structure of this 6525-atom cluster is interesting from the perspective of experimental observations .",
    "the cluster s main feature is a series of ( 111 ) stacking faults , all parallel to the same axis .",
    "these are mainly deformation faults , although one twin plane is present .",
    "very recently , de feraudy and torchet commented that parallel stacking faults were most unlikely to occur in unsupported argon clusters @xcite .",
    "our findings suggest that , for lead , this may not be the case .",
    "if so , this poses yet more difficulty in interpreting cluster diffraction measurements .",
    "de feraudy and torchet point out that if faulted clusters of this type are to be considered , then crystallographic - based calculations based on a faulted bulk crystal model are not satisfactory : detailed atomistic modeling is required @xcite .",
    "however , our simple attempt to produce approximate atomistic models of clusters containing parallel fault planes have been unsatisfactory . as shown in figure [ fig_dif_6525 ] , the degree of accord with the md structure is quite poor , and would not be accepted in an objective analysis of real experimental data .    in conclusion ,",
    "md simulations of lead clusters have identified new non - crystalline low energy structures after re - solidification of medium - sized liquid droplets .",
    "these forms are surface reconstructed icosahedra ; their binding energies are higher than the corresponding perfect ( relaxed ) icosahedron as well as the wulff form .",
    "we have also shown that sufficiently large liquid droplets re - solidify into imperfect crystalline structures , resembling the wulff particle , provided adequate equilibration times are used .",
    "we have made a preliminary investigation of the effects of temperature on structure , noting the appearance of stacking faults at the surface of incomplete cuboctahedra and a similar solid - to - solid structural transition in geometric icosahedra .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the use of the ames laboratory classical md code .",
    "we are also grateful to f. ercolessi for making the lead `` glue '' potential freely available .",
    "we would also like to thank jonathon doye for his comments ."
