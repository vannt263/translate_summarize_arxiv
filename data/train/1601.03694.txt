    "the fate of a molecule after excitation with light is determined by its excited ( bare ) state potential energy surface .",
    "while most molecules make their way back to the ground state by spontaneous emission or non - radiative relaxation , some dissociate , isomerize , or are funneled through conical intersections ( coin ) @xcite .",
    "the reactivity can be manipulated either by chemical modification , changing the environment , or by using photons to interact with the molecule while it evolves in an excited states .",
    "it has been shown theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite that light can actively influence the molecular reactivity .",
    "the modified photonic vacuum in nano scale fabricated cavities allows for influencing molecular potential energy surfaces in a nondestructive manner and without the use of external laser fields .",
    "substantial couplings can be induced between electronic states with just a single photon @xcite .",
    "the radiation matter coupling is enhanced in small cavity modes @xcite and the strong coupling regime may be realized even when the field is in the vacuum state @xcite .",
    "the strongly coupled molecule+field states are known as dressed atomic states @xcite or polaritons @xcite .",
    "recent experimental developments show promising results , paving the way for strong coupling in the single molecule regime .",
    "strong coupling can be achieved in nano cavities @xcite , nano plasmon antennas @xcite , and nano guides @xcite . chemical reactivity can be influenced in a very distinct way in this regime .",
    "this provides great potential for the manipulation and control of e.g. the photo - stability of molecules , novel types of light induced coins , or modifying existing coins .",
    "specially tailored nano structured materials may then serve as a photonic catalysts that can be used instead of chemical catalysts . in a recent theoretical paper galego et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out the impact of strong coupling on the absorption spectrum of molecules .    in the strong coupling regime the molecular and the photon degrees of freedom are heavily entangled and the molecular bare states do not provide a good basis .",
    "the quantization of the radiation field has to be taken into account .",
    "this has been first described theoretically in the jaynes - cummings model @xcite which assumes an electronic two level system coupled to a single field mode and has been experimentally applied to atoms @xcite in molecules the nuclear degrees of freedom must be taken into account as well @xcite .",
    "the product basis of electronic and photonic states is not adequate in the strong coupling regime . diagonalizing the system to the dressed basis recovers potential energy surfaces but",
    "also leads to light induced avoided crossing and actual curve crossings between the dressed states , analogous to avoided crossings and coins .",
    "the dynamics of the nuclei , electrons , and photons are strongly coupled in the vicinity of these crossings and pose formidable computational challenge .",
    "strong coupling to one or more radiation field modes can alter the molecular levels , profoundly affecting the basic photophysical and photochemical processes .",
    "the obvious way to achieve this regime is by subjecting the molecule to strong laser fields @xcite .",
    "alternatively the coupling can be enhanced by placing the molecule in a cavity and letting it interact with the localized cavity modes .",
    "the coupling increases with @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mode volume .",
    "strong fields are not necessary in this case and the field can be even in the vacuum state .",
    "the former scenario can be realized with classical fields .",
    "this paper focuses on this latter , which involves quantum fields @xcite .",
    "a major difference between the two scenarios is the number of photons available in the dressing field .",
    "a strong laser field can give rise to multiphoton absorption and multiphoton ionization pathways that can interfere with the intended manipulation of the quantum system .",
    "we develop a formalism , which allows to express the dressed states and the non - adiabatic couplings in terms of readily accessible molecular properties like the bare state potential energy surfaces and the transition dipole moments that can be extracted from standard quantum chemistry calculations .",
    "we demonstrate how chemical reactions can be modified by applying this theoretical framework to typical model systems .",
    "we focus on a moderate coupling strength where the dressed state energies are not well separated but experience curve crossings giving rise to non - adiabatic dynamics .    the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] we present the formalism by including the nuclear degrees of freedom into the jaynes - cummings model . in section [ sec : photochemistry ] we present three models of molecular systems strongly coupled to the cavity .",

    "<S> strong coupling of molecules to the vacuum field of micro cavities can modify the potential energy surfaces opening new photophysical and photochemical reaction pathways . while the influence of laser fields is usually described in terms of classical field , </S>",
    "<S> coupling to the vacuum state of a cavity has to be described in terms of dressed photon - matter states ( polaritons ) which require quantized fields . </S>",
    "<S> we present a derivation of the non - adiabatic couplings for single molecules in the strong coupling regime suitable for the calculation of the dressed state dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism allows to use quantities readily accessible from quantum chemistry codes like the adiabatic potential energy surfaces and dipole moments to carry out wave packet simulations in the dressed basis . </S>",
    "<S> the implications for photochemistry are demonstrated for a set of model systems representing typical situations found in molecules . </S>"
