    "the main goal is to provide data to study the formation and subsequent dynamical , chemical and star formation evolution of the milky way galaxy @xcite .",
    "_ gaia _ will achieve this by providing an all - sky astrometric and photometric survey complete to 20  mag in unfiltered light . during the mission , on - board",
    "object detection will be employed and more than 1  billion stars will be observed ( as well as non - stellar objects to similar completeness limits ) . the full mission ( 5-years ) mean - sky parallax accuracies are expected to be around 7  microarcsec at @xmath0 , @xmath1@xmath2  microarcsec at @xmath3 and @xmath4@xmath5  microarcsec at @xmath6 ( depending on spectral type ) .",

    "the photometric measurements provide the basic diagnostics for classifying all objects as stars , quasars , solar - system objects , or otherwise , and for parametrizing them according to their nature .",
    "stellar classification and parametrization across the entire hertzsprung - russell diagram is required as well as the identification of peculiar objects .",
    "this demands observation in a wide wavelength range , extending from the ultraviolet to the far - red .",
    "the photometric data must determine : ( i ) effective temperatures and reddening at least for o - b - a stars ( needed both as tracers of galactic spiral arms and as reddening probes ) , ( ii ) at least effective temperatures and abundances for f - g - k - m giants and dwarfs , ( iii ) luminosities ( gravities ) for stars having large relative parallax errors ,",
    "( iv ) indications of unresolved multiplicity and peculiarity , and",
    "( v ) a map of the interstellar extinction in the galaxy .",
    "all of this has to be done with an accuracy sufficient for stellar age determination in order to allow for a quantitative description of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the galaxy over all galactocentric distances .",
    "separate determination of fe- and @xmath9-element abundances is essential for mapping galactic chemical evolution and understanding the formation of the galaxy .",
    "photometry is also crucial to identify and characterize the set of @xmath10 quasars that the mission will detect .",
    "apart from being astrophysically interesting in their own right , quasars are key - objects for defining the fixed , non - rotating _ gaia _ celestial reference frame , the optical equivalent of the international celestial reference frame @xcite . on the other hand , _ gaia",
    "_ will identify about 900 quasars with multiple images produced by macrolensing .",
    "since this number is sensitive to cosmological parameters , the _ gaia _ observations will be able to constrain the latter .",
    "due to diffraction and the optical aberrations of the instrument , the position of the centre of the stellar images is wavelength dependent . to achieve the microarcsec accuracy level , astrometry has to be corrected for this chromatic aberration through the knowledge of the spectral energy distribution of the observed objects .",
    "photometry is indispensable for this .",
    "if uncorrected , chromatic errors could reach several milliarcsec , cf .  section  [ sec : chroma ] .    as explained in the following sections ,",
    "the photometric systems proposed during the long development of _ gaia _ have been improved along with the increasing collecting area of the telescopes , with better insight in the astrophysical requirements , and with the development of mathematical tools to compare the various proposed systems .",
    "the use of ccds in a scanning astrometry satellite was first proposed in 1992 @xcite as the _ roemer _ project .",
    "the proposal included five broad passbands , _ ubvri _ , which would obtain much better precision than the @xmath11 of _ hipparcos - tycho _ although with a similar collecting aperture .",
    "the _ gaia _ collecting area has increased by up to 10  times with respect to _",
    "roemer _ and consequently the initial photometric system has been upgraded several times .",
    "eight medium - width passbands were proposed by @xcite , and spectrophotometry instead of filter photometry was also considered in @xcite .",
    "a system of four broad and eleven medium - width passbands was proposed by @xcite and adopted in the ` _ gaia _ study report ' @xcite .",
    "the subsequent developments and updates have yielded the present baseline with five broad- and fourteen medium - width passbands .",
    "this paper deals with the definition of the photometric system , the relationship of its passbands with the stellar astrophysical diagnostics and the evaluation of its performance in terms of the astrophysical parametrization of single stars .",
    "this is based on the specific design implementation of the payload commonly referred to as _ gaia_-2 ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : instrument ] ) applicable at the end of the technology assessment phase as of mid-2005 .",
    "the resulting astrometric and photometric requirements form the basis of the industrial specifications for the satellite implementation phase , with the consequence that the detailed design , due for finalisation early in 2007 , may differ in detail from the present description .",
    "nevertheless , the principles and objectives as well as the methods and assessment tools described in this paper will remain applicable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : instrument ] describes the mission observation strategy , telescopes and focal planes .",
    "section  [ sec : g ] deals with the measurement of the unfiltered light in the fields of view .",
    "the principles of designing the multi - colour photometric system are outlined in section  [ sec : design_ps ] and the purpose of the broad- and medium - passbands is discussed in detail in section  [ sec : bbpmbp ] .",

    "the performance of the photometric system with respect to astrophysical parameter determination is quantified in section  [ sec : phot_performances ] . in section",
    "[ sec : galaxy ] the potential of the photometric system for galactic structure and evolution studies as well as the performances for qsos are outlined .",

    "stars brighter than @xmath3412  mag pose a special challenge .",

    "_ gaia _ will perform measurements by means of two physically distinct instruments , with different viewing directions : the astro instrument , designed for astrometric and broad - band photometric observations , and the spectro instrument , used for medium - band photometry and radial - velocity measurements .",
    "astro and spectro differ in spatial resolution , available integration time , the number and type of passbands that can be used , and in telescope transmission and detector characteristics ( table  [ tab : instruments ] and figure  [ fig : fpas ] ) .",
    "the astrometric focal plane incorporates three functions : ( i ) the sky mapper ; ( ii ) the main astrometric field ; and ( iii ) the broad - band photometer ( bbp ; section  [ sec : section_bbp ] ) .",
    "bbp is mainly aimed at sampling the spectral energy distribution of objects over a wide wavelength range to allow on - ground correction of image centroids measured in the main astrometric field for systematic chromatic shifts caused by aberrations .",
    "in addition , bbp measurements contribute to the astrophysical characterisation of objects , especially in dense stellar fields .    through implementation of a dichroic beam splitter ,",
    "the spectro instrument serves two distinct focal planes : one for the radial - velocity spectrometer ( rvs ) , and one for the medium - band photometer ( mbp ; section  [ sec : section_mbp ] ) .",
    "the spectro / mbp focal plane incorporates two functions : ( i ) a sky mapper ; and ( ii ) the mbp instrument .",
    "the main goal of mbp is to determine the astrophysical parameters of objects , which , in combination with the astrometric measurements , will enable astronomers to fulfil _ gaia _ s main science objective .",
    "rvs observes a spectral region around 860  nm at a nominal resolution of @xmath35 .",
    "its main aim is to determine radial velocities for bright stars , down to @xmath36@xmath37  mag . for the brightest ones ,",
    "astrophysical parametrization is also foreseen .",
    "the angular resolution of the instruments allows photometry to be obtained at stellar densities up to @xmath38 stars / sq  deg in the bbp and up to @xmath39@xmath40 stars / sq  deg in the mbp ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec : crowded ] ) .",
    "the resolution limit for double stars is about @xmath41@xmath42 arcsec in the astro field and @xmath43@xmath44 arcsec in the mbp .",
    "both sky mappers work in unfiltered light and allow autonomous object detection and confirmation , including rejection of prompt particle events ( cosmic rays , solar protons , etc . ) .",
    "detection and confirmation probabilities are a function of magnitude and object density in the field of view .",
    "they are effectively unity up to the survey limit ( 20  mag ) dropping quickly to zero for fainter objects @xcite . on - board",
    "object detection has several advantages : ( i ) sampling of detected objects can be limited to ` windows ' , i.e. , areas centred on the object @xcite ; this allows to flush useless pixels containing empty sky , which is of benefit to both ccd read - out noise and the data volume to be transmitted to ground ;",
    "( ii ) it allows the unbiased detection of all objects , assuring that the resulting catalogue will be complete to the survey limit ; and ( iii ) unpredictable ` peculiar objects ' , such as supernovae or solar - system objects , will be observed , if brighter than the detection limit . moreover , on - board",
    "detection is mandatory as no input catalogue exists which is complete to the survey limit at the _ gaia _ spatial resolution .",
    "_ gaia _ s astrometric observations are made without a filter in order to minimize photon noise .",
    "the mirror coatings and ccd qe effectively define a broad ( white - light ) passband , called @xmath32 ( section  [ sec : g ] ) .",
    "the astro focal plane receives the light from the superposition of two viewing directions on the sky , separated by the so - called ` basic angle ' , of order @xmath45 .",
    "this superposition of the two fields of view will lead to a number of complications in the data processing , but throughout this paper we only consider the first order effect of the doubling of the diffuse sky - background .",
    "the bbp consists of 40 ccds , arranged in 4 across - scan strips and 10 along - scan rows ( the _ gaia _ naming convention for the along - scan direction is rows of ccds and columns of ccd pixels , and across - scan we speak of strips of ccds and lines of pixels ) . in principle",
    ", the filters can be distributed among the 40 ccds in any combination that is desirable from a scientific point of view .",
    "a preferable situation , for example for variable - star science , would be to have identical filters on each of the 10 ccd rows within a single ccd strip : this would yield quasi - simultaneous measurements in the different passbands on each field - of - view crossing , independent of an object s across - scan coordinate .",
    "such a solution would , however , limit the number of bbp passbands to the number of ccd strips , i.e. , 4 .",
    "the mbp consists of 40 ccds arranged in 20 strips and 2 rows .",
    "the ccds in the first 10 strips are illuminated directly from the spectro telescope .",
    "these ccds are red - enhanced , which means they are thicker than ` normal ccds ' and have a red - optimized anti - reflection coating .",
    "the ccds in the last 10 strips receive only the blue light from the spectro telescope .",
    "these detectors are blue - enhanced , which means they have the same thickness as ` normal ccds ' but a blue - optimized anti - reflection coating .",
    "four of the red - enhanced strips act as sky mappers and do not have filters ; the associated broad passband is called @xmath33 .",
    "the remaining 6 strips with red- and the 10 strips with blue - enhanced ccds may be equipped with filters , defining up to 16 different passbands , assuming the two ccd rows in each strip have identical filters ( for the sake of redundancy ) .",
    "one of the red passbands will cover the same spectral region as the rvs , around 860 nm , leaving 15 free strips .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 passbands corresponding to the white light observations in the astro and spectro instruments , respectively , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qe ] .",
    "they cover the wavelength range from 400 to 1000  nm and 350 to 1025  nm , with the maximum energy transmission at @xmath46 and @xmath47  nm and the full width at half maximum of 408 and 456  nm , respectively for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "the background and the read - out noise , precisions of @xmath51 and @xmath52  millimag are achievable at @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that the precision of the @xmath32 measurements is ultimately limited by the calibration errors ( see section  [ sec : calibration ] ) .",
    "_ gaia _ will provide distances at the 10% accuracy level for some 100200 million stars , which combined with estimates of the @xmath32 magnitude and the interstellar extinction , will yield unprecedented absolute magnitudes , in both accuracy and number .",
    "the @xmath32 passband also yields the best signal to noise ratio for variability detection among all the _ gaia _ passbands .",
    "_ gaia _ will monitor millions of variable stars ( eclipsing binaries , cepheids , rr  lyrae , mira - lpvs , etc ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide comparisons with other variability surveys and a detailed discussion of the effects of the variable time sampling and number of observations due to the scanning law .",
    "many ground - based photometric systems ( pss ) exist but none satisfies all the requirements of a space - based mission such as _ gaia _ : portions of the spectrum limited on - ground by telluric o@xmath54 opacity in the blue and o@xmath55 and h@xmath55o absorption bands in the red are accessible to _ gaia _ ; existing pss have usually been designed for specific spectral type intervals or specific objects , while _ gaia _ photometry must deal with the entire hertzsprung - russell diagram , must allow taxonomy classification of solar - system objects and must be able to identify quasars and galaxies .",
    "in addition , _ gaia _ allows the extension of stellar photometry to galactic areas where the classical classification schemes may be no longer fully valid because of systematic variations in element abundances in stellar atmospheres and in interstellar matter . finally , _",
    "gaia _ has to astrophysically characterize objects over a very large range of brightness , from @xmath56 to the faint limit of @xmath57 , and consequently the width of the passbands will reflect a trade - off between sensitivity to physical parameters and the possibility to measure faint stars .",
    "therefore , designing a new ps is the best approach to ensuring that _ gaia _ s ambitious goals will be achieved .",
    "this became clear early on when initial efforts to use existing pss showed that these failed to cover all _ gaia _ requirements .",
    "a fairly complete census of existing pss can be found in @xcite .",
    "criteria for the design of a new ps have to be established _ a priori_. as it is widely known , narrow passbands are very efficient in measuring specific spectral features , but have low performance for faint objects ; broad passbands yield low photon - noise for faint objects but can not give one - to - one determination of astrophysical parameters .",
    "the ultraviolet contains important information on astrophysical parameters , but _",
    "gaia _ will not be able to measure faint red objects in this spectral range .",
    "therefore , a compromise between the different options ( number , location , and width of the passbands and their total exposure time ) is needed to achieve a ps that is maximally capable of separating objects with different astrophysical parameters in filter flux space .",
    "such a ps should allow both accurate _ discrete source classification _",
    "( i.e.  identification of stars , galaxies , qsos , solar - system objects , etc . ) and _ continuous parametrization _ ( values of astrophysical parameters , e.g.for stars @xmath58 , @xmath59}$ ] , etc ) for all _ gaia _ targets across the astrophysical parameter space .      over the years of mission study and development",
    ", the instrumental concept of _ gaia _ has evolved . as a consequence ,",
    "the requirements and constraints for designing the ps have evolved in terms of the number of passbands , the exposure time available per passband , the wavelength coverage in bbp and mbp , the spatial resolution of astro and spectro , the goals of bbp and mbp , the complementarity of bbp , mbp and rvs measurements , etc .    with the consolidation of the study - phase of the _ gaia _ instrument design , the requirements for bbp and mbp are stabilized .",
    "the ps accepted as the baseline for the mission and presented in this paper is based on the following constraints :    * the instrument design is as described in section  [ sec : instrument ] . *",
    "photometry from astro has to account for chromaticity in order to achieve microarcsec astrometry , which implies a measurement of the spectral energy distribution of each object with contiguous broad passbands covering the whole wavelength range of the @xmath32 passband ( see section  [ sec : chroma ] ) . *",
    "the photometry from spectro has to provide the astrophysical characterization of the observed objects .",
    "* the photometry from astro has to provide the astrophysical characterization of the observed objects in dense fields ( at stellar densities larger than @xmath39@xmath40 stars / sq  deg ; mainly in the bulge , some galactic disk areas and globular clusters ) .",
    "* one of the medium passbands in spectro has to measure the flux in the wavelength range covered by rvs ( 848874  nm ) . *",
    "the trigonometric parallax is available and has to be used to constrain the luminosity ( or the absolute magnitude ) . *",
    "the information from rvs is not used for designing the ps because of the different limiting magnitude and spatial resolution of that instrument ( in the actual _ gaia _ data processing it is foreseen that astrometry , photometry and rvs measurements will be used together to derive astrophysical parameters , when possible ) . * the _ gaia _ ps is optimized for single stars , where priority is given to those types crucial for achieving the _ gaia _ core science case , namely the unravelling of the structure and the formation history of the milky way .",

    "the global degeneracies of the ps have to be evaluated ( see section  [ sec : degen ] ) . *",
    "additional merits such as , for example , the performance with respect to discrete object classification , the performance for non - st objects , etc .",
    "have to be considered .",
    "the procedure to come to a baseline ps @xcite is based on the maximization of this ` figure of merit ' , a minimization of the global degeneracies and an evaluation of additional merits .

    "given the parallax , main sequence loci may be empirically constructed from nearby , unreddened samples provided by _",
    "gaia_. shifting these loci to a given distance with a given mean extinction identifies the main sequence in the observed colour - magnitude diagram ( including the photometric errors ) for a sample of main sequence stars selected from a small volume element in the galaxy .",
    "thus , main sequence fitting to such stellar samples , selected by means of the _ gaia _ parallaxes , could serve as the basis for a 3d extinction map @xcite . the chemical composition of the stars may be used to refine the definition of an appropriate main sequence , and @xmath60 to refine the selection of an appropriate stellar sample .",
    "this approach has the further advantage that the c1b passbands may be used in addition to the c1 m ones , and that stars along the entire main sequence will contribute to the estimation of extinction , including those located on the lower main sequence where extinction determination is otherwise difficult .",
    "the combination of _ gaia _ and external ir photometric data provides independent determinations of extinction . during the luminosity calibration of 2mass photometry for a9g5 main sequence stars , @xcite noticed significant reddening vectors in the @xmath66 vs. @xmath67 diagram where @xmath66 was estimated from _",
    "parallaxes @xmath68  milliarcsec and @xmath69 , assuming that reddening was negligible .",
    "these vectors are most pronounced for the a type stars but are also present for cooler ones . from these vectors the extinction law",
    "may be estimated even for various spectral classes if the stellar density is large enough .",
    "similar diagrams may be constructed from _ gaia _ astrometry and bbp and mbp for the optical region and for the near - infrared from the 2mass , ukidss and vista surveys so that regions with abnormal extinction can be identified .",
    "photometry will be crucial for absolute luminosity ( or gravity ) determination when relative parallax errors are larger than 1020% .",
    "the distances at which the relative parallax error is @xmath3410% are listed in table  [ distances ] as a function of spectral type and luminosity class in the absence of interstellar extinction , i.e.  similar to the galactic pole direction , and in the case of an average galactic plane interstellar extinction of 0.7 mag kpc@xmath8 .",
    "the parallax accuracies are from table 8.4 in the _ gaia _ study report @xcite . based on the besanon galaxy model @xcite ,",
    "some 100200 million stars are predicted to have parallaxes measured at the 10% accuracy level .",
    "absolute magnitude calibrations can be established using the stars with accurate parallaxes and interstellar extinction , and applied to more distant stars in the classical way , assuming that these are intrinsically similar to the accurate - parallax stars , which may not always be the case .",
    "thus luminosities with precision @xmath70@xmath71  mag ( or @xmath72@xmath73  dex ) from photometry are desirable to match the uncertainties of the well measured parallaxes .",
    "the main contributors to the photometric luminosity determination are the measurements of balmer and paschen jumps , the h@xmath9 index , the c1m395c1m410 vs. w(cat * ) diagram and c1m515 combined with contiguous pseudo - continuum passbands , as already noted in section  [ sec : bbpmbp ] .",
    "figures  [ fig : sigma_post1 ] , [ fig : sigma1 ] , and [ g15res ] show that @xmath72@xmath73  dex is achievable for giants and early type stars at large distances and therefore that the study of galactic structure on large scales ( warp , spiral arms , outer halo , etc ) is feasible . for nearby stars",
    "the photometric determination of @xmath60 is also possible but of less interest because of the good parallax precision . for distant late type dwarf stars ,",
    "i.e.  with parallax errors larger than 10% , the precision of the photometrically determined @xmath60 will be not as good as for giants and early type stars , as expected .",

    "although 1025 million stars with rvs chemical abundance determinations may seem little compared to the 1 billion objects observed by _ gaia _ , the spectroscopic chemical compositions are crucial as they will serve to calibrate the photometric data .",

    ", the same precision is attainable up to about 4 , 7 and 12  kpc in the centre , anti - centre and orthogonal galactic directions , respectively .",
    "this implies that the following issues ( and other goals ) can be addressed : the determination of the galactic chemical abundance gradient , the classification of the stars into different stellar populations , the characterization of halo streams , and the determination of the distance scale through the metallicity determination for rr - lyrae .",

    "the determination may be improved with the inclusion of parallax information , because it constrains the value of @xmath60 , which may break the degeneracy in the variation of the mg ib triplet due to luminosity and mg abundance changes . for stars fainter than @xmath89@xmath90 ,",
    "deriving @xmath9-elements abundances from photometry is unlikely .",
    "the location of a star in the hr - diagram does not allow for a unique age determination as several combinations of chemical composition ( @xmath59}$ ] , @xmath64 $ ] , @xmath91 , etc ) and age are possible ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "individually accurate ages require extremely accurate determinations of luminosity , temperature , reddening and chemical composition , which _ gaia _ will provide .    for ages around 1014  gyr , and assuming a given chemical composition , a change of @xmath92 by @xmath93  dex for the stars in the turn - off translates to an age variation of 2  gyr .",
    "thus , temperatures must be known with precisions better than a few hundredths in @xmath92 , i.e.  @xmath822% in @xmath58 , for the turn - off stars to determine individually accurate ages .",
    "a variation of 0.3  dex in @xmath59}$ ] is equivalent to a change of @xmath92 by @xmath93  dex for a given age .",

    "capabilities in the case of metal - poor stars have not yet been investigated .",
    "subsets of each galactic population ( such as globular clusters , open clusters , ob associations , a given halo stream , an identified merger , a moving group , etc . ) can be treated statistically and mean ages and chemical abundances of the group can be obtained with much better precisions than those of the individual members .",
    "the prospects for the determination of the age - metallicity relation and the star formation history with _ gaia _ are discussed by @xcite . assuming the errors on the astrophysical parameters from section  [ sec : phot_performances ]",
    ", the author recovers the simulated age metallicity relation in the case of moderate extinction and for a slowly varying star formation rate .",
    "the details of the star formation history , such as a series of prominent short bursts , are not recovered .",
    "qsos play an important role in the _ gaia _ mission as they will be used to construct the astrometric reference frame and they are of course interesting in their own right .",
    "however , since the qso population only represents 0.05% of the stellar population , building a _ secure _ qso sample with no stellar contamination requires a very efficient rejection algorithm .",
    "although proper motion , parallax and variability information will help in rejecting stars , these will be available with the required precision only at the end of the mission .",
    "therefore it is important to check the capability to classify qsos using only photometric data .",
    "the qso classification efficiencies of supervised nns and of mdms ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : nn ] ) have been compared using synthetic data generated from the basel 2.2 library for stars @xcite , from pure - hydrogen atmosphere models for white dwarfs ( koester , private communication ) and from a library of qso synthetic spectra @xcite .",
    "properly trained nns are found to be capable of rejecting virtually _ all _ stars , including white dwarfs .",
    "this is at the expense of the completeness level of the qso sample , being only @xmath103 at @xmath104 .",
    "however , this provides a sufficient number of objects in the context of the non - rotating extragalactic reference system determination .",
    "mdms provide a higher completeness level ( @xmath105 at @xmath104 ) , but with a correspondingly higher stellar contamination rate of the qso sample . mdms may be preferred at high galactic latitudes . not surprisingly , reddened qsos and weak emission - line objects are preferentially lost while high red - shift objects are most easily recognized .    assuming an object is a qso , it is also possible to infer its red - shift from its photometric signature in the c1b+c1 m passbands .",
    "unfortunately , there is a colour degeneracy in the qso spectra which limits the expected precision of the technique to about @xmath106 in the range @xmath107 ( computations were done with a previous version of the _ gaia _ ps but are not strongly sensitive to the adopted filter sets ) .",
    "more details on the identification and characterization of qsos with _",
    "gaia _ can be found in @xcite .",
    "to fully achieve the scientific goals of the _ gaia _ mission it is essential to complement the astrometric and radial velocity measurements with highly accurate multi - colour photometry .",
    "this is necessary both for obtaining accurate astrometry and for a proper scientific interpretation of the stereoscopic census of the galaxy _ gaia _ will provide .",
    "the latter goal requires that the photometric system for _ gaia _ is capable of astrophysically parametrizing 1  billion objects across the entire hertzsprung - russell diagram in the presence of varying degrees of reddening and for the full range of chemical compositions and ages of stars populating the galaxy , and , of identifying peculiar objects and qsos .    there are no existing photometric systems capable of handling this very demanding task .",
    "we therefore set out to design a new system for the _ gaia _ mission .",
    "the broad passbands implemented in the astro instrument should fulfil the chromaticity requirements from the astrometric data processing while at the same time allowing for the astrophysical characterization of stars in very crowded regions .",
    "the main classification and astrophysical parametrization task is carried out with the medium passbands implemented in the spectro instrument .",
    "the novel development we introduce in this work is the use of an objective ` figure of merit ' ( fom ) to compare different proposals for the _ gaia _ photometric system .",
    "this fom is based on the predicted errors that can be obtained for the parametrization of stars in terms of @xmath58 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath59}$ ] , and @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "these errors are calculated by using synthetic spectra to evaluate the sensitivity of each photometric passband to the astrophysical parameters . at the same time",
    "the degree of local degeneracy in the astrophysical parameters is taken into account in the fom .",
    "the overall fom for a photometric system is calculated taking into account the priorities of the different scientific targets that were deemed to be most important for addressing the core science case for _ gaia_. using the fom allows us to choose objectively which of the many proposed photometric systems is best in terms of reaching the astrophysical parameters error goals while at the same time having the least number of local degeneracies .",
    "the calculation of the predicted posterior errors and the fom as outlined in appendix  [ ap : fom ] can be applied to any photometric system and can also be used to predict parametrization errors that can be achieved with spectra of stars .",
    "in addition our method can be extended to the optimization of systems that can be used for the study of high red - shift galaxies or quasars ( for example to derive photometric red - shifts ) , as long as the dependence of the relevant seds on parameters such as red - shift or star formation rate are known .",
    "the main contribution of this work is the photometric system itself .",
    "this system has been designed based on our astrophysical knowledge and experience with ground - based systems and resulted in five ( c1b ) and fourteen ( c1 m ) passbands implemented in the astro and spectro instruments , respectively .",
    "the number of passbands reflects the variety of targets ( all types of stars , qsos , galaxies , solar - system objects ) , the required stellar astrophysical parameters ( @xmath58 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath59}$ ] , @xmath64 $ ] ) and the need of breaking degeneracies ( changes in two or more parameters may translate to the same changes in some spectral features but different changes in other ones ) . in summary , three of the broad c1b passbands are located to the left of h@xmath108 line , on the h@xmath9 line and to the right of paschen jump .",
    "the other two passbands fill the gaps so that full coverage of the whole spectral range of _ gaia _ observations is provided .",
    "a broad passband in c1 m , implemented in the spectro instrument , provides the measurement of the uv flux at wavelengths blueward of the balmer jump .",
    "seven medium passbands are placed on the crowding of balmer series in early - type stars , on the caii h line , on mg i triplet and mgh band , on the h@xmath9 line , on one of tio absorption bands in cool stars , and on the strong cn band in r- and n - type stars .",
    "an additional passband serves to measure the flux in the wavelength range covered by rvs . finally",
    ", five passbands are devoted to the measurement of the pseudo - continuum .",
    "the unfiltered light measured in the astro and spectro instruments provides photometric data in two very broad passbands ( from 400 to 1000  nm and from 350 to 1025  nm ) .",
    "the @xmath32 magnitude from astro yields the highest snr among all _ gaia _ magnitudes , and hence is the most suitable for variability analysis .",
    "end - of - mission magnitude precisions have been estimated following an ` aperture photometry ' approach .",
    "a precision of @xmath109  mag is obtained at @xmath110 and @xmath111 for the c1b and c1 m passbands , respectively . in the case of the @xmath32 passband and for stars brighter",
    "than @xmath11216 and @xmath3414 measured with c1b and c1 m , the photometric precision is limited by how accurately the data are calibrated .",
    "although there is no detailed calibration model , a rough estimation of the number of involved calibration parameters and the number of available stars for calibration purposes shows that sub - millimagnitude photometric precisions are potentially achievable .",
    "a psf - fitting approach shows that it is possible to deal with stellar densities up to about 24@xmath3010@xmath113 stars / sq  deg to magnitude 20 with spectro , if accurate positional information from astrometry is used .    the performance of the _ gaia _ photometric system with respect to the determination of astrophysical parameters for single stars has been evaluated using the ` posterior ' errors from the fom formalism and using algorithms designed for the astrophysical parametrization of stars ( based on mdm and nn ) .",
    "the differences and limitations have been discussed .",
    "both approaches demonstrate that precision goals in section  [ sec : test_pop ] are generally achieved to @xmath1141718  mag and that the precision for each parameter depends on temperature , luminosity , chemical composition and interstellar extinction , and apparent magnitude , as expected .",
    "reasonable uncertainties of 0.51  dex are obtained even for the chemical composition of metal - poor stars ( @xmath59}$]@xmath115 ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath64 $ ] to a precision of about 0.10.2  dex is possible down to @xmath32@xmath341617 for low to intermediate temperature stars . assuming a standard extinction law , the c1b and c1 m passbands allow the determination of individual extinctions and hence the determination of @xmath58 is reliable , even in the presence of significant extinction , down to at least @xmath116 . by combining photometry and astrometry ,",
    "a statistical approach to the construction of a 3d galactic extinction map is also possible .",
    "_ gaia _ will yield parallaxes with relative uncertainties lower than 10% for some 100200  million stars allowing absolute magnitude determinations across the entire hr - diagram if the extinction is known .",
    "the c1b+c1 m system is designed to provide the same luminosity errors ( 0.10.2  dex in @xmath60 ) for giants and early type stars at large distances ensuring the study of the galactic structure on large scales .",
    "individual ages of stars at the turn - off of the halo and old - thin and thick disk at distances up to about 2 , 3 and 5 kpc in the galactic centre , anti - centre and orthogonal directions , respectively , can be determined with a precision of about 45  gyr .",
    "the same precisions can be obtained for early - agb stars , thus allowing the probing of larger distances than with turn - off and subgiant stars . for subgiants ,",
    "our estimations yield slightly lower uncertainties of 34  gyr .",
    "note that we quote uncertainties for individual ages . for a group of stars the mean age will be determined to much better precision .",
    "an additional merit of the _ gaia _ photometric system is its ability to discriminate qsos from stars and white dwarfs .",
    "this will results in a sufficient number of objects for the definition of the non - rotating extragalactic reference system for proper motions .",
    "finally , the performance of the c1b passbands when dealing with the chromaticity residuals has been evaluated .",
    "our estimates show that the chromatic contribution to the parallax errors is 0.141.4  microarcsec .",
    "as these numbers are based on a worst - case assumption for the wfe and a somewhat simplistic calibration model , a residual contribution of 1  microarcsec for stars and of few microarcsec for the qsos is likely achievable .    in summary ,",
    "the photometric system c1b+c1 m developed by the photometry working group satisfies the mission requirements and was therefore adopted as the baseline by the _ gaia _ science team .",
    "it has since been adopted by the esa project team as the basis for the formal mission requirements to the industrial teams participating in esa s invitation to tender for _",
    "gaia_.    the experience from the development of the photometric system , including selecting the scientific targets and the ` figure of merit ' approach , puts us in a good position to rapidly optimize new payload proposals that will come from the selected industrial contractor in the course of 2006 .",

    "the definition and the procedure for calculating a figure of merit for a photometric system was proposed by @xcite and we provide the details here .",
    "the achievable errors @xmath117 for a particular st @xmath118 can be calculated using the so - called sensitivity matrix @xmath119 .",
    "the elements of this matrix are the partial derivatives @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the ( noise - free ) normalized flux in filter @xmath122 ( in photon counts ) for st @xmath118 , and @xmath123 stands for the astrophysical parameter @xmath124 .",
    "these derivatives describe how the flux in each filter changes in response to a change in astrophysical parameter ( ap ) @xmath124 .",
    "consider the ap determination as a linearized least squares estimation of @xmath125 , the improvement of the ap vector .",
    "the observation equation for st @xmath118 resulting from the flux measured in filter @xmath122 reads : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the difference between the observed and predicted flux and @xmath128 indicates the flux uncertainty .",
    "observation equations of unit weight are formed through division by @xmath128 , whereupon normal equations are formed in the usual manner .",
    "the linearization is assumed to be made around the true parameter vector @xmath129 , so that the resulting update @xmath125 has zero expectation .",
    "then , given the variance - covariance matrix @xmath130 of the observed fluxes , the variance - covariance matrix of the estimated ap - vector @xmath131 is given by the inverse of the normal equations matrix : @xmath132 where the matrices @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 are defined for each st @xmath118 separately .",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath136_{kk}={\\ensuremath{\\sigma_{ik,\\mathrm{post}}}}$ ] of this matrix are the sought after achievable errors for a ps . in reality",
    "degeneracy among the aps will often make the matrix @xmath137 singular or near - singular , resulting in infinite or very large @xmath117 as computed from equation ( [ eq : cpostnob ] ) .",
    "this can be avoided by adding a suitable positive definite matrix @xmath138 which makes the whole right - hand side positive definite ; thus : @xmath139 @xmath138  is the _ a priori _ information matrix of the aps . in the absence of any other information on the aps we have @xmath140 .",
    "this matrix plays an important role and can be used to incorporate prior information on the astrophysical parameters .",
    "this matrix can also be used to incorporate constraining information from the parallax measurements . when the photometric data does not provide any relevant information on a given ap @xmath123 ( either because the flux variances in @xmath141 are too large or because the elements of the sensitivity matrix @xmath142 are too small )",
    ", then @xmath143 .",
    "in practice the derivatives @xmath120 are calculated numerically from simulated photometric data .",
    "the calculation thereof requires ( synthetic ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the sts and a noise model for the photometric instruments .",
    "the figure of merit is now calculated as follows . for each st @xmath118 and astrophysical parameter @xmath124 ( @xmath61 , @xmath59}$ ] , @xmath60 , @xmath58 , @xmath64",
    "$ ] ,  ) the performance of the photometric system is measured by the ratio @xmath144 .",
    "the figure of merit @xmath145 for each st @xmath118 is then defined as : @xmath146 where @xmath147 indicates the relative weight of each astrophysical parameter ( with @xmath148 ) and @xmath149 is a non - linear function of @xmath150 with a break around 1 .",
    "the function used is : @xmath151 the global figure of merit ( summed over all sts ) is the weighted and normalized sum : @xmath152 where the weights @xmath153 indicate the priority of each st @xmath118 .",
    "the value of @xmath154  indicates how close the performance of a photometric system is to being ` ideal ' ( when @xmath155 ) .",
    "this global figure of merit is then calculated for each photometric system using the error goals , weights and priorities defined in @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath156 in the function @xmath149 from equation ( [ eq : fx ] ) determines how much weight good performance ( @xmath157 ) gets in the fom as opposed to bad performance ( @xmath158 ) .",
    "we are looking for a ps that achieves the error goals over all of ap space and we want to avoid giving a high rank to a system that is extremely good in only one corner of ap space but very bad everywhere else .",
    "the latter will be highly ranked for @xmath159 but not for large @xmath156 .",
    "however , for very large @xmath156 ( for which @xmath149 approaches a step function with @xmath160 for @xmath158 ) we will not be able to tell the difference between two pss that are equally bad wherever @xmath161 but with one ps being better than the other when @xmath162 .",
    "we chose the value of @xmath163 as a good compromise between these two extremes .",
    "we end with a few remarks about the sensitivity matrix .",
    "the columns of @xmath119 are the gradient vectors that describe the changes of the fluxes with respect to a change in an ap .",
    "thus @xmath119 contains all the information needed to characterize the behaviour of the photometric system in the data space ( or filter flux space ) near st @xmath118 .",
    "in the ideal case the gradient vectors would be aligned with the coordinate axes of the data space . that is each flux measurement @xmath121 is sensitive to one ( and only one ) ap . in practice",
    "the gradient vectors are of course not aligned with the coordinate axes which means that each ap influences some linear combination of fluxes .",
    "this also means that even if all the gradient vectors are orthogonal the errors in the aps will still be correlated because any error on a measured flux @xmath121 will influence multiple ap determinations .",
    "these correlations are correctly taken into account in the calculation of the variance - covariance matrix of the estimated ap - vector and are reflected in non - zero off - diagonal elements in this matrix .",
    "a further complication that will occur in practice is that the gradient vectors will not be orthogonal to each other .",
    "this means that there will be degeneracies between the aps when we try to estimate them .",
    "a well - know example is the degeneracy between @xmath58 and @xmath61 if only the continuum of the spectrum is measured .",
    "the behaviour of the ps depends on the noise and we should in fact consider the noise - weighted gradient vectors which have components @xmath164 .",
    "when the orthogonality is defined with respect to the noise - weighted gradient vectors , non - orthogonal gradient vectors will lead to larger correlations between the errors in the estimated aps _ and _ they will also cause the standard errors on each ap to increase . without going into the mathematical details",
    "this can be appreciated if one considers that any degeneracy between two aps will make it more difficult to attribute flux changes to either of them thus increasing the uncertainty in both parameters .",
    "this means that a ps that contains larger degeneracies will get a lower figure of merit because of the increased @xmath117 for degenerate aps .",
    "note , however , that the fom used in this sense is a measure of how good a particular ps is at _ locally _ separating stars with different aps along orthogonal directions .",
    "the fom does not take _ global _ degeneracies into account , where very different parts of ap space are mapped onto each other in filter flux space ."
