    "metal absorption lines are one of our most versatile tools for studying the high - redshift universe . just as the ionization history of the igm reflects the output of ionizing photons from star - forming galaxies and quasars , the metal content of the igm",

    ", metal absorption lines can serve as sign posts to the `` typical '' galaxies that may be responsible for reionizing the universe at @xmath8 . perhaps most intriguingly",
    ", metal lines can also serve as a probe of the reionization process itself .",
    "a considerable amount of work on the high - redshift universe has focused on cosmic reionization , yet the timing and mechanisms by which the igm becomes permanently ionized remain poorly understood .",
    "the three main observational constraints on reionization are ( 1 ) the electron optical depth measured from the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , ( 2 ) the evolution of the high - redshift ly@xmath9  forest , and ( 3 ) the luminosity functions of high - redshift ly@xmath9-emitting galaxies ( laes ) .",
    "five - year _ wmap _ measurements of the cmb are consistent with an instantaneous reionization at @xmath10 , but are also compatible with an extended reionization process @xcite .",

    "* ) , making it extremely challenging to measure the ionization state of the igm at these redshifts directly from the ly@xmath9  forest .",
    "finally , the lack of a sharp decline in the luminosity function of laes from @xmath13 to @xmath14 suggests that most of the volume of the igm is already highly ionized by @xmath15 .",

    "quasar metal absorption lines provide a complimentary tool for studying the ionization state of the igm . in a reionization scenario where galaxies provide most of the ionizing flux",
    ", overdense regions of the igm should be the first to become enriched , yet may remain significantly neutral until the end of reionization due to the short recombination times at high densities .",
    "`` forests '' of low - ionization absorption lines such as o  i  @xmath16 , si  ii  @xmath17 , and c  ii  @xmath18 may therefore be present prior to the completion of reionization @xcite .",
    "our recent search for o  i  using hires spectra of @xmath19 qsos yielded mixed results @xcite . while an overdensity of low - ionization absorbers at @xmath1 was found along at least one sightline , sdss  j1148@xmath205251 ( @xmath21 ) , no enhancement was seen towards sdss  j1030@xmath200524 ( @xmath22 ) , which has a complete gunn - peterson trough spanning @xmath23  comoving mpc @xcite .",
    "these differences suggest there may be large - scale variations in the enrichment and/or ionization state of the igm at @xmath1 , and perhaps a strong redshift evolution in the ionization state of metal absorption systems .",
    "the metal - enriched , low - ionization regions towards sdss  j1148@xmath205251 may represent the final stages of reionization .",
    "alternatively , they may arise by chance from multiple pockets of enriched gas near galaxies aligned along a filament .    in order to effectively use metal lines as probes of reionization",
    ", the roles of enrichment and ionization must be separately understood .",

    ", we compiled a low noise dark frame by taking a large set of dark exposures with the same exposure time as our science frames .",
    "this was used to remove dark current features and other blemishes prior to sky subtraction .",

    "the fringe pattern was modeled and removed from the two dimensional flats .",

    "the residual bias level from each of the thirty - two independent readout channels was modeled and removed both at the start of the reduction and again after a first - pass sky subtraction .",
    "similar care was taken to remove the residual bias in the dark frames .    in order to maximize the signal - to - noise ratios of the final spectra",
    ", we performed simultaneous multiple spectral extraction on all exposures for a given object .",
    "the object spatial profile was modeled independently for each exposure . a response function derived from a standard star exposure was also applied to the counts in the 2-d frames .",
    "a single 1-d spectrum was then extracted from all exposures of a given object simultaneously using optimal weighting @xcite .",
    "this technique allowed us to best reject spurious pixels while preserving as much information as possible from the 2-d arrays , which were individually very noisy even after careful reduction .",
    "the 1-d spectra were then normalized using a slowly - varying spline fit to the continuum .",
    "telluric absorption correction was done using a model of the atmospheric transmission in the y band @xcite .",
    "this produced better results than using our standard star spectra , which contained some residual high - frequency ringing as a result of the fringing .",
    "even so , we have restricted our analysis to the center of the transmission window ( @xmath42   ) , where there is very little atmospheric absorption . finally , we scaled the formal error arrays so that the distribution of deviations of the flux from the continuum fit , normalized by the error array , was well fit by a gaussian with unit variance for each object . the typical resulting increase in the error array was @xmath43 , which is a reasonable estimate for the amount of noise that could not be well characterized in the 2-d frames .",
    "representative sections of the final spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : example_sections ] .",
    "the data tend to become noisy at the ends of the echelle orders , which are marked by a step in the error array .",

    "narrow metal lines can clearly be seen , though these are at much lower redshifts .",
    "significantly , the noise properties of the data are well - behaved , with a scatter as a function of wavelength that is well - described by the scaled error array .",
    "this is essential for correctly estimating our sensitivity .",
    "we have also acquired high - resolution optical spectra of @xmath1 qsos . some of these data were presented in @xcite , and the new observations will be discussed more thoroughly in the next paper . here we will use keck hires @xcite spectra of sdss  j0836@xmath200524 and sdss  j1030@xmath200524 ( @xmath46 ) to help evaluate candidate c  iv  detections along those sightlines .",
    "the data were reduced using a custom idl pipeline featuring optimal sky subtraction . as with the nirspec data ,",
    "simultaneous optimal extraction was also used to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio of the final spectra .",
    "prior to extraction , the 2-d counts were flux calibrated using a response function generated from a standard star .",
    "telluric absorption correction using a standard star was also applied to the 2d frames .",
    "velocity offsets between the standard and the science frames , as well as variations in the strength of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 absorption bands were determined from preliminary extractions of groups of individual exposures taken near the same time .",
    "since sdss  j1030@xmath200524 was observed on multiple runs at different times of the year , shifts in the relative velocity of the object allowed residuals from atmospheric absorption and emission to be especially well rejected .",
    "we searched for c  iv  doublets in our nirspec data both by eye and using an automated technique described below . although the spectra were corrected for telluric absorption , we limited our search to the regions between 9820    and 10920    ( @xmath49 ) , which is largely free of atmospheric absorption .",
    "the total redshift interval along each sightline is given in table  [ tab : ne_obs ] . in cases where the qso c  iv  emission line fell in the bandpass ,",
    "we included the entire region blueward of the line center .",
    "while it is customary to exclude a narrow region near the qso redshift in order to avoid proximity effects , this region is also typically enhanced with c  iv  absorbers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our conclusions below are therefore most likely enhanced by including it in our analysis . in any case , the proximity region comprises only a small part ( @xmath50% ) of the total path length towards two of our four qsos .",
    "both the manual search and the follow - up automated search revealed only a single candidate c  iv  absorber , which is at @xmath51 towards sdss  j0836@xmath200054 .",
    "this system is plotted in figure  [ fig : civ_z5.409 ] .",
    "voigt profile fitting produced a best - fit column density @xmath52 and a doppler parameter @xmath53  km  s@xmath33(i.e . , unresolved ) .",
    "using the hires spectrum of sdss  j0836@xmath200054 , we can measure si  iv  and h  i  ly@xmath9  and ly@xmath54  at the same redshift .",
    "there is no detectable si  iv , although this does not necessarily rule out a legitimate c  iv  absorber .",
    "more significantly , the hires data show transmission in ly@xmath9  and ly@xmath54  at this redshift . since c  iv  absorbers of this column density are almost always accompanied by saturated ly@xmath9  absorption , at least at lower redshifts ( e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see schaye et al .  2007 ) , we can safely conclude that this system is not real .",
    "thus , both our manual and automated searches produced no c  iv  detections .      to assess the significance of our lack of c  iv  detections we have estimated our completeness as a function of column density using a monte carlo method .",
    "artificial c  iv  doublets were inserted randomly into the data and an automated algorithm was used to determine whether these systems could be detected .",
    "we generated @xmath55 doublets for each sightline , ranging in column density from @xmath56 to @xmath57 .",
    "doppler parameters were selected from the measured distribution of @xcite .    in order to be considered a detection , we first required the flux decrement to exceed the local error at the wavelength of both lines of the doublet after the spectra were smoothed by the instrumental resolution ( @xmath58  km  s@xmath33 ) .",
    "we then fit independent gaussians to each line ( using the unsmoothed data ) , and evaluated the reliability of the fits and the agreement between the two lines .",
    "our tolerances were stricter for the stronger @xmath59 transition .",
    "for a satisfactory fit , the absolute velocity uncertainty was required to be less than 0.5 ( 1.0 ) times the resolution for the @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) transition .",
    "we further required that the fitted flux decrement be greater than 3.0 ( 2.0 ) times the fit uncertainty , and the line width be greater than both 3.0 ( 1.0 ) times the fit uncertainty and 0.5 times the resolution .",
    "a `` detection '' was only counted when the line fits were also consistent with being a doublet . in order to exclude potential false positives",
    ", we set stricter requirements for weaker lines , since strong lines are typically easy to identify by eye .",
    "when the peak optical depth of the @xmath59 transition was less ( greater ) than 1.0 , we required that the velocity offset between the two fits be less than both 1.0 ( 2.0 ) times the resolution and 2.0 ( 3.0 ) time the combined uncertainty in the fitted velocities .",
    "the line widths were required to agree to within half the width of the narrower line , or three times the combined uncertainty . in all cases , however , the line widths could not disagree by more than a factor of two . finally , if the peak optical depth of one or both lines was less than one , we required the ratio of the optical depths @xmath61 to be between 0.8 and 3.0 .",
    "defining criteria for an automated search is a somewhat subjective process , as selection thresholds and goodness - of - fit requirements will vary depending on the line fitting method .",
    "the above procedure was designed to give the same result as a visual evaluation of the synthetic lines as often as possible .",
    "in general , this meant applying greater scrutiny to weaker systems in order to avoid false positives .",
    "we found very good agreement overall between the fraction of systems identified by eye and by the automated method .",
    "our completeness results are shown in figure  [ fig : civ_completeness ] .",
    "we are most complete at @xmath62 , though we are still 50% complete in the overall sample at @xmath2 , and even retain some sensitivity at @xmath63 .",
    "as discussed below , the fact that we are significantly complete over a wide range of column densities allows us to put strong constraints on the column density distribution of c  iv  absorbers .",
    "we also evaluated the number of false positive detections we should expect . using the same automated search method , we searched the data for `` fake '' doublets with velocity separations that were offset from the c  iv  doublet separation . in each trial we adjusted the doublet separation by twice the instrumental resolution , omitting separations that were similar to true doublets such as mg  ii  @xmath64 , or other plausible combinations of intervening absorption lines . in twenty trials we detected seven false doublets , which gives an expectation value of 0.35 for the entire data set",
    "this is consistent with the single false c  iv  detection described above , although in that case we were able to rule it out based on the presence of transmitted flux in the ly@xmath9  forest .",
    "we can use our completeness estimates to calculate the number of detections we should expect if the column density distribution has not evolved from lower redshifts .",
    "it is conventional to fit a power law of the form @xmath66 here , @xmath67 is the absorption path length interval , defined such that , for a non - evolving population of sources , @xmath68 remains constant with redshift . for @xmath69 , @xmath70 fitting a large sample of absorbers at @xmath71 , @xcite found a slope @xmath72 for systems with @xmath73 , with a normalization @xmath74 ( corrected for our adopted cosmology ) at @xmath75 .",
    "indeed , they found that this distribution is nearly invariant out to at least @xmath76 .",
    "@xcite found a slightly shallower slope ( @xmath77 ) and a higher normalization when fitting the distribution of `` pseudoclouds '' identified by an automated method .",
    "we will compare our results to the @xcite fit , however , since the search method is more similar to the one used here .",
    "figure  [ fig : civ_expected ] shows our mean completeness function convolved with the column density distribution of @xcite .",
    "we would expect the largest number of detections near @xmath78 , but there are significant tails towards both ends of the column density range . in total , we would expect to detect 13.2 systems with @xmath79 between 13.0 and 15.0 along all four sightlines if @xmath80  was unchanged from @xmath65 . for zero detections ,",
    "the 95% and 99% 1-sided confidence limits on the mean expected number are 3.0 and 4.6 , respectively ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this translates into a 95% confidence limit of at least a factor of 4.4 decline in the number density of c  iv  systems from @xmath65 to @xmath0 , or a 99% limit of a factor of 2.9 .",
    "we note that with the @xcite @xmath80  we would have expected 21 systems .",
    "similarly , using @xmath80  from a fit to the c  iv  distribution in nine high - quality hires spectra from @xcite , we would have expected 17 lines .",
    "adopting the @xcite column density distribution may therefore be somewhat conservative .      given the large drop in the number density of absorbers we observe , it is worth reviewing the results from the initial searches for c  iv  at @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite obtained gemini / gnirs spectra of two @xmath28 qsos , sdss  j1306@xmath200356 ( @xmath81 ) and sdss  j1030@xmath200524 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "@xcite also observed sdss  j1030 + 0524 with vlt / isaac .",

    "they found at least one secure absorber , which occurs towards sdss  j1030@xmath200524 at @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "ryan - weber et al . also detected this system , albeit marginally ( they measure a much higher column density , but this may be due to blending of the @xmath60 transition with an unrelated line that is visible in the gnirs spectrum ) .",
    "they further detect a system at @xmath85 that is unclear in the gnirs data .",
    "we have checked the authenticity of the @xmath85 system by searching for related lines in our hires spectrum of sdss  j1030@xmath200524 .",
    "the optical data , shown in figure  [ fig : siiv_z5.724 ] , show si  iv  absorption at the redshift of the candidate c  iv .",
    "we confirm the large ( @xmath86  km  s@xmath33 ) velocity width measured by @xcite . at hires resolution ,",
    "the si  iv  absorption is clearly asymmetric and best fit using multiple components ( see table  2 ) . assuming that the c  iv  absorption has the same kinematic structure and relative component strength as the si  iv , we were able to reproduce the ryan - weber et al .",
    "fit using a total c  iv  column density very similar to their measured @xmath87 .",

    "if @xmath9 remains unchanged from @xmath4 , however , then @xmath105  is limited to @xmath128 , or a factor of @xmath99 less than @xmath129 .",
    "separately , @xmath130 must be @xmath131 in light of the two detected systems towards sdss  j1030@xmath200524 .",
    "these limits are compared to measurements from the literature in figure  [ fig : civ_omega ] .",
    "we note that our limits on @xmath105  based on the allowed shape of the column density distribution are consistent with the results from a broader search for strong c  iv  systems along a larger number of @xmath1 sightlines ( ryan - weber et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "our primary goal in this paper has been to measure the evolution of c  iv  absorbers at @xmath5 .",
    "we have shown that the weak ( @xmath132 ) absorption systems that are ubiquitous at @xmath133 are less abundant by at least a factor of four at @xmath30 . at face value",
    ", this might suggest that the metal content of the igm is changing rapidly at these redshifts .",
    "several factors , however , must be considered when translating the observed incidence of c  iv  systems into a global igm metallicity .",
    "the number density of highly ionized metal absorption systems at a given redshift will depend not only on the mean metallicity of the igm , but also on the the spatial distribution of the metals and on the ionization state of the enriched gas .",
    "we will have more leverage to assess these factors in a subsequent paper , in which we examine the role of low - ionization metal absorption systems at @xmath1 ( becker et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "for now , however , we can offer some speculation based on the c  iv  results alone .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of the high - redshift c  iv  evolution is how rapidly it proceeds at @xmath134 .",
    "as noted above , both the integrated comoving mass density ( @xmath105 ) and the column density distribution ( @xmath80 ) remain nearly invariant over @xmath135 .",
    "our redshift coverage extends down to @xmath136 , which means that much of the buildup of c  iv , at least for the weaker systems , must happen over an interval @xmath137 , or @xmath138  myr . by comparison , neither the comoving star formation rate density nor",
    "the stellar mass density is likely to increase by more than a factor of three from @xmath139 to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently addressed the observed c  iv  evolution using numerical simulations of large scale structure , including various prescriptions for feedback from galactic winds .",
    "they find that a relatively constant @xmath105  and @xmath80  over @xmath140 can be produced by a steadily increasing igm metallicity offset with a declining c  iv / c ratio due to energy input from winds .",
    "significantly , they find that in order to produce enough systems at @xmath141 , the metals must largely be in place by @xmath142 . their best - fitting model ( vzw from * ?",
    "* ) uses momentum - driven winds whose strength is tuned to strike the best balance between metal enrichment and energy injection . convolving their @xmath80  from this model at @xmath143 with our completeness , and making a first order correction based on the fact that their @xmath105  declines by roughly a factor of two from @xmath144 to @xmath145 , we would expect to see @xmath146 c  iv  systems in our data .",
    "this is strongly excluded , which suggests that the mean metallicity , the spatial distribution of metals , and/or the ionization fraction of c  iv  at @xmath30 must be evolving more rapidly than in their simulations .",
    "an important feature of the @xcite results is that c  iv  traces increasingly smaller overdensities at higher redshifts ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the observed dropoff in c",
    "iv  may therefore indicate that most of the metals at @xmath30 are confined to overdensities greater than those where c  iv  is a sensitive tracer of metallicity ( @xmath147 at @xmath148 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicity gradient might have to be fairly steep in order to suddenly recover the observed number density of c  iv  systems at @xmath6 by shifting the c  iv  `` window '' to larger overdensities .",
    "if the metal - enriched regions are marginally self - shielded at @xmath30 , however , then a moderate increase in the uv background may be sufficient to produce a large increase in the number of c  iv  systems over a relatively small @xmath149 .",
    "a hardening of the uv background could also produce an increase in the c  iv / c ratio .",
    "@xcite have recently pointed out that absorption in the lyman series of he  ii  in the igm can substantially decrease the intensity of the uv background at energies near the ionization potential of c  iii  ( 3.5  ryd ) . if the volume filling fraction of he  ii  is significantly smaller at @xmath6 than at @xmath30 , as would be expected for an extended he  ii  reionization process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the shape of the uv background may be more favorable to c  iv  at @xmath150 than at @xmath30 .    given the strong c  iv  systems identified by @xcite and @xcite , it is especially surprising that we did not detect any weak systems .",
    "the two c  iv  systems towards sdss  j1030@xmath200524 are marginally consistent with a power - law column density distribution under the constraints provided by our data .",
    "for example , for our 95% upper limit on the normalization of @xmath80  for @xmath151 ( figure  [ fig : civ_plaw ] ) , there is a 6% chance that a single sightline spanning @xmath152 would contain at least two systems with @xmath153 . among the six sightlines included here and in the previous studies , however",
    ", there would be a 30% chance that at least one sightline would contain two or more strong systems .",
    "this increases to 63% for @xmath154 , but in either case the lack of detections along our four sightines would have been highly unlucky .",
    "it is intriguing , therefore , to consider the possibility that there may be large - scale enrichment and/or ionization fluctuations in the @xmath1 igm .    as noted by @xcite ,",
    "there is good evidence that strong c  iv  systems at lower redshifts are closely associated with actively star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "if weak c  iv  systems are absent from the @xmath1 igm because most of the metal - enriched gas is in a lower ionization state , then the rare strong c  iv  systems may point to regions near vigorously star - forming galaxies , where the metallicity and the local ionizing background are enhanced .",
    "there is tentative evidence that this is the case from a search for @xmath1 lyman break galaxies carried out by @xcite .",
    "they used hst / acs to search for @xmath155-dropouts in the fields of five @xmath1 qso .",
    "compared to the goods field , they find overdensities in only two fields , with the strongest overdensity towards sdss  j1030@xmath200524 ( first reported by * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath155-dropouts in that field appear spatially clustered , and their @xmath156 colors are consistent with star - forming galaxies at @xmath157 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the two strong c  iv  absorbers seen towards sdss  j1030@xmath200524 may be associated with outflows from uv - bright galaxies in a foreground filament .",
    "in contrast , an underdensity of @xmath155-dropouts is seen towards sdss  j1148@xmath205251 , whose sightlines does not contain any @xmath30 c  iv  absorbers .",
    "this sightline is known to contain multiple @xmath158 o  i  systems @xcite .",
    "the presence of metals in a low - ionization state , combined with the lack of uv - bright galaxies , suggests that this sightline was enriched at @xmath8 , but lacks a sufficient amount of ongoing star formation to keep the enriched gas highly ionized .",
    "we will return to this point in a subsequent paper .",
    "finally , we note that the sdss  j0836@xmath200054 field contains an overdensity of @xmath155-dropouts @xcite yet does not show any c  iv  or o  i  @xcite .",
    "if these galaxies are embedded in a protocluster surrounding the radio - loud qso , then hard uv photons from the qso itself may be over - ionizing any metal - enriched gas such that it does not appear as c  iv .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up of the @xmath155-dropouts in qso fields will help determine whether these scenarios are correct .",
    "we have presented a survey for c  iv  at @xmath5 towards four @xmath28 qsos using keck / nirspec in echelle mode .",
    "this is the most sensitive search for c  iv  at these redshifts to date , yet we find no c  iv  systems in any of our spectra . based on our completeness estimates and the column density distribution of @xcite , which remains largely invariant over @xmath159",
    ", we would have expected to detect roughly 13 systems in the range @xmath160 in the case of no evolution out to @xmath1 .",
    "our lack of detections implies that the number density of c  iv  absorbers to which our data are sensitive declines by at least a factor of @xmath161 ( 95% confidence ) from @xmath6 .",
    "our null result places strong constraints on the shape and normalization of the c  iv  column density distributions at @xmath162 . for a power - law distribution , @xmath163 , with a slope equal to that measured at @xmath164 ( @xmath165 )",
    ", the normalization must decline by at least a factor of 4.4 ( 95% ) .",
    "the distribution may also flatten or steepen , but only a narrow range of normalizations are allowed for each @xmath9 by our data and the fact that at least two strong ( @xmath88 ) systems are seen in the two previously studied sightlines ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and confirmed herein ) .",
    "our limits on @xmath105  are less strong due to the fact that the comoving density can be domiated by rare , strong systems . within the range @xmath3 ,",
    "however , the constraints on @xmath80  imply that @xmath105  must decline by at least a factor of two from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( see also ryan - weber et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath80  and @xmath105  are relatively constant at @xmath166 further means that most of the buildup of c  iv  in the igm must occur over an interval @xmath137 , or @xmath167  myr .",
    "the fact that c  iv  in the igm rapidly increases between @xmath7 and @xmath6 suggests that ionization effects may be playing an important role .",
    "that is , a significant fraction of intergalactic metals we see as c  iv  at @xmath6 may already be in place at @xmath168 , but in a lower ionization state .",
    "this may especially be true if the metals are confined to relatively high overdensities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but other factors may also be at work .",
    "an increase in the overall igm metallicity , a wider dispersal of metals by galactic winds , and an increase in the c  iv / c ratio due to an increase in the intensity or a hardening of the uv background would all help to explain the rapid increase in c  iv  at @xmath169 . to evaluate the relative importance of these effects ,",
    "it is critical to measure the abundance of metals in lower ionization states .",
    "we will do this in a subsequent work .",
    "the contrast between our lack of detections along four sightlines and the presence of two strong c  iv  absorbers towards sdss  j1030@xmath200524 suggests that there may be large - scale variations in igm enrichment and/or in the ionization state of the metal - enriched gas .",
    "we are currently planning follow - up observations of sdss  j1030@xmath200524 to look for weak c  iv  systems .",
    "the presence of additional c  iv  would more strongly indicate that this sightline is either more enriched or more highly ionized than those in our current sample .",
    "alternatively , the strong c  iv  systems may be associated with rare , uv - bright star - forming galaxies , in which case the enhancement of c  iv  would be a local effect .",
    "this is supported by the overabundance of @xmath155-dropouts in the field of sdss  j1030@xmath200524 @xcite , although spectroscopic follow - up is required to be certain that these galaxies are associate with the c  iv  systems .",
    "finally , we note that the decline of c  iv  at @xmath30 poses an interesting challenge to the use of low - ionization metal lines as tracers of reionization .",
    "if the number density of c  iv  systems had remained constant out to @xmath1 , then we would be more certain that the igm is sufficiently enriched at early times for metal lines to serve as meaningful probes of the ionization state of the gas .",
    "the disappearance of c  iv  at high redshifts , however , means that if an `` o  i  forest '' is not found at @xmath170 , the result could be attributed to a deficit of metals rather than to a highly - ionized igm . on the other hand",
    ", the detection of a significant number of neutral metal absorption systems at @xmath1 would have a double significance : that the igm is at least partially metal - enriched by that redshift , and that pockets of the igm were not permanently ionized until well after the early reionization epoch favored by cmb studies .",
    "this will be the focus of the following paper .",
