    "just three years after the prediction of the josephson effect  @xcite , maki and griffin  @xcite calculated the expression accounting for the electronic heat current flowing through a temperature - biased sis jj ( where s stands for superconductor and i for insulator )  @xcite : @xmath12 equation  [ jtot ] contains interesting information about the impact of the josephson effect on thermal transport .",
    "first of all , @xmath4 consists of two components : the former accounts for the heat carried by quasiparticles and represents an incoherent flow of energy from the hot to the cold reservoir  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath13 is the thermal counterpart of the `` quasiparticle - pair interference '' term that contributes also to the _ electrical _ current tunneling through a jj  @xcite .",
    "it stems from energy - carrying tunneling processes involving concomitant creation and destruction of cooper pairs on both sides of the junctions  @xcite and is therefore regulated by the phase difference @xmath0 between the two superconducting condensates . depending on @xmath0 ,",
    "this coherent component can flow in the opposite direction with respect to that imposed by the temperature gradient , although the total @xmath4 follows the second principle of thermodynamics .",
    "all these features have been investigated and confirmed experimentally in different interferometer - like structures , which are schematically depicted in fig .",
    "the first three devices have a similar structure : two normal metal electrodes n ( thin films made of copper or manganese - doped aluminum ) are used as electronic thermal reservoirs connected by a superconducting central part ( made of aluminum ) that forms the core of the interferometer .",
    "the reservoirs are also connected to superconducting wires that create sinis junctions , which can be used as joule heaters or thermometers ( not shown )  @xcite . by injecting a joule power",
    ", one can heat the electrons in the source up to a temperature @xmath14 , so as to elevate the quasiparticle temperature @xmath15 of the upper branch s@xmath16 of the interferometers above @xmath11 . on the contrary ,",
    "the lower branch s@xmath17 is thermally anchored to the bath temperature , thanks to its large volume . in this way , it is possible to obtain a substantial thermal gradient between s@xmath16 and s@xmath17 , thereby generating finite heat currents @xmath4 flowing through the jjs that form the central part of the structure . by applying an external magnetic flux",
    "@xmath18 one can tune the phase polarization of the jjs  @xcite and therefore manipulate @xmath13 , leading to coherent oscillations of the drain temperature @xmath19 .        figure  [ fig2]a displays the schematic of the thermal counterpart of a symmetric dc squid , which offered the first experimental proof of eq .",
    "[ jtot ] ( ref .  ) . by imposing a thermal gradient across the device and varying @xmath18 , the authors observed modulations of @xmath19 as large as 21 mk at @xmath20 mk , as shown in fig .",
    "these modulations stem from the interference between the coherent components of the heat currents flowing across the jjs of the squid , and can be fitted with a thermal model accounting for the predominant energy - exchange mechanisms present in the system ( see black line in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) .",
    "the model is based on the conservation of energy and imposes that in stationary conditions the sum of the incoming and outgoing thermal currents for each electrode of the structure must be equal to zero  @xcite .",
    "the excellent agreement between the experiment and the theory confirms the physical picture described above .",
    "the complementary demonstration of the coherent nature of @xmath13 was obtained one year later , with the observation of a thermal diffraction pattern in an extended rectangular jj  @xcite , as depicted in fig .",
    "the temperature - biased jj between s@xmath16 and s@xmath17 is threaded by a magnetic flux controlled by an in - plane magnetic field @xmath21 .",
    "this generates quantum diffraction for the heat current @xmath4 and produces an archetypal fraunhofer - like pattern [ @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the superconducting flux quantum ( ref .  ) ] for the electronic drain temperature , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d  @xcite . in analogy to what was done in the 60s for the electrical josephson current ,",
    "this experiment confirmed unequivocally the thermal current - phase relationship expressed by eq .",
    "[ jtot ] .",
    "although these interferometers embody the simplest structures to obtain the experimental demonstration of the prediction by maki and griffin , they are not ideal systems to achieve the full control of @xmath13 . indeed ,",
    "unwanted structural asymmetries ( for instance , a difference in the normal - state resistance of the jjs ) can reduce severely the visibility of the oscillations of a conventional single - loop squid  @xcite . to avoid this , one can replace one of the jjs with an additional squid , thereby realizing the josephson thermal modulator sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig2]e  @xcite , in which two magnetic fluxes @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be driven ( in principle ) independently .",
    "this device enables the generation of exotic thermal interference patterns , as the one displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2]f , which are characterized by large oscillation amplitudes , high sensitivities to magnetic flux variations , and a 99 % modulation of @xmath13 despite the presence of a non - negligible junction asymmetry .",
    "foremost , this system showed a perfect correspondence in the phase engineering of charge and thermal transport@xcite , opening the way for the conception of more sophisticated coherent caloritronic devices where thermal currents can be manipulated at will .",
    "in this perspective , the josephson modulator could be the core of a thermal splitter  @xcite , able to control the amount of energy transferred among several terminals residing at different temperatures . or even more interesting ,",
    "the magnetic fluxes threading the loops could be driven independently with the help of superconducting on - chip coils .",
    "this would allow to control separately the phase - biasing of the loops , with the possibility to perform closed cycles in the flux parameter space and to realize heat pumps  @xcite , microwave coolers  @xcite or time - dependent quantum engines  @xcite .",
    "the most recent achievement in mastering @xmath13 is represented by a @xmath26 phase - controllable thermal jj . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2]g , the latter is embedded in a `` pseudo '' radio frequency ( rf ) squid containing three jjs , two of which support a higher josephson critical current  @xcite .",
    "this configuration enables the phase - biasing of the s@xmath16is@xmath17 jj from 0 to @xmath27 , thereby allowing to minimize or maximize @xmath4 and to obtain unprecedented temperature modulation amplitudes ( @xmath28 mk at @xmath29 mk , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]h ) and sensitivities to the magnetic flux exceeding 1 k@xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the fully superconducting nature of the device allows to efficiently suppress the influence of the electron - phonon coupling , leading to a remarkably high maximum operational temperature of 800 mk . yet , as it will be clear from the next paragraphs , this structure realizes the fundamental requirement to obtain negative thermal differential conductance ( ndtc ) which is at the basis of non - linear thermal devices , such as tunnel heat diodes  @xcite , thermal switches and transistors  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3]a shows a possible design for a thermal transistor , in particular for a thermal modulator .",
    "the latter consists of a three - terminal device in which two n electrodes acting as source and gate are tunnel coupled to the s@xmath16is@xmath17 jj .",
    "now , it is worth noting that besides phase - coherence the heat current @xmath4 exhibits another important feature .",
    "figure  [ fig3]b shows the calculated behavior of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath15 for a set @xmath19 and @xmath31 [ being @xmath32 the temperature - dependent energy gaps of s@xmath16 and s@xmath17 , respectively  @xcite ] . when @xmath33 , the heat current presents a sharp peak for @xmath34 , which is due to the matching of the singularities in the superconducting densities of states  @xcite . at higher values of @xmath15",
    "we reach the condition in which @xmath35 and the thermal transport across the jj is reduced , giving rise to a region of ndtc .",
    "this effect is maximum for @xmath36 , while ndtc vanishes for @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "a realistic system able to detect ndtc is the thermal counterpart of a tunnel diode ( as the one envisioned in ref .  ) , which could also serve as a solid - state thermal memory device . here",
    ", we just show how ndtc in a thermal modulator can generate _ heat amplification _ :",
    "changes in the thermal current coming from the gate ( @xmath38 ) can induce a larger change in the currents flowing from the source to the drain .",
    "figure  [ fig3]c shows the predicted behavior of @xmath39 and @xmath40 when @xmath41 and @xmath42 is varied as a control knob .",
    "it is clear how in region i the device can significantly reduce both @xmath39 and @xmath43 while @xmath38 remains close to zero .",
    "a more quantitative analysis tells us that in this region the transistor works ideally , but thermal amplification is present also in region ii , which is several hundreds of mk wide  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it was shown that a thermal amplifier can also be designed by simply switching the position of the jj and the n source electrode  @xcite .",
    "the last structure we wish to present in this section is a hybrid thermal rectifier , a device that allows heat to flow preferentially in one direction . even though the system is not coherent",
    ", it proves the potential of superconducting hybrid circuits as the ideal platform to manipulate heat currents .",
    "the structure ( whose schematic is shown in fig .  [ fig3]d ) joins two theoretical proposal , and proves two different regimes of rectification .",
    "the first is based on the thermal symmetry breaking given by the temperature dependence of the superconducting energy gap in a simple nis junction  @xcite .",
    "the second and most efficient mechanism relies on the asymmetric release of energy from the device to the thermal bath thanks to n probe acting as a cooling fin  @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "the authors measured the output temperature of the structure @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the forward and reverse thermal bias configuration , respectively  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]e , a maximum @xmath46 exceeding 60 mk was observed at @xmath47 mk ( full circles , left axis ) .",
    "the analysis of the data provided a rectification ratio @xmath48 ( solid line , right axis ) , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the heat currents flowing at the output of the thermal diode in the two different temperature bias configurations .",
    "a significant maximum value of @xmath51 was obtained , which outscored previous experimental results by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "finally it is worthwhile to emphasize that this device can be easily modified and combined with the interferometers discussed above to realize phase - coherent thermal diodes  @xcite .",
    "due to the electron - phonon coupling in a proximity wire s inserted in a superconducting loop s. the electrode s can be tunnel coupled to other superconducting electrodes that can be used as joule heaters and thermometers ( not shown )  @xcite . *",
    "b. * calculated electronic temperature @xmath15 of the s electrode as a function of the magnetic flux @xmath18 threading the loop for different values of the normalized injected joule power @xmath52 ( for details , see ref .  ) at @xmath47 mk .",
    "the curves are obtained for @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the superconducting energy gap of s , @xmath55 is the thouless energy of the junction , @xmath56 is the diffusion coefficient of s and @xmath57 is the length of the junction . *",
    "c. * schematic representation of a proximity heat valve .",
    "the structure is similar to the one shown in panel a , but with a normal metal probe n connected to s by means of a tunnel junction . when s and s are heated up to the electronic temperature @xmath14 , the heat current @xmath58 flows across the tunnel junction sin and its amplitude depends on the magnetic flux @xmath18 . * d. * calculated electronic temperature @xmath15 of the n electrode vs. @xmath18 for different values of @xmath14 at @xmath59 mk .",
    "the s electrode is assumed to be made of aluminum [ @xmath60 ev ] and the ss s junction is assumed to be in the short limit [ @xmath61 .",
    "similar results can be obtained as well in the long junction regime  @xcite . in all panels we assumed @xmath62 .",
    "[ fig4 ] ]    as mentioned in the introduction , the second approach to coherent caloritronics is based on the superconducting proximity effect  @xcite . when a normal metal ( s ) is brought in contact with a superconductor , the superconducting order parameter leaks out to the normal side .",
    "the main consequences of this effect are the changes in the local density of states ( dos )  @xcite and the induction of a finite pair amplitude in the normal metal .",
    "for instance , in a ss s jj the proximity effect generates a phase - tunable minigap @xmath63 in the dos of the weak - link that has a maximum for @xmath37 and vanishes for @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "this offers the opportunity to manipulate in a continuous fashion the thermal properties of the s electrode , including its electronic entropy and specific heat  @xcite , which can be varied from those of a superconductor to those of a normal metal .",
    "even more interesting , also the relaxation mechanisms existing in s can be controlled by tuning the value of @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the presence of the energy gap in the density of states exponentially suppresses the electron - phonon coupling in a superconductor  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig4]a shows a possible configuration to detect the coherent modulation of the electron - phonon coupling in a s weak - link .",
    "the latter interrupts a superconducting loop s that is used to phase - polarize the jj by means of an external magnetic flux @xmath18  @xcite . when @xmath65 , @xmath64 is maximum and by heating s the heat current @xmath66 released by electrons to the phonon bath is minimized .",
    "thus , for these values of @xmath18 the s electronic temperature @xmath15 reaches a maximum , whereas it shows a minimum for semi - integer values of the flux quantum ( i.e. , for @xmath67 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the periodic modulations of @xmath15 can exhibit a remarkable maximum amplitude of several tens of mk at @xmath47 mk  @xcite , but it is possible to envision an even more efficient way to exploit the phase - dependence of @xmath64 .",
    "indeed , one can think of the superconducting energy gap as a barrier for energy - carrying quasiparticles .",
    "the possibility to tune coherently the height of this barrier leads promptly to the design of a valve for electronic heat currents  @xcite .",
    "the proposed structure is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig4]c , and consists of a superconducting quantum interference proximity transistor ( squipt )  @xcite , i.e. a superconducting loop s interrupted by a normal wire s , which is tunnel coupled to a normal metal probe n. if the electronic temperature of s and s is raised up to @xmath14 , we can obtain modulations of the n temperature @xmath15 with amplitudes exceeding 100 mk at @xmath68 mk .",
    "we stress that , although not yet experimentally proven , the approach described in this section has the potential to be extremely effective thanks to the ability to vary the thermal conductance of the sin junction by several orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to previous realizations of thermal andreev interferometers  @xcite and to the josephson circuits analyzed in the previous section .",
    "are coupled by an intermediate circuit consisting of two dc squids , connected by superconducting lines acting as ideal insulators for galvanic thermal transport .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath18 piercing the loops can vary the josephson inductance of the squids , thus regulating the electromagnetic coupling between the n electrodes , and modulating the photonic heat current @xmath69 . *",
    "b. * electronic temperature @xmath15 modulations as a function of @xmath18 for a parasitic injected power of @xmath70 fw and for different values of @xmath11 .",
    "data are taken from ref .  .",
    "* c. * sketch of a non - galvanic photon thermal transistor . in this case",
    ", the intermediate circuit is a dc squid _ inductively _ or _ capacitevily _ coupled to the n reservoirs .",
    "the temperature of the right reservoir @xmath71 can be controlled by the change of the josephson inductance when @xmath18 is varied .",
    "* d. * calculated magnetic interference pattern of @xmath71 for different values of @xmath14 at @xmath72 mk in the case of an inductive coupling . here , we set a mutual inductance of @xmath73 ph , the capacitance of the squid jjs of @xmath74 ff and the maximum josephson inductance of @xmath75 ph . in all the panels we assumed @xmath76 .",
    "[ fig5 ] ]    last approach to obtain coherent control of heat currents is through the transport of thermal photons , which becomes the dominant mechanism when the phononic channel is completely frozen  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig5]a shows the first experimental configuration that was used to detect and coherently control the photonic thermal transport between two n reservoirs with finite resistances @xmath77 and @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "when the electronic temperature of the left reservoir is raised up to @xmath79 , the electromagnetic noise power radiated from this resistor generates a net photonic power @xmath80 flowing towards the other reservoir residing at temperature @xmath71 ( with @xmath81 ) . since the dimensions of the circuit are typically much smaller than the photon thermal wavelength ( @xmath82 cm at temperatures below 1 k )  @xcite , it is possible to consider the structure as a lumped series of equivalent circuits  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this circuital approach is equivalent to the analysis employing nonequilibrium green s functions  @xcite .",
    "it can be demonstrated that @xmath80 is proportional to a frequency - dependent transfer function  @xcite : @xmath83 \\re [ z_2 ( \\omega)]}{|z_{\\rm tot}(\\omega)|^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath84 are the impedances of the n reservoirs , @xmath85 is the total series impedance of the circuit and @xmath86 is the impedance of the coupling circuit . in the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a , the coupling circuit consists of two dc squids connected to the n electrodes through superconducting lines , which act as ideal thermal insulators at low temperatures . the squids are equivalent to two lc circuits with a variable josephson inductance that depends on the magnetic flux @xmath18 piercing the loops .",
    "thus , also @xmath87 and @xmath80 become flux - dependent , allowing a coherent control of the photonic heat flux across the circuit .",
    "in this way , modulations of @xmath15 ( up to @xmath88 mk of amplitude ) as a function of @xmath18 have been observed up to @xmath89 mk , as shown in fig .",
    "this experiment was one of the first experimental demonstrations of coherent caloritronics , and proved that photonic heat conduction can reach the quantum limit when @xmath90 and @xmath91 is minimized  @xcite .",
    "one step beyond this experiment is based on the concept of a fully contactless photonic heat transistor  @xcite , schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig5]c . in this case , the n reservoirs are _ inductively _ or _ capacitively _ coupled to the intermediate circuit , which is based on a dc squid .",
    "the latter can be treated as a purely reactive lc circuit with a variable josephson inductance . by heating the left reservoir up to @xmath14 yields flux - dependent @xmath71 modulations in the other remote n electrode , as displayed by the calculated curves in fig .",
    "these theoretical curves have been obtained by assuming an inductive coupling with a mutual inductance of @xmath73 ph for different values of @xmath14 at @xmath72 mk and show remarkably large modulations up to 200 mk .",
    "similar results can be obtained via a capacitive coupling , which turns out to be even more efficient and accessible from the fabrication point of view  @xcite .",
    "the photonic method opens the way to the investigation and exploitation of non - galvanic thermal transport , which would lead to wireless electronic cooling and to the remote control of noise and decoherence in mesoscopic quantum circuits .",
    "moreover , the same system could also be the basis of photonic thermal rectifiers  @xcite .",
    "all the structures discussed above can be implemented by conventional nanofabrication techniques , i.e. , electron beam lithography , shadow mask evaporation of metals and _ in - situ _",
    "oxidation  @xcite .",
    "they would join the well - known systems used for heating , cooling and thermometry in mesoscopic superconducting circuits  @xcite , which now embody a unique playground for investigating phase - coherent heat transport at the nanoscale .",
    "furthermore , they might be easily combined with hybrid platforms based on , e.g. , semiconducting nanowires , graphene  @xcite , ferromagnets or ferromagnetic insulators  @xcite , topological insulators  @xcite or low dimensional electronic devices to enhance their functionalities .",
    "therefore , coherent caloritronics would certainly benefit all the fields of nanoscience requiring an accurate administration of heat , including solid - state cooling  @xcite , energy harvesting , thermal isolation , radiation detection  @xcite and quantum information  @xcite .",
    "the latter , in particular , might easily take advantage of many caloritronic devices in order to protect qubit architectures from decoherence  @xcite .",
    "the advent of heat transistors and thermal memories could also pave the way to a new field called thermal logic  @xcite , in which the information is transferred , processed and stored under the form of energy .",
    "finally , coherent caloritronics can shed light on several fundamental energy- and heat - related phenomena at the nanoscale , such as coherent dynamics , time - dependent effects , quantum thermodynamics , heat transport in topological states of matter  @xcite and give rise to phase - coherent thermoelectric effects in superconducting hybrid circuits  @xcite .",

    "<S> * the emerging field of coherent caloritronics ( from the latin word `` calor '' , i.e. , heat ) is based on the possibility to manipulate the phase - coherent heat currents flowing in mesoscopic superconducting structures . </S>",
    "<S> the goal is to design and implement quantum technologies able to master energy transfer with the same degree of accuracy reached for charge transport in contemporary electronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> this can be obtained by exploiting the macroscopic quantum coherence intrinsic to superconducting condensates , which manifests itself through the josephson and the proximity effect . here </S>",
    "<S> , we review recent experimental results obtained in the realization of heat interferometers and thermal rectifiers , and discuss a few proposals for exotic non - linear phase - coherent caloritronic devices , such as thermal transistors , solid - state memories , coherent heat splitters , microwave refrigerators , thermal engines and heat valves . besides being extremely attractive from the fundamental physics point of view </S>",
    "<S> , these systems are expected to have a vast impact on all cryogenic microcircuits requiring energy management , and ( possibly ) lay the first stone for the foundation of electronic thermal logic . *    in the last decades , the impressive evolution of modern electronics has reached a point where quantum effects and phase coherence are ordinarily exploited to investigate exotic phenomena at the nanoscale under controlled and adjustable conditions . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the potentialities offered by quantum nanotechnology have been scarcely employed in the study and control of heat currents ( the branch of science called `` caloritronics '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> most of the effort has been put into electronic and phononic thermometry or refrigeration  @xcite , and in the interaction between heat and spin currents in thermoelectric devices  @xcite . a few works  @xcite have shown that heat flow </S>",
    "<S> has a quantum limit - just as the electric current - and that this limit does not depend on the nature of heat carriers . nevertheless , </S>",
    "<S> until a few years ago , little was known about the role of phase coherence in thermal transport  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this topic was addressed by the birth of _ phase - coherent caloritronics _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a young field of nanoscience that takes advantage of the quantum nature of the superconducting condensate to phase - coherently manipulate electronic heat currents in solid - state mesoscopic circuits .        the physical picture at the basis of coherent caloritronics </S>",
    "<S> is represented schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental idea is to exploit a suitable physical effect that depends on the quantum phase @xmath0 to control the electronic heat flow ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) between two electronic thermal reservoirs residing at temperatures @xmath3 . towards this end , </S>",
    "<S> three main different approaches can be followed . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b , the first possibility consists in the coherent control of heat transported by electrons in a temperature - biased josephson tunnel junction ( jj ) , since the electronic thermal current @xmath4 flowing through the junction depends on the macroscopic phase difference between the superconducting electrodes s  @xcite .    the second approach ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig1]c ) relies on the coherent manipulation of the electronic thermal conductivity and the electron - phonon coupling in phase - engineered superconducting proximity systems . here </S>",
    "<S> , two normal metal ( n ) reservoirs are tunnel - coupled to an other normal layer ( s ) in which superconducting correlations are induced thanks to the proximity effect . </S>",
    "<S> the latter generates a phase - tunable density of states @xmath5  @xcite , which directly affects the thermal properties of s , leading to the coherent manipulation of the electronic heat currents exchanged with the reservoirs @xmath6 and with the lattice phonons @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> last approach is sketched in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]d and is based on the regulation of the energy exchanged between electrons and photons thanks to the coherent tuning of the coupling with the electromagnetic environment . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the previous cases , the reservoirs are ( in general ) _ not _ in galvanic contact and the photonic heat current @xmath8 is controlled by an intermediate coherent circuit [ for instance , a direct current superconducting quantum interference device ( dc squid ) ] inductively or capacitively coupled to the reservoirs  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the squid is characterized by a magnetic - flux - dependent impedance @xmath9 that can act as a _ contactless _ knob for @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> all the options listed above can be implemented in the framework of quasiequilibrium regime  @xcite : since the electron - phonon coupling in metals is strongly suppressed at temperatures below 1 k , one can inject a joule power in the structure , thereby driving the electronic system into a fermi distribution function characterized by a temperature @xmath10 that can be significantly different from that of the lattice phonons . in our case , </S>",
    "<S> the latter are fully thermalized with the substrate phonons residing at the bath temperature @xmath11 , thanks to the vanishing kapitza resistance between thin metallic films and the substrate  @xcite .    in the following sections </S>",
    "<S> , we shall analyze more deeply each different approach , reviewing the major experimental achievements and the existing proposals for novel caloritronic devices . </S>"
