    "the recent solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor ( kamland @xcite and chooz @xcite ) and accelerator ( k2k @xcite ) neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very robust evidence that neutrinos are massive particles and their mixing involves two large angles ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) and one small angle ( @xmath8 ) . how small @xmath0 is remains an open question , but a global analysis of the presently available neutrino oscillation data @xcite indicates that @xmath0 is most likely to lie in the range @xmath9",
    ". one important target of the future neutrino experiments is just to measure @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the smallness of @xmath0 requires a good theoretical reason , which might simultaneously account for the largeness of @xmath5 and @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 held , there should exist a kind of new flavor symmetry which forbids flavor mixing between the first and third lepton families .",
    "while such a new symmetry is unlikely to exist at or below the electroweak scale ( @xmath12 gev ) , it might show up at a superhigh scale ",
    "e.g. , the scale of grand unified theories ( @xmath13 gev ) . then a natural way to break this flavor symmetry and obtain @xmath14 in a specific model is to run relevant parameters of the model from @xmath3 to @xmath1 by making use of the renormalization group equations ( rges ) @xcite and taking account of the seesaw threshold effects @xcite , either in the standard model ( sm ) or in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . antusch _",
    "et al _ have recently presented two simple examples ( one with @xmath15 and @xmath2 at @xmath3 @xcite , and the other with @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath3 @xcite ) to radiatively generate @xmath6 and @xmath14 , but their primary interest is in @xmath5 and their results for @xmath0 are far below the best - fit values of @xmath0 obtained from the global analysis @xcite .",
    "although the low - scale output of @xmath0 is somehow adjustable by scanning the parameter space of a given model at the gut scale , we find that it is highly nontrivial to obtain @xmath18 from @xmath19 and fit all experimental data of neutrino oscillations in the meantime .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to examine whether an appreciable magnitude of @xmath0 can be radiatively generated , from @xmath3 to @xmath1 , through the seesaw thresholds .",
    "we shall consider four instructive patterns of the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) lepton mixing matrix @xmath20 at @xmath3 as typical examples : @xmath21 where @xmath22 with @xmath23 being a cp - violating phase in the standard parametrization of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "while patterns ( a ) and ( b ) with cp conservation ( i.e. , @xmath24 ) have been discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite , we shall show that @xmath23 can actually play an important role in the radiative generation of @xmath0 .",
    "patterns ( c ) @xcite and ( d ) @xcite are phenomenologically favored to account for current experimental data of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "we find that the rge running and seesaw threshold effects may allow us to obtain @xmath4 at low energies from both patterns ( c ) and ( d ) in the mssm .",
    "if @xmath25 is taken at @xmath3 , it will be possible to radiatively produce @xmath4 at @xmath1 both in the sm and in the mssm . as a by - product , the mass spectrum of three heavy majorana neutrinos and the cosmological baryon number asymmetry via leptogenesis",
    "are also calculated .",
    "let us make a simple modification of the sm by introducing three heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 ) and keeping the lagrangian of electroweak interactions invariant under @xmath28 gauge transformation . in this case ,",
    "the lagrangian relevant for lepton masses can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the left - handed lepton doublet ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 stand respectively for the right - handed charged lepton and majorana neutrino singlets ; and @xmath33 is the higgs - boson weak isodoublet ( with @xmath34 ) . if the mssm is taken into account , one may similarly write out the lagrangian relevant for lepton masses : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( with hypercharges @xmath38 ) are the mssm higgs doublets . to obtain the effective ( left - handed ) neutrino mass matrix",
    ", a common approach is to integrate @xmath39 out of the full theory .",
    "this corresponds to a replacement of the last two terms in @xmath40 or @xmath41 by a dimension-5 operator , whose coupling matrix takes the well - known seesaw form @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "however , the threshold effects in such a naive treatment have to be taken into account , because the mass eigenvalues of @xmath26 may have a strong hierarchy ( for example , @xmath43 ) .",
    "we take @xmath40 or @xmath41 for granted at the gut scale , where the yukawa interactions of quarks and higgs bosons with the coupling matrices @xmath44 ( up ) and @xmath45 ( down ) can similarly be written out . to evolve the lepton mixing parameters from @xmath3",
    "to @xmath1 in a generic seesaw model , to be close to the electroweak scale @xmath1 , just for the sake of simplicity",
    ". even if @xmath46 holds , the relevant rge running effects between these two scales are negligibly small for the physics under consideration .",
    "] one has to make use of a series of effective theories which are obtained by integrating out the heavy right - handed singlets @xmath26 step by step at their mass thresholds .",
    "the derivation of the one - loop rges and the method for dealing with the effective theories have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite in an elegant way . here",
    "we summarize a few essential steps to be taken in treating the seesaw threshold effects .",
    "\\(a ) we use the one - loop rges to run @xmath47 and @xmath39 from @xmath3 to the heaviest right - handed neutrino mass scale @xmath48 .",
    "a proper unitary transformation of the right - handed neutrino fields allows us to diagonalize @xmath39 at @xmath48  namely , @xmath49 .",
    "then @xmath47 is transformed into @xmath50 .",
    "the effective neutrino coupling matrix @xmath51 can be obtained by integrating out @xmath48 . in this case , we denote ) are somehow different from those of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the seesaw formula @xmath52 has been adopted . ] @xmath53 and get the tree - level matching relation @xmath54 , where all variables have been set to the scale @xmath55 .",
    "\\(b ) we further run @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath51 from @xmath48 down to the intermediate right - handed neutrino mass scale @xmath58 . because the rge running effect may spoil the diagonal feature of @xmath59 , a re - diagonalization of @xmath57 at @xmath58 should be done by means of a @xmath60 unitary transformation matrix @xmath61 . integrating out @xmath58 , we arrive at @xmath62 and the tree - level matching condition @xmath63 , where all variables have been set to the scale @xmath64 .",
    "\\(c ) we follow a similar way to run @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 from @xmath58 down to the lightest right - handed neutrino mass scale @xmath68 . as @xmath66 is actually a @xmath69 mass matrix",
    ", it does not need to be re - diagonalized at @xmath68 .",
    "integrating out @xmath68 , we obtain @xmath70 where @xmath71 holds , and all variables have been set to the scale @xmath72 .",
    "\\(d ) finally , we run @xmath73 from @xmath68 down to the electroweak scale @xmath1 .",
    "the one - loop rge governing the evolution of @xmath73 is given by @xcite @xmath74 \\ ; , %        ( 7)\\ ] ] where @xmath75 with @xmath76 being the renormalization scale .",
    "we have @xmath77 , @xmath78 in the sm and @xmath79 , @xmath80 in the mssm @xcite , where @xmath81 denote the gauge couplings , @xmath82 denotes the top - quark yukawa coupling , and @xmath83 denotes the higgs self - coupling in the sm . after spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking , we arrive at the fermion mass matrices @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 in the sm ; and @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the mssm , where @xmath92 gev stands for the vacuum expectation value of the neutral higgs field in the sm , and @xmath93 represents the ratio of two vacuum expectation values in the mssm .",
    "the lepton ( or quark ) flavor mixing matrix @xmath20 ( or @xmath94 ) arises from the mismatch between the diagonalizations of @xmath95 ( or @xmath44 ) and @xmath73 ( or @xmath45 ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "we arrange @xmath95 and @xmath44 to be diagonal , real and positive at @xmath3 ; i.e. , @xmath96 where @xmath97 in the sm , and @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the mssm . in this flavor basis ,",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath47 can generally be expressed as @xmath100 where @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are three real and positive dimensionless parameters characterizing the eigenvalues of @xmath47 ; and @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 are three @xmath107 unitary matrices .",
    "it is obvious that the complex phases of @xmath104 and @xmath105 can be re - arranged , such that the former contains a single irremovable cp - violating phase as @xmath94 does .",
    "furthermore , one may redefine the relevant right - handed fields of quarks and neutrinos to rotate away @xmath106 from @xmath45 and @xmath105 from @xmath47 .",
    "such a transformation of @xmath47 is equivalent to absorbing @xmath105 into the majorana mass matrix @xmath39 , which is not required to be diagonal at @xmath3 .",
    "once @xmath106 and @xmath105 are rejected , we are only left with seven unknown parameters in the above yukawa coupling matrices ( namely , three eigenvalues of @xmath47 and four mixing parameters of @xmath104 ) .    to fix the pattern of @xmath39 at @xmath3 , we extrapolate the effective neutrino coupling matrix @xmath73 and the lepton flavor mixing matrix @xmath20 up to the gut scale : @xmath108 where @xmath109 ( for @xmath27 ) denote the physical masses of three light neutrinos .",
    "then @xmath39 can be determined from the inverted seesaw formula @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath20 consists of three mixing angles and three cp - violating phases .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , here we only take account of the `` dirac - like '' phase of @xmath20 .",
    "then the unitary matrices @xmath94 , @xmath20 and @xmath104 may universally be parametrized as @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 . in the limit of @xmath2 ,",
    "the complex phase of @xmath20 actually serves as a `` majorana - like '' phase and may significantly affect the rge running behaviors of neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing angles @xcite .",
    "four typical patterns of @xmath20 , as already listed in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , will be taken in our following investigation .    to be specific , we only pay attention to the normal mass hierarchy of three light neutrinos ( i.e. , @xmath114 )",
    ". then we arrive at @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where @xmath117 and @xmath118 denote the mass - squared differences of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "since the low - scale values of @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 are all known , we just have a single unknown mass parameter ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "on the other hand , four parameters of @xmath94 are also known at low energies @xcite .",
    "given a special pattern of @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , only its cp - violating phase is not fixed . in short ,",
    "we are totally left with nine free parameters at @xmath3 : the lightest neutrino mass @xmath123 , three eigenvalues of @xmath47 , four mixing parameters of @xmath104 and the cp - violating phase of @xmath20 .",
    "we should also specify the value of the higgs mass @xmath124 in the sm and that of @xmath93 in the mssm when numerically solving the relevant rges .",
    "although @xmath103 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are arbitrary parameters , they are expected to be of or below @xmath125 .",
    "the unknown rotation and phase angles of @xmath104 and @xmath20 are allowed to take possible values in the range between @xmath126 and @xmath127 . as for those parameters",
    "whose sizes are known at low energies , one may properly adjust their initial values at @xmath3 and run the rges to reproduce their low - scale values within reasonable error bars .",
    "we are then able to fix the parameter space by fitting all relevant low - scale data .",
    "such a phenomenological approach will allow us to examine whether @xmath18 can be generated from @xmath128 for @xmath20 .",
    "naively , we speculate that an appreciable rge enhancement of @xmath0 may take place either between the scales @xmath3 and @xmath68 or between the scales @xmath68 and @xmath1 . in either case , the masses of three light neutrinos are required to be nearly degenerate . as the seesaw threshold effect can significantly affect the rge running behaviors in most cases",
    "@xcite , it is more likely that the dominant rge enhancement of @xmath0 occurs between @xmath3 and @xmath68 .",
    "we shall demonstrate this observation in our subsequent numerical calculations .",
    "we carry out a numerical analysis of the rge running and seesaw threshold effects by following the strategies outlined above and taking four typical patterns of @xmath20 at the gut scale .",
    "our results are summarized in table 1 and figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "some comments and discussions are in order .",
    "\\(1 ) we have carefully examined the sensitivity of @xmath129 to the value of every free parameter at @xmath3 .",
    "we find that the inputs of @xmath123 , @xmath103 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath0 of @xmath104 and @xmath117 appear to be very important in adjusting the output of @xmath132 at @xmath1 , while the other parameters mainly play a role in fine - tuning the results .",
    "in particular , the effects of @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath5 of @xmath104 , @xmath10 of @xmath104 and @xmath23 of @xmath104 are insignificant , because the dominant rge enhancement of @xmath132 takes place above the heaviest right - handed neutrino mass scale @xmath48 . hence we have simply fixed @xmath133 for @xmath104 at @xmath3 .",
    "note that the initial values of @xmath131 and @xmath0 of @xmath104 are important in specifying the running tendency of two neutrino mass - squared differences and three mixing angles of @xmath20 , and they have to be sufficiently large ( as shown in table 1 ) in order to generate an appreciable magnitude of @xmath132 at low energies . to be more explicit ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath130 strongly relies on @xmath131 in the fitting , while the enhancement of @xmath132 ( from zero at @xmath3 to a few degrees at @xmath1 ) requires a big input value for @xmath0 of @xmath104 ( @xmath134 , for example ) .",
    "it is also worth remarking that the parameter space obtained here should by no means be unique ; or rather , it mainly serves for illustration . to exhaustively explore the allowed ranges of all relevant parameters",
    "is a quite lengthy work and will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) restricting ourselves to the typical parameter space illustrated in table 1 , we find that it is difficult to produce @xmath135 at @xmath1 in the sm .",
    "our results yield @xmath136 for pattern ( a ) and @xmath137 for patterns ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) at low energies . in the mssm , however , a more strong rge enhancement of @xmath132 becomes possible .",
    "for example , we obtain @xmath136 for pattern ( b ) with @xmath138 and @xmath135 for patterns ( c ) and ( d ) with @xmath139 at the electroweak scale .",
    "we think that the numerical results in the supersymmetric case are encouraging for model building , because a new kind of flavor symmetry at @xmath3 might naturally lead to the bi - maximal mixing pattern ( b ) or the large - maximal mixing patterns ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the running behavior of @xmath130 deserves some more remarks . as already noticed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the evolution of @xmath130 from @xmath1 to @xmath3 ( or vice versa ) depends sensitively on how big its initial value is and whether three light neutrinos have a near mass degeneracy .",
    "figs . 1 and 2",
    "illustrate that @xmath140 can radiatively be obtained , either from @xmath141 in pattern ( a ) or from @xmath142 in patterns ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) . for pattern ( a ) or ( b )",
    ", the rge running of @xmath130 in the mssm is quite similar to that in the sm .",
    "the reason for this similarity is simply that the magnitudes of @xmath123 ( sm ) and @xmath123 ( mssm ) at @xmath1 are comparable ( @xmath143 ev ) and the value of @xmath93 in the mssm case is mild ( @xmath144 ) . when patterns ( c ) and ( d ) are concerned , however , the running behavior of @xmath130 in the mssm is more violent than that in the sm .",
    "the reason for such a remarkable difference is two - fold : first , @xmath145 ev and @xmath146 ev in the mssm case imply that the masses of three light neutrinos are nearly degenerate in the entire running course  this near mass degeneracy can significantly affect the behavior of @xmath130 @xcite ; second , the large value of @xmath93 ( @xmath147 ) plays an important role in enhancing the rge evolution of light neutrino masses and flavor mixing angles ( e.g. , @xmath148 @xcite ) .",
    "\\(4 ) we stress that @xmath135 at @xmath1 can be radiatively generated from @xmath149 at @xmath3 even in the sm , only if we go beyond the four simple patterns considered above .",
    "a key point is to assume @xmath130 to be large enough at the gut scale .",
    "such an example is presented in fig .",
    "3 , where @xmath150 ( sm ) versus @xmath151 ( mssm ) has been taken .",
    "one may see that the dominant rge suppression of @xmath130 occurs from @xmath3 to @xmath48 , and the dominant rge enhancement of @xmath132 takes place in the same region .",
    "why @xmath152 holds at @xmath3 is certainly a big question .",
    "putting aside this question , we remark that @xmath153 at low energies can in principle be produced from an arbitrary value of @xmath130 at the gut scale via the seesaw threshold effects .",
    "furthermore , the radiative generation of @xmath132 is highly sensitive to the initial condition of @xmath130 .",
    "we observe that the running of @xmath154 is rather stable , unlike @xmath130 and @xmath132 .",
    "note that the cp - violating phase @xmath131 is also stable against radiative corrections from @xmath3 to @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion is true for both the example under consideration and the four patterns discussed above .",
    "\\(5 ) a by - product of our analysis is the determination of three heavy right - handed neutrino masses , as shown in table 1 .",
    "we see that they have a clear normal hierarchy .",
    "it is then possible to calculate the cosmological baryon number asymmetry via leptogenesis @xcite . instead of describing the technical details of leptogenesis @xcite , we only give a brief summary of its essential points in the following .",
    "lepton number violation induced by the third term of @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) or of @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) allows decays of three heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath26 to happen : @xmath155 and @xmath156 , where @xmath157 in the sm or @xmath158 in the mssm . because each decay mode occurs at both tree and one - loop levels ( via the self - energy and vertex corrections ) , the interference between these two decay amplitudes may result in a cp - violating asymmetry @xmath159 between @xmath155 and its cp - conjugated process .",
    "if the interactions of @xmath160 are in thermal equilibrium when @xmath161 and @xmath162 decay , the asymmetries @xmath163 and @xmath164 can be erased before @xmath160 decays .",
    "then only the asymmetry @xmath165 produced by the out - of - equilibrium decay of @xmath160 survives .",
    "this cp - violating asymmetry may lead to a net lepton number asymmetry @xmath166 , and the latter is eventually converted into a net baryon number asymmetry @xmath167 via the nonperturbative sphaleron processes @xcite : @xmath168 in the sm or @xmath169 in the mssm .",
    "we follow these steps to evaluate @xmath167 for four patterns listed in table 1 .",
    "it turns out that only pattern ( b ) can yield an appreciable result , which lies in the generous range @xmath170 drawn from the recent wmap observational data @xcite .",
    "compared with pattern ( b ) , patterns ( a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) have relatively small values of @xmath68 ( @xmath171 gev ) and @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) .",
    "the outputs of @xmath167 in these three patterns are therefore suppressed and below the observational result . if the example shown in fig .",
    "3 is taken into account , we may obtain @xmath174 ( sm ) or @xmath175 ( mssm ) , which is compatible with the wmap data .    finally , it is worthwhile to point out that we have also taken a look at the `` democratic '' neutrino mixing pattern @xcite @xmath176 at the gut scale and examined the possibility to radiatively produce @xmath4 at the electroweak scale and to simultaneously fit all experimental data of neutrino oscillations .",
    "we find that it is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to obtain @xmath7 at low energies .",
    "the reason is simply that the initial value of @xmath10 ( @xmath177 ) is not close to @xmath178 and the rge evolution can not significantly change the magnitude of this mixing angle . therefore , we argue that radiative corrections might not be a very natural way to break the lepton flavor democracy .",
    "the latter could be explicitly broken in some other possible ways at or below the gut scale .",
    "we have conjectured that the lepton flavor mixing angle @xmath0 might be vanishing at the gut scale due to the existence of a kind of new flavor symmetry . starting from this point of view , we have examined whether an appreciable value of @xmath0 at low energies can be radiatively generated via the rge running and seesaw threshold effects .",
    "four simple but typical patterns of the lepton flavor mixing matrices have been considered as the initial conditions at @xmath3 .",
    "it is found that the dominant rge enhancement of @xmath0 takes place from @xmath3 to the heaviest right - handed neutrino mass scale .",
    "for two large - maximal mixing patterns , @xmath18 can be radiatively produced in the mssm .",
    "we have also demonstrated that it is possible to obtain @xmath4 at @xmath1 from @xmath2 at @xmath3 in the sm , if the initial value of @xmath5 is large enough . as a useful by - product , the mass spectrum of three heavy majorana neutrinos is determined and the cosmological baryon number asymmetry via leptogenesis is calculated .",
    "although the numerical examples presented in this paper are mainly for the purpose of illustration , they are quite suggestive for model building . of course , only the future neutrino experiments can tell us how small @xmath0 is .",
    "but we believe that the radiative generation of @xmath0 from high to low energies is an interesting theoretical approach towards understanding the smallness of @xmath0 , and it might indicate some useful hints about the underlying flavor symmetry which is associated with the dynamics of lepton flavor mixing and cp violation .",
