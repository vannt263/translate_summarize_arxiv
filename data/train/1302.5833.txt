    "the @xmath26 aqcm wave function , which has no imaginary part , is the same as the conventional brink - bloch wave function .",
    "we explain later that the aqcm wave function corresponds to the @xmath1-coupling shell model wave function when @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the improved aqcm approach can describe the subshell closure configuration .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction is intuitively interpreted as @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the position , the momentum , and the spin of the nucleon , respectively . if nucleons have the momentum components parallel ( anti - parallel ) to @xmath33 , the spin - orbit interaction acts attractively ( repulsively ) .",
    "an imaginary part of a gaussian wave packet means the momentum of nucleon : @xmath34.\\ ] ] therefore , the aqcm wave function has the momentum parallel or anti - parallel to @xmath33 by introducing this particular form ( @xmath35 ) of the imaginary part in eq .  .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 correspond to parallel and anti - parallel momenta , respectively . in actual calculation",

    "thus , the spin - orbit interaction also acts in these quasi-@xmath0 clusters as well as in the first one .",

    "these states are given by aqcm wave functions for different @xmath3 and @xmath4 values , and various three-@xmath0 cluster model wave functions .",
    "in these latter components , the aqcm assumption of a threefold rotational symmetry about the @xmath42-axis is abandoned to simulate a gas - like near - threshold component of the wave function .",

    "[ 12c_conv ] shows the three-@xmath0 cluster threshold energy which is @xmath165 mev in the present model . from the first to the tenth basis state , we superpose aqcm wave functions where the values of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are chosen randomly keeping a threefold rotational symmetry about the @xmath42-axis .",
    "the following forty basis states correspond to various three-@xmath0 cluster wave functions which are obtained by assigning the gaussian center positions of @xmath0 clusters randomly .",
    "these basis states have no spatial symmetry .",
    "figure  [ 12c_conv ] shows the convergence of the total energy for @xmath166 ( the solid line ) and @xmath167 ( the dashed line ) states depending on the number of basis states .",
    "we see that the random three-@xmath0 cluster component , which is inessential in the ground state of @xmath2c , lowers the energy of the first excited state by about 7 mev .",
    "hence , the gas - like component can not be neglected in the near - threshold @xmath167 state .",
    "because of that , the energy of @xmath167 state converges rather slowly and one needs at least fifty basis states to find the stable result .",
    "the energy of the @xmath124 state converges at @xmath168 mev , which is close to the experimental value @xmath169 mev .",

    "this result confirms the earlier finding ( see sect .",

    "[ hf ] ) , @xmath143 , the gcm value is slightly reduced due to the mixing of different basis states and breaking a threefold rotational symmetry about the @xmath42-axis . on the other hand , the near - threshold @xmath11 state has a very small expectation value of the one - body spin - orbit operator , @xmath172 , _",
    "it is an almost pure cluster structure .",
    "these results for @xmath166 and @xmath167 agree with the modern understanding of cluster structure formation in @xmath2c @xcite .",
    "a transition between the @xmath1-coupling shell model structure and the three-@xmath0 cluster structure occurs in the vicinity of the @xmath0- and triple-@xmath0-decay thresholds and can be seen in the near - threshold @xmath11 state .",
    "it is interesting that the present gcm calculation which neglects an explicit coupling to both @xmath0-decay channels is capable to follow the transition from a predominantly shell model wave function in the ground state @xmath166 to an almost pure cluster wave function in @xmath11 excited state .",
    "nuclear clustering escapes the description in terms of the standard shell model which simply fails to predict cluster states at observed low excitation energies around cluster - decay threshold .",
    "generic explanation of this enigmatic phenomenon involves understanding of the role played by the coupling of shell model states via the decay channel(s ) . in this work ,",
    "we have proposed a simple approach based on the improved aqcm parametrization to describe a transition from the @xmath0-cluster wave function to the @xmath1-coupling shell model wave function . as compared to the previous aqcm @xcite which allows the transformation of a single @xmath0 cluster into a quasi-@xmath0 cluster , in the improved aqcm we expand the model space and spin directions can be oriented in any direction . in the new formulation , _ all _ @xmath0 clusters of a nucleus",
    "can be changed into quasi-@xmath0 clusters .",
    "hence , a destructive interference of the spin - orbit coupling and clustering can be investigated in a single variational wave function .",
    "the relation between the shell and cluster models was established in the harmonic oscillator limit @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ via the su(3 ) symmetry @xcite . in the symmetry - adopted models , like su(3 )",
    "shell model @xcite , the symplectic shell model @xcite , or the semimicroscopic algebraic cluster model @xcite , one may characterize the relative importance of the shell and cluster components by the su(3 ) content of the realistic wave function .",
    "the other way is to split the interaction into su(3)-preserving and a su(3)-breaking parts .",
    "their relative weights can then be used as a control parameter to indicate how close the real situation is to the intersection point of the two models @xcite . in the shell model ,",
    "typical symmetry - preserving parts are the harmonic oscillator and quadrupole forces , while important symmetry - breaking parts are the spin - orbit and pairing interactions . in the cluster model ,",
    "the symmetric parts are again the harmonic oscillator and quadrupole forces , and the symmetry - breaking interaction can be e.g. the dipole interaction . in the @xmath173 shell",
    ", where the su(3 ) model reduces to wigner s supermultiplet theory @xcite , the joint conclusion of many works is that for the ground state of the @xmath2c nucleus the @xmath174 su(3 ) symmetry is a good approximation .",
    "the recent studies using the no - core shell model @xcite confirms the dominance of the @xmath174 component in the wave function @xcite .    the aqcm proposed in this work , provides a possibility for going from the molecule - like clusterization to the @xmath1 coupled shell model limit directly , in a single step , contrary to the two - step procedure of the shell- and cluster - model calculations with different symmetry - breaking terms , as we discussed in ref .",
    "this model does not apply the su(3 ) basis , thus a detailed comparison with the standard shell model is not easy . based on analytical and numerical studies , we have shown that the aqcm wave function in the limit @xmath56 and @xmath27 corresponds to the @xmath138 closed shell configuration of @xmath2c .",
    "the proposed parametrization allows to determine an optimal wave function of @xmath2c in a variational procedure for each chosen effective nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "the optimal aqcm ground state of @xmath2c is an intermediate state between the three-@xmath0 cluster state and the shell model state with the @xmath5 subshell closure configuration . from a comparison with the amd model , where all nucleons are treated independently",
    ", we found that the aqcm result is consistent with the amd result ( overlap is about 99% ) even though the number of degrees of freedom in the aqcm trial wave function is significantly fewer than in the amd .",
    "the aqcm can be applied to heavier nuclei as well . in @xmath175-shell nuclei",
    ", a variational wave function has to include both clusters and quasi - clusters to describe pure shell model configurations . in some cases ,",
    "the aqcm wave function contains more than one configuration , e.g. in @xmath176si one configuration is a pentagon of quasi-@xmath0 clusters on the @xmath177-plane and two @xmath0 clusters along the @xmath39-axis , and another configuration is a tetrahedron of @xmath0 clusters whose center of gravity is at the origin of the coordinate system and a triangle of three quasi-@xmath0 clusters on the @xmath177-plane surrounding it . if we take the zero limit for the relative distances among @xmath0 clusters and quasi clusters , these two configurations become identical and give the lowest shell model configuration @xmath178 at @xmath27 .    a prolate shape cluster configuration @xmath7o+@xmath2c is also expected to play a role in the low - energy region of @xmath176si .",
    "in such a configuration , one can easily prepare @xmath2c as the @xmath1-coupling shell model wave function @xmath55 using the improved aqcm parametrisation .",
    "the optimal configuration of @xmath176si can then be obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix comprised of these different configurations .",
    "the aqcm studies open new perspectives in studies of cluster - shell competition in various particle - stable systems , including neutron - rich carbon nuclei , heavy @xmath179 nuclei , or hypernuclei .",
    "the generic explanation of nuclear clustering , its universal occurrence and properties , involves understanding of the role played by the coupling of shell model states via the decay channel(s ) .",
    "this coupling leads to the formation of the collective near - threshold eigenstate of the open quantum system .",
    "the coupling results in the anti - hermitian component , and interplay between hermitian and anti - hermitian terms is a source of collective near - threshold phenomena in the ensemble of shell model states @xcite .",
    "the coupling to decay channels in aqcm , which could be included through the complex scaling method , is a challenging subject to be addressed in the near future .",
