    "it has been over forty years since bekenstein and hawking first disclosed that black hole can be considered as a thermodynamic system , with characteristic temperature and entropy @xcite .",
    "taking into account the fact that black holes have no hair , there are no classical degrees of freedom to account for such thermodynamic properties .",
    "it is a general belief that thermodynamic properties of a system may reflect the statistical mechanics of underlying relevant microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "but the detailed nature of these microscopic gravitational states has remained as a mystery .",
    "the bekenstein - hawking entropy , @xmath6 , depends on both planck s constant as well as newtonian gravitational constant , implying that thermodynamics of black holes may relate quantum mechanics and gravity .",
    "recently , there have been some progresses on understanding the microscopic degrees of freedom of the black hole entropy , for example in string theory @xcite as well as loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "but the accounts of the black hole entropy are not complete and they only work within some particular models and some special domains where string theory and loop quantum gravity can apply .",
    "besides , despite counting very different states , many inequivalent approaches to quantum gravity obtain identical results and it is not clear why any counting of microstates should reproduce the same bekenstein - hawking entropy @xcite .",
    "the statistical mechanical description of black hole entropy is still not elegant .    on the other side ,",
    "black hole can be heated or cooled though absorption and evaporation processes . according to boltzmann s insight ,",
    "if a system can be heated , it must have microscopic structures .",
    "recently , in @xcite , possible microscopic structures of a charged anti - de sitter black hole have been studied and some kind of interactions between possible micromolecules have been investigated by an interesting physical tool , the ruppeiner geometry . derived from the thermodynamic fluctuation theory , the ruppeiner geometry @xcite is considered powerful to explore the possible interactions between black hole microscopic structures .",
    "the sign of the ruppeiner invariant @xmath7 ( the ricci scalar of ruppeiner geometry ) was argued to be useful for identifying the physical systems similar to the fermi ( bose ) ideal gas when @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) or the classical ideal gas when @xmath10 @xcite . besides",
    ", the sign of the ruppeiner invariant @xmath7 can further be used to interpret the type of the dominated interaction between molecules of a thermodynamic system . when @xmath8 , there is a repulsive interaction between molecules , when @xmath9 the interaction is attractive , and for @xmath11 there is no interaction in the microstates rup2,rup3,rup4",
    ". moreover , the magnitude of the ruppeiner invariant @xmath12 measures the average number of correlated planck areas on the event horizon for a black hole system rup05 . for a review on the description of the ruppeiner geometry in black hole systems",
    ", we refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "further studies on molecular interactions of black holes , based on the ruppeiner geometry , have been carried out in @xcite .",
    "phase transition is another interesting topic in black holes thermodynamics .",
    "davies discussed thermodynamic phase transition of the black holes by looking at the behavior of the heat capacity @xcite .",
    "he claimed that the discontinuity of the heat capacity marks the second order phase transition in black holes .",
    "however , it was argued that physical properties do not show any speciality at this discontinuity point if compared with other heat capacity values , for example the regularity of the event horizon is not lost and the black hole internal state remains uninfluenced @xcite .",
    "thus , it is hard to accept the discontinuity point of the heat capacity as a true physical point of the phase transition . employing the landau - lifshitz theory of thermodynamic fluctuations ll1,ll2 , pavon and rubi gave a deep understanding of the black hole phase transition @xcite .",
    "they found that some second moments in the fluctuation of relevant thermodynamic quantities diverge when the black hole becomes extreme .",
    "this divergence shows that the thermodynamic fluctuation is tremendous and the rigorous meaning of thermodynamical quantities is broken down .",
    "this is exactly the characteristic of the thermodynamic phase transition point . at this phase transition point",
    ", the hawking temperature is zero which indicates that for the extreme black hole there is only super - radiation but no hawking radiation , which is in sharp difference from that of the non - extreme black holes .",
    "black holes phase transition in the context of landau - lifshitz theory have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "recently , further differences in dynamical properties before and after the black hole thermodynamical phase transition has been disclosed in wang2,wang3,wang4 .",
    "a question now arises : how we can further understand this macroscopic thermodynamic phase transition in black hole physics ?",
    "for example whether there is a microscopic explanation of this thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "the ruppeiner geometry is a possible tool we can use to investigate the thermodynamic phase transitions from microscopic point of view .",
    "this method is safer to determine true phase transitions than other methods since regardless of microscopic model , @xmath7 has a unique status in identifying microscopic order ( which is at foundation of phase transitions at microscopic level ) from thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "some attempts , in this direction , have been reported in rupgeo1,rupgeo11,rupgeo2,rupgeo3,rupgeo4,rupgeo5,rupgeo6,rupgeo61,rupgeo7,rupgeo8,rupgeo9,rupgeo10 . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", it was found that the divergence of the ruppeiner invariant coincides with the critical point in the phase transition in a holographic superconductor model .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether the ruppeiner geometry @xcite can present us further reason to determine which of the thermodynamical discussions mentioned above is valid for describing the thermodynamical phase transition . in particular , we would like to explore whether the davies phase transition conjecture can reflect some special properties in microstructures and be in consistent with the ruppeiner geometry description .",
    "if the davies conjecture does not have the microscopic explanation , we will further think about how to improve the davies conjecture to describe the black hole phase transition .",
    "we will employ the black hole in lifshitz spacetime as a configuration to study our physical problems mentioned above .",
    "this spacetime was first introduced in @xcite , which respects the anisotropic conformal transformation @xmath13 , @xmath14 , where @xmath2 is dynamical critical exponent .",
    "for the lifshitz spacetime , it is necessary to include some matter sources such as massive gauge fields @xcite or higher - curvature corrections @xcite to guarantee the asymptotic behavior of the lifshitz black hole .",
    "it is difficult to find an analytic lifshitz black hole solution for arbitrary @xmath2 , although some attempts have been performed @xcite .",
    "this makes the discussion of thermodynamics for such a black hole difficult .",
    "fortunately , in einstein - dilaton gravity with a massless gauge field , it is possible to find an exact lifshitz black solution for arbitrary @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this model is suggested in the low energy limit of string theory @xcite . while thermodynamical behaviors of uncharged and charged einstein - dilaton - lifshitz black holes",
    "have been revealed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , thermodynamics of uncharged gauss - bonnet - dilaton - lifshitz solution has been studied in @xcite . it is also interesting to study lifshitz black hole solutions in the presence of other gauge fields such as the power - law maxwell field @xcite , the logarithmic @xcite and exponential exp nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "for example , thermodynamics and thermal and dynamical stabilities of einstein - dilaton - lifshitz solutions in the presence of power - law maxwell field have been studied in @xcite . in the context of ads",
    "/ cft @xcite application , the electrical conductivity were explored for exponentially @xcite and logarithmic @xcite charged lifshitz solutions . in the present work , we shall consider the born - infeld ( bi ) nonlinear electrodynamics in the context of einstein - dilaton - lifshitz black holes .",
    "the motivation for considering bi - dilaton action comes from the fact that dynamics of d - branes and some soliton solutions of supergravity is governed by the born - infeld ( bi ) action @xcite . besides",
    ", the low energy limit of open superstring theory suggest the bi electrodynamic action coupled to dilaton field @xcite .",
    "it is surprising to mention that , many years before the appearance of bi action in superstring theory , in 1930 s , this nonlinear electrodynamics was introduced for the first time , with the aim of solving the infinite self - energy problem of a point - like charged particle by imposing a maximum strength for the electromagnetic field @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will first look for a general ( @xmath15)-dimensional lifshitz black hole solution in the context of einstein - dilaton gravity in the presence of bi electrodynamics .",
    "we will show that the general metric function has different solutions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 cases .",
    "it is important to note that the difference in the metric function has not been observed in the previous studies on lifshitz - dilaton black holes kord2,kord3,kord4 .",
    "based on this general solution , we will study thermodynamics of lifshitz - dilaton black holes coupled to linear maxwell field and bi nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "we will disclose that the hawking - page phase transition @xcite exists both in the presence of linear and nonlinear electrodynamics .",
    "there are some attempts on study phase transitions of uncharged lifshitz solutions for fixed @xmath2 @xcite or in three @xcite and four @xcite dimensions .",
    "the disclosed hawking - page phase transition in this paper is interesting , since it depends on different values of @xmath2 in different spacetime dimensions in the presence of linear maxwell and nonlinear bi electrodynamic fields .",
    "we will further concentrate our attention to understand the thermodynamic phase transition from microstructures .",
    "we shall examine the relation between the ruppeiner geometry and thermodynamical descriptions of the phase transition such as the davies conjecture and the landau - lifshitz method .",
    "we try to give more microscopic understanding of the thermodynamical phase transitions in the black hole system .",
    "we explore the thermodynamic geometry ( ruppeiner geometry ) for linearly and nonlinearly charged lifshitz solutions separately and disclose the properties of interactions between possible black hole molecules . up to our best knowledge",
    ", there is no study of thermodynamic geometry on lifshitz solutions in literature .",
    "interestingly enough , by studying ruppeiner geometry , we have found that our solutions show the van der waals like behavior near critical point in some cases .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we provide the basic field equations and obtain the bi charged lifshitz - dilaton black hole solutions . in section [ thermo ] , we first explore the satisfaction of the thermodynamics first law for lifshitz - dilaton black holes in the presence of bi electrodynamics .",

    "[ fig1a ] and [ fig1b ] respectively .",
    "it is notable to mention that in the case of @xmath0 , there is no schwartzshild - like black hole since in this case @xmath56  goes to positive infinity as @xmath65  goes to zero .",

    "<S> we find that there are two different solutions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 cases where @xmath2 is dynamical critical exponent and @xmath3 is the number of spatial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> calculating the conserved and thermodynamical quantities , we show that the first law of thermodynamics is satisfied for both cases . </S>",
    "<S> then , we turn to study different phase transitions for our lifshitz black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we start with hawking - page phase transition and explore the effects of different parameters of our model on it for both linearly and bi charged cases . </S>",
    "<S> after that , we discuss the phase transitions inside the black holes . </S>",
    "<S> we present the improved davies quantities and prove that the phase transition points shown by them are in coincident with ruppeiner ones . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the zero temperature phase transitions are transitions on radiance properties of black holes by using landau - lifshitz theory of thermodynamic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> next , we turn to study ruppeiner geometry ( thermodynamic geometry ) for our solutions . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate thermal stability , interaction type of possible black hole molecules and phase transitions of our solutions for linearly and bi charged cases separately . for linearly charged case , we show that there are no phase transition at finite temperature for the case @xmath4 . for @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the number of finite temperature phase transition points depends on the value of black hole charge and is not more than two . </S>",
    "<S> when we have two finite temperature phase transition points , there are no thermally stable black hole between these two points and we have discontinues small / large black hole phase transitions . as expected , for small black holes , we observe finite magnitude for ruppeiner invariant which shows the finite correlation between possible black hole molecules while for large black holes , the correlation is very small . finally , we study the ruppeiner geometry and thermal stability of bi charged lifshtiz black holes for different values of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that small black holes are thermally unstable in some situations . also , the behavior of correlation between possible black hole molecules for large black holes is the same as linearly charged case . in both linearly and bi charged cases , for some choices of parameters , </S>",
    "<S> the black hole systems behave like a van der waals gas near transition point . </S>"
