    "the top quark is the heaviest elementary particle discovered so far , and in many ways it is a very uncommon quark .",
    "the fact that its electroweak decay is faster than the hadronization timescale implies that the top quark exists only as a free quark , so that the effects from new physics could show up very clearly by comparing measurements with the precise standard model preditions .",
    "its `` re - discovery '' at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has been a major milestone for the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments , due to the complexity of its final state which demands a good control of the experimental apparatus .",
    "its expected large coupling to the sm higgs boson will also be relevant as a test of the standard model .",
    "atlas and cms recorded more than 5 fb@xmath0  of pp collisions delivered by the lhc at 7  tev during 2011 . at the time of writing , the plans for running in 2012 are not final and the beam energy itself is still under discussion . here",
    "we assume that at least 10 fb@xmath0  will have been collected at 7 tev by the time of the next top workshop , and we discuss the kind of analyses that become possible with this amount of data .",
    "the inclusive cross section for pair - produced top quarks ( @xmath1 ) is now predicted at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in perturbative qcd , and several approaches have been pursued to approximate the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo )  @xcite . the theoretical uncertainty for the cross section of pair - produced top quarks in pp collisions at 7 tev is around 10% , dominated by the uncertainty on the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) .",
    "the corresponding measurements performed by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite ( figure  [ fig : sqrts ] , left ) already reached a similar precision with data sets of around 1 fb@xmath0 , starting to challenge theory .",
    "although the statistical uncertainty is not anymore one of the leading uncertainties of these measurements , larger data sets will indirectly yield benefits : by allowing to trade off statistics for purity with tighter selection thresholds , and by reducing uncertainties coming from the sidebands used to constrain the main systematic uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainty on luminosity of about 5% is very unlikely to improve significantly ; the solution would be to quote ratios of the @xmath1  cross section over those of w and z boson production , whose comparison with theory represents a good handle to constrain pdfs .",
    "the gluon pdf can be constrained very effectively by measuring differential cross sections versus the rapidity and @xmath2  of the @xmath1  system .",
    "cross section measurements at tevatron and lhc and expectations as a function of @xmath3 for top quark pair production ( left ) and t - channel single top quark production ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ] cross section measurements at tevatron and lhc and expectations as a function of @xmath3 for top quark pair production ( left ) and t - channel single top quark production ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    a differential distribution of great importance is the @xmath4 spectrum . mostly used so far by both collaborations to set limits on narrow resonances that decay to @xmath1  @xcite , this distribution might be deformed in many ways by new physics ( e.g. , tail enhancement , peak - dip from interference , etc . ) ; assuming the sm , it can be used for an alternative measurement of the mass of the top quark  @xcite .",
    "the boosted - top tagging technique  @xcite applied by cms in the all - hadronic channel  @xcite could be extended to the hadronic side in the lepton+jets final state , further enhancing the sensitivity of this search by the addition of a smaller but independent data sample .",
    "recently , the cdf and d0 experiments reported tantalizing hints of a significant forward - backward asymmetry between top and anti - top quarks in @xmath1  production with @xmath5 collisions at 1.96  tev  @xcite , larger than the expectation from nlo qcd , stimulating a large production of theoretical papers to account for the excess in terms of new physics  @xcite .",
    "no forward - backward asymmetry is observable at lhc because of the charge symmetry of the initial state , but both cms  @xcite and atlas  @xcite exploit the difference in average momentum between quarks and antiquarks in the initial state in @xmath6 collisions , and report differential distributions in @xmath7 ( atlas ) , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( cms ) .",
    "these distributions are unfolded to correct for selection and reconstruction inefficiencies and biases and therefore allowing an easier comparison with theory predictions from new physics models .",
    "both experiments also report integrated asymmetries in these variables , i.e. , @xmath10 finding values compatible with zero and with the small sm expectation .",
    "cms also reported @xmath11 and @xmath12 versus @xmath4 , finding no hint for any dependence .",
    "the greatest challenge for analyses at the lhc comes from the fact that the majority of partonic collisions at 7 tev involve two gluons , while a charge asymmetry is typically expected to come from @xmath13 initial states . with more statistics",
    ", lhc analyses will be able to correlate the asymmetry measurement with the @xmath13 fraction and with initial state radiation , for example by measuring @xmath11 and @xmath12 as a function of the @xmath2  or boost of the @xmath1  system  @xcite , and the number of associated jets .",
    "associated production ( @xmath14 ) will provide important constraints on the couplings of the top quark . with 10 fb@xmath0",
    ", the couplings to heavy vector bosons will be measurable thanks to a sizeable number of clean @xmath15 and @xmath16 events .",
    "the atlas collaboration presented a first study of @xmath17 events  @xcite for photon energies above 8 gev , yielding a result compatible with the sm expectation and incompatible with the no - photon hypothesis at @xmath18 level . with more statistics , in addition to providing a measurement of the charge of a naked quark , this channel will yield constraints to excited top quarks ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the most interesting associated production is arguably the process @xmath20 , which is sensitive to the yukawa coupling of the higgs boson to the top quark and therefore would test the sm correspondence between @xmath21 and @xmath22 , a particularly important issue given the strikingly high value of the latter and the suggestive `` coincidence '' of @xmath23 as inferred from the top quark mass .",
    "the main challenges of the @xmath20 search are the large combinatorics ( especially in the @xmath24 decay channel , favoured at low higgs boson masses ) and the difficulty to model the @xmath25 and @xmath26 backgrounds ; comparatively little effort has been devoted by the lhc collaborations to this search , after simulation studies of the prospects with realistic conditions concluded that very large data sets would have been necessary for discovery in this channel  @xcite .",
    "more recently , though , the improvement of several analysis tools , which already allowed atlas and cms to outperform their own expectations in a wide range of physics topics , and the development of new ones , like the algorithms for boosted objects  @xcite , induce to think that sensitivity to a light higgs boson associated to @xmath1  might come much earlier than foreseen by these studies  @xcite . a guaranteed outcome , in any case , will be a better understanding of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 processes ( a first atlas study has been reported for the latter  @xcite ) , which constitute by themselves a precious testbed for perturbative qcd .",
    "single top quark production , first observed by cdf and d0 in 2009  @xcite , has been quickly confirmed by cms and atlas in t - channel production  @xcite ( figure  [ fig : sqrts ] , right ) .",
    "tevatron and lhc collisions give access to different mixtures of electroweak single - top processes  @xcite : t - channel and s - channel production contribute less evenly at 7 tev ( 65 pb and 5 pb respectively ) than at 1.96 tev ( 2 pb and 1 pb ) , and @xmath27-associated production ( @xmath28 ) which is virtually inaccessible at the tevatron becomes the second - largest contributor at the lhc ( 15 pb ) , and a significant background in @xmath1  studies and higgs boson searches .",
    "both collaborations have presented their first results on @xmath28  @xcite and atlas has set an upper limit ( roughly five times the sm prediction ) on the s - channel process  @xcite .",
    "all these measurements are already limited by systematic uncertainties , and most of the planned developments will focus on strategies for an _ in situ _ control of the main systematics , and on better background rejection , mostly by means of multivariate analyses .",
    "precision measurements of all three production modes will have a deep impact on pdf constraints , with the three channels being complementary to each other and also to @xmath1  production .",
    "for example , t - channel and @xmath28 cross sections are sensitive to the @xmath29-quark pdf and anticorrelated with the @xmath30 cross section , while the s - channel ( essentially a drell - yan process ) is insensitive to the @xmath29-quark pdf and can therefore act as a control , and it is correlated with the @xmath30 cross section , like the @xmath1  cross section  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the charge asymmetry in t - channel production as a function of the top / antitop rapidity will provide a very powerful input for constraining pdfs , similar to the @xmath27 production case .",
    "different beyond - sm models predict different effects in the different production channels  @xcite .",
    "a few examples follow , reasoning in a bottom - up approach ( i.e. , starting from the possible observations to infer which model would be favored ) :    * a deficit in all three channels would naturally lead to suspect @xmath31 ( and the existence of new quarks )  @xcite ; this can be verified by precisely measuring @xmath32 in @xmath1  events ( section  [ sec : couplings ] ) ; * an excess in the s - channel , not confirmed in the other two , would induce to suspect a charged resonance ( e.g. , a right - handed @xmath33 , whose coupling to light fermions would be suppressed by helicity conservation and would therefore be visible in the @xmath34 final state and not in electronic or muonic decays ) , which would be confirmed by a peak or a peak - dip structure in the @xmath35 spectrum ; * an excess in the t - channel , not confirmed in the other two , could be due to new interactions causing flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) : even with tiny @xmath36 and @xmath37 couplings , the very large up - quark density at high @xmath38 in the proton would allow a visible signal to show up ; important checks would be the differential measurements of @xmath39 and of the single top polarization ( section  [ sec : spin ] ) ; * an excess in the t - channel and in the @xmath28 channel , with no deviation from the sm in the polarization of the top quark , and a deficit in the s - channel could be due to large @xmath40 or @xmath41 ( non - unitarity of the ckm matrix ) , to be checked by measuring @xmath39 and @xmath42 .",
    "a crucial property of the top quark is its lifetime which is shorter than the qcd de - coherence timescale , causing its decay products to retain memory of its helicity .",
    "this provides additional powerful tools in the search for new physics , both in @xmath1  and single top studies : single top production in t- and s - channel yields 100% polarized top quarks if only electroweak interactions are involved , while different new physics models yield different polarizations ; pair - produced tops are unpolarized but theirs spins are correlated , and the spin of a neutral resonance decaying in @xmath1  can be directly inferred by the spin correlation , which in the sm depends uniquely on pdfs ( fraction of @xmath43 initial states ) and provides a handle to constrain them under the assumption of no new physics .",
    "the atlas collaboration presented a first study of @xmath1  spin correlations  @xcite , showing a better than 40% precision on the correlation coefficient with 0.7 fb@xmath0  in dileptonic events by fitting the difference in azimuthal angle between the two charged leptons . extrapolating from older simulation studies with full event reconstruction",
    ", @xmath4410% seems realistic with the expected 2012 dataset in both the dilepton and single lepton channels  @xcite .",
    "single top polarization in the t - channel is already manifest in the slope of the @xmath45 distribution , defined as the angle between the charged lepton and the light jet in the reconstructed top quark rest frame .",
    "the sm expectation @xmath46  @xcite has even been exploited in one of the cms cross section analyses  @xcite to better identify the sm signal ; the next generation analyses , with more data , will have the possibility of a precision measurement of @xmath47 , sensitive to new physics ( section  [ sec : st ] ) .",
    "information on the @xmath48 vertex comes from several complementary inputs . the cross section of all single top channels ( section  [ sec : st ] ) measures `` directly '' @xmath49 under the assumption that @xmath50 and the coupling is purely left - handed ( @xmath51 ) , while @xmath42 measures @xmath49 under the assumption that the ckm @xmath52 matrix is unitary and that @xmath51 ; atlas and cms will soon challenge the most precise measurement from d0 , @xmath53  @xcite . the combination of @xmath42 with all single top cross sections would give a less model - dependent handle on @xmath49  @xcite although still with the @xmath51 assumption .",
    "a handle on the anomalous components of the @xmath48 coupling comes from the polarization of the @xmath27 boson from top quark decays in @xmath1  events , already measured by atlas with 0.7 fb@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the combination of this information with the single top cross section is sufficient to set constraints in the @xmath54 hyper - plane under the assumption @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "an improvement of more than a factor 2 - 3 in the precision of either of the two inputs at the lhc is needed to improve over the limits from tevatron , and is realistic with less than 10 fb@xmath0 .",
    "another goal for 2012 is the improvement of the existing limits on the forbidden fcnc couplings @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "first studies have been performed by atlas with 35 pb@xmath0  @xcite with two strategies : limits on @xmath59 and @xmath60 couplings have been set by searching for @xmath61 and @xmath62 events ( with @xmath63 decay ) , and on @xmath64 in the @xmath65 process . with",
    "10 fb@xmath0  the lhc experiments have the potential to improve the limits set at previous accelerators ( lep , hera , tevatron ) .",
    "complementary constraints on @xmath59 and @xmath60 couplings would come from single top measurements , sections  [ sec : st ] and  [ sec : spin ] .",
    "it will be very challenging for the lhc experiments to improve the 0.5% precision on @xmath22 achieved at the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "the traditional direct reconstruction methods are systematics - limited , therefore a tenfold increase in statistics does nt help _ per se_.    a crucial direction for improvement is the study of additional methods uncorrelated with the traditional analyses .",
    "for example , cdf pioneered methods for mass extraction based on the charged lepton spectrum  @xcite or the @xmath29-hadron decay length  @xcite or both  @xcite .",
    "both observables have the advantage of negligible dependence on the jet energy scale , which is the limiting factor in direct reconstruction methods .",
    "the lepton - spectrum method offers the further advantage , with the @xmath27 boson being emitted before qcd enters the picture , that the mass that it measures is conceptually closer to the pole mass . while these studies were statistics limited at the tevatron and were therefore not used in the combination ,",
    "the lhc experiments have the double advantage of a much larger dataset and of a better purity . despite additional complications coming from the significant boost of the top quarks ,",
    "a precision of @xmath66  gev seems realistic with 10 fb@xmath0  at 7 tev .",
    "an original technique proposed in cms simulation studies  @xcite and never applied so far in data exploits the @xmath67 decay chain ( @xmath68 branching ratio , yielding around 900 events in 10 fb@xmath0  at 7 tev ) and the correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath69 .",
    "the dependence on the jet energy scale is negligible , @xmath29 tagging is not needed ( the presence of a @xmath70 is sufficient to reject most light jets ) , and the systematic uncertainty ( @xmath71  gev ) is dominated by the modeling uncertainties , especially fragmentation .",
    "at the time of writing a possible increase to 8 tev during the 2012 run is under discussion . running at higher energies",
    "is in general less crucial for sm precision measurements than for searches of new physics , but testing the dependence of the cross sections versus @xmath3  will be an important test of the production models .",
    "the signal - to - background ratio improves from 7 to 8  tev : @xmath1  ( figure  [ fig : sqrts ] , left ) and @xmath28 cross section would increase by 50% and t - channel single top by 30% ( figure  [ fig : sqrts ] , right ) , against a 20% increase for inclusive @xmath27 production and 25% for the @xmath72 process ( with @xmath73 ) .",
    "in addition , analyses can take advantage from the different dependences of these processes on energy , e.g. , by simultaneous fits to 7 and 8  tev data with @xmath74 ratios constrained to sm expectations .",
    "with an accumulated statistics of more than 10 fb@xmath0  ( either all at 7 tev , or shared between 7 and 8 tev ) the lhc will be even more established as `` the top factory '' , and top physics itself will be even more established as a powerful tool for direct and indirect new physics searches , with strong complementarity between the different production modes .",
    "although most of the precision measurements start already to be systematics - limited , larger datasets would help in many ways : tighter selections can be applied , high - statistics sidebands can better constrain the main systematic uncertainties , and orthogonal analyses with low rate may become competitive in the combination with standard methods .",
    "in addition , the extensive validation of the background models and the better understanding of most experimental and modeling systematics will allow more dedicated analysis techniques .",
    "for all these reasons , plus the confidence in the ingenuity of the experimental community , we can confidently look forward to an unprecedentedly rich top physics program to be presented at top2012 .",
    "the author wishes to thank the top2011 organizers and participants for the wonderful atmosphere , roberto tenchini , roberto chierici , jeannine wagner - kuhr , joe incandela and ford garberson for many useful inputs , and the estonian academy of science for supporting this work with the mobilitas top researcher grant mtt59 .    0",
