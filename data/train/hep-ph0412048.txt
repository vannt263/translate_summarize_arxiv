    "recently , the high - energy spectroscopic system ( hess ) collaboration has reported the detection of gamma - rays from the region of the galactic center with energies ranging between approximately 250 gev and 10 tev @xcite .",
    "two other atmospheric cerenkov telescopes ( acts ) , cangaroo - ii  @xcite and whipple  @xcite have also reported positive detections of very high - energy gamma - rays from the region , although with considerably lower significance .",
    "currently , the origin of this very high - energy emission is unknown .",
    "efforts have been made to explain the data with astrophysical processes involving the supermassive black hole known to exist at the galactic center @xcite . although these are certainly possible explanations , the source of the observed emission is not yet clear .",
    "gamma - ray observations of the galactic center have long been studied as one of the most promising methods to search for particle dark matter @xcite .",
    "the most popular dark matter candidates  @xcite , such as the lightest neutralino in @xmath2-parity conserving supersymmetric models , are generally much lighter than the highest energy gamma - rays seen by hess , and therefore can not possibly generate the observed spectrum .",
    "it has been shown that a dark matter particle annihilating through typical channels ( @xmath3 ) would require a mass between 12 and 29 tev to generate this spectrum @xcite .",
    "in addition to the unacceptable levels of fine tuning which would be required , a neutralino in this mass range would generate far more dark matter during thermal freeze - out than is observed .",
    "for these reasons , we do not consider a very heavy neutralino to be a likely source of the flux observed by hess .",
    "models of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) provide an interesting alternative to neutralino ( or other lightest supersymmetric particle ) dark matter .",
    "typically in these models , supersymmetry breaking originates in a strongly interacting sector ( the supersymmetry breaking sector ) and is communicated to the superpartners of the standard model ( sm ) states by sm gauge interactions with particles within a messenger sector @xcite .",
    "it is natural for the lightest messenger particle to be stable , electrically neutral and have a mass on the order of a few times 10 tev .",
    "such a particle , as we will show , can have an annihilation cross section which generates a thermal relic density consistent with the measured dark matter density of the universe . in this letter",
    ", we calculate the gamma - ray spectrum generated in the annihilations of gmsb messenger dark matter and show that this particle can be a viable source of the very high - energy gamma - rays observed by hess .",
    "gmsb models typically contain a messenger sector , charged under the sm gauge group , which communicates supersymmetry breaking to the superpartners of sm states by sm gauge interactions .",
    "such gauge communication of supersymmetry breaking has the great advantage that unobserved flavour - changing - neutral - current , @xmath4-violating , and rare decay processes arising from the soft - supersymmetry - breaking terms are automatically absent , in contrast to most other methods of communication .",
    "since supersymmetry breaking is communicated by renormalizable gauge interactions , the fundamental scale of supersymmetry breaking in gmsb models is much lower than for supergravity communication , possibly as low as 50 to 100  tev depending on the interactions between the superymmetry breaking and messenger sectors . as a consequence ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the gravitino , with mass , @xmath5 ev . such a mass is far too small to contribute substantially to the dark matter density of the universe .",
    "thus , in this class of models , it is necessary to look beyond the lsp for the constituents of dark matter .",
    "fortunately in the simplest class of gmsb models , the messenger sector naturally contains a stable state with mass of a few ten s of tev .",
    "messenger particles in gmsb models have been studied as potential dark matter candidates in the past . in refs .",
    "@xcite , minimal supersymmetric models with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking were studied . in these models ,",
    "the messenger sector consists only of particles carrying su(3)@xmath6su(2)@xmath6u(1 ) charge , the lightest of which will be stable if the supersymmetry breaking sector contains only singlets charged under this group . in substantial portions of the parameter space",
    ", the lightest messenger state is a massive complex scalar with the sm gauge quantum numbers of a left handed neutrino .",
    "this simple model ultimately fails to provide a viable dark matter candidate , however . with only gauge interactions to contribute to its annihilation rate in the early universe",
    ", it has been shown that such a particle must be lighter than a few tev to not overclose the universe  @xcite .",
    "in addition to being too light to produce the very high - energy gamma - rays observed by hess , such a dark matter candidate is excluded by direct detection searches .    a very simple way to extend the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is to introduce an additional higgs singlet .",
    "this model , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) , has several advantages compared to the mssm .",
    "most notably , it provides a natural mechanism for the @xmath7-parameter to obtain a value near the electroweak scale ( which is required for acceptable electroweak symmetry breaking ) , rather than @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "it also ameliorates the mild fine tuning that now must be imposed on the mssm due to the lep ii constraints on the higgs mass .",
    "the structure of the nmssm can be used to motivate an extension of the gmsb messenger sector to include such an extra higgs singlet field , @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the superpotential for this sector is then given by : @xmath11 here @xmath12 is a standard model gauge singlet spurion which parameterizes the supersymmetry breaking sector , with expectation values for the scalar and supersymmetry - breaking @xmath13 components , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the messenger fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 are in complete @xmath18 and @xmath19 representations of su(5)@xmath20su(3)@xmath6su(2)@xmath6u(1 ) , so contain su(3 ) triplet states with the gauge quantum numbers of the right handed down quarks and su(2)-doublet states with the gauge quantum numbers of the left handed lepton doublet .",
    "the higgs doublets @xmath21 and @xmath22 couple to up and down type fermions , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are expected to be @xmath25 while @xmath26 and @xmath27 have to to be considerably smaller ( @xmath010@xmath28 ) to give a consistent phenomenology for the @xmath7 and @xmath29 parameters  @xcite . at the tree level ,",
    "the fermion components of the @xmath30 fields have , as a result of @xmath31 , a common dirac mass , @xmath32 , while because of susy - breaking the scalar components split into two groups with mass - squared @xmath33 . at the one - loop level ,",
    "the masses of the lighter group of scalars are further split , and the lightest of these scalars is the dark matter candidate .",
    "a computation shows that the color - charged scalars are significantly raised in mass , while the splitting between the lightest electrically charged , @xmath34 , and neutral , @xmath35 , messenger is  @xcite @xmath36 -\\log\\left[\\frac{m^2+f}{m^2-f}\\right ] + \\frac{2f}{m^2-f}\\log\\left[\\frac{2f}{m^2+f}\\right ] -4 \\right ) .",
    "\\label{split}\\ ] ] a physically acceptable model of messenger dark matter requires that this splitting be positive , so that the neutral scalar is the lightest state , and large enough such that charged state @xmath34 decays via @xmath37 to avoid the presence of exotic quasi - stable charged particles .",
    "this is too restrictive , however , as for messenger masses in the 20 tev range under consideration the total energy deposited from such decays is well below the limits set by bbn photodisociation .",
    "] this requires @xmath38  mev , which for @xmath39  tev imposes @xmath40 , leading to @xmath41  tev , while for @xmath42  tev , @xmath43 is necessary , leading to @xmath44  tev .",
    "thus we see that the physically relevant range of candidate dark matter messenger masses is @xmath45  tev .",
    "the potential that results from the minimizing of the superpotential eqn .",
    "[ superpot ] includes the terms : @xmath46 these three terms represent the vertices @xmath10-@xmath17-@xmath16 , @xmath10-@xmath10-@xmath10 and @xmath10-@xmath21-@xmath22 , respectively , each with a coupling enhanced by the vacuum expectation value of @xmath12 , @xmath47 tev .",
    "it is because of this large vacuum expectation value that other terms in the potential which do not contain a factor of @xmath12 can be safely neglected in our calculation .",
    "furthermore , we can neglect terms that include the small parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these couplings lead to the following diagrams for messenger annihilation :    ( 222,204)(3,4.3 ) ( 0.,20.)(15.,10.)(0.,)/straight+1 ( -5.,18.0)[b]@xmath16 ( 15.,-5.0)(15.,10.0)(0.,)/straight-1 ( 0.,-15.0)(15.,-5.0)(0.,)/straight-1 ( -5.,-18.0)[b]@xmath17 ( 10.,0.0)[b]@xmath16 ( 15.,10.)(30.,20.)(0.,)/scalardash0 ( 15.,-5.)(30.,-15.0)(0.,)/scalardash0 ( 35.,21.5)[t]@xmath10 ( 35.,-15.)[t]@xmath10    ( 222,204)(3,4.3 )    ( 50.,14.)(65.,3.)(0.,)/straight+1 ( 55.,14.0)[b]@xmath16    ( 50.,-7.0)(65.,3.0)(0.,)/straight-1 ( 55.,-10.0)[b]@xmath17    ( 65.,3.)(85.,3.0)(0.,)/scalardash0 ( 75.,10.)[t]@xmath10    ( 100.,14.)(85.,3.0)(0.,)/scalardash0 ( 95.,17.)[t]@xmath10    ( 100.,-7.)(85.,3.0)(0.,)/scalardash0 ( 95.,-7.)[t]@xmath10    ( 222,204)(3,4.3 )    ( 115.,14.)(130.,3.)(0.,)/straight+1 ( 120.,14.0)[b]@xmath16    ( 115.,-7.0)(130.,3.0)(0.,)/straight-1 ( 120.,-10.0)[b]@xmath17    ( 130.,3.)(150.,3.0)(0.,)/scalardash0 ( 140.,10.)[t]@xmath10    ( 165.,14.)(150.,3.0)(0.,)/scalardash0 ( 160.,18.)[t]@xmath21    ( 165.,-7.)(150.,3.0)(0.,)/scalardash0 ( 160.,-7.)[t]@xmath22    the thermally averaged annihilation cross sections corresponding to these diagrams are given by : @xmath48\\eta_n^2 k^2   ( 2 \\xi_s -\\eta_n)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\xi_n^3 ( 2 \\xi_s -\\eta_n)^3 \\eta_n k    % % @ \\bigg ) \\nonumber \\\\",

    "@xcite have found masses in the range of approximately 7 to 24 tev consistent with @xmath64 .",
    "this range is somewhat artificial , however , depending on the range over which parameters were allowed to vary .",
    "in a previous study of the hess galactic center source @xcite , it was found that the a wimp with a mass in the range of 12 to 29 tev could reproduce the observed spectrum , with the best fit occurring for 19 tev .",

    "@xmath35 annihilations can also produce pairs of charged higgs bosons .",

    "of course this depends on the fraction of @xmath35 annihilations that go to charged higgs pairs . from eqns .",
    "[ nn ] and [ hh ] , we can see that annihilations to either @xmath70 or @xmath71 can dominate , for appropriate choices of parameters . for annihilations to @xmath71 ,",
    "approximately half of which produce @xmath72 final states , we can expect an important contribution from final state photons .",
    "annihilations to @xmath70 do not produce charged higgses , as they mix only into neutral states . in figure  [ spec ] , we show the spectrum of gamma - rays predicted for annihilations of @xmath35 s without a charged higgs contribution ( solid ) and with 50@xmath73 of annihilations producing a charged higgs pair ( dashed ) .",
    "we have used @xmath74 gev and @xmath75 gev , although our results depend very weakly on these choices .",
    "the spectra were generated using pythia @xcite as implemented in the darksusy package @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray spectra predicted from messenger dark matter annihilations can provide good fits to the hess data .",
    "for the spectra shown in figure  [ spec ] , with @xmath76 tev , we find fits with @xmath77 = 1.44 ( solid line ) and 1.20 ( dashed line ) per degree of freedom . for a somewhat lighter wimp with @xmath78 tev ,",

    "the @xmath77 s improve to 1.35 and 1.16 per degree of freedom with and without a charged higgs component , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the presence of final state photons from charged higgs diagrams improves the fit to the hess data considerably .    in all cases ,",
    "the overall normalization of the spectrum was selected to provide the best possible fit to the hess data .    to normalize the gamma - ray spectrum from @xmath35 annihilations ,",
    "the distribution of dark matter near the galactic center must be considered .",
    "unfortunately , the central region of the galaxy is dominated by baryons , so observations of rotation curves reveal little about the distribution of dark matter in this region .",
    "furthermore , simulations have limited resolution and have difficulties predicting the structure of dark matter halos below the kiloparsec scale .    with these reservations in mind",
    ", we will discuss some possibilities for the dark matter distribution in the central region of our galaxy .",
    "perhaps the most popular class of distributions are those found by groups using n - body simulations .",
    "these include the well known navarro frenk and white ( nfw ) @xcite and moore _",
    "@xcite profiles .",
    "these distributions display a dark matter cusp in the central kiloparsecs of the galaxy with the behavior @xmath79 with @xmath80 and 1.5 for the nfw and moore _",
    "_ profiles , respectively .",
    "these n - body simulations do not include the effects of baryons on the dark matter distribution , however .",
    "in particular , it has recently been argued that the cooling of baryons in the inner kiloparsecs of our galaxy will compress the dark matter distribution , resulting in considerably higher densities of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the conclusions drawn regarding this process , called adiabatic compression , are still somewhat controversial , however .",
    "thirdly , the presence of a @xmath81 solar mass black hole present at the dynamical center of our galaxy has lead some to argue that the accretion of dark matter onto this body could generate a density spike with @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "others have challenged this conclusion , however @xcite .    the gamma - ray flux produced in the annihilations of dark matter particles near the galactic center",
    "is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the angle from the galactic center , @xmath85 is the wimp s annihilation cross section in the non - relativistic limit , @xmath86 is the differential spectrum of gamma - rays produced in each annihilation and @xmath87 is the dark matter density at a distance , @xmath88 , from the galactic center .",
    "the integral is performed over the line - of - sight of the observation .",
    "we can break this expression into two components , one of which depends only on the properties of the dark matter particle and another which depends only on the dark matter distribution .",
    "the second of these factors is given by @xmath89 we can then write @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the average of @xmath92 over the solid angle @xmath93 ( centered on @xmath94 ) . considering the range of masses and annihilation modes discussed in this letter , and a solid angle consistent with the upper limit reported by hess ( @xmath95 steradians ) , we estimate approximately @xmath96 to be the value of @xmath97 required to generate the observed flux .",
    "the profiles favored by n - body simulations predict considerably smaller values , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the nfw and moore _",
    "profiles , respectively . these could potentially be increased by a factor of 10 to 100 due to adiabatic compression , however , reaching the desired range .",
    "the presence of a dark matter density spike from adiabatic accretion onto the central supermassive black hole could also potentially generate such large values .",
    "the origin of the recently observed multi - tev gamma - rays from the galactic center region is not presently understood .",
    "although astrophysical possibilities have been proposed , annihilating dark matter is another possible explanation .",
    "the most popular dark matter candidates , such as the lightest neutralino in models of supersymmetry , are far too light too account for the very high - energy spectrum observed .    in this letter , we have considered the possibility that stable particles from the messenger sector of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models are the major component of the dark matter of the universe and that the multi - tev gamma - ray spectrum observed by hess is the product of their annihilations .",
    "we find that 20 to 30 tev messenger dark matter matter particles can reproduce the observed spectrum .",
    "the overall flux can be produced only if the density of dark matter is very large in the inner several parsecs of the galaxy , perhaps as the result of adibatic compression of the halo due to baryon cooling or the adibatic accretion of dark matter onto the central supermassive black hole .",
