    "in a recent study @xcite , iber and buljan analyze the following simple yet pedagogically rich problem from the theory of elasticity . a thin flat elastic sheet ( e.g. , a piece of plastic foil )",
    "is rolled into a cylinder ( radius @xmath1 ) and placed between two impenetrable plates which are parallel to each other and to the axis of the cylinder , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the distance @xmath2 between the plates is fixed externally . for @xmath3",
    "the foil acts as a spring exerting a force of magnitude @xmath4 on each of the plates . an interesting property for this kind of spring",
    "is the non - hookean power - law scaling of the elastic force @xcite , @xmath5 , which holds ( as we show here , _ exactly _ ) for @xmath6 .",
    "measuring @xmath4 in this universal scaling regime has been proposed @xcite as a method to determine bending rigidity for such objects as plastic foils , electrical connectors , biological membranes and microtubules , possibly nanotubes and monolayer materials ( e.g. , graphene ) etc .",
    "a lab problem based on measuring of @xmath4 for standard plastic transparency films has been recently given to world s top secondary school physics students at the 41st international physics olympiad ( zagreb , croatia , 2010 ) .",
    "the corresponding mathematical problem of constrained minimization of the foil s elastic energy may seem difficult and hardly illuminating .",
    "existing solution @xcite is based on analytical approximations and numerical finite element optimization while a textbook approach @xcite relies on force equilibrium conditions for strongly bent elastic rods that are rarely covered in standard physics curricula .     a thin - walled elastic tube deformed between two parallel plates .",
    "the thick black contour line marks the profile at the critical value of @xmath7 , thinner lines above and below correspond to different @xmath8 between @xmath9 and @xmath10.,width=245 ]    in this paper we formulate and solve the variational problem using tangential angle parametrization of the profile shape .",
    "this reveals equivalence to another conceptually rich physics system  the large - amplitude pendulum : elastic energy of the foil maps onto kinetic energy of the pendulum while the fixed inter - plate distance translates into the cosine - shape potential energy .",
    "simple mechanical considerations allow us to deduce the exact inverse squares law for the elastic force at @xmath11 . using the standard solution for the large - amplitude pendulum in terms of elliptic functions , we find ( a ) the exact values for @xmath12 and related constants ; ( b ) a single transcendental equation that determines @xmath4 for @xmath13 ; and ( c ) compact analytic form of the universal profile .",
    "finally , the deduced functional dependence @xmath4 is compared to measurements on a plastic film in the table - top setup used in ref .  .",
    "this show feasibility of a quantitative demonstration of both the universal non - hookean law for @xmath11 and the usual linear regime for @xmath14 .",
    "specific property of the deformation geometry in this problem is `` cylindricity '' : the gaussian curvature vanishes at every point .",
    "this eliminates non - uniform stretching / compression (  14 of ref .  ) and leaves only the bending contribution to the total elastic energy @xmath15 for thin sheets ( thickness @xmath16 ) .",
    "the problem is essentially one - dimensional and the energy functional is the same as for an elastic filament ( kirchhoff rod , see  18 of ref .  ):",
    "@xmath17 ( this effects of gravity are ignored . ) here @xmath18 is the bending rigidity , @xmath19 is the bulk young modulus of the foil material , @xmath20 is the poisson ratio , @xmath21 is the length of the cylinder in the non - deformed direction ( i.e.  parallel to the axis ) , and @xmath22 is the planar curvature of the deformation profile in the plane normal to the axis ( @xmath23-@xmath24 plane ) .",
    "the shape of the profile is described using natural parametrization @xcite @xmath25 in the coordinate system defined in fig .",

    "is expressed by requesting that the vertical coordinate of point @xmath30 is @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig15]a ) , @xmath32    in the following we find the minimum of @xmath15 subject to the constraint and taking into account impenetrability of the plates .",
    "the elastic force is then obtained from @xmath33 .",
    "an intrinsic quantity characterizing the shape of a planar curve is its tangential angle @xmath34 defined as @xmath35 ( dot denotes derivative with respect to @xmath27 ) .",
    "particular advantage of employing @xmath34 for the present problem is that the ( signed ) curvature equals @xcite to simply @xmath36 . integrating @xmath37 over the right half of the profile between the contact points @xmath26 and @xmath30 gives the expression of the constraint in integral form : @xmath38    at the points of contact between the foil and the plates , the tangent to the profile must be parallel to the @xmath24-axis , hence the boundary conditions for @xmath34 , @xmath39    a standard way of turning a constrained optimization problem to an unconstrained one is the use of lagrange multipliers . in our problem both the target function @xmath40 and the constraint are expressed as integrals ( functionals ) of the unknown function @xmath34 .",
    "denoting the lagrange multiplier for eq .   by @xmath41 ( for reasons that will become clear shortly ) and using left - right symmetry in eq .  , the variational problem becomes that of unconstrained minimization with respect to a function @xmath34 and a number @xmath42 of the following functional @xmath43 \\",

    "viewing @xmath45 as dynamical action and @xmath27 as time , one recognizes in eq .   the lagrange function of a rigid pendulum in uniform gravitational field with the angular frequency of _ small _ oscillations equal to @xmath46 ( see schematic drawing in fig .  [ fig : fig15]b ) . in the pendulum problem",
    ", @xmath47 is the angle of deviation from the stable equilibrium which must satisfy the newton s equation ( euler - lagrange equation of the variational problem ) , @xmath48 in standard mechanics problems @xmath46 is usually given , and the fulfillment of the boundary conditions is ensured by choosing the appropriate initial velocity @xmath49 which is a function of @xmath46 . in our case , both @xmath46 and @xmath50",
    "are not known _ a priori _ and must be determined by satisfying both the boundary conditions and the constraint .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath42 is proportional _ the elastic force itself _ since , after `` integrating out '' the pendulum degree of freedom [ i.e.  substituting @xmath34 in the lagrange function with the solution to the equation of motion ] , @xmath51 satisfies @xmath52 and thus @xmath53 we shall use this neat property of lagrange multipliers for the calculation of @xmath4 .    before tackling the problem of finding @xmath50 and @xmath46 ( which is mostly mathematical )",
    ", we develop physical arguments for the universal scaling behavior which constitute , in author s opinion , the most important message of this article .",
    "qualitatively , @xmath55 starts from the value of @xmath56 and decreases as @xmath29 is decreased . at a ceratin critical ( in the sense of separating two qualitatively different behaviors ) @xmath57 the contact curvature vanishes , @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding pendulum problem becomes that of free oscillations with amplitude @xmath59 and frequency @xmath60 ( `` critical pendulum '' ) .",
    "period of these oscillations is well - known @xcite [ also derived below as a special case of eq .",
    "] , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "since according to eq",
    ".   it must be equal to @xmath63 , we get @xmath64    when @xmath29 is decreased further below @xmath12 , an extra condition not accounted for by the lagrangian formulation becomes relevant : the plates do not allow the foil to bend outwards , thus @xmath50 remains zero also for @xmath65 . in order to accommodate the imposed small values of @xmath29 without violating the rigid plates , a finite part of the foil in the vicinity of @xmath66 and @xmath67 must remain flat , @xmath68 ( these parts are marked by horizontal dashed lines in the profiles shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "concurrently , the sections of the profile that do bend obey newton s equation , although with some @xmath69 .",
    "assuming continuity in @xmath70 , we conclude that the deformed part of the profile for @xmath11 must start with @xmath71 ( same as for @xmath57 ) but cover a length shorter than the full length @xmath72 of the foil cross - section .",
    "this shortening of the deformed part can only be accommodated by a faster pendulum since the frequency @xmath73 of the latter remains the only adjustable ( i.e.  @xmath29-dependent ) parameter in the problem for @xmath11 .",
    "( the other parameter , @xmath50 , is pinned to zero by the presence of a finite flat part . ) but , according to eq .  , changing @xmath46 results in a _ uniform _ rescaling of the arc length parameter @xmath27 , therefore the bent parts of the profile at @xmath11 ( marked by curved lines between the plates in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) must be _ geometrically similar _ to the corresponding halves of the critical profile at @xmath57 ( marked with a thick contour in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .    having",
    "established that the _ critical _ profile shape is also _ universal _ ( in the sense of being applicable to any @xmath11 ) , we can determine the scaling law for the force using simple dimensional considerations .",
    "scaling of @xmath29 and @xmath1 with @xmath8 fixed does not change the overall shape of the profile  the tangential angle @xmath47 remains the same function of @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the elastic energy can be written as @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a dimensionless function of @xmath8 .",
    "for @xmath11 the flat parts of the profile do not contribute to the energy .",
    "the curved parts are similar to the critical profile but @xmath77 times smaller , thus their energy must have a fixed @xmath78 and rescaled @xmath79 .",
    "this argument proves exact scaling for the energy , @xmath80 , and , consequently , the force , @xmath5 for @xmath11 .",
    "the prefactor in the scaling law can be described as follows : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and eqs .   and",

    "it has been suggested @xcite that at @xmath122 profiles with a slight curvature in the horizontal part may provide a better solution than a `` stadium '' with completely flat segments .",

    "[ fig : fig15]c ( the concave segments @xmath123 and @xmath124 are exaggerated )",
    ". the following argument shows , however , that any four - contact - point profile will have larger bending energy than the optimal profile with straight @xmath125 and @xmath124 .",
    "let us fix the positions of the contact points on the profile , e.g. , by gluing the foil to the plates at @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 , the curvature @xmath130 must be the same at all of these four points due to symmetry ; furthermore , @xmath130 is evidently positive .",
    "thus the strongly curved parts @xmath131 and @xmath132 must conform to our solution for @xmath133 with a smaller @xmath1 , adjusted to their respective shorter lengths .",
    "consider now increasing slightly the lengths of @xmath131 and @xmath132 while making @xmath134 and @xmath135 shorter so that the total circumference of the profile remains the same . in this new configuration the energy of the segments @xmath134 and @xmath135",
    "will evidently be reduced by shortening . however , the corresponding lengthening of the segments @xmath131 and @xmath132 shall _ also reduce _ their energy : for fixed @xmath29 , longer ( higher @xmath1 ) two - point profiles have _ lower _ minimal total energy .",
    "this can be shown explicitly using eqs .  , , and : @xmath136 thus one can always lower the bending energy of a four - point profile like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig15]c down to the point where @xmath134 and @xmath135 become completely flat and can no longer be shortened .",
