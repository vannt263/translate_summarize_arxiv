    "polynomial basis_. multiplication with respect to this basis is more efficient when the number of terms in @xmath7 is small .",
    "in addition , multiplication will be more efficient if @xmath7 has the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is small . for a trinomial , we would like @xmath23 to be small , and for a pentanomial , we would like @xmath24 to be small .",
    "it is also desirable to be able to compute the trace quickly .",
    "now @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "thus , trace is especially easy to compute if @xmath27 has a single element .",
    "ahmadi and menezes @xcite showed that if @xmath3 is odd , then @xmath28 if and only if @xmath29 contains only monomials of odd degree .",
    "they computed irreducible trinomials and pentanomials with this property ( @xmath23 odd for a trinomial , and @xmath30 odd for a pentanomial . ) to their surprise , @xmath24 seemed to be always small when @xmath6 , but @xmath31 when @xmath8 .",
    "this article explains their observation : we prove that if @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then @xmath16 has an _ even _ number of irreducible factors , and so it can not be irreducible .",
    "more generally , we prove :    .",

    "our theorem is closely related to work of fredricksen , hales , and sweet @xcite . the first theorem in their paper , when specialized to @xmath48 , yields a weak form of this theorem , namely that for @xmath3 odd and @xmath49 , the parity of the number of factors of @xmath21 is a periodic function of @xmath3 , with period  8 .",
    "this section gives background on resultants which will be needed for the proof of the theorem .",

    "it will be handy to note that if @xmath77 then we can pad @xmath78 with leading zeros ( thereby increasing @xmath23 and allowing @xmath79 ) without affecting the determinant of the above matrix .",

    "further , the stickelberger - swan theorem will imply that @xmath7 has an odd number of irreducible factors if and only if @xmath95 .",
    "we compute @xmath96 using the properties of discriminants and resultants given in section  [ discsec ] .",

    "we will prove that @xmath105 this will imply @xmath106 .",

    "unfortunately , lemma  [ general ] is technical and unenlightening .",
    "for this reason , we include two simpler lemmas which imply special cases of the theorem .",

    "in this section we provide the lemmas which were promised at the end of the preceding section .",

    "consider the expansion of @xmath126 .",
    "the principal diagonal contributes @xmath127 .",
    "we claim all other terms are 0 mod  8 .",
    "indeed , a nonprincipal summand contains some @xmath122 with @xmath124 .",
    "if it also contains @xmath128 then the summand is @xmath129 .",
    "if not then the summand contains some @xmath130 from the @xmath131th row and @xmath132 from the @xmath133th column , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are distinct ; but in that case the summand is again @xmath129 since it contains the product of at least three off - diagonal entries .",
    "first we prove ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the resultant @xmath145 is the determinant of an @xmath146 matrix of a special shape ; we will take advantage of this to show that its determinant is @xmath147 .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath148 , @xmath149 the matrix looks like : @xmath150 where @xmath27 denotes an integer which is @xmath147 , @xmath151 denotes any integer , 2 denotes any even integer , 4 denotes any integer which is divisible by 4 , and 0 denotes any integer which is divisible by 8 .",
    "there are @xmath152 4 s , @xmath152 2 s , and @xmath153 * s in each of the first @xmath152 rows .",
    "let @xmath154 denote this matrix , and @xmath155 its image in @xmath121 .",
    "since @xmath156 , it suffices to consider the entries as belonging to @xmath121 .",
