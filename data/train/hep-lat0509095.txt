    "qcd at finite baryon - number density and temperature was present in the early universe and is produced in relativistic heavy - ion colliders .",
    "qcd at finite baryon - number density and zero temperature describes nuclear matter , such as is found in neutron stars .    because qcd at a finite chemical potential @xmath3 for quark number has a complex determinant ,",
    "standard simulation methods , based on importance sampling , fail . at small @xmath3 , in the neighbourhood of the finite temperature transition ,",
    "various approaches have been devised to circumvent these problems .",
    "these methods include reweighting @xcite , analytic continuation @xcite and series expansions @xcite .",
    "we adopt a simpler approach and simulate with at a finite isospin chemical potential @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to simulating with finite quark - number chemical potential @xmath4 using only the magnitude of the fermion determinant and ignoring its phase . for @xmath3",
    "sufficiently small , this phase is well enough behaved on the sizes of lattice needed for the simulations , that one might expect that the position and nature of the transitions at finite @xmath3 and those at finite @xmath0 should be the same .    for 3 flavours of quarks , at zero chemical potentials , there is a critical mass @xmath5 such that the finite temperature transition is first order for @xmath6 , second order in the 3-d ising model universality class at @xmath7 and becomes a crossover for @xmath8 @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "here it was expected that , as @xmath9 or @xmath10 was increased , @xmath5 would also increase , providing a critical endpoint at some small chemical potential .",
    "we are performing simulations with @xmath11 close to @xmath5 on @xmath12 and @xmath13 lattices .",
    "what we find is that the fourth order binder cumulants , which are used to determine the nature of the transition , are very sensitive to the updating increment @xmath1 used in the hybrid molecular - dynamics ( r algorithm ) simulations @xcite when this dependence is taken into account , @xmath14 compared with previous estimates of @xmath15 . in addition we have determined that the binder cumulants have very little @xmath0 dependence .",
    "thus , as yet , we have obtained no evidence for a critical endpoint .",
    "both these observations are in agreement with the new results of de forcrand and philipsen @xcite .    in section  2",
    "we describe our simulations and presents our results .",
    "discussions and conclusions are presented in section  3 .",
    "the staggered quark action for lattice qcd at finite @xmath0 is @xmath16\\chi      + i\\lambda\\epsilon\\bar{\\chi}\\tau_2\\chi\\right\\}.\\ ] ] which yields a real positive fermion determinant .",
    "we simulate this theory with 3 flavours of light dynamical quarks on @xmath12 and @xmath13 lattices using hybrid molecular - dynamics ( r algorithm ) methods , in the viscinity of the finite temperature transition .",
    "since we are interested in small @xmath0 ( @xmath17 ) we set @xmath18 .",
    "we run at several quark masses in the range @xmath19 , that is , close to the critical mass .",
    "the position of the transition is determined by the minimum of the fourth - order binder cumulant @xcite for the chiral condensate , defined by @xmath20 where the overline indicates an average over the lattice .",
    "5 noisy estimators of @xmath21 are made at the end of each trajectory , which yields an unbiased estimator for @xmath22 .",
    "we have checked that this method for determining the position of the transition produces an estimate which is consistent with the position of the maximum of the corresponding susceptibility .",
    "this measurement is obtained by simulating at typically 4 values of @xmath23 in the neighbourhood of the transition for a given mass , @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 ) , and continuing to the minimum using ferrenberg - swendsen reweighting @xcite .",
    "these simulations are usually 160,000 length-@xmath24 trajectories long for each @xmath25 .",
    "because @xmath26 depends strongly on the updating increment @xmath1 , we have performed simulations for several different @xmath1s in the range @xmath27 for each @xmath28 .",
    "figure  [ fig : b4 m ] shows the binder cumulants as functions of mass for the various @xmath1 values used , for our @xmath29 runs .",
    "as we can see , the @xmath1 dependence is considerable . at the critical mass",
    ", @xmath26 should take the ising value ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "if we estimate this from our @xmath31 simulations we would conclude that @xmath32 .",
    "if on the other hand we use our @xmath33 runs we predict @xmath34 .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig : b4mu ] shows the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath26 for @xmath35 over the range @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) , also on a @xmath13 lattice .",
    "what we see is that , for larger @xmath1 values , @xmath26 appears to decrease with increasing @xmath0 , which would lead us to the erroneous conclusion that there was a critical endpoint where @xmath26 passes through the ising value for some @xmath38 . as @xmath39 , this falloff becomes less pronounced , and there is even the possibility that @xmath26 increases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "thus we find no evidence for a critical endpoint .    in figure",
    "[ fig : m035mu0 ] , we plot the values of @xmath26 at @xmath35 and @xmath40 against @xmath41 . from this",
    "it is clear that , at the smallest @xmath1s , @xmath26 is close to its @xmath42 value .",
    "as we go to larger @xmath1 , @xmath26 decreases making the transition appear more abrupt , i.e. less like a crossover and more like a first - order transition .",
    "also included in this figure are the chiral susceptibilities , showing their strong @xmath1 dependence . these increase with increasing @xmath1 , again making the transition appear more abrupt .",
    "the transition @xmath43 , @xmath44 and hence the transition temperature decrease slowly as @xmath0 is increased .",
    "our best fit to our measurements of the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath44 at @xmath35 from our @xmath33 runs gives @xmath45 this is in reasonable agreement with the estimate at finite @xmath3 of de forcrand and philipsen @xcite , if we make the suggested replacement @xmath46 .",
    "we are performing simulations of 3-flavour lattice qcd , using the hybrid molecular - dynamics ( r ) algorithm , at small isospin chemical potential , close to the finite temperature transition from hadronic / nuclear matter to a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the quark mass is chosen to be close to the critical value for zero chemical potentials .",
    "the @xmath43 and hence temperature of this transition decrease slowly with increasing @xmath0 , in a manner consistent with the decrease with increasing @xmath3 , provided one identifies @xmath47 .",
    "the nature of the transition is determined using binder cumulants for the chiral condensate .",
    "we find that the these cumulants depend strongly on the updating increment @xmath1 , decreasing with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the shift in effective @xmath43 at finite @xmath1 is much larger below the transition than above it .",
    "hence a small change in @xmath43 , which takes the system through the transition , produces a much larger change in the effective @xmath43 .",
    "this in turn induces a larger change in observables , which makes the transition appear more abrupt , which is reflected in a smaller value for @xmath26 .",
    "when this dependence is taken into account , the critical mass is found to be some 20% below previously published values .",
    "this is in agreement with the new results obtained by de forcrand and philipsen using rhmc ( exact ) simulations @xcite .",
    "when we apply the finite @xmath1 corrections to our measurements of the binder cumulants at finite @xmath0 , we find that they show little dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "so far , we find no evidence for the predicted critical endpoint .",
    "this too is in agreement with the work of de forcrand and philipsen , whose new predictions of the nature of the transition at finite @xmath3 obtained from continuations from imaginary @xmath3 also show a weak dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in fact , their predictions suggest that @xmath26 might actually increase with @xmath3 as was suggested by some of our early results .",
    "we are continuing our simulations at a quark mass of @xmath48 which is closer to the newly determined critical mass , and at @xmath49 which appears to be just below the critical value .",
    "we too are converting to the new rhmc algorithm @xcite , which is exact .",
    "that is , it produces results which do not have any finite @xmath1 errors .    if no critical endpoint is found , it will indicate that the critical endpoint , if it exists , is unrelated to that found at zero chemical potentials , as the mass is varied .",
    "we intend to use simulations at finite @xmath0 as a platform for reweighting ( by the fermion phase factor ) to finite @xmath3 .",
    "this has been found to be a better choice than reweighting from zero @xmath3 .",
    "presumably this is because the position of the finite temperature phase transition is the same ( or at least close ) for the 2 theories . in this respect",
    "it has similarities with the method of reweighting from shifted @xmath43 values , used by fodor and katz .",
    "here we expect that new methods for simulating fermions will give us at least stochastic estimators for ( the phase of ) the fermion determinant , removing the burden of exact determinant calculations , which are too expensive .",
    "we thank p.  de  forcrand and o.  philipsen for helpful discussions .",
    "these simulations are being run on the jazz cluster at argonne s lcrc , the tungsten and cobalt clusters at ncsa , and the jacquard cluster at nersc .",
