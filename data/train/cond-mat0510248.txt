    "the low - energy electronic spectrum of a one - dimensional metal is dominated by collective spin and charge excitations  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the behavior of typical metals , that can be understood in terms of independent particle - like excitations usually called quasiparticles .",
    "these predictions are clear and well established .",
    "however , the observation of the luttinger liquid behavior in real systems has proven quite elusive .",
    "one of the reasons for this might be that one - dimensional metals are in principle unstable with respect to the peierls distortion that drives them into an insulating ground state  @xcite .",
    "a possible route to avoid this limitation is the fabrication of metallic chains absorbed on surfaces .",
    "the hope is that the rigidity of the substrate will make the energy cost for the structural distortions too large and , therefore , the one - dimensional chains would remain metallic .",
    "semiconductor surfaces are specially attractive for this purpose .",
    "the existence of an energy gap prevents the coupling of the electronic states of the chain in the vicinity of the fermi level with the substrate .",
    "the one - dimensional character of these states is thus preserved .",
    "it is in this context , that the fabrication of monatomic wires of metal atoms on silicon substrates has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "monatomic wires of gold atoms are spontaneously formed on flat and vicinal si(111 ) surfaces after the deposition of gold in the sub - monolayer regime ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "of particular interest are the vicinal substrates , where gold wires run parallel to each step - edge and the coupling between the chains , and thus the one - dimensional character of the electronic states , can in principle be controlled by changing the miscut angle .",
    "examples of these systems that have attracted much attention in the last few years are the si(557)-au  @xcite and the si(553)-au  @xcite reconstructions .",
    "the photoemission spectra of these surfaces close to the fermi energy are dominated by bands with a strong one - dimensional character that exhibit several interesting phenomena including peculiar splittings associated with the spin - orbit interaction  @xcite ( although first interpreted as signature of spin - charge separation  @xcite ) , fractional fillings  @xcite and metal - insulator transitions  @xcite .",
    "the analogous to these one - dimensional structures in the case of the flat si(111 ) surface is the so - called 5@xmath02 reconstruction .",
    "the deposition of gold in the monolayer ( ml ) range on the flat si(111 ) surface results in a variety of phases @xcite , such as @xmath1r30@xmath2 , 1@xmath01 and 5@xmath02 .",
    "the 5@xmath02 phase occurs at @xmath30.4  ml gold coverage  @xcite .",
    "it was first discovered about thirty years ago  @xcite and has been investigated using many experimental techniques since then .",
    "this includes low energy electron diffraction ( leed ) studies  @xcite , x - ray diffraction  @xcite and x - ray standing wave analysis  @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )  @xcite , angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite and inverse photoemission  @xcite , and high resolution electron microscopy ( hrem ) combined with heavy - atom holography  @xcite .",
    "already the first structural models , based on leed measurements , considered two atomic gold chains per 5@xmath02 unit cell running in parallel  @xcite .",
    "this was later confirmed by hrem  @xcite and seems to be firmly established .",
    "the gold chains run along the @xmath4 $ ] and equivalent directions ( parallel to the @xmath02 periodicity of the unit cell ) .",
    "therefore , three different domains are possible for the 5@xmath02 reconstruction on the flat si(111 ) surface .",
    "single - domain surfaces , necessary for arpes , can be fabricated using vicinal surfaces with a slight cut - off angle  @xcite .",
    "the presence of one - dimensional structures in this reconstruction has also been confirmed by the arpes studies .",
    "early studies found a strong anisotropic signal near the fermi level @xcite , but no evidence of fermi - level crossing for this band was found @xcite .",
    "later studies at low temperature found a one - dimensional band with a strong dispersion along the direction of the gold chains  @xcite .",
    "the top of this band appears near the 5@xmath02 zone boundary and disperses downward , reaching its minimum close the 5@xmath01 zone boundary .",
    "this band has been reported to change its dimensionality from strongly one - dimensional near the fermi energy to two - dimensional at lower energies  @xcite . in these studies a gap of @xmath30.3",
    "ev was also identified for this band .",
    "the presence of this gap and its apparent closing with increasing temperature was related to a peierls instability  @xcite .",
    "more recent arpes results  @xcite , both at low and room temperatures , have been able to identify some additional surface bands . however , the metallic or semiconducting character of the surface is still a matter of debate .",
    "in fact , it has been proposed that the metallic or semiconducting character can depend on the concentration of silicon adatoms  @xcite , and even that semiconducting and metallic segments can alternate along the gold chains in the surface  @xcite .",
    "the stm images are characterized by the presence of bright , irregular protrusions  @xcite , and ",
    "y \"- shaped features  @xcite with a well defined orientation respect to the underlying substrate .",
    "the protrusions have been established to be silicon adatoms  @xcite , which are present on the surface with an optimum coverage close to 1/4 adatoms per 5@xmath02 unit cell .    in spite of all these experimental studies ,",
    "the structure of the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au reconstruction has not been completely established yet .",
    "earlier structural models only considered the adsorption sites of the gold atoms .",
    "many of them could be ruled out on the bases of more detailed stm studies  @xcite and the knowledge of the exact gold coverage  @xcite .",
    "a few more refined models exist  @xcite .",
    "they consider both the position of the gold atoms on the substrate and the rebonding of the silicon atoms in the surface layer .",
    "probably the most detailed structural model proposed to date is the one by marks and plass ( mp )  @xcite .",
    "the mp model is based on a combination off - zone hrem , transmission electron diffraction and heavy - atom holography data .",
    "the first theoretical studies using first - principles electronic structure calculations appeared only quite recently .",
    "this is due to the complicated structure and the large unit cell of the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au reconstruction .",
    "kang and lee  @xcite studied the mp and the hasegawa - hosaka - hosoki ( hhh )  @xcite models using density functional theory .",
    "their main conclusion is that both models fail to reproduce some of the key features of the stm images and the experimental band structures . using a similar methodology ,",
    "erwin  @xcite proposed and studied new structures which are characterized by the presence of the so - called honeycomb - chain silicon structure  @xcite .",
    "one of these models ( the so - called  5@xmath02 \" model ) seems to fulfill many of the constraints imposed by the empirical evidence .",
    "an interesting point raised by erwin is that of the crucial role played by silicon adatoms in the stabilization of the different structures . according to ref .",
    ", the surface energy of erwin s  5@xmath02 \" model is minimized for an optimum adatom coverage in agreement with recent experimental reports  @xcite . for lower adatom coverages other structures compete in stability .",
    "this is a very interesting result which , however , is based on approximate calculations . due to the large size of the supercells necessary to simulate explicitly the effect of the different adatom concentrations , erwin assumed that the main role played by the adatom is to dope the surface with electrons .",
    "he then analyzed the behavior of the total energy as a function of the number of extra - electrons in the substrate , obtaining a minimum for @xmath30.25 electrons per 5@xmath02 unit cell .    in this work",
    ", we present a comprehensive study of the atomic and electronic structure of different models of the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au reconstruction using electronic structure calculations based on the density functional theory .",
    "we have used two different methodologies , the siesta code  @xcite using a basis set of localized atomic orbitals and the vasp code  @xcite using a basis set of plane - waves .",
    "we analyze the mp model  @xcite , the models proposed by erwin  @xcite , and a new model that we found during our structural optimizations .",
    "we study in detail the energetics and the structural and electronic properties of the different models .",
    "we also calculate the change in the surface energy as a function of the content of silicon adatoms for the two most stable models . in order to do so ,",
    "we perform calculations for large supercells containing realistic concentrations of adatoms : 5@xmath04 , 5@xmath06 , and 5@xmath08 supercells .",
    "our new model is the most favorable in the range of low adatom concentrations , while erwin s  5@xmath02 \" model becomes favorable for larger adatom concentrations .",
    "the crossing between the surface energy of both structures occurs close to 1/2 adatoms per 5@xmath02 unit cell , i.e. near the maximum adatom concentration observed in the experiments .",
    "both models , our new structure and erwin s  5@xmath02 \" model , seem to provide a good description of most of the experimental data .",
    "particularly , we find a general agreement between the calculated and measured band structures along the direction parallel to the gold chains .",
    "most of our calculations have been performed using the siesta  @xcite code .",
    "we have used here the local approximation ( lda ) to the density - functional theory@xcite ( the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) has been also used for a few test calculations ) , troullier - martins pseudopotentials@xcite , and a basis set of numerical atomic orbitals obtained from the solution of the atomic pseudopotential at slightly excited energies  @xcite .",
    "we have used an _ energy shift _  @xcite of 200  mev .",
    "the corresponding radii are 5.3 , 6.4 and 6.4 a.u . for the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals of si , 6.2 , 6.2 and 4.5 in the case au , and 5.1 for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states of h. the bidimensional brillouin - zone ( bz ) sampling  @xcite contained 4@xmath04 points for the 5@xmath02 unit cell ( and a consistent sampling for other cells  4 supercells",
    "we have checked that k - samplings with 4@xmath02 and 4@xmath04 points produce almost identical results .",
    "k - samplings with 4@xmath03 and 4@xmath02 points have been used , respectively , for the 5@xmath06 and 5@xmath08 supercells . ] ) and the fineness of the real - space grid used to compute the hartree and exchange - correlation contributions to the total energy and hamiltonian matrix elements was equivalent to a 100  ry plane - wave cutoff .",
    "this guarantees the convergence of the total energy , for a given basis set , within @xmath320  mev / au ( @xmath30.5  mev / @xmath8 ) .",
    "we modeled the surface using a finite slab , similar to that depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab ] . for most calculations the slabs contained three silicon bilayers ( the one at the surface and two underlying silicon bilayers ) plus an additional layer of hydrogen atoms to saturate the silicon atoms in the bottom of the slab .",
    "this removes the surface bands associated to the bottom surface from the energy - range of interest , i.e. from the band - gap region .",
    "we have checked the convergence of the results using thicker slabs for the most stable structural models of the surface .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in all three directions .",
    "a vacuum region of 15     ensures negligible interactions between neighboring slabs . during the structural relaxations",
    "the positions of the silicon atoms in the bottom layer were kept at the bulk ideal positions . unless otherwise stated all other degrees of freedom were optimized until all the components of the residual forces were smaller than 0.04  ev /  . to avoid artificial stresses the lateral lattice parameter",
    "was adjusted to the theoretical bulk value calculated using similar approximations to those utilized in the slab calculations , i.e. the same basis set and grid cutoff , and a consistent k - sampling .",
    "the values are , respectively , 5.48 and 5.42    with double-@xmath9 ( dz ) and double-@xmath9 polarized ( dzp ) basis , to be compared with the experimental value of 5.43   .",
    "due to the large number of atoms ( @xmath370 atoms for typical slabs and up to 273 for the largest ones ) and to the need to perform geometrical optimizations for many different structural models , we have decided to use a dz basis set for silicon in most of our calculations .",
    "this basis set includes two different functions ( i.e. two different radial shapes ) to represent the 3@xmath5 orbitals of si , and another two for the 3@xmath6 shell .",
    "we have tested the performance of this basis set and the other parameters of our calculations using the well known si(111)2@xmath02 adatom reconstruction as a test .",
    "our results using a dz basis and a slab containing three bilayers reproduced very well the results for the geometry and energetics given by previous calculations@xcite .",
    "in fact , using a more complete dzp basis set , which includes a shell of @xmath7 orbitals , or increasing the thickness of the slab ( up to five bilayers ) did not change appreciably the results .    a scalar - relativistic pseudopotential similar to that utilized in ref .",
    "have been used for gold .",
    "the gold basis set included double and polarized 6@xmath5 orbitals ( i.e. two different radial shapes to describe 6@xmath5 orbital plus a 6@xmath6 shell ) and a single 5@xmath7 shell .",
    "we refer to this basis set as dzps - szd .",
    "this basis set was already used in calculations for several gold clusters , where it was shown to lead to results in very good agreement with more complete basis sets  @xcite .",
    "we have also tested that these basis set and pseudopotential yield to the correct bulk lattice parameter and band structure .    in this work",
    "we study the relaxed structures and the energetics of several models of the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au surface reconstruction .",
    "the energy differences between different models are of key importance since we would like to determine the most plausible structures .",
    "whenever it is necessary to compare the energies of structures containing different numbers of silicon atoms , the silicon chemical potential is set to the total energy of bulk silicon at the equilibrium lattice parameter .",
    "this choice is justified by the fact that the surface should be in equilibrium with the bulk .",
    "a summary of our results can be found in table  [ tab : systems ] .",
    "one can see that the relative energies are quite small in some cases .",
    "however , they are larger than the estimated error bar for the total energy ( see above ) . furthermore , the relative energies usually exhibit a faster convergence than the total energy of a single structure .",
    "it is also necessary to check the convergence of the results as a function of the slab thickness and the completeness of the basis set .",
    "table  [ tab : systems2 ] shows the results of these tests for the most stable structures . in one case ,",
    "the slab thickness was increased by one silicon bilayer while , in the other , a dzp basis set was used for the silicon atoms . in both cases",
    "the systems were relaxed .",
    "the results are quite stable against the change of the slab thickness .",
    "in particular , the energy order of the structures is not changed and the variation of the relative surface energies is smaller than @xmath30.5  mev / @xmath8 in all the cases .",
    "the variations with the size of the basis set are somewhat larger . from the results in table  [ tab : systems2 ]",
    "we can estimate an error bar smaller than 2  mev / @xmath8 for the relative surface energies of the different structures calculated using siesta .    in order to check the accuracy of our predictions we decided to perform calculations for some of the systems with another electronic structure code that utilizes a different methodology .",
    "we used the vasp code  @xcite for this purpose .",
    "we used projected - augmented - wave potentials and a well converged plane - wave basis set with a cutoff of 312  ev .",
    "all structures were relaxed ( the equilibrium lattice parameter of bulk silicon obtained with vasp is 5.41   ) . in table",
    "[ tab : systems2 ] we can see some of the results obtained with vasp .",
    "they are in good agreement with the siesta results , especially with those obtained with the more complete dzp basis set .",
    "the order between our more stable models is preserved , although the energy difference is somewhat decreased . in particular ,",
    "the new structural model found in the present work ( model n in tables  [ tab : systems ] and [ tab : systems2 ] ) is confirmed to be the most stable surface reconstruction between those studied here .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the energy associated with the addition and removal of adatoms for a particular structural model seems to be quite independent of the details of the calculation .",
    "the surface bzs of the studied systems are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bzs ]  ( a ) . for the 5@xmath01 system",
    "the bz is a stretched hexagon while , for the remaining periodicities , the hexagons are distorted .",
    "we plot the electronic band structures of the different models along the @xmath10- zb@xmath11-zb@xmath12-zb@xmath13 -m-@xmath10 line ( see the dotted line in fig.[fig : bzs ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "the @xmath10-m path runs parallel to the gold wires in the surface , crossing the 5@xmath02 bz through three different regions .",
    "the m-@xmath10 line is perpendicular to gold wires .",
    "the surface / bulk and main atomic character of the different bands is identified by means of a mulliken population analysis@xcite .",
    "although a dz basis is usually sufficient to obtain a quite good description of the occupied electronic states and the relaxed geometries in silicon systems , the use of a more complete basis set is necessary to describe the unoccupied part of the band structure even at low energies .",
    "for this reason all the band structures shown in the paper are calculated using a dzp basis set and slabs containing three underlying silicon bilayers ( even if the relaxed geometry is obtained from a calculation using a dz basis and/or a thinner slab ) .",
    "finally , the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) images are simulated using the theory of tersoff and hamann@xcite .",
    "in this section we present our results for the different models of the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au surface .",
    "we first focus on the energetics , relaxed geometries , and the electronic band structures .",
    "we then turn our attention to the effect of the different silicon adatom contents and the simulated stm images , which we only analyze in detail for the most stable structural models .",
    "a summary of the relative energies of the calculated configurations , accompanied with a brief description of each of them , can be found in table  [ tab : systems ] .    before starting with the description of the results , it is interesting to point out some brief comments about the concentration of silicon adatoms on the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au surface . a detailed study of the equilibrium situation has recently been performed by kirakosian _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite using stm .",
    "their results indicate that , at equilibrium , only one adatom site is occupied out of every four possible sites , corresponding to a 5@xmath08 adatom periodicity ( if all the adatom sites were occupied we would recover a perfect 5@xmath02 periodicity ) .",
    "the analysis of the adatom - adatom correlation functions obtained from the stm images reveals a strong suppression of those configurations with small adatom - adatom distances , a clear maximum corresponding 5@xmath04 periodicities , and a long range oscillatory tail  @xcite .",
    "this was interpreted in terms of a short range repulsion between adatoms plus a long range interaction term . in ref .",
    ", kirakosian and collaborators showed that the density of adatoms can be increased by depositing additional amounts of silicon reaching an almost perfect 5@xmath04 arrangement of the silicon adatoms .",
    "further deposition of silicon does not create a stable 5@xmath02 adatom structure .",
    "instead the extra silicon atoms decorate the step - edge of the terraces on the surface .",
    "these observations seem to have at least two implications : ( @xmath14 ) the optimal adatom concentration must be certainly lower than one adatom per 5@xmath02 cell and , ( @xmath15 ) the structure of the reconstruction must be stable against relatively large changes of the content of adatoms   since the density of silicon adatoms can be increased by a factor of two without , at least apparently , dramatic structural changes  @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of the energetics of the surface as a function of the adatom concentration by means of first - principles electronic structure calculations is quite complicated .",
    "this is for two main reasons .",
    "first , the energies involved are rather small , which implies the need of very well converged calculations . a more serious limitation , however , is the necessity to use large supercells consistent with the low adatom densities .",
    "for this reason we have concentrated most efforts in the two limiting cases , involving respectively 0 and 1 adatoms per 5@xmath02 cell .",
    "the intermediate concentrations usually require drastic approximations .",
    "for example , erwin  @xcite assumed that the main effect of the adatoms in the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au surface is to dope the gold chains with electrons and studied the energetics of the system as a function of this doping .",
    "here we go a step beyond and present explicit calculations for adatom contents down to 1/4 adatoms per 5@xmath02 cell , consistent with a 5@xmath08 periodicity , which indeed can be reached in experimental conditions  @xcite . due to the large size of these systems we limit this study to our two most stable models , and only use the smaller dz basis set .",
    "we start our investigation of the structure of the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au surface using the model proposed by marks and plass  @xcite from experimental data obtained with heavy - atom holography and high resolution electron microscopy .",
    "we use the label mp@xmath16 for this structure ( see table  [ tab : systems ] ) .",
    "the @xmath17 superscript indicates that the structure contains silicon adatoms saturating some of the silicon dangling - bonds in the structure , what we call `` conventional '' silicon adatoms . a schematic view of this structure , as proposed in ref .",
    ", can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab ] .",
    "it has to be taken into account that , due to the limitations of the experimental techniques , there are several uncertainties and assumptions in this structure . only the atomic coordinates within the surface plane are accurate .",
    "the heights of the atoms over the substrate are only approximately resolved .",
    "the experimental beam error in combination with the size and complexity of the structure also limits the sensitivity to possible subsurface relaxations . as a consequence ,",
    "the experimentally proposed structure only considers the reconstruction of the outermost bilayer and contains limited information about the registry between this surface bilayer and the underlying material .",
    "it is necessary to eliminate these uncertainties before one can undertake any serious study of the electronic structure of the mp@xmath16 model . in order to do this",
    "while preserving all the information originally present in the mp@xmath16 proposal , we started our study by performing constrained relaxations of the structure .",
    "the structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab ] was relaxed using following degrees of freedom : ( @xmath14 ) the height of the different layers and , ( @xmath15 ) the lateral position of the surface layers with respect to the underlying bulk slab .",
    "the grouping of the atoms in different layers given in ref .   only implies approximately equal z - coordinates ( the z - axis is taken here along the surface normal ) .",
    "for this reason , in a second step , the atoms were allowed to relax in the z - direction while keeping their coordinates within the xy - plane .",
    "the resulting geometry preserves the bonding pattern of the original mp@xmath16 proposal , and provides a reasonable initial guess to start our search of the most stable models by performing full structural optimizations .",
    "we now consider in detail some of the structural patterns appearing in the mp@xmath16 model of the surface .",
    "for this analysis we find useful the comparison with the si(557)-au surface , a closely related reconstruction that has been quite well characterized during recent years  @xcite .",
    "the stepped si(557)-au is formed after the deposition of @xmath30.2 monolayers of gold on vicinal ( 111 ) , with the misorientation chosen along the @xmath18 $ ] direction .",
    "the size and orientation of the terraces of the si(557)-au represent an analogous to the flat 5@xmath02 unit cell but including a single silicon step  @xcite . with half the gold coverage than the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au surface , the terraces of the si(557)-au contain only one au wire running parallel to the step edges .",
    "gold atoms occupy silicon substitutional positions in the surface layer .",
    "this is supported both , by recent x - ray diffraction data  @xcite , and density functional calculations performed using a methodology similar to the one utilized here  @xcite , which provide a consistent structural model of the surface .",
    "in particular , the highest stability of the silicon substitutional sites for gold has been unambiguously demonstrated by the _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "for example , the substitutional site was determined to be at least 1  ev / au more stable that adatom - like positions , where gold sits on the surface saturating one of the silicon dangling - bonds , or even @xmath30.5  ev / au more favorable than the adsorption decorating the step edges  @xcite .",
    "it seems , therefore , that the au atoms on the si(557)-au surface exhibit a strong tendency towards three - fold silicon coordination .",
    "gold atoms adapt to this situation without much strain , with typical si - au distances only a few percents larger than the bulk silicon bond length .    in the light of these observations the bonding pattern of some of the gold atoms in the mp@xmath16 model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : slab ] ) seems quite peculiar . in particular , the gold atoms in the chain situated at the left side of the `` gold trench '' ( marked with an l in fig .  [ fig : slab ] ) present a fourfold coordination .",
    "they are connected to three silicon atoms within the surface layer and , additionally , to the silicon atom immediately below .",
    "furthermore , the si atoms neighboring to the mentioned gold atoms ( see atoms @xmath19 and @xmath20 in fig .  [",
    "fig : slab ] ) present an unsaturated dangling bond which might be avoided with a slight structural change .",
    "it is interesting to note that the tendency of the gold atoms to occupy silicon substitutional positions in the top most layer can not help to completely rationalize the structure .",
    "a three - fold bonding pattern of the gold atoms is inherently frustrated by the presence of a surface dislocation . in the mp@xmath16 model",
    "this dislocation is located at the position of the right - hand gold wire ( marked with r in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab ] ) . due to the change of the bonding sequence",
    "there are not three unpaired silicon electrons available for each of these au atoms , but rather two .",
    "therefore , they do not occupy a normal three - fold position and are quite likely to be displaced from the initial symmetric positions after relaxation .",
    "it should be noted that , in principle , the surface dislocation can be moved to different locations . in fact , we will see below that this provides a simple route to generate alternative structural models of the surface .",
    "the comparison between the structure of the si(557)-au reconstruction@xcite and the mp@xmath16 model of fig.[fig : slab ] raises another interesting point . in the case of the si(557)-au surface",
    "the silicon atoms in the proximity of the step edge suffer a considerable rebonding .",
    "they form characteristic silicon structure which has been identified with the so - called `` honeycomb chain '' ( hc ) by several authors  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the silicon hc seems instrumental to understand the stability of the si(557)-au and related reconstructions ( see , for example , ref .  ) .",
    "the silicon hc was initially proposed by erwin and weitering@xcite as the main building - block of the ( 3@xmath01 ) reconstruction induced on si(111 ) by the deposition of metals like ag , li , na , k , mg or ba . the hc structure represents a large disturbance from the usual bonding pattern of silicon .",
    "the stability of the silicon hc stems fundamentally from the formation of a double - bond between two three - fold coordinated silicon atoms on the surface@xcite . in the case of the ( 3@xmath01 ) reconstruction",
    "a further stabilization mechanism comes from the fact that , after the transfer of the valence electrons from the metal atoms , the hc structure becomes electronically closed - shell .",
    "it seems somewhat surprising that the silicon hc structure , common to the ( 3@xmath01 ) and si(557)-au metal induced reconstructions , is absent from the mp@xmath16 model of the si(111)-au-(5@xmath02 ) surface .",
    "indeed the mp@xmath16 model seems to be based on an almost unreconstructed si(111 ) surface with a row of adatoms on top , and the more clear disturbance from this bonding pattern being the presence of a surface dislocation .",
    "we now proceed further with the structural relaxations of the mp@xmath16 system .",
    "it is instructive to focus first on a optimization were only the silicon degrees of freedom are taken into account .",
    "the gold atoms are constrained to remain at their initial coordinates . due to the more directional bonding of silicon",
    "we can expect the structural changes to be simpler to analyze and somewhat less dependent on the particular choice of the initial guess in this case .",
    "besides , as a stronger scatterer , we can assume that the gold positions to be better resolved in the experiment .",
    "the resulting geometry is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mp_plus](a ) .",
    "we observe two main effects . on the one hand ,",
    "the hc configuration clearly emerges .",
    "one of the driving forces behind this rebonding is the movement forward of @xmath19 and @xmath20 atoms in order to form an additional covalent bond with the silicon atoms in the underlying layer .",

    "furthermore , in agreement with the general conclusions of ref .  , neither the stm images nor the band structure of the fully relaxed or the constrained relaxed mp@xmath16 model seem to be in agreement with the experimental information .      as discussed in the previous section , the mp model of the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au surface reconstruction is characterized by the presence of a surface dislocation between one of gold wires and the neighboring silicon atoms .",

    "this is in disagreement with one of the latest and more detailed arpes experiments which suggests that the si(111)-au-(5@xmath02 ) surface is a semiconductor with a band gap of at least 0.2  ev  @xcite .",
    "however , the metallic versus semiconducting character of this surface is still a matter of controversy .",
    "for example , the recent arpes study by himpsel and collaborators finds several metallic bands  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this reference and the scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) data of ref .   indicate that the surface could be composed of alternate metallic and semiconducting regions along the gold wires .",
    "our calculated band structure for the e(5@xmath02 ) model is very close to being semiconducting . just by shifting the s@xmath28 band to higher energies by a few tenths of ev we could obtain a semiconducting surface",
    "this might indicate that the metallic behavior is simply related to the limitations inherent to the local density approximation used here and the very simplified assumption that the monoelectronic eigenvalues can be directly identified with the photoemission peaks . in spite of its metallicity ,",

    "this band appears at binding energies between @xmath30.2  ev and @xmath31.3  ev .",
    "following erwin  @xcite , we can try to identify this band with our s@xmath29 band , whose maximum appears close to e@xmath30 in the neighborhood of zb@xmath11 .",
    "however , it becomes difficult to follow the dispersion of this surface band as we move to higher binding energies for two reasons : _",
    "i ) _ the band enters the region of the projected bulk bands , becoming a surface resonance and , _ ii ) _ other surface bands coming from the same region of the surface appear in the energy interval between -0.5 and -1.2  ev .",
    "this last point is widely consistent with the experimental data in ref .  , where three additional bands are identified for binding energies larger than 0.5  ev .",
    "losio and collaborators  @xcite reported an interesting effect , a continuous dimensionality transition of the main surface band .",
    "the character changes from strongly one - dimensional at the band maximum ( i.e. only dispersing in the direction parallel to the gold wires ) to two - dimensional at its minimum ( i.e. with a non - negligible dispersion also in the perpendicular direction ) . the strong one - dimensional character of the surface states close to e@xmath30 has also been confirmed in the most recent arpes measurements  @xcite .",
    "the dispersions in the direction perpendicular to the wires can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : e5x2b ]  ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the band widths are rather small for most surface bands .",
    "an effect similar to the reported dimensionality transition can be seen in the case of the s@xmath28 band .",
    "it is tempting to assign the experimentally observed effect to the s@xmath29 band ( see the different dispersion of bands s@xmath29 in panel ( b ) and s@xmath32 in panel ( c ) ) . however , as commented above it is not so simple to follow the s@xmath29 band as it disperses downwards .",

    "also the energy position of the band s@xmath32 ( @xmath3 - 0.5  ev ) is quite far from the @xmath3 - 1.3  ev found experimentally for the band minimum .",
    "therefore , in contrast to erwin  @xcite we conclude that our calculated band structure for the e(5@xmath02 ) model does not provide a direct explanation to the observation by losio _",
    "et al._.    similarly to the surface bands of the e(5@xmath01 ) model , the s@xmath28 , s@xmath29 bands in fig .",

    "the two dispersive s@xmath29 and s@xmath33 bands have a stronger weights in the other siau bonds , which have a larger overlap and , therefore , present a stronger dispersion .",
    "we now explore the role of the silicon adatoms in these structures .",

    "it is interesting to note that the role of the silicon adatoms in such positions is indeed not very clear .",
    "the stability of the adatoms in typical silicon reconstructions stems from the fact that each adatom can saturate three dangling bonds in the surface at the expense of creating just an additional dangling bond .",
    "the energy gained in this process usually overcomes the strain energy caused by the addition of the adatoms . however , the e(5@xmath01 ) model in fig .",
    "[ fig : e5x1 ]  ( a ) does not have silicon dangling bonds .",

    "finally , after several hundreds of optimization steps this model spontaneously relaxed into a new structure .",
    "this structure , labeled n@xmath16 in table .

    "we do not find any evidence of an energy minimum as a function of the adatom concentration .",
    "this is in contrast with the suggestion made by erwin in ref .  .",
    "in that reference the addition of adatoms was studied using the following simplification : it was assumed that the sole effect of the adatoms is to dope the gold chains with electrons and the energy of the system was studied as a function of the doping .",
    "erwin found a minimum of the total energy for 0.5 extra electrons per 5@xmath02 unit cell .",
    "since each adatom was found to donate two electrons to the surface , this would correspond to the observed adatom concentration at equilibrium of @xmath71 .",
    "however , our simulations introducing explicitly the adatoms in the structure do not confirm this behavior .",
    "the surface energy of the e(5@xmath02 ) structure always decreases as the adatom concentration is increased .",
    "however , the slope of the curve becomes very small for intermediate adatom concentrations , showing a weak dependence of the surface energy in that region .",
    "we can not completely rule out the presence of a minimum for the surface energy at very low adatom concentrations .",
    "however , it seems quite unlikely looking at fig  [ fig : adatoms ] .",
    "it could also be argued that the dz basis set is not flexible enough to produce the correct behavior .",
    "this seems quite improbable looking at the data in table  [ tab : systems2 ] , which clearly show that the energy changes induced by the addition of adatoms are weakly dependent on the details of the calculation .    in the case of the new model",
    "n , the fig .",
    "[ fig : adatoms ] shows that the surface energy systematically increases as a function of the adatom concentration . with the dz basis set",
    "the n model is always more stable than the e(5@xmath02 ) structure . using a more complete basis set and a converged plane - wave calculation we find a crossing : the new model is always more stable at low adatom coverage , but becomes unstable compare with the erwin",
    " 5@xmath02 \" model at larger coverages . scaling the data calculated with the dz basis set to reproduce the vasp results at the end points ( i.e. @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) we can estimate that the crossing occurs at @xmath741/2 .",
    "we can conclude then that the n model is , at least in the framework of density functional calculations , more favorable than the e(5@xmath02 ) model for adatom concentrations below @xmath31/2 adatoms per 5@xmath02 cell .",
    "the stm images of the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au surface are characterized by the presence of bright  protrusions \" and  y \"- shaped features with a definite orientation respect to the underlying lattice  @xcite .",
    "it seems quite well established that the protrusion correspond to silicon adatoms  @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the  y \"- shaped features is less clear .    figures  [ fig : e5x4stm ] and [ fig : n5x4stm ] present our simulations of the stm images for the e(5@xmath02 ) model at -0.8  ev sample bias and the n model at -0.6  ev , respectively .",
    "the simulations have been performed for a 5@xmath04 arrangement of the silicon adatoms , corresponding to concentration of adatoms that can be actually reached in the experiment . in agreement with ref .   and the experiments the silicon adatoms show as very pronounced bright protrusions .",
    "with the adatoms directly sited on the gold chains , the bright spots appear in the middle of the underlying row structures for the e(5@xmath02 ) model . for the n model",
    "they appear in a more lateral position .",
    "this seems to be in somewhat better agreement with the experimental images ( see , for example , the figure  1  ( b ) in ref .  ) .",
    " y \"- shaped features can be identified in the simulated stm images of both n and e(5@xmath02 ) models .",
    "the possible candidates have been highlighted in the figures  [ fig : e5x4stm ] and [ fig : n5x4stm ] ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the identification is , however , more clear in the case of the less symmetric e(5@xmath02 ) structure .",
    "we have performed a systematic study of different models of the si(111)-(5@xmath02)-au surface reconstruction by means of first - principles density - functional calculations using the siesta  @xcite and the vasp  @xcite codes .",
    "we start our investigation with the structural model proposed by marks and plass  @xcite ( mp ) .",
    "this is the most detailed model of this surface reconstruction solely based on experimental information to date .",
    "therefore , it provides a logical starting point for our study .",
    "we have also considered different variants of the relaxed mp model , including the structures recently proposed by erwin  @xcite , and a new structure found during our simulations . within the computational schemes used here",
    "this new structure is the most favorable energetically , at least in the regime of low concentration of silicon adatoms . in general",
    ", we find a reasonable agreement between our results and those of the two existing theoretical studies of the surface  @xcite .",
    "the energy differences between different models are quite small , with most structures lying in a narrow range of surface energies of less than 10  mev / @xmath8 ( the estimated error bar for our energies is of the order of 1 - 2  mev / @xmath8 ) .",
    "this , together with the uncertainties arising from the use of the local approximation to the density functional theory , make difficult to draw definitive conclusions solely based on the energetics .",
    "the comparison of the calculated band structures and local density of states , respectively , with the available arpes data  @xcite and the stm images  @xcite becomes then instrumental in order to identify the most plausible candidates for the equilibrium structure . in the following we summarized some our main conclusions :    _ i ) _ like in the case of the reconstructions formed by the deposition of gold on stepped silicon surfaces  @xcite , the silicon honeycomb chain ( hc )  @xcite structure emerges as a fundamental building block of the reconstruction . in agreement with the result of hang and lee  @xcite",
    ", the silicon hc is formed spontaneously during the relaxation of the mp model .",
    "the hc is also present in the optimized geometries of all the other structural models considered in our work .      _",
    "iii ) _ we have studied in detail the models proposed in ref .   by erwin , the e(5@xmath01 ) and e(5@xmath02 ) structures .",
    "the e(5@xmath01 ) model is quite similar to the mp structure : they correspond to two possible positions , at opposite sides of the siau complex , of the surface dislocation present in these structures .",
    "the e(5@xmath01 ) model and its e(5@xmath02 ) variant are energetically degenerate at zero adatom coverage .",
    "however , these two structures show a different behavior against the addition of silicon adatoms : it is always unfavorable for the e(5@xmath01 ) model , while tends to increase the stability of the e(5@xmath02 ) model .    _",
    "iv ) _ we have explored a different position of the surface dislocation : at the center of the siau complex . we arrive in this way to a new structure , the n model .",
    "according to our calculations this new structure is more stable , at least for low coverages of silicon adatoms , than any of the models proposed to date .",
    "the distance between the gold wires in this model is @xmath33   , which seems somewhat small compared to the @xmath33.9  deduced from the hrem measurements  @xcite .    _",
    "v ) _ the calculated band structures of the e(5@xmath02 ) and n models without adatoms are quite similar and appear to be in reasonable agreement with the available arpes data  @xcite . the other models fail to reproduce the main features observed experimentally .",
    "the agreement seems to be particularly good in the case of the n model . according to our analysis the most prominent and dispersive surface bands , named s@xmath28 and s@xmath29 in ref .",
    ", come from the atoms in the siau complex . in the case of the n model",
    "the silicon adatoms tend to adsorb on the silicon part of the surface , i.e. bonded to three silicon atoms in the surface layer . as a consequence ,",
    "the topology and the energy position of these bands are quite insensitive to the coverage of silicon adatoms .",
    "this contrast with the situation found for the e(5@xmath02 ) model . here",
    "the silicon adatoms tend to adsorb directly on the siau complex , thus causing a notable modification of the surface bands that worsens the agreement with the experimental arpes spectra .",
    "_ vi ) _ we have studied the energetics of the e(5@xmath02 ) and the n models as a function of the concentration of silicon adatoms .",
    "contrary to the suggestion of ref .",
    ", we do not find any evidence of a minimum of the surface energy of the e(5@xmath02 ) model as a function of the adatom coverage .",
    "the surface energy always decreases with the addition of adatoms , although the changes are very small in the range of @xmath65 between 1/2 and 1/4 , where @xmath65 is the number of adatoms per 5@xmath02 unit cell . for the n model",
    "the addition of the adatoms is always unfavorable . as",
    "a consequence of this opposite behavior , the e(5@xmath02 ) structure becomes more stable than the n structure in the limit of relatively large adatom concentrations , for x@xmath751/2 ( notice that @xmath68 corresponds to a 5@xmath04 periodicity ) .",
    "according to this picture the exact content of adatoms is instrumental to determine the equilibrium structure of the reconstruction within the range of experimentally realizable adatom coverages .",
    "this introduces a new degree of complexity that should be taken into account when analyzing the experimental information .",
    "in particular , this might be behind the observed phase separation into 5@xmath04 and 5@xmath02 patches  @xcite .",
    "_ vii ) _ the simulated stm images of the most stable models , n and e(5@xmath02 ) , are in broad agreement with the experimental images .",
    "the silicon atoms produce bright spots which are located in the middle of the underlying row structures for the e(5@xmath02 ) and in a somewhat more lateral position for the n model . in both cases",
    " y \"- shaped features similar to those observed in the experiment can be found .",
    "however , they are more clear in the case of the e(5@xmath02 ) model  @xcite where the structure surrounding the gold chains is less symmetric .",
