    "the study of polyacene started long ago in a pioneering paper by kivelson and chapman.@xcite the study performed by these two authors was motivated by the investigations of su , schreiffer , and heeger on polyacetylene.@xcite they@xcite showed that the band structure associated to the @xmath0-orbitals of polyacene is made of four bands , with a valence and a conduction bands touching at the limit of the one - dimensional brillouin zone . since polyacene can be considered the extreme case of a narrow graphene@xcite ribbon it is instructive to compare the band structure of graphene and polyacene . in both cases",
    "one has an electron per carbon atom and in both cases the valence and conduction band touch at the corner of the brillouin zone . in graphene , however , the bands are linear at the @xmath1 and @xmath2 points of the brillouin zone , whereas in polyacene the dispersion relation around the momentum @xmath3 ( @xmath4 the length of the unit cell ) is quadratic . as a consequence",
    ", graphene has a vanishing density of states at the fermi energy whereas polyacene displays a square root singularity .",
    "it was therefore speculated@xcite that the ground state of polyacene could support long range order such as ferromagnetic and superconducting phases .",
    "it was further showed that phonon modes in polyacene can lead to a peierls distortion opening an energy gap at @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite    using a green s function method , rosa and melo@xcite studied the density of states of several distorted configurations of polyacene , including the case where a local defect was present .",
    "they found that the optical response of polyacene should be very different from that of polyacetylene .",
    "the inclusion of many - body effects on the description of the ground state of polyacene was done by garcia - bach _",
    "et al._@xcite using a valence - bond treatment .",
    "they found that the distorted ground state is degenerate . using a projector quantum monte carlo method ,",
    "srinivasan and ramasesha @xcite found , within the hubbard model , that electron - electron correlations tend to enhance the peierls instability . with the development of the density matrix renormalization group ,",
    "the exact study of the ground state of quasi - one - dimensional electronic systems became available .",
    "et al._@xcite studied the ground state of polyacene using the pariser - parr - pople hamiltonian .",
    "as in previous studies they found that strong electron - electron interactions can enhance the dimerization . using a configuration interaction technique , sony and shukla @xcite studied the optical absorption and the excited states of polyacenes also in the framework of the pariser - parr - pople hamiltonian .    as interesting as the ground state nature of carbon polymers are their transport properties",
    "of particular interest to us is the effect of disorder on the electronic tunneling through a portion of a disordered chain . guinea and vergs , @xcite using a green s function method , studied the local density of states and the localization length of a one - dimensional chain coupled to small pieces of laterally linked polymer .",
    "they showed that at the band center there is an exact vanishing of the transmission coefficient due to a local antiresonance .",
    "sautet and joachim @xcite studied , within a one - dimensional tight - binding model , the effect of a single impurity which would change both the on - site energy and the hopping to the next - neighbor atoms .",
    "mizes and conwell @xcite consider the effect of a single impurity in the square polymer , showing that a change on the on - site energy has a more pronounced effect in reducing the transmission in the one - dimensional chain than in the square polymer . at the end of the paper@xcite these authors speculate that for polyacene there should be four active scattering modes instead of two as in the square polymer . as we show in this paper ,",
    "this is not the case because the band structure of polyacene is markedly different from that of the square polymer .",
    "et al . _ @xcite generalized the study of ref",
    ". @xcite by including different types of obstacles as scattering centers .",
    "_ el al . _",
    "@xcite studied the electronic transmission through a conjugate - oligomer using both mode matching and green s function methods .",
    "they found that the transmission through the conjugate - oligomer possesses several transmission resonances .",
    "et al._@xcite studied the transport properties of emeraldine slats using a green s function method , by looking at the effect on the electronic transmission of impurity dimers .",
    "the band structure of very narrow carbon nanoribbons was studied by ezawa .",
    "@xcite the effect on the conductance of the parity of the number of carbon rows across a zig - zag ribbon has been studied by akhmerov _",
    "et al._.@xcite    in this paper we study the effect of disorder on the electronic transmission in polyacene .",
    "this system can be considered the most extreme limit of narrow carbon nanoribbons,@xcite and it corresponds to an odd parity situation studied in ref .",
    "we shall assume that the disorder is limited to a single unit cell .",
    "although this assumption can be relaxed , it allows us however to obtain a full analytical expression for the transmission coefficient . following ref .",
    "@xcite we shall consider both on - site and hopping disorder .",
    "the system is therefore characterized by two semi - infinite perfect leads made of polyacene and a scattering region .",
    "the schrdinger equation has to be solved for the three regions and a mode matching technique , first used by ando @xcite to study the conductance of a square lattice in a magnetic field , will be used here .",
    "although , as discussed above , all the theoretical studies point out that polyacene has a gap at the fermi energy due to phonons and interactions , here we will consider non - distorted polyacene in the independent particle approximation",
    ". it should be relatively simple to generalize the calculations below to include the effect of a gap and the effect of electron - electron interactions ( at least at the mean field level ) , but the only expected modification would be a small region near zero energy where the conductance would be zero due to the presence of the gap .",
    "in addition , the disorder could add states into the gap of polyacene .",
    "the model for disordered polyacene can be written in general terms as @xmath5\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 represents the on - site energy , @xmath7 the hopping between the atoms within the unit cell @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the hopping between atoms in neighboring unit cells .",
    "the sum over @xmath8 runs over the unit cells and the sums over @xmath10 and @xmath11 run over the atoms in the unit cell . in our model",
    "we shall assume that the on - site energies @xmath12 and @xmath13 are different from those of the rest of the atoms in the lattice .",
    "the on - site energies for atoms to the left of these two are all equal to @xmath14 and , for those to the right , to @xmath15 . this difference could be due to a potential bias applied to the system .",
    "the hopping parameters are defined in figs .",
    "[ fig_polyacene ] and [ fig_polyacene_zero_cell ] .",
    "only the hopping energies starting at the atoms 1 and 4 of the zero unit cell are modified .",
    "they are named @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we further assume that the hopping energies between atoms 2 and 3 within a given unit cell ( @xmath18 ) can be different from that between atoms 1 and 2 , or 3 and 4 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions of this problem have the form @xmath20    .",
    "the hoping along the chain is @xmath19 and in the perpendicular direction is @xmath18.,width=264 ]     unit cell , where the disorder is located .",
    "note that the on - site energies for @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) are different from those for @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "also the on - site energy of atoms 1 and 4 in the zero unit cell is different from the rest and equals @xmath25.,width=264 ]    as it is clear from fig [ fig_polyacene_zero_cell ] the problem is divided into three regions : ( i ) that to the left of the zero unit cell , with @xmath26 , representing a semi - infinite ordered lead ; ( ii ) the disordered unit cell at @xmath27 , which will induce the scattering of the electrons ; ( iii ) the right ordered lead , for @xmath28 .",
    "we have therefore to solve the problem in these three regions .",
    "the method we will use was developed by ando@xcite in the context of quantum point contacts in a magnetic field and generalized by khomyakov _",
    "_ to an arbitrary three - dimensional structure .",
    "the strategy of solution is therefore the following , firstly the problem is solved for the pure leads obtaining the eigenmodes . then the scattering problem is solved considering an incoming wave described by one of the eigenmodes at a time .",
    "this allows for the determination of the transmission matrix elements @xmath29 , and from them the calculation of the conductance follows as @xcite @xmath30 where the summation is over propagating channels only .",
    "as explained above , the problem is separated into the solution in the perfect leads and the solution in the scattering region . in what follows",
    "we shall explain how to obtain those solutions .",
    "we study here the scattering channels , i.e. stationary solutions in the asympotic leads assuming these are perfect and infinite .",
    "let us start with the left lead .",
    "the problem for the right one is solved along the same lines but with @xmath14 replaced by @xmath15 .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian for @xmath31 has the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a 4-vector containing the wave - function coefficients of the unit cell @xmath34 .",
    "the matrices @xmath35 and @xmath36 are given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 it is important to note that the @xmath35 matrix is singular , not having an inverse .",
    "this will be important in what follows . as explained by ando , @xcite the problem for the perfect lead",
    "may be solved assuming a bloch relation between the vectors @xmath39 @xmath40 for a general problem the vector @xmath33 has dimension @xmath41 and the solution of ( [ tblead ] ) can be obtained by transforming it into an ordinary eigenvalue equation of dimension @xmath42.@xcite we look for scattering states formed by an incoming wave approaching the scattering region from the left and its resulting outgoing waves .",
    "whether these waves are propagating or evanescent states depends on the nature of the eigenvalues . propagating states",
    "always have @xmath43 , whereas evanescent ones have @xmath44 .",
    "another possibility is to transform eq .",
    "( [ tblead ] ) into a quadratic eigenvalue equation by repeatedly use of eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) , resulting in @xmath45 as before , the determination of the eigenvalues of eq .",
    "( [ tblead2 ] ) will lead , for a problem of dimension @xmath41 , to a polynomial of order @xmath42 whose roots are the sought eigenvalues .",
    "although we can attack the solution of the problem ( [ tblead2 ] ) using the matrices given by eqs .",
    "( [ b ] ) and ( [ h ] ) , it is however convenient to perform a unitary transformation of eq .",
    "( [ tblead2 ] ) .",
    "we define the unitary matrix @xmath46 @xmath47 and introduce the transformation @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . upon this transformation ,",
    "the eigenproblem ( [ tblead2 ] ) is reduced to two block - diagonal quadratic eigenvalue problems , since the resulting transforms of @xmath35 and @xmath50 are factorized into two @xmath51 matrices which we denote generally as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath54 becomes the direct sum of two 2-vectors which we generically refer to as @xmath55 and which we assume normalized .",
    "the resulting eigenvalue problem reads @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 the decoupled two - dimensional problems describe propagation through the even and odd modes with respect to the central axis of the polyacene .",
    "the eigenvalue problem ( [ litle ] ) has the same form as that of a linear chain , with hopping energy @xmath19 between neighboring atoms and with on - site energies alternating between @xmath14 and @xmath59 . as a conclusion ,",
    "the scattering problem in polyacene can be mapped into that of two independent one - dimensional chains , contrary to the expectations of mizes and conwell .",
    "@xcite    from the general discussion above one would expect that the eigenvalue problem ( [ litle ] ) would lead to a quartic polynomial in @xmath60 .",
    "in fact because the matrix @xmath35 has no inverse ( as happens for @xmath52 ) the polynomial is only cubic in @xmath60 . one of the solutions is the trivial one @xmath61 .",
    "this solution has to be disregarded since it would produce a null wave function everywhere .",
    "the other two solutions are @xmath62/2t^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\pm & \\frac 1 2 \\sqrt{[(e-\\epsilon_l)^2+t_\\perp(e-\\epsilon_l)-2t^2]^2/t^4 - 4}\\ , .",

    "the fact that we only have two solutions for each sign of @xmath18 , and not four , means that there are always two of the four expected modes that do not contribute to the transport , not even as evanescent waves .",
