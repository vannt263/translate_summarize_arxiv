    "the origin of a darkgamma - ray burst ( grb ) remains one of the most serious mysteries of long grb ( hereafter just referred as grbs ) phenomena .",
    "a dark grb is characterized by the faintness of its optical afterglow . while the x - ray afterglow is currently well - explored since",
    "the launch of @xmath0 , an optical and/or near - infrared detection is reported in only about half of cases , suggesting the significant fraction of dark events .",
    "this optically dark nature may be attributed to the ( i ) large dust extinction around a grb , ( ii ) attenuation by the neutral hydrogen in the host and/or intergalactic medium due to a high redshift event , ( iii ) intrinsically low luminous event of a small grb fluence , and ( iv ) low - density medium surrounding a grb progenitor .",
    "however , the actual nature of dark grbs has not yet been revealed well .",
    "recently , the metallicity environment of dark grbs is getting a lot more attention .",
    "the low metallicity has been theoretically suggested to be required to produce the rapid rotating progenitors and relativistic explosions associated with grbs . as for observational studies",
    ", @xcite showed that grbs preferentially occur in small faint irregular galaxies .",
    "this suggests the low - metallicity environment around grbs because mass ( or luminosity)-metallicity relation exists among galaxies .",
    "in fact , the low - metallicity nature of grb hosts based on spectroscopic observations are reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared the chemical abundances at the sites of 12 nearby ( @xmath15 ) type ic supernovae ( sn ic ) that showed broad lines , but had no observed gamma - ray burst ( grb ) , with the chemical abundances in five nearby ( @xmath16 ) galaxies at the sites of grbs .",
    "they showed that there is a critical metallicity below which grbs occur in contrast to type ic sne , which occur in more metal rich environment . in this context , @xcite predicted the critical stellar mass of grb hosts , which is a stellar - mass counterpart of the critical metallicity , as a function of redshift , assuming an evolution of the mass - metallicity relation by @xcite and the presence of the critical metallicity @xcite .",
    "they showed that most grb hosts collected by @xcite have stellar masses smaller than or comparable to the critical mass .",
    "there are , however , exceptionally massive hosts at @xmath17 , i.e. , possibly exceptionally high metallicity : hosts of grb 020127 ( @xmath12 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , grb 020819 , and grb 051022 ( @xmath18 0.4 and 0.8 , respectively : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for grb 020819 , @xcite reported metallicity larger than the critical metallicity at the grb position as well as in the host .",
    "in addition , for grb 051022 metallicity of the host is slightly larger than the critical value above mentioned @xcite .",
    "both grbs are classified as dark .",
    "this suggests that high metallicity environment around a grb may be somehow related to its darknature .",
    "therefore , investigating the properties of massive dark grb hosts is a key to reveal the origin of dark grbs .",
    "the @xmath0 burst alert telescope ( bat ) detected the long - duration grb 080325 ( t@xmath19 s ) on 2008 march 25 at 04:10:32 ut with an initial localization of 3@xmath20 radius @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 x - ray telescope ( xrt ) began observing the field at 151.9 s after the bat trigger , and found a bright , uncatalogued x - ray source @xcite .",
    "the enhanced xrt position was reported by @xcite by using 199 s of overlapping xrt photon counting mode with an uncertainty of 2@xmath21.6 radius .",
    "after the trigger , several attempts were made to identify the afterglow in optical and near - infrared wavelength @xcite .",
    "however , no detection of the afterglow or host galaxy has been reported in optical and near - infrared wavelength , suggesting that the grb 080325 is a dark grb . in this paper",
    "we report the successful photometric identification of the afterglow of grb 080325 in near - infrared wavelength and its host galaxy at @xmath12 , and present a case study of properties of the afterglow and its host galaxy of a dark grb .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  [ near - infrared and optical imaging with subaru ] the near - infrared and optical observations and data analysis are presented . in  [ grb 080325 as a dark grb ]",
    "we show the faintness of the optical and near - infrared afterglow of grb 080325 compared with its x - ray afterglow , and dust extinction along the line of sight to grb 080325 .",
    "results of spectral energy distribution fitting analysis of the grb 080325 host and discussion are presented in  [ massive red host galaxy at ] and  [ comparison with other grb afterglows and hosts ] , respectively .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the ab magnitude system and the cosmological parameters of @xmath22 = 71 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 = 0.27 , and @xmath25 = 0.73 .",
    "we observed the grb 080325 field as a part of a target - of - opportunity program with the subaru telescope .",
    "we took images of the field using multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ) in @xmath5 and @xmath1 bands at 8.7 hours after the burst and another set at a day latter .",
    "a standard dithering method was employed during the exposure , with a single exposure of 50 s @xmath26 2 coadds ( first night ) and 40 s @xmath26 2 coadds ( second night ) in @xmath1 band , and with 90 s ( first night ) and 150 s ( second night ) in @xmath5 band .",
    "total exposure times in @xmath5 and @xmath1 bands are 900 s and 3300 s for the first night , and 2250 s and 5040 s for the second night , respectively .",
    "the weather condition was clear for both nights .",
    "seeing sizes were roughly 0@xmath21.6 in @xmath1 band and 0@xmath21.8 in @xmath5 band . a standard star field ( fs27 ) was also observed during the first night at the end of the observation .",
    "the data reduction was performed with the mcsred package ( ver.20080317 ) using all - in - one task ( mcsall ) .",
    "we detected a faint extended object as well as a point - like spot at the northern edge of it in the enhanced @xmath0 xrt error circle @xcite in the first - night @xmath1-band image as shown in figure [ figure1 ] ( a ) . in the first - night @xmath5-band image , although the faint extended object was seen , the northern source was not detected . in the second - night @xmath1-band image ,",
    "the north spot was not detected significantly as shown in figure [ figure1 ] ( b ) . by subtracting the second image from the first image",
    ", the point - like spot can be isolated clearly ( figure [ figure1](c ) ) ; a total magnitude ( the spot and the extended object ) decreased by 0.2 mag .",
    "no significant variation was detected in @xmath5 band .",
    "based on the positional coincidence , the fwhm of the northern spot comparable to a seeing size , and its fading behavior in @xmath1-band , we conclude that the spot in the north is the afterglow .",
    "the coordinates of the afterglow are @xmath27 = @xmath28 and @xmath29 = @xmath30 ( j2000 , uncertainty 0@xmath21.2 ) .",
    "the aperture ( 1@xmath21.2 @xmath31 ) magnitudes of the afterglow at 8.7 hours after the burst are @xmath32 mag and @xmath33 @xmath34 0.18 mag .",
    "we also conclude that the faint extended source just south of the afterglow is the host galaxy of grb 080325 .",
    "the aperture ( @xmath35 @xmath31 ) magnitudes of the host galaxy are @xmath36 mag and @xmath37 mag .",
    "these magnitudes substantially represent total magnitudes because of convergence of growth curves at the aperture size of 2@xmath21.0 in @xmath5 and @xmath1 bands .",
    "the offset distance of the afterglow from the galaxy center ( @xmath38 kpc ) is large among other long grbs , although the offset distance normalized by the half light radius of the host ( @xmath39 = 1.3 ) is a typical value @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that probabilities of a chance coincidence of a foreground / background galaxy are small ; the expected numbers of galaxies brighter than the magnitudes within @xmath40 from the position of the afterglow are @xmath41 in optical bands and @xmath42 in @xmath1-band .",
    "we obtained optical images of the grb 080325 host with subaru / suprime - cam in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 bands on 2009 april 22 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath9 ) and 2009 july 17 ut ( @xmath8 ) to reveal the host properties . the total exposure times for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 bands are 900 s , 360 s , 360 s , and 1200 s , respectively .",
    "the weather condition was photometric and a typical seeing size was about 0@xmath21.6 nearly identical to that of near - infrared images .",
    "the standard data reduction was performed for all images , i.e. , bias subtraction , flat fielding , distortion correction , and sky subtraction using sdfred package constructed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the images were calibrated with observations of sa111 standard stars @xcite .",
    "obtained images are shown in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "we successfully detected the host galaxy with @xmath6 = 25.7 @xmath34 0.11 mag , @xmath7 = 25.5 @xmath34 0.16 mag , @xmath43 = 24.9 @xmath34 0.16 mag , and @xmath44 = 24.5 @xmath34 0.07 mag derived by aperture photometry using a 2@xmath21.0 aperture size .",
    "the magnitude error includes a photometric error of the host galaxy calculated by iraf phot task and a systematic error of a zero point in each band .",
    "all magnitudes described above are corrected for the foreground extinction by milky way @xcite .",
    "no optical and near - infrared detection of the afterglow has been reported other than our detection @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that grb 080325 is a dark grb .",
    "the definition of dark grbs based only on the optical faintness of afterglow , however , is relatively unphysical since the optical detectability of an afterglow strongly depends on instruments , weather conditions , and starting time of follow - up observations .",
    "thus @xcite proposed a criterion based on an optical - to - x - ray spectral index at 11 hours after the burst , i.e. , @xmath45 = log \\{@xmath46(r)/@xmath46(3 kev)}/log ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "if @xmath45 of an afterglow is below 0.5 , the grb is defined as dark . in the simplest fireball models which have been successfully used to interpret the observed properties of grb",
    "afterglows @xcite , @xmath45 is expected to be @xmath48 .",
    "in fact , most of afterglows show @xmath45 between 0.5 to 1.25 as seen in figure [ figure3 ]",
    ". the @xmath45 index would be little affected by the density of the grb environment and the grb luminosity .",
    "this is because these two cases tend to uniformly scale an overall spectrum of an afterglow , resulting in a nearly unchanged @xmath45 value .",
    "based on the x - ray light - curve and spectral analyses of the grb 080325 reported in @xmath0/xrt grb light curveand spectralrepository , the x - ray flux in a @xmath49 kev band at 11 hours was converted to the flux density at 3 kev using the measured x - ray spectral index of @xmath50 . to estimate the @xmath51-band flux density of the afterglow at 11 hours",
    ", we assumed two possible cases of temporal declining index ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) indicated by x - ray light curve of the afterglow .",
    "these indices well agree with a typical index of other x - ray afterglows . by using these temporal indices , the @xmath54-band upper limit measured with the 1.5 m telescope at sierra nevada observatory at 39.46 minutes after the burst @xcite",
    "is extrapolated to two upper limits at 11 hours .",
    "these @xmath54-band upper limits are extrapolated to @xmath51-band upper limits assuming a typical optical spectral index of @xmath55 = 1.0 . as a result , two upper limits on @xmath45 is estimated to be 0.14 and 0.33 ( figure [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "we also confirmed the power - law interpolations between @xmath54-band upper limits and @xmath1 band flux densities at 11 hours result in @xmath45 slightly smaller than these values , assuming above two temporal declining indices ( the power - law indices in this interpolation are @xmath56 = 1.6 and 2.9 for @xmath57 and @xmath53 ) .",
    "therefore , grb 080325 is classified as a dark grb .",
    "given a typical optical spectral index of @xmath58 and the observed @xmath1 magnitude of the afterglow , the expected @xmath5-band magnitude of the afterglow at the first night is estimated to be @xmath59 mag , which is fainter than the @xmath5-band limiting magnitude of the first - night image .",
    "this result is unchanged even if two power - law indices of @xmath56 = 1.6 and 2.9 mentioned above are assumed .",
    "therefore , it is unclear whether large attenuation by dust or intergalactic medium are present or not from the @xmath4 color of the afterglow .",
    "another method to examine the attenuation along the line of sight to the grb is a comparison between flux densities of the x - ray and optical afterglows . as mentioned above , intrinsic(rest - wavelength obscuration - free ) optical - to - x - ray spectral index ( @xmath60 )",
    "is expected to be 0.5 - 1.25 .",
    "if we estimate the intrinsic3 kev flux density of the afterglow ( @xmath61 ) , a possible range of the intrinsic@xmath51-band flux density ( @xmath62 ) can be obtained .",
    "thus , the comparison between @xmath62 and observed rest - wavelength @xmath51-band flux density of the afterglow ( @xmath63 ) enables us to estimate an extinction along the line of sight to the grb .",
    "so as to estimate a possible range of @xmath62 , we obtained the x - ray spectrum of the grb 080325 afterglow averaged from 1 to 16 hours after the burst from the swift / xrt grb spectral repository , and performed spectral fitting analysis as shown in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "the x - ray spectral model includes a fixed extinction by milky way ( n@xmath64 = @xmath65 @xmath66 ) , an extinction to the afterglow of grb 080325 at @xmath67 ( n@xmath68 ) , and a power - law x - ray spectral index of @xmath69 .",
    "the redshift of the afterglow assumed here is based on spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting analysis for the host galaxy described in section [ massive red host galaxy at ] . using the derived best - fit parameters of n@xmath68 = @xmath70 @xmath66 and @xmath69 = 1.2@xmath71",
    ", the x - ray flux in a @xmath49 kev band at 11 hours extracted from x - ray light curve was converted to @xmath72 @xmath73jy .",
    "based on @xmath61 and @xmath60 , we calculated a possible range of @xmath62 . with the calzetti extinction law @xcite , the extinction along the line of sight to the grb",
    "is estimated to be @xmath74 mag @xmath75 mag . if extinction laws for milky way @xcite and smc are assumed , the extinction is @xmath76 mag @xmath77 mag for both cases .",
    "since these values are corresponding to @xmath60 = 0.5 and 1.25 , respectively , we can not exclude the extremely strong dust extinction of @xmath78 mag if @xmath79 is possible , e.g. , there is one exceptional object with @xmath80 as shown in figure [ figure3 ] . as an alternative",
    ", the best - fit result of n@xmath68 = @xmath81 @xmath66 can be converted to @xmath82 assuming a typical ratio of @xmath83 for the local group galaxies ( milky way , smc , and lmc : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in any cases",
    "@xmath2 along the line of sight to the grb is larger than @xmath2 for the entire host derived below .",
    "in order to estimate a redshift and to reveal host properties we made sed fitting for the host .",
    "the stellar properties of the grb 080325 host are examined using the observed multi - band photometry and stellar population synthesis models including emission lines typical for local star - forming galaxies ( p@xmath84gase.2 ) constructed by and @xcite . assumed",
    "star - formation histories ( sfhs ) include ( i ) instantaneous burst , ( ii ) exponentially declining star - formation rate ( sfr ) , i.e. , @xmath85 with @xmath86 = 1 myr , 10 myr , 100 myr , 1 gyr , and 10 gyr , and ( iii ) constant sfr .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) used here is salpeter imf @xcite , and the extinction law is adopted from @xcite .",
    "although we also examined milky way and smc extinction laws , these provided very poor fitting results .",
    "sedfit _ software package ( m. sawicki 2010 , in preparation ) which is essentially the same as that by @xcite .",
    "the sfh of the best - fit stellar population synthesis model is the @xmath86 (= 1 gyr ) declining model ( @xmath87 ) , and the best - fit result and output parameters of the host galaxy are summarized in figure [ figure5 ] .",
    "however @xmath86 = 10 gyr and constant sfr models can also reasonably reproduce the observed sed ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "these models give that the host is at @xmath89 with the best estimate of 1.9 ( see figure [ figure6 ] ) , and the dust extinction is large ( @xmath90 mag , @xmath91 mag ) .",
    "the @xmath92 ( stellar mass for salpeter imf ) , sfr , and age of the host derived from sed fitting are @xmath93 , @xmath94 yr@xmath23 , and @xmath95 gyr , although uncertainties of the sfr and age are relatively large",
    ".    the rest - frame @xmath6-band absolute magnitude is @xmath96 = @xmath97 calculated from the best - fit spectral template .",
    "this magnitude is comparable to @xmath11 at @xmath98 @xcite , or 3 @xmath11 if the @xmath6-band luminosity is corrected for the dust extinction .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure7 ] , the observed color of the grb 080325 host ( @xmath4 = 1.3 mag ) is significantly redder than any other grb hosts at @xmath99 , goods south galaxies with known spectroscopic redshifts and local - galaxy templates ( different line types : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) redshifted to @xmath12 without galaxy evolution except for an elliptical galaxy .",
    "these properties of the host galaxy , i.e. , the luminous dusty ( red - color ) starforming host , are significantly different from those of typical grb hosts previously studied by .",
    "we note that these results do not change even if population synthesis models without including nebular emission lines are examined for the sed fitting analysis .",
    "hereafter , we adopt parameters of the host galaxy derived from the best - fit model with emission lines .",
    "recently @xcite have made a uniform sample of dark grbs . among 29 grb hosts rapidly observed with the plomar 60-inch telescope from @xmath0 burst , they selected 14 dark grbs based on @xmath45 at 1000 s after the burst .",
    "they inferred that a significant fraction of dark grbs occurs in highly obscured regions , although the host galaxies of dark grbs seem to have normal optical colors .",
    "this suggests that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinity of the grb progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the typical dust extinction along the line of sight to dark grbs is 0.5 mag @xmath100 @xmath101 10.0 mag .",
    "the dust extinction along the line of sight to grb 080325 is similar to these values .",
    "however , grb 080325 host is characteristic in the sense that the large extinction is observed both for the entire host and the line of sight to the grb , in contrast to most of other dark grbs which show relatively weak extinction for the whole host galaxies , i.e. , @xmath102 mag @xcite .",
    "another case of dark grb with a large extinction over the whole host galaxy , is grb 051022 .",
    "grb 051022 is classified as dark with @xmath103 , whose host galaxy shows a relatively large dust extinction of @xmath104 mag derived from sed fitting analysis .",
    "the amount of the extinction in the line of sight toward the grb ( @xmath105 mag ) , which is required to suppress the optical afterglow to the observed limits , is clearly higher than the @xmath2 value found from the host sed .",
    "@xcite attributed this significant discrepancy between two values of the dust extinction to the effect of the grb position in the host where the line of sight crosses a dense region in the host .",
    "as for grb 080325 , the dust extinction along the line of sight to the burst is larger than that for the host as a whole and the grb is located at the outskirt of the host galaxy .",
    "therefore , the local dusty environment such as circumstellar matter and/or molecular cloud around grb 080325 is likely to be a major reason for the optical faintness of grb 080325 relative to x - ray brightness rather than extinction by dust distributed over the entire host .      as mentioned in  [ massive red host galaxy at ]",
    ", the host of grb 080325 is as luminous as @xmath11 at @xmath12 .",

    "the host of grb 080325 is located in the bright end of the apparent @xmath1 magnitude distribution of the goods south galaxies at the same redshift range .",
    "it is contrary to the distribution of other grb hosts , which are slightly fainter than that of the goods south galaxies . in this figure ,",
    "the host of grb 080325 is denoted by a red square .",
    "previously identified grb hosts with and without known redshift are shown by large blue dots and arrows and goods south field galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts are indicated by small black dots .",

    "figure [ figure9 ] shows stellar masses of grb hosts by @xcite ( large blue dots ) , goods south galaxies by ( small black dots ) , and grb 080325 host ( a red dot ) against redshift .",
    "figure [ figure9 ] clearly demonstrates that grb 080325 host is one of the most massive grb hosts ( @xmath108 = 7.0 @xmath26 10@xmath109 , described below ) among dark and non - dark grb hosts previously identified .",
    "we note that the methods of the sed fitting analysis are , in some degree , different between grb hosts by @xcite and other samples including goods south galaxies and grb 080325 hosts .",
    "@xcite assumed the imf by @xcite and two stellar - population components , while our sed - fitting analysis for grb 080325 host and goods south galaxies is based on salpeter imf and a single stellar - population component as described in  [ massive red host galaxy at ] .",
    "thus , to examine the effect by using different methods , stellar masses of grb hosts ( except for hosts for which only two - band data are available ) by @xcite were compared with those derived by our method .",
    "after the systematic difference between two imfs is taken into account , i.e. , a total stellar mass derived by salpeter imf is 1.8 times larger than that derived by using @xcite imf , we found that both stellar masses agree with each other within 1 @xmath110 uncertainty of @xmath111 . in figure",

    "this expected metallicity of grb 080325 host significantly exceeds the critical metallicity as shown in figure [ figure10 ] .",
    "this suggests a high metallicity environment around grb 080325 .",
    "similarly , high metallicity environments of grbs were recently reported for grb 020819 and grb 051022 by spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "these grbs commonly have massive hosts and are classified as dark .",
    "thus , these three cases including grb 080325 suggest the dusty high metallicity environment of grbs . as one explanation ,",
    "@xcite suggest the possibility that the enhanced mass loss rates associated with higher metallicities could potentially contribute to large amount of circumburst extinction , i.e. , to produce a dark grb . on the other hand ,",

    "the merging stars take in their orbital angular momentum during the merging process .",
    "therefore , the resulting collapsar can maintain a sufficient angular momentum required for a grb explosion even if the high - metallicity environment .",
    "however , we note that the metallicity at the grb position may be smaller than the critical metallicity , because of the metallicity gradient in the host ( the position of grb 080325 is at the edge of the host ) .",
