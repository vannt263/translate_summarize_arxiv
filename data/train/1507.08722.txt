    "a few decades of research has clarified that lipid bilayers can be treated as sheets obeying the continuum curvature / tension elasticity formulated by helfrich@xcite .",
    "characterising membrane elastic constants in numerical simulations has become an important issue due to the increase in computational power and development of simulation methods .",
    "starting with the seminal work of ref .",
    ", a growing number of research papers are dedicated to the determination of bending rigidity@xcite , gaussian modulus@xcite , and surface tension@xcite , from molecular simulation of all - atom systems to coarse - grained models .",
    "a number of questions have been raised regarding the definition of membrane surface tension .",
    "when a thermally fluctuating flexible membrane is stretched by a moderate lateral tension , the membrane extends its projected area by suppressing its transverse fluctuation@xcite .",
    "this leads to multiple definitions of membrane tension : i ) `` internal tension '' , @xmath0 , conjugated to the real area @xmath3 in the membrane hamiltonian , ii ) mechanical `` frame tension '' , @xmath1 , conjugated to the projected area @xmath4 , @xcite and iii ) `` fluctuation tension '' , @xmath2 , associated to the lowest - order wavevector dependence of the inverse fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the latter two are directly experimentally measurable@xcite .",
    "some discussions on the difference between these surface tensions have been lasting for more than a decade .",
    "first of all , it is well accepted that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are intrinsically different , because @xmath0 is a microscopic parameter belonging to the effective hamiltonian while @xmath1 is a macroscopic observable integrating the local stress tensor over all the membrane fluctuations .",
    "based on free - energy calculations and stress tensor averages , the difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 has been estimated within the gaussian approximation  @xcite . note that the validity of this estimation was questioned by schmid  @xcite .",
    "it is also well accepted that @xmath0 and @xmath2 are different , because @xmath2 is actually the renormalised version of @xmath0 ( at the gaussian level they are equal ) .",
    "the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath1 has been much debated .",
    "several authors have argued theoretically@xcite , or observed in numerical simulations@xcite , that @xmath2 matches the mechanical frame tension @xmath1 .",
    "other authors have observed a difference between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , either in numerical simulations @xcite or experiments@xcite .",
    "these questions should be carefully revisited with the help of extensive , large - scale numerical simulations .",
    "a complication has to do with the equivalence of ensembles in the thermodynamic sense , as in the simulations found in the literature , either the areas @xmath3 and @xmath4 or their conjugated tensions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are fixed .",
    "different ensembles are only equivalent in the thermodynamic limit of infinite membranes , @xmath5 at fixed @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the total number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it is therefore very important to check the convergence of the numerical results with system size . in another recent simulation@xcite , @xmath2",
    "was claimed to deviate from  @xmath1 for @xmath8 and to coincide with  @xmath1 for @xmath9 .",
    "it is thus interesting to study how @xmath2 behaves when @xmath1 assumes positive values very close to zero , for which the system undergoes large fluctuations .",
    "let us stress that investigating several orders of magnitude of @xmath1 is important , because membrane tension can experimentally vary over more than five decades@xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the differences between the three surface tensions , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , over several decades of @xmath1 , by means of monte carlo simulations of a lattice membrane system in the monge gauge . in the lattice model , the internal tension @xmath0 and the frame tension @xmath10 can be controlled and short range fluctuations generated by molecular or particle protrusions , which make accurate estimations of @xmath2 difficult , are not present .",
    "however , a measure correction is required to cure the excess entropy due to the unidirectional lattice - site motions implied by the monge gauge .",
    "we also employ exact nonlinear expressions to calculate the membrane s curvature and area .",
    "we find that @xmath0 differs from @xmath1 at small positive frame tensions , while they match at moderate and high frame tensions .",
    "our results for @xmath11 agree well with the prediction of ref .   based on a gaussian approximation ,",
    "although our simulation investigates regimes where the gaussian approximation is far from being justified .",
    "we find also that @xmath2 and @xmath1 match , within the accuracy of our simulation , over more than five decades , even in the limit of very small frame tensions .",
    "these relationships remain in the thermodynamic limit and seem not to depend on the ensemble in which the real area @xmath3 is controlled ( see appendix  [ ensembleafixed ] ) .",
    "our paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we detail our lattice membrane model and the monte carlo simulation framework that realises an equilibrium ensemble for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in this framework , the average of the real membrane area , @xmath12 , is kept constant by adjusting @xmath0 while @xmath1 is varied .",
    "we also perform our simulation in the equilibrium ensemble for fixed @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "this is discussed in appendix  [ ensembleafixed ] . in the thermodynamic limit of large systems ,",
    "we thus simulate a membrane with fixed real area subjected to a variable frame tension . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we numerically determine and we compare the three tensions @xmath0 , @xmath1 and  @xmath2 .",
    "we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "let us consider an incompressible , fluctuating lipid membrane with a fixed area @xmath13 , corresponding to a fixed number of lipids .",
    "we assume that it is attached to a deformable frame , of variable area @xmath4 , that exerts onto the membrane a fixed tension  @xmath1 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is thus given by@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the sum of the two principal curvatures of the membrane .",
    "the gaussian bending modulus@xcite @xmath16 has been neglected , according to the gauss  bonnet theorem , which is correct for fixed angular boundary conditions or periodic boundary conditions along the frame@xcite .",
    "we use the monge representation , in which the membrane shape is describe by its height @xmath17 above the plane of the frame . note that this parametrisation does not require the membrane deformation to be small .",
    "the only restriction is that overhangs are forbidden , since the function @xmath18 is single valued . in this representation , the total curvature @xmath19 is exactly given by@xcite @xmath20 where subscripts represent spatial derivatives , e.g. , @xmath21 .",
    "we work here in the non - linear regime , allowing for large deformations of the membrane , i.e. , we do not use the custom linear approximation @xmath22 ( employed in the gaussian framework ) . note that in our simulations ( see the details below ) the maximum slope , @xmath23 , reaches 1.3 at vanishing frame tension , but does not exceed this value .",
    "this justifies both using the exact expression for @xmath19 and neglecting overhangs .",
    "close to the buckling transition , however , i.e. , for large negative frame tensions , these assumptions may not be valid .",
    "because it is quite difficult to work with a fixed area @xmath13 , we change ensemble in order to control the conjugated internal tension @xmath0 , instead of the membrane area @xmath3 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the two ensembles are expected to be equivalent . indeed ,",
    "as shown in appendix  [ ensembleafixed ] , we find quantitatively similar results in the ensemble in which the real area @xmath3 is almost prescribed by means of a quadratic potential . in this stress ",
    "controlled ensemble , the modified hamiltonian weighting the membrane fluctuations is given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 systematically enforced by adjusting @xmath0 .      in order to implement the membrane fluctuations numerically ,",
    "we introduce a @xmath26 lattice on the plane @xmath27 of the frame , with lattice spacing @xmath28 .",
    "the height of the membrane surface is defined by @xmath29 on each lattice site , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the reminder of this paper , we take @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , we adopt periodic boundary condition .",
    "thus the projected area is given by @xmath33 .",
    "importantly , because the number of lipids is fixed while the frame area @xmath4 is variable , we take @xmath7 constant but @xmath28 variable . in other words , in our simulation",
    "the lattice spacing is not fixed .",
    "we stress , however , that @xmath28 always remains _ uniform _ over the lattice : it is the overall lattice spacing that changes .",
    "therefore the projection over the reference plane of the vertices always maps onto a square grid of finite spacing and the vertices can never overlap .",
    "note that a similar lattice membrane model ( with fixed spacing and the gaussian approximation ) has been employed for monte carlo simulation in order to investigate inclusions effects  @xcite .",
    "monte carlo simulations are performed with the lattice heights @xmath34 and the lattice spacing @xmath28 as dynamical variables .",
    "special care is required , however , for the sampling of the height variables . in the monge gauge",
    ", each site can only fluctuate in the @xmath35 direction , whereas in the physical gauge , because the membrane is fluid , the relevant fluctuations occur by local displacements along the membrane s normal . in order to avoid an artificial entropy increase of the states where the membrane is tilted",
    ", the naive measure @xmath36=\\prod_{i , j}dh_{ij}/\\delta_0 $ ] , where @xmath37 is a quantum of height fluctuations , must be transformed to @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the angle between the normal vector of the site @xmath40 and the @xmath35 axis , and @xmath41 . in this way ,",
    "the quantum height displacement in the normal direction is always @xmath37 .",
    "equivalently , we can keep the naive measure @xmath36 $ ] and add to the hamiltonian the following correction term : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the temperature and @xmath44 boltzmann s constant . note",
    "that this correction , that would be exact if the membrane was uniformly tilted , is only approximate if the tilt changes from site to site . in practice",
    ", it works well when the membrane slope is small , as in the present simulations . for highly tilted membranes , such as buckled membranes ,",
    "the correction term , eqn  ( [ eq : hcor ] ) , is not sufficient , as discussed in appendix  [ app : ang ] .",
    "the partition function in the stress  controlled ensemble introduced above is given by @xmath45\\ \\exp [ -\\mathcal{h}'/(k_\\mathrm{b}t ) ] , \\ ] ] with @xmath46 .",
    "metropolis sampling is employed  @xcite . in each monte carlo step ,",
    "@xmath7 trial moves of the height of a random site are attempted .",
    "the change of @xmath28 ( hence @xmath4 ) is attempted every @xmath47 monte carlo steps .",
    "the amplitudes of the @xmath29 and @xmath4 changes are adjusted so that the rejection rate lies in the range 40%60% . both @xmath3 and @xmath4 change during the simulations . however , for a given monte carlo run at a specified value of @xmath1 , the internal tension @xmath0 is adjusted in order for the average of the membrane area @xmath12 to have the specific value @xmath48 , fixed once for all .    in our simulation , the real area @xmath3 of the membrane",
    "is calculated as follows . the local area associated to a site @xmath49",
    "is obtained as one half of the total area of the four triangles [ apb ] , [ bpc ] , [ cpd ] and [ dpa ] built from the neighbouring sites of coordinates : @xmath50 the area of each triangle can be calculated by using height differences between the lattice sites .",
    "then , the total real area can be expressed as @xmath51    simulation are carried out at least for @xmath52 steps after the initial relaxation .",
    "the statistical errors are calculated from four or more independent runs .",
    "since our simulated membrane has a prescribed _ average _ area @xmath48 and a fixed number @xmath7 of degrees of freedom , we can picture each degree of freedom as a patch of lipids of fixed average area @xmath53 . in the following we are going to nondimensionalise the lengths by @xmath54 ( the size of a degree of freedom in the membrane ) and the energies by @xmath55  j ( room temperature energy ) .",
    "in other words , we shall set @xmath56 .",
    "hence , all tensions will be given in units of @xmath57 .",
    "as previously discussed , we shall thus adjust @xmath0 for each @xmath1 in order to have systematically @xmath58 , in dimensionless units .    , @xmath59 ( tensionless frame ) , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 achieved for @xmath62 .",
    "the lengths are given in units of @xmath54 , which corresponds to the size of a coarse - grained degree of freedom in the membrane .",
    "in this simulation , the equilibrium lattice spacing is @xmath63 , which corresponds to @xmath64 .",
    "with typically @xmath65 and @xmath55  j , the residual internal tension is about @xmath66  j / m@xmath67 . ]    let us estimate tension scale @xmath57 . in principle , we are free to choose the linear size @xmath54 of the lipid patches that constitute our degrees of freedom .",
    "it is convenient , however , to choose the smallest possible size , in order to allow for all possible fluctuations and to avoid using renormalised elastic constants .",
    "owing to the level of coarse - graining of our simulation , in which the bilayer membrane of real thickness @xmath68  nm is treated as a mathematical surface , it is natural to think of the lipid patches as regions of typical size , e.g. @xmath65 .",
    "then , the natural unit of tension in our simulation is @xmath69  j / m@xmath67 .",
    "the tension mechanically imposed on ordinary vesicle membranes , in experiments , are in the range @xmath70  j / m@xmath67@xmath71  j / m@xmath67 , where the smallest value corresponds to floppy vesicles and the largest value corresponds to the lytic tension@xcite .",
    "we shall therefore have @xmath1 span the range @xmath71@xmath72 in dimensionless units .",
    "let us stress that this corresponds to five orders of magnitude .    in our simulation , we choose a specific value of the bending rigidity corresponding to @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath74 in dimensionless units .",
    "we shall consider membrane sizes corresponding to @xmath75 and @xmath76 . with the value of @xmath54 given above , this corresponds to membrane of linear dimension @xmath77  nm , @xmath78  nm , @xmath79 m and @xmath80 m , respectively .",
    "these values are quite small if one thinks of macroscopic experiments , but they are reasonably large on the biological scale . because of the change of ensemble that we have performed , we shall check the convergence of our results with increasing @xmath7 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : view3d ] , a simulation snapshot for @xmath60 is shown in the tensionless state @xmath59 .",

    "as explained above , we place ourselves in the @xmath81 ensemble ; however , for every imposed frame tension @xmath1 , we determine the internal tension @xmath0 that achieves @xmath82 .",

    "in other words , the residual tension turns out to be fairly independent of system size .",
    "when @xmath1 decreases below some negative threshold @xmath91 , the membrane buckles either into the @xmath92 or the @xmath93 direction : the average membrane shape undergoes a transition from flat to non - flat through a symmetry breaking ( like a rod under compression ) .",

    "previously , two of the present authors have been addressed in detail the question of the estimation for the bending rigidity from simulation data@xcite .",

    "the gaussian approximation , which is frequently used in basic calculations , consists in replacing the bending energy density @xmath129 by @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the laplacian approximation of the mean - curvature and @xmath133 the projected elementary area , and in neglecting the entropy measure correction @xmath130 .",

    "gaussian approximation artefacts are also excluded because curvatures and areas are computed with exact formulas ( although we employ the monge gauge ) and because we have corrected the excess entropy associated with the measure of the monge gauge .",

    "how exactly the thermal fluctuations of the membrane modify the mechanical buckling transition should be investigated in further studies .",
