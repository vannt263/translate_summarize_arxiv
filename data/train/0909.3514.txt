    "the full - sky observations of gamma rays undertaken in the 1990s by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) revealed a map which is highly anisotropic .",
    "it showed a number of resolved sources  @xcite , such as blazars , as well as an unresolved component , which can be attributed almost entirely to galactic emission .",
    "the mechanisms which produce the diffuse galactic emission ( inverse compton scattering , @xmath0 production and bremsstrahlung ) are well understood .",
    "however , the actual intensity of each of these contributions depends on many details of the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy , including the interstellar radiation and magnetic fields and the galactic gas distribution . on the other hand , over the last years",
    "a picture of cosmic - ray propagation has emerged which can account for the observed abundances of _ almost _ all secondary cosmic - ray species .",
    "remarkably , this same propagation model can reproduce , using the interstellar gas and radiation field distributions and a galactic magnetic field inferred from observations , the full - sky gamma - ray map with rather good accuracy .",
    "however , this requires the introduction of an additional , a priori undetermined , diffuse component which is postulated to be of extragalactic origin and thus isotropic .",
    "its energy spectrum is determined by observations at high galactic latitudes .",
    "recently it has become apparent that the state - of - the - art propagation models fail to reproduce the measurements of the _ positron fraction _ at energies larger than 10 gev .",
    "namely , the secondary positron flux calculated with current propagation models , together with the total electron - plus - positron spectrum measured by the fermi lat , yields a positron fraction which monotonically decreases with energy , whereas the pamela observations reveal that above 10 gev the positron fraction increases with energy  @xcite .",
    "this puzzling behavior , already suggested in the past by a series of experiments such as heat  @xcite , has been interpreted as evidence for a primary component of the positron flux ( possibly accompanied by an identical electron flux ) .",
    "furthermore , the conventional propagation model adopted by the fermi collaboration , dubbed `` model 0 '' , which fits well the low - energy data points of the total electron - plus - positron flux and the positron fraction , fails to reproduce the observations at higher energies , reinforcing the necessity of an exotic source of primary electrons and positrons .",
    "the most common astrophysical explanation of the electron / positron excesses is the electron - positron pair production by the interactions of high - energy photons in the strong magnetic field of nearby pulsars , such as geminga or monogem  @xcite .",
    "however , this interpretation requires a rather large percentage of the total spin - down power injected in the form of electron - positron pairs , namely about @xmath1 , and a large cutoff of the electron / positron energy spectrum at about 1 tev .",
    "alternatively , the electron / positron excesses could be explained by the combined emission of both nearby and distant pulsars , this solution requiring a percentage of spin - down power ranging between 10 @xmath2 30% and again a large cutoff in the energy spectrum , 800 @xmath2 1400 gev  @xcite .",
    "an arguably more exciting explanation of the cosmic - ray electron / positron excesses is the possibility that the electrons and positrons are produced in the annihilation  @xcite or the decay  @xcite of dark matter particles . despite the overwhelming gravitational evidence for the existence of non - baryonic dark matter , which makes up more than one - fifth of the energy budget of the universe  @xcite ,",
    "very little is known about its particle nature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . the most popular type of dark matter candidate , the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , can naturally reproduce the observed dark matter abundance due to effective self - annihilation in the early universe , after being in thermal equilibrium with the baryons before .",
    "today , this same annihilation process is expected to produce a possibly observable contribution to the measured cosmic - ray fluxes on earth .",
    "detection of such an indirect signal would be the first non - gravitational evidence for dark matter , with paramount importance to the understanding of its nature .",
    "a lot of effort has been made to study the prospects and predictions of cosmic - ray signatures from annihilating dark matter , see _ e.g. _  @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the only possibility for the indirect detection of dark matter .",
    "many dark matter models predict that the dark matter particle is unstable and decays with very long lifetimes  @xcite .",
    "if the decays occur at a sufficiently large rate , the decay products could be observable as an exotic contribution to the high energy cosmic ray fluxes of gamma rays , electrons , positrons , antiprotons , neutrinos or antideuterons  @xcite . among these ,",
    "the gamma - ray channel is probably the most important to study , due to its sensitivity to far - distant sources and its potential to discriminate between signals from annihilating or decaying dark matter and astrophysical sources .    in this paper we will present a detailed study of the peculiar predictions for gamma rays from decaying dark matter .",
    "we will concentrate on their angular anisotropies on large and small scales .",
    "these can be used to discriminate this component from other contributions to the extragalactic diffuse emission .",
    "it turns out that the predictions for decaying dark matter are much more robust than the ones for annihilation , which makes this scenario very predictive and easier to confirm or falsify  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we will discuss the prospects to see such signals in the upcoming fermi lat gamma - ray data , and we will apply our results to the decaying dark matter explanation of the electron / positron excess .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : gammas ] we will review the basic concepts about production , propagation and absorption of gamma rays from dark matter decay . in section  [ sec : fermi ]",
    "we will calculate the gamma - ray anisotropy expected from the decay of dark matter particles on large angular scales .",
    "we will show in particular the expected anisotropy in scenarios which can explain the electron / positron excesses observed by pamela and the fermi lat , and we will argue that this anisotropy should be seen by the fermi lat . in section  [ sec : power ] we will calculate the angular power spectrum of gamma rays from decaying dark matter on small angular scales and comment on its observational prospects .",
    "lastly , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] , we will present our conclusions .",
    "we also present two appendices in which we discuss statistical properties of the large - scale anisotropy and the general observational strategy for gamma rays from dark matter decay .",
