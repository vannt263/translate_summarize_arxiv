    "since the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a sun - like star in 1995 @xcite radial velocity ( rv ) measurements and transit photometry have been the dominate techniques for the detection and characterization of exoplanets .",
    "long - term ground - based rv surveys and in particular nasa s space mission _ kepler _ enable us to constrain the occurrence rate of planets around other stars as a function of planetary mass , size , and orbital period .",
    "@xcite presented rv statistics for solar - type host stars and planets with periods out to 10 years and minimum masses as low as @xmath33  10 m@xmath0 .",
    "similarly , @xcite analyzed the occurrence rate of planets with sizes @xmath12 r@xmath0 and orbital periods @xmath4 days ( @xmath30.25 au ) around solar - type stars using _ kepler _ data .",
    "both studies demonstrated that low - mass / small planets are much more frequent than massive / large planets .",
    "as the probability of observing a planet transiting in front of its host stars decreases with orbital separation and as the detection of a planet by rv measurements normally requires the coverage of a full orbit , these two techniques typically reveal planets in the inner few au around a star .",
    "this means that in order to get a census of exoplanets at larger orbital separations other techniques have to complement rv and transit searches .",
    "the two most important techniques here are microlensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and direct imaging .",
    "we will focus on the latter one throughout this article .",
    "numerous direct imaging surveys carried out in the last years rule out the existence of a large population of massive gas giants planets ( @xmath52 m@xmath6 ) on wide orbits ( @xmath550 au ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) 50 stars .",
    "] . however , a few fascinating systems were revealed by direct imaging @xcite partly challenging our understanding of the formation and atmospheric properties of gas giant planets .",
    "the key challenge for direct imaging is to obtain a high - contrast performance at very small inner working angles ( iwa ) so that the faint signal of a planetary companion can be detected and separated from the strong signal of the nearby star .",
    "if successful , the direct detection of photons from an exoplanet offers a unique pathway to study and characterize the planet s atmospheric properties .",
    "transit or secondary eclipse photometry and spectroscopy can in principle also be used to probe the atmosphere of exoplanets directly and currently these techniques produce most of the corresponding results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , typically only close - in planets can be studied in this way because the probability of transit declines with increasing semimajor axis . as the orbital inclination of exoplanets",
    "is randomly distributed in the sky when seen from earth , the vast majority of the overall exoplanet population does _ not _ transit in front of and behind their host star . in order to investigate these objects and study exoplanet atmospheres covering a wide range of planetary masses and orbital separations , direct imaging observations - ground - based or space - based - are essential .",
    "currently , dedicated high - contrast exoplanet imagers are being installed at 8-m telescopes : sphere at the vlt ( very large telescope ) @xcite and gpi on gemini south @xcite .",
    "these instruments work in the optical and/or near - infrared and , depending on their final on - sky performance , they are expected to detect gas giant planets down to 10 au or so around young , nearby stars",
    ". smaller and shorter period planets are typically beyond the reach of these instruments as their contrast performance , sensitivity and spatial resolution are still insufficient .    in this paper , we quantify two exoplanet imaging science cases for ground - based extremely large telescopes ( elts ) .",
    "our focus is on the 3  10 @xmath7 m wavelength range , which is normally dominated by thermal emission from the planets rather than by reflected starlight .",
    "we take metis @xcite as our default instrument in our analyses .",
    "metis could be the third instrument installed at the 39-m european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) according to the e - elt instrumentation roadmap .",
    "it is ao - assisted and currently foreseen to offer imaging and medium - resolution spectroscopy over the full l , m and n band wavelength range ( 3  14 microns ) .",
    "high - resolution integral field spectroscopy is planned for the l and m bands ( 3 - 5.3 microns ) . in section 2",
    "we motivate the use of this wavelength range for exoplanet research . in section 3",
    "we quantify two major exoplanet science cases for metis : ( a ) the fraction of the currently known exoplanets detected by radial velocity that can be imaged with e - elt / metis ; and ( b ) the prospects of directly detecting small planets around nearby stars .",
    "we discuss our findings in section 4 and conclude in section 5 .",
    "the motivation to exploit thermal infrared ( ir ) wavelengthsm wavelength range while near - infrared ( nir ) refers to 1  2.5 @xmath7 m . ] for exoplanet imaging has a scientific and a technical aspect .      by observing at thermal ir wavelengths a slightly different part of the exoplanet parameter space",
    "is probed compared to current observations in the nir .",
    "this becomes clear just by considering wien s law and estimating the blackbody temperatures that correspond to the central wavelength of each filter .",
    "for the direct detection of thermal emission from self - luminous gas giant exoplanets , for a given age , one is able to probe less massive planets or , for a given mass , one is able to search around older stars .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the very red infrared colors of planetary mass objects and the fact that they contract and cool during their evolution ( for theoretical work on gas giant planet evolution and luminosities see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . a nice example , demonstrating the power of observing in the thermal infrared , is provided by the recently discovered planetary mass companion to the a - type star hd95086 by @xcite .",
    "while the planet was clearly detected in the l band ( 3.8 @xmath7 m ) it remained undetected in h and ks ( @xmath31.6 and 2.3 @xmath7 m ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another aspect is the search for planets that are still somewhat embedded in the circumstellar disks of their host stars .",
    "the opacities of dust grains typically found in these disks have wavelength dependent extinction effects , with shorter wavelengths photons being more strongly affected .",
    "hence , it could be possible to detect young planets in the thermal infrared that remain unseen at nir wavelengths .",
    "a possible example is the candidate protoplanet detected in the disk around the young intermediate mass star hd100546 .",
    "@xcite detected the object in the l band .",
    "if all of the observed flux arose from the photosphere of a `` normal '' low - mass companion its mass would be 20  25 m@xmath6 according to theoretical models .",
    "@xcite analyzed k band data from gemini / nici of the same star and were not able to detect the companion candidate even though the data were good enough to see a 15  20 m@xmath6 object based on the same models . in the meantime , the object was re - detected in a new l band dataset ( quanz et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . whether extinction is the dominant effect here or whether the intrinsic properties of the object only allow for a detection in the l band is still to be investigated , but it clearly shows that observations at thermal infrared wavelengths can reveal objects that are not easily accessible with nir observations .    for old exoplanets , depending on the instrument performance and the properties of the exoplanetary system , it might be `` easier '' to detect reflected starlight from the planet at optical or nir wavelengths than thermal emission at longer wavelengths",
    ". however , typically thermal emission from planets depends significantly less on the orbital phase and orbital inclination of the object compared to observations in reflected light . also , reflected light observations give only access to the product of atmospheric albedo and planet radius and additional observations are required to break the degeneracy .",
    "having an estimate for the effective temperature of the planet from its thermal emission and knowing the distance to the object directly yields its radius .",
    "we emphasize that in the ideal case one wants to combine the information obtained from thermal emission _ with _ those from reflected light .",
    "this provides complementary insights in atmospheric properties and allows for a significantly higher degree of characterization ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    finally , once a planet has been detected , it is important to understand the diagnostic power of different wavelength bands for the characterization of the object .",
    "concerning potential atmospheric constituents is worth recalling that the l , m and n bands include some main molecular features , for example ch@xmath8 ( 3.3 @xmath7 m ) , co ( 4.7 @xmath7 m ) , and o@xmath9 ( 4.7 @xmath7 m , 9.6 @xmath7 m ) . in particular for the gas giant planets that have already been directly imaged ( e.g. , the hr8799 system ) the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the l band between 3.2  4.0",
    "@xmath7 m is of substantial diagnostic power to constrain the ratio between co and ch@xmath8 in the atmosphere and to search for potential chemical disequilibrium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additional indications for chemical disequilibrium could also come from the very red end of the l band .",
    "@xcite took a low - resolution l band spectrum of the exoplanet hr8799 c and found an apparent deficiency in flux beyond 4 @xmath7 m as predicted by non - equilibrium atmospheric models .",
    "in addition , clouds seem to play a crucial role in shaping the seds of these massive planets . also here",
    ", the l band regime proves to be an important diagnostic window ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "turning to smaller , rocky planets it turns out that the n band could potentially be used to constrain the surface composition of warm / hot objects .",
    "@xcite presented simulations of 8  13 @xmath7 m spectra for rocky planet with different surface temperatures and compositions .",
    "surface characterization could provide a powerful method to unambiguously identify a rocky , airless exoplanet .      as mentioned above",
    ", the direct detection and characterization of exoplanets requires high - contrast performance at very small iwa .",
    "given their very different effective temperatures , the flux contrast between stars and planets in the 3  10 @xmath7 m range is less stark than at optical or near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "hence , the instrument requirements in terms of achievable contrast performance can be less stringent for observation in the thermal infrared .",
    "in addition , ao systems on large ground - based telescopes provide higher strehl ratios at thermal infrared wavelengths compared to the optical or nir .",
    "this , again , helps to tackle the contrast problem as more light from the central star is concentrated in the core of the psf and less flux is left in the uncorrected halo .",
    "ao - assisted thermal infrared imagers provide strehl ratios in the l and m band that are at least comparable , if not superior , to the expected strehl ratios of the next generation high - contrast imagers working in the nir .",
    "lmircam at the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) is equipped with an adaptive secondary mirror and typically reaches strehl ratios of 80  90% in the l and m band .",
    "this is also the goal for the planned eris instrument at the vlt .    the key challenge to overcome , when observing in the thermal infrared from the ground , is the background emission from the sky , the telescope and the optical components within the instrument . on the one hand ,",
    "the photon noise from these contributions sets the ultimate detection limit for a given observing time , but temporal fluctuations in the background pose an additional problem .",
    "great improvements can be made if this issue is taken into account already in the design phase of an instrument by minimizing the amount of `` warm '' components in the light path .",
    "good examples are clio , formerly installed at the multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) , lbt / lmircam and vlt / eris .",
    "a technical goal for high contrast imaging at thermal infrared wavelengths is to move the background limited regime as close as possible to the central star .",
    "if one is background - limited and not contrast - limited then - to first order - by increasing the observing time , higher sensitivities can be reached ( the snr is then proportional to @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the integration time ) .",
    "different coronagraphic designs to cancel out the diffraction rings around the central star have been developed in recent years specifically for observations between 3  10@xmath7 m .",
    "some of them have been installed on 8-m telescopes ( e.g. , naco / app , naco / agpm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "typically , these coronagraphs in combination with optimized imaging techniques ( e.g. , adi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and advanced data reduction algorithms ( e.g. , pynpoint ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aim at moving the background limit ( bgl ) as close as @xmath12 to the star , which would then correspond to the high - contrast iwa of the imaging system .",
    "one key aspect we would like to emphasize is that with the advent of 25  40 m diffraction limited telescopes , observations at thermal infrared wavelengths become significantly more efficient . in the sky background",
    "limited case and for a given snr the time to complete an observation scales as @xmath13 , which is an enormous advantage for future extremely large telescopes compared to current 8 m class telescopes .",

    "irrespective of the age of the system , multiple epoch observations yield the orbital inclination of the planet and allow for the derivation of the planet s true mass .",
    "this information , together with the observed brightness ( possibly in multiple bands ) and host star properties , can then be used to characterize individual planets and to constrain atmospheric models of planetary mass objects . at young ages ,",
    "direct imaging is the only technique that can break some of the degeneracies existing in the atmospheric and evolutionary models of gas giant planets and to constrain the initial conditions for gas giant planet formation .",

    "based on the current census of exoplanets discovered by rv , we quantify how many planets an instrument such as metis at the e - elt could detect . to do so , we retrieved the list of known exoplanets detected by rv from the exoplanet.eu database ( as of july 29 , 2013 ; * ? ? ?",
    "not all relevant parameters are known for all of these systems . to be conservative we disregarded objects with unknown values for the semi - major axis @xmath20 , orbital period @xmath21 , distance from earth to the host star @xmath22 , or argument of periastron @xmath23 . in cases where the orbital eccentricity @xmath24 was not known ,",
    "we conservatively assumed @xmath25 . if the orbits were , however , eccentric , the planets would be easier to detect as they would spend more time at larger separations from their host star . for systems with no estimate for the age , we assumed an age of 5 gyr , which is the average age of the planets with age estimates .",
    "furthermore , we only considered objects with a minimum mass of @xmath26 m@xmath6 .",
    "initial estimates suggested that planets with lower minimum masses would not be easily detectable with our underlying assumptions .",
    "this is supported by our final results , where the lowest mass planet that is detectable has @xmath27 m@xmath6 ( see below ) even though numerous planets with masses 0.3 m@xmath6 @xmath28 m@xmath6 were included in the input sample . in total , the initial input sample had 352 objects , still including objects from both the northern and southern hemisphere .",
    "we used the cond atmospheric models @xcite to compute the apparent l and m band magnitudes for the planets as a function of age and minimum mass .",
    "this approach is again conservative in 2 ways : ( 1 ) using the given minimum mass to estimate the planets brightness is conservative , as planets with higher masses would be brighter and hence easier to detect at all ages ; ( 2 ) for some planets the expected equilibrium temperature @xmath29 may exceed the effective temperature predicted by the cond models @xmath30 in which case the planets brightness is also underestimated .    in a next step , we estimated the typical on - sky separation between the planet and its host star and compared it to the assumed iwa of metis in the l and m band . in cases where the orbital inclination @xmath31 of the planet is known ( or at least estimated ) , it is straight forward to compute the apparent separation between planet and star as a function of time . for most rv planets ,",
    "however , @xmath31 and also the longitude of the ascending node @xmath32 are unknown .",
    "we did a monte - carlo simulation for these two variables to estimate the probability distribution of the on - sky separation knowing all the other orbital parameter .",
    "we then only kept ( 1 ) planets with known @xmath31 where the apastron passage exceeds a separation of @xmath12 , and ( 2 ) planets with unknown @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where the probability of finding the planet at a separation @xmath33 exceeds 50% , if one were to observe the object at a random time .",
    "this selection resulted in 130 and 95 objects in the l and m band , respectively .",
    "we then excluded 25 objects in the l band and 19 objects in the m band as their declination was higher than our assumed limit .",
    "finally , we compared the estimated l and m band magnitudes of the remaining objects to our assumed 5-@xmath34 sensitivity limits ( table  [ metis_table ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig.1 ] shows that , given the selection criteria described above , metis is capable of directly detecting 26 of the known gas giant planets in the l band , 13 of which are also detectable in the m band .",
    "the planets cover a range in minimum mass roughly between 1 and 18 m@xmath6 and their host stars span a wide magnitude range for a given distance , which indicates an interesting spread in both planet and also host star properties .",
    "furthermore , the planets span a wide range in semi - major axis and also orbital eccentricity .",
    "this leads to a wide range of planetary temperatures across the whole sample , but also to significant changes in stellar insolation for individual planets on highly eccentric orbits .",
    "a first - order estimate for the expected equilibrium temperature reveals that 2 planets ( hd 62509 b and hd 60532 b ) likely have effective temperatures higher than those predicted by the models applied in our selection process .",
    "hence , these planets should appear even brighter and be easier to detect than shown here .",
    "finally , three of the planets reside in stellar binary systems ( hd196885 a b , hd106515 a b , and gj676 a b ) , and there are two systems where two planets can be detected ( hd 60532 b , c and hd 128311 b , c ) .",
    "these latter systems potentially allow a direct comparison of gas giant properties within extrasolar planetary systems .",

    "briefly described , this analysis simulates thousands of plausible extrasolar planetary systems using measurements of planet frequency from the _ kepler _ satellite @xcite and estimates the likelihood of finding a detectable planet by comparing the planets predicted blackbody fluxes to analytic estimates of high - contrast performance @xcite and detection limits . unlike in section 3.1 .",
    ", here the planet s thermal emission does not come from residual heat of formation , but from absorbed and reprocessed starlight .",
    "contributions from reflected starlight to the observed planet fluxes is also taken into account .",
    "for this , the planet s bond albedo and geometric albedo are assumed to be wavelength independent and are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 0.0  0.4 @xcite .",
    "compared to the original study done by @xcite , which had the goal of comparing the expected detection yield of different wavelength regimes , instrument performances and telescope sizes , the present study is different in a number of aspects .",
    "@xcite focused primarily on contrast performance and did not explicitly include constraints coming from sensitivity estimates .",
    "ground - based thermal infrared imaging has , however , quite severe sensitivity constraints coming from the high background emission at these wavelengths .",
    "the present analysis takes sensitivity limits explicitly into account ( table  [ metis_table ] ) .",
    "also , while @xcite was a comprehensive but partly generic case study , the present analysis is for a specific telescope and a specific instrument .",
    "the corresponding sensitivity estimates were derived using an instrument simulator ( including , e.g. , a model psf , sky background noise , throughput , relevant telescope parameters ) .",
    "furthermore , in light of the results presented in the previous section , we extended our analysis beyond 8 pc ( as in * ? ? ? * ) to include all dwarf stars with @xmath50 mag and @xmath51  pc .",
    "we removed close binaries , gathered stellar photometry and parallaxes from the literature ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and simbad ) , adopted stellar radii and effective temperatures based on interferometric measurements of similar stars @xcite , and assigned stellar masses using the v - band relation of @xcite . selecting only objects with declination @xmath1630@xmath17 ,",
    "this final target list includes 246 objects ; 24 of these host already known planets or planet candidates , most of which do not pass the detection threshold that we impose in our analysis , as they are either too close to the star and/or too faint .",
    "finally , the present analysis determines how many planets are detectable in more than one filter ( see below ) and provides a concrete list of stars for which we summarize the detection probabilities per filter .",
    "this new monte - carlo analysis reveals that @xmath210 small planets within 15 pc should be detected in at least one of the l , m , or n bands .",
    "roughly 5 objects could be observed in both l and m band , and a small number ( @xmath32 ) might be observable in a combination of n and l and/or m. the results are summarized in figure  [ fig.3 ] , where we show the 2-d probability distributions ( planetary radius vs. equilibrium temperature ) separately for the l , m , and n band .",
    "roughly 25% of the planets have radii of 12 r@xmath52 .",
    "the rest has radii @xmath53 and is increasingly likely to host a substantial gaseous envelope ( cf .",
    "the expected @xmath29 of the smaller planets is @xmath54  k higher than for the larger planets .",
    "this is a selection effect : in our simulations , larger planets ( @xmath55 ) are seen mainly in reflected starlight ( even in m band ) ; smaller planets , however , must emit relatively more thermal radiation to climb above the sensitivity threshold , and so thermal radiation comprises up to @xmath56% of their observed flux . for the l and m band",
    "the most likely range of equilibrium temperature is 300  500 k , while , statistically , in the n band a couple of planets in the 200  400 k range should be found .    for the results shown in table  [ rocky_planets ] we changed the perspective and analyzed which stars in our sample are the best targets for planet searches .",
    "we only list objects where the probability of detecting a planet - regardless of size or temperature - is at least 10% in one of the observational bands .",
    "table  [ rocky_planets ] emphasizes that , according to our simulations , the l band is the best wavelength range to search for planets , but it also shows that - based on the _ kepler _ planet occurrence statistics - for some stars there is a fair chance to detect planets in more than one band .",
    "the analyses presented in the previous sections rely on some assumptions and led to some results that warrant further discussion .    concerning the assumed sensitivity limits it is obvious that these are preliminary and are probably subject to change in the course of the metis project",
    "however , the values represent the current state of knowledge .",
    "similarly , the exact filter profiles are not yet defined for metis .",
    "this leads to some uncertainties when we compare the predicted fluxes for the rv - detected gas giant planets to the metis detection limits because the model predictions were computed for a different filter set .",
    "however , this effect is expected to be rather small , especially compared to the uncertainties in the models themselves .",
    "assuming that metis will achieve background - limited performance down to an iwa as small as @xmath12 is certainly a challenging goal , both from a technical and a data processing point of view .",
    "until now , in some cases , the background limit was only reached at @xmath57 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". the coming years will show whether the continuous progress in coronagraphic and data processing techniques is sufficient to enable such a demanding , but scientifically crucial , performance at the e - elt .",
    "finally , our analyses did not take into account that , depending on the final instrument design and coronagraphs used , additional observing time is required to achieve the detection limits assumed here in a full 360@xmath17 circle around the target stars .",
    "pupil plane coronagraphs will alter the general throughout of the instrument and do not necessarily create a centro - symmetric high - contrast region around the star for separations @xmath58 @xcite . for focal plane coronagraphs additional overhead might be created by regular switching between the target star and a reference sky location for sky subtraction .",

    "+    for the rv - detected planets it is clear that some of the orbit parameters listed in the exoplanet.eu database may be refined by future observations or that for some systems different groups obtained slightly different results .",
    "however , the selection and detection criteria we applied were rather conservative ( e.g. , minimum mass , @xmath59 ) so that detection biases introduced by uncertain orbit parameter should not have a significant effect .",
    "also , we did not take into account any possible contribution from reflected starlight to the emission coming from the planets .",
    "this contribution is , however , indeed in most cases negligible as the planet - star flux ratio is on average @xmath60 only considering the planets thermal emission , while the flux ratio in reflected light is typically at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "more importantly we need to emphasize that the possible metis target sample might significantly change in the coming years . with increasing time baselines of rv planet surveys , additional long period gas giant planets",
    "can expected to be found in the future , some of which yielding better detection probabilities than the objects listed here .",
    "in addition , the _ gaia _ spacecraft will reveal additional long period gas giant planets using high - precision astrometric measurements . also here",
    "we can expect additional high - priority targets for direct imaging follow - up studies with e - elt / metis .",
    "the assumptions for the monte - carlo simulations of nearby small planets and their impact on the results have been discussed in length in @xcite .",
    "one of the key assumptions is that the _ kepler _ results for the innermost @xmath30.25 au follow a flat distribution for wider orbits in logarithmic period space .",
    "however , this assumption is consistent with the recent analysis of four full years of kepler data @xcite .",
    "once a planet candidate has been imaged around a nearby star , follow - up observations within a few months will not only be able to confirm common proper motion of the planet and its host star , but they allow also for a robust determination of the planet s orbit and hence of the received stellar insolation as a function of orbital phase .",
    "an assessment of whether any of the small planets accessible to metis are potentially habitable is clearly beyond the scope of this paper . to be sure ,",
    "a broader wavelengths coverage is certainly required for an in - depth analysis of atmospheric features .",
    "however , it becomes more and more clear that life can exist over a broad temperature range and a current upper limit appears to be @xmath3400 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "in addition , the basic concept of the habitable zone around a star is undergoing major revisions , and of particular interest for the analyses presented here it seems that , under certain atmospheric conditions , the inner edge of the habitable zone around solar type stars extends much closer in - and hence to higher equilibrium temperatures - than originally thought @xcite .",
    "to push the characterization aspect a bit further , a possible next steps could be to replace the assumed black - body curves with more realistic atmospheric models with different compositions and resulting albedos . not only",
    "will this help us to further refine the detection probabilities for different planet types , but we can also quantify to what degree the different spectroscopy modes of metis and other future instruments could be used to further characterize the small planets that we can expect to find .",
    "we explored two exoplanet science cases for the future 3  10 micron instrument metis planned for the e - elt .",
    "one of the key assumptions in our analyses is that metis will be background - limited at iwas as small as @xmath12 , which is certainly technically challenging .",
    "we showed that already there is an interesting and sizable sample of rv - detected gas giant planets that metis will be able to image directly within a reasonable amount of observing time .",
    "more than 20 objects covering a wide range of planetary masses and host star spectral types will be detectable in the l band , and half of those objects will also be seen in the m band given the detection limits we assume . with the continuation of rv searches for long period planets and with the advent of the _ gaia _ astrometry mission , many more , and",
    "perhaps better suited , targets will be added to the list in the future .",
    "studying those objects in a grander sample with metis will allow us for the first time to test and refine atmospheric models for planets where the distance , and the object s mass , orbit and luminosity are empirically determined .",
    "in addition to detecting cool gas giant planets , we showed that e - elt / metis could be the first instrument that might image a small and potentially rocky planet around one of the nearest stars . based on the _ kepler _ statistics metis might detect @xmath210 planets within 15 pc in at least one band ( l , m or n ) .",
    "the l band offers the broadest discovery space for all planet - star combinations we analyzed .",
    "roughly 5 objects should be observable in both l and m band , and for a couple of objects we might get a detection in n , l and/or m. statistically speaking , most of these planets are expected to have equilibrium temperatures between 300  500 k , and at least a quarter of them will have a radius between 1  2 r@xmath52 . hence ,",
    "if those planets do exist around some of the nearest stars , metis might reveal an object with potentially habitable conditions .",

    "<S> we quantify the scientific potential for exoplanet imaging with the mid - infrared e - elt imager and spectrograph ( metis ) foreseen as one of the instruments of the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on two main science cases : ( 1 ) the direct detection of known gas giant planets found by radial velocity ( rv ) searches ; and ( 2 ) the direct detection of small ( 1  4 r@xmath0 ) planets around the nearest stars . under the assumptions made in our modeling , </S>",
    "<S> in particular on the achievable inner working angle and sensitivity , our analyses reveal that within a reasonable amount of observing time metis is able to image @xmath120 already known , rv - detected planets in at least one filter </S>",
    "<S> . many more suitable planets with dynamically determined masses are expected to be found in the coming years with the continuation of rv - surveys and the results from the gaia astrometry mission . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by extrapolating the statistics for close - in planets found by _ kepler _ , we expect metis might detect @xmath210 small planets with equilibrium temperatures between 200  500 k around the nearest stars . </S>",
    "<S> this means that ( 1 ) metis will help constrain atmospheric models for gas giant planets by determining for a sizable sample their luminosity , temperature and orbital inclination ; and ( 2 ) metis might be the first instrument to image a nearby ( super-)earth - sized planet with an equilibrium temperature near that expected to enable liquid water on a planet surface . </S>"
