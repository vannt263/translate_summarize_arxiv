    "as a well - established tracer of the newly formed massive stars and star associations and clusters , the distribution of h ii regions has sparked a long interest since the pioneering investigations in nearby spiral galaxies , as reviewed by @xcite .",
    "extensive statistical analyses of galactic h ii regions and complexes have been undertaken during the recent couple of decades , predominantly focusing on the luminosity functions ( lfs ) , an important tool for deriving the birthrates and mass distribution of ob associations .",
    "these studies , mostly based on ground - based imaging in the hydrogen h@xmath0 emission line , have yielded a collection of remarkable results .",
    "notably , @xcite analysed a sample of 30 galaxies with hubble type ranging from sb to irr and found the locus of differential lfs to follow a power law expressed as @xmath4 for luminosities @xmath5 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "they also found that a subsample ( @xmath720% of the total ) of the galaxies is better described by a double power - law lf , which they termed `` type ii '' , with a break in the slope for luminosities @xmath8 erg s@xmath6. the h@xmath0 analyses of h ii region lfs were later extended to early - type ( sa ) spirals @xcite , h i - selected galaxies @xcite and low surface brightness galaxies @xcite .",
    "two conventions for the representation of the lfs exist in the literature , one for number counts binned linearly in luminosity , and the other binned logarithmically .",
    "we adopt the logarithmic formalism , @xmath9 , equivalent to @xmath10 ( note @xmath0 is generally negative ) .",
    "the existence of the slope break at an h@xmath0 luminosity of @xmath11 erg s@xmath6 is confirmed in the lf of m101 by @xcite , m51 by @xcite , eight other galaxies by @xcite , and more recently , in the co - added lf derived from the 18,000 h ii regions in 53 galaxies by @xcite .",
    "this high luminosity break is hence considered robust , and termed the strmgren luminosity by @xcite , in accordance to their hypothesis that the break results from a transition from ionization - bounded to density - bounded h ii regions .",
    "conversely , @xcite suggest that the luminosity limit @xmath12 erg s@xmath6 is linked to the regions transitioning from stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) to full sampling .",
    "the ground - based h@xmath0 lfs generally show a `` type ii '' profile when a steep slope at the bright end ( @xmath13 ) is connected to a flatter one in the less luminous regime ( @xmath14(0.30.5 ) , see ",
    "[ sec : h2lf_ind ] for pa@xmath0 lfs of individual galaxies ) . here and throughout this section",
    ", h ii regions brighter ( fainter ) than @xmath15 are called _ super - break _ ( _ sub - break _ ) , and the quantities that describe their behavior are marked with a subscript `` br@xmath16 '' ( `` br@xmath17'').    the hypothesis that the break in the slope has a physical nature rather than being an observational artifact has been under suspicion for long , especially when considering that the resolution of ground - based images , dominated by seeing , ranges from 08 to 34 , corresponding to up to @xmath7400 pc at a distance of 20 mpc . the ground - based work is potentially hindered by blending of adjacent ( spatially or in projection ) h ii regions .",
    "this results in an artificially pumped - up bright end of the number distribution together with a depleted faint end . as shown by @xcite",
    ", measuring the properties of h ii regions reliably requires a linear resolution of @xmath740 pc or better , translating to an angular resolution of @xmath180.4  for a galaxy located 20 mpc away . the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , which has a @xmath10.3   resolution ( actual value depending on the instrument ) , is thus an ideal facility to tackle the h ii region statistics .    the high angular resolution of the hst data motivated @xcite and @xcite to scrutinize the previous conclusions drawn for m51 and m101 , respectively , using hst h@xmath0 images .",
    "interestingly , neither of the two galaxies shows evidence for the broken power - law h@xmath0 lf obtained in ground - based studies . both galaxies exhibit a single power - law lf characterized by @xmath19 , or equivalently , @xmath20 , which is much steeper than previously determined @xmath21 values .",
    "these values of @xmath21 are consistent with results on the luminosity and mass functions of star clusters ( e.g. , a recent analysis of hst wfc3 data of m83 and m51 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , both galaxies contain only a small amount ( @xmath22 of the total ) of super - break h ii regions .",
    "this result indicates that super - break h ii regions may not exist after all , but are simply blends of multiple regions and associated diffuse gas . if this is correct , the break at @xmath15 is actually where the power law scaling truncates .",
    "the discrepancy between these hst analyses of two galaxies and the more extensive previous ground - based work brings urgency to a more systematic investigation using the high angular resolution data of the hst .",
    "although the more recent hst study by @xcite finds evidence for the existence of a break luminosity in the h ii lf of m51 , the break occurs at a luminosity fainter than the type ii lf break by a factor of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 erg s@xmath6 ) and is thus likely to have a different origin .",
    "meanwhile , the upper cutoff of the h ii lf of m31 is below the type ii lf break luminosity , disqualifying this galaxy for testing the above discrepancy @xcite .",
    "far less investigated than the impact of blending is the effect of dust attenuation on the derivation of the lfs .",
    "variable dust attenuation across galactic disks induces scatter on the measurements .",
    "furthermore , since brighter h ii regions are generally associated with larger extinctions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the presence of dust can hinder accurate derivations of h ii lfs and also the verification of the presence of a luminosity truncation , as discussed in @xcite . less susceptible to dust attenuation , near - ir tracers of current star formation activity , such as the paschen or brackett emission lines , can be used as good alternatives to h@xmath0 and other optical tracers .",
    "such measurements are only available for very limited samples , but an hst / nicmos pa@xmath0 survey of the central @xmath71  field of 84 nearby galaxies has been recently completed ( pi : daniela calzetti , go : 11080 ) .",
    "the pa@xmath0 hydrogen line emission , with a central rest - frame wavelength of 1.8756 @xmath25 m , suffers much less from dust attenuation than h@xmath0 .",
    "the visual extinctions of individual h ii regions in the almost face - on spirals like m51 can reach values as high as @xmath26 mag @xcite , implying that the h@xmath0 line is dimmed by two orders of magnitude , but pa@xmath0 only a factor of @xmath72 .",
    "in general , we expect a 20% dimming factor for pa@xmath0 to be more typical in nearby disk galaxies @xcite .    in parallel to the lf investigations ,",
    "the size distribution of the h ii regions , physically related to the lf , has also been studied at length ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , @xcite compiled and refitted the data in the literature and suggest that the differential nebular size distribution follows a power law of the form @xmath27 , with flattening at diameters below @xmath7260 pc .",
    "although the regions that enter in the power - law distribution are clearly blends of multiple smaller objects , their investigation provides important clues to the clustering properties of h ii regions .",
    "hst is relatively insensitive to the low surface brightness emission from the diffuse ionized gas , due to its intrinsic high angular resolution @xcite .",
    "thus , our hst pa@xmath0 images are only sensitive to the compact emission from associations of relatively massive ( @xmath2830  @xmath29 ) , young ( @xmath18810 myr ) stars .",
    "this feature , in addition to its high angular resolution , further makes characterizing h ii regions more reliable , as the associated diffuse gas also plays an important role in preventing h ii regions from being de - blended @xcite .",
    "we select 12 spirals out of the 84 targets in our hst / nicmos program to construct our sample so that every member contains at least 50 well - detected h ii regions ( see   [ sec : sample ] for further details ) .",
    "our sample ranges from sb to sd in morphological type ( see table  [ tbl : sample ] ) ; these are later types than the sample as a whole , and is a result of the bias introduced by the requirement that each galaxy contains an appreciable number of h ii regions .",
    "this is our best sample to infer the intrinsic ( i.e. , minimally affected by blending and dust attenuation ) luminosity function of h ii regions with high accuracy .",
    "this work is the first systematic investigation of the h ii region statistics utilizing the hst pa@xmath0 images of a significant galaxy sample .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  2 describes the basic properties of our galaxy sample , provides some detail on the data reduction and the identification and photometry of h ii regions ;  3 presents our analysis of h ii luminosity function and size distribution in individual galaxies ;  4 is devoted to the analysis of co - added h ii region distributions by combining the whole sample , and its comparison to previous ground - based studies in h@xmath0 ; the results are discussed in  5 and summarized in  6 .",
    "the galaxies analyzed in the present paper are selected from a recent hst / nicmos survey of the central @xmath71  field of 84 nearby galaxies evenly distributed across all hubble and bar types ( hst / go11080 ) .",
    "targeting the redshifted hydrogen pa@xmath0 emission line using the nic3 camera , these observations were completed in february 2008 .    in order to optimize our analysis ,",
    "we down - select a sub - sample from the original list of 84 galaxies according to the following criteria :    1 .",
    "highly inclined spirals ( @xmath30 ) are excluded to avoid severe blending of overlapping ( in projection ) h ii regions .",
    "galaxies with heliocentric recession velocities higher than 1600 km s@xmath6 are rejected . for larger redshifts ,",
    "the throughput of f187n filter is low , leading to a large transmittance correction which yields uncertain pa@xmath0 fluxes .",
    "3 .   to ensure the fidelity of the statistical analysis",
    ", a galaxy is rejected if it contains fewer than 50 h ii regions detected with signal - to - noise ratio @xmath31 within the field of view ( fov ) of the nic3 camera .",
    "if the galaxy hosts a central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , these h ii regions need to be @xmath32200 pc from the galaxy center to avoid contamination from it . as a reference",
    ", our observations cover the central 5  kpc or less of each galaxy .",
    "only spirals located within 23 mpc are considered , implying a worst spatial resolution of 29 pc ( for the 0.26  resolution of our nic3 images , see next section ) , well below the 40 pc maximum size suggested by @xcite for reliably measuring h ii region properties .",
    "the above selection procedure filters out 6/7 of the original sample , leaving 12 spiral galaxies .",
    "the hubble type of these selected galaxies ranges from sab to sd , which , as mentioned in the introduction , is due to the third selection criteria that biases the sample towards later type spirals .",
    "the basic properties of our sample galaxies are summarized in table  [ tbl : sample ] .",

    "to test this , we run simulations by placing artificial sources onto the pa@xmath0 maps with gaussian profiles , varying the luminosities and sizes of the sources , and running _ hiiphot _ using the same parameter setting as for the respective galaxies to see if they can be identified . fainter and more extended h ii regions are harder to detect , which forms an envelope below which the regions are not identified by the algorithm .",

    "we now proceed to quantify the effect of using a specific algorithm for identifying and measuring h ii regions ( in our case : _ hiiphot _ ) and how this plays out for varying noise levels in the data .",

    "each region is represented by a two - dimensional gaussian profile whose integrated flux is the assigned luminosity and whose fwhm satisfies @xmath113 ( the coefficient is adjusted to roughly match the observed size range ) . when we assign a random position to each region , we create a noiseless simulated image . in order to examine the variation of the @xmath83@xmath76 relation at different noise levels , we multiply the noise map by a `` noise boosting factor '' which varies from 0 , 0.1 , 0.5 and 1 , 2 , 3 , ... to 8 progressively before adding it to the noiseless image to create a set of final simulated images . using a parameter setting identical to what was applied to ngc 1097",

    "even when the noise boosting factor is 0 ( noiseless data ) , we do not retrieve the input @xmath87 , but find a significantly flatter slope ( @xmath115 ) , close to the average value in our sample , @xmath109 .",
    "thus , the h ii region retrieval algorithm has a measurable effect on the recovered @xmath79 .",

    ", we conclude that the value of @xmath79 decreases and reaches an asymptote of @xmath72 as the noise in the image increases , or , analogously , as the signal - to - noise ratio of the h ii regions decreases .",
    "if the minimum h ii region that can be detected in a galaxy is ionized by a cluster containing a single o7.5 star , the corresponding pa@xmath0 luminosity is @xmath116 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "a faint - end luminosity cutoff has also the property of flattening the @xmath83@xmath76 relation , almost irrespective of the level of blending . running monte carlo simulations ,",
    "we recover smaller values of @xmath79 corresponding to @xmath1170.5 , for the cut - off above , even when the data are noiseless . higher cut - off luminosities yield stronger flattening for @xmath79 .    in summary ,",
    "the exponent of the @xmath83@xmath76 relation , @xmath79 , is subject to variations that are unrelated to intrinsic physical changes in the properties of the h ii regions , but are most likely induced by observational biases , as already noted by @xcite .",
    "however , not all observational biases work in the direction of yielding smaller - than - true values of @xmath79 . for instance , our simulations indicate that source blending steepens the @xmath83@xmath76 relation to values @xmath96 .",
    "conversely , @xmath79 flattens to values @xmath118 , and approaches @xmath110 in the presence of both decreasing signal - to - noise data and a faint - end cut - off to the luminosity function of h ii regions .",
    "the use of the algorithm _ hiiphot _ to identify and measure the h ii regions also has some role in recovering values of @xmath114 . instead , the use of either h@xmath0 or pa@xmath0 images to perform the analysis has negligible impact on the recovered values of @xmath79 .    in light of the above",
    ", we can interpret both @xmath110 as measured by @xcite in m51 , and the radial profile of @xmath79 in the same galaxy ( figure [ fig : m51_eta ] ) .",
    "in the center of the galaxy , significant blending yields @xmath96 , but , as the galactocentric distance increases , both source blending and the overall signal - to - noise ratio in the image decrease , thus reducing @xmath79 .",

    "we therefore consider @xmath7100 pc the characteristic scale that differentiates the two h ii region populations which construct their respective power scalings on either side of the break luminosity , if the break is real . excluding regions that have sizes @xmath154 pc , the power index of the co - added luminosity function for sub - break regions becomes slightly steeper ( @xmath155 ) than otherwise ( @xmath156 ) , and slightly more consistent with the mean slope for individual galaxies , @xmath57 .",

    "although excluding these objects from the co - added analysis will impose a further criterion that may bias our sample , including them for testing the existence of the break raises concerns , as well .",
    "in fact , we find that removing these galaxies from the sample will only flatten the sub - break power index slightly ( @xmath157 ) , and the ( in)significance of the break and discontinuity remains unchanged , because the majority of the h ii regions contributed by these four galaxies are fainter than the completeness limit ( 10@xmath140 erg s@xmath6 )",

    "for the whole sample , we find a median value for the lf power index @xmath58 .",
    "the size distribution of h ii regions , fitted to @xmath176 , shows significantly larger variation of the exponent than the lf , with two galaxies showing no apparent power scaling at all . excluding these two objects , we find the median value @xmath177 , consistent with @xmath131 found by @xcite .",
    "the co - added lf can be fitted by a single power law with an exponent of @xmath141 over a luminosity range of 1.6 orders of magnitude , but a possible break is seen at @xmath143 erg s@xmath6 , roughly corresponding to the transition luminosity determined by ground - based h@xmath0 observations . when fitted with a disconnected double power law , the co - added lf has a best - fit power index @xmath146 for the brighter regions and @xmath147 for the fainter ones .",

    "<S> the h ii region luminosity function ( lf ) is an important tool for deriving the birthrates and mass distribution of ob associations , and is an excellent tracer of the newly formed massive stars and associations . to date , extensive work ( predominantly in h@xmath0 ) has been done from the ground , which is hindered by dust extinction and the severe blending of adjacent ( spatially or in projection ) h ii regions . reliably measuring the properties of h ii regions requires a linear resolution @xmath140 pc , but analyses satisfying this requirement have been done only in a handful of galaxies , so far . as the first space - based work using a galaxy sample , we have selected 12 galaxies from our hst nicmos pa@xmath0 survey and studied the luminosity function and size distribution of h ii regions both in individual galaxies and cumulatively , using a virtually extinction - free tracer of the ionizing photon rate . </S>",
    "<S> the high angular resolution and low sensitivity to diffuse emission of nicmos also offer an advantage over ground - based imaging by enabling a higher degree of de - blending of the h ii regions . </S>",
    "<S> we do not confirm the broken power - law lfs found in ground - based studies . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we find that the lfs , both individual and co - added , follow a single power law @xmath2 , consistent with the mass function of star clusters in nearby galaxies , and in agreement with the results of the existing analyses with hst data . </S>",
    "<S> the individual and co - added size distribution of h ii regions are both roughly consistent with @xmath3 , but the power - law scaling is probably contaminated by blended regions or complexes . </S>"
