    "xmm - newton has the advantage of high spectral resolution and large field of view ( fov ) for detailed studies .",
    "this helps us to compose an almost volume complete sample of 13 distant , x - ray luminous ( dxl ; @xmath3 to @xmath4 ; @xmath5 for @xmath6 ) galaxy clusters and one supplementary cluster at @xmath7 from the rosat - eso flux - limited x - ray ( reflex ; bhringer et al .",

    "we correct the volume completeness with a known selection function for distant , x - ray luminous clusters ( @xmath5 ) as described in bhringer et al .",
    "( 2005 ; paper  i ) .",
    "a prime goal for the study of the reflex - dxl sample is to obtain spatially resolved icm properties such as the temperature ( zhang et al .",
    "2004a ; paperii ) , to derive accurate measurements of the cluster mass and gas mass fraction , and to study the peculiarities in the cluster structure which introduce a scatter in the scaling relations .",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath8cdm cosmology with @xmath9 and @xmath10  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 .",
    "confidence intervals correspond to the 68% confidence level .",

    "we create an oot event list file and statistically remove the oot effect . to avoid the episodes of `` soft proton flares '' ( de luca & molendi 2004 )",
    ", we use a threshold of @xmath12 clipping to clean the data in both the hard band ( 1012  kev band and 1214  kev band for mos and pn , respectively ) and the soft band ( 0.310  kev band ) .    over half of the clusters",
    "clearly show substructures or / and elongation .",
    "we use `` edetect_chain '' to detect point - like sources .",
    "we subtract the substructures and point - like sources leaving only the main component .",
    "the observations of rxcj2011.3@xmath135725 are contaminated by flares .",
    "thus we only obtain a global temperature ( @xmath14  kev ) .",
    "some properties of these observations and an overview of the sample are described in paperi .",
    "we obtained the temperature profiles of 9 reflex - dxl clusters in paperii .",
    "also included in this paper are the observational parameters , alternative names , data preparation and double background subtraction method which is developed to provide a precise spectral background removal .",
    "we apply the xmm - newton blank sky pointings in the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) as background .",
    "we have considered the projection effects over the line of sight in the temperature and surface brightness measurements .",
    "we have accounted for the psf effect for surface brightness . in the spectral analysis , we have applied a large radial binning , greater than @xmath15 , to reduce the psf effect instead of accounted for the psf blurring completely because of limited photon statistics .",
    "this should be considered for the reliability of the temperature profiles in the central part . for such distant clusters ,",
    "the psf effect is important within @xmath16 which introduces an added uncertainty to the final results .",
    "this can only be investigated using deep exposures with better photon statistics .",
    "[ figure3 ]      we perform the spectral analysis in five annuli : 00.5@xmath17 , 0.51@xmath17 , 12@xmath17 , 24@xmath17 , and 48@xmath17 , to measure the temperature profiles .",
    "we applied both the residual spectrum ( e.g. arnaud et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang et al . 2005 ) and a `` powerlaw '' model ( zhang et al .",
    "2004a ) to account for the residual background in the double background subtraction method ( zhang et al .",
    "2004a ) for spectral background removal .",
    "we found that the two methods provide consistent results within 1  @xmath18 error except for the last annulus for rxcj0232.2@xmath134420 and rxcj1131.9@xmath131955 .",
    "the disagreement is caused by the underestimate / overestimate of the formal errors in the measurements using a residual model / spectrum .",
    "we deprojected the temperature profiles and found consistent results within 1  @xmath18 error bars .",
    "we apply the global spectral temperatures and @xmath19 to scale the temperature profiles ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) . excluding the individual data points with error bars over 150% of the mean value , we derived a weighted temperature profile of the reflex - dxl clusters .",
    "we found a closely self - similar behavior with a constant distribution at @xmath20 and a decrease at @xmath21 .",
    "this averaged temperature profile keeps an overall agreement with the one in markevitch et al .",
    "a similar universal temperature profile is indicated in simulations ( borgani et al .",
    "2004 ; borgani 2004 ) .",
    "we choose the 0.52  kev band to derive surface brightness profiles ( also see zhang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "this provides an almost temperature - independent x - ray emission coefficient over the expected temperature range .",
    "we derive the azimuthally averaged surface brightness of the xmm - newton blank sky pointings in the same detector coordinates as for the targets .",
    "the count rate ratio of the targets and cdfs in the 1012  kev band and 1214  kev band for mos and pn , respectively is used to scale the cdfs surface brightness .",
    "the data are rebinned to ensure ( 1 ) at leat 100 counts ( 30 counts for a limited photon statistics case ) per bin , and ( 2 ) 3-@xmath18 source count rate .",
    "we subtract the scaled cdfs surface brightness and obtain the surface brightness including the cluster surface brightness and a residual soft x - ray background .",
    "this residual background is flat over the fov .",
    "it is estimated in the outer region ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we fit the cluster surface brightness profile by a surface brightness prediction convolved with the xmm - newton point spread function ( psf ; ghizzardi 2001 ) .",

    "a @xmath24-model provides a satisfying @xmath25 fit of the surface brightness profiles in the observed radial range .",
    "the surface brightness profiles ( see fig .  [ figure2 ] ) are scaled according to the standard self - similar model ( e.g. arnaud et al . 2002 ) and show a good self - similarity in the @xmath1 region .",
    "surface brightness profiles can be deprojected to yield the emission per volume element , @xmath26 .",
    "this is used to derive icm density distributions .    for non - cooling flow clusters ( nccs ) ,",
    "we make use of the temperature profile and density profile to derive the mass , assuming spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the xmm - newton mass measurements of the nccs are consistent with the masses derived from the global temperatures using the observational @xmath27@xmath28 relation based on the conventional @xmath24 model for the x - ray surface brightness profile and hydrostatic equilibrium for 22 nearby clusters from xu et al .",

    "( 1997 ; @xmath29 ; nfw ) describe a universal density profile for dark halos from numerical simulations in hierarchical clustering scenarios .",

    "an extended - nfw model from recent simulations ( e.g. diemand et al . 2004 ; navarro et al .",

    ", we make use of the deprojected temperature profile and density profile to parameterize the ext - nfw model under the assumptions of hydrostatic equilibrium , polytropic gas and spherical symmetry .",
    "then the mass is derived from the ext - nfw model .    the typical uncertainty of the mass increases from 1040% to 2580% from the inner parts to the outer parts .",
    "the nccs / ccs show shallow / steep mass profiles at the inner parts ( fig .",

    "x - ray luminous ( massive ) galaxy clusters such as the clusters in this paper show a self - similar behavior of their properties , e.g. temperature , density and mass in the @xmath1 region in which we have a good understanding of dark matter .",
    "peculiarities in the cluster structure introduce a scatter from the self - similar frame in the cluster cores which is due to physical processes rather than simply being statistical fluctuations in the measurement ( zhang et al .",
    "for example , mergers can not only lead to a temporary increase in the cluster temperature and x - ray luminosity ( randall et al .",
    "2002 ) , but also reduce the surface brightness slope and increase the core radius particular in on - going cluster mergers ( markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ) , e.g. rxcj0658.5@xmath135556 and rxcj0516.7@xmath135430 in our sample . many studies ( e.g. markevitch et al .",
    "2002 ; randall et al .",
    "2002 ) indicate that the x - ray mass estimate in the center could be biased by the phenomena such as ghost cavities and bubbles that may somehow invalidate the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis .",
