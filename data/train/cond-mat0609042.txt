    "within the last decade a new idea has revolutionised electronic devices : to use the spin of electrons in addition to its charge .",
    "this field of application is called spintronics @xcite . half - metallic ferromagnets ( hmf )",
    "seem to be a suitable class of materials which meet all requirements of spintronics .",
    "one reason is their exceptional electronic structure : they are metals in one spin direction and semiconductors in the other .",
    "the half - heusler compound nimnsb was the first material being predicted by electronic structure calculations to be a hmf @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been made to prepare semi - conducting compounds which also have ferromagnetic properties .",
    "mn - doped gaas was considered to be a suitable compound , but its curie temperature is only about 150  k @xcite and thus still far away from being suitable for application in electronic devices ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "heusler compounds exhibit a large variety of different electronic and magnetic properties ranging from semi - conducting to ferromagnetic .",
    "this work focuses on the search for suitable compounds that bridge both semi - conducting and ferromagnetic properties . in particular , the research concentrates on finding half - metallic ferromagnetic half - heusler alloys with transition temperatures well above room temperature .",
    "coti@xmath2fe@xmath3sb samples were prepared by arc melting of stoichiometric amounts of the constituents in an argon atmosphere at 10@xmath4  mbar .",
    "the polycrystalline ingots were then annealed in an evacuated quartz tube at 1000  k for 7  days .",
    "the electronic structure was calculated for pure and fe doped cotisb in order to examine their electronic and magnetic structure .",
    "self consistent calculations were performed by means of the full - relativistic , spin polarised korringa - kohn - rostocker ( kkr ) method in combination with coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite . as predicted by tobola _",
    "et al _ @xcite , cotisb turned out to be a semiconductor with a gap at the fermi energy for both spin directions .",
    "partial replacement of titanium by iron ( 10% ) ( assuming that fe is statistically distributed on the ti positions ) , has the result that the semiconductor is converted into a hmf : the dos at the fermi energy is clearly different from zero for only one spin direction , while remaining zero for the other . measurements of the conductivity revealed the metallic character of the fe - doped samples in contrast to the semi - conducting behaviour of the pure sample .",
    "it was carefully proved that fe occupies ti positions and not an other vacant site . for that purpose ,",
    "the x - ray powder diffraction pattern of the iron - substituted compounds were compared to that from pure cotisb .",
    "it was observed that no additional diffraction reflexes appear up to 10% fe - doping , thus confirming that the structure remains the same as of pure cotisb , that is c1@xmath5 .",
    "the diffraction pattern of the pure and a 10% fe doped sample are compared in fig.[fig-1 ] .",
    "the lattice parameter @xmath6 nm for cotisb changes slightly ( 0.1% ) if 10% of ti is replaced by fe .",
    "the r values for the best fit in the rietveld refinement are r@xmath7 = 6% and r@xmath8 = 11% confirming the high degree of site order of the sample .",
    "the magnetic properties were investigated by means of magnetometry ( squid ) . to determine the saturation magnetisation hysteresis loops of the coti@xmath2fe@xmath3sb samples for @xmath9 , 0.02 , 0.05 and 0.1 were measured .",
    "already the sample with only 1% fe exhibit ferromagnetism at room temperature .",
    "the total spin magnetic moment of the samples can be predicted from the generalised slater - pauling rule @xcite to be : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of valence electrons per unit cell .",
    "cotisb carries no magnetic moment according to the slater - pauling rule because it has overall 18 valence electrons .",
    "doping fe on the ti positions should lead to a magnetic moment . in the case of",
    "coti@xmath12fe@xmath13sb one can predict from the slater - pauling rule a saturation magnetisation of 0.4  @xmath14 per formula unit due to the 18.4 valence electrons of the compound . in fig.[fig-2 ] .",
    "the hysteresis loops of coti@xmath12fe@xmath13sb at 5k , 300k and 768k are shown .",
    "ferromagnetic behaviour is still observed at 768k which points to a very high curie temperature .",
    "the saturation magnetisation at 768k has still half of the value at 5k .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments for the fe - doped samples fit as well as the experimental values to the values one expected from the slater - pauling rule ( see inset fig.2 ) .    for more details and other properties of the series of coti@xmath2fe@xmath3sb with the fe concentration ranging from @xmath15 to 0.1 see ref.@xcite .",
    "in summary , it was shown that fe substituted + coti@xmath2fe@xmath3sb is a new diluted semiconductor with a high curie temperature of above 770k .",
    "self consistent band structure calculations predict the alloy to exhibit half - metallic ferromagnetism .",
    "the future idea is to design devices which consist of alternating semi - conducting cotisb and half - metallic ferromagnetic coti@xmath2fe@xmath3sb layers . in that case",
    ", one may be able to design a device with the semi - conducting and ferromagnetic parts being of almost the same material ."
