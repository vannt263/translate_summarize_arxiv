    "alcubierre s warp drive spacetime ( @xcite ) allows effective superluminal travel within general relativity .",
    "as remarked by alcubierre himself , it requires negative energy densities , and there are reasons to believe that all spacetimes allowing superluminal travel must violate energy conditions ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another feature is the existence of horizons ( @xcite ) , which has been argued on general grounds to be unavoidable ( @xcite ) .",
    "the traditional heuristic explanation of how the warp drive spacetime works is that space in front of a given region ( the `` warp bubble '' ) is contracted , whereas space behind the same region is expanded . in response , the warp bubble moves forwards with a speed determined by the contraction / expansion rate .",
    "we will show in this paper that this contraction / expansion is not necessary at all , and that in particular it is possible to construct a similar spacetime where no contraction / expansion occurs .",
    "heuristically , one could best describe the warp drive spacetime as `` sliding '' the warp bubble region through space ; space in front of the bubble may get contracted ( and space behind it expanded ) , or not , depending on the details of the construction .    the paper is divided in three sections .    in the first section we define the warp drive spacetime generated by any ( time - dependent ) vector field @xmath0 in euclidean 3-space .",
    "this is a globally hyperbolic spacetime foliated by euclidean 3-spaces such that the integral lines of * x * represent timelike geodesics ( corresponding to the so - called _ eulerian observers _ ) .",
    "we show that such spacetimes always violate some energy condition , and compute the expansion of the eulerian observers volume element to be @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we show how alcubierre s warp drive can be obtained from a particular choice of @xmath0 .    in the second section , we explicitly construct a volume - preserving warp drive by selecting an appropriate divergenceless vector field @xmath0 .    in the third section , we take advantage of the formalism developed thus far to analyse some simple examples , and find them to possess horizons and infinite blueshifts .",
    "these results are similar to those obtained ( some numerically ) in @xcite , but independent of the particular choice of warp drive , and perhaps easier to visualize .",
    "a _ warp drive spacetime _ is a globally hyperbolic spacetime @xmath2 , where @xmath3 with the usual cartesian coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 is given by the line element as _ numerical _ indices running from 1 to 3 and referring either to the space coordinates @xmath6 or to space components in an orthonormal frame including @xmath7 . ]",
    "@xmath8 for three unspecified bounded smooth functions @xmath9 .",
    "notice that the riemannian metric @xmath10 induced in the cauchy surfaces @xmath11 is just the ordinary euclidean flat metric .",
    "a warp drive spacetime is completely defined by the vector field @xmath12 which we can think of as a ( time - dependent ) vector field defined in euclidean 3-space .",
    "the future - pointing unit normal covector to the cauchy surfaces is @xmath13    the observers whose 4-velocity is @xmath14 are said to be the _",
    "eulerian observers_.    eulerian observers are free - fall observers .",
    "using the geodesic lagrangian , @xmath15,\\ ] ] it is a simple matter to write down the geodesic equations : @xmath16 it is immediate to check that any curve satisfying @xmath17 is a solution of these equations .",
    "the extrinsic curvature tensor associated to the foliation of a warp drive spacetime by the cauchy surfaces @xmath11 is @xmath18    as is well known , the extrinsic curvature tensor is given by @xmath19 now @xmath20 on the other hand , since @xmath0 is tangent to the cauchy surfaces , we can use the usual formula for the lie derivative of the metric , @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the levi - civita connection determined by @xmath10 . since @xmath10 is just the flat euclidean metric , @xmath23 and we get the formula above .",
    "the expansion of the volume element associated with the eulerian observers is @xmath24 .",
    "we just have to notice that @xmath25    a warp drive spacetime is flat wherever @xmath26 is a killing vector field for the euclidean metric ( irrespective of time dependence ) .",
    "in particular , a warp drive spacetime is flat wherever @xmath26 is spatially constant .",
    "since the cauchy surfaces are flat , all curvature comes from the extrinsic curvature .",
    "thus the spacetime will be flat wherever the extrinsic curvature is zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , wherever @xmath27 .",
    "non flat warp drive spacetimes violate either the weak or the strong energy condition .",
    "if the strong energy condition holds and @xmath28 at some event , then @xmath29 blows up in finite time ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath1 is finite , the strong energy condition can only hold if @xmath30 .",
    "however , it follows from einstein s field equations that the energy density measured by eulerian observers is ( see @xcite ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the scalar curvature of the flat cauchy surfaces @xmath33 .",
    "thus if @xmath34 we have @xmath35 , and @xmath36 _ iff _ @xmath37 . consequently if the spacetime does not violate neither the strong nor the weak energy conditions it must be flat .",
    "alcubierre s warp drive ( see @xcite ) is obtained by choosing @xmath38 with @xmath39^\\frac12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a smooth function @xmath40 $ ] approximating a step function equal to @xmath41 in a neighbourhood of the origin and equal to @xmath42 in a neighbourhood of infinity , and an arbitrary function @xmath43 .",
    "if we call the region @xmath44 the _ interior of the warp bubble _ and the region @xmath45 the _ exterior of the warp bubble _ , we see that both these regions are flat ; nevertheless , eulerian observers inside the warp bubble move with arbitrary speed @xmath46 with respect to eulerian observers outside the warp bubble .",
    "it is a simple matter to obtain the expansion of the volume element associated with the eulerian observers and the energy density measured by eulerian observers in this example : @xmath47   \\\\ & \\,\\,\\,\\ , = -\\frac{1}{32\\pi}v_s^2 \\left [ f'(r_s)\\right]^2 \\frac{y^2+z^2}{r_s^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is convenient to replace the @xmath48 coordinate with @xmath49 this effectively corresponds to replacing @xmath50 with @xmath51 , so that the eulerian observers inside the bubble stand still whereas the eulerian observers outside the bubble move with speed @xmath46 in the negative @xmath52-direction .",
    "obviously @xmath29 and @xmath53 retain their values , but now @xmath54 does not depend on the coordinate @xmath55 .",
    "the vector field * x * is said to _ generate a warp bubble with velocity _",
    "@xmath56 if @xmath57 for small @xmath58 ( the _ interior of the warp bubble _ ) and @xmath59 for large @xmath58 ( the _ exterior of the warp bubble _ ) , where @xmath60",
    "we introduce spherical coordinates @xmath61 in the euclidean 3-space with the @xmath48 axis as the polar axis . using the usual isomorphism @xmath62 provided by the euclidean metric and the hodge star , given in spherical coordinates by @xmath63 we have @xmath64 consequently if we set @xmath65 \\sim -2v_s f\\cos\\theta { \\bf e}_r+v_s(2f+rf')\\sin \\theta { \\bf e}_\\theta\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath66 for large @xmath67 and @xmath68 for small @xmath67 , we are guaranteed to have a divergenceless field generating a warp bubble with velocity @xmath69 .",
    "interestingly , formulae for the extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath70 in spherical coordinates are available , as this corresponds to the so - called _ rate - of - strain _ tensor of fluid mechanics ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "if we set @xmath71 we have @xmath72=v_s\\sin\\theta\\left(f'+\\frac{r}2f''\\right ) ; \\\\ & k_{r\\varphi}=\\frac12 \\left [ r\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(\\frac{x^\\varphi}{r}\\right)+\\frac1{r\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial x^r}{\\partial \\varphi}\\right]=0 ; \\\\ & k_{\\theta\\varphi}=\\frac12 \\left [ \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}\\left(\\frac{x^\\varphi}{\\sin \\theta}\\right)+\\frac1{r\\sin\\theta}\\frac{\\partial x^\\theta}{\\partial \\varphi}\\right]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] yielding the energy density ( as measured by eulerian observers ) @xmath73.\\ ] ] notice that @xmath74 as it should . this gives some insight into the geometry of this spacetime : for example for @xmath75 ( i.e. , in front of the bubble ) , @xmath76 where @xmath77 ( i.e. , in the bubble s wall ) , indicating a compression in the radial direction ; this is however exactly balanced by @xmath78 , corresponding to an expansion in the perpendicular direction .",
    "besides violating energy conditions , warp drive spacetimes may have other pathologies , such as horizons and infinite blueshifts . to see evidence of this ,",
    "let us consider the case of a vector field @xmath0 generating a warp bubble with velocity @xmath79 satisfying @xmath80 notice that @xmath81 and hence such spacetime can only be stationary if @xmath82 .",
    "let us take @xmath83 .",
    "since null geodesics must satisfy @xmath84 we see that a flash of light outside the warp bubble can be pictured in the euclidean 3-space as a spherical wavefront which is simultaneously expanding with speed 1 and moving in the direction of @xmath0 with speed @xmath85 .",
    "thus it is clear that events inside the warp bubble can not causally influence events outside the warp bubble at large positive values of @xmath48 .",
    "assuming cylindrical symmetry about the @xmath48-axis , there will be a point on the positive @xmath48-axis where @xmath86 ; the cylindrically symmetric surface through this point whose angle @xmath87 with @xmath0 is given by @xmath88 is a horizon , in the sense that events inside the warp bubble can not causally influence events on the other side of this surface ( see figure [ horizon ] ) .",
    "notice that away from the warp bubble we have @xmath89 which is the familiar expression for the mach cone angle .",
    "notice also that the interior of the warp bubble is causally disconnected from part of the bubble s wall , as is unavoidable ( see @xcite ) .        inside and outside the warp bubble , the warp drive spacetime is flat , and hence the null geodesics are straight lines .",
    "if we assume that the warp bubble s wall is very thin , to study light rays crossing it all we have to decide is how much these light rays are refracted .",
    "according to the _",
    "fermat principle _ of general relativity ( see @xcite ) , and since the proper time of an eulerian observer inside the bubble is just @xmath55 , we must minimize the @xmath55 coordinate of the event at which the observer sees the light ray .",
    "if we choose the observer sitting at the centre of the bubble , light from every point in the bubble s wall will reach him simultaneously ; thus this observer will see the first light ray emitted at a given event to reach the warp bubble s wall .",
    "if @xmath90 is the position of the light ray at time coordinate @xmath55 , the unit vector @xmath91 is orthogonal to the wavefront ( and in fact represents the direction of the corresponding light ray from the point of view of a eulerian observer outside the warp bubble ) . the first light ray to reach the warp bubble",
    "will do so at a tangency between the wavefront and the warp bubble",
    ". therefore @xmath92 must be orthogonal to the warp bubble , and will therefore coincide with the direction of the light ray _ inside _ the warp bubble ( see figure [ horizon2 ] ) .",
    "incidentally , there will be no aberration : the observer in the centre of the bubble will see light coming from the same direction as seen by an eulerian observer outside the bubble in the light ray s path ( measured by an eulerian observer inside the bubble ) in terms of the incidence angle @xmath93 ( measured by an eulerian observer outside the bubble ) at a point in the bubble s wall making an angle @xmath29 with the @xmath48-axis is @xmath94 thus by making @xmath46 large enough there will be light coming from arbitrary directions arbitrarily close to the centre of the bubble . ] .",
    "it is possible to show that this is the limit of the results obtained in @xcite as the thickness of bubble s wall tends to zero .",
    "if the thickness is finite , however , there will always be some aberration",
    ".        in this approximation , it is also very easy to understand the origin of the horizon : it marks the boundary of the set of points accessible to light rays emerging from the warp bubble .",
    "also , it is clear that the only some points which are visible from inside the warp bubble ; they are delimited by a surface similar to the horizon , which we call the _ visibility horizon _ ( see figure [ horizon3 ] ) .",
    "notice that this observer will see nothing at all from directions beyond the direction of the visibility horizon .",
    "we now compute redshifts . recall that the 4-velocity of eulerian observers satisfies @xmath95 ; consequently , the energy of a particle with 4-velocity @xmath96 is just @xmath97 . from the geodesic equations , we see that @xmath98 and hence @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the energy measured by the eulerian observers and @xmath101 is a constant ( corresponding to the energy measured by eulerian observers when @xmath57 , _",
    "i.e. _ , inside the bubble ) .",
    "thus the eulerian observer at the centre of the warp bubble will see a blueshift of @xmath102 for light directly in front of him , decreasing to @xmath41 for light coming at @xmath103 , and to zero for light at the edge of the visibility horizon .",
    "conversely , light emitted by the eulerian observer at the centre of the warp bubble towards his back will suffer a redshift of @xmath102 ; light rays emitted in directions approaching the horizon will become increasingly blueshifted , reaching infinite blueshift at the horizon ."
