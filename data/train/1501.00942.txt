    "the entanglement phenomenon is expected to be a useful resource for future quantum technologies .",
    "many applications , based on entanglement , have been investigated , like quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum imaging @xcite , quantum game theory @xcite , secure key quantum transmission @xcite , etc . to develop quantum technologies , based on entanglement ,",
    "the quantum community needs long time entangled quantum systems , which are free from noise .",
    "quantum systems are too evasive as they may loose their entanglement by external environmental interactions and can go for entanglement sudden death ( esd ) for finite time @xcite .",
    "so , dynamics of entanglement and its control under various environmental interactions conceptually underpinning the quantum information processing .",
    "dynamics in various quantum spin chains have been studied under dzyaloshisnhkii - moriya ( dm ) interaction @xcite .",
    "dm interaction is a useful resource in quantum information processing to entangle and disentangle the quantum systems .",

    "they proposed that by manipulating the probability amplitude of third qubit or qutrit and dm interaction strength one can control the entanglement between two qubits induced by dm interaction and hence in various quantum spin chains @xcite . at this point",
    ", we mention here that the same method may not only be used to control the entanglement , but it may also be used to free the bound entanglement @xcite in various bound entangled states .",
    "once the bound entangled states are free , then they can be distilled @xcite .",
    "the quantum states beyond the dimension @xmath0 have been classified in two categories like free entangled states and bound entangled states .",
    "free entangled states are distillable states or in other words noise free states . on the other hand ,",
    "bound entangled states are noisy states and no pure entanglement can be obtained by local operations and classical communication .",
    "it is difficult to use bound entangled states directly for practical quantum information processing .",
    "however , by providing additional resource , bound entanglement can be activated to increase the fidelity of quantum teleportation @xcite . up to now",
    "we do nt have satisfactory tools to quantify and detecting the bound entanglement .",
    "recently , the free entanglement production from bound entangled states is proposed by using the ancillary system which is coupled to the initial bound - entangled state via appropriate weak measurements @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider qutrit - qutrit bound entangled bipartite states proposed by horodecki @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to show that dm interaction can be a used as a useful agent to free the bound entangled state in two qutrit system .",

    "we have used reduction criterion to check the distillability of these states . using this criterion",

    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of qutrit ( a ) and qutrit ( b ) and @xmath3 is the interaction hamiltonian of qutrit ( b ) and qubit ( c ) .",
    "we consider uncoupled qutrit ( a ) and qutrit ( b ) , so @xmath2 is zero .",
    "now the hamiltonian becomes @xmath4 where @xmath5 is dm interaction between qutrit ( b ) and qubit ( c ) and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are associated vectors of qutrit ( b ) and qubit ( c ) respectively .",
    "we assume that dm interaction exist along the z - direction only . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian can be simplified as + @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are gell - mann matrices for qutrit ( b ) and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are x and y pauli matrices of qubit ( c ) respectively .",
    "the above hamiltonian is a matrix having @xmath13 dimension .",
    "further , it is multiplied by the identity matrix of dimension three and we obtained the dimension as @xmath14 .",
    "the matrix of hamiltonian is easy to diagonalize by using the method of eigendecomposition .",
    "the unitary time evolution operator is easily commutable as @xmath15 which is also a @xmath16 matrix .",
    "this matrix has been used to obtain the time evolution of density matrix of the system .",
