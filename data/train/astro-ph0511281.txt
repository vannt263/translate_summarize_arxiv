    "barnard s star ( gliese 699 ) is a well - studied , nearby ( d=1.8 pc , hnsch et al .",
    "1999 , giampapa et al . 1996 )",
    "m dwarf ( marino et al .",
    "2000 , hnsch et al .",
    "@xcite and @xcite classify it as an m4 dwarf , and @xcite provide a mass estimate of 0.144  m@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite measure a bolometric luminosity of ( 3.46@xmath50.17)x10@xmath3l@xmath6 , and infer a radius=0.200@xmath50.008   r@xmath6 , and effective temperature=3134@xmath5102 k.    barnard s star is considered to be a very old neighbor .",
    "@xcite find that barnard s star lies just below the main sequence , and may be a population ii subdwarf .",
    "it also has a very low quiescent x - ray luminosity ( e.g. , log(@xmath7)=26 , hnsch et al .",
    "1999 ; 26.1 , vaiana et al . 1981 ) , indicating only low level magnetic activity",
    "@xcite infer a rotation period of 130  days from interferometric photometry .",
    "the slow rotation is another indication of advanced age .",
    "low - level variability on barnard s star has been observed ( e.g. krster et al .",
    "2003 , benedict et al .",
    "1999 ) , as is common for m dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . additionally , very young",
    ", active m dwarfs typically show balmer line emission during quiesence .",
    "the balmer lines are not present ( either in absorption or in emission ) during quiescence @xcite in barnard s star .",
    "marino et al . ( 2000 ) noted that their measurement ( log(@xmath7)=25 ) of barnard s star was taken  in flare \" .",
    "additionally , @xcite may have caught barnard s star during a low - level flare , as they detect a slight emission in h@xmath8 . in this paper , we present a census of enhanced features , including the balmer series , during a flare event that we observed which is significantly stronger than the one in @xcite .",
    "the observation of flare events on old m dwarfs is difficult owing to their infrequency . as such ,",
    "most flares are caught only as snapshots and do not provide complete time coverage of the event .",
    "however , it is interesting to describe the isolated events that are observed and to attempt to place them in perspective compared to flares on well - studied flare stars , such as ad leo @xcite .",
    "the echelle spectra were obtained at mcdonald observatory s 2.7  m harlan j. smith telescope on july 17 , 1998 during planned observations for the mcdonald observatory planet search @xcite .",
    "when the star began flaring , two additional spectra were taken .",
    "the cross - dispersed coude echelle spectrograph was used along with the tk3 detector .",
    "the spectral coverage is almost complete from 3600   to 10800  .",
    "spectra are taken with resolution of @xmath160,000 and considering the spectral type of barnard s star and thus the low s / n in the bluest orders , we do not consider any spectral features below 3700   and we only include lines below @xmath13800   which are obviously in emission and easily identified .",
    "there are interorder gaps in the spectra redward of @xmath1 5800 .",
    "we note in the following sections when important lines fall in these gaps .",
    "all data were reduced with standard iraf echelle packages .",
    "the wavelength scale was derived using the spectrum of a thar calibration lamp .",
    "spectral orders with clearly defined continuua were fit with 5th order polynomials . for orders which do not have clearly defined continuua , we fit 3rd order polynomials to define a pseudo - continuum in regions near important lines ( e.g. in the order containing ca  ii  h  &  k",
    ", the regions just outside the h  &  k lines and in between the lines were used ) .",
    "absolute flux calibration of the spectra was not attempted .",
    "the first spectrum taken at 05:32:09.04 ut is in quiescence . the following spectrum ( f1 ) , taken immediately after the first at 06:06:09.42 ut , included the flare maximum .",
    "the third spectrum ( f2 ) , taken at 06:39:48.58 ut showed much less flare enhancement , indicating that the flare decayed rapidly .",
    "the quiescent spectrum and f1 were taken with the i@xmath9 cell in place .",
    "molecular i@xmath10 lines litter the spectrum between 5000 and 6200 .",
    "these lines subtract out for the most part when differencing these spectra ( for line identification ) but as a precaution , the lines we identify in @xmath113 .",
    "are those which are unambiguous ( i.e. @xmath04@xmath12 ) .",
    "because f2 was taken without the cell in place , the difference of f2 and quiescent spectra contain the i@xmath9 lines . for these reasons",
    ", we have not included the lines detected in f2 in @xmath113 except for the balmer lines which are sufficiently large for unambiguous detection , as described in @xmath113.2.1 .",
    "the continuum is enhanced during the flare , but this enhancement is difficult to measure in absolute terms from our echelle observations . we assume the relative calibrations as described in @xmath113.2.1 are reasonable , and we thus provide continuum increases for various wavelength intervals in table 1 .",
    "the flare clearly shows a strong blue color as is typically seen in stellar flares @xcite . a lower limit to the temperature of the flare can be estimated assuming the continuum peaks at our bluest wavelength observed .",
    "this gives an estimate of a blackbody temperature @xmath0 8000 k. this is similar to the temperature derived during an unusually large flare on the k dwarf lq  hya @xcite and to temperatures derived for other flares on m dwarfs ( e.g. , hawley et al 2003 ) .",
    "table 2 lists the dominant lines filled - in or in emission during the flare which are included in the wavelength span of our data and which do not fall in interorder gaps .",
    "for example , only the na  i  d1 line ( 5896 ) is available , because the d2 line falls in an interorder gap .",
    "we adopt excitation potentials and @xmath13 values from @xcite .",
    "the balmer lines are not present in quiescent spectra of barnard s star , but are strongly in emission during the flare event .",
    "the balmer lines from h@xmath14 to h11 are shown in figure 1 , along with several other spectral regions of interest , for the first flare spectrum with the quiet spectrum subtracted .",
    "our spectra contain the balmer series up to h13 with the sole exception of h@xmath8 which lies in one of the red interorder gaps .",
    "the balmer lines are significantly broadened , as also noted during several other stellar and solar flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as described below , while the h and he lines are broadened , other chromospheric lines such as ca ii h&k are not broadened during the flare event .",
    "this is evidence for stark broadening .",
    "the measured balmer decrements ( relative to h@xmath15 ) are listed in table 3 for both f1 and f2 .",
    "we measured the ews relative to the normalized continuum .",
    "we then assigned a flux to the continuum by using a flux calibrated spectrum of ad leo .",
    "multipling the ew by this flux value gives our final balmer decrement .",
    "however , we note that the spectral type of ad leo is m3 whereas barnard s star is m4 . thus , our decrement measurements are only approximations considering the slightly mismatched continuum flux levels .",
    "as expected , the decrement decreases with increased balmer number ( table 3 ) and the magnitude of the half width reverses at h8 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the trend in the decrement appears to be slightly steeper than the flares on ad  leo ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite find that stark broadening causes @xmath13 times the fwhm broadening in h9 than in h@xmath15 .",
    "but this is not the case for our spectra , where the fwhm ( table 3 ) of h@xmath15 is 0.77  and in h9 is 0.65 .",
    "there are at least two possible reasons for this disagreement .",
    "first , there are nlte effects in the atmosphere which are not taken into account when applying a strict stark profile . at each wavelength",
    ", we see a combination of profiles from different layers which have different electron density and temperature .",
    "because the flux in the core gets trapped from the optically thick atmosphere and the flux in the wings is able to escape , the resulting profile is broader than predicted for the lower order balmer lines where the nlte effects are most important .",
    "second , our integration time is quite long so the impulsive phase broadening probably occurred only during a short part of the exposure .",
    "we can provide estimates of electron densities during the flare . according to @xcite ,",
    "our balmer decrement is shallow indicating that the electron densities ( n@xmath16 ) are @xmath010@xmath17  cm@xmath3 .",
    "an additional constaint on n@xmath16 can be placed using the inglis - teller relation for stark broadening .",
    "the highest resolved line is h13 and thus the upper limit on n@xmath16 is 1.5  x  10@xmath2  cm@xmath3 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , an order of magnitude below flares on ad leo @xcite and on yz cmi @xcite .",
    "a better approach is to carry out a detailed model of the line profiles using radiative hydrodynamical models . in figure 3",
    "we compare the observed balmer lines during the flare to simulated line profiles obtained from a radiative hydrodynamic model of flares on m dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "the simulated line profiles were calculated using the radiative transfer code multi @xcite with a 13 level plus continuum model hydrogen atom .",
    "temperature and electron density stratifications for a flaring m dwarf atmosphere were taken at numerous times during the f10 dynamical flare simulation reported in @xcite .",
    "line profiles were computed at each time and the results were co - added to produce an average line profile over the duration of the simulation .",
    "the f10 simulation corresponds to a moderately sized flare with an average electron density in the region of balmer formation of @xmath19  cm@xmath3 , and is therefore well suited for comparison to this flare .",
    "the predicted line profiles are significantly broader than observed for the low order balmer transitions .",
    "this is likely due to the assumption of complete redistribution in the dynamical computation .",
    "the large optical depth in the line cores of the lower order lines causes emission to be redistributed into the wings and results in broader line profiles .",
    "the higher order lines , where the effects of partial redistribution are less important , more closely match the observations . the principal broadening mechanism at these temperatures and densities in the simulation is found to be stark broadening ( see discussion in allred et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "asymmetry in the balmer lines has been reported for several stellar as well as solar flares , especially in the h@xmath8 and h@xmath14 lines ( e.g. fuhrmeister & schmitt 2004 , eason et al .",
    "1992 , johns - krull et al .",
    "1997 , schmieder et al .",
    "1987 , wlser 1987 , canfield et al .",
    "these are also seen in the uv lines in ad  leo @xcite .",
    "the asymmetric nature of chromospheric lines is attributed to mass motions in the chromosphere- the neupert effect ( evaporation ) or condensation .",
    "the neupert effect is seen in @xmath180% of large solar flares @xcite as well as in some stellar flares @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , by integrating over 30 minutes , sharp velocity features will likely have been washed out and thus we are unable to comment on mass motions , evaporation and velocity fields . as an example",
    ", figure 4 shows an expanded version of the h@xmath14 line in the f1 spectrum with the quiet spectrum subtracted .",
    "the dotted line is the blue half of the feature transposed onto the red side of the line .",
    "there is a very slight enhancement of the red wing with respect to the blue wing .",
    "this asymmetry is not seen in the instrumental profile as measured by the thar calibration lamp taken during the night .",
    "the lack of substantial asymmetry in our spectra is not surprising ; the asymmetric profile shape should be smeared out during the course of the integration .",
    "the slight asymmetry of h@xmath14 may be caused by condensation , but the data are not precise enough for any definitive conclusion .",
    "several broad he  i lines are in emission during the flare including pronounced emission in the 5876  line .",
    "@xcite note that the he i 5876  line is in emission only for very strong solar flares and is in absorption for medium and small flares . in our spectra",
    ", the emission in the he  i lines ( including 5876 ) is only present in f1 and is unmeasurable in f2 .",
    "the he  i lines are broad lines and the contamination of the narrow i@xmath10 lines in this region does not affect the detection of the broad he feature . because we see the he feature in f1 and not f2 , the flare was probably quite energetic but the impulsive heating was short lived ( @xmath20 30 min ) .",
    "the bottom right panel of figure 1 shows an example of the fine structure that is present in the he  i lines .",
    "additionally , garcia - alvarez et al . ( 2001 ) discuss the emission from a nearby mn  i line ( at 4030 ) possibly confusing the detection of the he  i  4026  line during times of increased activity .",
    "the he  i  4026  is clearly seen during our event ( figure 1 ) , despite line core emission in the nearby mn  i line at 4030  ( figure 5 ) . as discussed in @xmath113.2.3 , the mn  i 4030  emission core is shallow enough and our spectral resolution is sufficiently high to resolve these two lines .",
    "thus the detection of this line is not compromised by the mn  i line .",
    "the he  ii 4686  line is not commonly observed in uv  ceti - type stars but is present in our spectrum f1 . @xcite",
    "also detected it in spectra of a flare on ev lac and noted that it behaved in the same way as the he  ii 1640  line in ad leo @xcite .",
    "@xcite discuss the formation of this line in solar flares and conlcude that it is only formed in very deep regions of the chromosphere during the most intense flares .",
    "only one of the ca  ii  ir triplet lines ( 8662 ) is available due to interorder gaps .",
    "a strong fe  i line is blended with this line but , again our spectral resolution is sufficient so that it does not confuse the detection of filling - in of the ca  ii line .",
    "the fe  i line does not show enhancement of any kind during the flare . while the ca line is filled - in , there is no evidence for an emission core in the 8662  ca  ii line , though this is not too surprising as it is the weakest of the triplet @xcite .",
    "several strong lines of neutral metals are seen to have emission cores during the flare , while others only show a filling - in of the core .",
    "typically , the lines that have emission cores , as opposed to just filling - in , are very strong lines blueward of 4000 .",
    "we suggest that the filling - in effect is caused by the same heating as that which produces emission cores but is the limiting case in a @xmath21 weak line . as an example",
    ", figure 5 shows the pronounced emission in the cores of the 3944 & 3961  al  i lines . in quiescence",
    ", only the strong absorption line is present .",
    "the emission seen is only in f1 and by f2 the core has died down significantly , though it is still present .",
    "several of the blueward fe  i lines also show this central core emission .",
    "this is not often seen in dm flare spectra , but have been noted in various solar flares ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in selected cases of stellar flares @xcite .",
    "johns - krull et al .",
    "suggest that the optical depth in the flaring plasma is large enough to produce optically thin emission lines in the cores of strong photospheric lines .",
    "thus , for a weak line , it would appear as a filling - in , whereas in a resolved , strong line , it would appear as an emission core .    comparing this flare with that on ad leo , our spectra show photospheric line emission in all of the lines listed in table 2 of @xcite , excepting the unidentified lines at 3856.0 , 4078.7 and 4416.1  and the fe i line at 4358.51 .",
    "owing to the fact that our spectra are of higher spectral resolution and higher s / n , we see several lines not identified by hawley & pettersen . comparing our list of identifications with that of @xcite , who had similar s /",
    "n and resolving power , we note that redward of @xmath14900 , we only detect enhancement in about half of the neutral metals they list as enhanced during a 1993 solar flare , whereas we detect almost all of the lines listed in their table 7 blueward of 4900 .",
    "the reason for this is likely that the flare on barnard s star was more energetic ( and thus bluer ) than the solar flare or bluer relative to the stellar photosphere .",
    "it is important to understand the cause of the heating during a flare . during stellar flares , strong chromospheric lines such as mg  ii  h&k and ca  ii  h&k provide a significant source of radiation .",
    "this radiation could provide a source of optical pumping for other lines .",
    "the 4030  mn  i line has a central core emission similar to the al  i lines , while the other mn  i lines at 4033 and 4035  only show filling - in ( figure 5 ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that pumping by the mg  ii  k line could cause the mn  i 4030  line to appear in emission . because the other members of the mn  i triplet are also filled - in",
    ", optical pumping is unlikely to be the cause of this emission .",
    "additionally , @xcite and @xcite find that selective emission in the fe 43 multiplet ( 4005.23 , 4045.82 , 4063.57 , 4071.74 ) @xcite may be explained by optical pumping by the ca  ii  h line .",
    "we observe filling - in of 6 of the 7 multiplet 43 members .",
    "the 3969  line is completely blended with the h@xmath22 line and thus is unmeasurable .",
    "our observations do not support the optical pumping mechanism to produce the emission in these features .",
    "instead they are probably caused by the excitation / heating of the upper photosphere and provides further evidence for in situ heating of the chromosphere .",
    "because barnard s star is an old m dwarf , strong flares are probably uncommon . fortuitously ,",
    "a flare was observed during an unrelated science program with a high resolution spectrograph .",
    "the flare produced deep chromospheric heating resulting in strong blue continuum emission and significant stark broadening in the balmer emission lines .",
    "we determine a lower limit of 8000k for the blackbody temperature of the flaring region .",
    "in addition , the upper photosphere was heated sufficiently to cause emission in the cores of strong neutral metal lines , which has been previously observed during solar flares and less frequently in stellar flares .",
    "these data should provide good constaints on the heating of the lower atmosphere in detailed models of stellar flares .",
