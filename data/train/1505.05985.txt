    "phase transition in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is one of the central subjects in high energy nuclear physics both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "first principle lattice qcd ( lqcd ) calculations have shown that the transition from quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) to hadronic matter is of crossover type at physical quark masses @xcite , in which order parameters and thermodynamic quantities change smoothly as functions of temperature . at finite baryon density",
    ", one expects that the nature of the transition can change .",
    "unfortunately , little is known about the state of matter at high baryon density from lqcd calculations because of the difficulty in numerical simulation at finite baryon chemical potential @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "various approximation methods applied so far seem to work only @xmath4 or a small volume or heavy quark mass region .",
    "nevertheless , effective models which implement relevant symmetries in qcd and large @xmath5 studies have shown that rich phase structure exists in high density @xcite . in particular , if there is a first order phase transition at @xmath6 and large @xmath3 , there must be a critical point ( cp ) at which the first order phase transition line terminates and the transition becomes second order .",
    "existence of cp is supported by many chiral effective models @xcite , but its location depends on the detail of the models @xcite . stimulated by these theoretical results , the first beam energy scan program at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has been carried out in search for the cp @xcite . since lower colliding energies leaves the incident nucleons in the central region , one expects to explore higher baryon density region at lower energies .",
    "there are a number of observables which might have potential to indicate the transition from qgp to hadronic matter . among them",
    ", event - by - event fluctuations of conserved charges are intimately connected to critical behavior associated with the phase transition @xcite .",
    "measurements of the net - proton number fluctuations as a proxy of the net - baryon one @xcite and net electric charges have been presented for au+au collisions at various energies from @xmath7 gev to 200 gev @xcite .",
    "given the fact that multiplicity of different particle species are well described by statistical models @xcite , one may regard event - by - event fluctuations of conserved charges as those of the grand canonical ensembles at chemical freeze - out temperature @xmath8 and baryonic chemical potential @xmath3 . through systematic analyses of the location of @xmath9 corresponding to each colliding systems @xcite",
    ", one can map experimental measurements for property of the matter on @xmath10 plane .",
    "furthermore , recent lqcd results at physical quark masses indicate that the crossover region coincides with the chemical freeze - out at least for @xmath4 @xcite",
    ". one may look for remnant of the chiral criticality in the crossover region , originating from second order phase transition in the vanishing quark mass @xcite .",
    "property of the transition can be characterized by behavior of fluctuations of conserved charges as well as an order parameter and its fluctuations @xcite . in the case of the chiral phase transition in qcd , the chiral order parameter or quark - antiquark condensate @xmath11 couples to quarks carrying the baryon number and the electric charge .",
    "thus , the second order chiral phase transition in the chiral limit at finite temperature is characterized by not only divergent fluctuation of the order parameter but also higher order cumulants of the net baryon number and the net electric charge @xcite .",
    "the divergence of the conserved charge fluctuations is governed by the critical exponent of the specific heat @xmath12 which depends on the universality class qcd belongs to .",
    "although it is not completely determined yet @xcite , recent simulations @xcite indicate @xmath13 in the three dimensions , as conjectured by pisarski and wilczek @xcite . in this case",
    ", the first divergent cumulant appears at the sixth order . at finite but small quark masses ,",
    "the divergence is replaced by sign change , owing to the property of the universal @xmath13 scaling function @xcite . at nonzero",
    "net baryon number density , the divergence at @xmath14-th order cumulants in the chiral limit appears at @xmath15-th order one .",
    "the tricritical point in the chiral limit becomes the cp , where the second order cumulants diverge",
    ". the chemical freeze - out line may locate at lower temperature than the chiral phase boundary @xcite such that measured fluctuations might not reflect those at the phase transition @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of the cp is accompanied by anomalous behavior of the cumulants such as negative third and fourth order cumulants around the cp @xcite and may lead to non - monotonic behavior of the higher order cumulants as functions of @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , the measured net - proton number cumulants in @xcite seems to follow this expectation , although still inconclusive due to uncertainty .",
    "the measurement of the cumulants is based on event - by - event multiplicity distribution .",
    "once the fluctuations are regarded as those of the grand canonical ensemble , the multiplicity distribution can be identified with unnormalized probability distribution .    while the cumulants are expressed by central moments of the probability distribution , it is convenient for theoretical studies to compute them by differentiating the thermodynamic pressure with respect to chemical potentials .",
    "recently , one of the authors ( k.m . ) investigated the probability distribution of the net baryon number in models with phase transitions @xcite .",
    "it turns out that sufficient information on the tail in the probability distribution is responsible for the critical behavior of the higher order cumulants and that the remnant of the @xmath13 criticality can be characterized by narrower tail than the corresponding reference distribution . in the probability distribution ,",
    "such information on the phase transition is encoded in the @xmath17 dependence of the canonical partition function @xmath0",
    ".    since the grand partition function is more straightforward in relativistic quantum field theories where the number of particles are not definite , computations of the canonical partition function are not generally easy . in ref .",
    "@xcite , hasenfratz and toussaint proposed that the canonical partition function , @xmath0 , is calculated through the fourier transformation of the grand canonical partition function,@xmath18 , evaluated at pure imaginary @xmath3 . the difficulty associated with the complex fermion determinant is replaced by the highly oscillating integral which requires extraordinary numerical precision @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the probability distribution gives further insights into property of the system including phase transitions .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , one of the authors ( a.n . ) pointed out that one can extract the fugacity parameter @xmath19 at the chemical freeze - out and construct @xmath0 for the net baryon number without any assumption on the property of equilibrium @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , once @xmath0 is known , one can obtain the grand partition function @xmath18 as a series of fugacity .",
    "this enables us to apply yang - lee theory for the phase transition @xcite(for recent reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , in which zeros of the partition function give information on the thermodynamic property of the system .",
    "the zeros of the partition function are distributed on a line in the complex plane of an external parameter and its density grows up with the system volume , then finally coalesce into the line in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this property leads us , in principle , to obtain the location and order of the phase transition from the distribution of the zeros . even in the absence of the phase transition , the zeros accumulated on the edge of the distribution exhibit singular behavior",
    "this singularity , known as yang - lee edge singularity @xcite , can be regarded as a cp in the complex plane and gives influence on the thermodynamics on the real axis @xcite .    in both experiments and the canonical approach in lqcd , @xmath0 at large @xmath17 requires such high statistics that obtained information is limited to some finite @xmath17",
    ", thus one has to truncate the fugacity polynomial there in reconstructing the grand partition function ( see @xcite for recent lqcd calculations ) .",
    "it is not a priori clear whether one can obtain the correct information on the phase transition from such a truncated partition function .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to clarify this point .",
    "we employ a solvable model for the chiral phase transition in qcd .",
    "we present the yang - lee zeros in a chiral random matrix model , both for the exact grand partition function and for the reconstructed one as a truncated fugacity series with the canonical partition function being the coefficients .",
    "we discuss effects of the truncation on the distribution of the yang - lee zeros and compare it with the spurious zeros of the skellam partition function , originated from the truncation .    in the next section",
    ", we briefly summarize the general relation among the probability distribution , partition functions , and yang - lee zeros .",

    "we investigate in detail the effects of the truncation on the distribution of the yang - lee zeros .",

    "thus it is slightly lower than the chiral crossover temperature for @xmath129 . ]",
    "hereafter we set @xmath166 .",
    "we confirmed the following results does not depend on the specific choice of @xmath81 .",
    "we plot only the first quadrant in complex @xmath3 plane according to the symmetry structure of the distribution .    the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyz_tr1 ] shows the case of @xmath167 , at which transition is of crossover type as seen in the branch point at @xmath168 . for @xmath169 ,",
    "the zeros are located on the stokes boundary ( dashed line ) .",
    "reducing @xmath2 by one , i.e. , removing @xmath170 from the series , one sees a drastic change in the distribution .",
    "the distribution of the zeros at large @xmath164 and @xmath171 splits into the two lines , but the rest of the zeros remains unchanged .",
    "further reduction of @xmath2 substantially modifies the distribution such that the splitting occurs closer to the edge closer to the real @xmath3 axis .",
    "nevertheless , up to @xmath172 , the edge of the distribution which is the closest yang - lee zero to the real @xmath3 axis remains the same . beyond @xmath173 ,",
    "the distribution no longer holds the information on the exact yang - lee zeros thus the apparent relation to the phase boundary is lost .    , but for @xmath174    the behavior with respect to changing @xmath2 does not depend on temperature or corresponding phase transition . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lyz_tr1 ] , we plot the result of the same analysis for @xmath175 where the branch point appears on the real axis , indicating the critical point . reflecting the location of the branch point ,",
    "the edge of the distribution also become closer to the real axis compared to the crossover case .",
    "the edge is stable against decreasing @xmath2 down to @xmath176 , then it starts to deviate slowly when decreased further .",
    "this is so also in the case of first order phase transition ( @xmath177 ) depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyz_tr_rm ] .",
    "the branch point is hidden in unphysical riemann sheets @xcite and the edge is very close to the real axis .",
    "we also note that there is always a zero at @xmath178 when @xmath2 is odd .",
    "these zeros look special since it corresponds to negative real axis in both complex @xmath34 and @xmath71 plane .",
    "however , this is a mathematical consequence because in this case the truncated partition function is an odd order polynomial , thus it has at least one real root . as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : lyz_tr1 ] and [ fig : lyz_tr_rm ] , it becomes the edge of one of the lines bifurcating from the exact yang - lee zeros .",
    "these results indicate the stability of the edge does not depend on the detail of the phase structure , although the location of the edge seems to be connected with the shape of the stokes boundary which is model dependent through the @xmath3 dependence of the partition function .",
    "in particular , the present results are obtained by employing the periodicity in the random matrix model which does not correctly take into account degrees of freedom with baryon charges @xcite .",
    "we note that this modification causes unphysical behavior in thermodynamics , such as negative @xmath0 at some small @xmath17 at low @xmath8 , which presumably reflect the unusual curvature of the phase boundary in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] .",
    "therefore , we note that the shape of the distribution itself might not be relevant for realistic situations .",
    "nevertheless , below we shall see that the stability of the edge is specific to the case with a phase transition .",
    "figure [ fig : lattice ] displays distribution of the yang - lee zeros above @xmath140 calculated in lattice qcd simulation via the canonical method @xcite . while calculations in the confinement phase is still numerically difficult thus we do not see clear indications of a phase transition at low @xmath8 , the roberge - weiss ( rw ) transition @xcite provides us a well - defined phase transition in high temperature quark - gluon plasma phase , though at imaginary chemical potential . in this figure ,",
    "the data are calculated on @xmath179 lattices and @xmath180 which corresponds to @xmath181 . a more detailed analysis in lattice qcd with different lattice setups",
    "can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . since quark mass is heavy , the calculation is not relevant for chiral phase transition .",
    "the rw transition is regarded as a transition from one @xmath141 sector to another one when single quarks can be excited owing to deconfinement and is known to exhibit a first order phase transition at @xmath182 . in terms of baryon chemical potential , the transition lines reduce to @xmath165 which is shown as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "a brief explanation of the roberge - weiss phase boundary can be found in appendix [ sec : app_b ] .",
    "since it is hard to compute @xmath183 near @xmath184 , the canonical approach in lattice qcd lacks large @xmath17 contribution when one constructs the truncated partition function .",
    "one sees that in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] the behavior of the distribution of the yang - lee zeros against changing @xmath2 is similar to that of the random matrix model , despite the completely different origin of the phase transition .",

    "@xcite is also due to the truncation effect . indeed ,",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath2 dependence of the yang - lee zero shown in ref .",
    "@xcite agrees with the truncation effects discussed here .",
    "we expect that the bifurcation of the zero starts at large @xmath164 by improving the fugacity expansion , but one needs to take @xmath185 to completely produce the yang - lee zero along the transition line . in the rw transition",
    "where the transition point at @xmath186 , the edge of the distribution is the closest zero to the imaginary axis .",
    "one sees that this point is also stable against changing @xmath2 .",
    "this fact suggests that the stability of the edge is not specific to the random matrix model or chiral phase transition but might be a general property of the distribution when partition function is truncated .",
    "finally we examine a model without phase transition in order to check whether the stability of the edge is specific to phase transition or not .",
    "we employ the skellam distribution @xcite of which probability distribution of the net baryon number @xmath17 is given by @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 denote the thermal averages of the numbers of baryons and anti - baryons , respectively .",
    "the mean @xmath26 and variance @xmath190 of the distribution are given by @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath193 , the distribution becomes symmetric and the argument of the modified bessel function @xmath194 is reduced to @xmath195 .",

    "obviously the grand partition function does not have any roots thus no phase transition exists .",
    "when one constructs the truncated grand partition function from the canonical partition function , however , there exist complex roots .",
    "consequently , one might see these spurious zeros even if the system does not have any phase transition , when one constructs the partition function through the fugacity expansion .    here",
    "we investigate such spurious zeros from the skellam partition function such that it has the same variance with the random matrix model at @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath129 of which distribution of the yang - lee zeros is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyz_tr1 ] .",
    "since the information on the phase transition is encoded in the tail of the probability distribution @xmath20 , the skellam distribution with the same variance serves a useful reference distribution @xcite .",
    "the probability distribution of the random matrix model and corresponding skellam distribution are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : skellam]-left .",
    "both distributions almost agree for small @xmath17 , according to the same @xmath190 , but the deviation appears in the tail of the distribution with tiny probability .",
    "figure [ fig : skellam]-right shows the distribution of zeros of the truncated partition function for the skellam distribution with @xmath197 . except for a splitting of the distribution for @xmath198 which is similar to those in the random matrix model , the distributions consist almost parallel lines moving to large real @xmath3 direction as @xmath199 increases .",
    "this behavior reflects the fact that all the zeros go away to infinity as @xmath200 since the exact grand partition function does not have roots .",
    "remarkably , the edges of the distributions also move together with the rest of zeros , in contrast to the random matrix model and lattice qcd . furthermore",
    ", one notes that the distributions for @xmath201 in the random matrix model , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyz_tr1 ] , resemble those from the skellam distribution .",
    "this observation indicates that the stability of the edge against @xmath2 is a consequence of the existence of phase transition and information on the phase transition is lost for too small @xmath2 .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that the edge of the distribution of the yang - lee zeros remains unchanged when the tail part of the canonical partition function is missing . in practice",
    ", this property gives implications for necessary statistics in heavy ion studies of the net - baryon number fluctuations and in lattice qcd calculations .",

    "this observation indicates that those higher order terms may have limited influences in search for the location of the phase boundary in lattice qcd calculations and heavy ion experiments .",
    "although the distribution of zeros exist in systems without phase transition , due to the truncation , the zeros closest to the real @xmath3 axis are stable against truncation if the system has a phase transition or crossover .",
