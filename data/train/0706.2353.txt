    "the `` missing hole '' of the donut , i.e. the absence of daughter cells with the same min densities as the parent cell , arises from the phase - difference between the leading mind cap - forming and lagging mine ring - forming oscillations .",

    "we believe that this is a fundamental aspect of end - to - end min oscillation : when the mind cap is at one pole , the distal pole is stable .",
    "this should be a generic feature of all min oscillation models .",
    "the robustness of the best percentage of oscillating daughters under changes in concentration , parameter variation , heterogeneous perturbations , model variation , dimensionality , and stochastic effects support this conclusion .",
    "how might _ e. coli _ achieve its ( observed ) negligible level of minicelling ?",
    "we see four basic possibilities .",
    "as suggested by tostevin and howard @xcite , the non - oscillating daughters could be rescued by rapid regeneration of min concentration .",
    "this would require min synthesis to be regulated in a cell - cycle dependent manner .",
    "because the average concentration of the two daughter cells equals their parent cell , rapid synthesis leading to recovery in one daughter cell would lead to a spike in min concentration right after septation .",
    "however , there is no evidence of such fine - tuned regulatory control , or cell - cycle dependence , of min concentration @xcite .",
    "moreover , lack of adequate partitioning would give rise to substantial asymmetry of min proteins in the two daughter cells that should be apparent in experimental studies  especially with the simple inducible promoters ( not actively regulated ) typically used in min - gfp fusion studies @xcite .",
    "in our simulations we found that the fraction of the parent mind and mine in daughter cells can be as low @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively .",
    "the lack of any reports of such large visible asymmetries argues against rapid min regeneration .",
    "the partitioning problem can be avoided if the min oscillations `` double - up '' before septation , leading to two symmetric oscillations in the two halves of the parent cell .",
    "a closing septum would then maintain symmetric min distributions in the daughter cells .",
    "indeed , we were hoping to promote this effect with the introduction of cardiolipin patches at poles and septum  without success .",
    "while there has been one experimental report of a doubling of oscillation for deeply constricted cells @xcite , this must be approached with caution due to the difficulty of distinguishing partial from full septation .",
    "we never found any evidence for doubling up of oscillations in our simulations . in all cases , we found that oscillations continue until just before the end of septation .",
    "indeed , the min oscillation wavelength of @xmath76 seen in filamentous cells @xcite would suggest that it is difficult to spontaneously generate @xmath77 oscillations while significant connection between the two ends of the parent cell remains .",
    "distortion and/or disruption of the min oscillation by the growing septum before septal closure might also lead to symmetric partitioning of min between the daughter cells .",
    "we do find that mind binding to the sides of the growing septum improves partitioning .",
    "this was evident by comparing the partitioning for a finite septation time ( @xmath37 seconds ) with instantaneous septation ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "in the latter case , no mind can accumulate on the septum before the daughter cells are separated .",
    "this resulted in highly skewed min distributions between the two daughter cells ( results not shown ) .",
    "however , significant partitioning errors still occur with gradual septal growth .",
    "moreover , no significant improvement in partitioning was observed when the mind binding was enhanced at the midcell .",
    "we also found that min oscillation was often temporarily disrupted in one daughter cell despite acceptable partitioning for oscillation in both daughters . the time required for recovery of steady oscillations was sometimes as large as 15 minutes .",
    "this is much larger than the dynamical time - scale of ftsz rings @xcite , though , as shown by tostevin and howard @xcite , stochastic effects may eliminate or significantly decrease the regeneration time of oscillations .",
    "disruption of the min oscillation in both daughter cells by the late stages of septation may therefore be a viable partitioning mechanism _ in vivo _ especially if the resulting uniform distribution of min is sufficient to block septation @xcite in the face of fast ftsz dynamics @xcite while the min oscillation is being regenerated .",

    "the challenge lies in understanding how min oscillations can persist or be regenerated in both daughter cells after septation , in the face of partitioning errors due to the end - to - end oscillation of the min proteins . without one or more of the additional mechanisms discussed above , we expect significant partitioning errors , leading to non - oscillating daughters , in all min models .",
