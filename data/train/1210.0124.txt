    "for neumann boundary conditions , solutions exist under additional assumptions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , and are unique up to additive constants ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are various analytical and numerical methods to find solutions of the boundary value problems for poisson and navier equations .",
    "most of the numerical methods developed for these problems are based on finite difference approximations @xcite , finite element analysis @xcite and fourier transform @xcite.the finite element method has become a dominant approach to solving the elasticity problems , with the exception of the microelasticity analysis for strain interactions in microstructures , where the fourier transform is still used intensively .",
    "all major numerical techniques are still used for the electrostatic ( or magnetostatic ) and electromagnetic problems .      in the present paper",
    "we consider the following inverse electrostatic and elasticity problems : the charge distributions or the internal body forces are not known , and the states of the system , i.e. , the functions @xmath33 or @xmath17 , should be determined from the boundary conditions  or , respectively , .",
    "note that it is assumed that both dirichlet and neumann data are obtained from the boundary measurements .",
    "such problems have attracted much interest in the recent years among physicists and engineers ( see section [ sec : disc ] and references therein ) .",
    "the problems described above can be viewed as examples of inverse problems of potential theory @xcite .",
    "these problems are different from the caldern s inverse conductivity and elasticity problems , for which the coefficients of the left  hand sides of the equations , rather than",
    "the right  hand sides , are unknown and have to be determined from the boundary data ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the inverse electrostatic problem formulated above is closely related to the inverse gravimetry problem that has important applications to geophysics and has been intensively studied for many years ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) . in the present subsection",
    "we collect some general results on uniqueness of solutions of inverse problems for poisson and navier equations . essentially , they are well - known ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "we present their proofs in subsection [ sec : harm ] for the sake of completeness .",
    "let , as before , @xmath34 be a euclidean domain with piecewise smooth boundary @xmath8 .",
    "consider the following overdetermined boundary value problem for the poisson equation : @xmath35 @xmath36 let @xmath37 be the space of _ harmonic functions _ on @xmath0 .",

    ", the right  hand side of equation should be understood as the mass density and the function @xmath43 as the gravitational potential .",
    "therefore , theorem  [ main ] can be reformulated as follows : the inverse gravimetry problem possesses a uniqueness property for mass distributions given by checkered functions . to our knowledge , distributions of this type have not been previously studied for the inverse gravimetry problem .",

    "the interest in the inverse problems considered in the present paper arises from a number of practical applications .",
    "for example , in microelectronics , the observation of the internal voltage distribution in a device can be very important for the testing and diagnostic of devices under development @xcite .",
    "the inverse elasticity problem naturally appears in the analysis of _ residual stresses _ @xcite .",
    "these stresses are produced in the materials as a result of non - uniform deformation during forming , heat treatment and welding processes .",
    "the effect of a residual stress field is similar to the effect of an internal force distribution , and one can be converted into the other .",
    "modern experimental methods , such as scanning probe microscopy @xcite , can be used to obtain data on the electric potential and electric field at the surfaces of the component @xcite .",
    "digital image correlation @xcite can be applied to study the displacement distribution .",
    "these methods allow to obtain the cauchy boundary conditions for electrostatic or elastic problems corresponding to real objects or components with high accuracy and fine resolution .",
    "the important question is to which extent such information can be used to find the charge ( and the potential ) or the internal force distributions inside the body , and whether the corresponding inverse problems have unique solutions . for simple distributions of internal charges or residual",
    "stresses the inverse problems can be solved easily ( for example , for a 2-d distribution of charges in a thin layer or 1-d distribution of residual stresses with a single significant stress component ) .",
    "however , for general charge and internal stress distributions the issue becomes quite difficult .",
    "while theorems [ main ] and [ main2 ] give a complete mathematical solution of the inverse electrostatics and elasticity problems for checkered distributions , from the viewpoint of practical applications these results are far from satisfactory , see section [ sec : chal ]",
    ".      one may ask whether the analogues of theorems [ main ] and [ main2 ] hold for other , non - checkered , electric charge and internal stress distributions .",

    "[ ups ] the map @xmath133 is injective .",
    "moreover , there exists a constructive procedure to recover @xmath130 from the function @xmath134 .    to prove proposition [ ups ] we need an auxiliary lemma below .",

    "we also call a node @xmath139 _ artificial _ if there exists a neighborhood of @xmath139 in which @xmath33 does not change its value across a plane passing through @xmath139 and parallel to one of the coordinate planes .",
    "it is easy to check that all artificial nodes are not interesting ( and , therefore , artificial nodes can not be determined from @xmath120 ) , but the converse is not necessarily true .",

    "let @xmath33 be a restriction to @xmath0 of a function which is identically equal to @xmath124 in the positive and the negative octants , and vanishes elsewhere .",
    "then @xmath139 is not an artificial node , but at the same time @xmath143 by and , hence , @xmath139 is not interesting .",
    "one could view the difference between artificial and non - artificial nodes as follows .",
    "let us colour @xmath0 in such a way that points @xmath144 have the same colour if and only if @xmath145 .",
    "then @xmath0 can be represented as a disjoint union of sets @xmath146 , such that all points in @xmath147,@xmath148 , have the same colour , and the points in @xmath149 and @xmath150 , @xmath151 have different colours .",
    "each @xmath147 is a not necessarily connected union of boxes .",
    "a node is not artificial if it is a vertex of one of the sets @xmath147 , and artificial otherwise .",
    "let @xmath152 be the set of interesting nodes .",
    "we say that a point @xmath136 is a _ marked node _ if @xmath153 for some @xmath154 .",
    "note that the properties of being a marked node or an interesting node do not depend on the choice of the representation of @xmath33 .",
    "[ marked ] the set of all marked nodes contains the set of all non - artificial nodes .    without loss of generality ,",
    "suppose that the node @xmath155 is not marked .",
    "this means that among interesting nodes there are either no points with @xmath156 , or with @xmath157 , or with @xmath158 . in each case , the corresponding plane ( say , @xmath156 ) does not contain interesting nodes .",
    "let us show that the function @xmath33 does not change its value across this plane .",
    "this would mean that all nodes contained in this plane are artificial , including @xmath155 .",
    "consider a decomposition of @xmath0 into boxes , such that the set of all their vertices coincides with the set of all nodes of @xmath33 ( this could be achieved by constructing planes through each node parallel to the coordinate planes ) .",
    "it follows from the definition of a node that @xmath33 is constant on each of these boxes .",
    "take one of the corner nodes belonging to the plane @xmath156 ( i.e. a node lying on one of the edges of @xmath0 ) . at each such node at most two boxes meet .",
    "therefore , if this node is not interesting , the values of @xmath33 at the boxes adjacent to it are equal and hence the node is artificial . note that by formula , the total contribution of these two boxes to the value of @xmath120 at any other node lying on the plane @xmath156 is zero .",
    "let us throw away these two boxes and pick another node where at most two of the remaining boxes meet .",

    "we repeat the procedure until all boxes adjacent to the plane @xmath156 are thrown away . at each step",
    "we get artificial nodes only .",
    "this completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "let us now prove proposition [ ups ] .",
    "the proof is based on a similar inductive argument as above .",
    "we start at a corner box , on which formula allows us to reconstruct in an unambiguous way the value of @xmath33 from the value of @xmath120 on the corresponding corner vertex .",
    "we remove that box , move to an adjacent one and repeat the procedure .",
    "a similar approach will be used again in the proof of proposition [ prop3 ] .    as follows from lemma",
    "[ marked ] , knowing @xmath159 allows us to construct a decomposition of @xmath0 into boxes , whose vertices include all non - artificial nodes . we know the values of @xmath120 at each vertex of these boxes .",
    "let us now reconstruct the value of @xmath33 at each of the boxes using the following inductive procedure . start with a vertex that is also a vertex of @xmath0 , and take the box that contains it ( there is a unique box with this property ) .",
    "since there are no other boxes containing this vertex , by , the value of @xmath120 at this vertex determines the value of @xmath33 at the box .",
    "we subtract the contribution of this box to @xmath120 , throw away this box and take one of the new corner vertices , at which at most two of the remaining boxes meet . at each step of this procedure",
    "we determine the value of @xmath33 on the corner box , and reduce the number of boxes by one .",
    "since the number of boxes is finite , eventually we will determine the value of @xmath33 on each box .",

    "we have tested the developed algorithm for the solution of the inverse electrostatic problem on a rectangle @xmath239 with boundary @xmath8 , containing two rectangular charged areas ( fig .",
    "the boundary conditions corresponding to this problem were obtained using the green function method implemented numerically .",
    "in other words , we computed a solution @xmath43 of the equation @xmath45 on the whole plane using green s function , and calculated numerically its values as well as the values of its normal derivative on @xmath8 .",
    "here @xmath33 is the characteristic function of the total charged area .     of the domain @xmath0.,width=226 ]",
    "it was found that if @xmath195 is calculated directly using the integration over @xmath0 , then the procedure based on and produces the convex hull of the charged areas with high accuracy .",
    "however , when @xmath195 is calculated using the integration over the boundary , the algorithm based on produces the convex hull occupying the whole @xmath0 .",
    "such a drastic difference is the result of small numerical errors in the boundary conditions determined by the numerical solution of the direct problem , and also in the numerical integration over the boundary .",
    "strong sensitivity to numerical errors arises from a specific nature of exponential functions .",
    "when @xmath20 is large , these functions are rapidly increasing in one direction and rapidly oscillating in the orthogonal direction . as a result , small errors in boundary conditions are multiplied by large factors and the convex hull estimate based on and becomes distorted . for small values of @xmath20 , the value of @xmath240 obtained using the integration over @xmath0",
    "is close to the one obtained using the integration over @xmath8 .",
    "however , as @xmath20 increases these two values diverge .    in order to verify the validity of the computational model",
    ", calculations were performed for the constant charge density : @xmath241 on @xmath0 . in this case , the precise value of @xmath242 can be computed analytically . for all values of @xmath20 , the analytical equations produced the same @xmath240 values , no matter if the integration was performed over @xmath0 or its boundary @xmath8 .",
    "however , in the numerical analysis of this problem , the area and boundary integration were producing close values for small values of @xmath20 and were diverging for large @xmath20 .    in practical problems based on experimental data ,",
    "boundary conditions are always obtained with some errors .",
    "therefore , as the above analysis show , in order to produce an algorithm for the solution of the inverse electrostatics problem that is numerically implementable , one needs to modify our approach .",
    "one possibility would be to find a set of harmonic functions exhibiting good behavior from the numerical viewpoint , which could replace the exponentials in the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "the goal of this subsection is to prove theorems [ harm ] and [ harm2 ] .",
    "let us start with theorem [ harm ] . to prove necessity , suppose that @xmath43 is a solution of problem and let @xmath243 .",
    "then @xmath244 note that the boundary terms in the integration by parts disappear since @xmath245 .    to prove sufficiency , denote by @xmath246 the green s function of the dirichlet boundary value problem in @xmath0 : @xmath247 and by @xmath248 the green s function for the corresponding neumann boundary value problem : @xmath249 note that the integral over @xmath0 of the right  hand side of the equation above is zero , which is necessary for the existence of a solution of the neumann problem with zero boundary conditions .",
    "it follows from the definitions of @xmath250 and @xmath251 that @xmath252 is a harmonic function of @xmath253 .",
    "therefore , the assumption @xmath254 implies @xmath255 for all @xmath256 . note that the term @xmath257 is constant and hence of no importance for the neumann boundary value problem .",
    "let us also remark that @xmath258 since @xmath40 .",
    "it is easy to check that , by the properties of @xmath250 and @xmath251 , the function @xmath43 constructed above is a solution of problem .",
    "this completes the proof of proposition [ harm ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ harm2 ] is completely analogous .",
    "we note that the existence of green s functions for the navier equation with either dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions is well - known   see , for instance @xcite .",
    "_ proof of ( i ) .",
    "_ let @xmath259 be three spherical layers centered at the origin such that @xmath260 and @xmath261 . consider the following linear combination of characteristic functions of the sets @xmath262 and @xmath263 : @xmath264 by the mean value theorem for harmonic functions we immediately have @xmath265 , and this completes the proof of part ( i ) of the proposition .",
    "_ proof of ( ii ) _ in order to prove the second part of the proposition we note that a function @xmath67 lying in the kernel of the navier operator @xmath266 is _",
    "biharmonic_. indeed , let @xmath267 .",
    "taking the divergence on both sides we get @xmath268 .",
    "here we took into account that @xmath269 and that the laplacian commutes with the divergence . at the same time , applying the laplacian to @xmath270 we get @xmath271 but since @xmath268 , the second term vanishes , because @xmath272 hence , @xmath273 and @xmath67 is biharmonic .",
    "it is well - known that a real valued biharmonic function @xmath274 satisfies the following mean - value property ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath275 where @xmath276 is a ball of radius @xmath277 centered at @xmath278 and @xmath279 is the volume of the unit ball in @xmath280 .",
    "consider now a ball @xmath281 centered at the origin .",
    "let us represent it as a union of three sets @xmath282 , @xmath283 .",
    "let @xmath284 be a piecewise constant vector - valued function taking the values @xmath285 and @xmath286 on @xmath287 and @xmath288 ) , respectively , and the value one on @xmath289 . clearly , @xmath290 for all @xmath291 .",
    "let us show that for any triple @xmath292 there exists a choice of parameters @xmath293 such that @xmath294 .",
    "it can be deduced from the mean - value formula , that the inclusion @xmath294 holds if the following system of equations is satisfied : @xmath295 one may check that the determinant of this system does not vanish for @xmath283 . indeed , if @xmath296 , the only positive roots of the determinant considered as a polynomial in @xmath297 are @xmath298 and @xmath299 ( there are no other positive roots because , as can be easily verified , the derivative with respect to @xmath297 has only one positive root ) .",
    "hence , there always exists a unique solution @xmath300 of the system above , and the corresponding function @xmath294 .",
    "the proof of part ( i ) of theorem [ spherical ] shows that the intersection @xmath301 is in fact quite large .",
    "indeed , it is easy to show that for any partition of @xmath109 into @xmath302 concentric spherical layers , there exists a @xmath303dimensional linear subspace of functions in @xmath304 .",
    "the proof of part ( ii ) goes through without changes if instead of a ball @xmath305 one takes a spherical layer @xmath306 .",
    "it follows from the proof that for any partition of @xmath109 into @xmath302 concentric spherical layers , there exists a @xmath307dimensional linear space of functions in @xmath308 .",
