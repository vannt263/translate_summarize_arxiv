    "with the advent of photospheric magnetographs / magnetometers in the sixties , it has soon been realised that the coronal magnetic field can be derived by assuming an equilibrium state .",
    "the main forces excerted on the coronal plasma are the plasma pressure , the gravitational force , and the magnetic or lorentz forces .",
    "this gives the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the plasma pressure and density , @xmath3 is the gravity , @xmath4 is the electric current density , and @xmath5 is the magnetic field .",
    "this equation is a partial different equation , which can be solved by imposing a set of boundary conditions in a finite or semi - finite domain of computation .",
    "in addition , maxwell s equation given the divergence - freeness of the magnetic field has also to be considered .",
    "the technique is the so - called magnetic field extrapolation / reconstruction ( nowadays both words are used without distinction ) .",
    "two problems have to be distinguished : ( i ) to numerically solve the system of equations , ( ii ) to incorporate solar data into the numerical codes .",
    "both problems need a careful treatment as the convergence of a well - established numerical code does not imply the convergence of the same code with a specific dataset . in this review",
    ", i will address the magnetic field extrapolations performed using photospheric / chromospheric magnetograms as boundary conditions .",
    "this indeed assumes that the algorithms to extrapolate the magnetic field are behaving well with data .",
    "the magnetograms used as boundary conditions are recorded by ground - based or space - born instruments . for this review ,",
    "the pros and cons of different instruments are not taken into account and only the physics problems and results addressed in the cited papers are considered .",
    "the aim of this review is to show that the magnetic field extrapolation techniques have been used to tackle successfully a broad range of solar physics issues .",
    "recently , two reviews have been published with a different focus to this paper : ( i ) @xcite focused their discussion on the nonlinear force - free field methods with a short section on the comparison with the structures of the solar corona , ( ii ) @xcite describe the progress in the modelling of global photospheric and coronal magnetic fields which includes extrapolation techniques as well as flux transport models which are not discussed here .",
    "the review is organised as follows .",
    "i first give a brief review of the different models used to reconstruct the solar atmospheric magnetic field ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) . in section  [ sec :",
    "phys ] , the important quantities that can be derived from a magnetic field configuration are listed .",
    "thus , the results obtained from magnetic field extrapolations are discussed for the quiet sun ( see section  [ sec : qs ] ) , and for active regions ( see section  [ sec : ar ] ) . to conclude ( see section  [ sec : disc ] ) , i discuss the issues which are still to be resolved , and the futher developments that i envision for the magnetic field extrapolation techniques .",
    "magnetic field extrapolation techniques aim at solving a system of differential equations with the appropriate set of boundary conditions .",
    "an extrapolation scheme is judged on the well - posedness of the problem , that is to say to find the right combination of boundary conditions to solve a particular physical problem .",
    "i will thus distinguish between ( i ) the goodness of the numerical scheme which is usually tested with analytical and/or semi - analytical solutions , and ( ii ) the goodness of the extrapolation which includes the effects of the boundary conditions as provided by observations .",
    "most of the schemes described below are good numerical schemes ; however , their behaviour when extrapolating solar data can be significantly different , or has not yet been tested .",
    "the potential field is the solution of laplace s equation : @xmath6 the solutions of this equation are well - known as harmonic functions in different geometries .",
    "the potential field is relatively easy to compute as it only requires the knowledge of the normal component of the magnetic field on the boundaries of the domain .",
    "for instance , to compute the potential field in a cartesian box only the normal / vertical component is needed on the bottom boundary as often provided by line - of - sight magnetic field measurements , whilst closed / open boundary can be imposed on the side and top boundaries .",
    "the first potential field extrapolation techniques have been in the early 60s with the development of photospheric magnetographs @xcite .",
    "several methods have been compared by @xcite showing that the connectivity and geometry of field lines can be different fom one model to the other .",
    "we usually distinguish between potential field and force - free field extrapolations even if the potential field is a particular case of force - free field , and thus has similar properties of existence and stability @xcite .",
    "the force - free fields assume implicitely that the solar atmospheric plasma is a low @xmath7 plasma .",
    "the linear force - free ( lff ) field is described by the following equation : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a scalar called the force - free parameter .",
    "the boundary conditions are given by the normal component of the magnetic field on the boundaries of the computational box , to which a guess for the @xmath9-value is added .",
    "the numerical methods to solve this linear problem include vertical integration , green s functions , fourier transforms , spherical harmonics , and boundary integrals in either cartesian or spherical coordinates (; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "very few studies of the behaviour of lff field algorithms have been performed @xcite .    as it is obvious from photospheric vector magnetic field observations that a single value of @xmath9 can not describe the coronal magnetic field @xcite ,",
    "several methods have been attempted to derive the geometry of a single coronal loop using the @xmath9-value that will best fit the observed loop @xcite . in other words",
    ", this corresponds to a piecewise lff field for a discrete ( usually small ) number of loops .",
    "the nonlinear force - free ( nlff ) field satisfies the following equation : @xmath10 where @xmath9 is the force - free function depending on the position @xmath11 . taking the divergence of the above equation",
    ", we obtain that @xmath12 implying that @xmath9 is constant along a given magnetic field line .",
    "this fact is reinforced in the corona as the conduction along the magnetic field dominates ( the conduction accross field lines is negligible ) .",
    "the nlff methods have been summarised by @xcite .",
    "the main methods to extrapolate the magnetic field into the corona as a nlff field are :    * the method consists in propagating the boundary conditions into the corona from the bottom boundary , layer by layer (; , , ; ; ; , @xcite ) .",
    "* based on the low plasma-@xmath7 mhd equations , an initial configuration including electric currents is relaxed to a nonlinear force - free state owing to resistivity , also know as stress - and - relax models . *",
    "the basic principle is to minimise a functional containing the force - free constraint as well as the solenoidal constraint to relax an initial configuration towards a nonlinear force - free state (; ; , @xcite , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ) . in the recent years",
    ", the optimization scheme has been developed to include more constraints and thus to obtain an equilibrium closer to a force - free field . * the nonlinear force - free equation being a system of partial differential equations of mixed type , the method described by @xcite consists in separating the elliptic part ( force - free equation ) and the hyperbolic part ( gradient of @xmath9 ) of the system , each system being then linear and easier to solve .",
    "rubin method requires as boundary conditions the vertical / radial component of the magnetic field on each boundary , as well as the distribution of @xmath9 in a chosen polarity .",
    "this ensures that the extrapolation method is a mathematically well - posed problem in hadamard sense .",
    "* the nonlinear force - free model can be describe as an exterior problem and a boundary integral equation written in which the magnetic field component within a volume can be determined by the magnetic field components on the boundary .",
    "the formulation of the boundary integrals can be found by @xcite and recently applied to solar cases (; , @xcite ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "* the theory of force - free electrodynamics is applied to the modelling of coronal magnetic fields which has been applied successfully to pulsar magnetospheres @xcite .    with the development of different numerical techniques , testing and comparing different algorithms",
    "has been proven to be needed .",
    "the main efforts have been done since 2004 by the international group on nonlinear force - free modelling ( , @xcite ; ; ) .",
    "one aim of this series of papers has been to show that modellers need to be careful when injecting the boundary conditions into the numerical codes : the boundary conditions have to be consistent with the assumption of the model and the set - up of the numerical code .",
    "for instance , in , it has been shown that by selecting carefully the photospheric magnetic field , the coronal magnetic field structure in the core of the reconstructed active region was similar for all nlff methods .",
    "several other papers have addressed quantitative differences between several algorithms .",
    "the next step after the force - free field extrapolation is to solve the magnetohydrostatic ( mhs ) equilibrium equation , which includes the plasma pressure force and the gravitational force in addition to the magnetic forces .",
    "an algorithm has been developed by @xcite as a well - posed problem .",
    "this algorithm has been recently implemented by @xcite neglecting the gravity ( see also @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the optimization scheme has also been adapted to solve the magnetohydrostatic equation .",
    "the models usually require to define a realistic atmosphere from the photosphere to the corona . as a first order assumption ( neglecting the feedback between the magnetic field and plasma properties )",
    ", @xcite derived the global properties of alfvn speed , plasma @xmath7-values and reconnection rate in the corona by assuming a nonlinear force - free equilibrium for the magnetic field and a hydrostatic equilibrium for the plasma .",
    "a minimum dissipation rate method has been adapted to include photospheric measurements ( , @xcite ; ; , @xcite ) .",
    "the method describes a general or non - force - free magnetic field by a superimposition of one potential field and two linear force - free fields .",
    "@xcite have developed a non - force - free model , the so - called stretched magnetic field , which combined photospheric magnetograms and the structures of coronal loops .",
    "i will also mention several other analytical / numerical methods that have been used to access the structure of the three - dimensional coronal magnetic field , but which can not be classified as extrapolation techniques as such .",
    "this first method to have produced significant results is the point - charge method .",
    "a magnetogram is decomposed in a discrete number of polarities , which are reduced to points associated with the magnetic flux of the polarity ( zero magnetic field outside the point charges ) .",
    "the magnetic field is thus given by an analytical solution .",
    "for instance , the method has been developed and used for theorising the topology of magnetic field in different geometries (; ; ; ; , @xcite ; ; ; ) .",
    "the point - charge method has also been used to fit the observed 3d coronal loops following a nonlinear force - free assumption ( , @xcite , @xcite ; ) . another successful model to determine the properties of the coronal magnetic field is the flux rope insertion model developed by @xcite .",
    "starting from an equilibrium state ( often a potential field ) , a flux rope or twisted flux tube is inserted within the magnetic configuration by modifying the boundary conditions and by matching the observed x - ray sigmoid or h@xmath9 filament ( see _ e.g. _ , ) .      in order to solve a system of differential equations ,",
    "it is important to define the correct boundary conditions that will lead to a mathematically well - posed problem ( or not ) in the hadamard sense .    for the potential field ,",
    "only the normal component of the magnetic field on the boundaries of the computational box is needed .    for the linear force - free field ,",
    "the normal component is required , to which a guess for the value of @xmath9 in the computational volume will be added .    for the nonlinear force - free field",
    ", the normal component of the magnetic field as well as the distribution of @xmath9 has to be imposed . according to @xcite , imposing the distribution of @xmath9 in",
    "one chosen polarity as the boundary condition will lead to a mathematically well - posed problem .",
    "it is important to notice here that in order to compute the distribution of @xmath9 from vector magnetograms , the following formula is used ( in cartesian coordinates with @xmath13 on the photospheric surface ) : @xmath14 this equation is considered owing to the measurement of the magnetic field vector on the @xmath15-plane , implying that no derivatives with respect to @xmath16 can be computed .",
    "a further discussion on the implication of this formula will be done in section  [ sec : cbound ] .",
    "for the minimum dissipation model , the vector magnetic field components on one or two different atmospheric layers are needed .    for the magnetostatic model ,",
    "the same boundary conditions as for the non - linear force - free model are used in addition to prescribing the plasma pressure on the photospheric level in one chosen polarity .",
    "if the gravitational force is considered , then an initial atmosphere model will be needed .",
    "below , i list the important quantities that can be derived from the magnetic field extrapolations and which will lead to an in - depth physical interpretation of the magnetic field structure and coronal phenomena as described in sections  [ sec : qs ] and  [ sec : ar ] .",

    "* in spherical geometry , improving the spatial resolution of the pfss model is a first step , especially multigrids or nonuniform grids can be used .",

    "as an example , the comparison between the density derived from mhs models and the density obtained from spectrometers should be a systematic check of the goodness of the extrapolation .",
    "the main word for the development of extrapolation techniques using solar data as boundary conditions is quantitative .",

    " flat surface \" refers to a surface of constant curvature or radius ( _ e.g. _ , a plane or a sphere ) .",
    "the main issues that should be kept in mind when reconstructing a coronal magnetic field are :    * inversion of stokes parameters : the magnetic field components are derived from the radiative transfer equations for the four stokes parameters .",
    "the inversion is complex and often used by reconstruction modellers as a black box .",
    "one typical assumption is to consider that the solar atmosphere as a constant optical depth .",
    "this assumption with the assumption of a local thermodynamic equilibrium is becoming less and less accurate for high resolution data .",
    "* 180 degree ambiguity : after the inversion of the stokes parameters , an ambiguity of 180 degrees on the orientation of the transverse magnetic field still remains . some algorithms to resolve this ambiguity are based on a magnetic field model ( potential , lff , or nlff field ) .",
    "the goodness of the ambiguity is crucial , especially when a flux rope is present in the magnetic configuration . *",
    "flatness of the surface : as implied by the inversion of the stokes parameters , the measurement of the magnetic field in neighbouring pixels is certainly not at the same height in the photosphere .",
    "this fact is even more critical for chromospheric measurements . in order to currently perform a magnetic field extrapolation",
    ", it is assumed that the magnetogram corresponds to a flat surface .",
    "* the @xmath9-distribution : the definition of @xmath9 as seen in equation .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) is given by the normal component of the force - free equation .",
    "it means that a contribution from the electric currents perpendicular to the magnetic field is included into the @xmath9-distribution when the magnetic field is not strictly normal to the photospheric surface .",
    "the effects of the electric currents have to be investigated in more details . for extrapolation models beyond the force - free models",
    ", the components of the electric current density will be more appropriate boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "* error estimate : it is still difficult to estimate the error / inacurracy made in measuring the magnetic field : ( i ) the signal in sunspot is weak ( limited number of photons ) , ( ii ) the magnetic field in quiet sun regions is weak , ( iii ) the hanle effect can dominate the quiet - sun field , ( iv ) the linear polarisation signal leading to the transverse magnetic field is small compared to the stokes @xmath17 signal ( by an order of magnitude ) , ( v ) the properties of the spectral line such as the land factor can influence the threshold / saturation of the detected magnetic field strength , ( vi ) a pixel is not filled uniformly by magnetic field , so the filling factor is also an important quantity .",
    "error estimates from vector magnetograms can be incorporate in the extrapolation model resulting in a reliable equilibrium @xcite .",
    "* projection effect : the transverse field is strongly influenced by the projection effect , especially in the penumbra of sunspots where the magnetic field is mostly horizontal .",
    "this leads to the change of sign of observed polarities . * synoptic / carrington maps : often by default , the carrington maps have been corrected for the magnetic flux imbalance , which is good for extrapolation but do not represent correctly the physics of the solar surface magnetic field .    in the near future",
    ", we will see the development of new instruments which will provide us access to the magnetic field near the poles ( _ e.g. _ , solar orbiter ) and in the corona ( _ e.g. _ , comp ) .",
    "these improved measurements will impose new constraints on the physics of magnetic field extrapolations .",
    "in this review , i have summarised many different results obtained from magnetic field extrapolations combined with magnetic field observations .",
    "the extrapolations have been applied to various different issues in order to better understand the physics of the corona .",
    "owing to the large number of observations in strong field regions , most of the studies have dealt with the structure and evolution of the magnetic field in active regions , as well as studying the causes and consequences of flares and cmes .      *",
    "the current force - free models describe relatively well the structure of the coronal magnetic above active regions . *",
    "the amount of magnetic energy available is consistent with what is expected and observed during eruptive events , even if most of time , the studies do not specify error bars . *",
    "the existence of twisted flux bundles which are a prime ingredient in most of the mhd models to store magnetic energy in the corona , and trigger eruptions . * the physics of flares is closely related to the topology of the magnetic field prior to the eruption : existence of coronal null points , separators or quasi - spearatrix layers . *",
    "the large - scale connectivity of the magnetic field lines deduced from extrapolations is crucial to understanding of the redistribution of magnetic energy and magnetic helictiy in the solar corona . * the link between the broad range of observations ( from hard x - ray to radio wavelengths ) can be made through the structure of the magnetic field .      *",

    "the improvement in the understanding of the coronal magnetic field will depend on quantitative comparisons with the observations _ and not just qualitative comparisons .",
    "the quantitative success of the extrapolation method will _ a posteriori _ justify the physical assumptions or will drive the developements of these methods towards more physical and sophisticated techniques .",
    "the limits of these developments are the boundary conditions obtained by the observations , and the computational power available .",
    "especially , there is a need to improve the physics incorporated into these models : the coupling between the plasma and the magnetic field playing a major role in the evolution of the magnetic fields .",
