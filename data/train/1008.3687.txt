    "recently , thermopower of graphene systems have attracted much attention.@xcite in experiments on monolayer graphene ( mlg ) , while the high carrier density region is well accounted for in terms of the mott s relationship , the low carrier density region shows deviation away from this behavior.@xcite this is explained in terms of either an electron - hole puddle model@xcite or the coherence effect between the conduction band and the valence band mediated by impurity scattering@xcite . besides the mlg , a bilayer graphene ( blg ) system is also very interesting .",
    "the opening of a gap by an external electric field applied perpendicular to the layer planes @xcite introduces a new degree of tunability to the system and is recently shown by the authors to enhance greatly the thermopower.@xcite    despite the above progresses , several questions remain to be answered .",
    "first , the dependence of thermopower on carrier density as a function of temperature for a mlg has two features which are not fully explained in previous works .",
    "the first one is the shift of thermopower peak with respect to the charge neutral point as temperature decreases .",
    "in addition , thermopower shows a monotonic dependence on temperature for carrier densities smaller than that of the thermopower peak.@xcite the second question is the systematic dependence of thermopower on the number of layers .",
    "further more we are interested in finding out whether or not an applied biased potential will enhance thermopower for the multilayer graphene as the same as the bilayer system .",
    "below we shall address these questions .",
    "full microscopic calculations of thermopower of mlg in the presence of charged impurity scattering are performed in terms of the self - consistent born approximation .",
    "better agreement with experiments@xcite as compared with previously reported results are achieved.@xcite we also study thermopower of impure unbiased bilayer graphene . results which are qualitatively similar to those in monolayer graphene are obtained , but for much higher impurity concentrations .    for a multilayer graphene with layer number from two to six , we consider both the nearest neighbor tight binding model and the more general slonczewski - weiss - mcclure ( swmcc ) model.@xcite for a multilayer system the effect of screening is important in determining the band structure , as it produces non - uniform charge densities across the layers.@xcite in this work , by using the self - consistent hartree approximation we obtain potential energies of different layers for unbiased systems with three or more layers and biased systems with a perpendicular electric field for two or more layers . for unbiased graphene multilayers , peak values of the thermopower are close to each other irrespective of the model used . for a biased multilayer graphene , only thermopower of the bilayer shows significant enhancement , thermopower of the trilayers also increases slightly , but thermopower of systems with more layers decreases under a bias .",
    "the huge enhancement of thermopower in a bilayer graphene is a direct result of gap opening under a perpendicular electric bias.@xcite in a trilayer graphene , a much smaller gap opens and hence the thermopower enhancement is very small . while for layer number larger than three , no gap opens under a bias .",
