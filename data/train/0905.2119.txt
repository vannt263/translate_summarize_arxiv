    "quantum field theories in low dimensional spacetimes have been extensively studied in the past decades , due to their comparative simplicity and specific applications as effective models . among them , topological theories play an important hole , as the simplest examples of soluble systems .",
    "these models have a trivial dynamics , which depends only on the background topology . a greater understanding of topological theories in lower dimension was obtained when it was realized that they could be described with a combinatorial approach @xcite .",
    "a further step towards theories with non - trivial dynamics was attempted in @xcite , where quasitopological models in two dimensions were constructed on the lattice as a deformation of the topological lattice theories introduced in @xcite . in opposition to their topological counterparts ,",
    "quasitopological models have a non - trivial dynamics ; yet they are still simple enough to be exactly soluble .",
    "the dynamics depends not only on the topology , but also on the area of the surface .",
    "quasitopological theories include the usual two - dimensional yang - mills theories as examples , but are more general , in the sense that they describe models which can not be expressed as gauge theories .    in the characterization of the so - called quasitopological theories , the understanding that the combinatorial description could be used to afford more",
    "than purely topological information has proved to be fundamental .",
    "the quasitopological theories are based on a formalism similar to the one used in the description of topological theories , but with weaker symmetry conditions , chosen so that non - topological data become relevant @xcite .",
    "the combinatorial description leads in a natural way to an algebraic interpretation of the quasitopological theories . in this work",
    "it is shown that this algebraic formulation is compatible with additional structures which define a hopf algebra .",
    "hopf algebras are a natural extension of a group , offering a possible generalization for the concept of symmetry . in gauge theories , local symmetry",
    "is implemented by a gauge group .",
    "the question naturally arises of what are the local symmetries present in the more general quasitopological theories .",
    "we will show that , when the algebra describing the quasitopological model is a hopf algebra , there is a broader notion of symmetry : the local group symmetry is replaced by a hopf algebra local symmetry .",
    "hopf algebras are natural generalizations of groups .",
    "therefore it is natural to expect they play a central role in any extension of the concept of symmetry .",
    "quantum symmetries based on hopf algebras have been proposed in several contexts .",
    "an example is given by the spontaneously broken hopf symmetries in two - dimensional physical systems introduced in @xcite .",
    "hopf algebra symmetries could also be important in usual perturbative quantum field theories @xcite .",
    "hopf algebra structures underlying the ads / cft correspondence were studied in @xcite .",
    "the problem of defining a 2d lattice field theory with a hopf algebra symmetry was previously dealt with by buffenoir and roche in @xcite , where a solution for the case of a quasitriangular hopf algebra symmetry was presented .",
    "there a ciliation of the lattice triangulation is imposed to solve ambiguities in the deformed gauge symmetries , and the quasitriangular character of the hopf algebra is required for their non - commutative analogs .",
    "the same problem is investigated here with distinct methods , and a solution is described for an arbitrary triangulated compact two - dimensional surface and a semi - simple hopf algebra structure .",
    "character expansions are a powerful method in the analysis of two dimensional gauge theories . in the context of the yang - mills theory on the plane ,",
    "they were introduced by migdal @xcite .",
    "kazarov used this approach in compact spaces @xcite .",
    "an analogous technique will be presented in the context of quasitopological field theories , and quantities of interest will be calculated with this tool , such as explicit expressions for partition functions and correlation functions .",
    "the basic quantities in the usual yang - mills theories are the wilson loop expected values , and it is reasonable to expect that they also play a relevant part in the quasitopological theories .",
    "we will generalize the wilson loop for our context , and derive general expressions for the expected values of generalized wilson loops in terms of character expansions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : qtft - review ] , we shortly review the class of topological and quasitopological theories that we are going to investigate . in section [ sec : non - commutative - symmetries ] , we introduce the non - commutative symmetries which are implemented in the mentioned theories . in section",

    "some final comments are made in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "quasitopological models in the lattice were introduced and developed in @xcite . in order to fix notation ,",
    "a short review of the theory is presented in this section . for further details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the models are defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a triangulation of a bidimensional compact surface @xmath1 of genus @xmath2 , and let @xmath3 be some discrete set .",
    "consider a plaquette @xmath4 of @xmath0 .",
    "a variable @xmath5 is assigned to each link @xmath6 on the boundary of @xmath4 , with @xmath7 taking values in @xmath3 .",
    "these are the local configurations of the theory .",
    "a boltzman local weight @xmath8 is associated to each plaquette @xmath4 of @xmath0 , where the indices @xmath9 describe the configurations @xmath10 at the links on its boundary , and the symbol @xmath11 represents possible dependences of the plaquette weights on additional parameters of interest . an invertible gluing operator @xmath12 with inverse @xmath13 @xmath14 , is attached to each link . if two faces are glued along a common link , whose configurations are @xmath15 and @xmath16 at these faces , then there is a gluing weight @xmath17 associated to such link .",
    "the partition function @xmath18 of the model is defined by    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the total number of links , the first product runs over the plaquettes of @xmath0 , and the second product runs over the links of @xmath0 .",
    "the definition given in ( [ eq : z - geral ] ) encompasses a large family of lattice models . among them",
    "are the yang - mills lattice gauge theories with finite groups , as shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may think of ( [ eq : z - geral ] ) as defining a generalization of yang - mills theories .",
    "another class of examples is given by the topological models studied in @xcite .",
    "we will be interested in the class of quasitopological models consistent with this general form of the partition function , which were defined and studied in @xcite .    in the quasitopological models , the coefficients @xmath21 are such that the partition function is invariant under homeomorphisms which preserve the number of plaquettes . in other words , if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are homeomorphic bidimensional triangulations with the same number @xmath20 of plaquettes , then @xmath24 .",
    "this symmetry holds when the weights @xmath21 satisfy the flip move relation : @xmath25 where the gluing operator @xmath26 was used to raise indices , when upper indices appear .",
    "it may happen that for some critical value @xmath27 , the weights @xmath28 also satisfy the so - called bubble move relation : @xmath29 in this case , the restriction to triangulations with the same number of plaquettes is removed , and any pair of homeomorphic triangulations @xmath0 and @xmath30 have the same partition function , @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the model has topological symmetry at this critical value .",
    "a combinatorial interpretation of the tensorial identities ( [ eq : mov - flip ] ) and ( [ eq : mov - bolha ] ) is displayed in figure [ fig : moves ] .",
    "the pictorial identities are to be understood as follows . according to the definition given in ( [ eq : z - geral ] ) ,",
    "the partition function @xmath18 of a lattice @xmath32 is a tensorial expression determined by the combinatorial structure of @xmath32 . to any transformation of the lattice there",
    "corresponds a modification of some part of the associated tensorial expression .",
    "the identities ( [ eq : mov - flip ] ) and ( [ eq : mov - bolha ] ) ensure that the partition function is invariant under the two pachner moves existent in two dimensions , the flip and the bubble moves , whose action on dual graphs is displayed in figure [ fig : moves ] ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "these moves generate all homeomorphisms between triangulated bidimensional manifolds .",
    "a topological model must be invariant under both moves .",
    "quasitopological models are characterized by the weaker condition of invariance under the flip move only .",
    "the combinatorial definition of quasitopological models leads directly to an algebraic description . for simplicity , let @xmath3 be a finite set with @xmath33 elements",
    ". now define a vector space @xmath34 over @xmath35 with basis vectors @xmath36 . for each value of @xmath11",
    ", an algebraic structure can be introduced on @xmath34 with the definition of the product @xmath37 an immediate consequence of invariance under flip moves is that the algebras @xmath34 are associative , @xmath38 therefore , quasitopological theories are described by associative algebras .",
    "moreover , it was proved in @xcite that a finite - dimensional algebra @xmath34 describes a topological model if and only if it is associative and semi - simple : invariance under the bubble move is equivalent to the condition of semi - simplicity .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the computation of the partition function @xmath18 of a quasitopological model for any two dimensional lattice surface can be reduced to an one dimensional problem .",

    "further steps will be given in this direction .",
    "the continuum limit is obtained by taking the number @xmath20 of plaquettes going to infinity .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 is interpreted as the area of each plaquette .",
    "we let @xmath11 approach zero with the total area @xmath46 of the surface kept constant .",
    "therefore @xmath11 and @xmath20 are related by @xmath47 .",
    "as we shall see , if @xmath48 is a critical point , then the model has a well defined continuum limit . at this critical point , the full topological symmetry",
    "is restored @xcite . in this case , the quasitopological models can be considered a perturbation of the topological models introduced in @xcite , and one finds that @xmath49_a^b \\longrightarrow \\left[\\textrm{e}^{\\alpha b}\\right]_a^b \\ , ,   \\label{k_continuo}\\ ] ] and @xmath50 where @xmath51 satisfies the relation ( [ eq : mov - bolha ] ) . thus the algebra @xmath52 describes a topological model .",
    "the operator @xmath53 is defined by its matrix elements @xmath54 , given by @xmath55\\right|_{\\epsilon=0}=\\left.\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\epsilon}k_{ij}(\\epsilon)\\right|_{\\epsilon=0 } \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] and it follows that @xmath56 moreover , any @xmath57 satisfying relations ( [ eq : omega - a ] ) defines a quasitopological model in the continuum limit .",
    "these conditions can be written in a more convenient form .",
    "the operator @xmath53 can be interpreted as a linear functional @xmath58 whose action on basis elements is given by @xmath59 .",
    "then the conditions ( [ eq : omega - a ] ) reduce to @xmath60 the set of bilinear forms which satisfy ( [ eq : omega - a - forms ] ) is denoted @xmath61 .",
    "it comes that the set of quasitopological models in the continuum limit is parametrized by a semi - simple algebra @xmath62 together with an element of @xmath61 .",
    "it is simple to show that @xmath61 is isomorphic to the space @xmath63 of linear functionals over @xmath62 for which @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "one explicit isomorphism @xmath66 is given by @xmath67 therefore , it is sufficient to consider @xmath63 in order to study @xmath61 .    in the case where @xmath68 , the group completeness and the orthogonality conditions for the group characters lead to a convenient parametrization of @xmath63 and allow for the explicit calculation of @xmath69 .",
    "one of the main goals of this work is to generalize these results .",
    "but before attacking this point , some additional structure will be given to the quasitopological models , in order that a generalization of the usual notion of symmetry can be introduced and explored .",
    "the dynamics of quasitopological field theories is codified in a set of observables analog to the wilson loops of lattice field theories .",
    "the symmetries of the theory are described in terms of these observables .",
    "one finds that the traditional gauge group symmetry of lattice gauge theories can be extended to a hopf algebra symmetry acting locally on the variables of the theory .",
    "the definition of propagators in quasitopological theories is similar to the one given by atyiah for topological field theories in @xcite .",
    "a surface @xmath0 with boundary @xmath70 , where the union is disjoint , is assumed to describe a time - evolution from the physical space @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "a hilbert space @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is assigned to @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , and to the surface @xmath0 there corresponds a propagator @xmath75 . in the case of quasitopological field theories , an explicit concrete description is possible , due to the available knowledge in two - dimensional topology .",
    "two results are central to the construction of these theories .",
    "first , there is the fact that two - dimensional manifolds ( orientable and connected ) with boundary are easily classified , up to homeomorphisms : they are all spherical surfaces with some number @xmath76 of holes in it , and @xmath2 handles attached to it .",
    "therefore , the boundary of any two - dimensional lattice is always a disjoint union of loops .",
    "second , any such lattice can be constructed by gluing simpler pieces : three - holed spheres , sometimes called trinions , and cylinders .",
    "so one can define propagators of trinions and cylinders only , gluings being later used to construct propagators of arbitrary surfaces .",
    "so consider a single loop with @xmath33 links at the boundary of some surface .",
    "we would like to assign a complex vector space to it .",
    "it was observed in the last section that a finite - dimensional algebra @xmath77 is naturally associated with any quasitopological theory , and that a basis of @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 , where @xmath3 indexes the local configurations of the model .",
    "we just attach an internal space @xmath77 to each link , so that the loop itself has a vector space @xmath79 associated with it . for a disjoint union of loops ,",
    "we take the tensor product of the corresponding spaces .",
    "a natural interpretation for the vectors @xmath80 is that a basis vector @xmath81 describes a state in which the loop has definite configurations @xmath82 at its links .",
    "a general state @xmath83 is a superposition of states with definite configurations at links .",
    "now a propagator must be assigned to each surface . for simplicity , consider first the case of a cylinder .",
    "the boundary of this surface is build up of two loops @xmath84 .",
    "these are described by hilbert spaces @xmath79 and @xmath85 , with bases @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the surface must be described by an operator @xmath88 . in order to define this operator ,",
    "it is enough to describe its action on basis vectors .",
    "so write @xmath89 and let us describe how the coefficients @xmath90 are calculated . first , fix configurations @xmath91 at the links of @xmath92 , and configurations @xmath93 at the links of @xmath94",
    ". then consider an expression similar to the one employed in the definition of the partition function : @xmath95 where the sum now runs over configurations on internal links only , the first product over all plaquettes , and the second product over internal links . the coefficients @xmath90 are defined as @xmath96 this defines the cylinder propagator .",
    "configurations are fixed at the boundary components , which are all loops , while internal configurations are summed over .",
    "a similar procedure is used for more general surfaces . in the case of a trinion",
    ", there are three sets of indices corresponding to the three loops at its boundary , leading to coefficients @xmath97 , which describe a propagator @xmath98 .",
    "any other propagator can be obtained from the propagators of cylinders and trinions with the interpretation of gluings of surfaces as contractions of indices in the corresponding propagators , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath99 and @xmath97 were given in @xcite .",
    "they involve the boundary configurations only through wilson loop variables @xmath100 defined as @xmath101 where the matrix coefficients of the operator @xmath102 are defined by @xmath103 since propagators refer to these quantities only , wilson loops are regarded as the physical observables of the theory .",
    "let us describe a class of transformations which preserves the propagators , up to some factors .",
    "we consider the case where @xmath77 is not only a semi - simple algebra , but a semi - simple hopf algebra @xcite , i.e. there is a coproduct , a counit and an antipode which satisfy all hopf algebra axioms .",
    "consider a particular loop , say with @xmath33 links , so that the loop space is @xmath79 .",
    "the transformations are described by the algebra @xmath104 generated by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the identity .",
    "the pictorial interpretation is that @xmath107 is localized at the @xmath108th vertice of the loop ( see figure  [ gauge - transf ] ) : the action of @xmath109 on the loop space @xmath79 is defined in such a manner that the generator @xmath110 affects link variables only at links @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( taking into account the periodicity of the link ) , just like gauge transformations in usual gauge theories .",
    "more specifically , the transformation @xmath110 is defined on basis vectors of @xmath79 by @xmath113 where @xmath114 are the coefficients of the coproduct @xmath115 , and @xmath116 is the antipode of the hopf algebra @xmath77 .",
    "the wilson loops remain practically unchanged under these transformations , due to the hopf algebra axioms .",
    "these variables depend only on products @xmath117 of link variables .",
    "the factor @xmath118 changes under the action of @xmath110 according to @xmath119 which simplifies to @xmath120 due to the antipode relation , where @xmath121 are the coefficients of the counit @xmath122 .",
    "thus the wilson loop @xmath123 is invariant under generalized gauge transformation , up to a numerical factor . for a generic element @xmath124 , @xmath125 the action on an element @xmath126",
    "is given by @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the numerical factor @xmath129 we recall that this factor is also present in usual gauge theories where the algebra is nothing but the group algebra ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , as in the case of usual gauge theories , the generalized wilson loop is invariant under the entire group algebra only up to a factor , as given by eq ( [ factor_w ] ) .",
    "in this section , we deal with the algebra @xmath62 of a topological model in more detail .",
    "the limit @xmath62 of @xmath77 for @xmath130 is the relevant algebra for computing the continuum limit .",
    "we recall that @xmath77 is semi - simple when @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , we derive useful properties of the characters associated with representations of @xmath62 , namely the completeness and orthogonality of the irreducible characters of the algebra . in the case where @xmath131 is the group algebra associated with a finite group @xmath132",
    ", there are many ways of proving the orthogonality of the characters .",
    "we have found that the proof presented in @xcite can be adapted to the case of semi - simple algebras .",
    "the starting point is the decomposition of the algebra in irreducible representations .",
    "it can be proved that any semi - simple algebra @xmath133 , when considered as a @xmath133-module acting on itself , can be written as a direct sum @xmath134 where all @xmath135 are irreducible representations of @xmath133 .",
    "the decomposition has the following properties :    * every irreducible representation @xmath136 of @xmath133 is isomorphic to some @xmath135 ; * the number of @xmath135 such that @xmath137 is equal to the dimension of @xmath136 .",
    "but @xmath133 is a finite - dimensional algebra .",
    "since it has at least one copy of each irreducible representation , it follows that the number of irreducible representations is finite , up to isomorphisms .",
    "we denote the irreducible isomorphism classes by @xmath138 .",
    "all elements of the same class have the same dimension @xmath139 and character @xmath140 .",
    "another preliminary result is that any semi - simple algebra admits an involution  @xmath141 which turns it into a @xmath142 algebra .",
    "that follows from wedderburn theorem @xcite , which states that any semi - simple algebra @xmath133 over the field @xmath35 can be written as @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the @xmath145 matrix algebra with entries on @xmath35 . defining the involution @xmath141 as hermitian conjugation on these matrices algebras , @xmath133 becomes a @xmath141-algebra .",
    "more structure can be introduced .",

    "we use them to define a bilinear form @xmath152 whose action on basis elements is given by @xmath153 with the involution @xmath141 , the sesquilinear form @xmath154 can be constructed in @xmath133 .",
    "it can be verified that such form is a scalar product . in turn , that allows us to define a nice norm @xmath155 .",
    "consider the operators @xmath156 , @xmath157 , defined by @xmath158 .",
    "we just put @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the norm operator .",
    "these structures collected together satisfy all @xmath161 algebra axioms .",
    "stating it shortly , any semi - simple algebra is a @xmath161 algebra . in fact , the reverse is also true : all finite - dimensional @xmath162 algebras are isomorphic to a semi - simple algebra @xcite , so that there exists a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath161 algebras and topological lattice models .    the irreducible characters @xmath140 are elements of @xmath163 , the dual space of @xmath133 .",
    "the metric @xmath12 defines an isomorphism between @xmath133 and @xmath163 , and we use it to carry the scalar product from one space to the other .",

    "the irreducible characters @xmath170 of @xmath133 can be verified to be orthogonal , @xmath171 .",
