    "apart from global density and temperature radial profiles , fundamental information on the physics of the icm is contained in the small - scale deviations of the icm properties from this global model .",
    "understanding the nature of the perturbations is particularly important to constrain conduction and viscosity in hot gaseous atmospheres of galaxies , groups , and clusters and to probe physical mechanisms driving these perturbations .",

    "the key question is an objective characterization of these perturbations .",
    "properties of the perturbations not only reflect the driving mechanisms behind them , but also depend on the microphysics of the icm , in particular , on the thermal conduction and viscosity .",
    "one possible way of revealing the nature of the perturbations is via measuring the correlation between density and temperature fluctuations , to construct an effective `` equation of state '' for the perturbations .",
    "for example , a positive correlation between temperature and density fluctuations suggests that the gas is adiabatically compressed , while a negative correlation hints at isobaric perturbations , associated with entropy fluctuations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we factorize the hardness ratio map into large - scale and small - scale maps , using chandra data on the perseus cluster for illustration . in the rest of the paper we use ( and",

    "this procedure can be much simplified if the temperature variations are not very large .",
    "we describe below two techniques that provide a quick replacement for an often lengthy direct fitting procedures .",
    "one possible way of quickly constructing a projected temperature map of a cluster @xcite is to make a taylor expansion of the plasma emissivity @xmath0 with respect to small changes of temperature @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the photon energy , @xmath4 is a small deviation of temperature from a reference value . the functions of energy in the r.h.s . ,",

    "once the maps of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are generated , they can be ( adaptively ) smoothed and combined to determine the value of the temperature , which in the simplest form is @xmath16 see @xcite for a more accurate version of this expression , that ensures that the value of @xmath1 is recovered exactly not only at the boundaries of the @xmath17 $ ] interval , but also at @xmath18 .",
    "a comparison with the results of direct fitting has shown that despite the simplicity of the method , the derived values of temperature are accurate and have similar statistical uncertainty .",
    "the temperature map of the perseus cluster obtained from chandra observations , in this way , is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tmap ] .    as a caveat",
    ", we mention that this procedure assumes that all other parameters , e.g. , abundance of heavy elements or low energy photoelectric absorption , do not affect the hardness rato .",
    "in fact , in the very core of the perseus cluster there are clear signes of strong low - energy absorption features ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that do affect hardness ratio ( see text and figures below ) . in the rest of the paper",
    "we ignore the regions that are known to be affected by the low energy absorption .",
    "an even simpler approach is to use hardness - ratio maps , based on the images in two sufficiently different energy bands , which we designate below as @xmath19 and @xmath20 , corresponding to energy intervals @xmath21 $ ] @xmath22 $ ] .",

    "this means that a notorious problem of having noisy data in the denominator is avoided by a suitable choice of global models @xmath30 and @xmath31 , subject to the condition that deviations from these models are small .",
    "the implication is that we can avoid excessive smoothing of observed images needed to suppress noise in the expression @xmath45 .",
    "in the above section we have factorized the hardness ratio @xmath40 into `` global '' and `` perturbed '' parts .",
    "below we use a similar approach to single out and characterize the properties of the icm perturbations on small scales .    as a first step , we want to calculate the variations of the plasma volume emissivity in a given band @xmath46 , due to the density and temperature variations . here",

    "isobaric perturbations , associated with entropy variations of the gas lumps in pressure equilibrium with each other , could be due to slow displacement of fluid elements from their equilibrium positions ( e.g. , gravity waves ) .",
    "apparently `` isothermal '' perturbations could be due to bubbles of relativistic plasma , which are devoid of x - ray emitting gas ; if the pressure of the relativistic plasma matches the ambient gas pressure , the bubbles will be seen as x - ray - dim `` cavities '' , suggesting a drop of thermal - gas density without apparent changes in the gas temperature .    as in ",

    "[ fig : xia ] , in addition , suggests that there is an envelope of decreased thermal pressure in between the inner lobes ( the figure-8-like structure ) and older bubbles .",
    "it likely that this envelope is due to relativistic plasma occupying a fraction of volume around the inner lobes .",
    "another way to characterize the observed fluctuations is to correlate the amplitudes in @xmath162 and @xmath163 pixel by pixel directly ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jcor ] ) .",
    "the three lines shown in fig .  [ fig : jcor ] correspond to the expected correlation between fluxes in the soft and hard bands for adiabatic , isothermal and isobaric fluctuations , respectively .",
    "as is clear from this figure , all large positive perturbations correspond to isobaric perturbations ( blue line ) . in the original images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dbs ] ) , those perturbations correspond to the prominent spiral - like structure . at the same time",
    ", large negative deviations follow an isothermal eos .",
    "these perturbations correspond to x - ray cavities ( radio bubbles ) , visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : dbs ] as dark patches .    to study smaller - amplitude perturbations that are too weak to be identified individually (",
    "given the noise in the image ) , a cross - spectrum approach (  [ sec : cs ] ) is a better option to characterize the mean correlation between the perturbations .",
    "moreover , scale - dependent nature of the cross - spectrum analysis helps avoid the impact of larger - scale asymmetries on the resulting correlations .",
    "this approach was followed for the perseus cluster by @xcite and for m87 by @xcite and confirmed that isobaric perturbations dominate the overall energy budget associated with perturbations . since all three manipulated images in fig .",
    "[ fig : xia ] are shown in the same color scale , one can immediately see that in terms of variance , isobaric fluctuations clearly dominate .",
    "however , in order to estimate the energy associated with the perturbations one has either to assume a particular geometry , as was done for bubbles in many studies , or to assume that the power spectrum of the perturbations in 3d is isotropic . in the latter case",
    ", the power spectrum analysis recovers the correct normalization of the 3d power spectrum and can be used to estimate the total energy in the perturbations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "[ fig : dbs_m87 ] and [ fig : xia_m87 ] show a similar analysis for m87 images . as discussed by @xcite the 3.5 - 7.5 kev band image of m87 ( fig.[fig : dbs_m87 ] ,",
    "right ) by itself provides a projected thermal pressure map ( more accurately , projected square of the pressure ) . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] it is clear that for the characteristic gas temperature in m87 , @xmath164  kev , the response to isobaric perturbations in this energy band is indeed close to zero . it is therefore not surprising that the manipulated image free from isobaric perturbations ( fig.[fig : xia_m87 ] , right ) look very similar to the original 3.5 - 7.5 kev band image .    inspection of figs .",
    "[ fig : xia ] and [ fig : xia_m87 ] suggests that , in terms of the density perturbation amplitude , the isobaric structures dominate , followed by bubbles ( may still be isobaric , but with a significant contribution to pressure from either relativistic particles or very hot gas ) and weak shocks .",
    "such a hierarchy is best explained in a `` slow '' agn feedback scenario , when much of the mechanical energy output of a central black hole is captured by the bubble enthalpy that is gradually released during buoyant rise of the bubble .",
    "we have presented a set of methods that help reveal the ( thermodynamic ) nature of the gas perturbations , observed in relaxed galaxy clusters .",
    "a modified hardness - ratio approach separates global variations of the projected temperature and small - scale substructure . as a result",
    "one can avoid excessive noise in the hardness - ratio maps , since a division of observed images , which are often noisy , is replaced by a subtraction of properly scaled images .",
    "an extension of the same technique to the `` image arithmetic '' works best for prominent structure and for datasets with excellent statistics , visualizing the perturbations with a given effective equation of state . for a global statistical characterization of many small perturbations ,",
    "the cross - power - spectrum approach is more appropriate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "all the methods that have been proposed are easy to implement and computationally fast .",
    "the above analysis makes two main simplifying assumptions .",
    "firstly , we assume that one can make a good guess about the `` unperturbed '' analytic model , since perturbations are calculated relative to this model .",
    "if the perturbations are on small scales , then an equivalent assumption is that the unperturbed model is very smooth on the same scales .",
    "secondly , it is assumed that all perturbations have small amplitudes , so all terms of order @xmath165 can be neglected . while there are always modest departures from these assumptions , the comparison of the manipulated images with the radio data and with the results of detailed spectral analysis suggests that this approach successfully classifies the types of perturbations and helps to reveal their nature .",
