    "in this study we describe a search to detect the infrared a - x bands of the alo radical .",
    "while several oxide molecules like tio and vo are routinely encountered in the spectra of cool o - rich stars , alo is detected rarely and is hence a poorly studied molecule .",
    "but , as we proceed to show , alo could be detected more often if searched for in appropriate sources .",
    "the motivation for the study arose from two eruptive variables v838 mon and v4332 sgr which have been objects of great interest in recent years .",
    "both objects underwent initial large - amplitude nova - like outbursts but it was soon realized that they were different from classical novae or other known classes of cvs ( e.g. munari et al . 2002 ) .",
    "worth mentioning specifically is the haloed status achieved by v838 mon by virtue of the striking light echo that adorned it @xcite .",
    "a general consensus exists today that they belong to a new class of eruptive variables called intermediate luminosity red transients ( ilrts ; @xcite ) . with the discovery of several more such red transients in recent times @xcite , and the likelihood of more discoveries emerging from ongoing synoptic sky surveys ,",
    "there is currently a great deal of interest in such objects .",
    "our concern here is with the unusual presence of rarely seen molecular bands of the a - x system of alo radical , which are strongly seen in the near - infrared spectra of v838 mon and v4332 sgr and which could potentially be expected in other ilrts too . in v838 mon , these alo bands were seen in absorption @xcite ; in v4332 sgr they were spectacularly seen in emission @xcite . barring v838 mon , v4332 sgr and iras 18530 + 0817 @xcite",
    ", a search in the literature shows a severe paucity of a - x band detections of alo in other sources and a strong need therefore arose to understand why the a - x bands were detected so infrequently .",
    "it was perceived that a statistically larger number of detections of the band would help to understand the characteristics and properties of alo better .",
    "an alo detection could also help in exploring its role in the formation of alumina dust .",
    "alumina is considered to be the earliest dust condensate in o - rich stars - condensing out at 1760k . in the chaotic silicate hypothesis ,",
    "the alo radical plays a pivotal role in silicate and alumina dust formation ( nuth @xmath1 hecht , 1990 ) .",
    "observationally too , it was intriguing to see strong alo emission in v4332 sgr being simultaneously accompanied by a strong 11 @xmath2 m alumina feature @xcite .",
    "but the interconnection between a gas phase component ( alo ) and a solid state component ( alumina ) needs further study and a statistically large sample of alo detections should be helpful . from the observational point of view , it is timely to plan or carry out such observations with the present availability of ir space - borne facilities like sofia ( stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ) and of the james webb space telescope in the near future .",
    "while the mid - ir dust features could be studied by the space - borne facilities , the near - ir alo bands could be simultaneously studied from the ground .",
    "the present study could also help explore an important issue viz .",
    "the radioactive @xmath0al content in agb stars as discussed in section 3 .",
    "finally , it should also be noted that the first millimeter detection of alo has been recently made in the o - rich supergiant star vy cma @xcite which could lead to similar searches in other objects .",
    "the sources detected here could hence be potential targets for such further mm / radio detections ; the different transitions occurring in the mm / radio regimes are given in @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that a search for near - ir alo bands had been made earlier too .",
    "@xcite had looked for the ( 1,0 ) bands in selected supergiants and mira variables but failed to detect them due to miscalculated wavelength positions of the bands ( the molecular constants were poorly known then ) .",
    "the wavelengths of the different a - x bands are now well determined from the detailed study of the alo radical by @xcite .",
    "the principal result reported here is the near - ir detection of several bands of alo in the 1.01.35 micron region .",
    "these detections are made in 13 out of 17 pre - selected sources thereby giving a high detection rate of almost 75 percent .",
    "our study shows that the a - x bands are thus not so rare and that they should be fairly prevalent in low temperature , o - rich environments .",
    "the strategy for source selection was based on the excitation conditions for the a - x bands which arise from transitions between different vibrational levels of the excited a and the ground x electronic states .",
    "the vibrational states are low - lying , typically 0.6 to 1 ev above ground level @xcite and are thus expected to be favorably excited at low temperatures .",
    "this is consistent with their appearance in v838 mon and v4332 sgr , both of which have cool dusty envelopes with t @xmath3 1000k @xcite .",
    "alo emission may therefore be expected from similar stellar environments viz .",
    "the dusty circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars .",
    "a criterion that the @xmath4 color should be large was hence applied to ensure selection of such sources .",
    "we set @xmath5 @xmath6 4 and chose bright sources to optimize telescope time requirement by setting @xmath7 @xmath3 10 .",
    "a search of the 2mass point source catalog with these constraints yielded 487 sources .",
    "the sample was reduced by ensuring the sources showed the 10 and 18 @xmath2 m silicate features in their iras spectra ( olnon et al .",
    "1986 ) indicating the o - rich environment necessary for alo .",
    "a further constraint was that the 10 @xmath2 m silicate feature be broad or display a clearly discernible 11 @xmath2 m alumina feature on its red wing .",
    "such profiles , it has been argued @xcite , suggest the presence of alumina and hence strengthen the possibility of alo being present . a final reduction to 17 sources",
    "was made considering source accessibility ( ra and @xmath8 constraints ; @xmath8 was set @xmath6 @xmath940 degrees ) from the 3.8 m uk infrared telescope ( ukirt ) where the observations were planned and made .",
    "observations were performed with the ukirt 1 - 5 micron imager spectrometer ( uist ) , using an ij grism and a 4-pix ( 0.48\")-wide slit ; the spectra obtained cover a wavelength range of 0.86 @xmath2 m  1.4 @xmath2 m with a spectral resolution of @xmath10320 .",
    "observations of a flat , arc and an early type ( b9v - a2v ) ratioing star were obtained with the same instrument setting as for the program objects before each set of observations . before rationing the spectrum of the source with the spectrum of the telluric standard ,",
    "the hydrogen pa @xmath11 and pa @xmath12 absorption features in the spectrum of the latter were removed .",
    "the initial processing of the data were carried out using the ukirt pipeline oracdr ; the extraction and calibration of the spectra were carried out using starlink - figaro and iraf .",

    "the 1.2863 @xmath2 m component of the ( 5,1 ) band is also clearly seen while a small but discernible dip is also seen at the position of the counterpart 1.2661 @xmath2 m feature .",
    "also there are discernible bandheads at the predicted positions of the ( 5,0 ) bands at 1.1443 and 1.1281 @xmath2 m indicating that these bands are also present .",

    "the only case of overlapping of features is between the 1.2424 @xmath2 m component of the tio @xmath27 ( 0,1 ) system and the 1.2417 @xmath2 m alo feature . using the molecular constants from jorgensen ( 1994 ; see figure 5 )",
    ", the @xmath27 system is expected to produce the ( 0,1 ) and ( 1,2 ) band heads at 1.2424 and 1.2568 @xmath2 m respectively . in the spectra ,",
    "the 1.2568 @xmath2 m tio bandhead is weak but is still consistently seen in the spectra ( its position is marked in figure 1 ) .",
    "the only other tio feature that is seen is the @xmath27 ( 0,0 ) system with its bandhead at 1.1035 @xmath2 m .",
    "the deep absorption at the red end of the @xmath7 band due to water in the source makes it difficult to comment on the possible presence of the ( 3,0 ) bands at 1.3589 and 1.3358 @xmath2 m .",
    "the 1.3358 @xmath2 m band was seen in v4332 sgr where water absorption was weak @xcite .",
    "vo has two prominent a - x bands in this region namely vo ( 0,0 ) with its bandhead at 1.056 @xmath2 m and vo(1,1 ) extending between 1.1682 @xmath2 m to 1.2158 @xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "both these bands are seen in the spectra of several stars @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the vo(0,1 ) band is present but strongly contaminated with the alo ( 6,1 ) bands .",
    "the reason for this is that vo ( 0,1 ) is known not to have any conspicuous bandhead as pointed out by hinkle et al .",
    "( 1989 , see table 2 therein ) who therefore while assigning a wavelength to this band give a central frequency rather than a bandhead frequency .",
    "the spectra of r cas in joyce et al .",
    "( 1998 , figure 3 therein ) also supports this where it is seen that while vo ( 0,0 ) has a sharp bandhead , vo ( 0,1 ) on the other hand displays a broad feature without a significant bandhead .",
    "however in our spectra a prominent bandhead is seen at the onset of the vo ( 0,1 ) band which we feel is instead due to the 1.1659 @xmath2 m band of alo ( 6,1 ) .",
    "in addition , there is also a clear indentation in the vo ( 0,1 ) feature at @xmath10 1.184 @xmath2 m that coincides with the 1.1834 alo ( 6,1 ) component .",
    "we hence infer that although vo ( 0,1 ) may be present , the ( 6,1 ) bands of alo are also present in the 1.16 to 1.21 @xmath2 m region .    in many of the spectra in figures 1 and 2 , especially those in the latter ,",
    "an absorption feature at 1.1345 @xmath2 m appears to be seen which does not correspond with any of the expected molecular features .",
    "this is likely to be an artifact arising from a strong h@xmath26o telluric absorption feature expected at this position .",
    "this feature appears to have been incompletely removed in the ratioing process due to the slight airmass differences between the source and standard star during observations ( as indicated in table 1 ) .",
    "an intriguing result is the variation seen in the spectrum of the source iras 18530 + 0817 .",
    "this is the only source from our list which has been studied in detail in the near and mid - infrared earlier @xcite . a comparison between our @xmath7 band spectrum and a similar one taken on 19 may 1995 by walker et al .",
    "( 1997 , figure 2a therein ) shows considerable changes .",
    "alo absorption bands are prominently seen in the 1995 spectrum but have disappeared in our spectrum ( the source is included in the non - detections in figure 2 ) . the h paschen @xmath11 line at 1.2818 @xmath2 m",
    "is also seen in emission in our data .",
    "interestingly the 10 @xmath2 m silicate profile , which shows a clear alumina component at 11 @xmath2 m , is also found to vary .",
    "most striking is the change in the 10 @xmath2 m profile in the two iras spectra , taken in 1983 and separated by 6 months , wherein a large decrease in intensity level as well as striking changes in the profile morphology are seen .",
    "the bright emission feature at 9.5 @xmath2 m ( due to silicates ) remains relatively unaltered whereas the emission component around 11@xmath2 m ( presumably due to alumina ) has almost disappeared .",
    "since alo is also established to be varying in the source , it will be interesting to take simultaneous @xmath28 spectra of the alo bands as well as that of the 11 @xmath2 m alumina feature and see what kind of a correlation is found . from an astrochemistry point of view , this may be a meaningful study as discussed in section 1 .",
    "the variation of the alo band strengths in iras 18530 + 0817 may be a sign of a more generic trait in variability .",
    "it may be related to the anomalous variation of the optical b - x bands of alo , notably the ( 0,0 ) 4842   band , in mira variables reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite conclude that the strength of the alo bands can be quite different in two mira variables of the same temperature and the same star observed at two different maxima can have extremely different alo strengths ( hence the anomalous behavior ) .",
    "this variation in strengths from cycle to cycle is not shared by other molecules like sco and vo which vary predictably with spectral type .",
    "the bands are occasionally found to go into emission from absorption and we speculate that this must be similarly happening to iras 18530 + 0817 , and possibly the other stars with non - detections in figure 2 , wherein the alo absorption features may have been filled in by emission ( the paschen @xmath11 line going into emission could be an indication of this ) .",
    "the anomalous behavior of the b - x bands is still an unexplained phenomenon .",
    "an alo detection could open the door for a subsequent search for radioactive @xmath0al in the object .",
    "the same a - x band of alo , with the al atom therein being either @xmath0al or @xmath29al , can be sufficiently separated in wavelength to be resolved at intermediate / high spectral resolution @xcite .",
    "for example , our calculations show that the origin of the ( 4,0 ) bands of @xmath29al@xmath30o and @xmath0al@xmath30o occur at 1.22558 and 1.22053 @xmath2 m respectively and hence resolving even individual rotational lines should be possible at higher resolution .",
    "the yield of @xmath0al/@xmath29al in agb stars has been the subject of considerable study ( e.g reviews by @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it may be noted that the bulk of our positive alo detections are in oh / ir stars and mira variables which are essentially agb stars .",
    "the oh / ir stars in particular are very evolved stars belonging to the tip of the agb branch enroute to their becoming planetary nebulae .",
    "low mass agb stars ( @xmath31 3 to 4 m@xmath32 ) produce relatively smaller amounts of @xmath0al primarily from hydrogen shell burning @xcite while @xmath0al production is enhanced in high mass and super agb stars @xcite due to the process of hot bottom burning and the third dredge up process . the theoretical @xmath0al/@xmath29al yield can be compared directly with observed yields in stardust grains in meteoritic samples . for o - rich atmospheres considered in this study",
    ", oxide grains need to be considered and from @xcite the expected yield of @xmath0al/@xmath29al in a typical low - mass 1.5m@xmath33 agb star is seen to lie between 10@xmath34 to 10@xmath35 .",
    "the highest values are reached after the star has undergone several thermal pulses - a situation relevant for the evolved oh / ir stars . in high mass agb stars",
    ", the @xmath0al/@xmath29al yield may be even higher @xcite . at the low yield values of 10@xmath34 , detecting the the @xmath0alo component against the @xmath29alo emission background will be challenging spectroscopically .",
    "however , at the higher yields the chance of a detection should be good . in any case , even being able to observationally set a well - constrained upper limit on the @xmath0al/@xmath29al ratio should be useful ( especially since the rate for the key reaction @xmath0al(p,@xmath12 ) @xmath29si that destroys @xmath0al is largely uncertain ; @xcite ) .",
    "a robust @xmath0al detection should also help in tightly constraining the contribution of agb stars to the galactic @xmath0al emission manifested through the 1.8 mev @xmath12 ray line .",
    "the research work at physical research laboratory is funded by the department of space , government of india .",
