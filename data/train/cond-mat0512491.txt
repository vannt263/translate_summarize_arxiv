    "low - dimensional disordered excitonic systems have generated renewed interest recently .",
    "for example , the possibility of using optically active polymers in various photonic applications such as flat panel displays and light emitting diodes has led to increased interest in their electronic and optical properties @xcite .",
    "we study here numerically the dynamics of frenkel excitons near the band center in a system with nearest - neighbor off - diagonal random interactions .",
    "this study is , we believe , the first to treat correlated disorder in the off - diagonal dipolar interactions in an exciton system which focuses on the behavior near band center @xmath1 .",
    "however , an analysis of a similar problem in the correlated electronic system has appeared @xcite but the authors considered correlations those were different from ours , and the interactions were not of the dipolar type @xcite .",
    "many efforts have also been spent on the same off - diagonal tight - binding system using supersymmetric methods ( susy ) @xcite where the interactions are formally similar to our dipolar interactions but the authors eventually worked with continuous variables whereas ours are discrete . later , correlated disorder , in particular the exponential type , was included for the same tight binding model using the susy @xcite .",
    "our results can thus be compared with what has been developed for the susy methods .",
    "this study is important because most realistic random disordered systems have nonlocal correlations .",
    "the nature of the excitations at the band center of random off - diagonal exciton models has been discussed for a long time , and it has been found that the spectrum has a singularity of the dyson type @xcite in which spectral properties in the vicinity of the band center are functions of @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy relative to the center of the band . the question of the band center localization has also been argued at length , and it was claimed that the band center mode may be weakly localized because of the strong fluctuations @xcite .",
    "ziman @xcite analyzing various uncorrelated distributions of the random coupling found the low - energy behavior of the integrated density of states ( @xmath4 )    @xmath5    and the inverse localization length ( @xmath6 )    @xmath7    in which @xmath3 is  the energy and the logarithmic variance @xcite @xmath8 } $ ] is the amplitude factor , @xmath9 being the off - diagonal coupling specified below .",
    "for definitions of the @xmath6 and the @xmath4 see ziman s work @xcite particularly his discussion after the equation of the motion .",
    "notice that the averages above are independent of the lattice site @xmath10 since uncorrelated random variables are involved ; otherwise they are site dependent .",
    "concerning the shape of the @xmath4 and the @xmath6 , according to ziman s analysis @xcite , they should depend on disorder only through a multiplicative constant , the variance in the distribution of @xmath11 . as a result ,",
    "the spectra near @xmath12 have the same form for all sets of independent , identically distributed random variables @xmath9 . in this context , such a property is referred to as scaling . when there is scaling , the data can be collapsed onto a single curve by dividing through by a factor that depends on the properties of the disorder but",
    "is independent of the energy .",
    "although the above mentioned results were developed for uncorrelated disorder , our analysis shows that qualitatively similar scaling behavior for limited range of concentrations and energy can be obtained for a system with exponential correlations but with a modified amplitude factor @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , for a certain range of correlation lengths a higher order expansion of the dyson singularity can reproduce the numerical data better than just a single term .    a disordered 1d exciton model with nearest - neighbor interactions has the following equation of motion    @xmath14    where @xmath15 denotes the usual exciton creation operator and @xmath16 are the couplings .",
    "this is equivalent to the xy model in a strong applied field in the @xmath17-direction ( @xmath18 ) . in our numerics we calculated iteratively",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xcite @xmath19 ( see appendix ) , where @xmath20 is the number of sites @xcite , whose real part is related to the @xmath6 while the imaginary is related to the @xmath4 .",
    "we consider couplings that have correlated or uncorrelated ( for comparison ) disorder and are of a dipolar type . since the displacements of the atoms in quasi - one dimensional systems are likely to be small compared to the lattice constants , it is usually enough to consider the first order term in the expansion of @xmath9 in terms of the displacements @xcite .",
    "for the first order expanded coupling we have @xmath21 with unit lattice constant where @xmath22 is the strength of the disorder and @xmath23 is a random sign variable that is exponentially correlated @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the correlation length as a function of `` wrong sign '' concentration @xmath26 ( see below ) .",
    "thus the dipolar coupling @xmath27 has a non fluctuating part and a fluctuating part as in dirac fermions with random - varying mass @xcite .",
    "the generation of random binary sequences with correlation was deviced by implementing the convolution method of constructing a random squence .",
    "such squence can be used in various applications as in designing low - dimensional devices with desired properties @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion on this topic recently appeared @xcite .",
    "however , a more efficient and easily handled correlated sequence , related to the spin glass chain problem @xcite , can be obtained through uncorrelated random numbers as outlined below .",
    "the correlated random number at site @xmath10 follows the relation @xmath28 with the distribution ( of @xmath29 @xmath30 within @xmath31 $ ] )    @xmath32    the @xmath29 are uncorrelated between different sites and @xmath26 is the concentration of `` wrong signs '' such that @xmath33 and @xmath34 mean no disorder .",
    "clearly @xmath35 is exponentially correlated @xmath36 where one can define a correlation length @xcite @xmath37 . for the numerical computation",
    "uncorrelated @xmath29 are obtained from the uniformly distributed random number generator sequence . for the uncorrelated results we set @xmath38 at the particular concentration @xmath39 where both correlated and uncorrelated cases produce identical results since @xmath40 .",
    "it should be emphasized that while the model for uncorrelated disorder and the model for correlated disorder involve the parameter @xmath26 , in the latter model @xmath26 determines both the fraction of ` wrong sign ' bonds and the correlation length .",
    "the two models ` intersect ' at @xmath41 where there are equal numbers of @xmath42 interactions and the correlation length is @xmath43 .",
    "we have carried out extensive numerical studies to verify the equation for the correlation length given above .",
    "we note here that unlike the off - diagonal case above , many works have recently appeared on the diagonal tight binding model with correlated disorder dealing with various aspects of the problem @xcite .",
    "it was revealed that even short range correlated disorder at the band edge caused the anomalies in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "frenkel excitons in off - diagonal and diagonal models have markedly different spectra , i.e. , the former has a dysonian singularity @xcite at the band center while the latter has a power - law singularity at the band edge .",
    "hence the short - range correlations are expected to influence off - diagonal spectra more than in the diagonal case .",
    "the distribution and localization of the exciton modes are characterized by the lyapunov exponent . in the case of one - dimensional arrays with nearest - neighbor interactions ,",
    "the lyapunov exponent can be determined by making use of mode - counting techniques @xcite .",
    "recently we studied @xcite similar excitons with orientationally disordered couplings in conjugated polymers and calculated the full spectrum and optical line shapes .",
    "the goal here is to look at the effects of exponentially correlated disorder on the behavior of the @xmath4 and @xmath6 near the center of the band ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we have produced three sets of data for each case varying the correlation length i.e. , c ) and the strength of the disorder , @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "( 15,5 )    = 7.5 cm    figure  [ fig : ids0 ] displays the results of the @xmath6 and @xmath4 for exponentially correlated distributions of the couplings . for fixed @xmath22 , we divided the data produced for a particular concentration @xmath26 by a scaling factor @xmath46 ( see next section and the appendix ) .",
    "the data for selected concentrations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ids0 ] for the indicated values of @xmath22 .",
    "we expect first that for a range of concentrations the data should collapse to a dysonian singularity for fixed @xmath22",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ fig : ids0 ] reveals that as @xmath26 increases , the @xmath6 and the @xmath4 take values that differ increasingly from predictions based on ziman s analysis @xcite and a slow approach to the band center is observed . in this limit",
    ", the data clearly show qualitative scaling behavior but deviations with varying magnitude exist as @xmath47 and @xmath48 where the correlation length is infinite .",
    "notice also that the deviations are stronger for the @xmath4 than for the @xmath6 .    clearly as",
    "energy decreases , the scaling gets better ; however , the deviations become worse as one gets closer to @xmath49 . to see whether longer chains and/or lower energies improve the situation , we checked further and found that the longer chain did not improve the agreement appreciably , but as the energy is lowered , the results follow the scaling behavior more closely up to a certain limiting @xmath26 . similar disagreement between the data and the dysonian ( with a single term )",
    "singularity were encountered in the susy @xcite off - diagonal tight binding case for continuous exponential correlations .",
    "the analytical investigations @xcite revealed that the spectra for the exponential correlation can be expanded for the @xmath4 as    @xmath50    and for the inverse localization length ( @xmath6 )    @xmath51    where @xmath52 are given as of functions of the correlation length multiplied by the strength @xcite of the exponential correlations .",
    "the equations  ( [ idos])([ill ] ) are only the first order term in the expansion and @xmath53 and @xmath54 should correspond to correlated amplitude factor @xmath55 .",
    "figure  [ fig : idsf ] clearly shows the improved results obtained using the eqs .",
    "( [ idosc])([illc ] ) for the selected concentrations where the worst deviations followed from the first order result : @xmath56 .",
    "unfortunately , for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , this type of expansion appears to fail ; however , other forms of fitting with fractional powers can give better results such as tried in the susy case @xcite .",
    "we will not here discus significance of this fractional fitting since there does nt seem to be any analytic theory that predicts it .    [",
    "fig : idsf ]    ( 15,5 )    = 7.5 cm",
    "to shed some light on the scaling behavior for the correlated case , we first compute the binary uncorrelated case . a simple calculation of the logarithmic variance , the amplitude of the spectrum , for the uncorrelated case given in eqs .  ( [ idos])([ill ] ) yields the result    @xmath59    the amplitude factor for the uncorrelated disorder clearly displays a scaling behavior in concentration @xmath26 as well as in @xmath22",
    "we can identify the scaling functions for the concentration @xmath60 and the strength of the deviation @xmath61 .",

    "( [ uvar ] ) for @xmath63 .",
    "as expected , the theory for the uncorrelated case works well    the amplitude factors in fig .",
    "[ fig : scl ] ( large panel ) are found from the best fit to the dysonian singularity .",
    "they are obtained matching the smallest value of the energy rather than the value obtained by fitting over a range of energies . in this way",
    ", we will be more likely to get a value characterizing the asymptotic region . the calculated amplitude scaling function is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scl ] for the correlated case @xmath64 for the three specified @xmath22 values above . in the appendix",
    "we will argue why this formula holds .",
    "we notice immediately that the concentration dependence has a different form @xmath65 as compare to @xmath60  of the uncorrelated case while the scaling on @xmath22 is the same for both cases .",
    "this asymptotic fit can further be checked by plotting the @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the expansion above since they correspond the coefficient of the dysonian singularity .",
    "the bottom inset displays the @xmath53 and @xmath54 obtained by the best fit as compare to the theoretical line @xmath55 ( for @xmath67 ) .",
    "both plots clearly support the asymptotic amplitude scaling .",
    "[ fig : scl ]    ( 15,5 )    = 7.5 cm    although the results obtained by asymptotic fit are clearly reproduced by the theoretical amplitude factor , there are striking differences between correlated and uncorrelated cases .",
    "what is particularly interesting and not expected is that the results for correlated disorder is not symmetric about @xmath39 like those of the uncorrelated case .",
    "also , from our scaling analysis the @xmath6 coefficient becomes large as @xmath47 , but vanishes as @xmath48 .",
    "this is surprising since the modes for @xmath34 are extended just like the modes for @xmath33 .",
    "the divergence of the amplitude factor as @xmath68 is not inconsistent with the results for @xmath34 since the energy interval over which scaling holds shrinks to zero in the same limit .",
    "this can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ idos])([ill ] ) by setting either the @xmath4 or the @xmath6 to a constant value and solving for the cut - off energy as as a function of @xmath26 . as shown in the appendix ,",
    "the amplitude factors perform a correlated random walk in parameter space . for our case ,",
    "the square of the length of the random walk is proportional to @xmath69 not @xmath20 alone as in the uncorrelated case . that is the source of the marked difference between the two cases . as the concentration approaches @xmath70 ,",
    "divergent behavior occurs .",
    "however , we note that we can not take c arbitrarily close to @xmath70 ; beyond a certain point , the random walk sequence can not be constructed @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of 1d frenkel exciton systems with correlated off - diagonal disorder . we have used a negative eigenvalue counting technique @xcite which provides a simple and physically transparent analysis of the @xmath4 and the @xmath6 .",
    "we investigated the question of scaling when there was correlated off - diagonal disorder such as might occur , for example , when the off - diagonal interaction depended on the distance between two ions and thus would be affected by small displacements of the ions from their equilibrium positions @xcite .",
    "our numerical data indicate that in the correlated case the scaling behavior found by ziman @xcite is followed only for a limited range of @xmath26 and very small @xmath3 .",
    "we compared our results with the scaling predictions of ziman @xcite and with the similar tight binding correlated electronic case @xcite .",
    "we computed the asymptotic amplitude factors as a function of concentration and found that they are equal to the uncorrelated variance at @xmath39 multiplied by the factor @xmath71 ( see appendix ) .",
    "this factor @xcite has played a very interesting scaling role in number of unrelated problems .",
    "we found that with the new variance for correlated distributions rather unexpected behavior was obtained as compare to that of the uncorrelated case .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic amplitude factor is not symmetric about @xmath39 while the @xmath6 diverges for concentrations approaching @xmath70 in contrast to what is observed in the uncorrelated case .",
    "this amplitude factor can explain only the first order expansion in a dyson - type singularity as supported by the susy model @xcite . as shown in the appendix , if the random walk observation of eggarter _ _ et__@xmath72_al .",
    "is _ implemented , with correlation , the obtained amplitude factor can reproduce the data within a shrinking energy range as @xmath73 as @xmath26 is increased .",
    "finally , we should emphasize that our work is a numerical study supplemented by the approximate theoretical analysis outlined in the appendix . as mentioned previously",
    ", the surprising result is the discovery that near the center of the exciton band , a model with correlated disorder showed asymptotic behavior that is similar to the behavior of systems without correlations , the only difference being in the amplitude factor appearing in the limiting expressions for the idos and ill . like those of essentially all numerical studies , our results are approximate .",
    "we hope that the availability of the numerical findings together with our analytical results will stimulate rigorous analyses of the model that may shed light on the origin of the similarity .",
    "this work is partially sponsored by the scientific and technical research council of turkey ( tubitak ) and ege university research grant ( bap ) .",
    "in this section we present the amplitude scaling related to the first order expansion coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 in eqs .",

    "( [ tb ] ) is responsible for the logarithmic variance as rigorously shown in @xcite and eventually the dyson- type singularity @xcite since @xmath75 executes a random walk with a step @xmath76 . for the uncorrelated case the averages yield @xmath77 and @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xcite takes this form @xmath79 .",
    "the imaginary part here @xmath80 and the real part is related to the @xmath6 . to make our point , we can attack the problem with a different angle . the average of the summation @xmath81 for both correlated and uncorrelated cases ; whereas , the average of the squared summation @xmath82 .",
    "it further reduces to @xmath83 since the second sum is zero for the independent random numbers but non zero for the correlated random numbers . for the correlated disorder",
    "the summation is not easy .",
    "the complication arises when correlation present since @xmath84 is not equal to its ensemble average rather it dependents on @xmath10 . but this complication can be avoided in a following way .",
    "let us calculate  the taylor expansion of @xmath85 which reads @xmath86        the first sum ( with odd powers of a ) is just the expansion of @xmath90 and let the second sum ( with even powers ) be @xmath91 which will be eliminated when it is inserted in @xmath92 .",

    "the nearest distance between the atoms is @xmath107 and @xmath10 is the site index .",
    "since the interaction decreases rapidly over the @xmath10 to @xmath108 distance , regarding nearest - neighbor couplings is sufficient as a first approximation .",
    "assuming unit neighbor distance the tranfer integral reduces to @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the strength and @xmath111 is the random sign of the deviation from the regular lattice point .",
    "notice that @xmath112 is used in the text as @xmath113 .",
    "the deviations from the equilibrium positions introduces a correlation .",
    "if @xmath110 is small , one can expand the coupling as @xmath114 . since b is a free parameter , one can replace 3b with a without loss of generality .",
    "note that using the approximate form in place of the cubic form does not make an essential change in the spectra apart from a numerical factor since the spectra are related to averages of the logarithm , @xmath115 and our numerical study confirmed this ."
