    "the attention drawn to e+a galaxies ( or post - starbursts ) has increased since it was claimed that their fraction observed in clusters is correlated with the butcher - oemler effect @xcite .",
    "the e+a galaxies present a peculiar spectrum in the optical : strong balmer absorption lines , representative of a large population of a and b stars , but a _ lack _ of emission lines typical of blue , star forming galaxies , like [ oii]@xmath9 , [ oiii]@xmath105007 , and h@xmath11 . because of the further detection of metallic absorption lines such as mg b @xmath12 , ca h & k @xmath13 , 3968 and fe @xmath14 , indicative of an old population dominated by g , k and m spectral types they were called e+a @xcite . in addition , their spectra in the _ optical _ can not be reproduced simply by a young stellar component without nebular emission lines : it is necessary to add an old population of stars , like the one present in quiescent elliptical galaxies @xcite .    during the last 3 years ,",
    "research on the e+a galaxies has seen a revival after the discovery of more such galaxies not only in nearby clusters , like coma and others ( e.g. see @xcite and references therein ) , but also in the field ; in particular those discovered during the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs , shectman 1996 ) by @xcite .",
    "an interesting feature is the apparent existence of two classes of e+a galaxies @xcite .",
    "one is formed by `` blue '' post - starburst galaxies and the other by redder , h@xmath15-strong ( hds ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "these subclasses of e+as have colors and absorption line features related to the morphology : hds e+as have in general a noticeable bulge and/or spheroidal component when compared with the blue class .",
    "in addition , the hds class can be divided into 2 subclasses : bulge and disk hdss ( as observed in a665 and in coma @xcite ) .",
    "an almost unexplored domain of these e+a galaxies is their near - ir properties .",
    "in fact , no catalogue or systematic observations exist on this subject .",
    "is the bright , red population , dominated mainly by giants and stars of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) of the e+as , different from the red population of other elliptical galaxies , in particular the perturbed ellipticals ?",
    "is there any conspicuous signature in the near - ir colors of the e+a galaxies , as in the optical wavelengths ?",
    "do the cluster e+a galaxies have bluer colors than those in the field at these wavelengths ? are the near - ir colors of the e+a galaxies similar to the colors of normal galaxies , as predicted by spectrophotometric models ?    in this paper , we investigate these questions with new data taken at las campanas observatory , in chile .",
    "the sample includes e+a galaxies from the field ( most of them from the lcrs ) and from nearby clusters as well as clusters at @xmath1 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we present the galaxies selected for this work . in ",
    "3 we explain the observations , and in  4 the data reduction procedures . in  5 we present the results of the photometry , the apparent magnitudes , colors , and k - corrections .",
    "both , _ observed _ and _ rest - frame _ colors are compared with colors obtained from spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution in  6 . in  7 we discuss the limitations of our results and the implications for some properties of the e+a galaxies from our near - ir colors .",
    "conclusions are presented in  8 .",
    "all of the galaxies selected for this study have been spectroscopically classified as e+a galaxies from the analysis of their balmer absorption lines ( particularly the equivalent widths of h@xmath15 and h@xmath16 ) and the lack of nebular emission lines , representative of an ongoing stellar formation process .",
    "we have selected most of the southern e+a galaxies existent in the literature at present .",
    "the sample of galaxies is divided into 4 subsamples .",
    "the first subsample corresponds to 21 field e+a galaxies from the lcrs selected from a catalogue of @xmath17 galaxies with redshift between @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the second subsample contains 22 e+as from the nearby clusters dc2048 - 52 , dc1842 - 63 , dc0329 - 52 , and dc0107 - 46 @xcite at @xmath0 .",
    "seven e+a galaxies from rich clusters at @xmath20 ( ac103 and ac114 ) constitute the 3rd subsample @xcite .",
    "some `` control '' galaxies were observed also ( the 4th subsample , 13 galaxies ) .",
    "these galaxies have well - known properties and provide a reference sample to compare the observables of the e+a sample .",
    "the control sample includes mostly elliptical and lenticular galaxies ( from clusters and the field ) , as well as a few galaxies between @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "table [ samples ] summarizes the sample of 63 galaxies which have been observed .",
    "all of the observations presented here were carried out at las campanas observatory , chile , during photometric conditions .",
    "most of the images were obtained with the 40-inch swope telescope , using a nicmos3 hgcdte array ( 256 @xmath23 256 pixels , 0.599 arcsec / pix , @xmath24 arcmin fov ) , in march , july , august and november 1998 .",
    "we employed also the 100-inch du pont telescope in september 1998 , with a nicmos3 detector , yielding a scale of 0.42 arcsec / pix ( @xmath25 arcmin fov ) .",
    "we use the following filters : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath26 short ( @xmath5 ) , centered at 1.24@xmath27 , 1.65@xmath27 , and 2.16@xmath27 , respectively , and bandwidths of 0.22@xmath27 , 0.30@xmath27 , and 0.33@xmath27 . for",
    "a detailed discussion of the photometric system see @xcite .",
    "between 5 and 8 standard stars from @xcite were observed each night . the observation procedure for all the objects ( standards included ) was as follows .",
    "each object was observed at several positions on the array , some amount of time in each position ( i call this an _ observing sequence _ for a given object in a given filter ) .",
    "the amount of time depended on the magnitude of the object , on the sky brightness , and on the linearity regime of the array .",
    "the nicmos3 becomes noticeably non - linear when the total counts ( sky + object ) exceed 17000 adu .",
    "we exposed in each position between 60 and 120 seconds in @xmath3 , between 30 and 60 seconds in @xmath4 , and between 30 and 50 seconds in @xmath5 .",
    "total exposure times for a given observing sequence and filter varied between 10 and 45 minutes . for the standard stars ( with magnitudes between @xmath28 ) , the exposure time ranged between 5 and 20 seconds in each position , for both telescopes .",
    "typically , the number of non - redundant positions at which each object was observed varied between 4 and 10 , depending on the size and/or magnitude of the object .",
    "a pre - reduction was made at the beginning of each observing sequence in order to estimate the total exposure time required to reach a minimum central s / n @xmath29 .",
    "this pre - reduction consisted in the construction of a sky image averaging all of the stacked images for a given object ( with a sigma - clipping rejection threshold ) , the subtraction of the sky image from each individual image , and the combination after registration of the individual sky - subtracted images .",
    "the images have to be corrected for all of the instrumental effects , namely , non - linear deviations , dark - current contribution ( dark subtraction ) , and pixel - to - pixel response differences ( flat - field division ) .    for the determination of the linearity corrections ,",
    "we take several dome - flats with different exposure time .",
    "then , we plot the ratio of the average counts and the integration time of each frame , as a function of the average counts . after normalizing ,",
    "we transform the count value i@xmath30 of each pixel into i@xmath31 = i@xmath30 [ 1 + c@xmath23i@xmath30 ] , and we solve for the _ constant _ c which proved to vary between @xmath33 and @xmath34 . at 14000 counts , for example , which corresponds to @xmath35 of the whole range of the signal ,",
    "the departure from linearity is only 2% .    at the beginning of the night",
    "we took series of 20 dark frames , the number of series depending on the number of different exposure times we used through the night .",
    "the flat - field images were constructed from ( a ) dome - flats and twilight sky - flats and ( b ) the raw science images of the night , which allowed us to construct _ super - flats _ from the combination of the individual frames .",
    "the useful images for these super - flats were those where the objects were faint and/or a small number of objects were observed .",
    "because galaxy fields were in general uncrowded , it was always possible to construct super - flats .",
    "typically , each super - flat was constructed from no less than 30 science images , for each filter .",
    "the results show that the super - flats allow to correct for fringes appearing in the stacked and combined images .",
    "the fringes are present in the 3 filters ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , but are particularly prominent in the h images . except for the presence of fringes ,",
    "the dome- and sky - flats are quite similar to the super - flats ( at the 0.6% level ) .",
    "however , given the better photon statistics of the super - flats and the fact that the fringes are better represented by the super - flats we chose the super - flats to remove the pixel - to - pixel variations . from the object frames , the dark and flat - fielding corrections were made on the images using the sqiid reduction package , implemented under iraf . at this stage , a mask with the bad pixels was created ( using the dark images ) to correct those pixels by interpolation with their neighbor pixels in all the images .    once the linearity corrections were done , as well as the dark correction and flat - fielding procedures in all the raw images , the procedure to obtain stacked and combined sky - subtracted images began .",
    "this part was done using dimsum , also implemented under iraf",
    ". the general procedure for a given _ observing sequence _ follows .    1 .",
    "a scaling factor for each image was computed using a 5@xmath36 iterated rejection method about the mean .",
    "the scaling factor is the median of the unrejected pixels , and is stored as a descriptor in the image header .",
    "this provides a first estimate for the sky level .",
    "2 .   for each image in the observing sequence , a specified number of neighboring images of the sequence were selected . to construct a sky image",
    ", we selected only the neighboring images taken within @xmath37 min from the given image .",
    "this provides a sample of sky images within a short - period of time during which the variations of the sky level are not larger than 1% to 3% of the mean , in order to reduce the r.m.s .",
    "variation in the thermal emission background as well as the oh sky lines , characteristic of the nir ( see figure [ sky ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the higher background in @xmath5 produces higher shot noise even if this background did not vary with time .",
    "this is a key step . at each pixel",
    "a specified number of low and high values in the scaled images were rejected and the average of the remainder values was taken as the sky for that pixel . the resulting sky image was subtracted from the object image to create a sky subtracted object image .",
    "cosmic rays were found using a threshold algorithm applied to the ratio of the image and a median filtered image .",
    "the detected cosmic rays were replaced by the local median .",
    "a cosmic ray mask was created to record the location of the cosmic rays .",
    "4 .   for a given observing sequence ,",
    "a shift list is created to define the offsets between the images . to create this list",
    "it is first necessary to have at least one object in common among all of the images of the observing sequence ( usually a star ) . next we selected a set of additional objects to improve the determination of the relative shifts .",
    "these objects were used in constructing the shift list using a centroid - based algorithm .",
    "a registration stage was done by shifting and combining the images of the sequence .",
    "a matching exposure map was also created , which allows to obtain a final mosaic properly weighted by the effective exposure time of each section of the mosaic .",
    "6 .   to provide combined images free of `` holes '' arising from the sky subtraction ,",
    "two different masks are created for each registered image of the observing sequence .",
    "the detailed procedure is explained in the dimsum package .",
    "the sky subtraction is repeated as in the first pass , before the masking procedure , except that the pixels in the individual masks derived from ( f ) are ignored .",
    "finally , all the sky - subtracted images of an observing sequence are shifted and combined , and the different parts of the mosaic are scaled to an exposure time of 1 s.",
    "the photometric calibrations were done using the faint standard stars from the list of @xcite .",
    "this list includes standard magnitudes in @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath26 and @xmath5 for equatorial and southern photometric standard stars .",
    "five to eight standards were observed every night at airmasses similar to those of the galaxies ( no larger than 1.2 ) .",
    "this minimizes the dimming and reddening due to the airmass contribution , especially in colors involving the @xmath3 filter .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were computed using the code sextractor @xcite , which computes isophotal , isophotal corrected , and total magnitudes for all the objects detected above a given threshold .",
    "we have also computed instrumental aperture magnitudes using daophot , and verified that daophot aperture magnitudes for the standards do not differ by more than @xmath38 from the total magnitudes yielded by sextractor .",
    "the aperture used for the standards in daophot is the maximum aperture after analyzing the shape of the grow curve for the instrumental magnitudes , and typically take radii values @xmath39 arcsec .",
    "we conclude that the instrumental magnitudes given by sextractor are reliable , which we adopt hereafter .",
    "the adopted photometric transformations between the instrumental and the calibrated magnitudes are : @xmath40 where the @xmath41 coefficients ( @xmath42 = 1 , 2 , 3 ) are the zero points , @xmath43 is the airmass , and the extinction coefficients are from @xcite . note that we do not try to solve for airmass corrections night by night , as this can lead to spurious values for coefficients if the extinction is variable and non - gray .",
    "the latter is relevant at the filter passband edges where water vapor influences the effective width of the passband @xcite .",
    "the zero points @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 were determined on a nightly basis , and proved to vary between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we do not include color terms in these transformations ( equations 1 , 2 , and 3 ) since they are smaller than 0.04 mag , a value close to the observational magnitude errors .",
    "we emphasize that all of the standards and the galaxies reported in this paper were observed during completely photometric nights .",
    "the photometric transformations have typical r.m.s .",
    "residuals of @xmath49 mag on both telescopes ( see figure [ stds_error ] ) .",
    "this gives an internal error in the photometric calibrations around 2% to 5% .",
    "the main source of error are , in fact , the short - term sky fluctuations ( in particular in @xmath5 ) , which are of the order of 3% to 6% in time intervals spanning the longest exposure time of individual frames during each of the observing sequences ( 120 s in @xmath3 , 60 s in @xmath4 , and 50 s in @xmath5 ) .",
    "some galaxies were observed twice , even using the two telescopes , and therefore there is a good estimate of the global photometric errors , which proves to be around 7% for photometric nights .",
    "the observation of the same object during two photometric nights but with different telescope / instrument is the best way to estimate the photometric quality of the data ( see  5.2 ) , and the real dispersion of magnitudes .",
    "instrumental apparent magnitudes for all the galaxies were obtained on the registered and combined images using the code sextractor @xcite .",
    "given the differences in size , shape and luminosity of the galaxies , the total magnitude is a better estimator than the aperture or isophotal magnitudes .",
    "sextractor computes aperture magnitudes , isophotal magnitudes and `` total '' magnitudes for all of the objects detected above a given threshold .",
    "the total apparent instrumental magnitude for a given object is given by one of the two following approaches .",
    "( 1 ) it is computed using an _ adaptive _ aperture magnitude or ( 2 ) , using a _ corrected _ isophotal magnitude . in order to give the best estimate of the total magnitude",
    ", the adaptive aperture method is performed , except if a neighbor is suspected to bias the magnitude by more than 0.1 mag .",
    "if this happens , the corrected isophotal magnitude is taken as the total magnitude .",
    "this leads to the so - called mag_best magnitude , in the sextractor output catalogue .    in order to check the calibrated magnitudes for our galaxies , and to have an idea of the accuracy of our total magnitudes , we observed some of the galaxies on two different nights , with the 40-inch and the 100-inch telescopes .",
    "for the 8 galaxies which were observed twice ( 2 for each subsample ) , we found r.m.s differences @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . these differences ,",
    "although large when taken at face value , represent the most realistic errors in the total magnitudes , since they were obtained with different instrumental set - ups during different observing runs .",
    "once the instrumental magnitudes are calculated using sextractor , they are transformed to the standard system using the package photcal in iraf .",
    "table [ all_calib ] shows the apparent calibrated total magnitudes for all of the galaxies of the 4 subsamples .",
    "the @xmath5 magnitude for galaxy # 25 , ac114_89 , was not computed since it was observed under possibly non - photometric conditions , and was marked with a nc ( not calibrated ) . no internal reddening correction was applied to these magnitudes , nor a galactic foreground extinction correction : both corrections are smaller than the photometric error and , in particular , are smaller than the uncertainty given by the k - correction , as we show in  5.6 .",
    "the reddening by dust is @xmath53 and @xmath54 , if we consider a simple screen model based on the reddening law of @xcite .",
    "if we consider a more complicated extinction model , following the star - dust mixture recipe by @xcite , the amount of reddening is similar .",
    "the correction due to galactic extinction is also small for the 3 passbands ( @xmath55 ) , which proves to be well within the photometric uncertainties ( for the galactic reddening corrections in the near - ir photometric bands see @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize , however , that galactic and internal reddening corrections are systematic effects , while the photometric uncertainty is random .",
    "given their small values , no attempt is made to correct for the extinctions . if we include foreground and internal extinction , the @xmath56 color redden probably no more than 0.03  0.05 ( but see discussion at the end of  6 ) .    since the k - terms can significantly modify the intrinsic colors of the galaxies , they are critical in correcting the observed colors and magnitudes to the galaxy rest - frame . if @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the apparent magnitudes in the passbands 1 and 2 , respectively , for a galaxy at a redshift @xmath59 and with a known spectral type @xmath60 , then the rest - frame color for this galaxy is @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the corresponding absolute magnitudes , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the k - corrections for the passband 1 and 2 , respectively , for the galaxy with spectral type @xmath60 at redshift @xmath59 .",
    "k - corrections are not included in the magnitudes and colors presented in table [ all_calib ] since they can have a wide range of values depending on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) employed in their computation .",
    "when the sed is not available for a given object , it is common practice ( although risky ) to adopt k - terms from the correlation between spectral type and morphological classification , provided the latter is available .    in our case , we only have approximate morphological types for the e+as from the literature , nor do we have spectral information for the galaxies in the near - infrared part of the spectra .",
    "even though most of our e+a galaxies are early types , we can ask the following .",
    "how will the near - ir k - corrections depend on the spectrophotometric model of galaxy evolution used to compute them ? in order to study the model dependence in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath26 , take for example 2 sed models which provide ( or allow us to compute ) k - terms in the near - ir .",
    "the first k - terms were taken directly from @xcite , who computed k - corrections from the near - uv to the infrared .",
    "@xcite provides k - corrections in several bands in the johnson - bessel & brett photometric system , up to @xmath66 as a function of morphological type .",
    "the values are computed according to an evolutionary synthesis model that reproduces the integrated galaxy spectrum in the range 1000 - 25000  , and uses the code of gissel93 @xcite .",
    "the models are instantaneous bursts with solar metallicity and scalo imf @xcite .",
    "the age after the burst gives the sed which is compared with galaxies of known morphological type through colors .",
    "note that the comparison is done in the optical part of the spectrum , mostly between 3000 and 8000  .",
    "the second set of k - corrections were derived using the model pegase @xcite to generate synthetic spectra between 7000    and 30000  , and convolving these seds with the filter response functions ( see persson 1998 ) , using the definition of the k - correction @xcite .",
    "figure [ k_poggianti ] shows the k - corrections in @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath26 , calculated by @xcite for 3 different morphological types , namely , e ( solid line ) , sa ( dotted line ) and sc ( dashed line ) .",
    "note that the k - corrections in the near - ir are not necessarily small .",
    "nevertheless , in most of the photometric bands they do not depend strongly on the spectral type or the morphological type .",
    "k - corrections are large ( and negative ) for the @xmath26 band , for @xmath67 , for all galaxy types ( this makes galaxies to appear brighter than they really are ) .",
    "the average redshift in our sample is @xmath68 0.08 , and k - corrections in all the bands are less than 0.1 mag for most of the cases .",
    "the exceptions are the e+a galaxies in ac103 and ac104 ( at @xmath1 ) . for these objects",
    "k - corrections can be larger and around @xmath69 mag in @xmath26 for the late type galaxies .",
    "figure [ k_pegase ] shows the k - term calculated from pegase .",
    "these k - corrections are calculated from seds with solar metallicity and also instantaneous bursts .",
    "the imf is from @xcite . in pegase ,",
    "the authors define their morphological types by directly comparing spectra generated from their models with @xcite optical spectra of nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , matches colors obtained from her model with observed colors of galaxies , taken from @xcite and @xcite .    comparing figure [ k_poggianti ] and [ k_pegase ] ,",
    "we conclude that although the k - corrections are quite different from one model to another , they are similar for @xmath6 . for @xmath70 , differences are larger .",
    "k - corrections for different hubble types are more similar if they are derived from pegase than from the models of poggianti .",
    "figure [ k_diff ] shows the differences between these k - corrections for the two models , in the 3 passbands , and for the 3 hubble types . up to @xmath71",
    "the difference for the e type in @xmath3 and @xmath4 is less than 0.05 mag .",
    "however , the difference is @xmath72 mag for the later types .",
    "equation ( [ rest_col ] ) implies that the differences in @xmath56 will be less than 0.05 mag .",
    "however , this is not the case for colors involving the @xmath26 band ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , due to the large difference in the k - corrections , for all the hubble types , as shown also in figure [ k_diff ] .",
    "the difference in @xmath26 for the k - corrections reaches values @xmath75 mag at @xmath1 .",
    "this shows that k - correction uncertainty will have the largest impact on rest - frame colors .",
    "other studies also show large differences between their k - corrections , although some of them are comparable to the values of this work , showing also large negative k - corrections in @xmath26 @xcite . for example , @xcite obtains type - averaged k - corrections in @xmath26 , reaching @xmath76 and @xmath77 at @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "these values are larger than values from @xcite , but similar to those obtained from pegase ( see figure [ k_poggianti ] and [ k_pegase ] ) .",
    "as shown in the preceding section , k - corrections in the near - ir can be very different depending on the spectrophotometric models used .",
    "therefore , we do not use rest - frame colors , i.e. we do not de - redshift the data .",
    "instead , we _",
    "redshift _ current epoch seds .",
    "although this approach is similar to work with rest - frame colors , it is more robust , since the seds of the current epoch models can be determined absolutely . in order to give an idea whether synthetic seds compare well with spectra of galaxies at the current epoch",
    ", we consider gissel96 models @xcite and compare them with real , local galaxy spectra of known morphological types , given by @xcite .",
    "as it is well - known , the age - metallicity degeneracy prevents us for deriving age and metallicity directly from colors , as was shown by @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider instantaneous bursts of fixed ( solar ) metallicity .",
    "subsequent evolution is determined by adopting passive stellar evolution , measured in gyrs and indicated by the label `` age '' for each model spectrum in figure [ spectra ] .",
    "a simple @xmath80 test is used to determine the model spectra closest to the observed ( kennicutt ) sample .",
    "we use a starting sample of 20 gissel96 spectra and 27 spectra representative of normal galaxies of known hubble types @xcite .",
    "figure [ spectra ] shows the better spectral match between some kennicutt spectra and the 20 selected gissel96 models .",
    "the hubble sequence fits well with an evolutionary sequence in the optical , but care has to be taken in the interpretation since more than one solution can be obtained from a synthetic set where both age and metallicity vary @xcite . even though metallicity can vary from one galaxy to another",
    ", it is realistic to set metallicity close to solar .",
    "extremely metal - poor ( z @xmath81 z@xmath82 ) or metal - rich ( z @xmath83 z@xmath82 ) cases are unlikely in this set of galaxies @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fact that colors are obtained from _ integrated _ total apparent magnitudes , imply that colors are an average over the whole galaxy light and therefore likely to be representative of solar metallicity or lower in the luminosity weighted mean ( see for example @xcite ) .    in order to compare the observed colors with models ,",
    "we take the 20 spectra from gissel96 and we `` redshift '' them to several redshift values ( from the rest - frame to @xmath84 ) . afterwards , we compute synthetic colors using @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 passbands @xcite for the 20 synthetic spectra . figure [ obs_colors ] shows the color - color diagram for the e+a sample and the control sample ( indicated as filled circles ) , as well as for the model spectra ( indicated as open symbols ) situated at different redshifts ( as indicated by labels ) .",
    "we include 3 different evolving tracks in figure [ obs_colors ] , for instantaneous bursts after 1 gyr , 3 gyr and 16 gyr indicated by circles , squares , and triangles , respectively .",
    "after 10 gyr , the near - ir colors are almost independent of age , for a given redshift .",
    "figure [ obs_colors ] shows that there is an overall agreement between near - ir colors of all subsamples and models , except for subsample 3 .",
    "the average color @xmath85 @xmath86 of subsample 1 ( average redshift @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) agrees well with any model older than 3 gyr at @xmath89 .",
    "however , the average @xmath90 @xmath91 appears bluer than the same models by @xmath92 mag .",
    "otherwise , @xmath93 is well fitted by a model with age @xmath94 gyr at @xmath89 , but then @xmath95 of subsample 1 is redder by @xmath92 mag .",
    "these differences are twice the color dispersion for this subsample",
    ". therefore we can conclude that colors of the models and the data do not differ by more than @xmath96 . in subsample 2 ,",
    "the average colors @xmath97 @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath86 , with average redshift @xmath100 @xmath101 , are well fitted by a model at @xmath102 and 2.8 gyr .",
    "subsample 3 , having @xmath103 @xmath104 , @xmath105 @xmath106 , and average redshift @xmath107 @xmath108 is not fitted by the gissel96 models , even though the average color @xmath95 is closer to the @xmath109 redshifted color of models .",
    "subsample 4 ( the control sample ) matches the models colors well , despite the rather large scatter .",
    "this subsample has average colors @xmath97 @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and average redshift @xmath112 @xmath113 .",

    "most of these galaxies are nearby galaxies ( from the pgc and ngc catalogues ) and some galaxies from dc clusters @xcite .",
    "all have secure hubble types , and most of them have known photometric properties in the optical ( for @xmath114 and @xmath115 total magnitudes see table [ all_calib ] ) .",
    "the majority of these galaxies are well matched by the colors provided by the spectrophotometric models , for ages representative of early type galaxies .",
    "these galaxies have large apparent radii , and therefore , their photometry is more sensitive to color gradients .",
    "this is not a problem for more distant galaxies because of the poorer spatial resolution .",
    "now we compare color properties of subsample 1 ( field e+as from the lcrs ) and 2 ( cluster e+as ) . from figure",
    "[ obs_colors ] it is apparent that subsample 1 has the same average @xmath93 ( with a difference of 0.03 ) , but a redder @xmath95 than subsample 2 ( see above ) .",
    "the difference of 0.12 mag is @xmath116 and @xmath117 away from the intrinsic dispersion of subsample 1 and subsample 2 , respectively .",
    "the expected color difference due to k - corrections between @xmath87 ( subsample 1 ) and @xmath100 ( subsample 2 ) is @xmath118 mag , for a 2 gyr model ( half of the 0.12 color difference between the two subsamples ) , which fits the average colors of both subsamples 1 and 2 better . therefore , we can only conclude with a @xmath119 confidence level that e+a galaxies from the field are redder than cluster e+as .",
    "the fact that dust extinction is much more notorious in @xmath56 than in @xmath120 suggest that the color difference observed in @xmath120 between subsample 1 and subsample 2 is not due to differential internal dust extinction .",
    "however , because of the observed color dispersion , we can not give a robust answer supporting stellar population differences instead of internal reddening differences due to extinction .",
    "we stress that our differences are only at @xmath121 significance level .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath56 color would _ redden systematically _",
    "@xmath122 if we account for foreground or internal extinction ( see  5.3 )",
    ". this would make ages inferred from colors ( see figure [ obs_colors ] ) slightly older ( 0.5 to 1 gyr ) , but in any case alter the results of the analysis , since changes are the same for all the galaxy samples .",
    "in order to interpret correctly the color properties of the observed galaxy sample , it is important to keep in mind the sources of uncertainty which affect the colors .",
    "the first source of uncertainty is of course the data acquisition itself .",
    "given the nature of the near - ir imaging , the thermal variation of the sky affects the photometry for the faint objects , which require longer integration time than the brighter ones , sometimes much longer than the typical time of the sky fluctuations ( see figure [ sky ] ) .",
    "however , the nature of these variations is well understood and the fact that the sky fluctuations are sampled in _ real - time _ and subtracted for each image can reduce this error to 5% ( see  3 ) .",
    "the second important source of errors is the procedure employed to compute the magnitude .",
    "it is well known that total magnitudes depend on the cut level where the light contribution is null or not significant . in our case ,",
    "sextractor computes total magnitudes integrating all the light up to a given threshold above the sky ( typically 1.5@xmath36 ) , and fitting elliptical isophotes to the profiles .",
    "an elliptical aperture for a given galaxy , defined by the elongation @xmath123 and position angle @xmath124 , is computed from the 2nd order moment in the light distribution , above the isophotal threshold .",
    "the `` first moment '' @xmath125 is then computed is defined as @xmath126 . ] within an aperture twice as large as the isophotal aperture , in order to reach the light distribution in the wings .",
    "this approach is very similar to the approach of @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath125 is then used to define the adaptive aperture where the total magnitude will be computed .",
    "the main axes of the ellipse are defined as @xmath127 and @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is a value to be fixed by the user .",
    "we carried out some tests with both faint and bright galaxies and found that the value @xmath130 allows us to include between @xmath131 and @xmath132 of the total flux without introducing additional noise within the aperture .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "this procedure ensures that not more than 5% of the light is lost .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the photometric errors due to the transformation of the instrumental magnitudes to calibrated magnitudes . this process is well understood and in general the scatter is small .",
    "the errors of the zero points are @xmath133 to @xmath134 .    the largest uncertainties ( now for rest - frame colors ) are due to the k - corrections",
    ". these uncertainties , as shown in the previous section , can be very large for galaxies with @xmath135 , where the change in magnitude produced by the computation of k - corrections assuming one or another sed can reach differences as large as 30% , propagating these differences to the rest - frame colors ( see figure [ k_diff ] ) . for galaxies with @xmath136 ,",
    "differences are smaller : @xmath137 for @xmath138 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 . in order to compute reliable k - corrections ,",
    "it is fundamental to obtain calibrated spectra at 9000 @xmath141 25000    for different spectral types , including e+a galaxies .",
    "of course , the nature of the uncertainties lies in the fact that k - corrections are expressed in term of the morphological type instead of the spectral type .",
    "the morphological type relies on a subjective classification procedure , often dependent on the passband through which the images are obtained ( more or less sensitive to the star population which delineates the galaxy morphology ) and is always strongly dependent on the image quality . on the other hand",
    ", there is no unique and reliable relationship between the spectral type and the morphological type of the galaxies . even though this is approximately true for normal hubble types @xcite",
    ", the dispersion can be large for some spectral types or active galaxies @xcite , leading to large uncertainties in the k - correction = @xmath142 , t - type ) .",
    "however , we note that independently of what spectrophotometric models are used in obtaining rest - frame colors , the k - corrections in @xmath26 ( or @xmath5 band ) , are only _ weakly _ dependent on the spectral type for @xmath136 ( see figures [ k_poggianti ] , [ k_pegase ] , and [ k_diff ] ) .",
    "we now examine some color properties of the e+a galaxies observed in the near - ir , keeping in mind the limitations of the accuracy of our photometry , as discussed above .",
    "studying the position of the e+a galaxies in the @xmath120/@xmath56 plane shown in figure [ obs_colors ] , we see that _ field _ galaxies located at @xmath143 ( subsample 1 ) , have an average @xmath56 color similar to that of e+a galaxies located in nearby clusters ( @xmath144 , subsample 2 ) , but are slightly _ redder _ in the average @xmath120 color ( see preceding section ) .",
    "the fact that the color difference of 0.12 mag in only significant at @xmath119 level prevents us from proposing a robust conclusion .",
    "however , we can now ask how the k - corrections can change this result . here",
    "we examine the answer to this question using the two sets of k - corrections show in  5.3 the pegase and the poggianti k - corrections .",
    "figure [ color_average ] shows average rest - frame colors for our sample of galaxies computed using both sets of k - corrections .",
    "also shown are the colors of the sample of elliptical galaxies from @xcite .",
    "we show the average colors for the _ cluster _ and the _ field _ galaxies separately .",
    "this figure demonstrates that , although the color differences are small , the same trend is observed , independently of which set of k - corrections is used .",
    "the color difference in @xmath95 between field and cluster e+as is about 0.04 mag using pegase k - corrections and 0.15 mag using poggianti k - corrections .",
    "note that in figure [ color_average ] we compare cluster - field colors also for the lcrs sample ( 3 lcrs e+as belong to clusters ) .",
    "the field e+as from lcrs are also redder in @xmath95 than the lcrs cluster e+as .    as demonstrated by @xcite , stellar populations containing a large fraction of agb stars ( 1 to 3 gyr old ) , have redder @xmath74 color ( but similar @xmath56 index ) , compared with populations that lack such stars .",
    "this might suggest that the e+a galaxies in the field have a larger fractions of agb stars than those in clusters .",
    "we emphasize that , although the difference given by the k - correction between @xmath2 and @xmath0 for subsamples 1 and 2 , respectively , does change the corresponding average colors , the observed color trend field / cluster does not change .",
    "note that three out 21 lcrs e+as are embedded in clusters ( lcrs # 4 , 11 and 20 , these galaxies have an average color @xmath145 , using the pegase k - corrections , and @xmath146 , using the poggianti k - corrections .",
    "these values are @xmath147 and @xmath148 bluer , respectively , than the average @xmath120 color for the lcrs e+a galaxies located in the field , and are consistent with the comparison field / cluster between subsamples 1 and 2 .",
    "galaxies in more distant clusters ( subsample 3 ) , appear redder in @xmath56 ( at 2@xmath36 significance level ) than those at lower redshift ( compared with both subsamples 1 and 2 ) . as discussed above ,",
    "although for this subsample k - corrections are critical , the @xmath56 color does not change if one uses a different set of k - corrections .",
    "this could be interpreted as a temperature change of the first - ascent giant branch ( fagb ) in the stellar populations of these @xmath1 e+a galaxies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a further spectroscopic analysis in the near - ir would settle this question , and also will help to disentangle possible significant extinction in the @xmath3 band .",
    "one can also compare the integrated rest - frame colors between the e+a galaxies from subsample 2 with the control galaxies which _ also _ belong to these nearby clusters ( e.g. galaxies # 52 , 53 , 59 , 60 and 61 in table [ all_calib ] .",
    "we note that the average @xmath120 color for both sets of galaxies is similar , and therefore any difference ( in the mean ) is observed between e+a galaxies and elliptical galaxies belonging to the same cluster .",
    "this is not the case if one compares the colors between subsamples 1 and 2 , as shown before .",
    "we emphasize that the average @xmath56 color of the e+a galaxies of subsamples 1 and 2 is similar to the average @xmath56 of the control sample ( at @xmath149 significance level , see figure [ obs_colors ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that all the k - corrections used to obtain average rest - frame colors , as shown in figure [ color_average ] , have been computed using solar metallicity models , assuming that k - corrections , for a given imf , age and sfr scenario do not depend strongly on metallicity .",
    "we tested this assumption using gissel96 seds with different metallicity .",
    "several tests were carried out for different ages , imfs , and sfrs , and metallicity between the extreme values of [ fe / h ] @xmath150 and [ fe / h ] @xmath151 .",
    "differences in k - corrections between these two extreme metal - poor and metal - rich models can reach up to 0.3 mag in @xmath3 at @xmath109 , for a large range of fundamental parameters ( age , imf , and sfr ) . for more modest metallicity differences between models ( probably more realistic ) , variations in k - corrections , for the different near - ir photometric bands , are between 0.15 mag for @xmath3 and 0.05 mag for @xmath4 and @xmath5 , at @xmath109 . for smaller redshifts ,",
    "these differences are even smaller .",
    "figure [ diff_metal ] shows k - correction differences in near - ir bands , as a function of redshift , for two seds ( shown in the inset ) with different metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath152 and [ fe / h ] @xmath153 ) , derived from instantaneous bursts with the same age and imf ( in both cases scalo imf ) .",
    "these k - corrections differences imply @xmath56 and @xmath120 colors shifts no larger than 0.08 mag up to @xmath1 , given that differences in k - corrections , due to different metallicity have the same sign .",
    "we conclude that for a typical interval of metallicity found in the field and in clusters , the effect of varying metallicity should not be significant on the k - correction uncertainties , and hence on rest - frame colors .",
    "however , for more accurate estimates of near - ir colors from broad band photometry , especially at higher redshift ( @xmath154 ) , metallicity does play a significant role on the k - corrections .",
    "the e+a galaxies reported here include 32 galaxies from clusters and 18 galaxies from the field .",
    "in addition , 13 nearby galaxies which do not present post - starburst activity , were observed ( 5 located in clusters at @xmath0 and 8 located in the field at very low redshift ) .",
    "all the galaxies have been observed in the near - ir bands @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 during photometric nights at las campanas observatory . total apparent magnitudes and colors were derived .",
    "the color - color diagram @xmath120/@xmath56 of the observed galaxies is compared to the expected corresponding colors of spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution , at different redshifts .",
    "the models are those generated by gissel96 @xcite .",
    "there is an overall agreement between these expected colors and the observed ones , for the e+a located in nearby clusters ( @xmath144 ) and for e+as located in the field ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "the comparison of the colors of these two samples shows that even though cluster e+as appear bluer than field e+as , the color difference is only significant at @xmath119 level , and therefore we can not strongly affirm that stellar population differences are observed between these two populations .",
    "the colors of the e+a galaxies located in more distant clusters @xmath109 , on the other hand , do not agree with the color expected from models . in the mean , they appear bluer than expected in @xmath120 ( by @xmath156mag ) and redder in @xmath56 ( by @xmath157 mag ) .",
    "the possible interpretation of the failure is strong internal reddening ( mostly in the @xmath3 band ) , not considered in models .    in order to derive a more complete comparison with models , rest - frame colors",
    "were also obtained using two different sources of k - corrections : one based on the work of @xcite , and the other computed using the spectrophotometric model pegase @xcite .",
    "we have shown that such k - corrections can be significant for @xmath158 in the @xmath26 bands ( or any band centered at 2@xmath27 ) , although they are not a strong function of spectral type .",
    "in addition , large differences exist in the k - corrections between these two models , having a large impact on the derived quantities , like rest - frame colors for high redshift galaxies .",
    "we have compared average rest - frame colors of e+a galaxies located in the field and in clusters .",
    "results show that average rest - frame near - ir colors of e+a galaxies located in clusters at @xmath0 @xcite and field e+as located at @xmath2 ( from the lcrs , zabludoff 1996 ) , follow the same color trend in @xmath56 and @xmath120 observed in the comoving color - color diagram : e+a galaxies located in nearby clusters appear bluer than field e+as ( @xmath2 ) .    as well as comparing the observed colors with the gissel96 colors at different redshifts",
    ", the models do not fit the rest - frame colors of the e+a galaxies observed in clusters at @xmath1 .",
    "their @xmath159 colors appear bluer ( using the k - corrections of pegase ) , or redder ( using the k - corrections of poggianti ) compared to the models . their @xmath56 color index ,",
    "although not particularly sensitive to one or the other k - correction , is also redder than the colors predicted by the models .",
    "the color of control galaxies , most of them ellipticals at @xmath160 , and the others from clusters at @xmath0 , agree with the near - ir colors predicted by models .",
    "integrated colors between the _ field _ e+as and the _ cluster _ e+as of the lcrs ( lcrs # 4 , 11 and 20 ; see table [ all_calib ] ) are similar , although those in clusters seem to be slightly ( @xmath161 ) bluer in @xmath120 than the average color .",
    "this result is the same for both sets of rest - frame colors , the set corrected by the pegase k - corrections and the set corrected by the poggianti k - corrections ( see figure [ color_average ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath56 color is similar for the cluster and field e+as in subsample 1 .    in order to build more robust results ,",
    "more field and cluster e+a galaxies have to be observed between @xmath162 .",
    "spectroscopic observations of normal and e+a galaxies at different redshifts in the near - ir are necessary to ( 1 ) obtain calibrated seds and realistic k - corrections , and ( 2 ) to compare the spectra of the e+a galaxies with those of normal galaxies in the whole spectral range 3500    @xmath163  .",
    "we expect to continue this research by imaging new e+a galaxies in the near - ir at higher redshift , as well as obtaining near - ir spectra in order to construct a useful and larger database of normal and post - starburst galaxies in a large spectral range . in order to increase the number of e+a galaxies , some field galaxies already classified as e+as ,",
