    "in the current framework of galaxy evolution , galaxies and black holes are intimately coupled in their formation and evolution .",

    "currently it is not clear how this relation comes about and if and how it evolved over the last 13 gyrs , but basically all semi - analytic models now include feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as a key ingredient to acquire consensus with observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in these models it is assumed that black hole growth by accretion and energetic re - emission from the ignited agn back into the galaxy can form a self regulating feedback chain .",

    "only recently the qso he04502958  renewed the discussion , when @xcite made a case for a 6@xmath12 too faint upper limit of the host galaxy of he04502958  with respect to the @xmath10@xmath11-relation . in light of a number of competing explanations for this , the nature of the he04502958  system",

    "@xcite estimated an expected host galaxy brightness if he04502958  was a normal qso system that obeyed the @xmath10@xmath11-relation in the local universe and given a bh mass estimate or luminosity of the qso .",
    "they concluded that the acs f606w detection limits were six times fainter than the expected value for the host galaxy , which qualified he04502958  to be very unusual .",
    "@xcite sparked a flurry of subsequent papers to explain the undetected host galaxy to black hole relation . over time three",

    "he04502958  is a normal qso nucleus , but with a massive black hole residing in an under - massive host galaxy .",
    "the system is lying substantially off the local @xmath10@xmath11-relation ; the host galaxy possibly hides just below the f606w detection limit @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy is actually absent , he04502958  is a truly `` naked '' qso , by means of a black hole ejection event in a gravitational three body interaction or gravitational recoil following the merger of he04502958  with the companion galaxy @xcite .",
    "the original black hole mass estimate was too high @xcite and is in fact @xmath210 times lower . with comparably narrow ( @xmath21500  km / s fwhm ) broad qso emission lines the qso could be the high - luminosity analog of the class of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nlsy1 ) .",
    "the host galaxy could be normal for the black hole mass and be absolutely consistent with the acs upper limits .",

    "we want to investigate the overall cool and warm dust properties of the system , using new near infrared ( nir ) and mid infrared ( mir ) images .",
    "the f606w acs band is strongly susceptible to dust attenuation , and dust could have prevented the detection of the host galaxy in the optical . with new nir data we look at a substantially more transparent wavelength .    at the same time",

    "is shifted about 15 pixels ( 11 ) from the qso centroid towards the companion galaxy .",

    "two parts of the team analyzed the combined images in complementary ways , by decomposition of the components using two - dimensional modeling and by image deconvolution .      in order to detect a putative faint host galaxy underneath the bright qso nucleus we require a precise knowledge of the psf .",
    "the psf will vary spatially , with the energy distribution in the filter as well as temporally , with a changing effective focus of the telescope due to changing thermal history .",
    "we opt for a double approach : first , we observe the separate psf star with the properties described in the last section ( and see fig .",
    "[ fig : dataimages]b ) .",
    "secondly , we also have the foreground star available that is located at 18 distance from the qso to the north - west .",
    "it is classified as a g star @xcite .",
    "its on - chip distance to the qso will leave only room for small spatial variations , but its sed in the @xmath20-band likely will not perfectly match the sed of the qso .",
    "it is difficult to assess the psf uncertainty at the position of the qso . in principle",
    "we have a combined effect of color , spatial , and temporal variation , but only one bit of information : the difference between the foreground star and the psf star .",
    "we thus model the expected difference in the shape of these two stars with tinytim and then compare their actual observed shapes .",
    "this shows that the foreground star should be slightly narrower than the observed psf star , which is consistent with psf star s later , redder spectral type and an increase of psf width with wavelength .",
    "we observe this effect also in the data , however somewhat stronger . a temporal variation",
    "can thus not be separated and ruled out .    in any case",
    "we conclude that the psf star is wider and thus will yield more conservative ( = fainter ) estimates for a qso host galaxy , while in case of a non - detection the foreground star will yield brighter upper limits .    for two - dimensional modeling of the system we use galfit @xcite . in order to quantify the psf uncertainty for this process , we first let galfit fit a single point source , represented by the psf star , to the foreground star . in this process",
    "we use an error map created from the data itself and we add the sky as a free parameter .",
    "we minimize the influence of the nearby qso on the foreground star by first fitting the former with a single point source as well , removing its modeled contribution , and mask out the remaining residuals starting at 09 from the star .",
    "the psf created in this way is shown in figure  [ fig : dataimages]c .",
    "this image is fed into the modeling process of the psf star , or later the qso / host / companion system .",
    "the residual flux in this process is of the order of 3% of the total , inside the 05 radius aperture where most apparent residuals are located , the absolute value of the residuals in the same region is 14% .",
    "this means that it will be generally impossible to detect any host galaxy of less than 3% of the total flux of the qso , and it will even be difficult to isolate a somewhat brighter smooth galaxy in the non - smooth residuals .",
    "this level of residuals is consistent with experience from the hst acs camera , where we find that due to psf uncertainties 5% of the total flux are approximate detection limits for faint host galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jahnke et al .  in prep . ) .",
    "including the structured psf residuals we will only consider a host galaxy component as significant if it has clearly more than 35% of residual flux inside an 05 radius of the qso , or that shows up as a non co - centric structure above the noise outside this region .    in absolute magnitudes and related to the qso these limits",
    "correspond to the following : inside an 05 radius of the qso we can hide a galaxy co - centric with the qso of at least @xmath23 ( for the 3% case ) or @xmath24 ( for 5% ) .",
    "we detect a single unresolved point source in the visir field - of - view with a flux density 62.5  mjy at observed 11.3@xmath1 m ( figure  [ fig : allwave ] , right column ) .",
    "this compares to 69.3  mjy in the iras 12  @xmath1 m channel .",
    "there is no second source detected in the field down to a point source sensitivity of at least 3  mjy at the 5@xmath22 level .",
    "extended sources of the visual size of the companion galaxy have a 5@xmath22 detection limit of 5.5  mjy .    with only one source in the total 192 visir field three optical sources",
    "have in principle to be considered as potential counterparts : the qso nucleus , the companion galaxy , and the foreground star .",
    "however , the star is a g spectral type and can thus be safely ruled out .",
    "we find that the initial position of the mir point source as recorded in the visir image header comes to lie between the qso and the companion , somewhat closer to the qso . to clarify this we conducted an analysis of the pointing accuracy of visir testing the astrometry of a number of reference stars observed with visir at different epochs .",
    "the two results are : ( 1 ) in all cases the offset between targeted and effective ra , dec is less than 1  rms , but ( 2 ) there is a systematic offset of 0.15s in ra recorded in the fits header , so the true positions need to be corrected by 0.15s in ra .",
    "this correction places the mir point source exactly onto the locus of the qso in the hst acs images .",
    "it is thus clearly the qso nucleus that is responsible for all of the 11.3  @xmath1 m emission .        to extract information on the host galaxy , we use three different methods to remove the flux contribution from the qso nucleus",
    "first , we make a model - independent test for obvious extended emission : in a simple peak subtraction we remove a psf from the qso , scaled to the total flux inside two pixels radius around the qso center .",
    "this is a robust approach that is independent of specific model assumptions and quite insensitive to the noise distribution in the image @xcite . as a result",
    ", the peak subtracted image shows no obvious extended residual , i.e.  host galaxy , centered on the qso , when using the psf star as psf .    as a second step we use on the one hand galfit to model the 2-dimensional light distribution of the he04502958  system and decompose it into different morphological components . on the other hand we use the mcs deconvolution method @xcite to mathematically",
    "deconvolve the system to a well defined and narrower psf .",
    "the procedure we follow is based on the one described in @xcite .",
    "for galfit we use the two empirical psfs , for mcs deconvolution we construct a number of combinations of empirical psf and tinytim models including very red dust - like sed components .    while these two approaches are complementary in method , their results agree as can be seen in figure  [ fig : dataimages ] : the inner part of the qso inside of 05 radius is consistent with a point source within the psf uncertainties , but there is extra flux present outside of this radius .",
    "the structure of the psf removal or deconvolution residuals points to a substantial mismatch between shape of the qso nucleus and the separately observed psf star , but also to too simple models of tinytim . in order to remove obvious residual psf structure a very red sed needs to be assumed , which at this point can not be discriminated from a marginally resolved red component on top of the agn point source .",
    "however , in light of the non - average properties of this qso , a mean qso sed is also not expected .    in the following we present our results in more detail and",
    "focus on the galfit results , since it allows a more direct estimate of the significance of detected structures .",
    "a comparison of the original and point source - removed images in the optical and nir , and the mir image are shown in figure  [ fig : allwave ] .",
    "we use galfit to perform a number of different model fits . in all of them the companion star and qso nucleus are described by a pure point source , while the companion galaxy is fit with one or two srsic .",
    "it reverts to an exponential disk profile typical for spiral galaxies for @xmath25 and for @xmath26 it becomes a de  vaucouleurs profile found for many elliptical galaxies . ]",
    "components with free axis ratio , or left unmodelled .",
    "we also attempt to add another srsic component for the putative host galaxy .",
    "we always leave the srsic parameter @xmath27 free , although the companion galaxy is too complex and the putative host galaxy too faint for @xmath27 to be interpreted physically .    with the psf star used as",
    "psf galfit finds a result consistent with the peak subtraction .",
    "a positive residual of @xmath28 inside a @xmath21  radius aperture has a flux below 2% of the 13.05  mag of the qso itself ( see figure  [ fig : dataimages]e+f ) . even though we choose an aperture larger than in our calculation in section  [ sec : psfuncertainty ] , we receive a value far below our significance limit , so no significant co - centered host galaxy is seen in this way .    if we use the foreground star as psf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dataimages]g ) we find  as expected  a residual flux that is slightly higher than before , and consistent values for two different approaches : first , for a pure psf fit to the qso location , integrating the flux of the residual within a 1  radius aperture around the qso , except along the se  nw - axis where we expect residual flux from foreground star and companion galaxy .",
    "secondly , we get a similar flux for a fitted additional host galaxy srsic component .",
    "these two approaches yield a magnitude of @xmath20@xmath215.8 and 16.2 , respectively , for the host , @xmath21.5mag brighter than for the psf star fit .",
    "@xmath20@xmath216 corresponds to @xmath26% of the 13.05  mag of the qso nucleus .",
    "again the qso residual shows substantial structure as reported in section  [ sec : psfuncertainty ] .",
    "it consists of nested rings of positive and negative flux , typical signs of a close but different width between the psf we use and the actual one .",
    "the bulk of structure is contained in the innermost 05 radius and contains 2/3 of the residual flux .",
    "the remaining residual of 2% of the total flux outside this radius is again insignificant , and no main body of the host galaxy co - centered with the quasar is found which satisfies our significance criterion .",
    "going back to the psf residuals that we quantified earlier on , we detect no co - centered host galaxy at a level above 3% of the flux of the quasar nucleus , corresponding to an upper limit of @xmath29",
    ".        however , after removal of the point source , a feature becomes clearer , what we dub the `` ne - extension '' .",
    "this faint structure extends from the qso to the n  e , and it can be traced starting at the edge of the strong psf residuals at 06 ( 2.5  kpc ) n  e of the nucleus ( figures  [ fig : dataimages ] and [ fig : ne - extension ] ) .",

    "uv - based sfrs must therefore dramatically underestimate the true sfrs when corrected with dust extinction estimated from ( also optical wavelength ) balmer - decrements .",
    "the actual scale of the uncertainty in @xmath38 , the optical extinction correction , can be estimated by comparing @xmath38 estimates from balmer lines and paschen / bracket lines in other ulirgs .",
    "@xcite studied five ulirgs for which they estimated @xmath38 both from h@xmath39/h@xmath40 as well as from pa@xmath41/br@xmath42 .",
    "nir - derived values for a@xmath43 were in every case significantly larger , ranging from factors of @xmath21.16 to @xmath210 ( mean 4.0 ) times higher .",
    "as this factor does not scale in any way with the optical @xmath38 estimate , but only with the nir estimate , we can not determine a correction for he04502958 .",
    "when starting out with the redshifted [ oii]-line at @xmath443727 and @xmath45 like @xcite , and the correction factors from @xcite , a huge range of possible star formation rates arises .",
    "an average of the two _ lowest _ correction values from @xcite of 1.16 and 1.65 means @xmath46 , @xmath47 or corrected sfrs of 21 m@xmath4/yr .",
    "using their mean correction factor of @xmath24 would lead to @xmath48 or @xmath495000 m@xmath4/yr . so already a number below the mean correction ( @xmath50 ) would make these numbers consistent with fir - emission based sfr estimates .",
    "this directly shows that optical / uv line - emission based sfrs as used by @xcite can not at all be used to constrain the true sfr of ulirgs and does not provide an argument against strong star formation in the companion .",
    "@xcite approximate the iras ir sed with a 2-component black - body model and find a cool component @xmath51k , dust mass @xmath52 m@xmath4 and @xmath53 l@xmath4 , and a warm component with @xmath54k , @xmath55 m@xmath4 and @xmath56 l@xmath4 .",
    "we can now for the first time spatially localize the warm component from the detection of the single 11.3@xmath1 m point source with visir to be coincident with the position of the qso nucleus .",
    "since the measured flux density is consistent with a warm component having the previously known 12@xmath1 m iras flux density , we conclude that the qso nucleus itself already is a ulirg - level emitter , but with a warmer component compared to star formation .    for localizing star formation in the system , there are two recent new datasets available , radio data from @xcite and the co maps by @xcite . while the radio maps do not set strong constraints when trying to exploit the radio  fir relation to assign a location for the fir emission , the co data are more powerful : at least the bulk , possibly all of molecular gas and thus star formation activity is located in the companion galaxy .",
    "we can add two further constraints from our nicmos and visir images .",
    "both the mid infrared sed of the system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : iras_sed ] ) as well as an extrapolation from the @xmath20-band are consistent with an arp220-like star formation , while ruling out milder , m82-like conditions . in the latter case",
    "the companion would have to be visible in our observed 11.3@xmath1 m image , but it is absent ( fig .  [",
    "fig : allwave ] ) .",
    "together with the dense and clumpy dust geometry of the companion when comparing optical and nir morphology , it becomes clear that the companion is responsible for most , if not all , of the 370  m@xmath4/yr star formation .",
    "if we follow the 5:1 co detection significance for the companion given by @xcite , this means that as a minimum 5/6=83% of co are located in the companion and thus also @xmath57% of the star formation and fir emission .",
    "this number converts to an integrated ir luminosity of @xmath58 l@xmath4 , so the companion also qualifies as a ulirg .    while the presence of very strong star formation in the companion is clear now , its trigger is a priori not so clear .",
    "the most probably solution is merger induced sf , so the system would be a classical ulirg  just with a non - standard geometry ",
    "but there is room for a radio jet induced effect as well .",
    "one of the lobes of the jets from the qso is located directly at the companion position . if and how much this contributes to star formation in the companion still needs to be quantified .      with",
    "the companion identified as the main star - former , we get limits from the co that less than 1/6 of the total cool dust is located within the putative host galaxy . thus 1/6 of the fir - inferred sfr by @xcite of @xmath59 m@xmath4/yr correspond to an upper limit of 62  m@xmath4/yr .",

    "@xcite , we can convert this to an expected @xmath20-band flux . if the host galaxy had the same population mix as @xcite modelled for the companion galaxy ",
    "95.5% of a 10  gyr old population with 5  gyr e - folding sfr timescale plus 4.5% of a 128  myr young population  , this sfr upper limit would translate to an expected nir magnitude of 1.75  mag fainter than the companion or @xmath60 .",
    "the combined color and @xmath21-correction term is @xmath61 , and changes by only about @xmath620.3mag for a pure old ( 10  gyr ) or young ( 100  myr ) population .",
    "so they are rather insensitive to the exact choice of stellar population . however , this limit will get brighter if the host galaxy contained less dust  by about 0.3  mag per magnitude decrease in @xmath38 .    with that in mind ,",
    "this limit is not more stringent than the limit from nicmos itself : no significant main host galaxy body is found after psf removal ( section  [ results : host ] ) and so an upper limit from the nir decomposition of @xmath29 applies for a host galaxy co - centered with the quasar nucleus .",
    "we therefore conclude that the current upper limit from nicmos lies at around @xmath63 .",
    "this is consistent with the co / fir limits .    how do these numbers relate to the current upper limit for a co - centered host galaxy from the optical hst data ?",
    "we convert our @xmath20-band limit to absolute @xmath15-band magnitudes with again the assumption of the host galaxy having the same stellar population mix as the companion . in the conversion to @xmath64",
    "we assume two different values for dust extinction , ( a ) @xmath65 , motivated by the nearly dust - free line of sight to the qso nucleus , and ( b ) a moderate @xmath66 ( corresponding to @xmath67 ) .",
    "this yields host - galaxy upper limits of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for the cases ( a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "if we convert the @xcite upper limits to our @xmath70 cosmology and assume the same stellar population and dust properties , we receive @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "we note here that this corresponds to a detection limit of only 1.5% of the total quasar flux in the optical .",
    "this factor of two is owed to the better determined psf in the acs images .",
    "this allows @xcite to set somewhat stricter upper limits for a nucleus co - centered host galaxy component , particularly if a low dust extinction is present .",
    "concerning lower limits to the host galaxy , the ne - extension ( figure  [ fig : ne - extension ] ) is a structure of real emission that can be traced towards the qso from @xmath215 to a radius of 06 , where the region of substantial psf residuals begins .",
    "we can not say for sure whether it continues further inward from this position .",
    "signs of this structure are visible in the acs @xmath15-band ( see figure  [ fig : allwave ] , left column ) but it is not clear whether the more compact region only @xmath202 n  e of the nucleus in acs image is real or an artefact of the deconvolution process .",
    "we measured the @xmath73-color to be 2.8 outside this region , which is consistent with a stellar population of intermediate age . in the dust - free case",
    "this color corresponds to a @xmath22.1 gyr old single stellar population ( * ? ? ?",
    "* solar metallicity ) , for @xmath74 to an age of 800 myr .",
    "this is consistent with stellar material from a host galaxy , e.g.  tidally ejected disk stars .",
    "we conclude that with its spatial detachment from the companion galaxy this ne - extension is likely a part of the host galaxy , possibly as a tidal extension , but its vicinity to the qso makes other interpretations less likely . with this interpretation",
    ", we receive an @xmath75 _ lower _",
    "limit for the host , corresponding to @xmath76 ( @xmath65 ) or @xmath77 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "if we include this off - center emission to the upper limit of a co - centered host galaxy , we obtain a total host galaxy upper limit of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "we thus bracket the host galaxy luminosity in the @xmath15-band by 0.8 and 1.3  mag or factors of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "formally , the co detection significance and nicmos give the same limit on a star formation rate of up to @xmath82  m@xmath4/yr .",
    "if we take into account the stricter acs @xmath15-band limits of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , depending on dust cases ( a ) and ( b ) , these are fainter by 1.3 and 0.6mag than the co predicted magnitures .",
    "inversely , these reduce the upper limits on star formation to 18 and 35  m@xmath4/yr , respectively . beyond @xmath83mag",
    "the co and nicmos limits again become the most stringent .",
    "this means that we can not rule out dust obscuration in the host galaxy . at the same time",
    "the dust - free line of sight to the quasar nucleus is a strong argument against large amounts of dust , unless a very special geometrical configuration is invoked , while the warm ulirg emission from the qso points to dust in the very central few 100  pc",

    "<S> the luminous @xmath0 quasar he04502958  is interacting with a companion galaxy at 6.5  kpc distance and the whole system radiates in the infrared at the level of an ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) . </S>",
    "<S> a so far undetected host galaxy triggered the hypothesis of a mostly `` naked '' black hole ( bh ) ejected from the companion by three - body interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we present new hst / nicmos 1.6@xmath1 m imaging data at 01 resolution and vlt / visir 11.3@xmath1 m images at 035 resolution that are for the first time resolving the system in the near- and mid - infrared . </S>",
    "<S> we combine these data with existing optical hst and co maps . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) at 1.6@xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> m we find an extension n - e of the quasar nucleus that is likely a part of the host galaxy , though not its main body . if true , a combination with upper limits on a main body co - centered with the quasar brackets the host galaxy luminosity to within a factor of @xmath24 and places he04502958 directly onto the @xmath3-relation for nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) a dust - free line of sight to the quasar suggests a low dust obscuration of the host galaxy , but the formal upper limit for star formation lies at 60  m@xmath4/yr . </S>",
    "<S> he04502958  is consistent with lying at the high - luminosity end of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies , and more exotic explanations like a `` naked quasar '' are unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) all 11.3@xmath1 m radiation in the system is emitted by the quasar nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> it has warm ulirg - strength ir emission powered by black hole accretion and is radiating at super - eddington rate , @xmath5 , or 12  @xmath6/year . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) the companion galaxy is covered in optically thick dust and is not a collisional ring galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> it emits in the far infrared at ulirg strength , powered by arp220-like star formation ( strong starburst - like ) . </S>",
    "<S> an m82-like sed is ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) with its black hole accretion rate he04502958  produces not enough new stars to maintain its position on the @xmath3-relation , and star formation and black hole accretion are spatially disjoint . </S>",
    "<S> this relation can either only be maintained averaging over a longer timescale ( @xmath7500  myr ) and/or the bulge has to grow by redistribution of preexisting stars . </S>",
    "<S> ( vi ) systems similar to he04502958  with spatially disjoint ulirg - strength star formation and quasar activity might be common at high redshifts but at @xmath8 we only find @xmath94% ( 3/77 ) candidates for a similar configuration . </S>"
