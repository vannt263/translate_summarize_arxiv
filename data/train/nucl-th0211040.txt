    "for the last decade the problem of mesons ( in particular , pions ) in cold and hot nuclei has been one of the most urgent problems of nuclear and hadron physics  @xcite .",
    "is the number of pions per nucleon in nuclei bigger than in a free nucleon ?",
    "do the properties of mesons in nuclei change as compared with ones in vacuum",
    "? do pions give essential additional contribution to the nuclear quark condensate ?",
    "this is not a full list of urgent questions .",
    "one of the most interesting questions in this field is the question about a possibility of separating pions from nucleons in nuclei and pions forming a collective degree of freedom . in the 70 s ,",
    "migdal offered a concept of a pion condensated state in nuclei  @xcite ( for details , see the monograph  @xcite ) . here",
    ", three coupled channels in nucleus are considered : a nucleon on an excited shell - model orbital and a nucleon hole , @xmath4-isobare and a nucleon hole and pions . according to later estimates  @xcite ,",
    "the real nucleon density in nuclei is less than critical one , which is necessary to form a condensate . in the 90 s , g. preparata with his colleagues",
    "@xcite proposed a new mechanism of pionic injecting into nuclei .",
    "he followed ideas by r. dicke about the supperradiation in a system of many identical atoms  @xcite , i.e. about the coherent photon emission .",
    "the power of the emission in this system can be @xmath5 times stronger than that in an isolated atom ( @xmath6 is the number of atoms ) .",
    "it means that a `` superstrong '' interaction of a photon field with the system of atoms appears .",
    "g.preparata extended this concept to a system of nucleons , where @xmath6 and @xmath4-isobare play the role of the ground state and an excited state of an atom , respectively , while the pion field is analogous to the photon one . according to the estimates by g. preparata , in spite of the large energy losses ( @xmath7 300 mev ) , which are necessary to excite the @xmath4-isobare , a powerful coherent interaction between @xmath6- , @xmath8- and @xmath4 subsystems results in pion condensation in nuclei even at the real density @xmath9 .",
    "this is accompanied by the remarkable increase of the binding energy of the nucleus ( which is equal to @xmath7 60 mev per nucleon ) .",
    "the coherence domain includes approximately 70 nucleons .",
    "this `` superradiative '' pionic mode is characterized by momenta of pions @xmath10 ,    @xmath11    @xmath12 and @xmath13 are masses of @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "the number of the collective pions @xmath14 of each kind @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) per nucleon in nuclei with @xmath19 is approximately 0.1  @xcite . it is larger than the corresponding amount of pions in the cloud of an individual nucleon having momenta within @xmath20 range ( see below , we mean the @xmath21-state of the pion in the channel of virtual decay @xmath22",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the experimental situation with pions in nuclei is contradictory . for a long time",
    "it was thought that in nuclei there is a definite deficit of pions . in any case , the number of pions in nuclei is smaller that the rpa approach predicts .",
    "this was reflected in the title of the wellknown paper `` where are the nuclear pions ? '' @xcite .",
    "recently , however an enhancement of pionic degrees of freedom predicted by rpa was observed experimentally .",
    "namely , the longitudinal nuclear response @xmath23 in the ( @xmath24)-reaction on @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 nuclei was measured @xcite .",
    "this reaction is characterized by transfer of pion quantum numbers from proton to the nucleus . values of @xmath23 at the momentum transfer @xmath28 @xmath29 and energy transfer @xmath30 around 60 mev indicate derectly the pionic degrees of freedom in nuclei ( for the @xmath25 target the experiment showed an interesting collective enhancement , indicating excitation of the corresponding charged giant resonance  @xcite ) .",
    "now , the interest in the problem of pion content of nuclei revives .",
    "it is necessary to point out that `` preparata pions '' could not probably be observed as an additional longitudinal responce in @xmath31-reactions .",
    "it is related to an important role of the @xmath4-isobares in the hypothetical preparata phenomenon . in the usual consideration of the relation between nucleon particle - hole responce and contents of pions the role of @xmath4-isobares",
    "is not taken into account .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to propose a very independent kind of experiment , which gives us a possibility to see `` preparata pions '' , i.e.to see directly a momentum distribution ( md , the square of a wave function in the momentum representation ) of collective pions , which are not localized on the nucleon .",
    "we mean the reaction of quasielastic knockout ( qek ) of pions from the nucleus by electrons with energy of a few gev .",
    "the background of qek in microphysics is very rich .",
    "the exclusive processes of the quasielastic knockout of protons from the atomic nucleus by protons ( @xmath32 ) or by electrons ( @xmath33 ) at bombarding energies of a few hundred mev are well known  @xcite .",
    "they were used for investigations of the mds of nucleons on separated shell - model orbitals .",
    "the shape of the md for light nuclei was proved out to be very sensitive to values of the nucleon shell - model quantum numbers @xmath34 .",
    "experimentally , the coincidence technique is used with the energy resolution @xmath35 mev , and the interpretation of results is based on a very simple binary conservation laws    @xmath36    which are valid here , because energies of both initial bombarding particles and two final particles are high ( the impulse approximation  @xcite ) . in eq.2 , @xmath37 is the initial momentum of a virtual particle to be knocked out , and the rest of the notations is evident .",
    "the kinematics of the above process corresponds to the inequalities latexmath:[$|\\vec{q}| \\ll |\\vec{p}_0| , |\\vec{p}_1| ,    the values of @xmath37 and @xmath39 are obtained from the experiment .    one more nuclear example is exclusive reactions ( @xmath40 , etc . of the quasielastic knockout of nucleon clusters by protons with the energy 0.5 - 1 gev . this reaction can be important for identification at high energies  @xcite the mechanisms of deexcitation of virtually excited clusters in nuclei .    the qek process @xmath41 at the beam energies of around 10 kev with the analogous extraction of the electronic mds is widely used in investigations of the electronic structure of atoms , molecules and solids  @xcite .",
    "so , there is a great experience in the investigation of the exclusive qek reactions . in our previous papers  @xcite",
    "we have extended the concept of the qek to the knockout of mesons from nucleons by high energy electrons .",
    "it demanded a relativistic generalization of the theory .",
    "namely , the pole @xmath42-diagram reflecting a virtual creation of , say , @xmath43 pair was taken into account in addition to the usual diagram of pion knockout ( the instantaneous form of dynamics ) .",
    "the second important point was that it is possible to separate experimentally the reactions induced by longitudinal virtual photons @xmath44 and ones induced by transverse virtual photons @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "this offers a unique way  @xcite to investigate the mds of pions ( @xmath46 subprocess ) and @xmath3-mesons ( @xmath47 subprocess ) separately , by means of the @xmath48 reaction with the squared mass of virtual photon @xmath49 of about 2 - 4 ( gev/@xmath50)@xmath51 .    in the present paper",
    "we extend this approach to the investigation of the pionic degrees of freedom in nuclei .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we represent shortly a relativistic formalism for the qek reactions . in the third section ,",
    "a simple expression for the mds of the collective pion in the preparata model is derived and compared with that of pions localized on nucleons in a nucleus . in the fourth section , another variable , which is observable in the @xmath52 experiment",
    ", the md of @xmath3-mesons in the nucleus is calculated within the model of @xmath3-meson localization on the nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "the fifth section outlines the advantage of the @xmath52 process in comparison with a @xmath53 reaction and @xmath54 qek process .",
    "according to the general theory of meson electroproduction  @xcite , the differential cross section of the reaction @xmath55 may be separated into longitudinal ( l ) and transverse ( t ) components , along with interference terms by varying kinematical variables of the final detected particles , @xmath16 and @xmath56 ( rosenbluth separation ) .",
    "this important result is usually discussed in terms of the independent variables @xmath57 ( @xmath58 is a 4-momentum of the virtual photon ) , @xmath59 ( @xmath60 is the invariant mass of the final hadrons ) , @xmath61  @xcite . such a parametrisation is convenient , if we have in mind a broad kinematical region , including , say , resonances .",
    "but in a narrow region corresponding to the quasielastik knockout , the traditional five variables @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 of the nonrelativistic qek theory are more efficient  @xcite .",
    "having in mind this remark , we can write for the longitudinal cross section of the qek process on a nucleus an expression , that is very close to formulae in  @xcite    @xmath65    where the right part contains only one , predominant pole component  @xcite at @xmath66 ( gev/@xmath50)@xmath51 . here , @xmath67 and @xmath63 are energy and a solid angle of the final electron ; d@xmath64 is an element of a solid angle of the final pion in the lab system ; @xmath68 is energy of the initial electron , @xmath69 is momentum of the virtual pion ; @xmath70 ; @xmath71 and @xmath72 are momentum and energy of the knocked - out real pion ; @xmath73 is the invariant flux of electrons and pions ; @xmath74 is the md of pions in the channel @xmath75 ; and , finally , @xmath76 is a cross section of a free scattering process @xmath77 .",
    "the bar means spin projection average quantity .",
    "the transverse cross section is given by a formula very close to the formulae in  @xcite    @xmath78    here @xmath79 .",
    "eq.(4 ) is valid at @xmath80 ( gev/@xmath50)@xmath51  @xcite .",
    "both free cross sections include relevant electromagnetic form factors  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross sections @xmath81 for the both mechanisms are given by    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is an angle between the incident electron and the final pion .",
    "for the elastic scattering off point pions the square amplitude is equal to    @xmath84    for the scattering off point @xmath3-mesons ( with de - excitation ) ( see appendix )    @xmath85,\\ ] ]    where @xmath86 is the constant of conversion of the @xmath3-meson into pion , @xmath87 is the mott cross section @xmath88 , @xmath89 is an angle between the incident and scattered electrons , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath58 are 4-momenta of the incident electron , @xmath3-meson and photon .",
    "having in mind the preparata model  @xcite , we suppose for simplicity , that the coherence domain coresponds to the whole nucleus . hence , a radial wave function of the collective pion has a form of the standing @xmath21-wave  @xcite    @xmath92    @xmath93 and nucleons in the initial and final nuclear states",
    "occupy the same shell in the mshell - model , transitions like @xmath94 , @xmath95 , etc .",
    "take place .",
    "the situation is close to weak coupling of the pion to the nucleus . in eq .",
    "( 8) , @xmath96 means the radius of the domain . its value should correspond to @xmath97 at @xmath19 .",
    "next , the constant @xmath50 is defined by the normalization of the wave function ( 8) to the abovementioned value @xmath98 , so @xmath99 . by the fourier transformation of the single - particle wave function ( 8)",
    ", we obtain the md of the collective pions @xmath100 .",
    "this md corresponds to the longitudinal cross section ( 3 ) , ( 5 ) and is presented in fig.1 ( solid curve ) with normalization to one nucleon to facilitate its comparison with the dashed curve ( the md of pions in a free nucleon , see below ) .",
    "the solid curve should be multiplied by @xmath101 to compare it with experimental data .",
    "it has a bright maximum at @xmath102 , i.e. it is close to the plane wave within the limitation imposed by the finite volume of the nucleus .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the md of the pion in a free nucleon @xmath103 ( @xmath104 channel of the virtual decay ) , which we have reconstructed  @xcite from the @xmath105 experiment  @xcite .",
    "this experiment , in fact , was carried out at the quasielastic kinematics  @xcite ( @xmath49 was large enough : @xmath106 ( gev/@xmath50)@xmath51 ) .",
    "our analysis  @xcite was based on the relativistic pole approximation in the laboratory system , which included a pole @xmath42-diagram .",
    "fig.2 represents a washed - out md of the localized pions @xmath107 ( thick solid line ) obtained by the convolution of the md of pions in a free nucleon ( dashed line ) with the averaged md of the shell - model nucleons in nucleus @xmath108 ( solid line ) :",
    "@xmath109    both the md of pions in a free nucleons and the washed - out md of the localized pions , in contrast to the md of pions in the preparata model , are very smooth at @xmath91 values , which are close to @xmath110 .",
    "the momentum distributions corresponding to fig.1,2 are isotropic with respect to @xmath37 direction , because they are averaged over the magnetic quantum numbers of the pionic @xmath21-orbital .",
    "the main point here is that the knockout of the delocalized collective pions is accompanied by recoil to the final nucleus as a whole , with the corresponding very small recoil energy @xmath111 mev ( @xmath112 ) , although the momentum @xmath110 itself is not small ( see eq .",
    "this is why such prediction is not trivial .",
    "the md of such pions has a sharp maximum at @xmath102 .    the wave function of pions ( 8) does not contain pion - nucleon spacious correlations and , as a result , the final recoil nucleus will not be internally excited .",
    "in fact , the best experimental energy resolution @xmath113 may be around 10 mev here , and this severe simplification partly softens .",
    "the real situation will correspond to the summation over many exited states of the external shell of the final nucleus , i.e. to a sum rule .    at the same time , the opposite extreme case of the knockout of pions with the same virtual momentum @xmath69 , @xmath114 from the pion cloud of an individual nucleon will be characterized by a large value of the recoil energy transfered to one nucleon , @xmath115 mev .",
    "this nucleon , with a large probability , will be directly emitted from the nucleus ( we mean here the numerous weakly bound nucleons of the external shell ) .",
    "a reliable identification of this event requires triple coincidences @xmath116 , which is an urgent experimental problem . in a noncomplete experiment with only double coincidences",
    "@xmath117 , the abovementioned event will be perceived as a corresponding high excitation ( @xmath118 mev ) of the final recoil nucleus accompanied by the transfer of the momentum @xmath119 , @xmath114 to this nucleus .",
    "this group of events will show a very smooth md of the virtual pions like the corresponding part of the thick solid line in fig.2 at @xmath91 around @xmath110 .",
    "the discussed recoil of the proton in the process of the @xmath17 knockout from the nucleus can also create one of the charged nuclear giant resonances with the excitation energy @xmath30 of a few tens mev ( see above , the discussion of the @xmath120 meson transfer reaction ) .",
    "an intriguing new opportunity here is to investigate a @xmath91-dependence of such cross sections .",
    "so , the principal result of this section is that the high - energy pion electroproduction on nuclei by means of the virtual longitudinal photons @xmath44 at the kinematics of the qek process at small @xmath30 values of a few mev offers an opportunity to see the cooperative , maximally delocalized pions in nuclei by the most direct way .",
    "the bright md maximum at @xmath121 gev/@xmath50 ( the solid line in fig.1 ) will be the principal sign of the presence of such pions in the nucleus .",
    "the increase of @xmath30 corresponds , qualitatively , to increasing localization of the discussed virtual pions in the nucleus , and the shape of the md measured at different @xmath30 may be helpful for the clarification of evolution of the reaction mechanism with the increase of the excitation energy @xmath30 ( the usage of the triple coincidence would be very urgent here , too ) .",
    "it must be noted , that final energy of the knocked - out pion should be not lower than 1 gev to avoid disturbing influence of the intermediate resonance ( @xmath4-isobare ) in the @xmath122 final state interaction .",
    "energies much higher than 1 gev are also not suitable because they correspond to the different physics of asymptotical quark counting rules  @xcite .",
    "this physics , which corresponds to the @xmath49 values of 10 - 20 ( gev/@xmath50)@xmath51 and rather small cross sections , is very popular now  @xcite .",
    "but our physics of the soft hadronic degrees of freedom in the nucleons and nuclei , which corresponds to rather moderate @xmath49 values of 2 - 4 ( gev/@xmath50)@xmath51 and which is unfortunately still in the shadow , is not less interesting . by the way",
    ", it corresponds to the quite measurable cross sections .",
    "as it was noted in the section 1 , here we will discuss the model of @xmath3-mesons localized on nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "the md of the @xmath3-mesons may be obtained by means of the qek reaction such as @xmath123 initiated by the transverse virtual photons , @xmath124 .",
    "the principal experimentally observed difference of the model under consideration from the discussed above model of the pionic degrees of freedom is that the md should be the same for any @xmath30 value , i.e. that the md does not depend on a microscopic process , which follows the recoil to the nucleon ( at the small @xmath91 , @xmath125 gev/@xmath50 , either a soft nuclear excitation within the lowest shell - model configuration for small @xmath30 of a few mev , or an excitation of the charged giant resonance for @xmath126 mev take place ; at the relatively large @xmath91 , @xmath114 , either an excitation of the charged giant resonance at @xmath127 mev or a direct emission of the recoil nucleon at @xmath128 mev take place , etc . ) .",
    "starting with the @xmath3-meson md in the nucleon @xmath129 ( dashed line in fig.3 )  @xcite , we take into account fermi motion of nucleons in the nucleus by means of eq.(9 ) and obtain , finally , the solid curve in fig.3 analogous to the thick solid curve in fig.2 but extended to much larger values of @xmath91 due to the large value of the mass @xmath130 mev .",
    "this curve represents the washed - out md of @xmath3-mesons in the nucleus @xmath131 if they are localized on nucleons",
    ". a deviation of experimental results from this shape , similar to the deviation of the solid curve in fig.1 from the thick solid curve in fig.2 will mean the delocalization of @xmath3-mesons in the nucleus ( see above , section 2 ) .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed a program of the direct experimental investigation of the pionic wave functions in nuclei by means of the quasielastic knockout reactions @xmath132 or @xmath133 initiated by electrons with energy of a few gev and mediated by the longitudinal virtual photons .",
    "it has been demonstrated , that the momentum distribution of the delocalized pions in the cooperative model by preparata is qualitatively different from the md of the pions localized on nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "it is expected that the corresponding spectra of excitation energies of the final nucleus - spectator , @xmath30 , will be rather different in these two cases .",
    "futher , having in mind the @xmath134 or @xmath135 reaction mediated by the transverse photons , we have demonstrated , as a basic example , the md of @xmath3-mesons in nucleus within the simplest model of @xmath3-mesons localized on nucleons in the nucleus .    recently , the investigation of the @xmath136 quasielastic knockout process has been initiated  @xcite , although the energies of the knocked - out pions are still not high enough .",
    "the cross sections here are larger ( strong interaction ) than those for the @xmath52 reaction , and the @xmath136 reaction gives an opportunity to investigate the @xmath18-component of the collective field , but distortion and absorption effects  @xcite for three pionic waves in the @xmath136 reaction are much more pronounced than those for one pionic wave in the @xmath52 process .",
    "so , these two reactions , the @xmath52 reaction of a volume character with smaller cross sections and the @xmath136 reaction of a surface character with larger cross sections , can complement each other rather efficiently .",
    "finally , it should be noted , that the analogous process @xmath137 on nuclei ( @xmath138 ) corresponds to the interference of amplitudes for a few different diagrams  @xcite and does not offer a direct way for extracting the mds of pions in nuclei .",
