    "physics on the nanoscale has developed enormously in the last decade and the construction of a wide variety of nanoscale systems has become possible .",
    "this usually proceeds through either an atom by atom manipulation using stm , or by growth on a substrate favorable to the formation of the desired nanostructure .",
    "stand out amongst the latter category of experiments has been the production of parallel monoatomic chains aligned along the step edges of a pt vicinal substrate @xcite .",
    "vicinal substrates , created by the controlled miscut of the crystal off a high symmetry plane , present an ordered array of step edges and thus form an ideal template for the growth of monoatomic wires .",
    "one of the fundamental issues which arises in the context of nanophysics is how very well known phenomena such as magnetism are altered in systems of reduced dimensionality . a variation in the magnetic properties of the 3d and 4d transition metals as a function of dimensionality and",
    "substrate type has been observed on several occasions @xcite , where the systems investigated have ranged from zero - dimensional adatoms , monowires , and monolayers .",
    "the picture that has emerged from these investigations is that elements which in the bulk situation are non - magnetic may develop large magnetic moments in the nanoscale .",
    "more precisely it has been observed that the peak of the moment - valence plot shifts to lower valence as the dimensionality is reduced .",
    "however , the early prediction of the magnetism of two dimensional monolayers of 4d metals was not realized in many cases .",
    "this was due to the sensitivity of the magnetism to structural defects and relaxation , these tending to reduce the magnetic moment from that of the ideal structure .",
    "on the other hand the recent investigation of the magnetic nature of the 3d metal co deposited in one - dimensional chains on the pt@xmath0 surface @xcite showed a dramatically enhanced spin and orbital moment .    from the theoretical point of view one of the problems with the study of low dimensional systems",
    "is that the reduction in symmetry and the corresponding increase in system size mean that the calculations can become quite demanding .",
    "this is simply due to that fact that most of the theoretical approaches scale as @xmath1 , with n the number of inequivalent sites .",
    "ab initio _ techniques with more favorable scaling do exist however .",
    "in particular , bellini _",
    "_ @xcite have determined the magnetic structure of 4d monoatomic rows on ag vicinal surfaces , using an _ ab inito _ method that scaled as order @xmath2 with the number of substrate layers .",
    "however the scaling with the number of inequivalent wire atoms remained @xmath1 .",
    "this , as the authors noted , meant that calculations involving inequivalent wire atoms ( needed for the calculation of antiferromagnetic wire configurations ) became again very demanding . on the other hand , eisenbach _ et al",
    "_ have recently deployed a genuine _ ab inito _",
    "order @xmath2 method in the study of fe monowires embedded in a cu matrix . using this approach",
    "they were able to determine the magnetic structure of the fe wire .",
    "_ ab inito _",
    "order @xmath2 methods clearly hold a lot of promise for the investigation of systems on the nanoscale . with the ability to calculate systems of several hundred atoms one can consider , for example , magnetic clusters either embedded within the bulk of another material or deposited on a substrate",
    ". however , the favorable scaling of order @xmath2 methods comes at a certain price of accuracy .",
    "this is due , in the case of the method deployed by eisenbach _",
    "et al . _ and to the related method used by us in this work , to their being only _ locally self consistent_. hence",
    ", it is necessary to establish that the magnitudes of quantities one is interested in are within the scope of the method .    in this work",
    "we investigate the magnetic properties of 3d nanowires deposited on the step edges of a pt vicinal surface .",
    "we consider both ferromagnetic ( fm ) as well as anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) magnetic configurations , and establish the accuracy of the method for the relevant magnetization energies .",
    "although the calculations we perform here do not have spin - orbit ( so ) coupling this will not be important for the determination of energy differences between fm and afm magnetic configuations , which will be order the order of mry and hence orders of magnitude bigger than the magnetic anisotropy from the so interaction .",
    "a vicinal surface is one created by miscutting away from a high symmetry plane .",
    "these surfaces neccesarily display a periodic array of steps aligned along some specific direction , separated by terraces of the high symmetry plane the surface was miscut from .",
    "we will consider here a surface miscut off the high symmetry ( @xmath3 ) plane . in this case",
    "there are two possible vicinal surfaces with steps that have either ( @xmath4 ) or ( @xmath5 ) microfacets .",
    "these two families of surfaces are described by the miller indices ( @xmath6 ) and ( @xmath7 ) respectively with @xmath8 being the number of atomic rows in the terraces separating steps .",
    "the template that we use for depositing the 3d monowires on will in this study be the ( @xmath6 ) vicinals , and we consider surfaces with 2 atom wide and 4 atom wide terraces . as usual",
    "we replac the semi - infinite geometry with that of a supercell which is then periodically repeated in space .",
    "this leaves us with a slab with two surfaces , one of which we will decorate with a monowire .",
    "it is important that these slabs should not interact and also that the two surfaces should not interact across the slab .",
    "here we accomplish this by separating the slabs which are 8 ( @xmath3 ) layers in thickness by 7 ( @xmath3 ) vacuum layers .",
    "this leads to supercells of 25 atoms and 55 atoms for the ( @xmath9 ) and ( @xmath10 ) vicinals respectively . in order to consider the possibility of anti - ferromagnetic solutions of the monowire we simply double the supercell in the wire direction , leading to supercells of 50 and 110 atoms",
    "the locally self - consistent green s function method ( lsgf ) @xcite is based on an approach whereby a supercell of @xmath2 sites is divided into @xmath2 separate _ local interaction zones _ ( liz ) each of @xmath11 sites .",
    "the motive for this construction is the observation that that the properties of the central site in each liz will approach those that would be found by a full solution of the supercell as @xmath12 .",
    "this is very similar to the locally self - consistent multiple scattering ( lsms ) method used by eisenbach _ et .",
    "al _ in their work on fe wires embedded in cu @xcite .",
    "essentially , the only difference between the two approaches is that in the lsms method each liz is embedded within a free electron gas whilst in the lsgf method one embedded the liz into some judiciously chosen effective medium .",
    "formally this is achieved by writing a dyson equation for the central site of each liz    @xmath13    by solving this equation for every site in the supercell one finds the diagonal element of green s function matrix @xmath14 for all sites , and from this set one can construct the effective medium green s function @xmath15 .",
    "this process is then iterated to self - consistency being first initiated by some suitable guess .",
    "one must note that although the full green s function matrix @xmath16 will not correspond to that of the supercell under consideration , provided @xmath11 is large enough , the site diagonal element will . since it is the only the site diagonal elements that are required to determine the local density of states for each site one may extract reliable information on charge density , one electron energy , and total energy of the supercell from this method .",
    "the effective medium plays only the role of a boundary condition for the liz , but convergence with liz size will be strongly affected by this choice @xcite . in the case of a highly inhomogeneous structure one way to proceed is by making the effective medium more complicated ( for example by allowing for inequivalent effective atoms ) , however in the case of a vicinal surface this is not practical .",
    "( since the number of inequivalent vicinal layers is equal to the number of sites in the supercell . ) we therefore proceed by the use of the simplest single site effective medium construction .",
    "the criteria that such an effective medium should sattisfy in such a case is that the `` effective atom '' most resembles the maximum number of sites . with only one type of effective medium site",
    "this is clearly not possible in the case of seperate vacuum and metal regions in the supercell .",
    "a way that suggests itself is to sattisfy the two natural limits by having an effective vacuum atom and an effective metal atom . near the interface region",
    "the size liz will need to be large to eliminate the error at the central site , but away from the interface region the effective medium will come to resemble more and more closely the real material and hence the error with the same size of the liz is smaller .    for simplicity we choose here a single site effective medium constructed from all metal sites via the average @xmath17-matrix approach .",
    "the rational behind this can be seen by considering the liz around an atom in the surface .",
    "the error committed for vacuum sites in the liz should be less important , as the density of states there is anyway small , while the error for the metal sites will be less for not having a spurious vacuum term in the effective medium , and indeed should vanish in those sites which no longer feel the perturbation of the surface .    one must emphasize that there is no _ direct scattering _ between distant sites in this method . beyond the liz boundary",
    "the effective medium is single site and contains only information related to the underlying lattice and no information whatever about the geometry of the vicinal surface .",
    "hence quantum effects due entirely to such direct scattering processes with be lost .",
    "this may be of importance when considering , for example , step - step interactions .",
    "the method deployed here was a real space technique based on the korringa - kohn - rostoker green s function scheme in the atomic sphere approximation .",
    "the basis consisted of @xmath18 , @xmath8 , and @xmath19 orbitals , and corrections to the spherical charge density were included up to @xmath20 .",
    "the calculations were performed in the local density approximation ( lda ) with the perdew , burke , and ernzerhof parameterization of the results of ceperly and alder .",
    "the integration of the green s function was taken in the complex plane with 16 energy points on a semi - circular contour .",
    "the lattice parameter for pt was taken to be the theoretical lda value .",
    "[ fig : moments ]    [ fig : momrs ]    the success of the lsgf method as a genuine order-@xmath2 method for arbitrary structures depends of course on how quickly is the convergence with respect to the liz size . by construction the rate of convergence of the supercell will depend solely on the convergence of the individual liz s .",
    "this in turn depends on how well the effective medium corresponds to the system at hand .",
    "a consequence of this is that the convergence of the total energy should become worse linearly with increasing @xmath2 . in table",
    "[ tab : convte ] are shown the total energies for the supercell consisting of a co monowire deposited on pt ( @xmath10 ) . from this",
    "one may conclude that a liz of 55 atoms is enough to capture the energetics of this system . in table",
    "[ tab : convme ] are shown the wire and substrate magnetic moments and magnetization energies .",
    "the convergence is better for the wire than for the substrate quantities . for the moments this can be understood as due to the fact the",
    "the 3d monowire will be a very good local moment system whereas the pt substrate is of more itinerant character .",
    "the more localised the magnetic moment the better it is expected to converge in real space .",
    ".[tab : convte ] total energies for fm and afm co wires on pt(@xmath10 ) substrate . also shown",
    "is the difference @xmath21 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : conve ] the convergence of the quantity e@xmath22 - e@xmath23 for all the 3d monowires from v to ni deposited on a pt ( @xmath9 ) substrate . clearly , the convergence is with liz is sufficient that one can state clearly which solution is preferable for each wire .",
    "[ fig : conve ]",
    "we now turn to the trends of wire moment and energetics versus the d band filling . in fig . [",
    "fig : moments ] we show the wire , substrate , and vacuum moments for the elements v to ni , ti and sc being found to display no magnetic solutions for the monowire geometry considered here . as was found by blgel @xcite in the case of monolayers of 3d elements",
    "we find stable fm and afm solutions for all monowires .",
    "this indicates again that the monowire forms a good local moment system and particularly so for the mn , fe , and co wires where the moments of the fm and afm configurations are almost identical .",
    "[ fig : energy ]    the total moment of the pt substrate on the other hand is sensitive to the magnetic configuration of the monowire , and changes from around 1 @xmath24 to almost zero when the wire configuration changes from fm to afm .",
    "one can note that the substrate moment associated with the fm monowire has a node between cr and mn , so that only for v and cr does the substrate couple anti - ferromagnetically to the fm monowire .",
    "the large polarization of the substrate associated with the fm configuration is to be expected considering work on 3d impurities in pd and pt where a large polarization cloud of several @xmath24 was observed experimentally and theoretically .",
    "this being due to the fact that bulk pt is near a magnetic instability . in fig . [",
    "fig : momrs ] we show the total magnetic moment of each principle layer of the ( @xmath10 ) and ( @xmath9 ) vicinals , the decay of the moment is fairly slow and one can observe that nearly all layers of the pt slab have become polarised . on the other hand",
    ", the absence of a significant polarization of the substrate for the afm monowire configuration indicates that the magnetic coupling is strongly ferromagnetic for the pt vicinal surface . the magnetic moment associated with the vacuum sites",
    "is seen to be largest earlier in the d series , which is expected due to the larger spatial extent of the d orbitals for the early 3d transition metals .",
    "we note that the values found here for the co wire spin moment and associated substrate moments are in close agreement with the very similar vicinal studied experimentally by gambardella @xcite _ et .",
    "al_.    the quantity @xmath25 is expected to possess two nodes across the d series and in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] it can be seen that the second of these nodes occurs between mn and fe , whereas the first would likely be seen between ti and v if the ti monowire was magnetic .",
    "thus we find that the v , cr , and mn monowires prefer and afm structure whereas fe , co , and ni monowire prefer the fm structure .",
    "turning now to the site projected energies one can see that the contribution to @xmath26 from the vacuum and substrate sites is rather large away from the middle of the d - series .",
    "the origin of the importance of this terms lies in the very different polarization of the surrounding depending of the magnetic configuration of the wire .",
    "this might be expected to cause complications for approaches based on extracting effective interactions for a heisenberg model via the force theorem . in this case",
    "one does perturbation theory on a particular magnetic structure , and thus would be unable to take account of the change in energy coming from the change in polarization of the environment .",
    "we have studied monowire of 3d elements deposited on pt ( @xmath9 ) and ( @xmath10 ) vicinal surfaces using a real space order-@xmath2 method , and have investigated the convergence of various quantities as a function of the liz size .",
    "we demonstrate that the method is suitable for a quantitative determination of the magnetization energies of the monowires , although the calculation of step - step interactions would appear to be at the limit of what the method can achieve .",
    "nevertheless , there are many interesting magnetic structures , such as magnetic vicinals , which could be calculated with this approach ."
