    "the nature and properties of a piezoacoustic surface wave depend heavily on the crystallographic and anisotropic properties of the piezoelectric substrate , on the direction of propagation , and on the orientation of the cut ( boundary ) plane . for certain choices ,",
    "the in - plane components of the mechanical displacement decouple from the anti - plane component , leading to two different types of surface waves namely , the rayleigh wave , elliptically polarized in the plane containing the direction of propagation and the normal to the substrate surface , and the shear - horizontal ( sh ) wave , linearly polarized in the direction normal to the direction of propagation and parallel to the free surface .",
    "moreover , either wave or both waves may be coupled to the electromagnetic fields .",
    "of special interest are the configurations allowing for a piezoacoustic sh wave , decoupled from a purely elastic rayleigh wave .",
    "indeed , the former type of wave , also known as bleustein - gulyaev@xcite wave , penetrates more deeply into the substrate than the latter type ; consequently , the acoustic energy is less localized and the power can be increased significantly before damage occurs ( tseng@xcite ) although , as pointed out by a referee , there are exceptions to this behavior@xcite .",
    "moreover , a sh wave - based resonator is smaller than a resonator based on the propagation of a sagittally polarized surface wave ( see kadota and collaborators @xcite ) ; this feature results in a downsizing of design , an attractive point for the miniaturization of mobile phones for instance , where saw devices are used as filters .",
    "koerber and vogel@xcite identified all the cuts and rotations of axes leading to piezoacoustic sh modes ; they exist for some suitable cuts and transformations in the following crystal classes : 2 , 23 , @xmath2 m , 222 , 2 mm , 4 , @xmath0 , 6 , 4 mm , 6 mm , 32 , @xmath1 m , @xmath9m2 , 422 , and 622 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to derive explicitly the secular equation for piezoacoustic sh surface waves uncoupled from purely elastic rayleigh waves polarized in a plane of symmetry , for a crystal in the @xmath0 symmetry class ( and thus for the @xmath1 m , @xmath2 m , and 23 classes ) .",
    "several workers addressed this topic in the wake of the seminal papers by bleustein and by gulyaev , but explicit results remained limited either to propagation in special directions for which one of the piezoelectric constant is zero@xcite or to the case where the free surface of the substrate is metallized@xcite , or in the weak piezoelectric coupling approximation@xcite . here",
    "the crystal is cut along a plane containing the @xmath4 axis and making _ any _ angle with the @xmath10 crystallographic plane .",
    "moreover the surface may be metallized , or in contact with the vacuum , or in contact with a thin conducting layer with arbitrary finite conductance .",
    "also , no approximation is made about the strength of the piezoelectric effect .",
    "attention is however limited to crystals with tetragonal @xmath0 symmetry ( inclusive of the tetragonal @xmath1 m , cubic @xmath2 m , and cubic 23 symmetries ) .",
    "this limitation is not essential but simplifies the notation to a certain extent ; it is nevertheless possible to extrapolate the method presented hereafter to crystals with lower symmetries such as orthorhombic 222 , as pointed out at the end of the paper .",
    "note that the study of piezoacoustic sh surface waves in potassium niobate ( 2 mm symmetry ) was recently undertaken by mozhaev and weihnacht@xcite who showed that for that class , the secular equation is a cubic in the squared wave speed .",
    "the constitutive equations and the piezoacoustic equations for the class of crystals listed above are recalled in ii.a and ii.b , respectively , and some fundamental equations , which encapsulate the whole boundary value problem and its resolution , are quickly derived in ii.c .    these fundamental equations are applied in section iii to the consideration of a piezoacoustic sh surface wave . a method based on the resolution of the propagation condition for partial modes first , and the resolution of the boundary value conditions next , would lead to quite an involved analysis , including the analytical examination of a quartic polynomial for the coefficients of attenuation .",
    "the method based on the fundamental equations derived in ii.c circumvents the stage of the quartic and delivers directly the secular equation in polynomial form .",
    "in particular it is seen that for metallized ( a.k.a .",
    "short - circuit ) boundary conditions ( iii.a ) , this equation is just a quadratic in the squared wave speed , whose relevant root is readily identified . for open - circuit boundary conditions ( iii.b ) ,",
    "the secular equation is also a quadratic in the squared wave speed , but it is not valid ( the corresponding solution does not satisfy the boundary conditions . ) for the free ( non - metallized ) boundary condition ( iii.c ) , the secular equation is a sextic in the squared wave speed .",
    "for the conductive thin layer boundary condition ( iii.d ) , the secular equation is a polynomial of degree 16 in the wave speed .",
    "once the secular equation is solved for the speed , the complete description of the wave follows naturally ( iv.a ) , including the attenuation coefficients and the profiles for the mechanical displacement , electric potential , traction , and electrical induction .",
    "a simple check for the validity of the solution is proposed in iv.b .",
    "the results are illustrated numerically and graphically using experimental data available for gaas ( cubic @xmath2 m ) , balaga@xmath5o@xmath6 ( tetragonal @xmath1 m ) and bi@xmath7geo@xmath8 ( cubic 23 ) in v. the range of existence of the free sh wave with respect to the angle of cut , the speeds of propagation , the amplitude of the profiles , etc .",
    "are all quantities which can be obtained numerically with as high a degree of numerical accuracy as is needed .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion of the merits and possible applications of the method presented , and with a chronological account of the several advances in the field , without which the results of this paper could not have been established .",
    "consider a piezoelectric crystal with mass density @xmath11 , possessing at most the tetragonal @xmath0 symmetry ( this symmetry includes the tetragonal @xmath1 m , cubic @xmath2 m , and cubic @xmath12 cases . )",
    "let @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 be its respective elastic , piezoelectric , and dielectric constants with respect to the coordinate system @xmath16 along the crystallographic axes .",
    "now cut the crystal by a plane containing the @xmath4 axis and making an angle @xmath17 with the @xmath10 plane .",
    "the new coordinate system @xmath18 ( say ) , obtained after rotation of @xmath16 about @xmath4 , is defined by @xmath19 and so , the plane of cut is defined by @xmath20 , as shown on figure 1 .    in the new coordinate system , under the electrostatic approximation for the electrical field ,",
    "the stress tensor components @xmath21 and the electric induction components @xmath22 are related to the gradients of the mechanical displacement @xmath23 and of the electrical potential @xmath24 by the constitutive relations , @xmath25 where the comma denotes partial differentiation ( here with respect to the @xmath26 coordinates ) . using the voigt contracted notation for the @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , these relations are written in matrix form as @xmath30    explicitly , the @xmath31 and @xmath32 are deduced from the @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xmath16 by well - known relationships . in particular , @xmath35      now consider the propagation of an anti - plane ( sh ) inhomogeneous wave in the half - space @xmath36 , travelling with speed @xmath37 and wave number @xmath38 in the @xmath39 direction , with attenuation in the @xmath40 direction .",
    "it is known@xcite that for the crystals under consideration this wave decouples entirely from its in - plane counterpart , a purely elastic two - component rayleigh wave .",
    "thus the wave is modelled as @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for some yet unknown functions @xmath43 and @xmath44 of @xmath45 .",
    "accordingly , the constitutive equations eq .",
    "lead to similar forms for the stress and electrical components , @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 here and hereafter , the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the variable @xmath45 .    using the above - introduced functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , the classical equations of piezoacoustics , @xmath51 reduce to @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "when the region @xmath54 above the crystal is the vacuum ( permeability : @xmath55 ) and the surface @xmath20 remains free of tractions , then the boundary value problem corresponding to eq .",
    "is that of piezoacoustic ( bleustein - gulyaev ) sh surface waves .",
    "the method of resolution rests on the property that the piezoacoustic equations can be written in the form , @xmath56^\\text{t},\\ ] ] and @xmath57 is a real 4@xmath584 matrix which , brought up to any positive or negative integer power @xmath59 has the following block structure , @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the transpose , and where the submatrices of @xmath62 are @xmath63 matrices .",
    "the first - order differential form eq .   of the piezoacoustic equations dates back to kraut@xcite , and before that , to stroh@xcite and others ( see fahmy and adler@xcite for references ) for the purely elastic case .",
    "the subsequent analysis below builds upon several crucial contributions , which are listed and put into context at the very end of this article .",
    "now , because the wave amplitude must vanish away from @xmath64 , @xmath65 is such that @xmath66    clearly , pre - multiplication of @xmath62 by @xmath67 defined as , @xmath68 produces a symmetric matrix , @xmath69 so that taking the scalar product on both sides of eq .   by @xmath70 , where the overbar denotes the complex conjugate , leads to @xmath71 , the right hand - side of which is purely imaginary .",
    "taking the real part and integrating yields @xmath72 const .",
    "@xmath73 ( by eq .  ) , and in particular , @xmath74 these _ _ fundamental equations__@xcite allow for a completely analytical derivation of the secular equation , for a great variety of boundary conditions .",
    "note that because @xmath57 is a @xmath75 matrix , there are at most three independent fundamental equations according to the cayley - hamilton theorem .",
    "any choice of three different integers @xmath59 is legitimate , although the choice @xmath76 seems to yield the most compact expressions for the components of @xmath62 .",
    "for the piezoacoustic ( bleustein - gulyaev ) shear - horizontal wave , the matrix @xmath57 in eq .",
    "is written in compact form using the following quantity , @xmath77 as @xmath78    note that @xmath57 is indeed of the form eq .  .",
    "to express explicitly integer powers of @xmath57 , it proves convenient to use scalar multiples of the matrix @xmath79 , for which the fundamental equations eq .",
    "are also valid .",
    "for instance , the fundamental equations also hold at @xmath80 when @xmath79 is replaced with @xmath81 , @xmath82 respectively , defined by @xmath83 these symmetric matrices are given explicitly by their components , @xmath84 , & &    m^{(2)}_{12 } =      -\\dfrac{\\epsilon_{11}}{e_{15 } } x          + 2\\dfrac{\\epsilon_{11}c_{44}-e_{15}^2}{e_{15}}(1+\\kappa^2 ) ,   \\nonumber \\\\ &      m^{(2)}_{22 } = 4\\epsilon_{11}(1+\\kappa^2 ) , & &    m^{(2)}_{13 } =           \\dfrac{\\epsilon_{11}}{e_{14}e_{15 } } x       - \\dfrac{\\epsilon_{11}c_{44}-e_{15}^2}{e_{14}e_{15}}(1 + 2\\kappa^2 ) , \\nonumber \\\\ &      m^{(2)}_{23 } =            -2\\dfrac{\\epsilon_{11}}{e_{14}}(1 + 2\\kappa^2 ) , & &    m^{(2)}_{33 } =            4\\dfrac{\\epsilon_{11}}{e_{14}^2}\\kappa^2 ,   \\nonumber \\\\ &     m^{(2)}_{14 } =            -\\dfrac{1}{e_{14}}x + 2\\dfrac{c_{44}}{e_{14}}(1 + 2\\kappa^2 ) , & &   m^{(2)}_{24 } =         -\\dfrac{\\epsilon_{11}c_{44}-e_{15}^2}{e_{14}e_{15}}(1 + 2\\kappa^2 ) , \\nonumber \\\\ &    m^{(2)}_{34 } =         2\\dfrac{\\epsilon_{11}c_{44}-e_{15}^2}{e_{14}^2 e_{15}}\\kappa^2 ,   & & m^{(2)}_{44 } =          -4\\dfrac{c_{44}}{e_{14}^2}\\kappa^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath85    now all the required equations and quantities are in place to treat various electrical boundary value problems .      here the surface of the crystal is coated with a thin metallic film , with thickness negligible when compared to the wavelength , and brought to a zero electrical potential .",
    "moreover , the coating still allows the surface to remain free of mechanical tractions",

    "is not valid .",
    "it is given here for completeness and to illustrate one limitation of the fundamental equations approach .",
    "however , as is seen in iv.b , a simple check can be done to realize whether the speed given by an explicit secular equation is valid or not .      in the general case of a non - metallized , mechanically free boundary ,",
    "the tangential component of the electric field and the normal component of the electric induction are continuous across the substrate / vacuum interface .",
    "these continuities lead to the relationship ( e.g.  dieulesaint and royer @xcite p.288 ) , @xmath113^\\text{t},\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is complex .",

    "it turns out that @xmath117 factorizes into the product of @xmath55 and a cubic in @xmath96 which is independent of @xmath55 , while @xmath122 ( resp .",

    "@xmath96 , @xmath55 ) and a polynomial which is quadratic in @xmath96 and linear in @xmath125 .",
    "the resulting secular equation is a sextic in @xmath96 and a cubic in @xmath125 , with the coefficient of the @xmath126 term proportional to the `` metallized secular equation '' and the coefficient of the @xmath127 term proportional to the ( non - valid ) `` open circuit secular equation '' .",
    "it is emphasized again that , as in iii.b , great care must be taken to ensure that the speed given by the secular equation eq",
    ".   leads to a valid solution .",
    "this point is discussed in iv.b .      as a final type of boundary condition ,",
    "consider that the semi - infinite substrate is covered with a metallic film with thickness @xmath128 and conductance @xmath129 , where @xmath128 is assumed to be so small with respect to the acoustic wavelength that the effects of mechanical loading can be neglected .",
    "then the permeability of the region @xmath130 close to the interface is changed from @xmath55 ( see previous subsection ) to @xmath131 ( see royer and dieulesaint@xcite , p. 301 ) , with @xmath132 .",
    "replacing the former quantity with the latter in the previous subsection leads to similar results as above , except that the @xmath118 matrix and the right hand - side of eq .",
    "are now replaced with @xmath133 respectively .",
    "then the secular equation is eq .   where @xmath117 ,  , @xmath121 are appropriately changed .",
