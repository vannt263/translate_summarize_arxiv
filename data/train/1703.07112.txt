    "recent discovery of higgs boson confirmed the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics  @xcite . since then higgs properties have been measured at the lhc and found that they are consistent with the standard model prediction  , besides there has been no sign beyond the standard model in the experiment .",
    "it is widely believed , however , that the standard model is not the ultimate theory .",
    "superstring theory is one of candidates for ` theory of everything ' .",
    "it requires supersymmetry ( susy ) due to consistency , which gives rise to lots of phenomenological consequences beyond the standard model .",
    "for example , it provides a candidate for dark matter , and three gauge coupling constants are unified at grand unification scale .",
    "supersymmetry affects higgs sector too . in susy",
    "another higgs doublet must be introduced for phenomenologically acceptable higgs mechanism to work . in the supersymmetric higgs sector ,",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is induced by renormalization flow of parameters in the higgs sector , which is a solution to the origin of the ewsb since in the sm it is induced by the ad hoc tachyonic higgs mass term . in spite of such a drastic extension ,",
    "the higgs sector in the supersymmetric model reduces to the one in the sm below the electroweak scale when superpartners are much heavier than the electroweak scale . considering the current status , _ i.e. _ , no sign of new particle so far",
    ", this might be the case , and then it might be difficult to observe a clue of supersymmetry even in future collider experiments .",
    "in such a circumstance , it is worth to recall that the observed 125  gev higgs mass can not be explained in susy at tree level .",
    "it is explained by scalar top ( ` stop ' ) loop contribution , for example , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "this fact indicates that stop has an impact on the sm higgs potential at quantum level , which is similar to the higgs sector in classical scale invariant model . in a simple classical scale invariant model sm singlet scalar(s )",
    "are introduced .",
    "they affect the higgs potential at quantum level , which induces the ewsb radiatively . in this framework",
    ", singlet loop determines the curvature of the higgs potential around the minimum , _",
    "i.e. _ , the higgs mass .",
    "although higgs properties , such as mass , production and decay rates at collider experiments , are almost consistent with the sm values , the higgs self - couplings are predicted to significantly deviate from the sm ones  @xcite . while the measurement of the higgs self - couplings is one of main goals of the next generation lepton collider , _",
    "e.g. _ , ilc , the deviation from the sm in the higgs sector can be also probed at the lhc in gauge boson scattering process .",
    "it is pointed out in ref.@xcite that the differential cross sections of longitudinal gauge boson scattering processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 are changed by more than @xmath1(10% ) in the model , which is described by so - called `` off - shell higgs parameter '' .",
    "namely the discrepancy between the classical scale invariant model and the sm can be found in off - shell higgs , for which the longitudinal gauge boson scattering a good probe .    in supersymmetric model",
    ", stops are expected to play a similar role to the singlet scalars . in this letter",
    "we analyze the longitudinal gauge boson scattering in the framework of supersymmetric model . following the analysis in ref.@xcite",
    ", we formulate the leading order amplitudes of the processes and discuss the deviation from the standard model prediction numerically .    in the study we consider stops with a mass of less than a few tev .",
    "such light stop scenario is motivated by naturalness argument , and part of parameter space of the scenario has already been excluded by the direct search at the lhc . in ref.@xcite scalar top pair production is analyzed in both a simplified model and phenomenologically - tempered susy models in conserved r - parity using run 1 data . the updated studies at @xmath4  tev  @xcite have shown that lighter stop mass region @xmath5 is excluded at 95%cl when lightest neutralino mass @xmath6 is less than about 300  gev . on the other hand , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( with @xmath9 ) is still allowed . another possibility is r - parity violation . without r -",
    "parity the lightest neutralino decays to the standard model particles , thus the above analysis can not be applied . in r - parity",
    "violated scenario , where expecially @xmath10 or @xmath11 types with light flavor indices exists , the stop mass below 1 tev is excluded  @xcite . on the other hand , in @xmath12 type r - parity violation , stop lighter than 1 tev has not been excluded  @xcite .",
    "thus , various possibilities are yet to be probed for light stop scenario . the naturalness - inspired light stop scenario in the minimal supersymmetric standard model",
    "will be searched at the lhc with more data ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs.@xcite for recent study )",
    ". the electroweak precision test and future lepton collider may be other powerful options for the light stop search  @xcite .",
    "we show that high energy longitudinal gauge boson scattering is another tool for the indirect search of tev scale stop .",
    "in this letter , we discuss two types of scenarios regarding the origin of the higgs mass in the supersymmetric model :    * higgs mass is explained in the mssm particle contents * other contributions besides the mssm particles make the observed higgs mass    we assume that the other contributions to the higgs mass are provided in higher scale than stop mass , _",

    "supersymmetry gauginos are @xmath16 , and the other superparticles are much heavier . in the present discussion we consider that stops ( and left - handed sbottom )",
    "are also around tev scale .",

    "namely , our discussion comprises the sm - like higgs with scalar top and it is independent of the details of the other sector . in the appendix  [ app : analyticcheck ]",
    "we also discuss @xmath18 case for a reference , which is also useful for a analytic check of the later calculation . in this letter",
    "we do not argue the naturalness in the higgs sector but focus on the consequence of a tev scale stop in the gauge boson scattering .    to define the relevant parameters for the higgs mass",
    ", we give the mssm superpotential along with soft susy breaking terms : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are chiral superfields of third generation left - handed quark doublet , right - handed quark singlet ( tilded fields are their superpartners ) , up - type higgs doublet , and down - type higgs doublet , respectively , and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",

    "we assume that all parameters are real for simplicity . in supersymmetric model ,",

    "this accuracy suffices for leading order analysis of longitudinal gauge boson scattering discussed below . on the other hand , for ( b ) , assuming additional contribution to the higgs quartic coupling at high energy , such as by vector - like matters , we only need to solve the rg equations in @xmath56 in the sm particle contents . in the later analysis",

    "note that eq",

    "@xmath101 scattering has the similar behavior except for a bump , which corresponds to a resonance at @xmath187 in fig.[fig : delta - rs_gpgm ] .",
    "@xmath188 decreases for @xmath189 .",
    "for example , @xmath190 ( @xmath191)% , @xmath192 ( @xmath193)% , and @xmath194 ( @xmath195)% for @xmath174 ( 10 ) tev and @xmath196 for @xmath161 , 1 , and 2 tev with @xmath163 , respectively ( left panel ) .",
    "qualitatively the same behavior is seen for split mass case ( right panel ) .",
    "note that @xmath188 monotonically decreases for @xmath197 .",
    "this is because the real part of tree - level and top - bottom loop amplitudes is positive , meanwhile the dominant term @xmath198 in eq .",
    "is negative , which is destructive in the total amplitude at the high energy range .",
    "regarding @xmath40 dependence , it is seen that @xmath199 gets smaller for @xmath178 similarly to @xmath77 case .",
    "fig.[fig : delta - xt_gpgm ] clarifies the behavior .",
    "it is found that @xmath199 decreases in @xmath200 region , which attributes to the second term on the right - hand side of eq . as explained in @xmath77 case .",
    "thus in both @xmath77 and @xmath101 scattering processes , it would be difficult to observe the deviation from the sm in the parameter space @xmath201 , especially @xmath202 , since @xmath203 is a few % .",
    "in other words , scenario ( a ) is like a `` blind spot '' for tev scale stop search in the longitudinal @xmath0 boson scattering processes . in scenario ( b ) , on the other hand , @xmath204(110% ) deviation is expected for @xmath205@xmath206  tev .",
    "in this letter we have studied high energy longitudinal @xmath0 boson scattering with a light scalar top whose mass is a few hundred gev to a few tev .",
    "they affect the sm higgs potential at quantum level , consequently the deviation from the standard model in longitudinal gauge boson scattering is expected from the equivalence theorem . applying the equivalence theorem ,",
    "we have computed charged nambu - goldstone boson scattering processes and substituted them as high energy @xmath207 scattering processes . in the study",
    "we consider two scenarios , ( a ) higgs mass is explained in the mssm particle contents , ( b ) other contributions besides the mssm particles make the observed higgs mass .",
    "it has been found that @xmath204(110% ) deviation in the differential cross section is predicted depending on stop mass and kinematics . as an example of ( b ) , for @xmath174 ( 10 ) tev and @xmath208 , the deviation in @xmath76 process is 16 ( 28)% and 7 ( 15)% when both left- and right - handed stop masses ( @xmath209 and @xmath210 ) are 0.5 and 1 tev with the mixing parameter @xmath163 , respectively . similarly in @xmath211 it is @xmath212 ( @xmath191)% , @xmath192 ( @xmath193)% but for @xmath213 . for ( a ) , on the contrary , it has been discovered that the deviation gets smaller , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath214 ( @xmath215)% and @xmath215 ( @xmath216)% for @xmath164 tev with the appropriate @xmath40 for @xmath174 ( 10 ) in @xmath76 and @xmath211 , respectively . the same behavior is seen for @xmath217 case .",
    "thus in such a case it would be challenging to see the existence of stop in @xmath218 scattering .",
    "high energy longitudinal gauge boson scattering has started to be measured at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "however , to observe @xmath219 deviation , at least upgraded program , such as high luminosity lhc , would be necessary since the cross section of the scattering processes is small due to gauge cancellation  @xcite . or future circular collider , which is planed to operate at 100 tev center of mass energy , would be more promising for the study of the gauge boson scattering .",
    "in such a high energy experiment , observation of stop or sbottom pair production might be more direct and easy way to observe a clue of the supersymmetry . as mentioned in the introduction , however , there are model dependence in the data analysis , _",
    "e.g. _ , details of the decay modes , or r - parity is conserved or not .",
    "high energy longitudinal gauge boson scattering would be complementary to the direct searches .",
    "we have provided the theoretical ingredients for the numerical study and discuss feasibility for discovery of scalar tops in the longitudinal gauge boson scattering .",
    "the next step will be to perform full simulation for hadron or lepton collider experiments with various energy , for which refs.@xcite are useful .",
    "we leave it to future work .",
    "_ acknowledgements _    we are grateful to kazuhiro endo and yukinari sumino for valuable discussions .",
    "we will check that the @xmath77 and @xmath101 scattering amplitudes reduce to those in the sm in low energy limit by using analytic higgs mass formula for @xmath220 case .",
    "first of all we need to use lagrangian after the following replacement : @xmath221 consequently , the matching conditions are @xmath222\\ , ,     \\label{eq : matching_lambdah_susy } \\\\    & y_t^{\\rm sm}(\\mu_{\\tilde{t}})=\\lambda_t\\sin\\beta ( \\mu_{\\tilde{t}})\\ , .",

    "hereafter we take @xmath140 .",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath101 scattering amplitudes are easily obtained by using the previous result along with the above replacement and matching conditions .",
    "now let us see the low energy limit , @xmath149 ( but @xmath225 ) .",
