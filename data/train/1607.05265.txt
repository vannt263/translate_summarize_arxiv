    "it is well known that thermal evolution of not too cold neutron stars is regulated by the neutrino emission from superdense matter in neutron star cores . in order to model the thermal evolution",
    "one needs the emissivies of many neutrino reactions which can operate and produce an efficient neutrino cooling of these stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "consider , for instance , neutron star cores , which are massive and bulky internal regions of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "they are thought to contain uniform nuclear liquid of density @xmath3 ranged from @xmath4 to @xmath5 @xmath6 , where @xmath7 g  @xmath8 is the density of standard nuclear matter at saturation .",
    "a neutron star core can be divided into the outer core ( @xmath9 ) composed of neutrons ( n ) with some admixture of protons ( p ) , electrons ( e ) and muons ( @xmath10 ) , and the inner core ( @xmath11 ) containing the same particles and possibly other ones ( for instance , hyperons ) .",
    "all constituents of the matter ( n , p , e , @xmath10 , hyperons ) are strongly degenerate fermions .",
    "these particles can participate in many reactions producing neutrinos .",
    "because in half a minute after their birth neutron stars become fully transparent for neutrinos , the neutrinos immediately escape from the star and cool it .",
    "schematically , the neutrino emissivity [ erg  @xmath8  s@xmath12 for any reaction can be written as @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the energy of generated neutrino ( or neutrinos ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 label initial and final states of a system , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 label corresponding states of reacting particles ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote , respectively , total momenta of reacting particles in the @xmath15 and @xmath16 states , with @xmath21 being a one - particle momentum ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are total energies of the particles ( @xmath24 is a one - particle energy ) .",
    "the delta functions take into account momentum and energy conservation in a reaction event .",
    "the factor @xmath25 is @xmath26^{-1}. \\label{e : f}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it contains the product of fermi - dirac functions @xmath27 for particles in the initial states and the product of blocking functions @xmath28 for particles in the final states ; @xmath29 is the chemical potential , @xmath30 the temperature , and @xmath31 the boltzmann constant . in what follows ,",
    "we take into account that neutron star matter is fully transparent for neutrinos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then the chemical potential of neutrinos is zero , @xmath32 , and the approximation of massless neutrinos is excellent .",
    "other initial or final reacting fermions @xmath33 ( which belong to the dense matter ) are assumed to be strongly degenerate particles of any relativity ; their energies @xmath34 and chemical potentials @xmath35 may include or exclude the rest - mass energy , @xmath36 . the quantity @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ e : r ] ) is proportional to the squared matrix element for a given reaction summed over spin states .",
    "finally , @xmath38 is the product of densities of states of all reacting particles  @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it is well known ( e.g. , @xcite ) that calculation of the emissivities ( [ e : r ] ) , reaction rates or related quantities in a strongly degenerate matter is greatly simplified because the main contribution into corresponding integrals comes from narrow thermal energy widths @xmath41 .",
    "accordingly , one can usually employ the so called energy - momentum decomposition detailed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "it consists in fixing lengths of all momenta of strongly degenerate reacting fermions to the corresponding fermi momenta ( @xmath42 ) and values of energies of these particles to the corresponding chemical potentials ( @xmath43 ) in all functions of @xmath44 and @xmath34 which vary smoothly within thermal energy widths in local elements near respective fermi surfaces . then in eq.([e : g ] ) one can set @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the landau effective mass of a fermion @xmath33 at the fermi surface , and @xmath47 is a solid angle element in the direction of @xmath44 .",
    "the integration over particle momenta in eq .",
    "( [ e : r ] ) is then decomposed into the integration over energies d@xmath34 and over solid angles d@xmath48 .",
    "in further calculations of the emisivity @xmath49 one often approximates @xmath37 by its value @xmath50 averaged over orientations of particle momenta .",
    "then the emissivity becomes @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the integral over orientations of all particle momenta placed on respective fermi surfaces , while @xmath53 contains all other terms ( including @xmath54 ) and integration over particle energies .    in a neutron star ,",
    "generated neutrinos have much lower energies and momenta than the particles of the matter ; it is quite sufficient to neglect neutrino momenta in the momentum - conserving delta function in eq .",
    "( [ e : i ] ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) . then the integration over orientations of neutrino momentum is trivial ( e.g. , gives a factor of @xmath55 for an emission of one neutrino ) and will be supposed to be included in @xmath53 .",
    "accordingly , the angular integration in @xmath56 is performed only over orientations of momenta of strongly degenerate fermions @xmath33 of the matter .",
    "the number of these fermions will be denoted by @xmath1 , so that @xmath57 in @xmath56 .",
    "the case of strongly interacting fermions ( nucleons and hyperons in dense nuclear matter ) deserves a comment .",
    "we assume that the system is non - superfluid , i.e. , it is a normal fermi liquid ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "then the one - particle states with well defined energies and momenta refer actually to elementary excitations , called landau quasiparticles . in a strongly degenerate fermi liquid",
    ", quasiparticles form a dilute fermi gas . therefore",
    ", their distribution in momentum space can be well approximated by the fermi - dirac one .",
    "the fermi momenta for quasiparticles coincide with those for real particles .",
    "these properties justify the use of eq .",
    "( [ e : f ] ) . in what follows , by particles in fermi liquids of nucleons and hyperons we will mean quasiparticles .",
    "systems of strongly degenerate particles are also important in many branches of physics .",
    "in particular , we can mention solid state physics ( degenerate electrons in metals and semiconductors ; e.g. , @xcite ) , fermi - liquid systems @xcite as well as nuclear physics ( symmetric nuclear matter in atomic nuclei ) .",
    "it is our aim to consider the angular integrals @xmath56 for reactions involving different particle species with various fermi momenta .",
    "these integrals determine the area of a hypersurface in 3@xmath1-dimensional momentum space which contributes to a given reaction .",
    "the advantage of the integrals @xmath56 is that they are independent of specific interparticle interactions .",
    "they depend only on the total number @xmath1 of reacting particles and on fermi momenta of these particles , @xmath58 ( @xmath33=1,  @xmath1 ) . for simplicity",
    ", we drop the subscript f because all momenta are assumed to be on the fermi surfaces .",
    "the angular integrals @xmath56 appear in many problems of fermi systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some approaches for calculating them are described , for instance by @xcite .    however , there are plenty of cases realized for different fermi momenta .",
    "our aim is practical , to present @xmath56 for all possible cases at @xmath59 .",
    "in particular , these cases correspond to major neutrino reactions in nucleon - hyperon matter of neutron stars .    section [ s : remarks ] outlines a general method for calculating @xmath56 .",
    "sections [ s : n*nd3 ] , [ s : n=4 ] and [ s : n=5 ] present the calculations for @xmath59 . applications for neutrino reactions are briefly discussed in section [ s : applic ] , and we conclude in section [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "let us formulate some general properties of the angular integrals @xmath56 as functions of @xmath1 fermi momenta . since we integrate over all possible orientations of @xmath44 , any inversion @xmath60 does not change @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 this will be our starting expression .",
    "the lengths of fermi momenta , @xmath62 , are treated as given numbers ; physical nature of particle species @xmath33 is of no importance . for the sake of convenience , we enumerate the particles in the order of decreasing fermi momenta , @xmath63    because the delta function in eq .",

    "because of isotropy of momentum space , @xmath68 depends only on @xmath69 ( but not on the direction of @xmath67 ) . using the definition ( [ e : i1 ] )",

    "this equality greatly simplifies calculations of angular integrals because it allows one to consider the reacting particles as two subsystems ( 1 ,  ,  @xmath73 ) and",
    "( @xmath74 ) .",
    "then one can take auxiliary integrals for these subsystems separately , which is simpler than calculate @xmath75 directly . in this case",

    "the detailed calculations require the above results .",
    "the major neutrino processes in neutron star cores can be divided into ( i ) direct urca processes , ( ii ) baryon - baryon bremsstrahlung processes , and ( iii ) modified urca processes .",
    "the approximation of angle - independent squared matrix elements ( section [ s : introduc ] ) for these reactions is usually valid @xcite which justifies our analysis .",
    "direct urca processes are much stronger , than other ones , but have a threshold character ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "any direct urca process switches on once the density exceeds some threshold value , @xmath110 , determined by a given process and a given equation of state of the matter . as a rule , threshold densities @xmath111 lie in the inner cores of massive neutron stars .",
    "if the direct urca processes are allowed , the modified urca and the bremsstrahlung processes are insignificant . some equations of state forbid the onset of direct urca processes at any density of matter in stable neutron stars .",
    "following @xcite , we illustrate the variety of neutrino emission mechanisms in a neutron star core using a model of nucleon - hyperon matter as an example and assuming the presence of @xmath112 and @xmath113 hyperons .",
    "generally , the fermi momenta of constituents of the matter ( n , p , e , @xmath10 , @xmath112 , @xmath114 ) may be rather arbitrary ( e.g. , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for simplicity , we consider the baryons ( n , p , @xmath112 , @xmath114 ) as non - superfluid and assume the presence of beta equilibrium and electric neutrality @xcite .",
