    "the aim of this short note is to point out the presence of certain isolated points of stability within the region of instability of some common implicit numerical methods .",
    "we argue that these points should not be included in the definition of the stability region .",
    "stability properties of a broad class of numerical methods ( including runge  kutta methods , linear multistep methods , or multistep multiderivative methods ) for solving initial value problems of the form @xmath0 can be analyzed by studying the stability region of the method .",
    "when an @xmath1-stage @xmath2-step method ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 fixed positive integers ) with constant step - size @xmath5 is applied to the linear test equation @xmath6 ( @xmath7 fixed , @xmath8 given ) , the method yields a numerical solution @xmath9 that satisfies a recurrence relation of the form @xcite @xmath10 the characteristic polynomial associated with the method takes the form @xmath11 the stability region of the method is defined @xcite as @xmath12 ( in @xcite , @xmath13 is present in the definition instead of @xmath14 ) .",
    "it is known @xcite that @xmath15    [ firstexample ] a linear @xmath2-step method @xcite approximating the solution of the initial value problem can be written as @xmath16 where the @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) numbers are the suitably chosen coefficients of the method , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , and @xmath24 stands for @xmath25 .",
    "the numerical solution @xmath26 approximates the exact solution @xmath27 at time @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath29 we have a one - step method , while for @xmath30 the scheme is called a multistep method .",
    "the method is implicit , if @xmath31 . by setting @xmath32",
    "the associated characteristic polynomial is @xmath33    [ secondexample ] multiderivative multistep methods ( or generalized multistep methods ) extend the above class of methods by evaluating the derivatives of @xmath34 at certain points as well .",
    "for example , a second derivative @xmath2-step method @xcite has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 with @xmath37 , and the method is determined by the @xmath38 ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 real coefficients .",
    "the associated characteristic polynomial is now @xmath41",
    "the characteristic polynomial of the implicit euler method with @xmath42 is @xmath43 . now",
    "@xmath44 because is satisfied vacuously . for @xmath45 , @xmath46",
    "if and only if @xmath47 .",
    "hence @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , @xmath50 , the boundary of @xmath51 .    motivated by the above example ,",
    "let us rewrite @xmath52 in as @xmath53 with suitable polynomials @xmath54 .",
    "the leading coefficient @xmath55 does not vanish identically because of the assumption @xmath56 in , or @xmath20 in examples [ firstexample ] and [ secondexample ] . for implicit methods , @xmath55 is a polynomial of degree at least 1 , so the finite set @xmath57 is non - empty .",
    "besides the implicit euler method , there are plenty of examples of classical implicit numerical methods when all the complex roots of the polynomial @xmath58 have modulus strictly less than @xmath59 for some @xmath60 , hence @xmath61 .",
    "the characteristic polynomial of the @xmath62-step bdf method @xcite is @xmath63 .",
    "its stability region is depicted in figure [ bdf2figure ] .",
    "now @xmath64 , because the unique root of @xmath65 is @xmath66 .",
    "-step bdf method is shown in brown and red .",
    "the red dot is the unique element of @xmath67 .",
    "[ bdf2figure],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    one can easily check that , for example , for several other bdf methods @xcite , implicit adams methods @xcite , or enright methods @xcite ( see figure [ enright3figure ] ) we have the inclusion @xmath68 .",
    "-step enright method ( member of the family presented in example [ secondexample ] ) is shown in brown and red .",
    "now we have @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the two red dots represent the set @xmath68 .",
    "[ enright3figure],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    now we show some consequences of the definition . + * observation 1 .",
    "* when the implicit euler method is interpreted as a runge  kutta method , its stability function is defined as @xmath71 for @xmath72 . by definition ,",
    "the stability region of a runge  kutta method is @xmath73 which set is different from the stability region given in .",
    "we would have a similar discrepancy for example for the trapezoidal method when it is interpreted as a runge  kutta method or as a multistep method with @xmath29 .",
    "+ * observation 2 .",
    "* notice that elements of the set @xmath74 already pose a slight inconsistency in the equivalence , since the order of the recurrence relation corresponding to any @xmath75 is strictly less than @xmath2 , hence @xmath76 can not be chosen appropriately .",
    "moreover , recursions with vanishing leading terms can be quite unstable with respect to small perturbations of the coefficients , which renders the numerical method with this specific step - size @xmath5 practically useless .",
    "as an example , let us consider the second order recursion corresponding to the @xmath62-step bdf method @xmath77 . for @xmath78 , @xmath79 for any starting value @xmath80 , but for small @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the sequence @xmath83 quickly  blows up \" for generic starting values , since the absolute value of one root of the characteristic polynomial @xmath84 is huge .",
    "+ * observation 3 .",
    "* one way to study @xmath51 in the complex plane is to depict the root locus curve corresponding to the method . for methods in example [ firstexample ] ,",
    "@xmath52 is linear in @xmath85 , so @xmath46 implies @xmath86 ( for @xmath87 .",
    "the root locus curve is then the parametric curve @xmath88 with @xmath89 for methods in example [ secondexample ] , the equation @xmath90 is quadratic in @xmath85 and can be solved to obtain two root locus curves @xmath91 corresponding to the method .",
    "the root locus curve or the union of the curves can be plotted to yield information on @xmath92 .",
    "it is often believed that the boundary of the stability region is a subset of the root locus curve .",
    "let us consider an irreducible implicit linear @xmath2-step method , that is , a method of the form with @xmath93 and the polynomials @xmath94 and @xmath95 having no common root .",
    "let @xmath96 denote the unique element of @xmath74 in and suppose that @xmath61 .",
    "then @xmath97 , and this @xmath96 is not part of the root locus curve corresponding to the method .    * proof . * due to irreducibility , we have for some @xmath98 that the function @xmath99 is not constant , where @xmath100 . from the product representation @xmath101 ( valid for @xmath102 ) and from @xmath103 we see that there is a root of @xmath104 that is repelled to infinity as @xmath105 but @xmath102 .",
    "hence @xmath106 is an isolated point of @xmath51 , therefore also an isolated point of @xmath92 .",
    "but the image of the unit circle @xmath107 under the non - constant rational function @xmath108 can not contain isolated points .",
    "@xmath109 + * observation 4 . * due to the presence of the exceptional set @xmath74 , some results on stability regions in the literature are not accurate .",
    "for example , the notion of property c for an algebraic function determined by @xmath110 has been defined in @xcite . in ( * ? ? ? * section v.4 ) it is found that all one - step methods have property c. and indeed , applying proposition 2.7 @xcite to the implicit euler method for example , now we have that @xmath111 and @xmath112 have no common root , and @xmath108 is univalent on the set @xmath113 , so @xmath114 has property c. by corollary 2.6 and ( 2.21 ) of @xcite , @xmath115 . here",
    "@xmath116 , so @xmath117 . on the other hand",
    ", we have seen in that @xmath118 due to definition .",
    "as the above observations show , it seems reasonable from the viewpoint of numerical methods to refine the definition of the stability region as follows , affecting only the class of implicit methods ."
