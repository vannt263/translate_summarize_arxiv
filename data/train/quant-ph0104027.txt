    "in a recent paper @xcite preskill et al . focus on the constraints that quantum operations must fulfill in order to be compatible with relativistic quantum theory .",
    "they introduce the notions of causal , localizable , semicausal and semilocalizable quantum operations for bipartite systems .",
    "the prefix _ semi _ refers to `` directed '' properties , which are not invariant under exchanging alice s and bob s system .",
    "an operation on a bipartite system is called _ semilocalizable _ for alice , if it can be decomposed into two local operations with one way quantum communication from alice to bob as illustrated by figure [ semilocalizable ] : first alice performs a local operation @xmath0 on her system and sends quantum information ( via c ) to bob . then bob performs a local operation @xmath1 on his system , depending on the information he got from alice .",
    "an obvious consequence of this setup is that bob can not send messages to alice : the only possible carrier of information ( quantum or classical ) is the system @xmath2 , which goes from alice to bob .",
    "operations with this property will be called `` _ semicausal _ '' . in other words , if we consider only measurements on alice s output of a semicausal operation , expectations do not depend on bob s initial preparation .",
    "that is , as far as alice is concerned , the device can be described by an operation on her system alone .",
    "the main result of this paper is the proof of the converse of the above remark : if a device allows no signalling from bob to alice ( semicausality ) we can represent it explicitly as a device involving possibly a particle sent from alice to bob but none in the other direction .",
    "_ causality _ and _ localizablility _ are defined as the analogous symmetric properties . from this",
    "it would seem that these are also equivalent ( just use the proof twice , with an exchange of the roles of alice and bob ) .",
    "however , full localizability is defined to be stronger than the two semi - localizabilities : the latter would mean only that there are two representations , each involving only one - way communication , whereas localizability means the absence of all communication .",
    "indeed , in @xcite an example for a causal operation which is not localizable has been given .",
    "thus all proven implications between causal , semicausal , localizable and semilocalizable operations ( including the results of this paper ) can be visualized in the following diagram : @xmath3    as in @xcite , the concepts introduced so far only require the standard setup of quantum information theory , in which `` localization '' is phrased entirely in terms of the hilbert space tensor product of alice s and bob s respective hilbert space .",
    "this kind of localization is a priori unrelated to relativistic locality , and it turns out that for building a fully relativistic quantum theory it is too narrow .",
    "detailed knowledge about the relativistic localization structures has been accumulated during the last three decades in a research programme known variously as `` algebraic quantum field theory '' or `` local quantum physics '' @xcite .",
    "quantum information theoretical aspects have also been studied within this framework ( see e.g. @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "technically , the main change is related to the fact that one has to deal with infinitely many degrees of freedom , and occurs in a similar way when discussing statistical mechanics in the thermodynamic limit @xcite : the observable algebra of a local subsystem can no longer be taken as the operators of the form @xmath4 with respect to some tensor product decomposition of the underlying hilbert space . instead ,",
    "more general von neumann algebras must appear as observable algebras .",
    "we will briefly comment on the changes this introduces in the concepts of localized operations in the last section .",
    "as is well known , physical operations can be described either in the schrdinger picture , by a map acting on states or density matrices or , equivalently , in the heisenberg picture , by an operator acting on observables . in spite of this equivalence ,",
    "however , some things and especially localization properties and the stinespring dilation are stated more easily in the heisenberg picture .",
    "therefore we will work in the heisenberg picture .",
    "we recall some basic notions and notations . in the heisenberg picture an _ operation _",
    "@xcite taking systems with hilbert space @xmath5 to systems with hilbert space @xmath6 is a completely positive operator @xmath7 satisfying @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding map @xmath9 in the schrdinger picture acts on a density matrix @xmath10 on @xmath5 such that @xmath11 the conditions on @xmath12 are equivalent to @xmath9 being likewise completely positive , and satisfying the normalization condition @xmath13 for all density operators @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath9 is even trace preserving ( equivalently : @xmath14 ) , we call the operation non - selective , or a _ channel _ @xcite .",
    "as the name suggests , selective operations typically occur , when part of the operation is a selection of a sub - ensemble according to measuring results obtained by the device .",
    "the four properties in diagram  ( [ arrows ] ) all refer to an operation @xmath12 with @xmath15 .    a completely positive map ( not necessarily a channel ) @xmath16 is called    1 .",
    "_ semicausal _ if it can be written as @xmath17 for all @xmath18 and for some completely positive map @xmath19 .",
    "2 .   _ causal _ if it semicausal in both directions , i.e. if @xmath20 for all @xmath21 @xmath22 and for some completely positive maps @xmath19 and @xmath23 3 .",
    "_ localizable _ if it can be decomposed into @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a channel and @xmath26 a completely positive map .",
    "semilocalizable _ if it can be decomposed into @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a channel , @xmath29 a completely positive map and @xmath30 a finite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we are now prepared to give the proof of the conjecture by divincenzo , of which the special case of complete measurements was treated in @xcite .",
    "* theorem : * _ a completely positive map ( not necessarily a channel ) is semilocal if and only if it is semicausal . _",
    "before going into the proof , we point out some salient facts about the stinespring representation of a completely positive map @xcite .    [ [ the - stinespring - representation ] ] the stinespring representation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the stinespring representation theorem , as adapted to maps between finite dimensional quantum systems , states that any completely positive map @xmath7 can be written as @xmath31 with a linear operator @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a finite dimensional hilbert space , called the dilation space . the representation ( [ stein1 ] ) is called minimal if ( and only if ) the set of vectors @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 spans @xmath37 .",
    "[ [ uniqueness ] ] uniqueness : + + + + + + + + + + +    the main step of the proof will be to get a factorization of the given operation into two operations with suitable localization properties .",
    "it turns out that such a factorization is provided precisely by the uniqueness statement for the stinespring dilation .",
    "we therefore explain this uniqueness in more detail .",
    "suppose that @xmath12 has a minimal stinespring representation ( [ stein1 ] ) as well as a further ( not necessarily minimal ) one @xmath38 with another linear map @xmath39 .",
    "since representation ( [ stein1 ] ) is taken to be minimal , we conclude @xmath40 and the prescription @xmath41 yields a well defined isometry @xmath42 .",
    "this can be easily verified by observing that all scalar products between vectors such as the ones on the right hand side of ( [ dilavec ] ) are fixed by the relation ( [ stein2 ] ) .",
    "from this definition of @xmath43 we find that the intertwining relation @xmath44 holds for each @xmath45",
    ". hence @xmath43 must be decomposable into @xmath46 with an isometry @xmath47 .",
    "if both representations ( [ stein1 ] ) and ( [ stein2 ] ) are minimal the dimensions of the dilation spaces coincide and @xmath48 must be a unitary operator .",
    "the minimal stinespring representation is thus unique up to a unitary transformation .",
    "[ [ kraus - operators ] ] kraus operators : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in most of the current literature the stinespring dilation is used only in the form of a corollary , called the kraus representation of a completely positive map . if we introduce an orthonormal basis @xmath49 of the dilation space @xmath33 and define the `` kraus operators '' @xmath50 by @xmath51 we can write the dilation formula  ( [ stein1 ] ) as @xmath52 for all @xmath53 .",
    "of course , everything we do in this paper could be formulated in terms of kraus operators .",
    "we found this less practical , however , because the above uniqueness statement becomes more involved : the choice of the basis @xmath54 always introduces some arbitrariness , so even in the minimal case the collection of kraus operators is only unique up to a unitary transformation acting on the index @xmath55 .",
    "as noted in the introduction the implication `` semilocalizable@xmath56semilocal '' is trivial . in the notation of section  [ definitions ]",
    "it becomes @xmath57 so ( [ semicausal ] ) follows with @xmath58 .    for the reverse implication , let @xmath16 be a semicausal operation , i.e. an operation fulfilling ( [ semicausal ] ) for some completely positive map @xmath19 .",
    "the stinespring representation of @xmath12 gives us a dilation space @xmath59 and a linear operator @xmath60 , @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 for each @xmath18 and @xmath22 .",
    "analogously we get a dilation space @xmath30 and a linear operator @xmath63 from the minimal stinespring representation of @xmath64 @xmath65 for all @xmath18 . according to the relation ( [ semicausal ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath66 for all @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness of the minimal stinespring representation now implies the existence of an isometry @xmath68 ( see eq .",
    "( [ iso ] ) ) such that @xmath69 and therefore @xmath70 from this we obtain a completely positive unital map @xmath71 by taking @xmath72 for every @xmath22 and a completely positive ( not necessarily unital ) map @xmath73 : @xmath74 for every @xmath18 and @xmath75 .",
    "thus we conclude from ( [ stein ] ) and ( [ compo ] ) that the identity ( [ semilocal ] ) holds . in other words , @xmath12 is semilocalizable .",
    "as already indicated in the introduction , quantum field theory requires a more general setup than the one used in this note and in @xcite .",
    "relativistic localization is then expressed by assigning to every spacetime region the algebra of observables , which can be measured in that region , typically a von neumann algebra .",
    "signal causality then means that whenever two regions are spacelike separated ( no causal signals can be exchanged ) the corresponding algebras commute elementwise .",
    "one might try replacing this by an assignment of `` local hilbert spaces '' to spacetime regions , such that the union of spacelike separated regions corresponds to the hilbert space tensor product .",
    "this is not possible , however , because spacetime regions can be split into finer and finer pieces , and this would create difficulties for the tensor products , especially when the overall hilbert space is required to be separable ( to have a countable orthonormal basis ) , and relativistic invariance is imposed .",
    "surprisingly the von neumann algebras of local regions are all isomorphic under mild axiomatic assumptions .",
    "more specifically they are all isomorphic to the unique hyperfinite type iii@xmath77-factor ( see @xcite for an explanation of these terms , and the proof ) .",
    "nevertheless the localization structure is far from trivial , and resides in the way these algebras are nested into each other .",
    "already for the inclusion of two such algebras an amazing variety is possible .",
    "as might be expected from the heuristic argument at the beginning of this section , the small distance localization structure in quantum field theory deviates dramatically from what would be expected from hilbert space tensor products .",
    "suppose alice and bob operate in spacelike separated regions , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the local von neumann algebras assigned to these regions .",
    "then when the regions are very close together , no physical @xcite product states exist , hence there are no separable states at all .",
    "in fact , all physical states violate the chsh - bell inequality maximally @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if the regions are a finite distance apart , the so - called _ split property _ holds , which is equivalent to the existence of many separable states , or to the possibility for bob to prepare any state of his subsystem locally without disturbing alice s @xcite .",
    "algebraically this means that the von neumann algebra generated by @xmath78 and @xmath79 is isomorphic to the von neumann algebra tensor product @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the notion of _ semicausality _ is easy to express in this context : that @xmath12 maps operators of the form @xmath81 to operators of the same form just means that alice s algebra is invariant in the sense that @xmath82 , or briefly @xmath83 .",
    "it is not so clear what should be understood by _",
    "semilocality_. the reason is that one has to decide what degree of independence should be postulated for the intermediate system @xmath2 , sent from alice to bob in figure  [ semilocalizable ] .",
    "if we require the kind of independence valid for widely separated regions ( split property ) , as suggested by the image of a system being `` sent '' , the theorem is probably false .",
    "although the stinespring decomposition for semicausal maps is well understood , it is not clear what factorizations would be meaningful interpretations of figure  [ semilocalizable ] .",
    "funding by the european union project equip ( contract ist-1999 - 11053 ) and financial support from the dfg ( bonn ) are gratefully acknowledged .                            here",
    "`` physical state '' technically means a `` normal '' state , i.e. , a state which can be represented by a density operator on the hilbert space of the global system , as opposed to `` singular '' states . for the purposes of this discussion it is sufficient to require `` local normality '' ,",
    "i.e. , that the restriction to bounded spacetime regions can be represented in this way . roughly speaking this",
    "requires that no infinite amount of energy needs to be invested in a finite region to prepare the state .",
    "this property allows also temperature states of finite density , which are globally different ( singular ) from the vacuum , but not locally ."
