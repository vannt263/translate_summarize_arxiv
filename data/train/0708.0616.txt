    "potts models on hierarchical lattices have been introduced in 1979 by berker and ostlund @xcite as an interpretation of migdal - kadanoff models , defined in 1975 @xcite in order to approximate classical spin models on @xmath0 .",
    "later , in 1981 , griffiths and kaufman @xcite provided a rigorous definition of hierarchical lattices and studied some examples in detail .",
    "one of such examples , the diamond hierarchical lattice , was later considered in a paper by derrida , de seze and itzykson @xcite , who showed that the generator of the renormalization group ( see e.g. @xcite ) could be written as a rational map acting on the riemann sphere ; as a consequence , the fisher set of the model coincides with the julia ( i.e. unstable ) set of the renormalization group map .",
    "later , similar results were established to study other specific lattices ( e.g @xcite ) or to introduce coupling with an external magnetic field in a similar dynamical framework ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "+ in this paper we generalize the result of @xcite to all hierarchical lattices , i.e. we prove that the generator of the renormalization group of a potts model on a hierarchical lattice can be represented by a rational map acting on a complex multiprojective space ( sections [ hierarchical ] and [ dynproj ] ) . the general approach that we introduce , not only allows to describe all models on hierarchical lattice that have already been studied , but it also provides an extremely natural way to deal with an external magnetic field ( ) . the study of the dynamics obtained by iteration of a rational map in several complex variables is a quite recent research subject and , as such , it is still quite incomplete .",
    "nevertheless , recent results by dinh - sibony @xcite allow us to prove that , at least for some class of hierarchical lattices , lee - yang and fisher sets are a subset of the julia set of the renormalization map ( ) . this paper features two technical appendices that give the basic mathematical background needed to understand the statements in the main part and provide references for the interested reader .",
    "a number of examples of potts models on hierarchical lattices are presented in @xcite , where it is shown how to obtain both exact and numerical results by using the general methods developed in this paper .",
    "in order to state our result in full generality , we need to provide formal definitions and notations for the objects we will use in the paper . in spite of the technical nature of such definitions , they are indeed quite natural and , most importantly , they will lead to a very simple proof of the result",
    ".      _ hierarchical lattices _ ( in short _ _ hl__s ) are lattices that are left invariant by a given coarse - graining operation .",
    "the most famous example is provided by the diamond hierarchical lattice @xcite which is obtained by iterating the substitution which replaces an edge with four edges linking the original vertices with two new ( internal ) vertices ( see , e.g. @xcite , figure 1 or @xcite , figure 1 ) .",
    "our goal is to extend this procedure so as to be able to consider more general cases . to this purpose",
    ", we are going to define hierarchical lattices as limits of sequences of finite objects obtained iterating a _ decoration _ procedure , which is going to be dual to the coarse - graining operation .",
    "the finite objects we consider are a generalization of graph called _ hypergraph _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) ; hypergraphs have been briefly considered in @xcite ( see section v ) under the name of `` generalized graphs '' and they were used for defining hierarchical lattices with multiple spin interactions . in fact , hypergraphs differ from graphs in the sense that edges ( sometimes also called _",
    "hyperedges _ or _ links _ ) are allowed to connect an arbitrary number of vertices .",
    "hereby follows the standard definition .",
    "a hypergraph @xmath1 is defined by a set @xmath2 of vertices and a set @xmath3 of edges that are finite ordered non - empty subsets of @xmath2 ; the same vertex can not appear more than once in an edge .",
    "given an edge @xmath4 , we define _ rank _ of @xmath4 its cardinality @xmath5 as a subset of @xmath2 .",
    "if all edges have the same rank @xmath6 , the hypergraph is said to be @xmath7uniform and @xmath6 is said to be the _ order _ of the hypergraph .",

    "@xmath9 is defined as a hypergraph such that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    from the physical point of view",
    ", edges will connect spins that are coupled to each other ; notice that the definition only takes into account edges of finite rank as we do not consider interactions of infinite range .",
    "we _ do not _ assume that either @xmath2 or @xmath3 are finite .",
    "+ it will be necessary to associate different properties ( e.g. interactions ) to edges of the same rank ; such properties will be indexed by a ( at most ) countable index set @xmath12 ( the set of _ types _ ) that will be common among all hypergraphs ; the notion of _ structured hypergraph _ takes into account this additional piece of information . in order to define it , we first need to introduce the notion of _ partition _ of a hypergraph @xmath8 _ into uniform partial hypergraphs _",
    "@xmath13 , where the _ rank _ @xmath14 and the _ type _ @xmath15 have been fixed .",
    "this partition is obtained as follows : we define @xmath16 to be the set of all edges of @xmath1 with rank equal to @xmath6 and type equal to @xmath17 .",

    "moreover , notice that the domain of the renormalization map @xmath114 is the infinite dimensional space of all interactions ; however , since @xmath63 acts as the identity on all but finitely many edge sets , @xmath114 acts non - trivially on a finite dimensional space only .",
    "if we have a hierarchical lattice @xmath122 generated by the iteration of decoration procedure @xmath63 , then @xmath114 can be iterated on the space of boltzmann weights of @xmath122 and this space will be a finite dimensional complex vector space . as we will see later",
    ", the dynamics of @xmath114 will reflect thermodynamical properties of the potts model on @xmath122 .",
    "when defining the interactions @xmath123 , we can choose the zero of energy for each edge set independently and arbitrarily .",
    "this freedom is reflected by the fact that the physics of the system will not change if we apply the map @xmath124 or , equivalently , , for an arbitrary choice of @xmath125 .",
    "this elementary observation allows us to establish an equivalence relation on each space of boltzmann weights @xmath126 i.e. : @xmath127 equivalent boltzmann weights will give identical physical systems . if we take the quotient of @xmath128 with respect to this equivalence relation , we obtain a _ projective space _ .",
    "thus , the quotient of the space of all boltzmann weights with respect to all such equivalence relations is a product of projective spaces , i.e. a _ multiprojective space _ , that will be called _ dynamical space _ and will be denoted by @xmath129 . given @xmath130 , the dynamical space associated to @xmath105 will be the finite dimensional multiprojective space : @xmath131 notice that , if we have a @xmath30uniform hypergraph @xmath24 , @xmath42 , the dynamical space @xmath132 is a standard complex projective space of dimension @xmath133 .",

    "natural coordinates on the resulting projective space are _ homogeneous coordinates _ of which we recall the definition in [ appa ] .",
    "+ notice that the renormalization map is a well - defined rational map on the dynamical space , since each coordinate given by a separately homogeneous polynomial .",
    "moreover , the dynamical space of a hierarchical lattice is finite dimensional and invariant under the renormalization map .",
    "this means that at most a finite number of new interactions will be generated by the renormalization procedure ; in this sense , potts models on hierarchical lattices are completely renormalizable .",
    "the approach we just presented is particularly convenient for studying the dynamics of the renormalization map , as the dynamical space has now been compactified in a natural way .",
    "all homogeneous thermodynamical quantities ( e.g. susceptibility ) can still be defined using variables in the dynamical space , but in order to define inhomogeneous quantities ( such as free energy ) we need to fix a zero of energy i.e. to consider variables belonging to the linear ( not the projective ) spaces . +",
    "we will now look for invariant ( projective ) subspaces of the dynamical space ; studying the dynamics of the renormalization map in such smaller subspaces is both interesting , as they correspond to special physically symmetric configurations , and convenient , as a map on a lower dimensional space is generally easier to study .",

    "moreover , the requirement of being holomorphic is a technical assumption that can possibly be removed using a more careful definition of the green current .",
    "the connection is nevertheless interesting and it is worthwhile to try to understand how properties of the decoration are related to regularity properties of the corresponding renormalization map . as summarized in the appendix , we need the map to enjoy two main properties in order for the green current to be at least defined : _ dominance _ and _ algebraic stability_. + the dominance property states that the jacobian determinant of the map should not be identically zero .",
    "it is therefore very easy to check if a particular renormalization map enjoy this property ; nevertheless it is interesting to point out that , in general , decoration that present some degeneracies will correspond to non - dominant maps .",
    "we now give two examples of such degenerate decorations :    as a first example consider a decoration such that the renormalization map is _ invariant _ under permutations of @xmath139 ; a 2-decoration suffices to illustrate the fact :        @xmath240    this implies that the image of the map is an algebraic subvariety , that in turn implies that the map is not dominant .",
    "this degeneracy is in some sense _ removable _ as it can be ruled out by naturally restricting the map to the invariant variety which corresponds to @xmath159invariant interactions .    as a second example",
    "consider the following uniform decorated edge :        @xmath241    in this case the 3-spin interactions can be expressed in terms of 2-spin interactions .",
    "clearly the map will not be surjective on the space of 3-spin interactions as it will provide just interactions that can be described by @xmath242edges , which in turn form a subvariety of codimension 1 . in such cases one should again restrict to the appropriate space of interactions to obtain a dominant map .",
    "the other regularity condition we have to check is _ algebraic stability _",
    "; this property is much harder to verify than the dominance condition .",
    "in fact , algebraic stability is related to the growth of the degrees of iterates of the renormalization map .",
    "it may happen that iterating the map we obtain factors that are common to all coordinates and which therefore have to be simplified ; this operation lowers the degree of the map . in the maps studied so far ,",
    "common factors do appear , but only in the definition of the map ( i.e. the first iteration ) ; we believe that once we simplify common factors which are possibly present at the first iteration , the renormalization map should be algebraically stable . also , from a mathematical point of view , it would be quite important to prove algebraic stability for such maps , or at least to find conditions in terms of the decorations in order to ensure that this property holds .",
    "in fact , a characterization of algebraically stable maps is still lacking ; for instance , it is not yet known how to build nontrivial maps that are a priori algebraically stable .    to give an example of the appearance of common factors we consider the model shown in figure [ cayley ] .",
    "the model can be given by a non - uniform decoration ; in this decoration we have two different kinds of one - dimensional edges ( dotted and solid in the picture ) .",
    "the resulting graph is also known as the cayley graph of the free group on 2 generators .",
    "if we are in the case without an external magnetic field , the renormalization map associated to the decoration has common factors .",
    "removing them corresponds to pruning all the branches of the tree and leaving a one - dimensional chain ; this equivalence was observed long ago in @xcite .",
