    "in cellular networks where each base transceiver station ( bts ) independently transmits to mobile stations within its own cell , inter - cell interference is a major limitation on the sum spectral efficiency . rather than treating inter - cell interference as noise",
    ", the modern view is that it can be exploited by coordinating transmissions from the btss .",
    "it is well - known that coordinated transmissions can potentially increase the spectral efficiency dramatically ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "a recent comprehensive review of multicell coordination techniques is given in @xcite and references therein .",
    "there can be different levels of bts coordination .",
    "the basic level is to share channel state information ( csi ) for the direct and interfering channels among the btss . that allows the btss to adapt their transmission strategies to channel conditions jointly , and includes inter - cell joint power control , user scheduling , and beamforming @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite , which consider power allocation and beamforming for peer - to - peer ( interference ) networks . )",
    "these techniques treat the inter - cell interference as noise , but it is mitigated by exploiting the heterogeneity of csi across different users .    a higher level of coordination is multicell joint processing , which requires the cooperating btss to exchange message data in addition to csi @xcite .",
    "interference can be mitigated by using `` virtual '' or `` network '' multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques @xcite , which view all interfering signals as carrying useful information .",
    "although multicell joint processing can potentially provide substantial performance gains , it introduces a number of challenges .",
    "in particular , most coordinated transmission schemes in the literature not only require knowledge of codebooks and perfect csi at all transmitters and receivers , but also require the cooperating transmissions to be aligned in phase so that transmissions superpose coherently at the receivers .",
    "phase - aligning oscillators at different geographical locations is difficult , since small carrier frequency offsets translate to large baseband phase rotations  @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a _ noncoherent _ scheme for downlink cooperation , which does not require phase alignment at the transmitters . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a scenario where two btss cooperatively transmit to two mobiles assigned the same time - frequency resource block , one in each cell as depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : twocells ] .",
    "it is assumed the two btss partially or fully share their messages via a bi - directional dedicated link .",
    "each bts may transmit a superposition of two codewords , one for each receiver .",
    "each receiver decodes only its own message , and treats the undesired signals as background noise . assuming that gaussian codebooks are used to encode all messages , the proposed scheme is simple : the message intended for each receiver is in general split into two pieces to be transmitted by the two btss , respectively .",
    "the rate and power allocations across the messages at each bts are then optimized .",
    "that is , for a given set of channel gains the available power at each bts is divided between a signal used to transmit its own message and a signal used to transmit the message from the other bts .",
    "this cooperative scheme is motivated by scenarios where each bts has no _ a priori _ information about the phase at the other bts .",
    "while the optimal ( capacity - achieving ) cooperative transmission scheme is unknown , and seems to be difficult to determine , the proposed rate - splitting scheme is a likely candidate .",
    "furthermore , it serves as a baseline for comparisons with other schemes in which limited phase information may be obtained .",
    "we optimize the powers allocated across the data streams and associated beamformers with multiple transmit antennas with cooperative transmissions for both narrowband and wideband scenarios . for narrowband channels with a single transmit antenna the frontier of the achievable rate region",
    "is computed by solving a _ linear - fractional program_. the weighted sum rate can be maximized by comparing at most six extremal rate pairs in the constraint set for transmit power . with multiple transmit antennas ,",
    "the achievable rate region can be characterized by maximizing the weighted sum rate over the allocated power and the beamforming vector for each message , and the resulting optimization problem can be solved efficiently by numerical methods .",
    "this noncoherent cooperative scheme often achieves a significantly larger rate region and much higher sum rate than non - cooperative schemes . with wideband ( frequency - selective ) channels ,",
    "the power is allocated over multiple sub - carriers .",
    "maximizing the sum rate is in general a non - convex problem . under mild assumptions ,",
    "however , the dual problem can be solved efficiently .",
    "moreover , we propose a suboptimal power allocation scheme for the case of a single transmit antenna , which admits a simple analytical solution .",
    "this suboptimal scheme performs almost as well as the optimal power allocation when the direct- and cross - channel gains are of the same order .",
    "the optimization problems presented can be easily extended to more than two btss and two mobiles",
    ". however , the structure of the solution becomes more complicated , necessitating general numerical ( convex programming ) techniques .",
    "here we focus on the scenario with two mobiles in adjacent cells since in practice a particular mobile is likely to have only one relatively strong interferer , and coordinating among more than two mobiles across cells becomes quite complicated .",
    "( this complication can be compounded by the scheduler , which may reassign nearby mobiles different time - frequency resources over successive frames . )",
    "finally , the two - mobile scenario provides significant insight into the potential gains of the cooperative scheme .",
    "consider downlink transmission in two adjacent cells each with the same set of narrowband channels .",
    "within each cell , the signals from the bts to its associated different mobiles occupy non - overlapping time - frequency resources ; however , in each time - frequency slot , there can be inter - cell interference . here",
    "we consider two mobiles in adjacent cells assigned the same narrowband channel . assuming a narrowband system with block fading and single transmit antenna at each bts and single receive antenna at each mobile , the baseband signal received by mobile @xmath0 during the @xmath1-th symbol interval is @xmath2 where @xmath3",

    "the rate region frontier may not contain points satisfying the condition @xmath23 . in that case",
    ", the power allocation schemes satisfying @xmath24 must be suboptimal .",
    "however , without knowing the rate pairs on the frontier , we can assume this condition is satisfied and characterize the stationary points , which then serve as candidate points for achieving the maximum weighted sum rate .",
    "this gives two possible frontiers corresponding to the two types of power allocations in table  [ t ] .",
    "namely , one candidate frontier is obtained by fixing @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) and sweeping the value of @xmath20 ( or @xmath27 ) across the interval @xmath28 $ ] ( or @xmath29 $ ] ) .",

    "the actual rate frontier is then the maximum of the two candidate frontiers .",
    "for the first candidate frontier we have @xmath33 examining @xmath34 , the maximizing value @xmath35 is the solution to the quadratic equation @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath40 , the smaller root is the solution .",
    "it is easy to check that if @xmath41 , @xmath4 , and @xmath42 satisfy @xmath43 and @xmath44 , then @xmath35 achieves the maximum @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , we could fix @xmath26 and optimize over @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting necessary conditions show that if @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) , then maximizing over @xmath20 ( or @xmath27 ) gives a candidate stationary point , as stated in proposition  [ pr : stationary ] .",
    "a similar argument shows that if @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) , then maximizing over @xmath18 ( or @xmath32 ) gives a second candidate stationary point on the frontier .",
    "if @xmath47 , then @xmath48 , which implies that @xmath49 ( if it is real ) . it can be similarly verified for the other cases that there are no valid stationary points in the interior of the power constraint set , which establishes proposition [ pr : miueq1 ] .",
    "the preceding propositions state that the maximum weighted sum rate can be efficiently determined by searching over the small number of candidate power allocations shown in table  [ t ] . this will be used as the basis for optimizing wideband power allocations discussed in the next section .",
    "we now consider a wideband system with frequency - selective channels .",
    "a wideband channel is modeled as a set of @xmath50 discrete ( parallel ) channels .",
    "each sub - channel is modeled similarly as ( [ eq : recsig1 ] ) , with the same csi known at the terminals . instead of one power constraint for each sub - channel ,",
    "the @xmath50 sub - channels are subject to a total power constraint at each bts .",
    "the problem is to maximize the weighted sum across users of the rates summed across sub - channels :      where @xmath52 denotes the sub - channel index , @xmath53 denotes the power allocated to sub - channel @xmath52 , and @xmath54 denotes the total power constraint at bts @xmath5 .",

    "note that the rate objective includes only the corner points and does not explicitly include the interior points ( stationary points ) .",
    "however , the interior points are implicitly included in the rate objective due to the power optimization at the upper level .",

    "problem ( [ eq : problem2 ] ) is non - convex in general because of the non - convexity of the objective function .",
    "however , letting the number of sub - carriers within a given band @xmath65 go to infinity , we can assume that @xmath66 converges to a continuous function of frequency @xmath67 , and the corresponding continuous optimization problem can be efficiently solved numerically .",
    "the continuous optimization problem can be formulated as    [ eq : problem3 ] @xmath68    where the index @xmath52 is replaced by the continuous variable @xmath69 .    _ definition @xcite : _ consider the general optimization problem :    @xmath70    [ eq : timesharing ]    where @xmath71 are the optimization variables , each function @xmath72 is not necessarily concave , and each function @xmath73 is not necessarily convex .",

    "the time - sharing condition essentially states that the optimal value of the objective in ( [ eq : timesharing ] ) is concave in @xmath74 .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that if the time - sharing condition is satisfied , then the optimization problem has zero duality gap , i.e. , solving the dual problem gives the same optimal value as solving the primal problem even if it is not convex .",
    "since @xmath84 is continuous in @xmath69 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are continuous in @xmath69 , and the integrand of the objective function is continuous in @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , we can apply the techniques used in the proof of theorem 2 in @xcite to show that this optimization problem satisfies the time - sharing condition .",
    "then the optimization problem ( [ eq : problem3 ] ) has zero duality gap and for this problem solving its dual is more efficient .",
    "the solution to problem ( [ eq : problem3 ] ) approximates the solution to ( [ eq : problem2 ] ) and it becomes more accurate as @xmath87 . in practical systems with a large number of sub - carriers , the channel gains between consecutive sub - carriers are typically highly correlated .",
    "hence we expect that the time - sharing condition is approximately satisfied for ( [ eq : problem2 ] ) , so that the solution to the dual problem will be nearly - optimal .",

    "the dual optimization problem associated with problem ( [ eq : problem2 ] ) is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the dual objective function .",
    "compared with numerically solving the primal problem ( [ eq : problem2 ] ) directly , two properties of the dual problem lead to a reduction in computational complexity .",
    "one is that for any fixed @xmath92 , the solution to ( [ eq : dual ] ) can be computed per - sub - carrier since ( [ eq : dual ] ) can be decomposed into @xmath50 parallel unconstrained optimization problems .",
    "note that for each sub - carrier an exhaustive search for the optimal @xmath53 must be carried out .",
    "the other property is the dual problem is convex in the variables @xmath92 , which guarantees the convergence of numerical methods . in the numerical results that follow we solve the dual optimization problem efficiently via a nested bisection search over @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "( an outer loop updates @xmath93 and an inner loop updates @xmath94 . )",
    "if the required accuracy of each @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 , then the overall computational complexity of the bisection search is @xmath97 , which is linear in @xmath50 @xcite .      at high signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) , we have @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 , since @xmath101 and @xmath102 are interference - limited .",
    "hence we can simplify problem by maximizing over only @xmath103 , @xmath100 , in the integrand of the rate objective .",
    "the corresponding suboptimal power allocation problem can be written as @xmath104 subject to ( [ eq : problem3con ] ) .",
    "this is still a two - level optimization problem .",
    "the lower level selects the better mac channel from the two options for each sub - carrier , and the upper level distributes the power to each sub - carrier subject to the total power constraint .",

    "can be efficiently solved as described in the last subsection ( via its dual problem ) ; however , it turns out that under some mild conditions it can be transformed into a convex program so that standard efficient numerical techniques can also be applied .",
    "specifically , we solve this problem by finding a convex function that upper bounds @xmath110 + @xmath111 , and optimizing this upper bound over the power allocations .",
    "it can be shown that substituting the optimized power allocation for the upper bound into the original objective in ( [ eq : problem4 ] ) gives the same value as the optimized upper bound .",

    "the optimal power allocation is not unique only for the preceding case c. assuming the joint distribution of the channel gains is continuous ( e.g. , rayleigh fading ) , this happens with probability zero .",
    "therefore with probability one the optimal power allocation is unique and is determined by the first two conditions .",
    "the optimal power control scheme implies that only one bts is assigned to transmit at any given @xmath69 , i.e. , the bts with relatively stronger direct- or cross - channel gains .",
    "the two - level water - filling structure of the power allocation indicates that orthogonal transmission is optimal and the gain of the cooperative scheme as considered here in the wideband channel comes from cell selection for each sub - channel , since for each sub - channel at most one link among the four direct- and cross - links between btss and mobiles is activated .",
    "it is straightforward to show that substituting the optimized @xmath117 and @xmath118 in the objective in ( [ eq : problem4 ] ) gives the same result as substituting those functions into the corresponding upper bound @xmath122 .",
    "this is because the solution states that only one bts transmits at any given @xmath69 . since @xmath117 and @xmath118 maximize the upper bound , they must also maximize the original objective .",
    "we observe that @xmath123 $ ] is a kkt point for problem ( [ eq : problem4 ] ) .",
    "this is because when substituting @xmath123 $ ] into the four rates listed in ( [ eq : rc1])([eq : rnc ] ) , the maximum value among the four rates is equal to the maximum value of the two cooperative rates in ( [ eq : rc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rc2 ] ) . since @xmath123 $ ] is a kkt point for problem ( [ eq : problem4 ] )",

    "the solutions to the two problems may not be the same .",

    "also shown is the rate pair achieved with zero - forcing transmission at each bts without cooperation , i.e. , bts @xmath5 transmits to its own associated mobile @xmath5 with the orthogonal projection @xmath185 .",
    "the figure shows that for this example bts cooperation gives substantial gains in @xmath186 when @xmath187 is small .      in a wideband system with frequency - selective channels that are modeled as a set of @xmath50 discrete channels ,",
    "the cooperative beamforming and power control problem is given by      where @xmath189 is given by ( [ eq : beamrk ] ) , the channel gains @xmath190 , angles @xmath191 , and the powers depend on @xmath52 , and the power constraints in ( [ eq : beamcon2 ] ) are satisfied with equality due to proposition [ propbeam ] .    as for a single antenna",
    ", this is again a two - level optimization problem . the lower level optimizes the beamforming vectors to maximize the weighted sum rate for each sub - channel given the power allocated to each message . the upper level then optimizes the power allocation across sub - channels for each message subject to the total power constraints .",
    "similar to the previous case with a single transmit antenna , the dual problem associated with problem ( [ eq : problem1bf ] ) can be formulated where the lagrangian also depends on the angels @xmath192 .",
    "( we omit the details due to space limitations . ) as before , letting the number of sub - channels within a given band tend to infinity , we can assume that @xmath66 and @xmath193 converge to continuous functions of frequency @xmath69 .",

    "the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ f : m_antenna ] were generated by solving the discrete version in ( [ eq : problem1bf ] ) using a nested bisection search for @xmath92 , where the maximization of the lagrangian function in the inner loop is performed over the angles @xmath196 .    in fig .",

    "the four channel vectors on each sub - carrier undergo independent rayleigh fading , and for each link the channel vectors across sub - carriers are assumed to have correlation coefficients of @xmath126 .",
    "the figure compares achievable rates for the following scenarios : 1 ) optimized power assignments across sub - carriers and both btss according to ( [ eq : problem1bf ] ) ; 2 ) cooperative transmission between btss with equal power assignments across sub - carriers ; 3 ) joint beamforming between btss but without message sharing , in which case each bts transmits to its associated mobile in the null space of the cross - channel to the other mobile @xcite",
    ". the achievable downlink sum rate of perfect bts cooperation with phase alignment is also included for comparison . fig .",
    "[ f : widebeam ] shows results with equal - variance direct- and cross - channel gains , and fig .",
    "[ f : widebeam_3db ] shows results for the case where the cross - channel gains are 3 db weaker than the direct - channel gains .    the results in fig .",
    "[ f : widebeam ] show that the cooperative scheme considered offers approximately 4 db gain relative to the non - cooperative joint beamforming scheme presented in @xcite .",
    "also , cooperation with wideband power allocation offers one db gain with respect to equal power allocation .",
    "the cooperative scheme achieves the same number of degrees of freedom as with phase alignment ( which is two since there are two single - antenna mobiles ) at the expense of adding one more antenna at each bts .",
    "the performance improvement due to cooperation diminishes if the average cross - channel gains become weaker than the direct gains , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : widebeam_3db ] .",
    "we have presented a two - cell cooperation scheme with message sharing between btss , which does not require transmissions to be phase - aligned . with a single antenna at the btss and mobiles ,",
    "the rates are maximized by optimizing the power allocation across messages , and also sub - channels in the wideband scenario .",
    "the scheme provides large gains with respect to non - cooperative ( single cell ) power optimization , but gains with respect to cooperative power allocation across the two btss without message sharing are relatively modest , although they can be significant , especially at low snrs .",
    "the gains are primarily due to cell selection , so that they are most pronounced when the cross - channel gains are comparable with direct - channel gains .",
    "we also extended our results to cooperative joint beamforming with message sharing .",
    "this can provide more degrees of freedom compared to the single transmit antenna case , but the gains due to message sharing are again relatively modest .",
    "finally , the absence of phase alignment , as assumed here , reduces the achievable degrees of freedom in the high - snr regime relative to perfect phase alignment .",
    "fundamental limits ( e.g. , achievable rate region or degrees of freedom ) of the broadcast channel considered without transmitter phase alignment , as well as schemes that exploit partial phase information are left for future work .",
    "we rewrite ( [ eq : rk ] ) as @xmath197 first , we consider the case @xmath198 .",
    "we will verify that @xmath199 and @xmath200 by contradiction .",
    "suppose @xmath201 .",

    "hence @xmath200 must hold at the optimum .",
    "similarly , it can be shown that @xmath199 .    if @xmath217 , then the optimal power allocation scheme is not unique .",
    "suppose there exists a solution that satisfies @xmath201 , then we can choose @xmath202 and @xmath218 to satisfy ( [ eq : deltap ] ) and @xmath219 then by the preceding argument , the new power allocation @xmath206 and @xmath207 must achieve the same rate as @xmath18 and @xmath27 . as a consequence",
    ", there exists an optimal power allocation in which the power constraints at both btss are satisfied with equality .",
    "we now consider @xmath23 and show that @xmath220 and @xmath221 by contradiction .",
