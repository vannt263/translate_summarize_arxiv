    "very recently , the besiii collaboration reported a charged charmoniumlike structure by studying the @xmath6 invariant mass spectra in @xmath7 at @xmath8 gev @xcite .",
    "this newly observed charged structure around 3.9 gev is referred to @xmath9 , which was confirmed by the belle collaboration @xcite .",
    "later , xiao _ et al . _ also announced the observation of @xmath9 with a 6@xmath10 significance by analyzing 586 pb@xmath11 data collected with the cleo - c detector at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "as indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this charged enhancement structure near the @xmath1 threshold was predicted in refs .",
    "@xcite before the observation of @xmath9 . among these pioneering theoretical investigations ,",
    "the _ initial single pion emission _ ( ispe ) mechanism was applied to study the hidden - charm dipion decays of higher charmonia , where there exist the charged charmoniumlike structures near the @xmath1 and @xmath2 thresholds in the distributions of the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 invariant mass spectra @xcite .",
    "the ispe is a decay mechanism peculiar to the hidden - charm dipion decays of higher charmonia @xcite and the hidden - bottom dipion decays of higher bottomonia @xcite .",
    "the ispe mechanism was first proposed to explain why the charged bottomoniumlike structures @xmath16 and @xmath17 exist in the @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) invariant mass spectra of the hidden - bottom decays of @xmath22 , which was reported by belle @xcite .",
    "the authors adopted the ispe mechanism further to study hidden - bottom decays of @xmath23 @xcite , and predicted the charged bottomoniumlike enhancement structures similar to @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "recently , we have developed the ispe mechanism to propose the _ initial single chiral particle emission _",
    "( ische ) mechanism , where the charged charmoniumlike structures with the hidden - charm and open - strange channel were predicted @xcite .",
    "although we have already presented abundant phenomena of charged charmoniumlike / bottomoniumlike structures in the hidden - charm / hidden - bottom dipion decays of higher charmonia / bottomonia , it is not the end of the story .",
    "the fact that besiii confirmed our prediction @xcite again provokes our interest into predicting more novel charged charmoniumlike structures in other processes , which can be accessible at future experiments , especially at besiii , belle , and the forthcoming belleii .    in this work ,",
    "we notice the similarity between properties of @xmath0 and @xmath24 . as the first charmoniumlike structure reported in the @xmath25 process ,",
    "@xmath24 was observed by babar @xcite .",
    "later , both the cleo and belle collaborations confirmed @xmath24 in the @xmath25 process @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 was reported by babar @xcite after analyzing the @xmath26 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath27 , which was confirmed by belle @xcite . at present , @xmath9 was observed in the @xmath13 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath28 .",
    "the similarity between @xmath0 and @xmath24 just mentioned above provides us interest in studying whether a similar charged charmoniumlike structure can be found in @xmath29 and other hidden - charm dipion decays of @xmath0 . to answer to this question ,",
    "we need to carry out a more in - depth study of the hidden - charm dipion decays of @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction , we present the hidden - charm dipion decays of @xmath0 discussed above and the calculation of the corresponding decay amplitudes and the differential decay widths . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , the numerical results are given .",
    "the last section devoted into a short summary .",
    "the involved hidden - charm dipion decays of @xmath0 include : @xmath30_{d^{(*)}}^\\mp\\to \\left\\ {   \\begin{array } { l } j/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-\\\\ \\psi(2s ) \\pi^+\\pi^-\\\\h_c(1p)\\pi^+\\pi^- \\end{array } \\right . , \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is an initial single pion directly emitted from @xmath0 decay .",
    "with the pion emission , @xmath0 transits into intermediate @xmath32 . then , via the exchanged @xmath33 meson , the intermediate @xmath32 can dissolve into a charmonium plus a pion . in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , the subscript and superscript of @xmath34_{d^{(*)}}^\\mp$ ] denote the total charge of the intermediate charmed mesons and the corresponding exchanged charmed meson .",
    "these processes can be represented by the typical diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : typical ] .",
    "here , the initial single pion emission plays an important role to these processes , i.e. , because the pion carries off some of the @xmath35 value , the intermediate @xmath33 and @xmath36 with low momenta can easily interact with each other and transit into final states .",
    "these typical diagrams reflect main physical picture of the ispe mechanism @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the results listed in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] indicate :    \\(1 ) for @xmath29 , there are two sharp peaks existing in the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "the one is around the @xmath1 threshold while another one is close to the @xmath2 threshold ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ( d ) and ( g ) ) .",
    "there are two broad structures , which are the corresponding reflections of these two sharp structures .",
    "\\(2 ) the line shapes of @xmath37 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath38 show different behavior from ( 1 ) .",
    "the intermediate @xmath39 can not result in sharp peak structures , instead there is a smooth curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ( e ) ) .",
    "when including only @xmath2 as the intermediate state , we find that a small peak exists although the peak near the @xmath2 threshold and its reflection form one peak as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ( h ) .",
    "\\(3 ) for the @xmath40 process , one irregular peak exists in the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum if only considering the intermediate @xmath39 contribution ( see diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ( f ) ) .",
    "the intermediate @xmath2 contribution can produce a sharp peak near the @xmath2 threshold ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ( i ) ) .",
    "its reflection is a broad structure , which is around the @xmath1 threshold . comparing with the sharp peak structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ( d ) , the peak in fig . [ fig : result ] ( f ) is more obvious .",
    "in addition , our calculation also shows that the intermediate @xmath41 contribution to @xmath42 can not result in any enhancement structure close to the @xmath41 threshold in the @xmath43 invariant mass spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ( a)-(c ) ) .",
    "since we only focus on the line shapes as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] , the uncertainties of the coupling constants can not result in the changes of our results . as for the @xmath44 process via the intermediate state @xmath1 as an example , a common factor @xmath45 can be extracted from the total decay amplitude , which is due to the constraint from eqs .",
    "( [ couple1])-([couple3 ] ) .",
    "thus , the uncertainties of gauge coupling constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 can not change the corresponding line shapes in the @xmath13 invariant mass spectrum .    indeed ,",
    "although in our calculation we use the relations of the coupling constants that are obtained in the heavy quark limit , our qualitative conclusion does not depend on these relations but on the ispe mechanism .",
    "heavy quarkonium physics is an intriguing and active research field full of challenges and opportunities @xcite .",
    "a newly observed charged charmoniumlike structure @xmath9 was reported by besiii @xcite and confirmed by belle @xcite in the @xmath28 process . before the besiii s observation",
    ", we have explored the hidden - charm dipion decays of @xmath24 and have predicted charged charmoniumlike structures by the ispe mechanism @xcite .    stimulated by the similarity between @xmath0 and @xmath24 and the recent experimental observation of @xmath9 by the besiii and belle collaborations , we study the hidden - charm dipion decays of charmoniumlike state @xmath0 in the present work .",
    "our calculation shows that there exist charged structures in the @xmath3 invariant mass spectrum , which are near the @xmath1 and @xmath2 thresholds ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ( a ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "a peak structure around the @xmath2 threshold appears in the @xmath4 invariant mass spectrum ( see fig . [",
    "fig : result ] ( e ) ) .",
    "in addition , we can also find a sharp peak structure in the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum near the @xmath2 threshold ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : result ] ( f ) ) .    experimental search for these charged charmoniumlike structures predicted near the @xmath1 and @xmath2 thresholds is an interesting research topic , which will be helpful to further test our predictions presented in this work .",
    "what is more important is that the ispe mechanism existing in the hidden - charm / hidden - bottom dipion decays of higher charmonium / bottomonium can be tested again .",
    "besiii , belle , and forthcoming belleii will be a good platform to carry out the experimental study on these hidden - charm dipion decays of charmoniumlike state @xmath0 .",
