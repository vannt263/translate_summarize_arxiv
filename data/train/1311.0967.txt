    "next we explain how the update depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mainstep ] is performed in 4 steps .",
    "_ step 1 _ of the update is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : step21 ] .",
    "it corresponds to the reduction of a section of the mps to a charge - conserving matrix @xmath394 , @xmath395 obtained by fusing indices and contracting tensors together as depicted at the top of fig .",

    "since indices carry both charge and degeneracy , we employ generalized fusion tensors @xmath372}}$ ] and @xmath373}}$ ] [ fig .",
    "[ fig : ntensor ] ] to fuse indices as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : step21 ] .",
    "a fusion vertex @xmath396 is inserted to reverse the orientation of @xmath397 prior to fusion with @xmath398 .",
    "the aforementioned fusion of indices and the index reversal is undone in step 3 .",
    "this can be understood as employing a resolution of identity , @xmath399 where , for example , transformation @xmath400 comprised of the reversal of @xmath397 and the fusion of charges @xmath398 and @xmath401 is enacted in this step and the corresponding @xmath402 is enacted in step 3 .",
    "each block @xmath403 of @xmath394 is determined independently by fixing charge @xmath40 on the open indices and summing over all compatible internal charges and their respective degeneracy indices . for fixed compatible internal charges , the tensors of the mps",
    "decompose into degeneracy and fusion parts according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) , and as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : anyonicmps ] . by construction the generalized fusion tensors @xmath372}}$ ] and @xmath373}}$ ] also decompose into degeneracy and fusion parts as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ntensor ] .",
    "thus , for fixed charges on all indices the entire contraction decomposes into two parts as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : step21 ] , namely , a part made of only degeneracy tensors and a fusion network made of only fusion tensors .",
    "the degeneracy tensors are contracted to obtain a matrix @xmath404 .",
    "the fusion network encodes the fusion contraints on the entire contraction , and vanishes when some of the charges are incompatible with fusion rules . for compatible charges",
    "the fusion network can be replaced by a single fusion vertex @xmath405 multiplied by a factor @xmath406 , @xmath407 by applying @xmath44-moves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : threeanyons ] ) and contracting loops [ fig .",
    "[ fig : twoanyons](iii ) ]",
    ".    matrix @xmath404 is then multiplied by the factor @xmath406 .",
    "the above procedure is repeated for all compatible internal charges , and the matrices @xmath404 thus obtained are summed together to obtain the total ( degeneracy ) block @xmath403 . by iterating over all different charges @xmath40 ,",
    "all blocks @xmath403 of matrix @xmath394 are determined .",
    "figure [ fig : step22 ] depicts the remaining steps 2 - 4 of the local update .",
    "the figure shows each step both in terms of the full charge - conserving tensors ( in the left column of each box ) and as it is actually performed by decomposing tensors into degeneracy and fusion parts ( in the right column of each box ) . addressing each in turn :    , width=330 ]      _",
    "step 3 _ is to reorganize matrices @xmath281 and @xmath413 into three - index tensors @xmath414 and @xmath415 respectively .",
    "this is achieved by contracting @xmath281 and @xmath413 with generalized fusion tensors @xmath373}}$ ] and @xmath372}}$ ] respectively as shown .",

    "then by applying an @xmath44-move the two fusion vertices can be replaced by a single fusion vertex multiplied by a factor @xmath417 , @xmath418 this factor @xmath417 is multiplied into the reorganized tensor @xmath415 .",

    "finally , we make some remarks pertaining to a practical software implementation of the anyonic tebd algorithm .",
    "first , for an anyon model with a finite number of charges , there are only a finite number of fusion networks that appear in step 1 of the anyonic tebd algorithm .",
    "these fusion networks depend only on the anyon charges and can therefore be enumerated and the factors @xmath406 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : step21 ] ] may be computed _ prior _ to executing the algorithm for the given hamiltonian .",
    "this saves the cpu time that is otherwise expended to compute the same factors @xmath406 in each iteration of the tebd algorithm .",
    "second , each block @xmath403 is determined _ independently _ by fixing different values of charge @xmath40 on the open indices and summing over all compatible internal charges .",
    "this fact can be exploited in the software implementation to parallelize the contractions in step 1 that correspond to different values of @xmath40 .",
    "in this appendix we discuss some generalizations of the anyonic mps formalism that is presented in this paper . the formalism can be readily extended    1 .   to study lattice models with global onsite symmetry ( appendix  [ ssec : symmetrygroup ] ) , and 2 .   to study anyon lattice models with 1 .",
    "auxiliary degrees of freedom on the lattice sites ( appendix  [ ssec : supplementary ] ) , and/or 2 .",
    "fusion multiplicities ( appendix  [ ssec : fusionmult ] ) .      the basic data @xmath295 , listed in the previous section , which characterize an anyon model may also be used to describe properties of a regular symmetry group @xmath296 where the charges correspond to the irreps of @xmath296 .",
    "_ example 1 : _ consider an abelian lie group @xmath421 u(1 ) . charges ( irreps ) of u(1 ) are labelled by integers @xmath422 and have dimension 1 .",
    "the fusion rules are @xmath423 the @xmath281 and @xmath44 coefficients are trivial for u(1 ) ( and for any abelian group ) .",
    "that is , all @xmath281 and @xmath44 coefficients are equal to 1 for compatible charges and equal to 0 otherwise .",
    "_ example 2 : _ consider the non - abelian group @xmath421 su(2 ) .",
    "charges of su(2 ) are labelled by non - negative semi - integers @xmath424 .",
    "the dimension of charge @xmath422 is equal to @xmath425 .",
    "the fusion rules are @xmath426 the @xmath281-coefficients are given by @xmath427 the @xmath44-move coefficients correspond to the 6-j symbols of the su(2 ) .    by furnishing the data @xmath295 from a symmetry group @xmath296 , the anyonic mps",
    "can be used to represent states of a lattice system that are invariant or , more generally , covariant under the action of an onsite global symmetry @xmath296 on the lattice .",
    "( an onsite global symmetry means that the symmetry group acts identically on each site of the lattice . ) for example , in the context of lattice spin systems , a global onsite symmetry @xmath428 may correspond to invariance of total spin under an identical rotation of all spins .",
    "an anyonic mps constructed from the fusion data furnished from @xmath429 su(2 ) ( as per example 2 ) describes states of the lattice that have a well defined total spin .",
    "thus , the implementation of anyonic constraints in the mps is closely related to and generalizes , the implementation of global onsite symmetry constraints in the mps , as discussed in ( for example ) ref .  .      in secs .",
    "[ sec : one ] and [ ssec : heisenberg ] we illustrated our anyonic mps formalism in the context of a lattice system made up of sites that are populated by a single type of anyon .",
    "however , our formalism can also be applied to the case where lattice sites contain supplementary degrees of freedom that may or may not be described by an anyon model . for instance , consider a lattice where each site @xmath8 corresponds to an anyon @xmath151 and a @xmath430dimensional spin .",
    "the anyonic mps formalism can be extended for such lattice systems in a rather straightforward way by treating the spin degree of freedom on each site as the degeneracy of the anyon @xmath151 .",
    "that is , each site of the lattice is described by a basis @xmath431 where the degeneracy index @xmath432 takes values @xmath433 . by making this identification , the anyonic mps formalism as described in this paper can be applied to study anyon @xmath434 spin lattice systems .",
    "more generally , the lattice sites may contain supplementary degrees of freedom that correspond to charges described by a different anyon model or a global symmetry group @xmath296 . in this case each site @xmath8 is described by a basis @xmath435 where @xmath151 is an anyon charge , @xmath436 is another anyon charge ( or a symmetry charge ) and @xmath437 is a degeneracy index .",
    "our formalism can be applied to this scenario by treating the pair @xmath438 as a _",
    "composite _ charge .",
    "the fusion rules and multiplicity tensor @xmath39 , the @xmath281-coefficients , and the @xmath44-move coefficients for the composite charges @xmath439 can be derived from the corresponding data for the individual charges @xmath16 and charge @xmath422 : @xmath440 @xmath441 an application of the anyonic mps to such a scenario is illustrated in sec .",
    "[ ssec : hubbard ] in the context of the anyonic hubbard lattice model where each site is described by a composite charge @xmath439 ; @xmath16 is an anyon charge and @xmath422 is a u(1 ) charge associated with the number of mobile anyons on the site .      in certain anyon models , multiplicities @xmath38 of fusion outcomes [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : fusionrules ] ) ] can be greater than 1 .",
    "non - trivial multiplicities can be accomodated in the anyonic mps formalism simply by appending a multiplicity label @xmath442 to the anyon charges output by a fusion .",
    "the @xmath281 and @xmath44 coefficients are then augmented by a multiplicity index , @xmath443 ( strictly , charges @xmath16 , @xmath74 , and @xmath40 are also supplemented by a multiplicity index but the values of the @xmath281 and @xmath44 tensors are independent of the values of these extra indices . )",
    "the treatment of fusion multiplicities is very similar to the treatment of _ degeneracies _ of anyonic charges discussed above in the context of the mps formalism . however , whereas the degeneracy index discussed above enumerates the different labellings of ( a portion of ) the fusion tree which yield the same total charge , the multiplicity index enumerates multiple copies of an output charge generated by a single labelling of the fusion tree .",
    "the most general anyonic tensor therefore carries three labels on each leg corresponding to charge , multiplicity , and degeneracy .",
    "the multiplicity index has been suppressed throughout this paper , and should not be confused with the number index appearing in eq .",
