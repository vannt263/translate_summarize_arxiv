    "the fracture process in disordered materials is a subject of intensive research and has attracted much scientific and industrial interest @xcite .",
    "the fracture process is extremely sensitive to disorder , which may act as obstacles difficulting the propagation of cracks through the material .",
    "thus , disorder has a strong influence on the roughness of the fracture surface .",
    "several computational models have been constructed to study the phenomenon of fracture of these materials , such as , the extensively studied fuse @xcite and the well - known fiber bundle models @xcite , created from the pioneer work of daniels @xcite .",
    "experiments have shown that the fracture surface in disordered materials can often be described by self - affine scaling @xcite . in this case , the roughness of the fracture profile can be characterized by a roughness exponent @xmath1 .",
    "some experimental works have claimed that the roughness exponent @xmath1 has a universal value of 0.8 @xcite .",
    "however this universality was questioned by milman _",
    "et al_. @xcite , which experimentally found a roughness exponent closer to 0.5 . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", numerical models have been searched in order to evaluate the roughness exponent @xmath1 .",
    "simulations have shown that @xmath3 in two dimensions @xcite and that @xmath1 ranges from @xmath4 to @xmath5 in three dimensions @xcite . nowadays there is a conjecture relating the smaller and the higher value of the roughness exponent @xmath1 to the speed of crack propagation through the sample @xcite .",
    "the greater value has been associated with a high speed of crack propagation and interpreted as a dynamic regime .",
    "in contrast , the smaller value of the exponent was related with a quasi - static regime , where the dynamic effects of the propagation are negligible .",
    "experimentally , the smaller and the higher value of @xmath1 are connected to the length scale at which the crack is examined .",
    "the smaller value is associated to small length scales and the higher value is connected to large length scales @xcite .",
    "several models used to study the characterization of the fracture surface by the roughness exponent do not consider the influence of the temperature on the fracture process . in this paper",
    "we present a fibrous model in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions for which it is possible to obtain the fracture profile of a fibrous material submitted to a constant force f , for example , by a hanging weight on it . in this work",
    "the influence of the temperature @xmath6 on the fracture process was considered .",
    "we show that , at the boundary between the catastrophic and the slowly shredding regime , the roughness exponent @xmath1 does not depend on the temperature @xmath6 .",
    "our model consists of a bundle of @xmath7 parallel fibers , all with the same elastic constant , @xmath8 , distributed on a triangular lattice . in order to simulate the height of the sample ,",
    "the fibers are divided in @xmath9 segments with the same length .",
    "the fiber bundle is fixed at both extremes by two parallel plates , one of these is fixed and in the other a constant force @xmath0 is applied .",
    "this force is equally and completely distributed in the fiber bundle , submitting all fibers to the same linear deformation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the number of unbroken fibers .",
    "this type of distribution is called equal load sharing ( els ) @xcite .",
    "another type is the local load sharing ( lls ) , where the load of a broke fiber is transfer onto its two nearest unbroken fibers @xcite . at our model ,",
    "when the deformation @xmath12 reaches a critical value @xmath13 , the failure probability of an isolated fiber is equal to one .",
    "the failure probability of a fiber _ i _ is given by @xcite @xmath14 , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the number of unbroken neighboring fibers , @xmath16 is the strain of the material , @xmath17 is the normalized temperature , @xmath18 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath19 is the absolute temperature and @xmath20 is the critical elastic energy . in this model , besides finding the failure probability of a fiber , we have to indicate in which segment it breaks . since",
    ", each fiber of the bundle can break at different parts a fracture surface is produce .",
    "similar procedure was used in ref @xcite to obtain the fracture profile of a model for fracture on fibrous materials in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions . the segment is randomly selected and the probability of the fiber to break in it is given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 is a vector which indicates how many times a segment @xmath23 broke and @xmath24 .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) simulates a concentration of tension near to the region where the fiber bundle is weaker .    at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "the bundle is submitted to an initial strain given by @xmath25 at each time step we randomly choose a fiber of a set of @xmath26 unbroken fibers .",
    "the number @xmath27 represents a percentage of fibers and allow us to work with any system size .",
    "then , using eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , we evaluate the fiber failure probability @xmath28 and compare it with a random number @xmath29 in the interval [ 0,1 ) .",
    "if @xmath30 the fiber breaks . we then choose a segment @xmath23 in the fiber and evaluate its probability @xmath31 to break , using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "if the probability @xmath31 is higher than a random number @xmath32 the fiber breaks in the chosen segment . if not , we analyze the neighboring segments ( j+1 ) and ( j-1 ) and again , evaluate the probability @xmath31 .",
    "if the condition @xmath33 does not hold to neither of the neighboring segments , we return to the initial segment and test the condition @xmath33 for a new value of @xmath32 .",
    "this process continues until the condition @xmath33 is true .",
    "once defined the segment where the fiber breaks , we begin to test all neighboring unbroken fibers .",
    "the first segment tested in the neighboring unbroken fibers is the one in which the previous fiber broke .",
    "the failure probability @xmath28 of these neighboring fibers increases due to the decreasing of @xmath15 and a cascade of breaking fibers may begin .",
    "this procedure describes the propagation of a crack through the fiber bundle in the perpendicular direction to the applied force .",
    "the process of propagation stops when the test of the probability does not allow rupture of any other fiber on the border of the crack or when the crack meets another already formed crack .",
    "the same cascade propagation is attempted by choosing another fiber of the set @xmath34 .",
    "after all the @xmath34 fibers have been tested , the strain @xmath35 is increased if some fibers have been broken . since the force is fixed ,",
    "the greater the number of broken fibers , the larger is the strain on the intact fibers and the higher is their failure probability .",
    "then , another set of @xmath34 unbroken fibers is chosen and all the rupture process is restarted .",
    "the simulation terminates when all the fibers of the bundle are broken , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the bundle is divided into two parts .",
    "we performed simulations considering @xmath36 ( @xmath37 fibers ) , the elastic constant @xmath38 , the critical deformation @xmath39 and the number of segments @xmath40 .",
    "the failure probability ( eq . [ eq1 ] ) can be written as    @xmath41    where the parameter @xmath42 is defined as    @xmath43    for a triangular lattice ( with coordination number 6 ) and @xmath44 , the rupture of any fiber induces the rupture of the whole bundle , i.e. , the bundle breaks with just one crack .",
    "obviously , this crack forms a cluster which percolates through the entire system .",
    "we can define the density of the percolation crack as    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the number of broken fibers belonging to the percolating crack .",
    "thus , when @xmath44 , we have @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ is1 ] shows the density of the percolation crack @xmath48 versus the initial strain @xmath49 , for two different temperatures .",
    "notice that , for high values of @xmath49 , @xmath50 and for low values of @xmath49 the density of the percolating cluster @xmath48 jumps to zero .",
    "thus , we may assume that there is a critical value @xmath51 which depends on the temperature @xmath6 .",
    "for the temperatures @xmath52 and @xmath53 used in our simulation the values obtained for @xmath51 are @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively . above @xmath51",
    "there is a percolation crack and below it any single crack percolates the fiber bundle .",
    "the critical value , @xmath51 , represents the transition between two failure regimes @xcite : catastrophic and slowly shredding . in the catastrophic regime there are cracks that percolate the fiber bundle and in the slowly shredding any crack percolates the bundle . in ref.@xcite we have shown that these two regimes are separated by a second order phase transition and determined from ( eq .",
    "[ po ] ) the critical line separating these two failure regimes in the plane @xmath56 .",
    "figure [ is2 ] shows the fracture surface obtained for @xmath53 and three different initial strains @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ is2 ] ( a ) the fracture surface is very rough and this profile is characteristic of a shredding fracture , in which the speed of crack propagation is low due to a slow process of successive rupture of fibers in the material . in fig .",
    "[ is2 ] ( c ) the fracture surface presents little roughness and is characteristic of catastrophic fracture . here the crack propagates with high speed and the breakage of a single fiber induces the rupture of the whole the bundle . for @xmath57 [ fig .",
    "[ is2 ] ( b ) ] the fracture occurs at the boundary between the two failure regimes .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ is2 ] that the rupture of the sample begins at different segments , since we did not used a deterministic starting notch in our simulations .",
    "in order to evaluate the roughness exponent @xmath1 different one - dimensional cuts in the fracture surface were considered .",
    "the roughness @xmath58 of each cut was found by the method of the best linear least - square fitting described in @xcite . in this method , the roughness @xmath59 in the scale @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 and the local roughness @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 ^ 2.\\ ] ] @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the linear fitting coefficients to the displacement data on the interval @xmath66 $ ] centered on the fiber @xmath67 .",
    "the roughness exponent @xmath1 at the critical point @xmath51 for two temperatures @xmath6 was calculated and a value of @xmath68 was obtained .",
    "our results indicate that at the critical point the value of @xmath1 does not depend on the temperature @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ is3 ] shows the fits for roughness @xmath58 at @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we also verified that , as the initial strain @xmath49 decreases below @xmath51 , the rupture process and , consequently , the speed of crack propagation become more slow .",
    "in this situation the roughness exponent @xmath1 tend to zero . in fig .",
    "[ is5 ] we show the plot of the time to failure ( in monte carlo step ) @xmath69 as function of the initial strain @xmath49 for @xmath53 .",
    "notice that the time decreases with increase of the initial strain @xmath49 . for @xmath70",
    "the rupture is catastrophic and the material breaks in the first time step . in this regime",
    "was not possible to find the roughness exponent @xmath1 .",
    "we believe that in this regime the fracture surface ceases to be self - affine .",
    "the roughness exponent @xmath1 was calculated along the x and  direction . at both directions",
    "we verify that the roughness exponent has the same value .",
    "this behavior is expected for a large variety of materials , where the two directions have similar scaling properties @xcite . at the transition",
    "we have observed a power law behavior on the number of cracks versus its size .",
    "the log - log diagram of the frequency of the cracks @xmath71 versus their sizes @xmath72 observed for @xmath53 and @xmath73 is shown in fig .",
    "note that at the beginning @xmath71 seems to decay linearly so that we can assume a power law @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "we observed that at the transition this exponent does not depend on the temperature .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a model for fracture on fibrous materials in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions which provides the fracture surface of the material , in contrast with previous models .",
    "we calculated the roughness exponent @xmath1 and showed that it does not depend on the temperature @xmath6 .",
    "our results indicate a value of @xmath76 at the boundary between the catastrophic ( similar to the dynamic regime ) and the slowly shredding regime ( similar to the quasi - static regime ) .",
    "this value is the same obtained in other type of simulations in three dimensions @xcite that related the exponent @xmath1 with the quasi - static regime .",
    "we also have shown that at the boundary there is a power law connecting the frequency @xmath71 and the size @xmath72 of the size .",
    "this power law behavior is characteristic of systems in the criticality and is a good indication that the fracture surface is a fractal .",
