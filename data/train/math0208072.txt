    "graph coloring is a classical combinatorial topic : for a given ( finite ) graph @xmath5 , determine how to distribute a minimal number of colors to the vertices in such a way that adjacent vertices get different colors .",
    "the minimum number of colors is @xmath6 , the",
    "_ chromatic number _ of the graph .",
    "the graph coloring problem has numerous important practical motivations ; among the more recent ones , we mention that it appears as a ( simplified ) model for the frequency assignment problem in mobile communication ( cf .",
    "borndrfer et.al .",
    "@xcite and eisenbltter et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the most famous graph coloring problem is , of course , the four color problem , asking whether every planar graph can be colored by four colors , which was answered positively by haken and appell 1977 and re - solved by robertson , sanders , seymour & thomas @xcite . even for planar graphs , though",
    ", determining 3-colorability is already algorithmically difficult ( np - hard ) , and beyond the range of planar graphs , the gaps between the upper and the lower bounds that one can reasonably obtain for @xmath6 may be huge .",
    "this claim is supported both by theoretical results on the complexity of graph coloring algorithms ( see the discussion in khanna , linial & safra @xcite ) and from the perspective of combinatorial optimization ( see mehrotra & trick @xcite ) .",
    "for any given graph @xmath5 , we obtain an _ upper bound _ on the chromatic number @xmath6 by `` guessing '' a coloring , for example , by running a coloring heuristic .",
    "( see @xcite for implementations , and reed & molloy @xcite for a theoretical study of randomized algorithms . )",
    "how can we check that such an upper bound is good , that is , close to the actual chromatic number ?",
    "we need a _ lower bound _ on the chromatic number .",
    "two other basic graph parameters lead to straightforward `` combinatorial '' lower bounds for @xmath6 : the _ clique number _ @xmath7 , the largest number of mutually adjacent vertices in @xmath5 , obviously satisfies @xmath8 , and we also have @xmath9 for every graph @xmath5 on @xmath10 vertices , where @xmath11 is the _ independence number _ of @xmath5 , that is , the maximum number of mutually nonadjacent vertices in @xmath5 . both @xmath7 and @xmath11",
    "are hard to compute , or even approximate , for general graphs . but even leaving this aside , both of these bounds may be very weak , since one can construct graphs where both @xmath7 and @xmath12 are arbitrarily small compared to @xmath6 .    a considerably more sophisticated lower bound for @xmath6 ( still hard to compute in general ) is the _ fractional chromatic number _",
    "@xmath13 , which can be briefly defined as the minimum ratio @xmath14 such that @xmath5 has a @xmath15-fold covering by @xmath16 independent sets .",
    "( the name is motivated by a slightly different but equivalent definition , in which each color can still be used only on an independent set of vertices , but one is allowed to use fractional amounts of colors , say to color a vertex by @xmath17 of red and by @xmath18 of blue . )",
    "the gap between @xmath13 and @xmath6 can still be arbitrarily large , but it is much harder to come up with examples of this .",
    "( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* part  viii ) for further discussion . )    actually , only very few types of such examples are known , and the arguably most important ones are provided by _",
    "kneser graphs_. the kneser graph @xmath19 has all the @xmath20 @xmath1-element subsets of @xmath2 as vertices and all pairs of disjoint sets as edges .",
    "it arose in an innocent little problem that martin kneser posed in 1955 here , in the _ jahresbericht der dmv _ @xcite .",
    "( apparently the problem arose from kneser s study of a number - theoretic paper @xcite by kaplansky . )",
    "kneser asked for a proof that @xmath21 , and conjectured that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is easy to verify using a simple greedy coloring .",
    "kneser s question posed a substantial challenge since all the classical lower bounds listed above fail for kneser graphs .",
    "for suitable parameters , say for @xmath24 , we have :    the chromatic number is large , @xmath25 , and an optimal coloring is easy to find ( by a greedy approach ) .    at the same time , the clique number is small , @xmath26 ( the graph is triangle - free for @xmath27 ) .",
    "the independence number is huge , @xmath28 , and thus the corresponding lower bound for the chromatic number , which also happens to agree with the fractional chromatic number , are small : @xmath29 .",
    "other , more `` algebraic '' types of lower bounds on the chromatic numbers of graphs , in terms of the lovsz theta function ( see lovsz @xcite and knuth @xcite ) or on the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix ( see van lint & wilson ( * ? ? ?",
    "31 ) and godsil & royle ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  9 ) ) do not help to close the gap in the case of kneser graphs .    in 1978",
    "lovsz @xcite settled kneser s conjecture by an original application of a tool from algebraic topology , the borsuk ",
    "ulam theorem .",
    "he thus provided a completely new type of lower bound which in the case of the kneser conjecture was tight .    in subsequent years a number of new proofs of the kneser conjecture and of various extensions of it became available .",
    "all of them are of topological nature , and all of them depend on the borsuk ",
    "ulam theorem or some variant of it .",
    "( this remains essentially true despite recent demonstrations that some proofs can be combinatorialized @xcite , @xcite , since the underlying ideas are still topological . ) the proof methods are diverse , though , and at first sight they look almost unrelated .",
    "the kneser graphs @xmath19 are quite special , but the methods known for proving kneser s conjecture , starting with lovsz s @xcite break - through , extend beyond the original examples : each of them yields , explicitly or implicitly , a lower bound for the chromatic number of any graph ( as we will see , _ every _ graph is a `` generalized kneser graph '' ) , although they are rather weak for some classes of graphs .",
    "these bounds are , of course , all tight in the case of the kneser graphs @xmath19 , but otherwise their strengths are apparently different : for example , only some of them yield tight bounds for the chromatic number of certain subgraphs of the kneser graphs investigated by schrijver @xcite .    in the following , we will compare the various `` topological lower bounds on the chromatic number . ''",
    "in the course of our arguments , we also sketch proofs for them ; some of these proofs are quite elementary and simple , and sometimes considerably simpler than the original derivations .",
    "we show that , surprisingly , the topological lower bounds for the chromatic number resulting from known proofs fall neatly into a hierarchy , which is essentially linearly ordered .",
    "so , we show that `` ( the index version of ) the lovsz bound is stronger than the ( generalized ) sarkaria bound , which is stronger than the ( generalized ) brny bound , and also stronger than the donikov  k  bound . ''",
    "( this , of course , should not indicate any comparison of the usefulness of the methods or of the interest of the papers .",
    "the hierarchy concerns only the bounds that , _ in principle _ , can be obtained by straightforward generalizations of these approaches , and it does not say anything about the feasibility of actually obtaining these bounds . )    * lovsz proof and box complexes . *    a slightly modernized version of lovsz original proof works along the following lines . to every graph @xmath5 ,",
    "one assigns a topological space @xmath30 .",
    "the construction goes via a simplicial complex .",
    "this , on the one hand , is a purely combinatorial object ( a hereditary set system ) , and on the other hand , it is canonically associated with a topological space ( the geometric realization ) .",
    "then , for every coloring of @xmath5 by @xmath31 colors , one constructs a continuous map from the space @xmath30 to the space @xmath32 assigned to the complete graph @xmath33 . to show that @xmath5 has no @xmath31-coloring",
    ", it suffices to exclude the existence of a continuous map @xmath34 .    of course , things can not be as simple as this , since every topological space has a continuous map to any nonempty topological space , namely , a constant map .",
    "one has to consider extra structure on the space @xmath30 , called a _",
    "@xmath4-action_. a @xmath4-action on a topological space @xmath35 is a homeomorphism @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for every @xmath38 .",
    "a primary example of a topological space with a @xmath4-action , or a _ @xmath4-space _ , is the @xmath10-dimensional unit sphere @xmath39 in @xmath40 with the @xmath4-action given by @xmath41 , i.e. , the antipodality .",
    "the cleverly constructed space @xmath30 comes equipped with a @xmath4-action @xmath42 , and for @xmath43 , the space @xmath32 even miraculously happens to be ( equivalent to ) a sphere with the antipodality as the @xmath4-action ! (",
    "the dimension of this sphere depends on @xmath31 , and as we will see , it may differ slightly in various possible constructions of @xmath30 . ) moreover , the continuous map @xmath44 obtained from an @xmath31-coloring of @xmath5 is a _",
    "@xmath4-map _ , meaning that it commutes with the @xmath4-actions : @xmath45 .    here",
    "the borsuk  ulam theorem enters .",
    "the most popular version of it states that for every continuous map @xmath46 , there is a point @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "however , an equivalent version asserts that there is no @xmath4-map @xmath49 for @xmath50 . a suitable generalization of this result",
    "can sometimes be used to show that , for a particular graph @xmath5 , there is no @xmath4-map of @xmath30 into @xmath32 , and consequently , that @xmath5 is not @xmath31-colorable .",
    "this high - level outline of lovsz does not tell one how to construct suitable spaces @xmath30 .",
    "we should also remark that lovsz original proof proceeded in a slightly different way , without explicitly introducing the @xmath4-map . a class of constructions which allows to phrase the proof in the simple and conceptual way sketched above are various _ box complexes _ assigned to a graph , which can successfully play the role of @xmath30 in the above discussion .",
    "a box complex first appears in alon , frankl , and lovsz @xcite ( where it was defined for hypergraphs ) , and another version was used by k  @xcite .",
    "formal definitions of box complexes will be given later , but roughly we can say that a box complex of a graph @xmath5 is made of all complete bipartite subgraphs of @xmath5 .",
    "a complete bipartite subgraph of @xmath5 is specified by two disjoint subsets @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the vertex set , such that every vertex @xmath53 is connected by an edge to every vertex @xmath54 .",
    "the exchange of the subsets @xmath51 and @xmath52 yields an involution on the box complex , and makes it into a @xmath4-space .    on an intuitive level",
    ", the construction of the continuous @xmath4-map from the box complex of @xmath5 into the box complex of @xmath33 can be described as follows ( we are indebted by lovsz for a beautiful summary of the proof , which inspired much of the present discussion ) : if @xmath55 is a proper @xmath31-coloring of @xmath5 , then whenever two disjoint sets @xmath56 determine a complete bipartite subgraph in @xmath5 , they are assigned two disjoint color sets @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which thus determine a complete bipartite subgraph of @xmath33 . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath59 and @xmath60 give a larger complete bipartite subgraph , they receive larger color sets @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "this allows one to define the continuous map of the box complexes . finally , if we interchange @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the color sets are interchanged as well , and this makes the map of the box complexes a @xmath4-map .",
    "summarizing , an @xmath31-coloring of @xmath5 yields a @xmath4-map of the box complex of @xmath5 into the box complex of @xmath33 .",
    "if we use the convenient notion of the _ index _ of a @xmath4-space , which is the smallest @xmath31 such that the @xmath4-space can be @xmath4-mapped into the sphere @xmath63 with the antipodal @xmath4-action , we get that the index of the box complex of any @xmath31-colorable graph has to be at least as large as the index of the box complex of @xmath33 .",
    "the latter can be computed once and for all ( as we remarked above , the box complex of @xmath33 happens to be equivalent to a sphere with the antipodal action ) .",
    "thus , the application of this method boils down to bounding below the index of the box complex of @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , these ideas have several different implementations : there are several distinct possibilities to define `` box complexes . ''",
    "the different box complexes have different ground sets , they are of different sizes ( the numbers of vertices / faces differ on an exponential scale ! ) , and some of them may be considerably easier to use than others .",
    "our current favorite is the box complex @xmath64 , defined in section  [ s : overw ] below .",
    "it has a small vertex set ( the disjoint union of two copies of @xmath65 ) , and it yields the strongest bounds available .",
    "however , we invite the reader to survey the panorama and to make his / her own choices  several more versions of box complexes are discussed in section  [ sec : box_complexes ]",
    ". we will show that many of them are equivalent for the purposes of estimating the chromatic number .",
    "here we recall some general notions , facts , and notation needed for a precise statement of the results .",
    "we repeat some of the definitions mentioned in the introduction more formally .    unfortunately , for space reasons , we can not afford to introduce all the required topological notions at a leisurely pace , and so the rest of the paper may not be easily accessible without some knowledge of topological combinatorics .",
    "we refer to @xcite or @xcite for surveys of the terminology and tools employed in this paper and to @xcite for a detailed textbook treatment . on the other hand",
