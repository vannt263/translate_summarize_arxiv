    "graphene is attracting considerable attention due to its unusual electronic properties including : large mean free path ,  relativistic \" dispersion of the low - lying electron states , and  valley \" degeneracy @xcite .",
    "these remarkable features made many researchers hope that some day graphene mesoscopic structures might revolutionise nanoscience .",
    "thus , a substantial amount of effort has been invested investigating graphene devices , such as quantum dots @xcite , bilayer structures @xcite , and nanoribbons @xcite .    studying the physics of nanoribbons , a certain discrepancy between results of first - principle calculations @xcite , experiments @xcite , and single - electron approximations @xcite",
    "was stumbled upon : whereas the single - electron approximation predicts that , depending on its width , an armchair nanoribbon could be either semiconducting or metallic , both experiments and first - principle calculations suggest that it is always semiconducting : a nanoribbon of any width @xmath0 has gap at the fermi level ; the magnitude of the gap scales as @xmath1 .",
    "two different mechanisms were proposed to explain this disagreement . according to the first mechanism",
    "the gap is due to electron - electron interactions @xcite . at zero doping the interaction induces a charge gap .",
    "the physics here is similar to the mott transition in the hubbard model at half filling .",
    "if the coulomb coupling constant @xmath2 is large ( @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the carbon - carbon hopping amplitude ) , the gap scales as @xmath2 . if @xmath2 is small , the gap vanishes faster than @xmath2 . since @xmath5 ,",
    "such mechanism is consistent with the observed scaling @xmath6 for small @xmath0 only . for large",
    "@xmath0 the gap decays faster than @xmath1 .",
    "another way to explain the gap was outlined in @xcite , where first - principle computations have shown that the length of the carbon - carbon bonds at the hydrogen - passivated edge is shorter than the length of the bonds in the bulk . due to this",
    ", the hopping amplitude across the bonds dangling from the nanoribbon edge ( @xmath7 ) differs from @xmath4 : @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( see fig.[edge - h ] where the short bonds are shown in bold ) . because of @xmath10 , the nanoribbon s hamiltonian acquires an additional term .",
    "it couples states with the same momentum above and below the fermi energy ; such coupling opens a gap in the electronic spectrum . assuming that @xmath10 depends mainly on the chemical properties of the edge ( e.g. , nature of the passivating radical or absence thereof ) , one can demonstrate that the effective strength of this coupling is inversely proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the relation @xmath6 is recovered .",
    "in addition to these mechanisms , other instabilities can be present as well .",
    "which mechanism of gap generation dominates depends on a variety of factors , such as electrostatic screening by the gate electrode , mechanical forces applied to the nanoribbon , edge passivation , etc .      in this paper",
    "we will study in detail the second mechanism described above .",
    "we will show that the armchair nanoribbon is unstable toward the deformations of the edge bonds .",
    "specifically , we prove the following : if the radical passivating the edge is carefully picked ( to ensure that it does not modify the hopping at the edges : @xmath11 ) , then the total energy of the nanoribbon would become a decreasing function of the edge bond deformation . in other words ,",
    "spontaneous deformations of the dangling bonds are favourable for they decrease the total nanoribbon energy .",
    "such deformations make @xmath7 unequal to @xmath4 .    to understand the physics behind this , it is convenient to describe such deformation using a real one - component ( ising - like ) order parameter @xmath10 . at the mean - field level we can state that the energy of the deformed bonds is increased by the amount @xmath12 , while the energy of the conducting electrons decreases by the amount @xmath13 . since @xmath14 , the total energy , @xmath15 , always has a minimum at not - zero @xmath16 .",
    "it is useful to extend the analogy between our system and the ising model further .",
    "notice that our chemical forces deforming the edge bonds are similar to the  magnetic field \" coupled to the order parameter ( the  magnetisation \" ) in the ising model .",
    "thus , it is natural to refer to these chemical forces as the  edge field \" .",
    "in practice , we have very limited control over the magnitude of the  edge field \" : it is very difficult to select the radical attached to the nanoribbon s edge to guarantee that @xmath17 .",
    "using the analogy between our nanoribbon and the ising model , we conclude that , since the  field \" is always switched on , our system is always away from the critical regime .    yet even a system with a strong  edge field \" may be tuned to criticality by disordering the  field \" .",
    "this way , the disorder may be used as a tool to control spectral properties of nanoribbons .    disorder can be introduced by passivating the edges by radicals of two different types , randomly distributed along the length of the nanoribbon . the hopping amplitude at the edge",
    "@xmath7 would become a function of the coordinate along the ribbon : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is independent of @xmath20 , while @xmath21 is the disordered part .    in such system",
    "the electronic spectrum is very sensitive to the relative strengths of @xmath19 and @xmath22 : when the disorder is weak , the spectrum has ( pseudo)gap due to non - zero @xmath19 term ; when @xmath23 , the pseudogap closes , and the nanoribbon is in the disorder - dominated regime .",
    "the crossover between these two regimes can be observed with the help of transport measurements . in a nanoribbon",
    "whose length @xmath24 is thermodynamically large , the conductance vanishes exponentially in both regimes : when there is no disorder , the finite gap removes density of states from the fermi level ; when there is disorder , the wave functions are localized .",
    "thus , for very long nanoribbons the conductance is suppressed regardless of the disorder strength .",
    "the situation is different for a mesoscopic sample .",
    "note that the localization is a weaker phenomenon than the gap opening in the sense that the inverse of the localization length @xmath25 is the second order in the disorder strength : @xmath26 , while the inverse of the length scale @xmath27 charachterizing the gap size is linear in @xmath10 : @xmath28 .",
    "that is , a longer nanoribbon is required to observe a well - developed localization .",
    "therefore , it is possible to choose @xmath24 sufficiently short to have no localization features at any disorder , and yet long enough to observe the spectral gap when the disorder is low .",
    "thus , when the disorder is absent , the low - temperature conductance of the sample is exponentially suppressed due to the gap ; otherwise , the conductance is finite down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "therefore , the disorder effectively closes the gap .",

    "[ bz ] ) : @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these are the locations of the famous dirac cones of graphene .",
    "these six cones can be split into two equivalence classes : the locations of any two cones inside the same equivalence class differ by a reciprocal lattice vector . thus , we do not need all six of them .",
    "two inequivalent cones are sufficient : @xmath53      consider now the electron states of the armchair nanoribbon ( see fig .",
    "[ ribbon ] ) .",
    "such nanoribbon is defined by the condition @xmath54 .",
    "the width of the nanoribbon @xmath0 is a multiple of @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is an integer .",
    "the schrdinger equation for the edge sites differs from eqs .",
    "( [ sch_a ] ) and ( [ sch_b ] ) . for sites on the upper edge ( @xmath58 ) we can write : @xmath59 note the absence of the summation over the lattice vectors in the right - hand side of these equations",
    ". this boundary condition is called free",
    ". it can be easily generalized for the lower edge .",
    "an armchair nanoribbon is invariant under a shift over @xmath60 along the @xmath20-axis .",
    "thus , a @xmath60 long nanoribbon segment can be thought of as a nanoribbon unit cell .",
    "there are @xmath61 graphene unit cells in a nanoribbon unit cell .",
    "the nanoribbon brillouin zone is : @xmath62    now we assume that all carbon - carbon bonds of our system have the same hopping amplitude @xmath4 ( that is , the deformation of the edge bonds is absent ) . the wave function @xmath63 satisfies the free boundary conditions eqs .",
    "( [ sch_a_edge ] ) and ( [ sch_b_edge ] ) at @xmath64 and similar conditions at @xmath65 .",
    "it is not convenient , however , to work with such boundary conditions directly .",
    "fortunately , if we add an additional row of lattice sites at each edge and demand that the wave function vanishes at these auxiliary sites ( see fig .   [ ribbon ] ) , then the wave function at the real edge sites satisfies the free boundary condition . in other words , our _ free _ boundary condition problem for a nanoribbon of width @xmath0 is equivalent to the _ zero _ boundary condition problem for a nanoribbon of width @xmath66 .",

    "if @xmath181 , @xmath183 has its largest possible value : @xmath184 therefore , if the sample length satisfies : @xmath185 the perturbation theory in the disorder strength is justified for any concentration @xmath175 .",
    "it is possible to prove that @xmath186 . indeed",
    ", this inequality is equivalent to : @xmath187 both factors on the left - hand side of this expression are much larger than unity . therefore , unless @xmath158 is very big , @xmath186 . loosely speaking",
    ", this inequality suggests that the disordered field is a much weaker perturbation than the ordered one .",
    "consider now a nanoribbon whose length @xmath24 satisfies : @xmath188 this means that even the strongest disorder ( @xmath189 ) can not create a well - developed localization in our nanoribbon ; on the other hand , when the sample is close to perfect order ( @xmath190 ) the spectral gap fully manifests itself .",
    "let us now study the electrical conductance of such nanoribbon .",
    "assume first that our system has no edge disorder : @xmath191 .",
    "then @xmath192 , and eq .",
    "( [ pert_order ] ) is violated .",
    "therefore , the  edge field \" opens a gap in the spectrum .",
    "the dimensionless conductance @xmath2 of a sample with the gap is exponentially small at @xmath49 : @xmath193 when we slightly disorder our system by introducing a small concentration @xmath175 of radicals ` @xmath148 ' , the conductance increases since @xmath151 decreases [ see eq.([dt ] ) ] .",
    "thus , _ the disorder improves electrical conductance ! _    in the opposite limit of complete disorder , we have @xmath180 , and the localization length becomes @xmath189 .",
    "perturbation theory may now be applied since eq .",
    "( [ pert_disorder ] ) holds true . instead of a disorder - induced localization , which is a non - perturbative phenomenon , in a sufficiently short nanoribbon the disorder creates weak corrections to the properties of @xmath194 .",
    "in such sample the conductance remains finite even at @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we reach the following counter - intuitive conclusion : _ a completely ordered nanoribbon shows  insulating \" behaviour , while a disordered one shows  metallic \" . _ [ we put quotes around  insulating \" and  metallic \" for metal and insulator are quantum phases , which can be unambiguously defined only in the thermodynamic limit @xmath195 ; however , the latter limit is incompatible with eq .",
    "( [ meso ] ) . ]",
    "as the system moves from perfect order to total disorder , it passes through a crossover from  insulating \" to  metallic \" conductance . indeed , eq .",
    "( [ g_order ] ) is applicable only when @xmath196 is much bigger than unity .",
    "if @xmath197 one can validate the perturbation theory not only in orders of @xmath22 , but also in orders of @xmath151 [ see eq.([pert_order ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , once @xmath24 exceeds @xmath171 , the exponential dependence of @xmath2 is replaced by a slower function , and @xmath2 remains of order unity down to the completely disordered regime .",
    "finally , let us comment on the conductance behaviour in a thermodynamically large sample , whose length satisfies : @xmath198 in this situation both terms of @xmath122 can not always be treated with the help of perturbation theory .",
    "consequently , the conductance is always exponentially suppressed : when there is perfect order , the conductance follows eq.([g_order ] ) ; in the opposite case ( complete disorder ) we have : @xmath199 the latter equation is a manifestation of wave function localization , which can only be observed in a sample whose length exceeds @xmath179 .    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ g_dis ] ) and ( [ g_order ] ) with the help of eq .",
    "( [ hier ] ) , we note that , as well as in the case of a short nanoribbon , the conductance of a perfectly ordered sample is much smaller than the conductance of a totally disordered sample .",
    "the conductance @xmath2 of a long nanoribbon is a non - monotonous function of disorder ( see fig .",
    "[ conduct ] ) .",
    "such a behaviour is a consequence of the crossover from the gap - dominated to the disorder - dominated regime .",
    "when the concentration @xmath175 is small , the gap is the dominant parameter controlling the conductance . under such circumstances eq.([g_order ] ) is obeyed .",
    "the disorder acts mainly to reduce the gap .",
    "thus , if disorder is weak , then @xmath2 is an increasing function of @xmath175 .    as @xmath175 keeps growing , @xmath171 increases , while @xmath179 decreases .",
    "the crossover occurs at : @xmath200 and the sample enters the disorder - dominated regime .",
    "the conductance is given by eq .",
    "( [ g_dis ] ) .",
    "it is a decreasing function of @xmath175 when the latter is close to 1/2 .",
    "in this paper we studied the effects of edge bond deformations on the electronic properties of nanoribbons .",
    "we have seen that a nanoribbon of a certain width is unstable with respect to a spontaneous deformation of the edge bonds .",
    "while such deformation increases the energy of the affected bonds , it also reduces the electronic energy . as a result of a ` bond instability ' the electronic spectrum acquires a gap at the fermi level .",
    "we also pointed out that this instability is difficult to observe in a real system .",
    "the culprit is the chemical structure of the edges , which deforms the bonds to optimize the chemical energy at the edges .",
    "although it might be hard to remove this chemical modification of the edge bonds , it is quite possible to reduce its effect on the electronic spectrum by disordering the radicals passivating the edge bonds .",
    "we demonstrated that the disorder can vary the electrical conductance of a nanoribbon . in case of a short nanoribbon ,",
    "the conductance would change from  insulating \" regime at low disorder to a  metallic \" regime at high disorder .",
    "when the nanoribbon s length is large , the conductance is a non - monotonous function of the disorder .",
    "thus , the disorder may be a useful tool which allows one to control the electric transport through nanoribbons .",
