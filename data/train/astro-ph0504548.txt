    "( 1993 ) was a typical dust - forming nova which showed evidence for carbon , silicate and hydrocarbon dust ( evans et al .",
    "1997 , mason et al .",
    "early iue observations ( shore et al .",
    "1994 ) suggested that the grains grew to @xmath2  shortly after dust condensation .",
    "mason et al .",
    "( 1998 ) modelled broadband infrared ( ir ) data using a combination of dust types , and concluded that the circumstellar dust shell consisted of carbon and silicate grains in the ratio @xmath3:1 by mass .",
    "evans et al .",
    "( 1997 ; hereafter paper  ii ) presented ir spectroscopy of the dust in , with some data covering the wavelength range 224 .",
    "in addition to nebular and coronal features , emission features normally associated with hydrocarbons ",
    "the so - called ` unidentified infrared ' ( uir ) bands  were present in the spectra .",
    "the uir features in   were at wavelengths 3.28 , 3.4 , 8.1 , 8.7 and 11.4 ; the ` 8.1 ' and ` 11.4 ' feature seem to correspond respectively to the uir features normally seen at 7.7  and 11.25  ( but see  [ uirf ] below ) , while the ` 3.4 ' feature was much stronger relative to the ` 3.28 ' than is generally the case in other astrophysical environments .",
    "the properties of the uir bands in  and in other novae indicate a set of uir features peculiar to novae ( geballe 1997 ) , due either to the nova - specific environment or excitation conditions .",
    "the 10  spectrum of  also displayed a prominent silicate feature at @xmath4  and possibly a broad , weak feature at 18  ( paper  ii ) .",
    "the 10  feature in  was narrow , and peaked at 9.7 , in contrast to the broader silicate features in novae aql 1982 and her 1991 , which were also shifted to longer wavelength ( see smith et al .",
    "this implies that the silicate in novae aql and her displayed a degree of crystallinity , whereas that in  was amorphous .",
    "( 6.0,5.5 ) ( 0.0,4.0 )    ( 0.0,4.0 )    in paper  ii we fitted a simple function of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the planck function at temperature @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is a constant ( the so - called @xmath8-index for the dust ) , to ir spectra in the range 224 , and concluded that the grains eventually grew to @xmath10 .",
    "however , given the high quality of the data and the availability of the dusty code  which solves the radiative transfer in a dusty environment for a variety of conditions ( ivezi & elitzur 1997 , ivezi , nenkova & elitzur 1999 )  we are now in a position to make a more sophisticated attempt at fitting the data and to re - evaluate the nature of the dust .    here",
    "we describe the application of dusty to model the dust around .",
    "the data analysed here are described in detail in paper  ii ; for consistency with earlier work we take reddening @xmath11 ( hauschildt et al . 1994 ) and 1993 december 14 as the origin of time .",
    "we revisit the distance below .",
    "the fitting procedure works best if there are data on either side of the peak of the dust emission . for",
    ", two datasets satisfy this criterion , namely those for 1994 august ( to which we shall refer as epoch  1 ) , and 1994 october / november ( epoch  2 ) ; at these two epochs we have quasi - simultaneous data over the wavelength range 24  ( @xmath12 ) , 7.513  ( @xmath13 ) , 1624(@xmath14 ) , at resolution @xmath15 ( @xmath12 bands ) and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 bands ) .",
    "the epoch  1 data were obtained within 4  days of each other ( on days 251 and 255 of the outburst , from paper  ii ; we take @xmath18  days ) , while the epoch  2 data were obtained within 40  days of each other ( days 300 and 341 ; we take @xmath19  days ) .",
    "the data are shown in fig .",
    "[ sed ] .    in each case",
    "we assume that the nova and its environment did not change substantially between the times the data were obtained .",
    "obviously this assumption is less secure for the october / november data but our attempts in paper  ii to fit the data with the simple function as discussed above suggest that this assumption is not unreasonable .",
    "( 6.0,5.5 ) ( 0.0,4.0 )    ( 0.0,4.0 )",
    "we use observations of  to estimate the likely properties of the nova and its environment at the time of our observations . for the purposes of the dusty fitting",
    "we shall simply assume that the stellar remnant radiates like a blackbody . while more sophisticated models of the nova photosphere are now routinely available ( see hauschildt et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) , we have no _ a priori _ information about the state of ionization of the ejecta ; however we expect that they are transparent to photons in the lyman continuum at the times of interest .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath20 of a nova radiating at constant bolometric luminosity rises as the pseudophotosphere collapses back onto the white dwarf ( bath & shaviv 1976 ) .",
    "consequently the emission shifts to shorter wavelengths and the visual flux ( in mag ) declines according to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the decline in mag from maximum light and @xmath23  k ( bath & shaviv 1976 ) .",
    "however , observational evidence is that novae at maximum are on the whole rather cooler than 15,280  k , a value closer to @xmath24  k being more typical ( beck et al . , 1995 ; warner 1995 ) ; indeed the lower value is very close to the effective temperature determined for  around maximum by hauschildt et al .",
    "we take @xmath25  k here and use equation  ( [ deltam ] ) to estimate @xmath20 .",
    "we have taken the light curve in paper  ii ( reproduced in fig .",
    "[ tau1]a ) and determined  by a least squares fit over the period @xmath26  days to @xmath27  days , omitting ` glitches ' such as the small pre - dust ` dip ' noted in paper  ii .",
    "we find @xmath28 where @xmath29 is in days ; we therefore have that @xmath30  mag  day@xmath31 ( @xmath32  days , @xmath33  days , @xmath34 being the time for the visual light curve to decline by @xmath35  mag ) , which differs somewhat from that assumed in paper  ii ( @xmath36  mag  day@xmath31 , @xmath37  days ) and is more in line with that given by mason et al .",
    "we take @xmath38  days here .    using the usual relationship between absolute magnitude and rate of decline ( della valle & livio 1995 ) ,",
    "the absolute visual magnitude of  is @xmath39 at maximum light ; using a bolometric correction corresponding to an 8,000  k supergiant the corresponding bolometric luminosity is @xmath40 .",
    "the value of @xmath41 , together with the value of @xmath42 from equation  ( [ lightcurve ] ) and the assumed reddening , gives a distance of @xmath43  kpc ( cf .",
    "3  kpc assumed in paper  ii ) , in which the uncertainty in the reddening is the major contributor to the error .",
    "we estimate the effective temperature of the stellar remnant using equation  ( [ deltam ] ) . for epoch  1 , we find @xmath44  k , while for epoch  2 , @xmath45  k ; there is a @xmath4% uncertainty in @xmath20 that follows from the uncertainty in the coefficient of @xmath29 in equation  ( [ lightcurve ] ) .",
    "although there are in principle several ways of corroborating these values , complementary data at other wavelengths are generally lacking .",
    "in paper  ii we noted the presence of [ si ] ( @xmath46p@xmath47p@xmath48 ) at @xmath49 , which was fairly strong at epoch  1 and also present at epoch  2 ( [ si ] at @xmath50  was also present , but very weak , at epoch  2 ) .",
    "the ionization potential of si@xmath51 is @xmath52  ev .",
    "if we assume that the gas is photoionized rather than collisionally ionized ( see benjamin & dinerstein ( 1990 ) and evans et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for a discussion of this ) , the presence of the [ si ] feature implies a sufficient number of photons with energy @xmath53  ev . for strong [ si ] emission",
    "we suppose for the purpose of estimate that half the emitted photons should be capable of ionizing si@xmath51 , implying an effective temperature @xmath54  k. at @xmath55  k , only @xmath56% of the emitted photons are capable of ionizing si@xmath51 .",
    "the presence of the [ si ] coronal line therefore seems to imply a @xmath20 that is very much greater than 285,000  k ; alternatively , a different ionization mechanism may be operating .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we have subtracted the model fit from the data in the @xmath57 and @xmath13 bands to reveal the profiles of the uir emission ( see fig .",
    "[ uir]a , b ) .",
    "clearly the resultant uir profiles in the @xmath13 band depend to some extent on the profile of the warm silicate feature ( ossenkopf et al .",
    "1992 ) but , as we are looking for possible changes in the uir features this does not qualitatively affect the discussion that follows .    in fig .",
    "[ uir]a the @xmath57-band data from epoch  2 data have been normalized to the epoch  1 data at 3.4  and it is evident that , while the relative strengths of the 3.28  feature and the 3.5  ` plateau ' are essentially unchanged between the two epochs , the 3.4/3.28 ratio may have changed .",
    "there is a weak feature at @xmath58  ( see fig  [ uir]a ) . while this is close to the uir feature at 3.52  ( see geballe 1997 ) , the width of the feature in ( @xmath59  at epoch  2 and corresponding to an expansion velocity @xmath60 ) suggests that it might be a nebular feature rather than a dust feature , which would typically be much broader than this ( see table  [ uirs ] below ) .",
    "further ir spectroscopy of dusty novae in this spectral region is desirable to resolve this issue .",
    "a possible ( nebular ) identification for this feature is h 23 - 6 @xmath61 , although there is no evidence for h 24 - 6 @xmath62 , which is expected to be of comparable strength .",
    "an alternative identification , particularly in view of the common occurrence of [ fe ] lines in the ir spectra of novae ( rudy et al .",
    "2003 ; evans et al .",
    "2003 ) , is [ fe ] @xmath63d@xmath64f@xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "however there are many permitted and forbidden fe transitions in the wavelength range for which we have data and we defer a discussion of the emission line spectrum of  to a later paper .    in fig .",
    "[ uir]b the @xmath13-band data from epoch  2 data have been normalized to the epoch  1 data at 9 ; the primary feature at @xmath67  has a ` shoulder ' at @xmath68  and @xmath69 .",
    "we have fitted the ` 8.1 ' feature with 3 gaussians ( see fig .  [",
    "uir10]a , b and table  [ uirs ] ) .",
    "we note from table  [ uirs ] that the widths of the features are typically @xmath70 , and so these are unlikely to be nebular in origin .",
    "also listed in table  [ uirs ] are the ` standard ' wavelengths and likely identification of ` class  a ' uir features ( i.e. those usually seen in planetary nebulae and h regions ) from geballe ( 1997 ) .",
    "there is no evidence that the central wavelengths of the two ` shoulder ' features ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) change between epochs  1 and 2 ; however there seems to be a distinct change in the peak wavelength of the primary feature between epochs  1 and  2 ( see fig .",
    "[ uir]a and table  [ uirs ] ) , from 8.17  to 8.06 .",
    "this is not an artefact of the subtraction of the model from the data , and likely points to a change in the character of the carrier .",
    "as noted in paper  ii , the 11.3  feature in  appears at a longer wavelength than is usual ( the slight difference between the values in table  [ uirs ] and in paper  ii is a result of the slight difference in the subtracted continuum ) .",
    "we note that there seems to be a significant increase in the strength of the 11.3  feature relative to that of the ` 8.1 ' feature .",
    "it is of interest to consider why nova uir features are in a class of their own ( geballe 1997 ) , and in particular are significantly different from those seen in other astrophysical environments .",
    "laboratory measurements have shown that the peak wavelengths of the ` 3.28 ' , ` 6.2 ' , ` 7.7 ' , ` 8.1 ' and ` 11.3 ' uir features in quenched carbonaceous composite depend on the @xmath73c/@xmath74c ratio , the peak wavelengths increasing linearly with the @xmath73c/@xmath74c ratio ( wada et al .",
    "however there are two reasons why this mechanism can not be operating in .",
    "first , the @xmath73c/@xmath74c ratio in  was low , @xmath75 ( paper  i ) , so isotopic effects will have negligible effect on the wavelengths of the uir features ; however this effect must clearly be looked for in novae with high @xmath73c/@xmath74c ratio .",
    "second , the peak wavelengths of the nova 3.28 and 3.4 features are not anomalous , only their relative strengths are unusual .",
    "if isotopic effects were important the peak wavelengths of all the uir features would be affected , which was not the case in .",
    "( 6.0,5.5 ) ( 0.0,4.0 )    ( 0.0,4.0 )    more plausibly , the nature of the uir carrier in novae is governed by the unique environment in which the pre - dust and dust chemistry takes place .",
    "we consider separately the uir features in the 3and 7 - 13  windows .",
    "[ [ the-3window . ] ] the 3  window .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + +    as is well known , the relative strengths of the ` 3.28 ' and ` 3.4 ' features in novae differ substantially from those in other sources such as planetary nebulae and post - agb stars ( see e.g. geballe 1997 , van diedenhoven et al .",
    "a possible explanation for this is the incorporation of ch@xmath76 and ch@xmath77 groups in the silicate lattice , which experimental studies ( grishko & duley 2002a ) have shown enhances the 3.4  uir feature .    as noted in ",
    "[ comp ] , one explanation for the chemical dichotomy in nova dust shells is that co does not proceed to saturation , allowing the simultaneous condensation of carbonaceous and silicate dusts : the chemistry of grain formation and growth is likely to include the formation of carbonaceous grains with silicate inclusions , and vice versa .",
    "the incorporation of ch@xmath76/ch@xmath77 groups into the silicate lattice in this way is consistent with the simultaneous presence of c - bearing and si / o - bearing dust , and underlines the irrelevance of the c : o ratio to the nature of the condensate in nova winds .",
    "furthermore , ( see  [ size ] ) , the grain size distribution indicates that larger grains may have swept up the smaller . unless there were ( for example ) substantial species - dependent grain charge effects",
    "it is unlikely that larger grains would discriminate between one grain type and another in the sweeping - up process ; this would also give rise to the kind of composite grain hinted at by the 3  uir features .",
    "[ [ the-7 - 13window . ] ] the 7 - 13  window .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    additional support for the hypothesis that ch@xmath76/ch@xmath77 inclusions in silicates could be significant in novae comes from the ` 8.1 ' feature in .",
    "a feature at this wavelength is also seen in laboratory spectra , and may be identified with sich@xmath77 vibration ( w. w. duley , private communication ) .",
    "indeed duley ( private communication ) has suggested that the shift in the peak wavelength of the ` 8.1 ' feature in  between epochs  1 and 2 ( see fig .",
    "[ uir ] and table  [ uirs ] ) may be the result of a change in the co - ordination of sich@xmath77 groups .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that the uir carrier in  ( and indeed in other novae ) is heavily contaminated by other species , notably o or n , particularly the latter given its extreme overabundance ( @xmath78 ; see summary in gehrz et al . , 1998 )",
    "relative to solar in nova winds .",
    "grishko & duley ( 2002b ) have investigated experimentally the ir spectra of hac prepared in the presence of various contaminants , and find that hac deposited in the presence of n - bearing molecules ( particularly nh@xmath77 ) displays several features not present in ` normal ' uir carriers .",
    "in particular , there is a feature at 8.56  ( which grishko & duley attribute to nh@xmath76 rock ) , and a broad ( unidentified ) feature centred at @xmath79  with width @xmath80 , which are close to the features on the ` shoulder ' of the 8.1  feature in ( see fig .  [",
    "uir10]a , b and table  [ uirs ] ) .",
    "we tentatively suggest that the carrier of the uir features in  had a significant nitrogen component .",
    "we have used the dusty code to reassess the properties of the optically thick dust shell around the classical nova v705  cas .",
    "we find    1 .",
    "the dust shell is a @xmath81 ( by number ) mix of amorphous carbon and ` warm silicate ' ; 2 .",
    "the grain size distribution @xmath82 was flat , with @xmath83 ; this may indicate that the larger grains swept up the smaller grains ; 3 .",
    "the maximum grain size in the distribution was @xmath84 , considerably less than that deduced from previous studies ( shore et al .",
    "1994 , paper  ii , gehrz et al .",
    "1998 ) ; 4 .",
    "the dust - bearing shell was , like the co - bearing shell , geometrically thin , such that @xmath85 ; 5 .",
    "the condensation temperature of the dust was @xmath86  k , although in  the situation is complicated by the presence of two condensates ; 6 .",
    "structure in the 8 - 9  uir complex may be due to nitrogenation of the uir carrier ; 7 .",
    "the strength of the 3.4  feature relative to the 3.28feature , commonly seen in novae , as well as the 8.1  feature , may be due to the incorporation of ch@xmath76 and ch@xmath77 groups in the silicate matrix ; 8 .",
    "the silicate dust at least was freshly condensed , judging by the weakness of the 18  silicate feature ; 9 .",
    "the extrapolated angular diameter of the dust shell is such that the resolved remnant seen by diaz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) was very likely due to line emission rather than dust .",
