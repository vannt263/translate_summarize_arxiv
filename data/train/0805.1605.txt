    "the _ covariogram _ @xmath9 of @xmath1 is the function @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denotes @xmath13-dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "this functional , which was introduced by matheron in his book @xcite on random sets , is also sometimes called the _ set covariance _ and it coincides with the _ autocorrelation _ of the characteristic function of @xmath1 : @xmath14 the covariogram @xmath9 is clearly unchanged by a translation or a reflection of @xmath1 .",
    "( the term _ reflection _ will always mean reflection in a point . ) matheron  @xcite in 1986 asked the following question and conjectured a positive answer for the case @xmath15 .    * covariogram problem . * _ does the covariogram determine a convex body , among all convex bodies , up to translations and reflections ? _    the conjecture regarding @xmath15 has been completely settled only very recently , by averkov and bianchi  @xcite .",
    "matheron  @xcite observed that , for @xmath16 and for all @xmath17 , the derivatives @xmath18 give the distribution of the lengths of the chords of @xmath1 parallel to @xmath19 .",
    "such information is common in stereology , statistical shape recognition and image analysis , when properties of an unknown body are to be inferred from chord length measurements ; see  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite , for example .",
    "blaschke asked whether the distribution of the lengths of chords ( in all directions ) of a convex body characterizes the body , but mallows and clark  @xcite proved that this is false even for convex polygons .",
    "in fact ( see  @xcite ) the covariogram problem is equivalent to the problem of determining a convex body from all its separate chord length distributions , one for each direction @xmath16 .",
    "the covariogram problem appears in other contexts .",
    "adler and pyke  @xcite asked in 1991 whether the distribution of the difference @xmath20 of independent random variables @xmath21 and @xmath22 uniformly distributed over @xmath1 determines @xmath1 , up to translations and reflections . since the convolution in is , up to a multiplicative factor , the probability density of @xmath20 , this problem is equivalent to the covariogram problem .",
    "the same authors  @xcite find the covariogram problem relevant also in the study of scanning brownian processes and of the equivalence of measures induced by these processes for different base sets .",
    "the covariogram problem is a special case of the _ phase retrieval problem _ in fourier analysis .",
    "this problem involves determining a function @xmath23 from the modulus of its fourier transform @xmath24 .",
    "since phase and amplitude are in general independent of each other , in order to solve the phase retrieval problem one must use additional information constraining the admissible solutions @xmath23 ; see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "taking fourier transforms in and using the relation @xmath25 , we obtain @xmath26 thus the phase retrieval problem , restricted to the class of characteristic functions of convex bodies , reduces to the covariogram problem .    in x - ray crystallography",
    "the atomic structure of a crystal is to be found from diffraction images . as rosenblatt  @xcite explains , `` here",
    "the phase retrieval problem arises because the modulus of a fourier transform is all that can usually be measured after diffraction occurs . ''",
    "a convenient way of describing many important examples of quasicrystals is via the `` cut and project scheme '' ; see  @xcite . here to the atomic structure , represented by a discrete set @xmath27 contained in a space @xmath28 , is associated a lattice @xmath29 in a higher dimensional space @xmath30 and a `` window '' @xmath31 ( which in many cases is a convex set )",
    ". then @xmath27 coincides with the projection on @xmath28 of the points of the lattice @xmath29 which belong to @xmath32 . in many examples",
    "the lattice @xmath29 can be determined by the diffraction image . to determine @xmath27 it is however necessary to know @xmath33 : the covariogram problem enters at this point , since the covariogram of @xmath33 can be obtained by the diffraction image ; see  @xcite .    in convex geometry",
    "the covariogram appears in several contexts .",
    "for instance it has a central role in the proof of the rogers - shephard inequality  ( * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover the level sets of @xmath9 , which are convex and are called _ convolution bodies _ , have been studied  @xcite and are related to the projection body of @xmath1 .",
    "a discrete version of the covariogram problem has been considered  @xcite . in",
    "@xcite the covariogram problem was transformed to a question for the _ radial mean bodies_.    the first contribution to matheron s question was made by nagel  @xcite in 1993 , who confirmed matheron s conjecture for all convex polygons .",
    "other partial results towards the complete confirmation of this conjecture in the plane have been proved by schmitt  @xcite , bianchi , segala and voli  @xcite , bianchi  @xcite and averkov and bianchi  @xcite .    in general , matheron s conjecture is false , as the author  @xcite proved by finding counterexamples in @xmath8 , for any @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , the covariogram of the cartesian product of convex sets @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the product of the covariograms of @xmath1 and @xmath6 .",
    "thus @xmath37 and @xmath38 have equal covariograms .",
    "however , if neither @xmath1 nor @xmath6 is centrally symmetric , then @xmath37 can not be obtained from @xmath39 through a translation or a reflection . to satisfy these requirements the dimension of both sets",
    "must be at least two and thus the dimension of the counterexamples is at least four .",
    "we note that these counterexamples can be polytopes but not @xmath40 bodies .",
    "for @xmath13-dimensional convex polytopes @xmath41 , goodey , schneider and weil @xcite prove that if @xmath41 is simplicial and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are in general relative position , the covariogram determines @xmath41 .",
    "up till now this was the only positive result available in dimension @xmath43 ( beside the positive result for all centrally symmetric convex bodies ) .",
    "in @xmath44 the `` cartesian product '' construction does not apply because any one - dimensional convex set is centrally symmetric .",
    "for the class of three - dimensional convex polytopes we are able to confirm matheron s conjecture .",
    "this answer , together with the counterexamples for @xmath7 , completely settles the covariogram problem for convex polytopes .",

    "the term synisothetic was suggested by p.  mcmullen .",
    "the previous theorem can be rephrased in these terms : if @xmath53 , then @xmath68 and @xmath69 are synisothetic .    in order to prove theorem  [ teorema_lmr ] we investigate two related problems",
    ". the presence of parallel facets of @xmath41 causes difficulties ( eliminated by the special assumption in  @xcite that @xmath41 and @xmath42 are in general relative position ) . to deal with this , a.  voli and r.  j.  gardner posed a generalization of matheron s question we call the _ cross covariogram problem_. to explain this , some terminology is needed . given two convex sets @xmath1 and @xmath6 in @xmath8 , the _ cross covariogram _",

    "we prove that the information given by these two functions can be decoupled and provides both @xmath81 and @xmath82 , up to an exchange between them .",

    "however , all this is not sufficient for our purpose and a detailed study of problem  [ jcpf ] is needed ; see remarks  [ rem_facce ] and  [ rem_facce_four ] for further comments .",
