    "understanding the origins of the chemical elements is a fundamental goal of contemporary astrophysics . as this understanding has advanced in recent years ,",
    "a few elements have been rather neglected .",
    "boron is one such element .",
    "a primary reason for its neglect has been that stellar absorption lines of the boron atom and ions are not detectable in spectra obtainable from the ground ; the low abundance of boron means that this element is detectable only through its strong resonance lines which are in the ultraviolet . the advance in ultraviolet stellar spectroscopy made possible by the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and its goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) has led to new data on the boron abundance of cool and hot stars .    pioneering work on stellar boron abundances was presented by boesgaard & heacox ( 1978 ) who analyzed the @xmath0 1362   resonance line in spectra of early - type stars observed with the _ copernicus _ satellite . to map the evolution of boron with metallicity it is necessary to observe unevolved metal - poor stars .",
    "since these are cool , boron detection has to be made using the atomic resonance lines .",
    "no advance in our knowledge of the boron abundance came with the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( iue ) satellite ( an attempt to detect the resonance lines near @xmath0 2497   in a metal - poor star was made by molaro 1987 ) .",
    "duncan , lambert , & lemke s ( 1992 ) detection and analysis of the @xmath0 2497 lines in three metal - poor stars observed with the ghrs has been followed by other studies of these lines  see edvardsson et al .",

    "continuum normalization is a difficult task in a crowded spectral region like this one . in principle , the hst spectra have been corrected for the spectrograph efficiency versus wavelength .",

    "therefore , we consider the available spectra of these stars ( including also bd @xmath105740 , for which we have not computed synthetic spectra ) to provide upper limits to the boron abundances .",
    "this consideration removes four important objects ( in terms of their low metallicities ) from the sample used to delineate the boron evolution .",

    "there remains the question as to whether the model represents adequately the real upper photosphere .",
    "errors in the uv opacity , departures from lte , or effects of convective overshoot and thermal inhomogeneities might contribute to the fact that the far uv synthetic spectra seem to need a higher metallicity to reproduce the observations .",

    "we also derived lte abundances for these stars using osmarcs models and the equivalent widths previously computed with kurucz model atmospheres .",

    "we have used a microturbulent velocity of 1 km s@xmath29 . for the most metal - poor stars analyzed the synthetic spectra have shown that the dependence of boron abundance on the microturbulence is negligible . in the most metal - rich stars of the sample , with higher boron abundances , the effect of changing the microturbulence by one additional km s@xmath29 induces a change of 15% in the equivalent widths of the lines .",

    "the very limited data on the boron abundance in disk stars suggests that the b versus fe trend follows the be versus fe trend such that b / be remains constant at @xmath10 .",
    "additional data for boron at these metallicities is crucial to confirm this and for a better understanding of the halo - disk transition .",
    "the meteoritic abundances ( grevesse , noels , & sauval 1996 ) give b / be @xmath167 in agreement with our result from metal - poor stars .",
    "bd @xmath168 3130 observed and analyzed here is the most metal - poor star for which a firm measurement of the boron abundance presently exists ( two slightly more metal - poor stars ",
    "bd @xmath169 and bd @xmath170 740  have been analyzed but we consider that the @xmath0 2497   line has not been positively identified in published spectra . ) our result and slightly revised results from other metal - poor stars establish the run of boron with iron for halo stars : the boron abundance increases linearly , with a slope @xmath171 , with the iron abundance . with beryllium abundances",
    "consistently derived for the same stars using the same atmosphere parameters , the b / be ratio is found to be @xmath10 .",
    "a direct interpretation of these results is that b and be in the halo were synthesized by spallation reactions between ambient protons and @xmath12s and high energy particles with a composition enriched in cno .",
    "the b / be ratio is in fine agreement with the predictions ( vangioni - flam et al .",
    "1996 ; ramaty et al . 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "this is a significant result because the predicted b / be ratio is largely independent of the details of the modeling of the spallation process being largely determined by laboratory measurements of spallation cross - sections .",
    "the linear trend of b ( and be ) with fe is dependent on the astrophysics of spallation in the halo but can be reproduced with plausible assumptions ( vangioni - flam et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "a consistent picture of boron synthesis has emerged for the halo of our galaxy .",
    "stars more metal - poor than bd @xmath168 3130 are now known but it will not be easy to extend measurements of boron abundance to these stars",
    ". the @xmath0 2497   line will be too weak in the warmest of these stars , as we have found for less extreme stars .",
    "some extension to lower metallicity will be possible for cool stars but for the fact that the candidate stars are faint requiring prohibitively long exposures with hst .",
    "almost certainly , the boron plateau signifying detection of primordial boron will elude us ; boron ( and beryllium ) from homogeneous and inhomogeneous big bangs is predicted to have an abundance 7 or 8 dex below the abundance found here for bd @xmath168 3130 ( thomas et al .",
