    "there are two types of devices based on carbon nanotubes ( nts ) that are currently intensely investigated .",
    "these are field - effect transistors and field emitters for flat panel displays and x - ray sources .",
    "although both types of devices were reported several years ago @xcite and significant improvement in their characterisitcs had been recently achieved   ( see _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the understanding of performance of these devices is far from complete .",
    "the prime reason for this is 1d - like geometry of nt - based transistors and field emitters . due to this geometry ,",
    "their electrostatics is qualitatively different from that in respective well - understood 2d counterparts .",
    "traditionally , electrostatics for particular geometry of nt transistor @xcite or field emitter @xcite is studied theoretically by employing a certain version of first - principle calculations .",
    "notable exceptions are refs .",
    "@xcite , in which classical electrostatics was used to describe the potential profile near the contact between metallic and semiconducting nts as well as the contact between nt and a metal .",
    "applicability of this description of the contact phenomena in nts was later questioned in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in general , it is not obvious whether or not , in terms of electrostatics , a nt of a small radius , @xmath3 , can be modeled by an infinitely thin sheet of electron gas wrapped into a cylinder . in other words , whether or not the potential distribution can be adequately described by the poisson equation with boundary conditions imposed at distance , @xmath3 , from the nt axis .",
    "positive answer to this question was recently given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the density - functional calculations of the extra charge distribution along the nt were shown to be in quantitative agreement with classical electrostatics analysis .",
    "in this situation , it is instructive to consider a model problem of the classical electrostatics of a nt , which allows for an _ analytical _ solution .",
    "qualitative features of this solution might then yield a valuable insight into electrostatics of realistic devices .",
    "such a problem is studied in the present paper .",
    "namely , we consider a nt in external electric field , @xmath0 , parallel to the nt axis .",
    "separation of variables in the poisson equation in this geometry is impossible .",
    "still , as we demonstrate below , presence of a small parameter , @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the nt length , allows one to obtain the _ asymptotically exact _ distribution of potential .",
    "we show that for _ metallic _ nt the density of induced charge changes linearly with distance from the nt center . for _ semiconducting _ nt with a gap , @xmath4 , charge separation , which occurs as @xmath0 exceeds the threshold value @xmath8 , results in formation of a",
    "_ neutral strip _ with a width @xmath9 in the center of the nt .",
    "we find the profile of the charge density growth from the edges of the strip towards the nt ends .",
    "finally , we use the developed approach to describe quantitatively the electrostatics of bent or wiggly nts in external field , pertinent to recent electroabsorption measurements @xcite , and demonstrate that wiggling results in multiple alternating positively and negatively charged regions separated by neutral strips .",
    "denote with @xmath10 the _ linear _ density of charge , induced by external field on the nt surface .",
    "then the local value of the fermi momentum is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 accounts for the spin and band degeneracy ( @xmath13 or @xmath14 , and is determined by the nt chirality ) .",
    "the local chemical potential , @xmath15 , is related to @xmath16 via the nt energy spectrum @xmath17 where @xmath18 cm / s is the electron velocity in graphene .",
    "second relation between @xmath15 and @xmath10 expresses the fact that the electrochemical potential remains constant along the nanotube , i.e. @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the electrostatic potential @xmath21 which is created by external field and by induced charges .",

    "( [ closed ] ) as follows @xmath28 where the function @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30.\\ ] ] our most important observation is that , in the limit @xmath31 , the function @xmath29 can be replaced by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the step - function .",
    "possibility of such a replacement is illustrated in fig .  1",
    ".    a simple from of @xmath29 allows for a drastic simplification of eq .",
    "( [ closed ] ) , which transforms from intergral equation to a simple algebraic ( quadratic ) equation . in particular case ,",
    "@xmath34 ( metallic nt ) , we obtain the following result for the induced charge distribution @xmath35 where we have introduced a dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath36 . the above result for @xmath10",
    "has a logarithmic accuracy , in the sense , that numerical factor in the argument of logarithm is not specified .",
    "in particular , the _ height _ of the step - function in fig .",
    "1 contains @xmath37 under the logarithm .",
    "another contribution to the argument of logarithm comes from the _ smearing _ of the step - function in fig .  1 .",

    "the _ resulting _ field at the nt surface is _ normal _ to this surface .",
    "the opposite limit , @xmath49 , of a `` short '' nanotube , when external field is altered weakly by the induced charges , can not be achieved even for high dielectric constant of the substrate , _",

    "( [ closed ] ) within the `` local '' approximation .",
    "there are two sources of corrections to this result : classical and quantum .",
    "classical correction originates from the fact that for small @xmath4 the neutral strip is surrounded by long charged regions with opposite signs of charge . setting @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ closed ] ) , and substituting into the rhs the zero - order result ( [ long ] ) for @xmath10 , we obtain the following modified equation for @xmath63 @xmath64 the second term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ modified ] ) reflects the fact that potentials , created by the left and right charged neighbors of the neutral strip , do not compensate each other completely . as follows from eq .",
    "( [ modified ] ) , the relative classical correction to the position of the boundary , @xmath63 , is @xmath65 .",
    "this correction is small provided that @xmath66 .",
    "the latter condition also insures that the underlying energy spectrum of the nt is not affected by @xmath0 , as was assumed in derivation of our basic equation ( [ closed ] ) .",
    "quantum correction to @xmath63 comes from the penetration of electronic wave functions into the classically forbidden region inside the neutral strip . using zener s formula for tunneling exponent in the dirac spectrum ( [ spectrum ] )",
    ", the relative quantum correction can be presented in the form , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 has the meaning of the exciton bohr radius .",
    "thus , the condition of smallness of the quantum correction to @xmath63 coincides with the condition that @xmath0 is weaker than the ionization threshold for an exciton .",
    "experimental situations in which electrostatics of a charged nt is important are listed in ref .",
    "classical electrostatic analysis of a charged nt was carried out in this paper only for a short nt ( with @xmath70 ) .",
    "below we find the distribution of charge analytically in the limit @xmath31 . for a charged metallic nt",
    "the condition of a constant electrochemical potential takes the form @xmath71 now @xmath10 is even . to employ the above ansatz , we take derivative from the both sides of eq .",

    "the tubes usually have wiggly shapes .",
    "then their response to the external field can be quite peculiar , with numerous alternating positively and negatively charged regions separated by neutral strips ( see fig .",
    "3a ) . an insight into electrostatics of a wiggly nt can be drawn from a model example that allows for exact solution .",
    "we consider a nt in the form of a semicircle of a radius , @xmath80 . in two limiting cases , the electric field is either pointed along the diameter connecting the nt tips ( parallel geometry ) or perpendicular to this diameter ( perpendicular geometry , see fig .  3 ) .",

    "the constant , @xmath83 , which determines the electrochemical potential of nt , must be found from the condition of the net nt neutrality , @xmath84 .",
    "we emphasize that in _ both _ the parallel and perpendicular geometries only the tangent component of electric field is responsible for the charge separation .",
    "the normal component field has no effect on the charge separation if the condition @xmath85 is satisfied .",
    "the latter condition means that field - induced mixing of transverse subbands is negligible .",
    "\\(i ) in parallel geometry , we have @xmath86 .",
    "thus , @xmath87 is _ odd _ , so that @xmath88 .",
    "same ansatz as for a straight nt , yields the following solution of eq .",
    "( [ closed_bent_perp ] ) for @xmath34 @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "it is also easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ closed_bent_perp ] ) that , for finite @xmath4 , the neutral strip occupies the segment @xmath90 of the nt near its top ( fig .",

    "( [ by ] ) that was used for the straight charged nt .",
    "in particular , for @xmath34 we obtain @xmath93 the _ two _ points at which @xmath87 changes the sign are therefore located at @xmath94 . for a finite @xmath4 two neutral strips are formed around @xmath95 .",
    "their boundaries , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , ( see fig .",
    "3c ) are determined by the conditions @xmath98 when the gap is small , @xmath99 , the centers of the strips are still located near @xmath100 , while the strip width , @xmath101 , can be found directly from eq .",
    "( [ pm ] ) , namely @xmath102 .    for small ratio @xmath103",
    "it is also easy to trace the crossover between the parallel and perpendicular geometries as the field is rotated . for rotation angle , @xmath104 , and for @xmath34 , a straightforward generalization of eq .",
    "( [ perp ] ) yields the following angular dependence of the charge density @xmath105 $ ] . from this dependence",
    "we conclude that , as @xmath104 decreases from @xmath106 ( parallel geometry ) , the narrow neutral strip at the top of semicircle moves to the left . at critical @xmath107 , when the neutral strip is located around @xmath108 , the second neutral strip emerges at the right end of the nt .",
    "as @xmath104 decreases further , both neutral strips move to the left and assume their `` perpendicular '' positions @xmath109 .",
    "in ref .   the potential distribution along the nt was measured using the atomic force microscope . experimentally measured profile of the voltage drop in the structures with a small contact resistance",

    ". measurements of electroabsorption in single - walled carbon nts were recently reported in ref .  .",
    "it might seem that with photon energy @xmath115ev much bigger than @xmath4 the large - scale nanotube geometry is not important .",
    "this , however , is not the case .",
    "the reason is that the dipole moment of the many - body optical transition @xcite is directed _ along _ the tube @xcite . even if external field is parallel to the tube axis , the _ resulting _ field is almost perpendicular to the nanotube surface , and thus its effect on the optical transitions is suppressed",
    "this strong suppression by a factor @xmath116 $ ] must be taken into account when the oscillator strength is extracted from electroabsorption @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , within the neutral strip , the acting field is equal to the applied field .",
    "however , the relative contribution , @xmath117 , of neutral strips to the absorption is small .",
