    "bl lacs are a rare subclass of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) characterized by nearly featureless optical spectra , multiwavelength emission , marked variability and strong polarization ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) tend to be dominated by synchrotron radiation , with a component due to inverse compton scattering at higher frequencies .",
    "the standard paradigm describes bl lacs in the context of agn unification as fr i radio galaxies with their relativistic jets pointed toward the observer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this scenario the observed jets are brightened through beaming effects , making bl lacs powerful probes of agn jet physics and radio - loud agn in general .",
    "their rarity and lack of strong spectral features historically render many traditional quasar selection techniques ( e.g. , uv - excess or objective prism surveys ) inefficient .",
    "still , large bl lac samples are eagerly sought but until relatively recently have remained elusive ; given their strong multiwavelength continuous emission and rarity , broad - band recovery methods over large regions of the sky tend to be the most efficient .",
    "bl lac studies are sensitive to selection biases and historically have been limited by small number statistics .",
    "for example , a now disfavored dichotomy between radio selected bl lacs ( rbls ) and x - ray selected bl lacs ( xbls ) was initially suggested from a comparison between the small and relatively shallow but complete 1 jy radio sample @xcite and an x - ray selected sample from the _ einstein _ observatory extended medium - sensitivity survey ( emss ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition to xbls appearing to have less rapid variability and smaller nuclear to host galaxy flux ratios , rbls and xbls were thought to populate distinctly different regions of parameter space ( e.g. , see figure 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "xbls are also more weakly polarized on average , and the majority of xbls have constant polarization position angles ( within 20@xmath0 ) over timescales of at least 3 years @xcite .",
    "but @xcite  argue against two distinct bl lac populations , and they instead propose that the observed differences between rbls and xbls could be explained via different energy cutoffs in the beamed synchrotron radiation component of their seds .",
    "they suggest a more physical naming scheme of _ low - energy cutoff bl lac _ ( lbl ) and _ high - energy cutoff bl lac _ ( hbl ) to replace rbl and xbl .",
    "lbls have energy cutoffs in the near - infrared / optical , while hbls have energy cutoffs in the uv / x - ray .",
    "most but not all rbls are lbls in this scenario , and similarly most xbls are hbls .",
    "deeper surveys have subsequently found many objects , aptly named _ intermediate - energy cutoff bl lacs _",
    "( ibl ) , that bridge this lbl / hbl gap ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thereby demonstrating the apparent dichotomy s emergence as a selection effect .",
    "however , any model advocating a single bl lac population is still challenged with explaining the phenomenological differences between rbls and xbls described in the previous paragraph .",
    "large and deep samples are clearly essential for advancing our knowledge on bl lacs ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and much progress has been made over the past 10 - 15 years : the number of known bl lacs has ballooned from only a couple hundred @xcite to about 1100 catalogued in @xcite .",
    "numerous selection techniques have been used to assemble sizable bl lac samples .",
    "one multifrequency selection approach identifies candidates based on flat radio spectra , followed by requisite optical spectroscopy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while another popular technique assembles catalogs via the indentification of optical counterparts to radio and/or x - ray error circles in various surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while these combined radio / x - ray selected samples include a significant fraction of ibls in addition to lbls and hbls , they are of course sensitive to the varying flux limits and biases inherent to each multiwavelength survey .    one practical limitation to recovering a large uniform sample from imaging surveys as described above is performing the necessary optical spectroscopic follow - up for ( easily ) thousands of candidates , among which only @xmath1 are typically actual bl lacs .",
    "it has been noted that bl lacs tend to have characteristic x - ray - to - optical and optical - to - radio flux ratios differentiating them ( at least statistically ) from other radio / x - ray sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this feature has been exploited to increase the efficiency of bl lac search algorithms by targeting radio / x - ray sources with broad - band flux ratios indicative of known bl lacs .",
    "notably , the _ einstein _ slew survey @xcite and the sedentary multifrequency survey @xcite adopted this approach to recover large uniform bl lac samples ( @xmath260  in the case of the _ einstein _ survey and @xmath2150  in the final sedentary sample . )",
    "while such broad - band color selection approaches can recover lbls , ibls and hbls , it has been noted that the broad - band sed of bl lacs can vary largely from object to object , and this selection approach is prone to missing some bl lac subpopulations potentially in large numbers @xcite .",
    "it should be noted however that the _ einstein _ slew survey produced the first _",
    "bl lac sample containing a sizable number of lbls , ibls _ and _ hbls from a single selection technique ; the sedentary sample intentionally only attempted to recover hbls , and it nicely complements other surveys more sensitive to lbls ( particularly the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ; * ? ? ?",

    "this sample is one of the largest bl lac samples yet assembled .",
    "we also recently published in @xcite a 266 object x - ray sample selected jointly from sdss spectroscopy and from the rosat all sky survey ( rass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our x - ray sample recovered lbls , ibls and hbls , and a post - selection correlation with first and the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) revealed only 7 objects currently lacking radio detections ( possibly , but not certainly , because their radio emission lies below the first / nvss catalog flux limits . )",
    "both our separate sdss / first and sdss / rass samples are large with similar systematics given their similar recovery methods in sdss .",
    "these samples therefore provide an interesting opportunity for comparing radio and x - ray selected bl lacs in a uniform manner .",
    "the sheer size of our sdss / first sample , when supplemented by a rigorous understanding of selection biases among the different wavebands , may eventually permit application to a range of bl lac topics , from agn unification , to host galaxy properties , to bl lac evolution .",
    "our purpose here is to present our radio selected sample with some preliminary analysis .",

    "we select bl lac candidates from the combination of the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ) spectroscopic database @xcite in the optical , and from the first survey catalog @xcite in the radio .",

    "further technical details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the sdss dr5 spectroscopic database contains spectra for @xmath2@xmath15  objects over @xmath2@xmath16  deg@xmath9 , and the dr5 quasar catalog @xcite  contains 77,429 quasars with reliable spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "our selection process identifies a very small fraction of objects ( @xmath17 ) in the dr5 quasar catalog as bl lacs ( see  [ sec : catalog ] ) .",
    "the first radio survey imaged approximately the same 10@xmath18  deg@xmath9  of the north galactic cap in the vla s b configuration ( 5@xmath19 resolution ) at 1.4 ghz .",
    "three - minute snapshots were co - added together , and sources were extracted via specialized algorithms ( see * ? ? ? * ) with a catalog flux limit of 1 mjy and positional uncertainties better than @xmath20 .",
    "the first survey is by design well suited both in sky coverage and depth for matching optical counterparts in sdss , and about one - third of first sources have detectable optical counterparts in the sdss photometric survey @xcite .",
    "there are 37,456 objects in the sdss dr5 spectroscopic database that are flagged as first radio sources .",
    "the target selection algorithms for follow - up sdss spectroscopy are well suited for recovering bl lacs .",
    "please refer to @xcite for a thorough discussion .",
    "briefly , one goal of the sdss is to identify optical counterparts to @xmath210@xmath18  rass x - ray sources .",
    "at least one source with @xmath21  or  @xmath22  within many @xmath2@xmath23 rass error circles is targeted for spectroscopy .",
    "this x - ray counterpart algorithm targets many bl lacs , as sources whose sdss positions additionally match within 2@xmath19 to a first source are given highest priority , followed by objects with quasar - like or otherwise strange sdss colors .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic sample is even more advantageous for bl lac recovery in that bl lac spectra are additionally obtained through other quasar , serendipity , or galaxy spectroscopic target selection algorithms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although one might initially expect that our emphasis on radio detection for inclusion would bias our sample toward excess lbls , we do not believe this is an important concern .",
    "it is true that by requiring a detection in first we are prone to missing some bl lacs .",
    "for example , some regions of the sky might not have data coverage in first ; and , some bl lacs with sdss spectroscopy might have been in a low flux state during the first observations and would therefore be missed ; also , we are not highly sensitive to the radio - weak / quiet tail of the bl lac population .",
    "while very interesting , radio - weak / quiet bl lacs must be extremely rare if they exist ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; omission of a few would not affect our sample in a statistical sense .",
    "however , most bl lacs at the faint flux limit for sdss spectroscopy ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , or @xmath26 ) will have radio fluxes larger than the 1 mjy flux limit of the first survey at 1.4 ghz . figure [ fig : sed ] shows typical seds for an lbl , an ibl , and an hbl ( seds were kindly provided by elina nieppola , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a solid line , dotted line , and dashed line respectively ; the seds are normalized to @xmath27 .",
    "overplotted as black squares with arrows are typical flux limits for first , sdss spectroscopy , and rass from left to right , respectively .",
    "so , while it is likely there are some bl lacs with sdss spectroscopy not detected in first , we do not appear to be significantly biasing our sample toward or against one particular bl lac subclass by applying the radio flux limit to our selection criteria .",
    "note , however , that applying the rass flux limit ( taken from @xcite  as 2.5@xmath2810@xmath29  erg  s@xmath5  @xmath30  from 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) would bias our sample toward hbls .",
    "while we do not explicitly apply this flux limit , it does play a role in determining which objects are targeted for sdss spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , objects in bl lac samples derived from sdss spectroscopy could be biased toward hbls ( see  [ sec : disc ] and also @xcite ) .",
    "the relatively higher rass flux limit could also explain why we recover almost twice as many bl lac candidates from first / sdss as @xcite did from rass / sdss over the same area of the sky .",
    "approximate flux limits for first in the radio ( 1 mjy at 1.4 ghz ) , sdss spectroscopy in the optical ( @xmath31 ) , and rass in the x - ray ( @xmath22.5@xmath2810@xmath29  erg  s@xmath5  @xmath30 from 0.1 - 2.4 kev , see @xcite ) are shown as squares with arrows from left to right , respectively . at the optical spectroscopic flux limit",
    ", we do not expect to miss many bl lacs by imposing a radio flux limit , unless the sdss object does not overlap with the first survey s sky coverage , or if the object was in a low flux state during the first observations .",
    "note that applying the rass flux limit could bias our sample toward hbls .",
    "although we do not formally impose an x - ray flux limit to our sample , the rass flux limit is implicit in the sdss spectroscopic target algorithms .",
    "the rass flux limit therefore could affect the makeup of our sample ( see  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "our conclusion remains unchanged if we choose to normalize each sed to @xmath24  or @xmath32 . ]",
    "following the process detailed below , we impose the following criteria for bl lac selection : 1 ) the sdss position matches within 2@xmath19  to a first radio source ; 2 ) sdss spectroscopy shows no emission line with a rest - frame equivalent width ( @xmath33 ) larger than 5    ( see  [ sec : maninspect ] ) ; and 3 ) the  h / k  break ( if present ) has a measured depression @xmath34 .",
    "the  h / k  depression parameter @xmath35 describes the fractional change in continuum blueward and redward of 4000    ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37  and @xmath38  refer to the average fluxes per unit frequency just blueward ( 3750 - 3950  ) and just redward ( 4050 - 4250  ) of the h / k break respectively . the quantities @xmath39  and @xmath40  similarly refer to the average fluxes per unit wavelength .",
    "these spectral constraints are commonly used in the recent literature , and they are consistent with , albeit more restrictive than , those introduced by @xcite .",
    "we also take additional precautions to reject objects that might formally pass these criteria but are not bl lacs ( e.g. , stars , post - starburst galaxies , obvious broad absorption line quasars , etc . ; see  [ sec : contaminants ] ) .",
    "we note that our adopted selection criteria are empirically based and thus somewhat arbitrary ( e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite for relevant discussions pertaining to selection issues ) . for example",
    ", there is no definitive  h / k break value that serves as an obvious transition between beamed and unbeamed radio galaxies . and",
    ", we could be missing some nearby low - luminosity bl lacs , as described by the browne - march effect @xcite : weakly beamed bl lacs could be so dominated by starlight from their host galaxies that they are misidentified as radio galaxies or as clusters of galaxies .  as the h / k break cutoff instead of the more restrictive value of 0.25 used in some older samples .",
    "] we discuss potential contamination from radio galaxies and clusters of galaxies in sections [ sec : radgal ] and [ sec : clustgal ] respectively .",
    "also , bl lacs with significant host galaxy contamination can have @xmath33 s that are measured to be larger than 5   when referenced to their starlight contaminated continua instead of only their agn continua @xcite .",
    "our selection approach misses such objects . despite these well - studied issues ,",
    "our adopted spectral criteria are also commonly applied in much of the recent literature .",
    "the sdss pipeline s measurements of spectral features ( e.g. , redshifts , line equivalent widths , h / k breaks , etc . )",
    "are of course only useful if the pipeline estimates the correct redshift .",
    "the pipeline redshifts are quite reliable for objects with strong spectral features ( e.g. , over 98% of the pipeline redshifts were accurate for the objects in the dr5 quasar catalog ) , but one should not blindly trust the redshifts for such weak - featured objects as bl lacs .",
    "we therefore placed lenient restrictions on our initial database query to ensure high completeness at the cost of an initially large false positive rate .",
    "we ran the following two - part query ( followed by manual inspection of all sdss spectra , see  [ sec : maninspect ] ) :    1 .",
    "we return all sdss spectra within 2@xmath19  of a first source for which the pipeline has little confidence in the measured redshift .",
    "this is achieved by selecting all spectra ( that are not blank sky for calibration ) that the database flags speczstatus as ` not_measured ' or ` failed ' .",
    "this query returned 589 spectra .",
    "2 .   for those objects with more confident pipeline redshifts ( i.e. , speczstatus  @xmath41  ` not_measured ' or ` failed ' ) , we return all spectra within 2@xmath19  to a first source with the conservative constraints that ( i ) no emission line ( of ly@xmath42 , , ] ,",
    ", h@xmath43 , [ ] , or h@xmath42 ) has a pipeline measured @xmath44   , and ( ii ) the h / k break ( if present ) has a pipeline measured @xmath45 . this query returned 1803 spectra .",
    "not every spectrum in this set has a reliable pipeline redshift .",
    "however , as expected , essentially all spectra lacking reliable pipeline redshifts also have very weak spectral features , and our query correctly retains these objects . objects with spectral features too strong to be considered bl lacs have correct pipeline redshifts in the vast majority of cases and are therefore rejected by the query as intended .    out of @xmath237,000 total first matches in the dr5 spectroscopic database ,",
    "our query yielded 2392 spectra as potential bl lac candidates .",
    "we do not consider x - ray information for selection .",
    "however , if an sdss source matches within @xmath23  to a rass source , we also keep track of its x - ray properties listed in the dr5 database .",
    "we run two tests to check that our database query returns the vast majority of previously - known sdss bl lacs .",
    "first , we compare our query results to @xcite s 183 probable sdss optically selected bl lac candidates that are additionally flagged as first radio sources in their catalog .",
    "@xcite  similarly require @xmath46  and @xmath47   , but their exact recovery method differs from ours .",
    "172 of their 183 first / sdss objects appear in the dr5 database as first sources and pass our signal - to - noise cut ( see  [ sec : signoise ] ) . of these 172 sources",
    ", our database query fails to recover only a single spectrum .",
    "we miss this spectrum because the pipeline measured a rew larger than 10    for an assumed feature that is likely just noise .",
    "second , we perform an identical query for x - ray selection by replacing the 2@xmath19  match to a first source with a 1@xmath48  positional match to a rass source .",
    "we then compare results from this x - ray query to the @xcite sdss / rass x - ray selected agn sample .",
    "@xcite  queried the dr5 spectroscopic database for sdss spectra that matched within 1@xmath48  to a rass source , placing no additional constraints on the pipeline measured spectral feature strengths or redshift flags .",
    "their manual inspection of the resulting 15,129 spectra yielded 266 x - ray selected bl lac candidates ( also defined by @xmath47    and @xmath49 ) .",
    "our revamped x - ray query ( i.e. , including cuts on equivalent width and h / k break ) weeds the @xmath210@xmath18  sdss / rass positional coincidences in dr5 to @xmath22000 objects ; we recovered all but 3 spectra included in the @xcite  bl lac sample .",
    "the missed objects include a borderline bl lac candidate with @xmath50  exactly ( as measured by @xcite ; the sdss pipeline measured @xmath51 ) , and two examples where the pipeline overestimated a single emission line s @xmath33  because the line lies in an abnormally noisy spectral regime .",
    "although our database query is by design inefficient , we conclude that it is excellent in producing a manageable number of candidates while retaining essentially all previously - identified bl lac objects in the dr5 spectroscopic database .",
    "we apply a signal - to - noise cut to the sdss spectra of potential bl lacs , similar to @xcite .",
    "we calculate the signal to noise over three separate 500    wavelength regions centered on 4750 , 6250 , and 7750    ( each wavelength region typically contains approximately 450 , 350 and 300 pixels respectively ) ; these spectral regions are typically high - quality and fall within the @xmath52  and @xmath53  filters respectively . over each spectral region",

    "<S> we present a large sample of 501  radio - selected bl lac candidates from the combination of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 5 optical spectroscopy and from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ) radio survey ; this is one of the largest bl lac samples yet assembled , and each object emerges with homogeneous data coverage . </S>",
    "<S> each candidate is detected in the radio from first and confirmed in sdss optical spectroscopy to have : ( 1 ) no emission feature with measured rest equivalent width larger than 5   ; and ( 2 ) no measured h / k depression larger than 40% . </S>",
    "<S> we subdivide our sample into 426  higher confidence candidates and 75  lower confidence candidates . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that contamination from other classes of objects that formally pass our selection criteria is small , and we identify a few very rare radio agn with unusual spectra that are probably related to broad absorption line quasars . </S>",
    "<S> about one - fifth of our sample were known bl lacs prior to the sdss . </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary analysis of the sample generally supports the standard beaming paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> while we recover sizable numbers of low - energy and intermediate - energy cutoff bl lacs ( lbls and ibls , respectively ) , there are indications of a potential bias toward recovering high - energy cutoff bl lacs ( hbls ) from sdss spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> such a large sample may eventually provide new constraints on bl lac unification models and their potentially peculiar cosmic evolution ; in particular , our sample contains a significant number of higher redshift objects , a sub - population for which the standard paradigm has yet to be rigorously constrained . </S>"
