    "the idea that the uncertainty principle would be affected by the quantum gravity has been suggested couple decades ago @xcite . should the theories of quantum gravity , such as string theory , doubly special relativity and black hole physics be confirmed , our understanding of the basic laws and principles of physics turn to be considerably different , especially at very high energies or short distances @xcite .",

    "the existence of a minimal length is one of the most interesting predictions of such new physics .",
    "these can be seen as the consequences of the string theory , since strings can not interact at distances smaller than their size which leads to a generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the black hole physics suggests that the uncertainty relation should be modified near the planck s energy scale because of measuring the photons emitted from the black hole suffers from two major errors .",

    "<S> the effects of generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) on the inflationary dynamics and the thermodynamics of the early universe are studied . using the gup approach , the tensorial and scalar density fluctuations in the inflation era </S>",
    "<S> are evaluated and compared with the standard case . </S>",
    "<S> we find a good agreement with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data . assuming that a quantum gas of scalar particles is confined within a thin layer near the apparent horizon of the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker universe which satisfies the boundary condition , the number and entropy densities and the free energy arising form the quantum states are calculated using the gup approach . a qualitative estimation for effects of the quantum gravity on all these thermodynamic quantities is introduced . </S>"
