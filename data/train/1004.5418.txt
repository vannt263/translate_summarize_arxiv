    "suppose we have a sample of a population , such that for every subject @xmath1 in the sample we observe a vector of explanatory variables @xmath0 while a scalar response @xmath2 is missing by happenstance on some individuals .",
    "a classical problem is to construct consistent estimators for the mean value of the response based on the observed data . in order to identify the parameter of interest in terms of the distribution of observed data , missing at random ( mar )",
    "is assumed .",
    "this hypothesis establishes that the value of the response does not provide additional information , on top of that given by the explanatory variables , to predict whether an individual will present a missing response ( see rubin @xcite ) . to be more rigorous ,",
    "let us introduce a binary variable @xmath3 such that @xmath4 whenever the response is observed for subject @xmath1 .",
    "in this way , mar states that@xmath5 under this condition , if @xmath6 , we have that@xmath7=\\mathrm{e}\\left [   \\frac{a_{i}y_{i}}{\\pi(\\mathbf{x}_{i})}\\right ]   , \\label{ipw}\\ ] ] where @xmath8@xmath9 , and identifiability of @xmath10 $ ] holds .",
    "one approach to estimate consistently @xmath10 $ ] , called inverse probability weight ( ipw ) , is based on ( [ ipw ] ) and requires to estimate the propensity score function @xmath11 .",
    "then , the estimate of @xmath10 $ ] can be obtained replacing in ( [ ipw ] ) @xmath12 by its estimate and the expectation by its empirical version .",
    "mar also implies that the conditional distribution of the responses given the vector of explanatory variables remains the same , regardless of the fact that the response is also observed : @xmath13",
    ". then @xmath14=\\mathrm{e}[y_{i}|\\mathbf{x}_{i},a_{i}=1]$ ] .",
    "since @xmath10=\\mathrm{e}\\left [   \\mathrm{e}[y_{i}|\\mathbf{x}_{i}]\\right ] $ ] , a second approach to estimate @xmath10 $ ] is based  on a regression model ( parametric or nonparametric ) for @xmath14=g(\\mathbf{x}_{i})$ ] , which is fitted using only the individuals for whom the response is observed",
    ".  then a second estimate for @xmath10 $ ] is obtained by averaging @xmath15 over the whole sample , where @xmath16 is an estimate of @xmath17 .",
    "there is third approach ( doubly protected ) that  postulates models for @xmath18 and @xmath19  and obtains a consistent estimate of @xmath10 $ ] if at least one of the two models is correct .",
    "a recent survey and discussion on these three approaches can be found in kan and schafer @xcite  and robins , sued , lei - gomez and rotnitzky @xcite .",
    "as it is well known , the mean is not a robust location parameter , i.e. , a small change in the population distribution may have a large effect on this parameter . as a consequence of this ,",
    "the mean does not admit consistent non - parametric robust estimates , except when strong properties on the distribution are assumed , as for example symmetry .",
    "for this reason , to introduce robustness in the present setting , we start by reformulating the statistical object of interest : instead of estimating the mean value of the response , we look for consistent estimates of  @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a robust location functional and @xmath22 is the distribution of @xmath2 .",
    "bianco , boente , gonzalez - manteiga and perez - gonzalez @xcite used this approach to obtain robust and consistent estimates of an m location parameter of the distribution of @xmath2 . in their treatment they assumed a partially linear model to describe the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath0 , and also that the distributions of the  response @xmath2 and of the regression error under the true model are both symmetric .    in this paper we introduce a new estimate of any continuous location functional assuming that the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath0 is given by means of a semiparametric regression model .",
    "we show that once the regression model is fitted using robust estimates , we can define a consistent estimate of the distribution function of the response .",
    "then , any parameter of the response distribution defined throughout a weak continuous functional , may be also consistently estimated by evaluating the functional at the estimated distribution function .",
    "the consistency of this procedure does not require the symmetry assumptions used by bianco et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a robust fit for the regression model combined with the robust properties of the location functional to be considered , gives rise to a robust recipe for estimating the location parameter .",
    "robustness is quantified looking at breakdown point  of the proposed procedure .",
    "in particular our results can be applied when the location functional is the median or an mm location functional .",
    "the proposed procedure may be considered as a robust extension of the second approach described above for estimating @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "we have not found a way to robustify the approaches that use the propensity score @xmath23 .",
    "the main difficulty in such cases is to obtain a consistent procedure avoiding the assignment of very large weights to those observations with very small @xmath24 .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we formalize the problem of the robust estimation of a location parameter with missing data .",
    "we propose a family of procedures which depend on the location functional to be estimated and also on the robust regression estimate for the parameter of the regression model postulated to describe the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in section 3",
    "we show that , under some assumptions on the location functional and the regression estimate , the proposed estimates are strongly consistent and asymptotically normal . in section 4",
    "we study the breakdown point of the proposed estimates . in section 5",
    "we show that when the location and regression estimates are of mm type , the assumptions that guarantee consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimates are satisfied .",
    "in section 6 we present the results of a monte carlo study which shows that the proposed estimates are highly efficient under gaussian errors and highly robust under outlier contamination .",
