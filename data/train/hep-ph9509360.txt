    "the formulation of qcd , or any other field theory , at finite temperature is well - established and several equivalent approaches exist .",
    "nevertheless , since finite temperature systems are determined not only by their ground states but also by all the excited states , the study of finite temperature field theory really involves different physics with respect to the zero temperature case and different concepts need to be introduced  @xcite .    in the existing literature",
    "the real - time dynamics is mainly discussed in a perturbative context .",
    "however , we are often interested in non - perturbative real - time physics . typical non - perturbative methods for qcd calculation at finite @xmath0 are the operator product expansion and lattice simulations . both these approaches are intrinsically euclidean and limited to static properties .",
    "the possibility of extracting real - time information from these euclidean quantities needs to be addressed . due to the lack of experimental data",
    ", we do not have enough intuition to guide our approaches .",
    "therefore , it is particularly useful to have some exact results which could provide us with insights into such matter .",
    "however , demanding exact solutions often implies a sacrifice in the direct phenomenological relevance .    in this paper",
    ", we address these issues in the u(1 ) chirally symmetric gross - neveu model  @xcite in @xmath3 dimensions and in the large-@xmath1 limit : this soluble model allows us to perform exact calculations both for real - time and screening dynamics .",
    "this model is often used in the literature  @xcite whenever exact results are required and , besides , some relevance to qcd is also desired .",
    "in fact , the gross - neveu model has several features in common with qcd .",
    "for instance , this model undergoes a chiral phase transition at finite @xmath0 , as it is expected to happen in qcd , providing a good place for a qualitative modeling of the temperature dependence of real - time dynamics .",
    "however , some caution is needed : the gross - neveu model is not confining and , therefore , not every physical interpretation of the singularities associated to quark and antiquark can be literarily applied to qcd .",
    "more specifically , we solve the real - time bound state and study its properties as functions of temperature .",
    "we calculate its mass , its coupling constant , its decay constant and its spectral function .",
    "in addition , we carefully characterize the size of this bound state by calculating its on - shell form factor .",
    "similarly , we also solve the corresponding screening state by calculating the screening mass , coupling , decay constant , and the screening bethe - salpeter amplitude .",
    "the choice of screening observables , and of the corresponding real - time ones , has been suggested from the available lattice calculations  @xcite .",
    "eventually , we contrast the real - time observables and the corresponding screening ones .    while some of the results presented here can be found in the existing literature , and we include them only to make the presentation of our points coherent and self - contained , others are less well - known . among these new , or insufficiently discussed , topics we would like to emphasize the following .",
    "+ ( 1 ) due to the lack of lorentz invariance at finite @xmath0 a general amplitude @xmath4 has often very different functional dependences on @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "an obvious consequence of this non - uniformness is , for example , the non - covariant energy - momentum dispersion relation for elementary excitations .",
    "a less obvious but more interesting consequence is related to how conservation laws due to some internal symmetries manifest themselves in various physical processes .",
    "the goldberger - treiman relation and the effective charge of the pion are used as illustrations .",
    "+ ( 2 ) to characterize the structure of a bound state at finite @xmath0 in a physical way we introduce the on - shell form factor in the elastic limit .",
    "the peculiarity of the relevant kinematic condition and the existence of an additional form factor are carefully addressed .",
    "then we isolate the singularity structure that characterizes the on - shell form factor as a function of the spatial momentum transfer and , therefore , determine the size of the bound state .",
    "+ ( 3 ) we derive an exact sum rule , which states that the zeroth moment of the pseudoscalar spectral function is temperature independent .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the screening bethe - salpeter amplitudes in scalar and pseudoscalar channels are calculated explicitly .",
    "+ ( 5 ) we obtain the asymptotic formula for the screening mass in the high-@xmath0 limit and show that this result demonstrates the failure of dimensional reduction in this model .",
    "the reason of this failure is also explained .",
    "strictly speaking , the 2 + 1 dimensional gross - neveu model with a continuous symmetry has no finite-@xmath0 phase transition beyond the leading order in @xmath7 , due to the severe infrared singularity associated with massless goldstone bosons .",
    "one might question the relevance of our results at leading order in @xmath7 .",
    "this problem can be avoided by working in @xmath8 spatial dimensions ( @xmath9 ) , where the infrared catastrophe is absent . since",
    "the limit @xmath10 is smooth at the leading order in @xmath7 , our results presented in this paper should be understood as such .",
    "we could have also addressed the same questions in the 3 + 1 dimensional nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite . however , since our present interest is more related to answering conceptual questions rather than finding direct phenomenological applications , we prefer to use the 2 + 1 gross - neveu model because of its renormalizability .",
    "moreover , we believe that the qualitative physics associated with the chiral restoration at finite @xmath0 is similar in all these models , independently of their dimensionality . in any case , we shall take notice of those results that are directly linked to the specific dimensionality .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ concl ] to a summary of our work and to conclusions .",
    "in this section we review the connection between correlation functions , which are the typical output of theoretical calculations , and the real - time response of a system to external perturbations .",
    "the following material is most likely well - known to experts  @xcite ; nonetheless , since we are specifically concerned with the proper interpretation of euclidean correlation functions , we find useful to include it here as a convenient reminder .",
    "an experimentalist perturbs a system with an external probe , and then measures the effect of this perturbation with some detector . in a given theory",
    "we describe this external perturbation using an interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the external perturbation , which is switched on at @xmath13 , and couples to the system through the current @xmath14 ( the hat indicates operators ) .",
    "the system is described by a state , or ensemble of states of the hamiltonian , and the measurement of the response to the perturbation is performed through another current , which can be the same as the one that couples to the perturbation . for example , we may perturb the system with an external electric field , which couples to the charge density , and measure the resulting change in the same charge density . therefore",
    ", we typically measure the change of the expectation value of a given current due to the presence of the perturbation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the expectation value of the operator @xmath17 in the state ( or ensemble of states ) describing the system in the presence of the external perturbation , and @xmath18 the corresponding expectation value in the unperturbed system . here and in the following",
    "we drop the spatial label for simplicity .",
    "if the perturbation is weak , we can expand in the perturbation , and keep only the term linear in the external field .",
    "then the linear response of the system to the perturbation is simply proportional to the retarded correlation function :    @xmath19    where the retarded correlation is defined as @xmath20\\right ) }                      { \\text{tr } \\left ( e^{-\\hat{h}_0/t}\\right ) } \\,\\ ] ] and @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the unperturbed hamiltonian , and we consider a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the physical content of this equation is known as the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , i.e. correlation functions of a system describe not only the correlations ( fluctuations ) of the system in a given channel , but also its linear response ( dissipation ) to weak external perturbations .",
    "we say that the system has a ( real - time ) elementary excitation in the channel described by a given current , if we get a resonant ( very large ) response to the corresponding external perturbation at a given frequency .",
    "if we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ linres ] ) in frequency - momentum space ( restoring the spatial dependence ) @xmath23 we can see that the appearance of a pole in the correlator as a function of @xmath24 gives this kind of resonant response , which will be called the bound state .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ freres ] ) that the resonance frequency depends on spatial momentum @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",
    "the function @xmath27 is the so - called dispersion relation for the excitation .    alternatively",
    ", we can use a time - independent external perturbation ( @xmath28 ) , and study the static response of the system . in this case",
    ", we are interested in the modification of the system in spatial distribution , e.g. how the effect of the perturbation dies out with distance ( screening ) . in momentum space there",
    "can still exist purely imaginary poles in the retarded correlator , but now they are interpreted as pure exponential terms in the decaying response . at zero temperature only , due to euclidean invariance for relativistic theories ,",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between these poles in the imaginary momentum and the ones in frequency .",
    "the resonant frequencies of the system ( poles of the propagator ) are important characteristics of the system , but they are not the only information we get from experiment ( and from the propagator ) .",
    "the strength with which the external probe couples to the system is also important .",
    "for instance , excitations of the system that do not couple to the external probe may not be relevant . in the propagator",
    ", the information about the coupling strength is carried by the residue of the pole at the resonant frequency .",
    "a nice example of the concepts we have just reviewed is the classic electron plasma probed through the charge density : @xmath29 .",
    "the response of the plasma to a static point charge is just the well - known debye screening @xmath30 and the corresponding pole in the static propagator , @xmath31 is the debye mass : @xmath32 ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the electron density and charge , respectively ) .",
    "but the plasma also possess real - time excitations , plasmons , with characteristic frequency @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the electron mass .",
    "these excitations are described , near the plasmon pole , by the green s function @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the damping rate which gives a finite width to the plasmon . the frequency - momentum ( or dispersion ) relation for plasmons is @xmath39 .    from the preceding example it is quite clear that in general real - time excitations and screening states describe different physics .",
    "nevertheless , there is a connection between measurements in minkowski and euclidean space .",
    "in general , causality and unitarity make possible the following dispersion relation for the correlation function @xmath40 where the spectral function @xmath41 is proportional to the total cross - section in the given channel .",
    "it is important to realize that the dispersion relation at finite @xmath0 is in frequency only and the spatial momentum is treated as a parameter . in the plasmon example , if the plasmon were the only excitation of the system , the spectral density @xmath41 would just be the on - shell condition for the plasmon : @xmath42 the power of the dispersion relation is that the physical content of the correlation is entirely embodied in the spectral function @xmath41 , which determines the correlation in the whole complex plane , apart from a possible additive polynomial in @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , if we analytically continue the correlation function to imaginary frequencies , we obtain @xmath43 this analytically continued correlation function calculated at the matsubara frequencies @xmath44 ( for fermions ) is the discrete fourier transform of the correlator calculated in the euclidean region ( finite temperature correlator ) : @xmath45\\right ) }                      { \\text{tr } \\left ( e^{-\\hat{h}_0/t}\\right ) } \\,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",
    "this formula is valid in the interval @xmath47 , while for @xmath48 outside this interval we can use the periodicity condition , which for fermions reads @xmath49 ( it follows from the periodicity of the trace and the anticommutation property of the fermionic fields ) .",
    "vice versa , if we know the correlation function at the discrete set of euclidean points specified by the matsubara frequencies , the analytic continuation @xmath50 provides us with the retarded / advanced correlation for continuous real - time frequency .",
    "this continuation is unique only when the expression of the correlation function is explicitly free of singularity in the entire @xmath24-plane except on the real axis and obeys certain convergence property at @xmath51  @xcite .    finally , due to the lack of lorentz invariance at finite @xmath0",
    ", a general green s function @xmath52 often has very different functional dependence on @xmath5 and on @xmath6 .",
    "for example , @xmath53 strongly depends on the order in which we take the limits @xmath54 and @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 is usually different from @xmath57 .",
    "( the innocent looking function @xmath58 in the limit of @xmath59 illustrates the relevant subtlety . )",
    "of course , the physics of the specific process selects which of the two order is relevant . in particular , @xmath60 is intrinsically minkowskian , because it represents a process whose characteristic time is much shorter than the heat - bath response - time . we shall then call this kind of processes fast processes",
    "correspondingly , @xmath61 is intrinsically euclidean and the related processes are called slow processes , since the thermal environment has enough time to respond to the external perturbation . as we will see later ,",
    "conservation laws due to internal symmetries only hold in fast processes . in slow processes the apparent violation of conservation laws",
    "should be understood in the sense of the grand canonical ensemble , not as the violation of the fundamental physics laws .",

    "( [ fpirt ] ) .",
    "the physical reason that the pion decay should be regarded as a fast process is that the decay happens instantaneously and the thermal environment does not have enough time to respond .    at this point",
    "it is appropriate to comment on the fact that it is not trivial how , at finite temperature , the conservation laws that are the consequence of symmetries of a theory manifest themselves in the real - time dynamics .",

    "therefore , one can not simply assume that euclidean ward identities immediately apply also to the on - shell quantities , as was done in ref .",

    "conservation laws hold explicitly . whereas in slow processes , where a measurement always involves the feedback of the heat bath , conservation laws are no longer manifest .",
    "we will encounter an example of such a `` violation '' in the next subsection .",
    "at any temperature the on - shell form factor in the elastic limit provides a physical measure of the size of an elementary excitation .",

    ", we scatter a lepton off the pion . just as in the usual zero temperature scattering",

    "nevertheless , we find again that , while @xmath208 loses its meaning above @xmath89 , the size defined through the screening bethe - salpeter amplitude does not give us any signal of this disappearance of the real - time state .",
    "we believe that most of the above - mentioned qualitative features will also be present in 3 + 1 dimensions , although some of the details presented here are certainly specific to this model .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that the screening observables , in general , do not necessarily reflect the behavior of the corresponding real - time observables .",
    "these two kinds of observables are often qualitatively different",
    ".      the present model study can also offer us very interesting information about the possibility of dimensional reduction for screening green functions at high temperature .    in the symmetric phase , equations  ( [ screenp ] ) and ( [ screens ] )",
    "coincide and can be rewritten as @xmath299 where @xmath300 . in the high-@xmath0 limit",
    "we can solve the above equation iteratively by setting @xmath301 .",
    "in particular , the first two coefficients can be easily found by solving @xmath302 and @xmath303^{3/2 } } \\tan^{-1}{c_0\\over\\sqrt{4(2n-1)^2-c_0 ^ 2 } } \\right\\ } \\ , .",
    "\\label{c1}\\ ] ] therefore , the asymptotic form for the screening masses in the high-@xmath0 limit is , @xmath304 numerically , @xmath305 and @xmath306 .",
    "( [ msasymp ] ) is plotted in dashed line in fig .",
    "a salient feature of this asymptotic behavior is that the high temperature limit of the screening mass is @xmath307 , where the numerical value of @xmath308 has contributions from all the matsubara frequency .",
    "if dimensional reduction took place in the high-@xmath0 limit , we would find that only the lowest ( or at most a finite number ) modes would contribute to @xmath308 .",
    "in fact , any truncation in the frequency sum in eq .",
    "( [ screenp ] ) , and then in eq .",
    "( [ c0 ] ) , would give a different @xmath308 : the resulting error in the screening mass would not be suppressed in the high-@xmath0 limit .",
    "the reason for the failure of the dimensional reduction picture is that the 2 + 1 dimensional gross - neveu model lacks the necessary scale hierarchy : there is no elementary bosonic particle whose zero mode could dominate over other modes of order @xmath0 , and the coupling constant can not provide a second lower scale compared to @xmath0 , as it happens in asymptotically free theory  @xcite , since this model has a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point",
    ". in fact , the high - momentum behavior of the dimensionless coupling @xmath309 has the form @xmath310 , with @xmath311 ( the value of @xmath312 is scheme dependent ) .",
    "this nontrivial fixed point implies that this dimensionless coupling `` runs '' , in the high temperature limit , to a finite value ( since @xmath313  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the effective interaction strength at high @xmath0 between all the matsubara modes ( @xmath314 , once the fields have been appropriately re - scaled ) is strong and its strength in units of @xmath0 becomes independent of temperature ( @xmath315 ) .    in this regard the gross - neveu model in 1 + 1 dimensions",
    "is very different from the one in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the 1 + 1 dimensional model is asymptotically free and @xmath316 runs to zero logarithmically , providing the scale hierarchy between @xmath0 and @xmath317  @xcite . in this model dimensional reduction takes place and screening quantities are well reproduced by the lowest modes that are weakly interacting : the leading contribution to the screening mass is given by the free theory , @xmath318 , the first correction to this non - interacting behavior is of the order @xmath316 and it is correctly reproduced by the reduced theory .",
    "since @xmath316 runs to zero the reduced theory becomes exact asymptotically .",
    "finally , we should point out that the concept of dimensional reduction that we have discussed in this subsection and in refs .",
    "@xcite , is different from the concept of dimensional reduction employed for predicting the nature of phase transitions at finite @xmath0 in the @xmath66-model scenario  @xcite .",
    "our criterion for dimensional reduction is more stringent and applies to a different temperature regime .",
    "we require that the static green s functions of the original theory at high-@xmath0 limit be matched by the corresponding green s functions in the reduced theory to a given accuracy , whereas in the @xmath66-model scenario one requires that the reduced theory be able to match the thermodynamical singularities near the critical region and hence give the same critical exponents .",
    "therefore , the success / failure of one of the two dimensional reduction pictures does not directly implies the success / failure of the other .",
    "we have shown in a specific example , the gross - neveu model in 2 + 1 dimensions , that the direct connection between the real - time bound state and the corresponding screening state is lost at finite temperature in general , especially near and above phase transition .",
    "in particular , the real - time pion disappears after the phase transition , as it is signaled by the vanishing of its bounding energy and of the coupling to its constituents @xmath144 . in spite of this , the corresponding screening state is still strongly `` bound '' in the high temperature limit , and the screening coupling @xmath258 grows linearly with @xmath0 .",
    "the screening mass approaches the asymptotic value of @xmath319 , which is much smaller than the sum of the masses of two noninteracting fermions , @xmath320 .",
    "moreover , the screening bethe - salpeter amplitude yields sizes of order @xmath218 both in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels at high @xmath0 , when the real - time bound state no longer exists . therefore , no relevant information about the nature of the real - time pion can be inferred from this screening amplitude . on the contrary , we can give a natural definition of the size of the real - time pion ( below the phase transition ) by means of the on - shell form factor in the elastic limit , since the on - shell form factor has direct information of the relevant coupling @xmath144 .",
    "furthermore , we show that the associated size can not be estimated solely from simple threshold considerations , reflecting the fact that the thermal environment tends to wash out coherence beyond thermal wavelength in slow ( compared to the equilibration time of the thermal bath ) processes .",
    "we have also computed the exact pseudoscalar spectral function of this model .",
    "the most important features of this spectral function are the diminishing of the strength of the pion pole and the magnification of the strength of the quark - antiquark continuum near the phase transition .",
    "in addition , we have derived an exact sum rule for this spectral function : the integrated strength of the spectral function is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "many of the features of the 2 + 1 dimensional gross - neveu model that we have listed above are dominated by the chiral symmetry and should have their analogues in the real world .",
    "for instance , very similar results were found in the 1 + 1 dimensional gross - neveu model  @xcite , and in the nambu - jona - lasinio model  @xcite in 3 + 1 dimensions . on the other hand",
    ", certain specific aspects certainly depend on the details of the theory .",
    "for example , we find that the 2 + 1 dimensional gross - neveu model does not undergo dimensional reduction in the high-@xmath0 limit . but the possibility of using a lower dimensional theory to describe static correlations of the original theory when @xmath0 is large is strictly tied to the short distance behavior , which is very different in this model from the one in qcd  @xcite .",
    "finally , we also find that it is instructive to classify physical processes according to their characteristic time scales relative to the time scale required by the thermal environment to respond to an external perturbation .",
    "we have explicitly illustrated , in the cases of the goldberger - treiman relation and of the effective charge of the pion , that conservation laws due to internal symmetries are manifest only in fast processes but not in slow ones .",
