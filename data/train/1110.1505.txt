    "the coexistence of a permanent electric , and magnetic dipole moment of the neutron , intrinsically violates both _",
    "t _ and _ p _ symmetry , and assuming _ cpt _ conservation also _",
    "cp_. the standard model  ( sm ) of particle physics gives a satisfactory account for _ p_-violation in weak interactions mediated by charged ( @xmath5 ) and neutral ( @xmath6 ) weak currents as well as for _ cp_-violation in the decay of k- and b - mesons .",
    "however , this source of _",
    "cp_-violation is far too weak to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "the discovery of a neutron electric dipole moment could thus help to explain and may even solve this discrepancy .",
    "the electroweak sm predicts a neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) at @xmath7 .",
    "this sensitivity is beyond current experimental techniques , hence any experimental sign of an nedm will also be a sign of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "our collaboration pursues this quest in two overlapping phases :    * in a first step we will measure with an upgraded version of the original ral / sussex / ill spectrometer .",
    "this apparatus is using ucn in vacuum at room temperature and delivered the last and most stringent limit so far on the nedm of @xmath8 , c.l .",
    "this result was statistically limited by the available ucn density at the institut laue langevin  ( ill ) .",
    "the new ucn source at paul scherrer institute  ( psi ) , now ramping up , will provide @xmath9 times higher ucn densities .",
    "together with an improved control on systematic effects using both , localized and large area magnetometers will result in a sensitivity of @xmath10 . * in parallel , an entirely new apparatus ( n2edm ) is being designed .",
    "it will make optimal use of the high ucn density of the psi source , and will have an improved active and passive magnetic shielding .",
    "this will improve the upper limit to @xmath11 , c.l.95% in the case of a null result .",
    "the electric dipole moment @xmath12 of the neutron is measured by comparing the neutron precession frequency @xmath13 in parallel ( @xmath14 ) and anti parallel ( @xmath15 ) electric @xmath16 and magnetic field @xmath17 configurations :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the magnetic moment of the neutron .",
    "taking the difference of both measurements allows us to deduce the electric dipole moment :    @xmath20    the statistical sensitivity for measuring @xmath12 is then given by :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the number of neutrons , @xmath16 the strength of the electric field , and @xmath23 the neutron polarization at the end of the cycle .",
    "the polarization depends on @xmath24 , the product of initial polarization and analyzing power , and the transversal depolarization rate @xmath25 .",
    "increasing the ucn density by a factor 25 with the new ucn source and slightly improving @xmath24 , @xmath26 , and @xmath16 gives the goal sensitivity of @xmath27 in 400 nights .",
    "however , the sensitivity of the measurement is dominated by the second term of eq.[eq : neutronedm ] , the stability of the magnetic field in both configurations . obviously , a very sensitive measurement of the magnetic field in the neutron precession region would allow to correct for the second term .",
    "such a cohabiting large area magnetometer was first implemented in  1997 by the ral / sussex / ill collaboration in the current experimental apparatus@xcite .",
    "it uses polarized @xmath28 atoms precessing within the neutron precession chamber , for a description in more detail see ref.@xcite .",
    "however , severe systematic effects arising from magnetic field gradients within the precession chamber can not be compensated for by a co - magnetometer . due to their small kinetic energy ,",
    "the centers of mass of ucn and of mercury atoms is separated by @xmath29 . in a perfectly homogeneous magnetic field",
    "this would still make no difference , however in vertical magnetic field gradient the mercury atoms and the ucn will sense and average differently the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , an array of 12  cs optically pumped magnetometers  ( cs - opm ) have been adapted to the special needs of the experimental apparatus , including vacuum and high - voltage compatibility@xcite .",
    "it will give us an extra handle on systematic effects correlated to vertical magnetic field gradients .",
    "figure[fig : spectrometer ] is a sketch of the ral / sussex / ill apparatus installed at the new ucn source at psi .",
    "neutrons come in from the left and are polarized to @xmath30% by a @xmath31 t superconducting solenoid .",
    "they are then guided through a ucn switch upwards into the precession chamber .",
    "once an equilibrium ucn density has built up the ucn shutter on the bottom electrode is closed . now",
    "a shutter is opened for @xmath32s such that polarized @xmath28 atoms can also fill the chamber .",
    "neutrons and @xmath28 atoms are polarized parallel or anti parallel to the main vertical magnetic field @xmath33 .",
    "first , the @xmath28 atoms are spin flipped into the plain perpendicular to @xmath34 , by applying a @xmath35hz @xmath36-pulse , then the neutrons ( @xmath37hz ) .",
    "now both spin-@xmath0 species precess with their larmor frequency within the precession chamber . after a time",
    "@xmath26 a second 30hz pulse , in - phase with the first , is applied before the ucn shutter is opened .",
    "meanwhile the switch has changed to a position connecting directly the precession chamber with the ucn detector .",
    "an iron foil in front of the detector together with an adiabatic spin flipping rf  coil located further up stream allows to measure both spin states sequentially at the end of a cycle .",
    "such a sequence of two neutron @xmath36-pulses with the free precession time @xmath26 in between is known as ramsey s method of separated oscillating fields and correlate the polarization measured with the free precession frequency and the frequency of the applied fields .",
    "a circularly polarized light beam from a @xmath38hg  discharge lamp ( @xmath39 nm ) is used to polarize a vapor of @xmath28 atoms by optical pumping in a cell adjacent to the main precession chamber .",
    "the @xmath28 atoms dissociate from a solid hgo source heated to @xmath40 , and continuously fill the cell for the next ramsey cycle .    a second circularly",
    "polarized light beam traverses the precession chamber and is used to read out the precessing frequency of the @xmath28 atoms .",
    "its intensity is measured by a solar - blind photo multiplier  ( pm ) .",
    "after application of the @xmath36-pulse the precessing @xmath28 atoms modulate the light intensity at the larmor frequency of the precessing atoms proportional to the average magnetic field inside the chamber .",
    "twelve cs - opm , four high voltage compatible ones on the charged electrode the others beneath the ground electrode , measure the magnetic field throughout the cycle .",
    "although the intrinsic sensitivity of the magnetometers is of the order of @xmath41 , technical noise and the magnetic environment presently limit the sensitivity to @xmath42 .",
    "decreasing the statistical uncertainty by a factor five also requires to decrease uncertainties from systematic effects accordingly .",
    "this can be achieved by realistic technical modifications and upgrades@xcite . in the last two years we were trying to asses",
    "most of these systematic errors by measurements without neutrons . in the remainder of these proceedings",
    "we will focus in more detail on the uncompensated field drift and give just a brief status of systematic effects directly correlated with changing the polarity of the upper electrode :    _ leakage currents _ which might flow from the charged top electrode to the ground electrode are monitored with a custom made a / v amplifier , protected by an in - house designed protection circuit .",
    "this device allows us to measure and monitor leakage currents with a resolution of some @xmath43 .",
    "it was used during an intensive test campaign with voltages of up to @xmath44kv and shows that typical leakage currents are below 100pa , resulting in a sensitivity of @xmath45    _ hg direct light shift _ is a shift of the measured @xmath28 precession frequency proportional to the intensity of the uv light beam traversing the precession chamber .",
    "the sign of the shift depends on the relative direction of the electric and magnetic field and therefore mimics the signal of a nedm . using data from spring 2011 we could not observe such a dependency and hence estimate a sensitivity of @xmath46 .",
    "_ hg light shift _",
    ", a second type of mercury frequency shift , can be observed , when the read - out light is not exactly perpendicular to the applied @xmath34 field .",
    "a new beam optics now focus the beam onto the pm . from mechanical measurements",
    "one can estimate that the light beam axis diverges at an angle less than 8mrad from a plain parallel to the electrodes , resulting in the projected sensitivity of @xmath47 .",
    "` uncompensated field drift ' refers to systematic effects which arise from higher order magnetic fields the mercury co - magnetometer can not completely compensate for .",
    "these drifts can arise from charging currents magnetizing parts of the apparatus while changing the polarity of the high voltage .",
    "this creates a change in the local magnetization and hence a change of the vertical magnetic field gradient @xmath48 dependent on the polarity of the high voltage .",
    "this effect yields a false nedm signal of :    @xmath49    in autumn 2010 , we searched directly for a change in the vertical gradient of the magnetic field with four cs - opm . always a pair separated by @xmath50 cm in height , one on the top electrode , the other below the bottom electrode , was taken as gradiometer ( cs1-cs2 , cs3-cs4 ) .",
    "the magnetic background field was set to @xmath51 .",
    "the polarity of the electric field ( @xmath52kv ) was changed every 350s with the system s maximum ramping speed of 1kv / s . in fig.[fig",
    ": uncompensated_field_data ] data sets for a false @xmath53 for both cs - opm pairs , taken during @xmath54h , are shown .",
    "a linear correlation analysis shows that both data sets can be combined .",
    "this first test gives a preliminary value of @xmath55 .",
    "our goal is to improve this value by a factor @xmath56 which seems possible in one week of measurements by optimizing the measurement sequence to @xmath57s ( instead of @xmath58s ) , increasing the maximum voltage to @xmath59kv , and using four independent pairs of cs - opm . at the same time we will use an active compensation system around our apparatus to better compensate external magnetic field changes",
    "while the new psi ucn source is ramping up our collaboration is prepared to take first nedm data in autumn 2011 . during the winter shutdown of the accelerator we plan to continue our study of crucial systematic effects . by the end of 2013",
    "we expect to have reached our required sensitivity through 400 nights of good quality data .",
    "this then would result in the case of a null result in a new upper limit of @xmath60(95 c.l . ) . in parallel",
    "we are constructing the next generation apparatus .",
    "we are grateful for the technical support throughout the collaboration and the psi workshops .",
    "we would like to thank the groups from technical university munich and dfg cluster of excellence `` origin and structure of the universe '' for their support and many discussions .",
