    "systems of piecewise - smooth differential equations are used to model diverse phenomena involving switch - like and impact dynamics throughout engineering , biology , and physics ; see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "they consist of ordinary differential equations that are smooth except at certain _ switching surfaces _ , where the presence of a discontinuity permits a variety of intricate dynamical behaviour and bifurcations that are not possible in smooth systems .",
    "the study of how dynamical systems theory can incorporate discontinuities has been the subject of much recent research ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . the extent to which any piecewise - smooth system can be considered as",
    "an approximation to a smooth system , or vice versa , remains an open question .",
    "here we show that smoothing a discontinuity can result in unexpected dynamics , which can be further understood by considering the response of the system to noise .",
    "the problem of how to model switch - like behaviour in dynamical systems is one of considerable complexity . as well as certain unobvious difficulties in relating smooth and piecewise - smooth approximations ,",
    "physical applications show that switches are particularly prone to effects of hysteresis , time - delay , and noise . in the seemingly elementary mechanics problem of dry - friction between rigid bodies ,",
    "there remain numerous viewpoints as to the optimum way to improve upon coulomb s simple discontinuous contact laws , see for example @xcite .",
    "akay considered vibrations due to friction and their effect on friction dynamics @xcite .",
    "the effects of surface roughness and stochastic motions on the friction force have been studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "the problem has also been studied theoretically , with de gennes proposing the study of dry - friction on surfaces subjected to external white noise vibrations @xcite , and this has been extended via a path integral approach to account for basic stick - slip motion @xcite .",
    "the likely sources of noise in electronics , and ways to minimise its effects through regularisation , are of particular interest in the control literature @xcite . while many piecewise - smooth approaches to switching dynamics follow filippov s approach @xcite , attempts to relate their properties to smooth models @xcite raise the question of how general the approach is , and while alternative views have certainly been expressed @xcite , a definitive answer to how closely smooth and piecewise - smooth systems approximate each other remains lacking . here",
    "we show how dynamics outside the filippov convention for piecewise - smooth systems can arise , and how it can be understood in the presence of perturbations due to noise .    in short , the standard ` filippov ' approach involves restricting the form of a set of differential equations _ at _",
    "a discontinuity , to being a linear interpolation of its two forms immediately _ either side _ of the discontinuity .",
    "as filippov showed @xcite , the equations then have solutions that are sufficiently unique to represent a deterministic dynamical system ( with the exception of certain singularities @xcite ) .",
    "the physical significance of the filippov convention has been proven repeatedly in application to electronic control , stick - slip and other mechanical behaviours , and various biological models ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite it was shown that spurious dynamics , which lies outside the scope of the filippov approach , can not only be introduced analytically into a deterministic model , but persists when a system is smoothed out or subjected to random perturbations .",
    "the aim here is to study the effect of random perturbations more closely and more rigorously , by focussing on the effect of white noise .",
    "we study what happens to dynamics near a discontinuity when the governing equations are smoothed out and when noise is added .",
    "these two perturbations are motivated by various practical and theoretical considerations . in control applications ,",
    "the _ regularisation _ of a discontinuous switch by smoothing is utilised to avoid wear and instability @xcite . in mechanics",
    "it is often unclear whether a smooth or discontinuous model is more appropriate @xcite .",
    "mathematically , though one can smooth out a discontinuity and show topological equivalence to classes of slow - fast systems @xcite , this does not take into account spurious dynamics beyond the filippov model . on the problem of noise",
    ", it has recently been shown that stochastic solutions can reduce to the deterministic filippov solution in the zero noise limit @xcite , again assuming a priori the absence of effects that defy the filippov convention .",
    "the present paper shows that spurious dynamics predicted in @xcite can be understood through stochastic dynamics . in the presence of noise , smoothing out the discontinuity can create local potential wells where the solutions may dwell for extremely long times , even in regions where ( [ eq : genfilippov ] ) predicts an immediate escape .",
    "we show that the robustness of such spurious dynamics depends on the relative length - scales of the perturbations due to noise and due to smoothing .",

    "[ sec : scale ] we obtain a local approximation , from which one - dimensional fokker - planck equations are derived in  [ sec : stoch ] .",
    "the implied escape times and probability density functions used to describe sliding and crossing dynamics , respectively , are studied asymptotically in  [ sec : calc ] , with some details of calculations included in an appendix . in  [ sec : friction ] we apply these results to a dry - friction oscillator , showing that spurious sliding dynamics can be used to model disparity of the static and kinetic friction coefficients , quantifying its robustness to noise . closing remarks , including suggestions for further work ,",

    "to investigate the dynamics of a piecewise - smooth system whose switching surface is a manifold in @xmath0 , we first note that with a suitable choice of coordinates @xmath1 , the switching surface is a coordinate plane , say @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is a component of the vector @xmath4 ) . the system may then be written as @xmath5 and we assume @xmath6 and @xmath7 are smooth functions . in the remainder of this section we summarise the approach for solving ( [ eq : genfilippov ] ) , and state our main results concerning the effect of perturbations . as described by filippov @xcite , there are two important , fundamental scenarios for the dynamics near the switching surface : _ sliding _ and _ crossing _ , illustrated in fig .",

    "these two behaviours form a foundation for the study of piecewise - smooth dynamical systems .",
    "other scenarios , such as a repelling form of sliding ( see @xcite ) , or tangencies between the vector field and the switching surface ( see @xcite ) , are not considered here .",
    "of the two scenarios in fig .",

    "[ fig : flows ] are sufficient to initiate a study of spurious dynamics and its robustness to noise .",

    "[ fig : flows](ii.b ) , solutions to ( [ eq : genperturbed ] ) are trapped near @xmath27 for a long period of time , whereas filippov s convention suggests that solutions cross the region @xmath17 in a small time of order @xmath26 .",
    "this extra time implies that a crossing region may exhibit unexpected dynamics .",

    "indeed , in many applications additional modelling assumptions may have the effect of smoothing a switching surface out over a range of phase space that is small relative to uncertainties and randomness .",

    ", the fraction of time spent within a distance @xmath26 of the switching surface is near @xmath260 ( [ eq : psmall ] ) .",
    "consequently , forward evolution is primarily determined by @xmath16 . in the case of crossing , if the smoothing creates a potential well near the switching surface , then dynamics may become stuck in the well with high probability ( [ eq : tsmall ] ) .",
    "overall , in this scenario the behaviour of @xmath16 is important to the dynamics .",
    "we expect that the effect of smoothing and noise on forward evolution from a repelling sliding region ( see @xcite ) will be analogous to that for crossing , except that solutions may escape a neighbourhood of the switching surface on both sides .",

    "we showed that forming a continuous friction model with a cubic characteristic leads to very different dynamics . via the stochastic analysis the cubic function was shown to give rise to a potential well , where the system could linger at the discontinuity and thus exhibit spurious sticking in regions where coulomb s ( and filippov s ) model would predict immediate passage through the switching surface .",
    "such spurious dynamics fits qualitatively with the experimental observation that static and kinetic friction coefficients are often unequal @xcite .",
