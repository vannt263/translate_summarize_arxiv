    "since the discovery of the kerr metric @xcite there have been many attempts to find a physically meaningful matter distribution that could serve as its source ( see @xcite and references therein ) . however , no satisfactory solution has yet been found to this problem .    it is the purpose of this work , to provide an interior solution to einstein equations , satisfying all the usual physical conditions , and smoothly matched on the boundary surface of the fluid distribution , to the kerr metric . with this aim",
    "we shall generalize a procedure , recently proposed to find sources of the weyl metrics @xcite , to the stationary case .    as a particular example we shall find a source for the kerr metric which consists in an anisotropic fluid , satisfying the darmois matching conditions on the boundary surface of the matter distribution , thereby excluding the presence of thin shells , and exhibiting a well behaviour of all physical variables , for a wide range of values of the parameters of the solution .",
    "these include values which are commonly assumed in realistic models of rotating neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "the line element for a vacuum stationary and axially symmetric space  time , in weyl canonical coordinates may be written as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are functions of their arguments .    for vacuum space ",
    "times , einstein s field equations imply for the metric functions @xmath4 @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7    notice that ( [ meq1]),([meq2 ] ) are precisely the integrability condition of ( [ meq3 ] ) , that is : given any @xmath8 and @xmath9 satisfying ( [ meq1]),([meq2 ] ) , a function @xmath10 satisfying ( [ meq3 ] ) always exists .",
    "we can write the line element above , in erez - rosen @xcite , or standard schwarzschild  type coordinates @xmath11 or in spheroidal prolate coordinates @xmath12 @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant which will be identified later .    in terms of the above coordinates the line element ( [ 1 ] ) may be writen as :    @xmath15}dr^2 +   e^{-2\\left[\\psi-\\psi^s\\right]+   2\\left[\\gamma(r , y)-\\gamma^s\\right]}r^2 d\\theta^2 + e^{-2\\left[\\psi-\\psi^s\\right ] } r^2\\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2 , \\label{exterior}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the metric functions corresponding to the schwarzschild solution , namely , @xmath18 , \\label{schwfun}\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath14 is easily identified as the schwarzschild mass .",
    "we shall now assume for the interior axially symmetric line element : @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are functions that , on the boundary surface , equal the metric functions corresponding to the schwarzschild solution ( [ schwfun ] ) , i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "also , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an arbitrary constant and the boundary surface of the source is defined by @xmath29    the case @xmath30 , @xmath31 , corresponds to a spherically symmetric distribution , more specifically , to the well known incompressible ( homogeneous energy density ) perfect fluid sphere , and hence the matching of ( [ interior ] ) with the schwarzschild solution implies @xmath32 .",
    "the simple condition @xmath30 recovers , of course , the static case .    it should be noticed that for simplicity we consider here only matching surfaces of the form @xmath33 , of course more general surfaces with axial symmetry could however be considered as well .",
    "we shall now turn to the matching ( darmois ) conditions @xcite .",
    "thus the continuity of the first and the second fundamental form across the boundary surface implies the continuity of the metric functions and the continuity of the first derivatives @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , producing : @xmath37 where prime denotes partial derivative with respect to @xmath38 and subscript @xmath39 indicates that the quantity is evaluated on the boundary surface .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that we are using global coordinates @xmath40 on both sides of the boundary .",
    "thus , our line element ( [ interior ] ) matches smoothly with any stationary exterior ( [ exterior ] ) , provided conditions ( [ matchingcond ] ) are satisfied .    in the particular case when we want to match our interior with the schwarzschild exterior ( the static limit ) ,",
    "then @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and the source is a perfect fluid if @xmath43 .",
    "we shall now see how the field equations constrain further our possible interiors .",
    "let us first analyse the well known case when the interior is spherically symmetric , then @xmath44 , and the physical variables are obtained from the field equations for a perfect fluid , the result is well known and reads ( in relativistic units ) @xmath45 with @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the energy density and the isotropic pressure respectively , and for the mass function @xmath49 we have @xmath50 implying @xmath51    this model , which describes the well known incompressible perfect fluid sphere , is further restricted by the requirement that the pressure be regular and positive everywhere within the fluid distribution , which implies @xmath52 .",
    "as it is evident from ( [ eeesf ] ) the pressure vanishes at the boundary surface .",
    "finally , if we impose the strong energy condition @xmath53 , we should further restrict our model with the condition @xmath54 .",
    "we shall now proceed to consider the general , non  spherical case .",

    "it is always possible to choose the metric functions @xmath71 and @xmath72 such that , once the junction conditions ( [ matchingcond ] ) are satisfied , the angular derivatives of such functions are continuous , i.e. : @xmath74 and @xmath75 , as well as @xmath76 .",

    "this last condition @xmath91 , which follows from the darmois conditions , and therefore is necessary , in order to avoid the presence of shells on the boundary surface , can be obtained at once from a simple inspection of the equation ( 22 ) in @xcite .",
    "we shall provide a general procedure to choose @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath60 producing physically meaningful models . with this aim , besides the fulfillment of the junction conditions ( [ matchingcond ] ) , we shall require that all physical variables be regular within the fluid distribution and the energy density to be positive .    to ensure the fulfillment of the junction conditions ( [ matchingcond ] ) , we may write without loss of generality , @xmath92 where @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are so far two arbitrary functions of their arguments .    on the other hand , to guarantee a good behaviour of the physical variables at the center of the distribution we shall demand : @xmath96 @xmath97 where ( [ pxy ] , [ eegeneraldet ] ) have been used , and",
    "the subscript @xmath98 indicates that the quantity is evaluated at the center of the distribution .    using the conditions above in ( [ ayg ] )",

    ". then we can finally write for @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( please notice a that there is a misprint in eq.(43 ) in @xcite , there it should read @xmath10 instead of @xmath8 in the two terms within the round brackets for the metric function @xmath106 ) ) @xmath107    @xmath108    @xmath109    the metric functions obtained so far , satisfy the junction conditions ( [ matchingcond ] ) and produce physical variables which are regular within the fluid distribution .",
    "furthermore the vanishing of @xmath72 on the axis of symmetry , as required by the regularity conditions , necessary to ensure elementary flatness in the vicinity of the axis of symmetry , and in particular at the center ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , is assured by the fact that @xmath110 and @xmath111 vanish on the axis of symmetry .",
    "furthermore , the good behaviour of the function @xmath60 on the symmetry axis is fulfilled since @xmath112 and @xmath113 vanish when @xmath114 . finally , let us note that the energy - momentum tensor components ( [ eegeneral ] ) , ( [ pxy ] ) do not diverge on the symmetry axis because the first derivative with respect to the angular variable @xmath82 of both @xmath115 and @xmath116 vanishes on the symmetry axis since not only @xmath112 and @xmath113 vanish there , but their first derivatives with respect to @xmath82 vanish as well .",
    "so far we have presented the general procedure to build up sources for any stationary metric , in what follows , we shall illustrate the method with the example of kerr metric .",
    "the kerr metric in weyl coordinates is given by the following metric functions @xmath117",
    "@xmath118 @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the dimensionless parameter representing the angular momentum of the source , and is related to the rotation parameter @xmath121 of kerr in its well - known boyer - lindquist representation . also , @xmath122 , which in the erez - rosen coordinates becomes @xmath123 ^ 2-m^2 j^2(1-y^2).\\ ] ]    as is well known , the relativistic multipole moments ( rmm ) @xcite , of the kerr solution , are easily given in terms of the rotation parameter @xmath124 ( as well as @xmath121 ) .",
    "in fact , using the fhp method @xcite in order to calculate the rmm , these are expressed in terms of the expansion coefficients ( @xmath125 ) of the ernst potential on the axis of symmetry , but the kerr solution is the only one verifying that each rmm ( @xmath126 ) at any order @xmath127 is just equal to the corresponding coefficient @xmath125 for such order , which implies , @xmath128 therefore , the massive rmm ( even orders ) and the rotational rmm ( odd orders ) can be expressed as follows @xmath129    in particular let us remind that a first conclusion derived from these rmm ( [ rmmkerr ] ) , is that the rotation of the object leads to a negative quadrupole massive moment , @xmath130 , i.e. all the possible sources of kerr solution are oblate .",
    "let us next , consider the line element ( [ interior ] ) with metric functions given by ( [ aygdefa ] ) and ( [ aygdef ] ) @xmath131 with @xmath132 $ ]",
    ".    for the kerr solution we may write :    @xmath133 } , \\label{prepsimq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath134 @xmath135    a straightforward calculation , using ( [ tdens])([t12 ] ) allows us to find the explicit expressions for the physical variables , these are displayed in figures ( 3)(7 ) .",
    "however , before entering into a detailed discussion of these figures , we shall carry out some calculations with the purpose of providing some information about the `` shape '' of the source .",
    "in particular we shall see how it is related with the rotation parameter @xmath124 of the source .",
    "for doing so , using our interior metric , we shall calculate the proper length @xmath136 of the object along the axis @xmath137 , and the proper equatorial radius @xmath138 : @xmath139 where @xmath140 are the cylindrical coordinates associated to the erez - rosen coordinates .",
    "obviously in the spherical case ( @xmath43 ) , both lengths are identical : @xmath141 where the fact that @xmath142 has been taken into account and where @xmath143 , @xmath144 denote the lengths corresponding to the spherical case .",
    "it would be convenient to introduce here the concept of ellipticity ( @xmath145 ) , which in terms of @xmath136 and @xmath138 , is defined as @xmath146 .",
    "the two extreme values of this parameter are @xmath147 , which corresponds to a spherical object , and @xmath148 for the limiting case when the source is represented by a disk . in between of these two extremes we have @xmath149 for a prolate source and @xmath150 for an oblate one .    in the general",
    "( non  spherical case ) we must compare function @xmath151 with @xmath152 , since @xmath153 vanishes along the axis .",
    "it can be seen that the sign of both functions is positive , and their relative magnitudes verify the inequality @xmath154 for all values of @xmath155 in the range @xmath156 $ ] , no matter the sign of the parameter @xmath124 , leading to the well known result that the rotation of the object always generates an oblate source ( @xmath157 ) since @xmath158 . in the figure 1 ,",
    "one example is shown .     _ functions @xmath159 and @xmath160 for values of the rotation parameter @xmath161 and @xmath162 . _ ]    figure 2 shows the ellipticity @xmath145 of the source as a function of the rotation parameter @xmath124 , for different values of the parameter @xmath163 . as can be seen , the relation between @xmath145 and @xmath124 for any value of @xmath163 shows that the greater is @xmath124 , the greater is @xmath145 , and therefore the shape of the source is more oblate .",
    "of course , for @xmath164 ( static case ) we recover the sphericity ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "it is also observed from the figure 2 that the deformation of the source with respect to the spherical case , for any fixed value of @xmath124 , is smaller for larger values of @xmath163 ( less compact object ) .",

    "figure 3 exhibits the behaviour of the radial pressure @xmath165 for different values of @xmath124 .    in it",
    ", we observe the variation of the radial pressure with respect to the spherically symmetric case ( @xmath164 ) .",
    "this variation is smaller for angle values close to the equator , as it is apparent for @xmath166 .",
    "notice that the radial pressure is positive , with negative pressure gradient , and vanishes on the boundary surface .",

    "by extending the general procedure developed in @xcite to the stationary case , we have been able to build up a physically meaningful source for the kerr metric , satisfying the matching conditions on the boundary surface of the matter distribution . in spite of the fact that a perfect fluid source for the kerr metric might exist @xcite , our source is necessarily anisotropic in the pressure .",
    "particular attention deserves the presence of a non  vanishing @xmath175 component of the energy  momentum tensor . indeed , defining as usual an energy  momentum flux vector as : @xmath176 ( where @xmath177 denotes the four velocity of the fluid ) , it appears that , in the equatorial plane of our system , energy flows round in circles around the symmetry axis .",
    "this result is a reminiscence of an effect appearing in stationary einstein",
    " maxwell systems . indeed , in all stationary einstein ",
    "maxwell systems , there is a non vanishing component of the poynting vector describing a similar phenomenon @xcite ( of electromagnetic nature , in this latter case ) .",
    "thus , the appearance of such a component , seems to be a distinct physical property of rotating fluids , which has been overlooked in previous studies of these sources .",
    "we have carried out a systematic search for the range of values of @xmath163 and @xmath124 for which our models exhibit acceptable physical properties .",
    "we have focused on the fulfillment of positive energy density ( p.e.d . ) ( @xmath178 ) , strong energy condition ( s.e.c . ) ( @xmath179 ) and positive radial pressure ( p.r.p . )",
    "( @xmath180).the results of this search are shown in table i. it appears evident that physically meaningful sources exist for a wide range of values of the parameters .",
    "on the other hand , the chosen range of values of the parameters , incorporates values considered in the existing literature , to describe realistic models of rotating neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "let us elaborate on this issue with some detail .",
    "the rotation of the source is determined by the parameters @xmath181 of the exterior solution .",
    "indeed , the rotation parameter @xmath182 stands for the dimensionless angular momentum of the rotating source .",
    "so , if we restrict ourselves to a sub - extreme kerr solution ( @xmath183 ) , then @xmath184 .    in @xcite numerical models of rotating neutron stars are constructed for different eoss . for each eos",
    "the star s angular momentum , ranges from @xmath185 to the keplerian limit @xmath186 , and the dependence of the quadrupole moment on the rotation parameter @xmath124 , is established . within the interval @xmath187 to @xmath188 solar masses for the mass @xmath14 , the parameter @xmath124 is in the interval between @xmath189 and @xmath190 .    in @xcite",
    "upper limits on the parameter @xmath124 are found for representative eoss ; uniformly rotating neutron star models with maximum mass for various equations of state are studied , and the parameter @xmath124 does not exceed the value @xmath191 .    in @xcite",
    "realistic equations of state for rapidly rotating neutron stars are explored , including a wider range of values for @xmath124 .",
    "finally , we would like to conclude with the following comment . in some static sources it may occur that @xmath158 does not imply that the source is oblate ( @xmath157 ) ( see @xcite for a discussion on this issue ) .",
    "however , as we have seen , this is not the case of our source .",
    "/ p.r.p .",
    ".fulfillment ( f ) or violation ( v ) of different criteria for good physical behaviour : positive energy density ( p.e.d . ) ( @xmath178 ) , strong energy condition ( s.e.c . ) ( @xmath179 ) and positive radial pressure ( p.r.p . ) ( @xmath180 ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath192 over f means that although the criterion is fulfilled , nevertheless @xmath193 changes its sign in the interval @xmath194 $ ] within the source .",

    "<S> a , recently presented , general procedure to find static and axially symmetric , interior solutions to the einstein equations , is extended to the stationary case , and applied to find an interior solution for the kerr metric . the solution , which is generated by an anisotropic fluid , verifies the energy conditions for a wide range of values of the parameters , and matches smoothly to the kerr solution , thereby representing a globally regular model describing a non spherical and rotating source of gravitational field . in the spherically symmetric limit </S>",
    "<S> , our model converges to the well known incompressible perfect fluid solution.the key stone of our approach is based on an ansatz allowing to define the interior metric in terms of the exterior metric functions evaluated at the boundary source . </S>",
    "<S> the physical variables of the energy - momentum tensor are calculated explicitly , as well as the geometry of the source in terms of the relativistic multipole moments . </S>"
