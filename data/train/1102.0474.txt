    "photonic crystals have been an exciting field of research since eli yablonovitch and sajeev john published their papers in 1987 @xcite .",
    "photonic crystals are periodic structures designed to affect the propagation of electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "the usual way of constructing such optical components is to carry out numerical simulations of electromagnetic waves hitting and being scattered off a trial design .",
    "the design is then changed by optimization or intuition until the structure has the desired properties . in this paper",
    "we use a layer - stripping procedure to show that it is possible to reconstruct a photonic structure from a set of reflectance data based on harmonic waves . in other words",
    ", we will look at how the inverse problem can be solved .",
    "the ultimate goal is to be able to reconstruct the structures from the observations and use this as a supplementary tool for the design of structures with desired features .",
    "the idea of layer - stripping is to reconstruct the properties of a medium from scattered data originating from an emitted wave pulse on the boundary of the domain .",
    "layer - stripping is based on causality , where the earliest scattered wave from each depth layer is used to recover the structure layer - by - layer .",
    "the method was first used in solving inverse acoustic scattering problems for seismic data ; overviews can be found in @xcite .",
    "later , the method has also been applied to the design and characterization of one - dimensional photonic crystal structures such as fiber bragg gratings @xcite and multimode structures @xcite .    in the present simulation study",
    ", we are considering a two - dimensional structure , layered normal to the @xmath0-direction , with periodically varying refractive index in the @xmath1-direction while being constant in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "the structure is probed by plane polarized harmonic electromagnetic waves traveling in the @xmath0-direction , with the electric field vector pointing in the @xmath2-direction , thus representing a two - dimensional wave propagation problem .",
    "the forward problem , consisting of obtaining reflectance data for a known structure , may be formulated in terms of transfer matrices , providing reflection and transmission matrices for each layer as well as the whole structure .",
    "the corresponding inverse problem , consisting of recovering the properties of the unknown structure from the reflectance data , requires data for several wave numbers and a range of frequencies .    the key step of the synthetic layer - stripping algorithm is to combine reflectance data for different frequencies so as to synthesize data from a short pulse at the time the pulse hits the surface .",
    "the data may then be applied to reconstruct the refractive index profile in the leftmost layer by identifying the local , time - domain fresnel reflection at each point .",
    "once the first layer is known , its transfer matrix may be computed , and the impact of the layer on the reflectance data eliminated . the same idea",
    "is then applied to the modified reflectance data , and continuing in the same way we are , at least in principle , able to reconstruct the whole structure .",
    "we are considering photonic crystals consisting of homogeneous , dielectric and nonmagnetic ( @xmath3 ) materials , where the dielectric permittivity , @xmath4 , is varying in the @xmath1- and @xmath0-directions , and being constant in the @xmath2-direction .",
    "the structure consists of layers orthogonal to the @xmath0-axis , with @xmath5 constant with respect to @xmath0 ( and @xmath2 ) in each layer .",

    "furthermore , we restrict our calculation to a small time interval so that the reflected and transmitted waves are only affected by the first layer .    at the left side of the boundary , the electric field will be a sum of the incoming and the reflected wave , and at the right side , the field consists of the transmitted wave .",

    "the length of the synthesized pulse will depend on the frequency interval @xmath120 $ ] , and be of order @xmath121 .",
    "one must require that the pulse length is shorter than the round - trip travel time in the first layer , i.e. @xmath122 thus , to be able to reconstruct the structure , we need to make sure that the frequency band is wide enough . through simulations",
    "we have seen that for smaller frequency bands , the error fluctuates as the bandwidth grows",
    ". however , as soon as the frequency span is wide enough , the calculations are stable .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec_alg ] , we use eq .",
    "( [ rt_eq ] ) to compute reflection matrices . to compute the reflection matrix and solve the inverse problem ,",
    "the number of fourier components , @xmath123 , the computational domain , @xmath29 , and the @xmath95 frequencies in the interval @xmath120 $ ] , must be chosen .",
    "now , the reflection and transmission matrices will have dimension @xmath124 and the propagation matrix @xmath125 dimension @xmath126 .",
    "note that given the resolution in the @xmath1-direction @xmath127 the maximum nyquist wave number is given as @xmath128 since @xmath129 evanescent modes in vacuum occur when @xmath130 .    as we see in eq .",
    "( [ r_0 ] ) , the updated reflection matrix is a product of the backward traveling waves and the inverse of the forward traveling waves . in a homogeneous medium ,",
    "the forward and backward traveling waves have the @xmath0-dependence @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "thus , when we have evanescent modes with @xmath133 for some @xmath134 , we expect a noise amplification factor of the order of @xmath135 when one layer is stripped off . because of this , we restrict our frequency band to avoid a too large @xmath136 .    note that if the variations in the @xmath1-direction are fast , we will need a finer resolution in @xmath1 . to obtain this , we must either make @xmath123 larger , or @xmath29 smaller , which again implies that the maximum wave number , @xmath137 , increases .",
    "the result is that we need higher frequencies to avoid evanescent modes .",
    "thus , it is convenient to restrict the attention to structures that vary slowly with respect to @xmath1 . we will , however , in example 2 see that we are also able to reconstruct a structure with fast variations",
    ".    there are three effects that mainly contribute to the limitations in this method .",
    "the first one is the effect of evanescent modes , which was discussed above .",
    "the second is related to the contrast between the minimum and maximum refractive indices , @xmath138 and @xmath139 . as the contrast grow higher , more of the light",
    "is reflected by the first layers .",
    "this will in turn make the calculations less accurate @xcite .",
    "the last effect is also related to the bandwidth . as discussed in the beginning of this section , we need the pulse length to be smaller than the layer round - trip travel time , thus imposing a lower limit to the bandwidth .",
    "conversely , if the bandwidth is fixed , the layer thicknesses have to be large enough .    as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_alg ] , it is necessary to shape the reflection data using some window function .",
    "numerical experiments applying three different window functions on the interval @xmath75   $ ] are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : ex1 ] .",
    "as expected , the experiments favor smoother windows over the simple rectangular window .",
    "consequently , a hanning window has been applied for the rest of the computations .    in all simulations",
    "we have assumed that we know the layer thickness .",
    "it would , at least in principle , be possible to reconstruct the layer thickness . to do this ,",
    "one need to use a fictitious layer thickness , @xmath140 , which must be small compared to the expected layer thickness .",
    "then this @xmath140 can be used in the computations , to reconstruct each layer piece by piece .",
    "all the calculations where done using matlab on an intel core 2 quad 2.83 ghz computer . for a typical calculation , the runtime was approximately 260 s. about 180 s was used on calculating the forward problem , i.e. the reflection matrices @xmath141 , the calculation of the permittivity is neglectable , and the calculation and removal of the leftmost layer took about 80 s.      in this example we have chosen a structure where the permittivity within the layers is given as @xmath142 and where the two different layers are obtained by alternating between @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the layer thickness has been set to @xmath145 , and the parameters @xmath146 and @xmath147 are chosen so that @xmath148 i.e. @xmath138 is kept constant , while @xmath149 is varied .",
    "for all the experiments presented here , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , giving a resolution in @xmath1 of @xmath152 and a maximum @xmath153 of @xmath154 .",
    "the choice of frequency band depends on whether we want to include evanescent modes in the computations , how large @xmath136 we can tolerate , and the layer thickness .",
    "we first consider the choice of frequency window functions , eq .",
    "( [ rwxt ] ) , by testing three different functions , a simple rectangular window , the hanning window and the tukey ( tapered cosine ) window .",
    "the comparisons were carried out for two different values of @xmath139 , @xmath155 for the first test , and @xmath156 for the second .",
    "the real difference in the choice of window functions can only be seen in the reconstruction of the second layer .",
    "therefore , the results , displayed in fig .",
    "[ f1:1 ] , are only shown for this layer .",
    "the rectangular window give poor results already for the lowest refractive index , whereas the two other choices give a nice reconstruction .",
    "for the higher index , we see that also the tucky window is beginning to give less accurate results , while for the hanning window there is almost no visible difference from the exact curve . for the rest of the numerical examples , we have therefore chosen to use the hanning window .",
    "let us now turn to the effect of including evanescent modes . in these experiments ,",
    "the permittivity was first chosen such that @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and secondly we had @xmath157 and @xmath159 .",
    "the frequency bandwidth was set constant to @xmath160 , but the lower and upper frequencies were changed to include none , or some evanescent modes .",
    "again , the first layer is nicely reconstructed , so we only show results for the second layer in fig .",
    "[ f1:2 ] . including some evanescent modes",
    "improves the results , but if @xmath136 gets too large , there are fluctuations in the reconstruction .",
    "note that as @xmath139 gets higher , a larger @xmath136 is acceptable .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the field now is locally non - evanescent , since a local @xmath161 in the medium would be @xmath162 .",
    "bigger contrasts in the refractive index may be simulated by keeping the lower index constant at @xmath157 , while the upper index is changed .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ f1:3 ] and we see that the first layer is well reconstructed for all choices of @xmath149 , while some fluctuations in the second layer are visible when @xmath163 .    finally , we demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct more than two layers .",
    "[ f1:4 ] shows the error , given as @xmath164 for each layer in a structure consisting of four layers .",
    "the permittivity was chosen between @xmath157 and @xmath165 .",
    "in this example we have chosen the permittivity to be a square function with period @xmath166 in each layer . to get two different layers , and a permittivity between @xmath138 and @xmath139 , we let @xmath167    this example has been chosen to show that we are able to reconstruct a less smooth function . the fact that the permittivity changes fast seems to be in conflict with the discussion in sec .",
    "[ num_ex ] , but as we see from fig .",
    "[ f2:5 ] we actually manage to reconstruct two layers of this structures as well .",
    "the reason it work is that we only use the low frequency components of the square .",
    "the results can be seen in fig .",
    "in this paper we have presented a method for reconstructing 2d photonic structures layer - by - layer . in principle , the reconstruction is exact , and we have shown through numerical examples that we are able to reconstruct different structures consisting of several layers .",
    "there are essentially three , fundamental mechanisms that limit the accuracy in practice : the presence of evanescent modes , accumulated reflection , and limited bandwidth .",
    "the fact that evanescent modes lead to inaccuracies means that either the probing frequencies must be sufficiently high , or the spatial transversal frequencies of the structure must be sufficiently small .",
    "the second limitation is a result of the fact that if the transmission through the structure is too small , little light reaches the back end .",
    "then the back end has little influence on the reflection data , and can not be reconstructed accurately .",
    "finally , the bandwidth must be sufficiently large such that the synthetic , incident pulse is shorter than the round - trip time in all layers .",
    "alternatively , for a fixed , available bandwidth , the structure must vary sufficiently slowly in the longitudinal direction @xmath0 . in the numerical examples , for a center wavelength the normalized frequency interval @xmath168 $ ] corresponds to the wavelength interval .",
    "the layer thicknesses in the example become .",
    "if the available bandwidth is reduced to @xmath169 nm , the layers must be 510 times thicker to achieve the same accuracy .                         and in ( b ) @xmath159 .",
    "other parameters : @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 $ ] , @xmath172 , @xmath173 . note that only parts of the computational domain @xmath29 are shown in the plots ."
