    "in the local universe , massive galaxies are primarily ellipticals with little ongoing star - formation and red colors .",
    "recent surveys have identified plausible progenitors of these galaxies at redshifts @xmath7 , finding that they have small sizes for their mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , by using rest - frame colors to isolate the bluest dead galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it appears that a significant fraction of them have young ages .",
    "these blue galaxies may be similar to the well - known `` e+a '' galaxies found among low mass galaxies at lower redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although @xcite note that the label `` a galaxies '' may be more appropriate at high redshift as they may lack an underlying old component .",
    "these results are quite exciting and suggest that at @xmath8 we are beginning to see the build - up of the massive end of the red sequence . however , this conclusion is based on two main assumptions .",
    "first , the inclusion of these young galaxies in samples of massive galaxies depends on estimates of stellar mass .",
    "such estimates suffer from systematic uncertainties such as the imf and the contribution of thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tpagb ) stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , especially at @xmath9 , the identification of galaxies as young and old , star - forming vs. quiescent is again based on the sed shapes , more specifically on the shape of the balmer/@xmath10 break , which depends sensitively on proper treatment of dust reddening and thus is uncertain . up to now ,",
    "very few direct measurements of the ages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and masses ( e.g. * ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of massive galaxies exist at @xmath11 .    with spectroscopic data",
    ", one can circumvent these uncertainties .",
    "balmer absorption lines , which are prominent in the spectra of a stars and will only be present in a galaxy spectrum for @xmath12 after star formation has ceased , can be used as luminosity - weighted age indicators . as an example , @xcite identified recently quenched @xmath13-strong ( hds ) galaxies at @xmath14 in the gemini deep deep survey .",
    "these measurements are particularly valuable when combined with velocity dispersions , which provide a direct measurement of the depth of the potential well and can be combined with structural parameters to calculate dynamical ( rather than photometric ) masses .    in this study , we present a sample of eight massive galaxies with deep keck",
    "i spectroscopy using the lris instrument ( and five with x - shooter spectra from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* to be submitted ) ) in combination with rest - frame optical imaging from wfc3 and acs on hst .",
    "using this exceptional dataset , we are able to confirm that all of the galaxies in the sample have high velocity dispersions ( and high dynamical masses ) . from this unique sample ,",
    "we conclude that there is a significant population of recently quenched galaxies with very high velocity dispersions at @xmath15 .",
    "for this project , a sample of massive , bright galaxies was selected from the newfirm medium band survey ( nmbs ) and ukidss uds fields .",
    "the nmbs catalogs include photometry in the cosmos and aegis fields in a multitude of deep broadband and medium band optical and near - ir wavebands and includes medium band photometry in the near - ir to sample the balmer/@xmath10 break in galaxies at these redshifts @xcite . the uds field @xcite also provides deep optical and near - ir photometry over a large @xmath16 field . for both survey catalogs",
    ", we use the eazy software @xcite to calculate photometric redshifts and interrest @xcite to calculate rest - frame colors for all galaxies in the fields .",
    "we use fast @xcite to estimate stellar masses , assuming @xcite ( bc03 ) stellar population models and a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "primary targets were selected to have @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we find that the galaxies exhibit a large range in balmer line strengths , with @xmath19 ranging from @xmath20 ) .",
    "the immediate implication is that they have a large range in ages and/or a recent burst contribution .",
    "furthermore , the median balmer line strength is quite high at @xmath21 .",
    "this is a remarkable result given the high dispersions of the galaxies .",
    "[ fig : properties2]a shows the relation between balmer line strength and velocity dispersion for sdss galaxies ( grey ) and our data ( colored ) .",
    "the balmer lines at @xmath0 are dramatically stronger , and show a much larger range , than at @xmath22 .",
    "this is arguably the most direct evidence yet for rapid quenching of massive galaxies at @xmath0 , as the quantities on both axes are directly measured and completely independent from photometric data .",
    "we note that @xcite also showed a strongly increasing fraction of galaxies with strong balmer lines out to @xmath23 , although their sample had lower photometric masses ( @xmath24 ) and lacked velocity dispersion measurements .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : properties2]b we interpret the balmer lines in the context of the stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "the distribution of balmer line strengths is indicated in the bottom panel and can be interpreted in terms of ages using the top panel . the observed range in line",
    "strenghts implies luminosity - weighted ages ranging from several hundred myrs to maximally old stellar populations , with a median of @xmath12 .",
    "an obvious question is whether we could have drawn the same conclusions from photometric data .",
    "[ fig : properties2]c compares the balmer line strengths and rest - frame @xmath4 colors for the galaxies in this sample and to sps models .",
    "the models are bc03 single population tracks for three different metallicities ( grey ) and double - burst models ( green and orange dot - dashed ) in which @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the galaxy s mass is formed in a secondary burst @xmath27 after the original episode of star - formation . although the _ range _ in colors of this sample of galaxies implies a similar range in ages as the balmer lines do , the data do not follow the model predictions .",
    "specifically , the data show no anti - correlation between color and balmer line strength , as would be expected .",
    "some of the bluest galaxies have weak balmer lines , and some of the reddest have strong balmer lines .",
    "a possible explanation is that the colors are affected by dust reddening , and fig .",
    "[ fig : properties2]c illustrates the importance of independent measures of age . to compare the intrinsic distribution of colors / ages ,",
    "one could design  dust - corrected \" colors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , however these depend strongly on sed modeling and well - determined dust estimates .",
    "we also note that the sample of 13 is barely adequate for this particular test ; larger , unbiased samples may show the expected correlation between balmer lines and colors , as strongly suggested by the complete samples of whitaker et al .",
    "we have identified a population of galaxies at @xmath0 with high velocity dispersions and strong balmer absorption lines .",
    "these results confirm that by @xmath15 the population of massive galaxies is much less uniform than it is locally : instead of being red , dead ellipticals , many have experienced recent star - formation within @xmath28 ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a direct implication is that @xmath29 earlier , at @xmath5 , there must exist highly star - forming progenitor galaxies with similarly high velocity dispersions .",
    "such galaxies have yet to be identified , and the fact that some of the youngest galaxies in our sample are also the reddest suggests that these progenitors may have a very high dust content .",
    "the results are also consistent with our study of the velocity dispersion function of quiescent and star forming galaxies @xcite , as we concluded that quenching must occur efficiently for galaxies with high velocity dispersions .",
    "this conclusion was based on the rapid build - up of the vdf of quenched galaxies and the stability of the star - forming vdf since @xmath15 .",
    "the discovery of this population of young , high - dispersion galaxies is strong evidence in favor of this model .",
    "in addition to having different stellar populations at @xmath9 , a flurry of studies in the last decade have uncovered the dramatic size evolution that massive galaxies have undergone in the last 10 billion years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the temporal correlation between the structural evolution and recently quenched stars presents a tempting connection between the events which halt star - formation in massive galaxies and at the same time cause them to be compact relative to their local analogs .",
    "@xcite found there to be no correlation between color of quiescent galaxies and their sizes , however it would be interesting to investigate the size evolution based on a larger , more representative sample of spectroscopic data to estimate galaxy ages .",
    "we note that the selection and observational biases may influence the distribution of galaxies in this sample . in this context",
    "our study is complimentary to @xcite , which is mass complete for galaxies in the nmbs but relies solely on seds to estimate photometric redshifts , stellar masses and rest - frame colors to derive galaxy ages .",
    "however , we note that while qualitatively the results are similar , we find a puzzling lack of ( anti-)correlation between color and balmer line strength : neither the star - forming galaxies nor the bluest quiescent galaxies in our sample necessarily have the strongest balmer lines .    as is often the case , larger samples are needed to explore these issues . with increasingly powerful multiplexed spectroscopic instruments and excellent space - based imaging",
    "we can construct large samples of galaxies at this pivotal epoch and simultaneously study the structural properties and stellar populations of all types of dynamically massive galaxies ."
