    "these stirring timescales are short compared to the timescales for both melt - back and slot - narrowing via inflow , and this helps to explain why the tiger stripes do not suffer end - freezing nor undergo a corrugation instability .",

    "short - lived pipes may correspond to patches of enhanced emission that have been reported in some analyses of _ cassini _ images ( e.g. @xcite ) ; along - slot variations in the unfrosted width of fractures about the water table are more consistent with a more recent analysis @xcite , that does not require pipes .",
    "we have treated the ocean as a constant - pressure bath and ignored feedbacks of flushed water on ocean pressure , which could be significant .",

    "<S> the tiger stripes are the loci of sustained emission because other fractures are too short ( @xmath10 @xmath3 100 km ) for sustained flow . because sloshing homogenizes water temperatures along stripe strike ( si appendix ) , the magnitude of emission should be relatively insensitive to local tiger - stripe orientation , a prediction that distinguishes the slot model from all crack models . </S>",

    "<S> localized emission might still occur , for example near y - junctions . </S>",
    "<S> the pattern of spatial variability in orbit - averaged activity should be steady , in contrast to bursty hypotheses , and vapor flux should covary with ice - grain flux . </S>",

    "<S> our basic model might be used as a starting point for more sophisticated models of enceladus coupling fluid and gas dynamics @xcite , as well as the tectonic evolution and initiation of the tiger stripe terrain ( e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> such coupling may be necessary to understand the initiation of ocean - to - surface conduits on ice moons including enceladus and europa , which remains hard to explain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initiation may be related to ice - shell disruption during a past epoch of high orbital eccentricity : such disruption could have created partially - water - filled conduits with a wide variety of apertures , and evaporative losses caused by tiger stripe activity would ensure that only the most dissipative conduits ( those with @xmath11  </S>",

    "<S> ocean longevity could be affected by heat exchange with self - sustained slots in the ice shell . </S>",
    "<S> testing habitability on enceladus ( or europa ) ultimately requires access to ocean materials , and this is easier if ( as our model predicts ) turbulent dissipation keeps the tiger stripes open for @xmath33kyr .    </S>",
