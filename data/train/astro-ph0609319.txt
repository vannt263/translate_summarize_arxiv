    "in addition to the afterglow analysis already reported by feroci et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we have performed a time resolved spectroscopy of the afterglow by dividing observation e into 5 time intervals . although the 5 spectra can be fitted by a variety of models , the spectral evolution of the afterglow is well represented by an additional blackbody component with fixed emitting area ( @xmath01.5 km , for a source distance of 15 kpc ) and progressively decreasing temperature ( ) , that can be interpreted as due to a portion of the neutron star surface heated during the flare .    excluding the two observations taken after the exceptional explosive events ( b and e )",

    "on the other hand a significantly lower flux level was seen in the following observations .",
    "the flux decrease actually started when the source was still moderately active ( the flux in observation h is at least 1.2 times lower than in all the previous quiescent observations ) and has been interrupted by a slight rise in coincidence with the march 2006 burst reactivation , as shown by recent xmm - newton observations ( mereghetti et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "although the flux of the only pre - giant flare observation is compatible with that of the quiescent post - flare observations taken before 2002 , its spectrum is significantly harder , as indicated by the comparison of the photon indexes plotted in the second panel of figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the spectral change between observation a and the following quiescent observations is well illustrated by the clear trend of the residuals from the simultaneous fit of the spectra of observations a , c and d ( figure [ fig : res ] ) .",
    "the blackbody parameters are compatible in all the available observations , except for that taken during the afterglow of the intermediate flare ( observation e ) .",
    "this indicates that a constant blackbody component with @xmath12@xmath00.4 kev and emitting area with might be a permanent feature of the x - ray spectrum of sgr1900 + 14 .",
    "to study the high energy emission from we used the bepposax pds instrument , which operated in the 15 - 300 kev range .",
    "the pds instrument was more sensitive than integral in this energy band , but it had no imaging capabilities and therefore the possible contamination from nearby sources must be taken into account .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of the pds instrument was 1.3@xmath13 ( fwhm ) and the background subtraction was performed through a rocking system that pointed to two 3.5@xmath13 offset positions every 96 s. in the case of , the background pointings were free of contaminating sources , as confirmed by the identical count rates observed in the two offset positions during each observation .",
    "the field of is instead rather crowded , with three transient sources , the x  ray pulsars 4u  1907 + 97 @xcite and xte  j1906 + 09 @xcite , and the black hole candidate xte  j1908 + 94 @xcite , located at angular distances of 47@xmath4 , 33@xmath4 and 24@xmath4 from the sgr , respectively .",
    "the pulsations of the two pulsars are clearly visible in the pds data below 50 kev when they are active , while xte  j1908 + 94 , if in outburst , is clearly visible in the simultaneous mecs and lecs images and , being very bright , also in the lightcurve collected by the all sky monitor ( asm ) on board the rossixte satellite .",
    "we have found that at least one of these contaminating sources was on in all the bepposax observations except for the first one ( see table [ tab:2 ] ) .",
    "thus , only the 1997 observation ( obs . a ) , during which a significant signal was detected in the background subtracted pds data , can be used to study sgr1900 + 14 without the problem of known contaminating sources .",

    "the background subtracted pds spectrum of observation a can be well fit by a power - law with photon index , significantly flatter than that measured by integral ( , see figure [ fig:2 ] ) in 2003/2004 .",
    "the corresponding 20100 kev flux is 6@xmath510@xmath15 erg @xmath7 s@xmath11 , a factor @xmath04 higher than during the integral observations , which confirms that before the giant flare the hard x  ray tail of was brighter .",
    "the integral spectrum was collected during @xmath02.5 ms of different observations performed between march 2003 and june 2004 , and thus it represents the hard x  ray emission of averaged over that long time period .",
    "therefore , its relation to the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum can be studied only comparing the spectra taken by other instruments in a similar time period , as shown for example in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the pds instrument , instead , being a high sensitivity hard x  ray detector coupled to the mecs and lecs soft x ",
    "ray cameras , gives us the chance to study the broad band spectrum of during a single observation .",
    "fitting the spectrum of observation a , we obtain a good result ( @xmath8=1.17 for 136 degrees of freedom ) simply extrapolating to higher energies the best - fit model found in the soft x  ray range .",
    "in fact , a fit with an absorbed power - law plus blackbody model gives the following parameters : photon index @xmath16 , blackbody temperature @xmath17 , radius @xmath18 km , and absorption @xmath19 @xmath7 .",
    "we have studied the variability of , both in the hard and in the soft x  ray range , finding the following results :    * except for the observations immediately following exceptional flares , the flux level in soft x  rays was stable while the source was moderately active and progressively decreased when it entered a 3 years long quiescent period . * the intermediate flare of 2001 april 18",
    "was followed by an x  ray afterglow that can be successfully interpreted as due to the heating of a significant fraction of the neutron star surface , that then cools down in @xmath01 day .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation of similar events in other magnetar candidates @xcite . *",
    "the soft x ",
    "ray spectrum during the only available pre - flare observation was harder than in the following quiescent observations .",

    "that observed with the pds instrument in 1997 , we find evidence for variations in flux and spectral slope . * the reduction of the x  ray tail in coincidence with the giant flare is supported by the count rates detected in the pds instrument above 50 kev during the different bepposax observations , that indicate how they significantly decreased already in the first post - flare observation . since the hard x ",
