    "over the last several decades an extensive literature has developed describing monte carlo simulations of both localized ( e.g.  heisenberg ) and itinerant ( e.g.  hubbard ) models of quantum magnetism .",
    "an important subset of these studies has considered situations where the exchange constants @xmath4 or electron repulsion @xmath5 can take on multiple values , with the attendant possibility of quantum phase transitions as the ratio of these energy scales is altered .",
    "for example , in the case of the one - fifth depleted square lattice model of cav@xmath6o@xmath7 , the quotient @xmath8 of the exchange constants on the two different vanadium bonds tunes the associated heisenberg hamiltonian from a disordered dimer phase , to nel order , and then back to a disordered plaquette phase@xcite , lending an understanding of spin gapped behavior in this material .",
    "likewise , bilayer heisenberg@xcite and hubbard@xcite models have a singlet to nel transition depending on the ratio of values of the inter- and intra - plane energies .",
    "in addition to describing systems in which long range order can be destroyed , multiple @xmath4 and @xmath5 can also give rise to transitions between different ordered states , such as charge density versus spin density wave patterns .",
    "simulations of models with several interaction energy scales are especially relevant to heterostructures , where the growth of distinct sheets of the same , or different materials , offers the possibility of tuned magnetic properties",
    ".    in this paper we present a quantum monte carlo investigation of a mixed localized - itinerant magnetic model in which we couple a 2d square layer of ising spins to several metallic planes .",
    "our interest is both in how , potentially , the additional fluctuations of the free electrons suppress the ising transition temperature and on how the magnetic layer initiates order amongst the free fermions .",
    "we also explore whether the coupling of the metal to the localized spins can open a gap in the electronic spectrum , driving a metal to insulator transition , and the penetration depth of the magnetic order into the metal .",
    "our work is related to simulations of multilayer hubbard models in which the on - site interaction @xmath9 can distinguish metallic from magnetic layers@xcite .",
    "however , by treating the correlated layers as classical , localized spins we are able to explore a greater range of parameter space , and , in particular , to go to lower temperatures away from half - filling of the metallic band where a sign problem would otherwise prevent simulations .",
    "this idea of coupling classical spins to itinerant electrons has been extensively used , e.g.  in multiband models of the manganites and iron pnictides where the sign problem similarly precludes treating fully quantum mechanical models @xcite .",
    "numerical approaches to these models allow easier access to dynamical behavior and hence greater possibility of contact with spectroscopy and neutron scattering experiments@xcite than do direct path integral treatments of many - electron systems which require a difficult analytic continuation to get real time information .",
    "a number of recent experiments have examined electronic reconstruction at the interface of different transition metal oxides using scanning tunneling microscopy with high spatial and energy resolution .",
    "some of these experiments focus on interfaces of paramagnetic metals and antiferromagnetic insulators @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian we consider here , in which tight binding layers couple to classical , localized spins , is the most simple model of such a situation , and will clearly require considerable refinement before being able to make any sort of quantitative contact .",
    "nevertheless , it can lend a first qualitative insight into the sort of trends one might expect , e.g.  for magnetic order .",
    "moreover , the study of fluctuating classical spins coupled to fermionic degrees of freedom has recently been suggested as a generally promising approach to move beyond mean - field treatments of interacting electron systems @xcite , providing further motivation for this work .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we write down the fermion - ising hamiltonian along with a brief summary of the numerical methods employed , and definitions of the observables which characterize the phases .",
    "section [ sec : results ] describes the results when the fermi level is at the band center , first for the case of antiferromagnetic ( af ) ising spins and then for ferromagnetic coupling , followed by a discussion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : resultsdoped ] ) of the effect of doping away from half - filling .",
    "a particular interesting charge disproportionation is shown to occur where metallic layers become unequally populated to allow for an optimal magnetic response .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] presents a conclusion and some future directions of research .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath10 where @xmath11 are creation(destruction ) operators for fermions of spin @xmath12 on lattice site @xmath13 of layer @xmath14 .",
    "our convention is that layer @xmath15 is adjacent to the classical spins .",
    "the intra - layer hopping @xmath16 is on nearest - neighbor sites ( denoted by @xmath17 ) of each layer @xmath18 ; the inter - layer hopping between neighboring fermionic layers @xmath19 is @xmath20 , and the density of fermions is tuned by the chemical potential @xmath21 .",
    "the geometry of each layer is that of a 2d square lattice of linear length @xmath22 .",
    "the remaining degrees of freedom are ising spins which populate a single layer@xcite and are coupled by exchange constant @xmath0 .",
    "the ising spins interact with the @xmath23 component of the fermion spin @xmath24 in the interface layer @xmath15 , via a second exchange constant , @xmath1 .",
    "the lattice geometry is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "we choose periodic boundary conditions in the planes , and open boundary conditions in the direction perpendicular to the planes .",
    "our results will be for two metallic layers ( i.e.  @xmath25 ) , since , as we shall show , such a situation already allows us to address many of the key questions concerning the interface between a magnetic and a metallic layer .",
    "we have chosen @xmath26 ( both signs of @xmath0 will be studied ) so that the temperature scale for the development of correlations in the classical spins is comparable to that in the metallic layer and , consequently , possible competing phases are most readily discerned .",
    "there are different ways to understand this .",
    "the most simple is to note that , if @xmath27 , the 2d square lattice ising @xmath28 is much higher than typical temperature scales at which short range correlations get more robust for noninteracting fermions in a square lattice .",
    "this is because for the half - filled @xmath29 hubbard hamiltonian , short range antiferromagnetic correlations corresponding to the fermi wavevector is @xmath30 , do not onset until the temperature gets below @xmath31 .",
    "even when electron - electron interactions , which are not considered here , are turned on , nearest neighbor spin correlations do not begin to grow substantially until @xmath32 ( for the @xmath33 hubbard model ) .",
    "thus in either case , a choice @xmath34 ( ising @xmath35 is required to select classical spin and fermionic spin ordering scales to be roughly equal .",
    "an alternate to eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] would be to consider continuous planar @xmath36 or heisenberg @xmath37 spins , with an @xmath38 spin - spin coupling between pairs of local spins , and @xmath39 spin - spin of local spin to fermion spin.@xcite the restriction used here , to a single ( @xmath23 ) component , has been considered in other problems involving treating electronic correlation , from mean field approaches@xcite to the study of the @xmath16-@xmath40 model.@xcite the choice of ising spins also ensures a robust magnetic phase transition in which true long range order occurs at finite @xmath41 in the spin plane .",
    "this will be discussed further in the conclusions .",
    "it is worth noting several symmetries of the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] . consider first a combined particle - hole transformation @xmath42 and inversion of the localized spins @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath44 denotes a staggered @xmath45 phase taking opposite values on the two sublattices of the bipartite square lattice .",
    "this transformation leaves each of the terms in the hamiltonian- the fermion kinetic energy , the ising interaction , and the local spin - fermion coupling invariant .",
    "thus , if @xmath46 , the whole hamiltonian is unchanged , and the lattice is half - filled ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the finite temperature properties of the system can be obtained from its partition function and associated expectation values .",
    "the partition function is ,    @xmath48    where @xmath49 represents the grand - canonical partition function of the fermionic part of the hamiltonian for a particular ising field configuration @xmath50 . since the hamiltonian eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] is bilinear in the fermionic operators , each @xmath51 can be written as the product of a vector of creation operators , a real - valued matrix @xmath52,@xcite and a vector of destruction operators .",
    "the fermion contributions to @xmath53 can then be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath54 of @xmath55 , @xmath56    from this expression , it is clear that the summand in eq .",
    "[ eq : ztotal ] is positive definite and there is no `` sign problem '' ( for any @xmath21 ) . of course",
    ", this is simply a consequence of the fact that the spin field to which the fermions are coupled does not vary in imaginary time , as it would , for example , if @xmath57 were a hubbard - stratonovich field used to decouple a fermion - fermion interaction .",
    "the largest computational effort arises from diagonalizing the two @xmath58x@xmath58 matrices @xmath52 for each update to the configuration of the ising spins @xmath59 .",
    "an alternate method to the direct matrix diagonalization used in the literature employs a representation of the density of states @xmath60 in terms of chebyshev polynomials @xcite .",
    "the moments of @xmath60 are computed recursively in a way that involves only sparse matrix - vector multiplications .",
    "this approach improves the scaling with system size to linear in @xmath58 , at the cost of a significant prefactor .",
    "it also involves a ( well - controlled ) approximation which is the truncation of the expansion at some maximum order .",
    "here we use exact diagonalization , as opposed to the chebyshev method .",
    "the results of the simulations presented below were obtained by averaging over 5 - 10 independent simulations , each of which was composed of 35,000 monte carlo sweeps of the ising variables .",
    "typically , the linear lattice size @xmath22 was varied between @xmath61 , selecting a geometry with one ising plane and stacked on top of two fermionic ones , so that @xmath62 .",
    "expectation values of the ising variables are averaged in the usual way over the configurations generated in the course of the simulation .",
    "for example , to address directly if there is long range ferromagnetic order in the ising plane in the case @xmath3 , we calculate the fourth order binder cumulant  @xcite , @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath64 is the magnetization per site .",
    "when @xmath2 ( the antiferromagnetic case ) we replace @xmath65 by the staggered magnetization , @xmath66 .",
    "crossings of @xmath67 obtained for different lattice sizes determine the critical temperature for magnetic ordering of the classical spins .",
    "when the interaction @xmath1 between the ising and fermionic spins is nonzero , we expect a shift away from the 2d square lattice ising @xmath68 .",
    "fermionic measurements like the kinetic energy , double occupancy , and spin - spin correlations can be written in terms of combinations of the single particle green s functions , @xmath69 , for every configuration of the classical spins .",
    "the elements of @xmath70 are easily obtained from the diagonalization of @xmath55 which is already in hand from the update of the spin variables .",
    "further details of the numerical algorithm for coupled classical spin - fermion systems are contained in refs .",
    "it is known from related simulations of hubbard hamiltonians that fermions with no direct interaction @xmath9 have large finite size effects : the discrete ( and often highly degenerate ) @xmath29 energy levels @xmath71 are readily visible in measurements , especially dynamic quantities like the density of states . although the @xmath29 metal considered here is coupled to classical spins , and hence does have interactions , we still observe significant finite size effects , especially in the metallic portions of the phase diagram .",
    "we overcome this difficulty through the introduction of a small magnetic field @xmath72 along the direction perpendicular to the planes . here",
    "@xmath73 is the magnetic flux quanta . with this choice",
    ", the intralayer hopping terms are changed by a peierls - like phase factor @xmath74 .",
    "we use the landau gauge in order to set the values of the vector potential @xmath75 .",
    "this procedure can be considered as an improvement / generalization of  boundary condition averaging \" @xcite . for a more complete description ,",
    "see ref .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to emphasize the distinction of this field , which couples to the ` orbital ' motion of the electrons ( i.e. their hopping ) from a zeeman field coupling to spin which affects magnetic order .",
    "the orbital field introduced here reduces finite size effects by introducing an additional averaging over discrete allowed momenta on a finite lattice .",
    "the coupling to the classical spins , on the other hand , produces a zeeman field for the electrons , whose role in ordering we will determine .",
    "this reduction in the finite size effects is especially evident in the single particle density of states , @xmath76 here @xmath77 are the components of the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath78 of the matrices @xmath55 defining the ( quadratic ) hamiltonian , and which now contain the phase factors described above .",
    "the outer sum averages all the equivalent sites in order to recover translationally invariance .",
    "instead of displaying well - separated discrete delta - function peaks , even for free fermions",
    "@xmath79 becomes nearly continuous on relatively small lattices , and has a form much closer to that of the thermodynamic limit.@xcite in our hamiltonian , turning on @xmath1 further reduces residual finite size effects .",
    "because of fermi surface nesting with vector @xmath80 , the dominant magnetic instability of the half - filled square lattice hubbard hamiltonian is antiferromagnetic . indeed",
    ", the noninteracting susceptibility @xmath81 diverges as temperature @xmath82 so that , within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , the ground state exhibits af order for any finite @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , in the strong coupling ( heisenberg ) limit , the exchange interaction @xmath0 favors near neighbor spins which are anti - aligned . since the @xmath29 fermion sheets exhibit this strong af preference , we expect a rather different response to the coupling of an af versus a f ising plane to the metal .",
    "we begin with the af case .",
    "figure  [ fig : binder1 ] shows the binder ratio @xmath67 for two metallic planes of linear size @xmath22=4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 coupled in each case to a single ising plane of the same dimensions .",
    "the interlayer hopping between the fermionic layers is set to @xmath83 and the coupling @xmath1 between the local spins and the fermions is @xmath84 .",
    "the binder ratios for the three lattice sizes cross at a common point , @xmath85 , representing a 36% enhancement over the free spin plane result @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "similar binder crossing plots for other choices of @xmath1 and interlayer hopping yield analogous transition temperatures , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_cvsj_h ] .",
    "the enhancement in @xmath41 over that of an independent spin plane is nontrivial , because there is a competition between the additional entropy which results from fluctuations of fermionic variables in the metallic plane and the tendency , noted above , towards antiferromagnetism of the @xmath29 hubbard model , due to fermi surface nesting .",
    "evidently , the latter tendency wins : @xmath88 is enhanced .",
    "the universality class of the transition to an ordered phase as the temperature is lowered remains an open question .",
    "our results are consistent with an ising transition , and we believe that is the most likely scenario , but the available system sizes do not allow us to draw any final conclusion .",
    "there are several additional interesting features in the data .",
    "first , the enhancement in @xmath41 is non - monotonic in @xmath1 .",
    "the transition temperature reaches a maximum at @xmath89 for both @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "although data are not shown , even for @xmath92 the enhancement of @xmath41 comes back down at large @xmath1 .",
    "we note that the band structure of the two sheet hubbard model is @xmath93 .",
    "the two bands overlap for @xmath94 and have a band gap @xmath95 otherwise .",
    "thus the choice @xmath96 represents the coupling of an ising spin layer to a band insulator rather than a metal .",
    "figure  [ fig : t_cvsj_h ] indicates that the magnetic response of the ising layer is qualitatively the same in the two situations ( metal with @xmath97 or band insulator with @xmath98 ) , although the response of a coupling to a band insulator produces less of an effect , as might be expected .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the bilayer fermi surface is still nested with @xmath80 for @xmath99 , even though the density of states at @xmath100 vanishes .    the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath41 with @xmath1 is reflected also in the evolution of the farthest - neighbor intraplane spin correlation function .",
    "[ fig : c_isingvst ] shows @xmath102 vs.  @xmath103 for several values of @xmath1 at @xmath104 on a 8x8 lattice .",
    "this quantity , which in the thermodynamic limit would equal the square of the order parameter , evolves rather sharply from zero to one as @xmath103 is lowered .",
    "the position where the switch in values occurs moves to larger @xmath103 as @xmath1 changes from @xmath105 to @xmath106 , but then comes back down , in agreement with the maximal @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_cvsj_h ] .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : c_isingvst ] displays the same quantity as a function of temperature and shows , unequivocally , this non - monotonic effect .",
    "having described the effect of the interaction @xmath1 between the ising spin plane and the metal on the ordering transition of the classical spins , we turn now to the issue of the effect of @xmath1 on the metal .",
    "we calculate several quantities that characterize both the magnetism and the transport in the fermionic planes .",
    "we begin by showing , in fig .",
    "[ fig : kxyvst ] , the intra - plane kinetic energy@xcite as a function of temperature for the different values of @xmath1 . in ( a ) , which gives the kinetic energy of electrons in the fermionic plane right at the interface , the increase of the interaction with the ising spins localizes the electrons , eventually driving their kinetic energy to small values .",
    "this trend is monotonic in @xmath1 . in ( b ) , the farthest plane from the interface with the ising spins , we find a much weaker effect , as is expected in the absence of direct contact with the classical spin layer .",
    "there is a steady increase of the absolute value of the kinetic energy- the opposite of the effect seen in layer @xmath15 .",
    "the sharp crossover temperature in the fermion kinetic energy aligns with @xmath41 for the classical spins , as given in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_cvsj_h ] .",
    "the double occupancy @xmath107 provides complementary information to the kinetic energy , and in particular provides insight into the formation of local moments @xmath108 and the possibility of mott metal - insulator behavior .",
    "specifically , @xmath109 at half - filling so that vanishing double occupancy implies a well - formed moment on every site , and a non - zero double occupancy implies moments which are partially suppressed by charge fluctuations .",
    "@xmath110 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nudvst ] . data for plane 0 and plane 1 are shown in the top and bottom panels , respectively . in both cases",
    "@xmath111 takes on its uncorrelated value @xmath112 for @xmath105 , as should be the case for a metal with no interactions . in plane 0",
    ", there is a monotonic suppression of double occupancy with @xmath1 , and hence a steady development of local moments . by the time @xmath113 double occupancy",
    "has decreased to @xmath114 implying @xmath115 .",
    "the reason for this behavior is clear : the classical ising spin @xmath59 acts as a local magnetic field for the fermions on site @xmath13 in plane 0 , enhancing(suppressing ) the occupation of the electron spin occupation parallel(antiparallel ) to it .",
    "as we shall see , this induced moment formation aids in magnetic ordering .    in plane 1 ,",
    "more isolated from the classical spins , the double occupancy is barely modified from its @xmath105 value .",
    "nevertheless , despite exhibiting only a small efect , the onset of deviations provides a nice signal of the nel transition temperature .",
    "indeed , the non - monotonicity of @xmath88 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_cvsj_h ] is reflected in a similar non - monotonicity in the double occupancy in fermionic plane 1 .",
    "presumably , the large response of the double occupancy to the effective field in plane 0 , which is evident far above @xmath88 , masks the more subtle signature of the onset of long range order .",
    "long range order of the spin in the metallic planes can be analyzed by a finite size scaling of the antiferromagnetic structure factor,@xcite @xmath116 here @xmath117 represents the magnetic order parameter in the metallic layer , and the sum over @xmath118 is restricted to that same layer .",
    "the coupling of the ising spins with the @xmath23 component of the fermionic spins breaks the @xmath119 symmetry of the hubbard hamiltonian , leading to the possibility of long range order at finite temperature .",
    "figure  [ fig : safvs1_l ] shows the extrapolation according to eq .  [ eq : fss ] .",
    "we chose @xmath83 , and separate the contributions of plane 0 and 1 in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "however , we do not attempt to discern this possibility , and restrict ourselves to examining the ground state magnetism by setting @xmath120 where the structure factor has saturated to its ground state value .",
    "the values of @xmath121 in the two layers , obtained from the thermodynamic limit @xmath122 extrapolation , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_afvsj_h ] for the same three cases for the interplane hopping appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_cvsj_h ] .",
    "again , the plot is separated in ( a ) and ( b ) corresponding to the planes 0 and 1 , respectively .",
    "while plane 0 , which directly interacts with the ising spins , becomes easily  saturated \" ( @xmath123 ) with the increase of @xmath1 , the fermions on plane 1 , farther from the classical spins , are less easily aligned . for smaller values of @xmath1 , the long range - order present in the plane at the interface",
    "is propagated farther inwards . however , for @xmath124 , the magnetism in plane 1 gets less robust . indeed , the reduction of magnetic order in plane 1 coincides with saturation of magnetic order in plane 0 .",
    "we turn now to the issue of how the coupling to the classical ising spins affects the density of states @xmath79 of the metal .",
    "there are two separate issues to consider .",
    "first , even at high temperatures , the fluctuating classical ising spins act as a random site energy @xmath125 for the fermions . in the limit @xmath126",
    ", we expect @xmath127 .",
    "nonzero hopping will broaden this distribution .",
    "second , as @xmath128 is lowered , the ising spins no longer fluctuate randomly but instead , for @xmath2 , form an ordered antiferromagnetic pattern .",
    "this staggered site energy opens a gap in the fermionic spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : dosafv2 ] shows @xmath79 for @xmath129 and @xmath83 .",
    "the left panels give @xmath79 in plane 0 for fixed @xmath130 ( the density of states for individual planes is obtained by the appropriate restriction of the spatial sum in eq .",
    "[ eq : dos ] . ) and decreasing temperature .",
    "both features discussed above are present : peaks in the density of states at @xmath125 at all temperatures , and , near @xmath131 , an insulating gap which opens only below the ising @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : binder1 ] ) for @xmath130 .",
    "the insulating gap is substantially less than one might expect from a strictly rigid staggered site energy .",
    "presumably , this reflects some residual fluctuations of the ising spins .    in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : dosafv2 ] the density of states in the plane further from the interface is shown . in the topmost panel fig .",
    "[ fig : dosafv2](e ) , where @xmath105 , we recover the analytic result of the dos of a bilayer with @xmath83 ( displayed as a black thick curve ) , with some additional structure associated with the discrete finite lattice peaks . for @xmath1 nonzero , the antiferromagnetic gap induced in layer 0 propagates to layer 1 , rendering it insulating as well .",
    "the size of the gap in @xmath79 for layer @xmath133 goes down for large @xmath1 , consistent with the decrease in the af order parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : m_afvsj_h](b ) ) .",
    "one picture of the induced antiferromagnetism , and associated gap , in the layer not adjacent to the ising spins , is the following : when the ising spins order they induce antiferromagnetism in plane 0 via @xmath1 .",
    "it is preferable to have a fermion in plane 1 of opposite spin from the one above it in plane 0 , because it can then hop in the perpendicular direction , a lowering of the kinetic energy which is forbidden by the pauli principle if the plane 1 fermion has parallel spin to the plane 0 fermion .",
    "the antiferromagnetic tendency of tight binding electrons on a square lattice at half - filling can be understood from a weak coupling perspective : the fermi surface is nested at the antiferromagnetic ordering vector @xmath134 and , as a consequence , the non - interacting susceptibility @xmath135 diverges there as @xmath136 .",
    "this reasoning suggests @xmath41 might be suppressed for ferromagnetically coupled ising spins , whose ordering wave - vector conflicts with what the half - filled metallic fermion spins prefer .",
    "figure [ fig : tc_fvsj_h ] shows the transition temperature @xmath41 of ferromagnetically coupled ising spins in contact with a half - filled metallic layer .",
    "it confirms that @xmath41 is suppressed , consistent with the qualitative argument suggested above , and in contrast to the enhancement seen in the antiferromagnetic case of fig .",
    "[ fig : t_cvsj_h ] .",
    "the maximal suppression of @xmath41 occurs at @xmath137 , and reveals a lowering of @xmath41 by almost a factor of two .",
    "@xmath41 ultimately recovers , but only for very large values @xmath138 .",
    "when ferromagnetic order is present in layer 0 , we can ask whether it will induce similar order in the more distant layer 1 , something which occurred with antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath0 .",
    "we calculated the ferromagnetic structure factor ( @xmath139 ) for the same values of interaction @xmath1 considered in the previous case . a similar finite size analysis , eq .",
    "[ eq : fss ] , was performed , the order parameter @xmath140 for _ ferromagnetism _ in each of the fermionic planes was obtained as function of @xmath1 for low temperature , and is shown in fig .  [ fig : m_fvsj_h ] .",
    "ferromagnetic order is induced in both planes , although @xmath141 is an order of magnitude smaller for plane 1 than for plane 0 , in contrast to the antiferromagnetic case where there was only a factor of two difference .",
    "as they order , the fermions in direct contact with the ising spins ( @xmath15 ) start to localize as seen in their reduced double occupancy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kxynudvst_ferro](b ) ) . for any @xmath1 and @xmath128 ,",
    "the double occupancy for @xmath133 is basically unchanged from its uncorrelated value @xmath142 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kxynudvst_ferro](c ) ) .",
    "this is similar to what happend in the af case of fig .",
    "[ fig : nudvst](b ) .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath15 kinetic energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kxynudvst_ferro](a ) ) , on the other hand , is quite different from the af case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : kxyvst ] ) .",
    "althougn in both cases there is a systematic suppression with @xmath1 , in the ferromagnetic case the magnitude of the kinetic decreases as @xmath128 is lowered for @xmath143 .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the pauli principle : in the f case , ordering of the ising spins promotes polarization of the fermions in layer @xmath15 and as this polarization becomes more and more complete the fermions can no longer hop on the lattice .",
    "finally , we analyze the influence of the magnetically ordered plane of ising spins on the metallic density of states , fig .",
    "[ fig : dosfv2 ] . similar to the af case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dosafv2 ] ) , there are peaks at @xmath144 for layer @xmath15 .",
    "the increase of @xmath1 induces a pseudogap , however the insets to ( c ) and ( d ) indicate @xmath145 remains finite , in contrast to the af case .",
    "the dashed line gives the density of states for a single fermionic plane coupled to a perfectly ordered ferromagnetic arrangement for the ising spins , which is derived from the dispersion @xmath146 .",
    "the dos for plane @xmath133 is approximately given by that of a fermionic bilayer with @xmath83 .",
    "the effect of @xmath1 is to slowly decrease the distance between the van hove singularities at @xmath147 .",
    "this trend would then ultimately result in a single van hove singularity at @xmath131 similar to that of an isolated free fermion plane .",
    "increasing @xmath1 helps `` disconnecting '' the planes @xmath148 which are not right at the interface .",
    "similar decoupling can be seen in layered hubbard models@xcite .",
    "in the previous section we analyzed the influence in the critical temperature of the ising plane after attaching a metal to it . its enhancement(suppression ) could be explained by the preferred wave - vector of the ordering in this metallic region .",
    "since there is a natural tendency for short - ranged antiferromagnetic order for free fermions in a tightly - binded bipartite lattice at half - filling , these fermions and the ising spins act cooperatively in order to boost the critical temperature of the antiferromagnetic ising model . the same argument shows that when the ising spins have a ferromagnetic coupling , the critical temperature is reduced , once again due to the antiferromagnetic tendency introduced by the contact with the fermionic spins .",
    "we now examine the doped lattice where the dominant af response in the noninteracting @xmath149 of eq .",
    "[ eq : rpa ] is no longer present .    performing a similar analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig : binder1 ] we computed the crossings in the binder ratios for several values of the interaction @xmath1 when the metal has a fixed total density @xmath150 .",
    "the global chemical potential @xmath21 in eq .",
    "[ eq : hamiltonian ] is tuned in order to select this density for each of the lattice sizes and temperatures values calculated .",
    "figure  [ fig : t_c_dopedvsj_h ] shows the dependence of the critical value of the ising spins for @xmath83 and @xmath151 . when @xmath83 so that two metallic layers are coupled to the ising magnetic layer , the qualitative behavior is similar to that at half - filling ( figs .",
    "[ fig : t_cvsj_h ] and [ fig : tc_fvsj_h ] ) .",
    "indeed , the values of the transition temperatures are quantitatively similar .",
    "this is true in both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cases .",
    "however , when @xmath152 , so that only one metallic plane is coupled , doping appears to change the behavior of @xmath41 quite substantially .",
    "while for small values of @xmath1 the increase(decrease ) of the critical temperature of the antiferromagnetic(ferromagnetic ) ising model is the same as for @xmath153 , once higher values of @xmath1 are reached ( @xmath154 in the af case and @xmath155 in the f one ) the scenario changes .",
    "an antiferromagnetic ising plane has its critical temperature decreased by the coupling with the free electron spins while in the ferromagnetic case the critical temperature is enhanced .",
    "this is not completely unexpected since , as commented earlier , the peak in @xmath149 moves away from @xmath134 so that the fermions in the metal no longer so strongly favor af order .",
    "the reason that this does not happen in the two layer case @xmath156 is that the second metallic layer @xmath133 acts as a charge reservoir for the layer @xmath15 at the interface .",
    "that is , the electron density is imbalanced , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho_vs_j_h_doped ] .",
    "plane @xmath15 adjacent to the magnetic layer has a tendency to become half - filled , leaving the farthest plane less populated . for larger values of @xmath1",
    "the occupations tend to @xmath157 and @xmath158 , for @xmath15 and @xmath133 respectively . throughout this evolution",
    "the total density is preserved at @xmath150 .",
    "the half - filling of layer @xmath15 allows for the enhancement(supressing ) of the critical temperature of an antiferromagnetic(ferromagnetic ) aligned ising plane .",
    "we studied magnetic order at the interface between an insulator and a metal using quantum monte carlo .",
    "specifically , we considered a 2d ising plane coupled to a lattice of noninteracting ( metallic ) fermions . in the case of an antiferromagnetic ising model , and a half - filled metal , the coupling enhanced the ising critical temperature .",
    "antiferromagnetic order was also induced in the metal , both in the layer immediately at the interface with the classical spins and also deeper within .",
    "this enhancement occurs even in the case where the interlayer hopping in the fermionic sheet is made large enough that the fermions become a band insulator , namely a bilayer with interplane hopping @xmath20 bigger that @xmath159 .",
    "in contrast , the critical temperature of ferromagnetic ising spins is reduced by the coupling to the fermions at half - filling .",
    "we attribute these distinct effects to be a consequence of the perfect nesting of the square lattice fermion tight binding hamiltonian , which favors antiferromagnetism .",
    "indeed , studies of the doped lattice demonstrate that the system s desire to optimize ` magnetic consistency ' , that is to have an af metallic response when the magnetic layer is af , is so great that , if available , charge will be pulled from a second magnetic layer into the interface metallic layer so that half - filling is maintained there . in the absence of such a reservoir ,",
    "the af transition is suppressed by this mismatch with the metallic ordering vave vector .",
    "a central consideration of our work has been the consistency of the order in the classical spin plane from the ordering tendency of the metal . in  unfrustrated \" cases where the metal and local spins prefer the same wave - vector , transition temperatures",
    "are enhanced , and _",
    "vice versa_. recent experiments @xcite have explored the importance of these considerations on the decoupling of surface and bulk magnetism in uo@xmath160 .",
    "the distinct surface behavior observed is attributed to the different symmetry of its ordered phase relative to the bulk .",
    "other 3d systems in which 2d order occurs due to frustration are certain of the doped cuprate superconductors @xcite . in individual cuo@xmath160 sheets , stripes of",
    "@xmath161-wave order coexist with intervening antiferromagnetic stripes .",
    "the orientation of the @xmath161-wave phases alternates from stripe to stripe in a given layer . in adjacent cuo@xmath160 sheets ,",
    "the same stripe pattern occurs , but , because of structural effects , the stripes are oriented perpendicular to the neighboring sheet .",
    "the result is that the intersheet josephson coupling tends to cancel and 2d superconductivity is observed .    a natural progression of the work reported here would be to consider the case of continuous xy ( planar ) or heisenberg spins .",
    "as previously noted , in this case an isolated 2d spin plane has no transition to long range order , owing to the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "one interesting question will be how the less robust power law correlations which develop at low @xmath128 in the xy case are qualitatively affected by coupling to the metal .",
    "for @xmath3 , where we find the ising @xmath41 suppressed , will the kosterlitz - thouless transition survive ? because the fermion determinant depends only on the spin degrees of freedom in the interface layer , adding additional spin layers has relatively little computational cost .",
    "thus it is feasible to study a 3d lattice heisenberg spins , which has a finite ordering temperature , coupled to one of more metallic layers .",
