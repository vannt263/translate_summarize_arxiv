    "the utility of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) to the study of cosmology rests upon the ability to calibrate the difference in absolute magnitude between events , allowing for an accurate determination of the distance - redshift relationship .",
    "variations in the intrinsic luminosity of each event can be measured by the width and color of the observed light curve @xcite . after applying these relations using light - curve fitting codes such as salt2  @xcite or mlcs2k2  @xcite",
    ", the resulting derived distance moduli display an intrinsic scatter about the best - fit cosmology equivalent to @xmath5 in distance .",
    "the difference between the measured distance modulus of a sn and the best - fit cosmology is known as the hubble residual ( hr ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of sne ia have additionally been shown to depend on their environment ; sne ia in late - type galaxies are intrinsically more luminous than those in early - type hosts @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for this difference is the progenitor metallicity .",
    "@xcite showed , both analytically and through modelling , that a metal - rich progenitor produces less @xmath6ni , and as such is less luminous , than a metal - poor sn ia progenitor .",
    "if this difference in luminosity as a function of metallicity is accompanied by the same changes in color and light - curve stretch that normally occur in sne ia , then this environmental effect would not produce biased distance measurements .",
    "however , @xcite have recently shown that light - curve corrections tend to overcompensate for the metallicity effect .",
    "specifically , they show that for a given quantity of synthesized @xmath6ni , multi - dimensional models predict that a higher metallicity progenitor will produce a narrower light curve .",
    "this effect means that after standard light - curve corrections are applied , a high - metallicity progenitor would appear to be overluminous .",
    "several groups have recently shown that the host galaxy environment does in fact correlate with the hr , in the sense that more massive galaxies host overluminous ( for their light - curve shape ) sne ia @xcite . under the assumption that these galaxies all follow the mass - metallicity relationship derived in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter t04 ) , where high - mass galaxies have high metallicity , @xcite showed that their results are consistent with the metallicity / luminosity relation in @xcite .    knowing the true cause of the hr correlation with host galaxy properties is key for future deep sn surveys such as the dark energy survey ( des ) and the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ? ? ?",
    "while it is clear that correcting for this relationship would lead to decreased scatter in hrs , care must be taken to consider the change in galaxy properties with redshift .",
    "if progenitor metallicity truly is the cause of the observed correlation , and host mass is used as a proxy for the metallicity , then evolution in the mass - metallicity relationship as a function of redshift @xcite will bias the hubble diagram and our measurement of cosmological parameters . the correlation might instead be due to the relative prevelance of progenitor channels and thus depend on star - formation rate ( sfr ) , which will have a different redshift dependence .",
    "@xcite showed a correlation exists between stellar metallicities from passive galaxies and sn ia hrs at low redshifts ( @xmath7 ) , but no correlation between measured emission - line metallicities from star - forming galaxies ( sfg ) has yet been observed ( see * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , other factors may contribute part of the intrinsic scatter , such as explosion geometry @xcite , without being directly tied to host - galaxy properties .    in what follows",
    "we determine the relationship between hrs and both host galaxy metallicity and sfrs in a nearly unbiased sample of spectroscopically - observed host galaxies of sne ia discovered as part of the sdss - ii supernova survey .",

    "the sdss - sns  repeatedly surveyed the 300 square degree southern equatorial stripe ( designated stripe 82 ; see * ? ? ? * ) during the fall seasons ( september 1 - november 30 ) of 2005 - 2007 using the dedicated 2.5 meter sdss telescope at apache point observatory , new mexico @xcite .",

    "the sdss - sns  spectroscopically confirmed 504 sne ia over the duration of its three year survey .",
    "details of the spectroscopic observing campaign and the criteria by which targets were selected can be found in @xcite .",
    "an additional 210 transients with identifiable hosts have been designated photometrically probable sne ia .",
    "these objects did not have a spectrum taken during the survey , usually because they either ( a ) were not well separated from their host , or ( b ) were below the magnitude limit for our followup spectroscopy . however , these objects are highly likely to be sne ia as opposed to any of the core - collapse types based on their multicolor light curves and the redshifts obtained from spectra of their host galaxies .",
    "the updated photometric classifier code , containing more core - collapse templates and described in @xcite , was designed for the sdss - sns and has been shown to be accurate at determining sne ia with low contamination @xcite .",
    "where necessary we will refer to the spectroscopically - confirmed sample as spec ia sne and the photometrically - probable sample with identified hosts as phot ia sne .",
    "we derive distance moduli from our sample of sne ia with the snana code @xcite , using both the mlcs2k2  and salt2  light - curve fitters .",
    "light - curve quality cuts applied are the same as those in section 4 of the sdss - sns first - year cosmology paper @xcite , with the one exception being a more stringent requirement of at least one measurement at two days or more before peak brightness in the rest - frame _ b_-band according to mlcs2k2  ( t@xmath8 ) .",
    "these cuts remove sne ia that have low signal - to - noise measurements , insufficient temporal coverage , and peculiar light - curve shapes .",
    "distance moduli from salt2  light - curve fits are computed using the code ` salt2mu ' @xcite .",

    "hubble residuals are determined by subtracting the distance modulus of the assumed cosmology at the redshift of the host galaxy from that of the sn ( hr @xmath14 ) .",
    "we use the best - fit @xmath15cdm cosmology to the sdss - only sn sample from @xcite , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we assume a hubble constant of @xmath18 km sec@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 throughout this paper , though we note that the choice of hubble constant is irrelevant to our results , as @xmath20 is degenerate with the fiducial sn ia absolute luminosity .",
    "a point of emphasis in our analysis is to ensure that selection biases in our data set are minimized to the greatest extent possible . to this end",
    "we have limited our study to sne ia at redshifts @xmath0 , where it has been demonstrated that the selection efficiencies of the survey are such that the spec ia plus phot ia sne sample is complete @xcite .",
    "thus our results will not be biased by containing an over - abundance of intrinsically over - luminous sne ia .",
    "the galaxy spectra analyzed in this paper are hosts of the 140 spec ia and 7 phot ia sne at @xmath0 , of which 77 spec ia and 3 phot ia sne pass our light - curve quality cuts .",
    "a concerted effort is being undertaken to obtain galaxy - only spectra for all spec ia and phot ia sne discovered in the sdss - sns . for the low - redshift sample analyzed in this paper , this campaign is essentially complete ; we have host - galaxy spectra for 93% percent of the low-@xmath21 sample . over half of these sne",

    "* ) most of the remaining unobserved sne ia hosts with @xmath22 were targeted , including over a third of the low-@xmath21 sample .",
    "the faintest host galaxies were observed with the 8 m gemini - south telescope and are vital for the completeness of our sample , as the least luminous galaxies tend to have the lowest metallicities .",
    "the remainder of the host - galaxy spectra used in this analysis were obtained with the 3.5 m astrophysical research consortium telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) and the 3.6 m new technologies telescope ( ntt ) , which observed some hosts lacking sdss spectra before the boss and gemini observations were begun .",
    "the fact that we begin with a nearly complete sample of host - galaxy spectra is crucial , as this means we are not biased toward more luminous hosts .",
    "the parameters that we are attempting to directly measure ( metallicity , sfr ) are correlated with the absolute magnitude of a galaxy , as demonstrated in t04 : metal - poor galaxies tend to be faint , metal - rich galaxies bright .",
    "it is thus necessary to analyze hosts with a wide range of absolute magnitudes if we intend to measure a wide range of progenitor metallicities .",
    "we demonstrate in section  [ sec : res - complete ] that the final sample we use in this paper , after all of our data cuts are applied , still satisfies this criterion , though we are left with a much reduced data set .",

    "we took spectra in longslit mode with a 1.0 arcsec slit , no filter , and used the b600 grating .",
    "the approximate observed wavelength coverage was 3800 - 6700  .",
    "three exposures of duration 500 - 800 seconds each were taken for central wavelengths of both 520 and 525 nm , where the offset mitigates the effect of bad detector pixels in our reduced data .",
    "the data were binned 2 times in the spatial direction and 2 times in the spectral direction for a wavelength dispersion of 0.9   pixel@xmath19 .",
    "the b600 grating has a spectral resolution of @xmath23 at its blaze wavelength of @xmath24  when used with a 0.5 arcsec slit .",
    "we performed most of the data reduction using version 1.10 of the gemini iraf package .",
    "the raw two - dimensional ( 2d ) spectra are in multi - extension fits ( mef ) format ; we propagate the variance ( var ) and data quality ( dq ) planes throughout our reduction .",
    "we created mean bias frames by combining 5 bias frames from each observation night with gbias , and normalized flat frames were generated using gsflat .",
    "all science images and our spectral standard ( ltt9239 ) were then bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , and overscan subtracted with gsreduce .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using the task gswavelength and the cuar lamp spectra ( also processed with gsreduce ) taken at the time of observation .",
    "the wavelength calibration from the arc spectrum was applied to the 2d science spectra , which were then rectified using the task gstransform .",
    "the sensitivity function is determined by running the spectral standard through gsstandard , which is then applied to the galaxy spectra with gscalibrate .",
    "we do not use gsskysub , and instead apply gsextract immediately .",
    "this choice was made because gsextract uses the routine apall , which includes a sky subtraction procedure .",
    "if one runs gsskysub and then gsextract , the resulting variance spectrum incorrectly contains low uncertainty for regions that originally featured heavy sky contamination , as the sky - lines have been removed in the previous step .",
    "we also found that the gemini tasks do not correctly propagate the var and dq planes . in gsextract",
    ", the input dq plane is not used , and the output dq plane is simply set to be equal to 0 ( i.e. , ` good ' ) everywhere .",
    "the var plane output is the square of the uncertainty spectrum determined by the call to apall ; the var plane that had been propagated up to this point is simply discarded .",
    "we still use this spectrum to describe the uncertainties in our flux measurements as it is the same as we would have had , if we had performed the reduction procedure outside of the gemini suite of packages .",
    "deriving the gas - phase oxygen abundance and the ssfr requires accurately measuring the flux in specific emission lines of the sne ia host galaxies ; throughout this paper we will refer to the gas - phase oxygen abundance as ` metallicity ' , unless the context requires more clarity .",
    "our procedure for obtaining emission - line spectra from observed data closely follows that in t04 , in which a model of the continuum flux is subtracted from the observed spectrum .",
    "this corrects for absorption features superimposed on emission lines .",
    "we perform this analysis on all of our data , which totals 208 spectra from 138 host galaxies .",
    "we begin by correcting our spectra for extinction in the milky way along the line of sight @xcite , and then mask the spectra in the region about the balmer lines ( h@xmath9 , h@xmath10 , h@xmath25 , h@xmath26 ) and the forbidden lines ( [ o  ii ]  @xmath27@xmath28 , [ o  iii ]  @xmath27@xmath29 , [ n  ii ]  @xmath27@xmath30 , [ s  ii ]  @xmath27@xmath31 ) .",

    "is determined for the masked host spectrum through a least - squares analysis ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "the continuum - subtracted spectrum is then smoothed by subtracting off the average flux in a 200 pixel sliding window , with emission lines again masked from this average .",

    "we note that the lower- and upper - branch gemini metallicities of sn 2006la ( 8.36/8.39 ) agree with the boss value ( 8.44 ) , and that the sn 2007lo values , while different ( 8.16/8.79 for gemini , 8.53 for boss ) , both suggest a lower metallicity than the median from our sample .",

    "second , we can only include gemini - based measurements if both possible @xmath55-based metallicities fall within the same bin ; a solar - metallicity division would leave out two host galaxies whose branches straddle the dividing line , while our choice retains all gemini measurements .",

    "it is worth noting that only a fraction of the total intrinsic scatter in sn ia luminosity is explained by this correlation . subtracting the best - fit line in figure  [ fig : ssfrs ] from the hrs of the sfgs",

    "thus the relationship we find between ssfr@xmath76  and hr can not be dismissed as an artifact of the varying physical scales upon which our measurements are based .",
    "we do not correlate our measured sfr@xmath76  with hr because the measured sfr , being a cumulative quantity , will depend strongly on the percentage of a galaxy s physical size enclosed in a given observation ; this is why we previously chose to examine the global quantity sfr@xmath77 .",
    ", as a function of the fraction of total _ u_-band flux from the galaxy captured within the fiber .",
    "the absence of a correlation between ssfr@xmath76  and fiber - fraction suggests that an apparent dependence of hubble residuals on ssfr@xmath76  is not a function of our measurements originating from different physical scales .",
    "[ fig : uband],scaledwidth=100.0% ]    our results for ssfr@xmath76  presented in figure  [ fig : ssfrs ] show a rapidly evolving relationship in ssfr , while ssfr@xmath77  does not .",
    "this result lends itself to two questions .",
    "first , why do the two differ ? the ssfr@xmath77",
    "measurement requires an extrapolation of the sfr , assuming that the sfr scales with the _ u_-band magnitude .",
    "however , the lower the sfr in a galaxy , the higher the contribution to the flux in near - uv bands from older stars . thus the approximation we make would tend to overpredict the sfr in galaxies with less star - formation , leading to the type of narrow distribution of ssfrs that appear in figure  [ fig : ssfrp ] .",
    "the second question is whether the slope of the correlation between ssfr@xmath76  and hrs is compatible with previous works .",
    "figure  [ fig : ssfrs ] could be seen as being in contrast to the results of @xcite which , using photometric host - galaxy properties of sne ia from the sdss - sns , found a difference in hrs between sne ia in passive and sfg of @xmath100 magnitude .",
    "however , what we are measuring is the correlation with hr _ within _ the group of all sfg ; a more accurate comparison with @xcite would be the mean hr of all sne ia in sfgs ( plotted in figure  [ fig : ssfrs ] ) compared with that of sne ia found in passive galaxies .",
    "we define passive galaxies as those hosts where the h@xmath9 line is observed with s / n @xmath101 10 , and which fail at least one of the emission - line cuts described in section  [ sec : late ] . for the 15 passive host galaxies with a @xmath102 upper limit on ssfr below that of the lowest ssfr in figure  [ fig : ssfrs ]",
    ", we find an average hr of @xmath103 . compared to the average hr of @xmath104 in our sfg sample ,",
    "this is a difference of @xmath105 and in agreement with @xcite .",
    "additionally , if we split the sfgs into equally populated upper and lower bins , we find an average hr of @xmath106 in the higher ssfr bin and @xmath107 in the lower ssfr one , the latter of which is consistent with what we find in passive galaxies .",
    "the similar hrs we find in both passive hosts and our lower bin of ssfr demonstrates that the linear fit plotted in figure  [ fig : ssfrs ] , while a good representation of emission - line galaxies , does not capture the flattening of the trend at low ssfrs .",
    "l cccccc sfg & @xmath108 & @xmath109 & 12.4%(1.1@xmath75 ) & 5.1%(1.6@xmath75 ) & 19.9%(0.8@xmath75 ) & 12.9%(1.1@xmath75 ) + sfg+composites & @xmath110 & @xmath111 & 11.4%(1.2@xmath75 ) & 0.6%(2.6@xmath75 ) & 21.2%(0.8@xmath75 ) & 47.4%(@xmath1010.1@xmath75 ) +      we have obtained spectra for nearly all of the host galaxies of sne ia at redshifts @xmath78 , covering the full range of host - galaxy absolute magnitudes . combined with the completeness of the sdss - sns at these redshifts , we expect our study to be nearly free of selection bias with respect to both sn and host - galaxy parameters .",
    "however , having observed spectra for all of host galaxies does not mean that we are able to derive useful quantities from them all .",
    "a given galaxy spectrum can fail our emission - line s / n cuts for two reasons : either it is an elliptical galaxy and lacks these lines , or it is a low - luminosity galaxy .",
    "only the latter group is important , as a ` complete ' sample for our analysis by definition would exclude non - sfg .",
    "we lose some low - luminosity host - galaxies due to our data cuts , but the gemini spectra provide us with a high s / n sample of intrinsically faint hosts to prevent our final analysed sample from being skewed .",
    "figure  [ fig : ks ] shows the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of sne ia host - galaxy _ r_-band absolute magnitudes for all spec ia and phot ia sne at @xmath78 .",
    "all galaxy magnitudes were obtained from the sdss cas , then de - reddened using the dust maps of @xcite and k - corrected using the code kcorrect v4.1.4 @xcite . included in the plot",
    "is the host - galaxy cdf for all sne ia in this redshift range that pass the selection requirements for having a distance modulus measurement ; it is clear that this cut introduces no bias into the host magnitude distribution .",
    "also plotted is the sample which we draw our analysis from , the host galaxies that pass our s / n and agn cuts ( see section  [ sec : late ] ) .",
    "we have far fewer bright galaxies , where m@xmath112 , but this is primarily due to the fact that many of these galaxies are passive . at the low - luminosity end",
    ", we are missing useful spectra for the faintest 5% of host - galaxies .",
    "this includes 4 of the 5 faintest hosts , 3 of which we observed with gemini but were still of too low s / n for a metallicity measurement .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows a 23% chance that the final host - galaxy magnitude distribution which we use in our analysis is drawn from the same sample as the sample which passes all snana cuts . considering that we know of and expect the differences that do exist between the two distributions , it is reasonable to state that the host - galaxy properties in this paper approximate that of an unbiased sample .",
    "based on salt2 , and 3 ) sne ia with both a @xmath113 and a measurement of the host gas - phase oxygen abundance , based on emission - line diagnostics .",
    "all samples are for @xmath78 .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test does not disfavor sample ( 3 ) - from which our final anaylsis is done - being drawn from the same distribution as sample ( 2 ) .",
    "the differences which do appear between the samples are explained in section [ sec : res - complete ] . [",
    "fig : ks],scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "we have examined correlations between spectroscopic host - galaxy properties in a nearly unbiased sample with sn ia hubble residuals for the first time ( see @xcite for a recent analysis of a larger but biased sample with sdss sne ; @xcite for an unbiased sample with multi - wavelength host - galaxy properties , also using sdss sne ) .",
    "we find evidence at @xmath114 of higher metallicity galaxies hosting overluminous sne ia ( after light - curve corrections are applied ) when compared to lower metallicity hosts , with a difference in the mean hr of @xmath100 magnitudes .",
    "however , the number of sne ia for which we have host - galaxy observations is insufficient to strongly constrain the nature of the relationship between the hr and metallicity , as evidenced by the much lower significance of a correlation returned by the linmix package .",
    "we also find at @xmath4 confidence evidence of galaxies with low ssfrs hosting overluminous sne , with a difference of @xmath100 magnitudes between passive and star - forming hosts .",
    "the observed hr correlations are in the same direction as expected on theoretical grounds ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* though larger in magnitude ) , so it is possible to take this as evidence of the overluminosity ( after light - curve corrections ) of sne ia from metal - rich progenitors .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , the difficulty in associating host - galaxy measurements with the properties of a sne progenitors . the metallicity measurement used in this paper is indicative of the gas - phase oxygen abundance , which is most closely associated with episodes of recent star formation . while this should be strongly correlated with core - collapse sn progenitors , it is less clear how well this measurement relates to the older , lower mass progentiors of sne ia .",
    "in addition , whether we use the ` global ' or ` full ' sample in our analysis , the metallicity we are measuring is averaged over a large physical area , and in many cases is not derived from any galaxy light from the region where the sn occured .",
    "a useful future study would be centered not on the galaxy but the sn location itself ; though given the long duration between the formation of the progenitor star and the detonation of the evolved white dwarf , it is uncertain that the location of the explosion is the region where the progenitor formed .    supposing that the sfr we measure is representative of the environment of the sn progenitor , what does a correlation between this quantity and sne ia hrs imply ?",
    "several studies have shown evidence of there being two populations of sne ia : ` prompt ' and ` delayed ' , the monikers referring to the time elapsed since the formation of the progenitor @xcite .",
    "it is possible , then , that the galaxies we observe to have high ssfr are , on average , hosts of the ` prompt ' population , while galaxies with a low ssfr are hosts to the ` delayed ' population .",
    "however , the diagnostic which we use to measure sfr tells us about only the past @xmath67  years , which is below the timescale on which even the ` prompt ' sne ia progenitors transition from formation to explosion .",
    "it is also possible that the ssfr is simply acting as a tracer of metallicity , meaning that the correlation which we measure between hrs and ssfr is really one of hrs and progenitor metallicity .",
    "it is well known that for a given galaxy mass , gas - phase metallicity decreases as sfr increases ( see , eg . * ? ? ?",
    "thus , a positive hr ",
    "ssfr correlation is analogous to a negative hr  z relationship , which are shown in sections  [ sec : res - metal ] and [ sec : res - ssfr ] . given the small number of host galaxies we analyze in this work , we are unable to determine whether our results are a result of this degeneracy , or whether there are two distinct trends of age and metallicity with hr .",
    "we note that the importance of the question , ` is the measured galaxy metallicity strongly related to the progenitor metallicity , ' has led to it recently being addressed theoretically by @xcite .",
    "they find that the host metallicity _ does _ provide a good estimate of the sn metallicity in the case of an actively star - forming galaxy , which are the type of hosts that have been analyzed in this work .",
    "given that we are using integrated galaxy spectra in an attempt to constrain properties of a single star - one which has since ceased to exist - it is inevitable that there be caveats and uncertainties regarding the precise relationship between the observable and the object of interest . but the effort is worthwhile , as the origin of the intrinsic error in the hubble diagram and any bias it may induce as a function of redshifts will contribute a significant systematic uncertainty that upcoming wide , deep surveys ( des , lsst ) will face in the pursuit of constraining cosmology with sne ia .",
