    "stochastic resonance is the remarkable physical phenomenon where a signal that is normally too weak to be detected by a sensor , can be boosted by adding noise to the system .",
    "it has been initially proposed in the context of climate studies , as an explanation of the recurrence of ice ages @xcite , and subsequently the phenomenon has been reported in other fields , such as biology and neurosciences , and extensively studied in many different physical settings .",
    "it is not possible here to account for the huge literature on the subject but we refer to @xcite for a comprehensive review , while an exhaustive discussion of the literature in different fields can be found in @xcite .",
    "of particular relevance are the mathematical studies of the phenomenon in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper , we study one of the models for stochastic resonance from a random dynamical systems point of view . despite the obvious merit of gaining insight in stochastic processes from a dynamical systems standpoint , and various research programmes in this direction ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , the mathematical field of random dynamical systems is still in its infancy .",
    "our study of stochastic resonance , as a prototypical dynamical phenomenon in stochastic systems , illustrates how this approach provides additional insights to phenomena of broad physical interest . in the process",
    ", we extend the existing random dynamical systems theory in the direction of nonautonomous stochastic differential equations , to aid the analysis of the particular model at hand .",
    "we note in this context that whereas autonomous stochastic differential equations are widely studied , nonautonomous stochastic differential equations received much less attention @xcite and we also mention @xcite for pioneering work on random periodic solutions of random dynamical systems .",
    "we study one of the simplest stochastic differential equations used to model stochastic resonance , commonly motivated by taking an overdamped limit of a stochastically driven duffing oscillator @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes a wiener process .",
    "the full model describes a damped particle in a periodically oscillating double - well potential in the presence of noise .",
    "the periodic driving tilts the double - well potential asymmetrically up and down , raising and lowering the potential barrier .",
    "if the periodic forcing alone is too weak for the particle to leave one potential well , the noise strength can be tuned so that hopping between the wells is synchronised with the periodic forcing and the average waiting time between two noise - induced hops is comparable with the period of the forcing . for increasing noise strength , the periodicity is lost and the hopping becomes increasingly random .",
    "it is important to observe that ( [ sr ] ) has , in addition to the noise , also an explicit deterministic dependence on time .",
    "we refer to such systems as _ nonautonomous stochastic differential equations_. in the model at hand , the deterministic time - dependence is periodic , which facilitates the analysis in a crucial way .",
    "we establish a random dynamical systems point of view for nonautonomous stochastic differential equations . in this context",
    "we aim to describe the long - time asymptotic behaviour of ( [ sr ] ) in terms of ( random ) attractors and we prove the following :    [ th1 ] the sde ( [ sr ] ) has a unique globally attracting random periodic orbit .    in terms of the dynamics , if we denote by @xmath2 the random dynamical system   induced by ( [ sr ] ) on @xmath3 from time @xmath4 to @xmath5 and for a realisation @xmath6 of the wiener process , this means that for any bounded set @xmath7 , the limit @xmath8 is a single point @xmath9 for all @xmath10 and almost all @xmath6 .",
    "we note that @xmath11 is a random variable that evolves under the stochastic flow as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 where @xmath14 , justifying the nomenclature _ random periodic orbit_.    the attractor provides all the dynamical information for the system and it is accompanied by a natural set of probability measures : first of all a singleton distribution @xmath15 associated to the random periodic orbit .",

    "we now proceed to discuss the phenomenon of stochastic resonance within the above point of view .",
    "stochastic resonance in the context of our model is measured in terms of the enhancement of the periodic behaviour of the nonautonomous forcing as a function of the size of the noise . in fig .",
    "[ figsr ] we present representative time series of for three different noise amplitude levels @xmath33 : before , during and after the stochastic resonance regime .",
    "the phenomenon of stochastic resonance is characterized by a @xmath19-period hopping between the left and right potential wells , present in the middle plot but absent in the leftmost and rightmost plots .",
    "the resonant regime can be identified in various ways .",
    "the classical experimental indicator is the signal to noise ratio , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "our establishment of the existence of a unique globally attracting random periodic point with invariant measures @xmath34 provides the opportunity to define other indicators with more mathematically rigorous footing .",
    "as proposed already by @xcite ( but without a rigorous discussion of existence ) , one can for instance consider the expectation @xmath35 , which due to the periodicity of @xmath34 is also @xmath19-periodic .",
    "the size of the amplitude of this oscillating function , @xmath36 is a natural indicator for stochastic resonance .",
    "however , as @xmath37 does not really measure the likelihood of a time series to hop from left to right in resonance with the driving frequency , we here propose an alternative indicator which directly relates to the amount of transport between the wells across the barrier at @xmath38 over a time period @xmath19 .",
    "define the two probabilities @xmath39 ) -\\min_{0\\le t <",

    "the product of these two probabilities @xmath43 is a lower bound for a particle to switch the well two times within the period @xmath19 , and thus serves as an indicator for stochastic resonance . in fig .",
