    "recent experimental progress has enabled imaging of coherent current flow dynamics in quantum point contacts formed in semiconductor heterostructures.@xcite these advances in experimental techniques open the possibility that current flow through atomic or molecular junctions will be eventually imaged and controlled .",
    "understanding the microscopic electronic flow patterns can aid the design of novel electronic devices .",
    "however , very few theoretical studies of current dynamics in nanoscale systems are currently available .",
    "indeed , among the recent theoretical studies of transport in nanoscale systems , much emphasis has been placed on the steady - state conduction properties,@xcite whereas the transient behavior of the current remains an unexplored area .",
    "electronic transport in nanoscale junctions is usually formulated within the stationary scattering picture , such as the one due to landauer,@xcite in which the conduction is treated as a collection of scattering events .",
    "this stationary approach , widely used to study transport in mesoscopic and nanoscale systems , has led to considerable success in understanding current - related effects other than the conductance , including , e.g. , noise , local heating , and current - induced forces.@xcite it has helped our understanding of the microscopic current distribution as well.@xcite nevertheless , the stationary approach assumes that the system is already in a steady state , leaving the questions of how a steady current establishes itself and what other phenomena are related to the dynamical formation of steady states in a nanojunction unsolved .",
    "the dynamical nature of the current flow is better addressed in a time - dependent approach than in the stationary one .",
    "time - dependent or ac transport approaches have been previously introduced in mesoscopic conducting systems.@xcite recently , an increasing amount of effort has been directed toward developing ab - initio time- dependent approaches for nanoscale systems.@xcite one such method was developed to study the ac conductance using the time - dependent density functional theory@xcite(tddft ) combined with absorbing boundary conditions.@xcite this method , however , is affected by the arbitrariness of how and where the absorbing potentials are added , while the effect of the absorbing potential on the conduction in nanojunctions is unclear .",
    "other methods have been developed based on the landauer scattering formalism of transport that employ open boundary conditions.@xcite    more recently , a microcanonical formalism that treats electronic transport as a discharge across a nanocontact connecting two large but finite charged electrodes was introduced.@xcite the formulation has been combined with tddft to study the dynamical formation of quasi - steady currents , local chemical potentials,@xcite and electron - ion interactions.@xcite this formalism would yield the exact total current flowing from one electrode to the other if the exact functional were known , regardless of whether the system achieves a steady state . in practice , in ab - initio transport calculations , one only uses approximate forms of the functional such as the adiabatic local density approximation ( alda ) .",
    "it has been shown recently that the electronic correlation effect beyond the alda gives rise to additional resistance in molecular junctions.@xcite the spurious self - interaction implicit in the alda further complicates calculations of the conduction properties.@xcite the sensitivity of various transport properties to the suggested corrections remains only partially understood .",
    "the dynamical establishment of a quasi - steady current has been investigated by a number of authors.@xcite it has been demonstrated that a quasi - steady current can establish itself across a junction on a femtosecond time scale without the presence of inelastic scattering.@xcite this is due to the geometrical `` squeezing '' experienced by the electrons crossing the nanojunction.@xcite the conductance calculated from the microcanonical formula was shown to be in good agreement with that obtained from the static dft approach in prototypical atomic junctions@xcite as well as in molecular junctions.@xcite nevertheless , a study of the microscopic behavior of the electron flow , and in particular of the current flow morphology in nanojunctions , is still lacking .    in this paper , we carry out real - time numerical simulations of current flow in metallic nanojunctions using the microcanonical formalism , where we employ tddft within the alda .",
    "we restrict the forthcoming discussion to the dynamical behavior of electron / hole charges in the nanojunctions under the linear response regime , i.e. , in which the bias is small and the current - voltage characteristics are linear .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : methods ] we discuss model transport systems and numerical methods . in sec.[sec : results ] , we present and discuss simulations of current dynamics in jellium and atomic junctions .",
    "we also analyze the effects of hydrodynamic pressure and electrode surface charges on the dynamics of the flow . in sec.[sec : conclusions ] , we summarize the main conclusions of our work .    , a bias in the form of @xmath0 $ ] is applied to the junction ( the central constriction is at @xmath1 ) such that the regions @xmath2 bear a potential offset from the central constriction , where @xmath3 is the heaviside step function.,width=211 ]",
    "the nanoscale junction geometry studied in this paper is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "a narrow constriction separates two large but finite electrodes .",
    "we begin the simulations by applying a step function - like electric bias across the junction such that the two electrodes bear equal and opposite potentials offset relative to the potential at the center of the junction .",
    "the distance from the bias discontinuity to the center of the junction is @xmath4 ( see fig.[fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "this bias induces a charge imbalance between the two sides of the system . at @xmath5 ,",
    "we remove the bias and a discharge through the nanojunction ensues .",
    "the kohn - sham initial state therefore corresponds to the ground state of the hamiltonian in the presence of the bias . here , we are interested in the transient behavior during the phase in which the current is in the process of establishing a quasi - steady state and immediately thereafter , i.e. , long before the electrons that have passed through the constriction have had chance to reach the far boundary of the electrodes .    to separate the effects of the electrons and of the atomic lattice , we have carried out calculations using a jellium model and an atomic model . in the jellium calculations , the electrodes are represented by two large jellium slabs 2.8   thick .",
    "the contact is a rectangular jellium block 2.8 wide and as thick as the electrodes .",
    "the distance between the jellium electrodes is 9.8  . in the atomic calculations ,",
    "the junction is represented by two planar arrays of gold atoms sandwiching a single gold atom .",
    "we employ tddft and solve the effective single - particle schr dinger equation @xmath6\\psi({\\vec r},t ) , \\ ] ] where the effective potential is given by @xmath7    the term @xmath8 is the exchange - correlation potential calculated within the adiabatic local- density approximation .",
    "the external ( ionic ) potential is modeled using pseudopotentials for the atomic calculations,@xcite while in the jellium model it is a local operator related to the uniform positive background jellium density @xmath9 via @xmath10 , where @xmath11 equals to @xmath12 inside the jellium and zero outside , and @xmath13 is the wigner - seitz radius . in the jellium model , we choose @xmath14 ( @xmath15 = bohr radius ) which gives a good representation of bulk gold ( see also discussion below ) . a `` free- space '' boundary condition",
    "is implemented such that the long - range potential is constructed only from the densities in the supercell;@xcite that is , the system is not periodic .",
    "additional numerical details can be found in appendix  [ num ] .",
    "the single - particle time - dependent current density is calculated via @xmath16 , \\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes individual kohn - sham single - particle states .",
    "note that in tddft the current density is not necessarily exact even if one calculates it with the exact functional ( via the continuity equation , only the divergence of the current density would be exact ) .",
    "one would need to resort to time - dependent current density functional theory ( tdcdft )  @xcite to obtain the exact current density ( with the exact functional ) .",
    "nonetheless , due to the small viscosity of the electron liquid , we have found that the current density one obtains by using tddft within the alda , and the one obtained by tdcdft within the vignale - kohn functional  @xcite are qualitatively similar .",
    "@xcite    even if the contact between the electrodes were removed , the current between the two electrodes would not completely vanish because of quantum tunneling .",
    "this bare tunneling current can conveniently be used to compare the jellium and the atomic calculations .",
    "the jellium edges are placed at half the interplanar spacing of the lattice.@xcite this way , the jellium model and the pseudopotential calculations both yield tunneling current densities of @xmath18 0.05 @xmath19a / @xmath20 at a bias of 0.2v .",
    "the agreement indicates that the jellium model is a good representation of two large metal electrodes .",
    "this is consistent with the results of previous density - functional calculations.@xcite",
    "in a nanojunction such as an atomic point contact , the dimensions of the leads are usually much larger than those of the central constriction . in addition , not far from the contact , we expect the electron momentum to converge to the value characteristic of the bulk leads",
    ". therefore , the momentum of an electron coming from the leads and entering the contact has to change considerably .",
    "this gives rise to resistance , and for a truly nanoscale junction , this momentum mismatch is mainly responsible for the establishment of quasi - steady states.@xcite using the above dynamical approach we can now study how this translates into microscopic current flow through the nanocontact and into the leads by calculating the current density at different times .    to begin",
    ", we follow the method described in the preceding section to impose a charge imbalance in the jellium model system .",
    "a discussion of the effect of the lattice on the flow dynamics will be presented in the following section .",
    "the initial bias is chosen such that the discontinuity happens at the edge of the jellium slab near the central constriction ( i.e. , @xmath21  ) .",
    "the flow pattern is independent of the location of the discontinuity once the current starts to flow through the center of the junction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cur_jel ] , we plot three snapshots of the current density to illustrate the evolution of the flow .",
    "due to the bias offset near the jellium edges , a dipolar layer forms on each of the two contact - electrode interfaces .",
    "as a result , the initial current flow is uniform on both sides as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cur_jel](a ) .",
    "very little current flows in the nanojunction at this point , however the current steadily rises . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cur_jel](b ) , the current density becomes convergent toward the center of the nanojunction .",
    "interestingly , as the excess charge from the left electrode reaches the contact , there is a period of adjustment during which the dominant flow is in the lateral direction , i.e. , parallel to the facing surfaces of the electrodes .            to quantify the evolution of the angular distribution of the electron flow , in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial_jel ] we plot a time series of the radial component of the current density along a semicircle contour centered on the junction as a function of the angle on the semicircle ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cur_jel ] ( a ) ) .",
    "one can see that initially a `` wave '' of excess charge approaches the nanocontact . then , the radial current density peaks at very large angles ( @xmath22 ) ; i.e. , the current density near the contact is dominated by the flow along the electrode edges in the lateral direction . the peaks then gradually move towards the central axis , and the current density adjusts to a more `` focused '' pattern as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cur_jel](c ) .",
    "we have also examined a junction consisting of a jellium circular `` island '' between the electrodes . we have also observed edge flow in this case as well .",
    "the edge flow is not a quantum interference pattern , and can not be compared with the fringes observed in the 2d electron gas quantum point contacts.@xcite instead , we suggest that the flow pattern is controlled by hydrodynamic effects and forces due to surface charges .",
    "we analyze these in sec .",
    "[ sec : surf ] .",
    "the structure of the current density is analogous to a classical fluid flowing across a narrow constriction .",
    "this is not surprising because an inhomogeneous electron system can be indeed characterized by a set of hydrodynamical relations expressed in terms of the particle density and velocity field.@xcite more recently , in particular , a hydrodynamical approach was proposed for nanoscale transport systems,@xcite further strengthening the analogy between the dynamics of the electron liquid and the one of a classical liquid .",
    "we note that the present calculations do not take into account the physical viscosity of the electron liquid.@xcite an inviscid fluid can therefore be used as a model for the dynamical behavior of the present electron liquid .",
    "the jellium model was a convenient way to probe the microscopic current dynamics in an electron gas . to understand the influence of the lattice on the flow , we carried out simulations that included an ionic background modeled by pseudopotentials .",
    "the atomic calculations were carried out for 2-d gold nanojunctions and were initialized in the same way as the jellium calculations .",
    "the theoretical and experimental conductance are in very good agreement for this system.@xcite we chose lattice arrangements that correspond to the ( 001 ) and ( 111 ) facets of the gold fcc lattice ( the dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : cur_at ] represent the atomic sites for the ( 001 ) configuration ) .",
    "electric current streamlines at different times in the simulation are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cur_at](a ) - ( d ) .",
    "the streamlines are calculated by integrating the current density field upstream and downstream , @xmath23 .",
    "the morphology of the current flow in the atomic junction and in the jellium model is remarkably similar,@xcite indicating that the jellium model is a good representation of the gold electrodes .",
    "nevertheless , a number of new features appear in the atomic calculations .",
    "[ fig : cur_at](c ) shows that once a steady flow through the junction is established , the current spreads into a wedge - shaped region inside the electrodes .",
    "the flow morphology for each of the two different lattice arrangements is similar except that the flow spreads over a broader wedge - shaped region in the ( 111 ) lattice .",
    "another common feature in the atomic calculations is the presence of a stagnant zone at the corner of the electrode boundary .",
    "there is little current flow into or out of this zone .",
    "this is similar to a classical fluid where a stagnant zone can sometimes be located at the entrance or exit of a channel .",
    "one profound difference between the atomic and the jellium calculations is the formation of eddies evident in the former but not in the latter . in the jellium calculations carried out within the linear - response bias regime , the current flux lines are laminar .",
    "in contrast , in the atomic calculations , the eddies appear as localized circular flow that can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cur_at](d ) .",
    "the eddies develop in both electrodes and the size of the eddies is comparable to the interatomic distance .",
    "the eddies are reminiscent of the vortices that form in a classical fluid at higher reynolds number when the fluid encounters obstacles .",
    "as is well known , vortices can also occur when velocity shear is present within a continuous fluid ( kelvin - helmholtz instability ) .",
    "we suggest that the lattice ionic obstacles and the boundaries separating the flow zone and the stagnant zone facilitate the formation of the observed eddies in our simulations .",
    "the formation of current vortices has been previously reported in 2d ballistic quantum billiards.@xcite in these quantum systems , a rich variety of flow patterns ranging from regular to chaotic is possible . while we can not draw direct analogies with these open and mesoscopic transport systems , an unstable and turbulent flow has been recently predicted in nanoscale systems@xcite .",
    "we have argued that the alda electron liquid in our simulations corresponds approximately to an inviscid fluid .",
    "we therefore suggest that in the presence of a lattice , hydrodynamical instabilities , or turbulence can occur in nanotransport systems even in the absence of a physical viscosity .      to understand what drives the edge flow along the electrode surfaces",
    ", we examine the evolution of the charge distribution near the surfaces of the junction . for this purpose",
    ", we apply a step - function bias such that the potential discontinuity in each electrode occurs at @xmath24 , which cuts across the electrode , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nz_contour](a ) , we plot a time series of the @xmath25 plane - averaged excess charge density along the @xmath26 axis . at @xmath5 ,",
    "two symmetric dipolar layers form inside the electrodes as a result of the bias offsets . as the current starts to flow through the contact and gradually reaches a quasi - steady state , a global charge redistribution becomes apparent .",
    "the dipolar layers gradually vanish and are replaced by surface charge layers that form at the contact- electrode interfaces .",
    "the charge contour plots fig .",
    "[ fig : nz_contour](b - c ) further illustrate the formation of surface charges as a result of current flow .",
    "to @xmath27 fs for a jellium junction .",
    "the change in the peaks indicates the dynamic process in which excess charge builds up at the surfaces .",
    "the sign of the surface charges indicates that electron charges accumulates on the right and hole charges on the left .",
    "( b ) - ( c ) excess charge in the vicinity of the contact at @xmath28 0 and @xmath28 0.6 fs .",
    "thick solid lines indicate excess electrons , while thick dashed lines indicate excess holes .",
    "thin dashed lines mark the edges of the jellium electrodes and the contact.,width=336 ]    the formation of surface charges around the central constriction is reminiscent of the formation of residual - resistivity dipoles introduced by landauer.@xcite it has been suggested that a continuous current flow arriving at a junction must be accompanied by self - consistently formed charges at the electrode surfaces.@xcite the effect should be taken into account to correctly characterize the electrostatic potential and the nonequilibrium conducting properties in a transport calculation.@xcite in this work we provide the first numerical demonstration of the dynamical formation of these surface charges using a time - dependent approach .",
    "we have already observed that , as the surfaces of the electrodes are populated by excess charges , a lateral flow starts to develop along the surfaces .",
    "this behavior is illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : radial_jel ] where the radial current flux at @xmath29 fs shows two pronounced peaks at very large angles .",
    "we attempt to interpret this behavior within the framework of an effective classic hydrodynamic model of an inviscid charged fluid .",
    "the acceleration of the fluid is then given by euler s equation @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the fluid velocity , @xmath32 is the fluid particle density , @xmath33 is the electron mass , and @xmath34 is the electrostatic potential . the first term on the right hand side is the acceleration due to a gradient in electron pressure .",
    "the second term is the acceleration due to the electric field of the excess charges on the surfaces of the electrode .",
    "the electric field drives the electrons / holes toward the surfaces to cancel out the excess charges .",
    "the inertial term in the above equation can be estimated as @xmath35 . here",
    ", @xmath36 denotes the characteristic length scale over which we expect a departure from uniform flow , so that @xmath37",
    ". velocity of the flow in the simulation reaches @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the fermi velocity of bulk gold .",
    "the hydrodynamical pressure can be calculated from the derivative of the ground state energy with respective to @xmath13 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the energy per particle.@xcite therefore , @xmath42 . here",
    ", we included only the ground state energy of a noninteracting electron gas , @xmath43.@xcite let @xmath44 denote the change of the particle density as a result of the current or the formation of the surface charges . for the present junctions at these biases , we find that typically @xmath45 .",
    "then , the acceleration due to the pressure gradient is @xmath46    to estimate the magnitude of the electrostatic acceleration , we treat the layer of charge induced on the facing surfaces of the electrodes ( as illustrated in fig.[fig : nz_contour]c ) as an infinite uniformly charged wire .",
    "the electric field of the wire is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the linear density of excess charge , @xmath36 is the distance to the wire , and @xmath49 is the vacuum permittivity .",
    "the linear charge density is calculated by averaging the charge density difference @xmath50 between the configuration with and without the current flow over the layer in which the charge accumulated at the contact - electrode interfaces .",
    "for the same junctions , we find @xmath51 .",
    "the acceleration of charges due to this electric field can be calculated as @xmath52    these crude estimates imply that over the same distance @xmath36 @xmath53 which suggests that the hydrodynamic pressure gradients dominate over the inertia of the fluid ( the flow is subsonic and compressible ) , while the maximum electrostatic force due to the surface charges is comparable to or larger than the pressure gradient force before the surface charge has been passivated .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that the lateral flow observed in the simulation is primarily of electrostatic origin . in different junction geometries or in a different conductance regime , the ordering in eq .",
    "[ eq : ordering ] may be different .",
    "we have also carried out a similar simulation using a parabolically- shaped constriction that resembles a quantum point contact in the 2d electron gas . at a similar bias as in the non - parabolic junctions ,",
    "we find similar surface charge accumulation along the boundaries of the electrodes in the vicinity of the contact .",
    "we believe the analysis we have provided on the surface charge formation applies to this case as well . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the accumulation of the surface charges has not been reported in adiabatic quantum point contacts before .",
    "it would thus be interesting to develop experimental techniques to explore the surface region of the quantum point contact in a 2d electron gas and the charge accumulation that we observe in our simulations .",
    "in this paper , we have used the microcanonical approach  @xcite to study the time - dependent current flow morphology and the charge distribution in discharging nanojunctions represented by both a jellium model and pseudopotentials .",
    "we have showed that the electron flow in the nanojunctions exhibits hydrodynamic features analogous to a classical fluid .",
    "we have found that in the atomic case the current flow evolves into wedge - shaped pattern flanked by stagnant zones .",
    "the flow develops nonlaminar features including eddy currents .",
    "we suggest that the ionic lattice at the junction plays the role of `` obstacles '' in the dynamics of the electron liquid , with consequent development of these features .",
    "we have also demonstrated that excess surface charges accumulate dynamically along the electrodes .",
    "in addition , we have observed that for a period of time , there is strong current flow in the transverse direction . by employing an order - of - magnitude argument",
    "we suggest that this flow is driven by both hydrodynamic forces due to the electron pressure , and electrostatic forces due to the surface charge distributions .",
    "the latter forces dominate the initial dynamics in the junctions at hand .    the present and a previous study@xcite demonstrate that the microcanonical approach combined with time - dependent density - functional theory can be used to probe the transient behavior of the current in nanojunctions such as atomic - scale point contacts or molecular junctions .",
    "@xcite the present approach supplements existing methods that are based on the static scattering picture and provides another tool to studying relatively unexplored nanoscale transport phenomena from first principles .",
    "the flow patterns we observe in metallic nanojunctions can be generalized to a number of other systems , such as molecular junctions , although many details may vary . in view of the recent advances in microscopic imaging techniques of coherent current flow in quantum point contacts in a 2d electron gas,@xcite",
    "we hope that new experimental work exploring the behavior of current flow in atomic contacts and molecular junctions will soon emerge to supplement our studies .",
