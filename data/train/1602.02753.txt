    "over the past 40 years , gravitational lensing has become a valuable astrophysical tool for detailed studies of the internal structure of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) and estimates of the values of the cosmological parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "weak lensing has allowed us to measure the total mass profile in the external regions of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while strong lensing has given us some of the most accurate measurements of the total mass of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) and galaxy clusters within their einstein radii , @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the lensing cross - section depends on the mass of a lens , so far the majority of strong lensing galaxies that have been investigated are massive .",
    "the lensing cross - section of galaxies is naturally enhanced in overdense environments , because of the mass contribution of the hosting group or cluster .",
    "therefore , it is there that strong lensing systems around low - mass galaxies are more likely to be observed .",
    "these systems are usually complex and require careful analyses to properly take into account the different mass components .",
    "nonetheless , by combining strong lensing with photometric and dynamical models , we can extend to these lenses our knowledge about their central amount of dark matter , dm .",
    "recent surveys , like the sloan lens acs survey , slacs @xcite , and the cluster lensing and supernova survey with hubble , clash ( pi : postman ; @xcite ) , have significantly increased the number of strong lenses observed within galaxy clusters and groups and have shown a number of low - mass lens galaxies with resolved multiple images .",
    "this paper takes advantage of the clash data collected using the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) to study a lensing system in which the lens is a member galaxy of a cluster in the sample .",
    "clash is a programme which observed , between november 2010 and july 2013 , 25 galaxy clusters in 16 passbands , from the near - uv to the near - ir , totalling 524 orbits of time on _ hst_. the spectroscopic follow - up programme , clash - vlt ( 186.a-0798 , pi : rosati ; @xcite ) , started in october 2010 and obtained data using the visible multiobject spectrograph ( vimos ) instrument at the very large telescope ( vlt ) of the european southern observatory .",
    "the main goal of these programmes is to measure accurately the total mass profiles of a statistically significant sample of galaxy clusters through different total mass diagnostics .",
    "the use of strong gravitational lensing to study low - mass galaxies is relatively new ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter g14 , and @xcite , hereafter s15 ) and it offers us the opportunity to test the interplay between ordinary , baryonic matter and dm at different mass scales .",
    "the aim of this work is to extend strong lensing analyses to low - mass galaxies .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] introduces the lensing system and the available data .",
    "section  [ sec : modelling ] describes our photometric and lensing models . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the results on the galaxy dm fractions , and compare them with those of previous strong lensing studies .",
    "the standard @xmath13cdm model is adopted throughout this paper , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . at the cluster redshift",
    ", @xmath17 corresponds to 4.97 kpc .",
    "the lens galaxies presented in this paper , hereafter referred to as g1 and g2 , are spectroscopically confirmed members of one of the clash galaxy clusters , i.e. macs j1115.9@xmath10129 .",
    "g1 is the main lens around which four images of a single background source are visible.the potentials of both g2 and the galaxy cluster as a whole also contribute significantly to the displacement of the multiple images .",
    "figure  [ fig : lens ] shows the optical observations taken with the subaru and _ hst _ telescopes and table  [ tab : positions ] gives the coordinates and spectroscopic redshifts of all objects relevant to the system .",
    "g1 is approximately 120@xmath18 ( i.e. , 600 kpc ) away from the cluster centre , assumed here to be coincident with the luminosity centre of the brightest cluster galaxy , bcg .",
    "the average distance of the four multiple images from the centre of g1 is @xmath19 kpc and this value is used as an effective einstein radius in the following , when looking at the different lensing models .",
    "the bcg is located at r.a.@xmath20 11:15:51.90 and dec.@xmath20 + 01:29:55.0 and the cluster redshift is @xmath21 .",
    ".the coordinates and spectroscopic redshifts of g1 , g2 and the multiple images ( a , b , c and d ) .",
    "the coordinates of g1 , the bcg and the multiple images were estimated using the _ hst / acs _ observations , whereas subaru observations were used for g2 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we concentrate on the lens projected luminous over total mass fractions , defined as @xmath22    the study by @xcite , which considered approximately @xmath23 massive early - type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey data release seven , concludes that the mean value of @xmath24 is @xmath25 , when a chabrier stellar imf is adopted to estimate the galaxy luminous masses . with the same stellar imf , a more recent analysis by s15 in galaxies with stellar velocity dispersions down to about 140  km  s@xmath7 finds that the mean value of @xmath26 is @xmath27 ( where the quoted error is the standard error of the mean for the 98 class - a lens galaxies in the studied sample , and a class - a lens is defined as a strong gravitational lens with clear and definite multiply lensed images or a complete einstein ring ) .",
    "little is known on the values of @xmath24 and @xmath26 at lower mass scales .",
    "one lens galaxy with an effective velocity dispersion of approximately 100 km s@xmath7 has been investigated in g14 . in figure",
    "[ fig : mass_fractions ] , we show a comparison of our @xmath24 and @xmath26 values with those presented in g14 and s15 .",
    "it should be noted that in g14 a salpeter stellar imf was used .",
    "thus , in figure  [ fig : mass_fractions ] the values of that study have been divided by a factor of 1.7 to be converted into the corresponding values for a chabrier stellar imf .",
    "starting from the total luminous mass values and luminosity profiles obtained in section  [ sec : modelling ] and the total mass values listed in table  [ tab : mass_and_velocity ] , we estimate the values of @xmath28 of g1 and g2 within different radii .",
    "when comparing with @xcite , we get values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "when comparing with s15 , we obtain values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we notice that the projected luminous over total mass fractions of g2 are consistent with those of the galaxies in @xcite and s15 .",
    "interestingly , in g1 we find very low values of @xmath28 , suggesting that this galaxy might contain a large amount of dark matter already within its core and significantly deviate from the results obtained for galaxies with masses exceeding @xmath33 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mass_fractions ] , there is a hint of a complex relation between @xmath28 and @xmath34 . in g14",
    ", the comparison of the values of @xmath28 for the two studied lens galaxies with those of sdss galaxies and dwarf spheroidals ( see the right panel of figure 10 in that paper ) seems to point to a consistent picture . despite that , with only a few lens galaxies modelled in detail , it is too early to draw any conclusion about the validity of this non - linear relation .",
    "we notice that cosmological hydrodynamical simulations do not have yet the spatial and mass resolutions needed to estimate reliably the projected luminous over total mass fraction within the half - light radii of cluster members comparable in size to g1 and g2 and residing in galaxy clusters as massive as macs j1115.9 + 0129 .",
    "interestingly , we remark that , on virial scales , the stellar - to - halo - mass relation reported in abundance matching studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) seems to show a similar dependence on stellar mass , with a maximum at approximately @xmath33 .    disparate studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) agree on finding that a salpeter - like stellar imf is the most suitable one for massive early - type galaxies . in the past few years",
    ", some observational evidence has also been collected in favour of a non - universal imf ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the work by @xcite supports a scenario with a non - universality of the low - mass end of the imf slope , which decreases with decreasing galaxy mass . clearly , in our analysis",
    ", it is fundamental to know whether a universal stellar imf is a reasonable assumption @xcite or whether we need to adopt a stellar imf which varies with the galaxy mass .",
    "regardless of the choice of the stellar imf to estimate the luminous mass of the galaxies studied in this paper , our results suggest that the total mass budget in the inner regions of g1 is dominated by the dark matter component . whether or not this is a characteristic of low - mass galaxies can not be definitively concluded until more studies on lens galaxies at the same low - mass scale are performed .",
    "strong lensing systems found in overdense environments are inherently more complicated to investigate , however our study shows that with multi - band imaging and spectroscopic data systematics can be controlled and galaxy - scale models are robust .",
    "these models can also be further constrained by independent measurements of the cluster total mass component .",
    "the study of such systems remains of great importance to extend our knowledge about the internal structure of galaxies at low - mass scales .",
    "this paper has presented the strong lensing analysis of a relatively rare system in which the main lens ( g1 ) is a low - mass , cluster member galaxy at @xmath35 which produces four images of a background source at @xmath36 .",
    "we have shown that an accurate lensing study requires to take into account the mass contributions of a companion cluster member ( g2 ) and of the galaxy cluster ( c ) . in order to extend our knowledge about the internal structure of galaxies to the low - mass end ,",
    "one possible way is to investigate more complex systems of this kind .",
    "the main results of this paper can be summarised in the following points :    * the model that best describes the strong lensing system is composed of two sies ( for the cluster members ) and a sis ( for the galaxy cluster ) , reproducing the observed positions of the multiple images within approximately 0.065 . *",
    "the total mass of g1 projected within its half - light radius is @xmath37 , independently of the modelling details . * the total mass of g2 projected within its half - light radius is @xmath38 from the best - fitting model .",
    "this quantity shows some degeneracy with the total mass assigned to the galaxy cluster component .",
    "* by fitting the seds of g1 and g2 with composite stellar population models and assuming a chabrier stellar imf , we have obtained that the stellar mass values of g1 and g2 are , respectively , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "* by combining the results of our lensing and photometric analyses , we have estimated that the projected luminous over total mass fractions of g1 and g2 are @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "previous strong lensing works have mainly focussed on high - mass lens galaxies in the field , due to the higher probability of being observed and to the specific selection criteria of the past surveys .",
    "more recently , some examples of low - mass lens galaxies ( @xmath43 ) , typically in overdense environments , have been detected and studied .",
    "the added complexity introduced in these environments requires detailed strong lensing analyses ( though limited by the small number of multiple images to only simple mass models ) , from which relevant information on all contributing mass components can be obtained .",
    "the combination of the available results on galaxy - scale strong lensing systems seems to show a variation in the inner luminous over total mass fraction with galaxy mass .",
    "the modelling of a larger sample of low - mass lens galaxies , thanks also to exquisite _ hst _ data collected within the clash and hubble frontier fields surveys , is a necessary step to help proving the robustness of these first results and , ultimately , clarifying the precise role played by dark matter in the galaxy mass assembly .",
