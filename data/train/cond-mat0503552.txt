    "recently considerable progress has been reached in understanding of an interplay between scattering effects and electron - electron interactions in low - dimensional disordered conductors . in particular , a profound relation @xcite between full counting statistics @xcite ( fcs ) and electron - electron interaction effects in mesoscopic conductors has been discovered and explored .",
    "this relation follows directly from the effective action of the system which can be conveniently derived by combining the scattering matrix technique with the path integral description of interactions @xcite .",
    "an important simplification of the formalism amounts to neglecting the energy independence of scattering matrix .",
    "this approximation is applicable to rather short coherent scatterers with thouless energy exceeding all other relevant energy scales . besides that",
    ", all inelastic processes are assumed to occur in large reservoirs but not inside the scatterer . for this model",
    "an exact expression for the effective action was derived @xcite and studied under various approximations , such as regular expansion @xcite of the action in powers of the `` quantum '' part of the fluctuating field describing interactions as well as renormalization group ( rg ) analysis @xcite .",
    "both approaches are justified in the metallic regime , i.e. provided the effective system conductance is much larger than the quantum unit @xmath0 .",
    "further generalizations of the model allowed to consider spatially extended metallic conductors and to describe inelastic processes inside the system @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to investigate the problem employing a different set of approximations in order to go beyond the regimes already studied in the literature . having in mind the relation between fcs and interaction effects in mesoscopic conductors , it would be useful to develop a straightforward and handy formalism enabling one to analyze the frequency dependence of higher order current correlation functions .",
    "in other words , the task at hand is to generalize the fcs - type of approach @xcite ( which is valid only in the low frequency limit ) to arbitrary frequencies .",
    "in addition , it is desirable to extent the description of interaction effects in mesoscopic coherent conductors beyond the metallic regime . this step would allow , for instance , for a more detailed analysis of electron - electron interactions effects in conductors with few conducting channels , such as , e.g. , single - wall carbon nanotubes and organic molecules",
    ".    here we will demonstrate that the above goals can be accomplished assuming transmissions @xmath1 of conducting channels to be either sufficiently small or , on the contrary , sufficiently close to unity . in these situations",
    "significant simplifications of the exact effective action can be worked out making the whole formalism more convenient for practical calculations .",
    "perhaps the most striking result of our analysis concerns the effect of electron - electron interactions on the shot noise in conductors with several highly transmitting channels .",
    "we will demonstrate that in this case coulomb interaction yields _ strong enhancement _ of the shot noise .",
    "specifically , at sufficiently small voltages @xmath2 the low frequency noise power spectrum @xmath3 in weakly reflecting scatterers takes the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dimensionless conductance of a scatterer .",
    "provided @xmath5 is not much bigger than 2 the result ( [ enh ] ) strongly exceeds the non - interacting dependence @xcite @xmath6 . in the limit of large voltages",
    "the noise spectrum is offset by the value of the coulomb gap , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the effective capacitance of the scatterer .",
    "we also note that interaction - induced excess noise in weakly reflecting scatterers is observed only at sufficiently low frequencies @xmath9 , while at larger @xmath10 coulomb interaction  on the contrary  suppresses the shot noise .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec . ii we will briefly summarize the main steps of our derivation of the exact effective action for the conductor described by an arbitrary energy independent scattering matrix",
    "this general expression will be analyzed in sec .",
    "iii in various limits .",
    "the limiting forms of the effective action will then be used to describe electron transport and current fluctuations in coherent conductors . in sec .",
    "iv we will use them to obtain the frequency and voltage dependence of current cumulants . in sec .",
    "v we will consider a scatterer shunted by a linear ohmic conductor and , assuming that the system conductance is sufficiently large , discuss perturbative logarithmic interaction corrections to the @xmath11 curve as well as their rg analysis . in sec .",
    "vi and vii we will go beyond the metallic limit and study the effect of electron - electron interactions respectively on the @xmath11 curve and on the shot noise of highly transmitting conductors .",
    "further extensions of our results for the case of quantum dots will be considered in sec .",
    "some formal manipulations and further details of our derivations are presented in appendices a , b and c.",
    "for our derivation we will make use of the keldysh path integral formalism describing the system of interacting electrons by the action which depends on the grassmann electron fields @xmath12 the labels 1 and 2 correspond to the forward and the backward branches of the keldysh contour and @xmath13 is the spin index .",
    "performing the standard hubbard - stratonovich decoupling of the coulomb interaction terms in the action , one introduces the two fluctuating electric potentials @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "afterwards the electron fields are integrated out and one arrives at a formally exact effective action @xmath16 here we assumed the spin degeneracy and defined @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the external static potential .",
    "the action ( [ action1 ] ) can also be expressed in a different way , which is convenient for generating correlation functions of the current : @xmath19 \\nonumber\\\\ + i\\int_0^t dt'\\int d^3\\bm{r } \\frac{(\\nabla v_1)^2-(\\nabla v_2)^2}{8\\pi } , \\label{action0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the trace taken over the fermionic variables . here",

    ".    one can also show ( see appendix a for details ) that the action ( [ action1 ] ) can be expressed in the following equivalent form @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the evolution operators . here",
    "we distinguish between the `` full '' trace ( `` @xmath27 '' , eq .",

    "( [ s1 ] ) are already well known and have been studied in details .",

    "it suffices to perform a regular expansion of the action ( [ s1 ] ) in powers of the field @xmath61",
    ". frequency dispersion of the third current cumulant was analyzed in this way in ref . .",
    "the same expansion allows to obtain valuable information about the effect of electron - electron interactions on transport properties , shot noise as well as higher cumulants of the current operator . assuming the dimensionless conductance of a scatterer @xmath5 and/or that of the external circuit @xmath63 are / is large",
    ", one can obtain the interaction correction to the current@xcite of order @xmath64 expanding the action ( [ s1 ] ) up to the second order in @xmath61 . in order to derive the interaction correction to the shot noise @xcite",
    "one should expand the action up to the third order in @xmath61 .",
    "finally , keeping the exact non - linear dependence of the action on the fields @xmath65 but expanding ( [ s1 ] ) to the first order in the transmission matrix @xmath66 , one immediately reproduces the well known aes effective action @xcite .",
    "the latter action , being combined with @xmath67 ( [ ss ] ) and the capacitance term , describes coulomb blockade effects in tunnel junctions embedded in a linear electromagnetic environment@xcite .    in what follows we will investigate the properties of the action ( [ s1 ] ) in some other limiting cases .",
    "let us first consider the case of weakly transmitting barriers and expand the action in powers of the matrix @xmath66 . as we have already pointed out , the first order terms of this expansion yield the aes effective action @xcite .",
    "here we proceed further and expand the action ( [ s1 ] ) up to @xmath68 keeping the complete nonlinear dependence on the fluctuating phases @xmath65 .",

    "one can also evaluate an effective action for reflectionless barriers directly without employing the bosonization technique .",
    "actually an important feature of the final result can be guessed even before doing the calculation .",
