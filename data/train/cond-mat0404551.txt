    "it is well known that there exists a strong competition between the kondo effect on each site of a kondo lattice and the magnetic ordering arising from the rkky interaction between magnetic atoms in heavy fermion systems .",
    "the doniach diagram@xcite gives a good description of this competition : the neel temperature @xmath3 is firstly increasing with an increasing of the antiferromagnetic s - f exchange interaction constant @xmath4 , then it is passing through a maximum and finally it tends to zero at the `` quantum critical point '' ( qcp ) , with a second order transition at zero temperature .",
    "such a decrease of @xmath3 down to the qcp has been observed in many cerium compounds , such as@xmath5@xcite or @xmath6@xcite , under pressure .",
    "we also know that the neel temperature starts from zero at a given pressure and incrases rapidly with pressure in ytterbium compounds , such as @xmath7@xcite or @xmath8@xcite , in good agreement with the doniach diagram . above the qcp , there exists a very strong heavy fermion character , but several possible behaviours , i.e. the classical fermi liquid one with eventually a reduced kondo temperature@xcite or different non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) ones , have been observed in cerium or ytterbium compounds@xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , the disorder can yield a spin glass ( sg ) phase in addition to the kondo ( mainly nfl ) behaviour at low temperatures around the qcp in disordered cerium or uranium alloys .",
    "this is the case of the magnetic phase diagram of @xmath9 alloys that has been extensively studied@xcite , while the phase diagram of @xmath10 alloys presents the sequence of sg - af - kondo phases at low temperatures with increasing cobalt concentration@xcite .",
    "the three phases , af , sg , and nfl have been obtained at low temperatures for different concentrations in @xmath11 @xcite or in @xmath12 @xcite disordered alloys .",
    "thus , a sg - kondo transition has been observed experimentally with increasing concentration in disordered alloys around the qcp .",
    "the purpose of our work here is to present a theoretical model that describes the qcp for the spin glass - kondo transition in kondo lattices.the sg - kondo transition was theoretically studied in a previous publication@xcite and also in the presence of ferromagnetic ordering@xcite or antiferromagnetic ordering@xcite , but the qcp was not described because we lacked a quantum mechanism that favored spin flipping .",
    "we present here an improvement of the previous model in order to obtain a good description of the qcp .",
    "more precisely , in previous publications@xcite the resultant rkky interaction was introduced by means of random , infinite range couplings among the @xmath13 components of the localized spins as in the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model@xcite and by neglecting the spin flip coupling of the transverse components . by using functional integral techniques with a static ansatz in a replica symmetric theory",
    ", we obtained a magnetic phase diagram in the @xmath14 plane , that showed the three different phases : paramagnetic , spin glass and kondo . in spite of its complication ,",
    "the model failed to describe a second order qcp at @xmath15 , because , by disregarding the spin flipping part of the heisenberg hamiltonian , we suppressed the tunneling mechanism , and magnetic ordering occurs only along the z - axis . in order to introduce a spin flipping mechanism and to avoid the intricacies of the random heisenberg model@xcite , in the present paper the heisenberg - like coupling among the three spin components induced by the rkky interaction",
    "is mimicked by a quantum ising spin glass in a transverse field .",
    "it consists in an effective random interaction among the z - components , as we considered in@xcite , while the spin flipping part is simulated by a uniform transverse field in the x - direction .",
    "the infinite range quantum ising spin glass in a transverse field @xmath0 is one of the simplest models that presents a quantum critical point and it is equivalent to the model for a spin glass of quantum rotors@xcite .",
    "the dynamical properties at zero temperature are known and the existence of the qcp is well established@xcite , while the phase diagram in the @xmath16 plane has been studied by using the trotter - suzuki technique@xcite , and more recently@xcite by the use of two fermionic representations of the spin operators in terms of grassmann fields@xcite that are more suitable to our purposes . as we did previously in reference@xcite , the kondo effect will be studied in an approximation that is basically equivalent to the mean field decoupling scheme @xcite .",
    "the static ansatz in the study of the spin glass transition is an approximation , similar to mean field theory , that is appropriate to describe the phase diagram .",
    "this is justified because in the model of m - components quantum rotors , that is exactly soluble for infinite m , the critical line is given by the singularity of the zero - frequency mode@xcite.the same occurs with the quantum ising spin glass in a transverse field@xcite , where the singularity of the zero frequency mode determines the critical point .",
    "that is the reason why the static ansatz , that describes only the zero frequency mode , describes the critical line in the phase diagram , although it would not give correctly the time dependence of the order parameter .",
    "a related hamiltonian has been considered in ref.@xcite to describe nfl behaviour and a qcp in some heavy fermion compounds , although there are essential differences between this work and ours in the present paper and in ref.@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is considered a system of isolated kondo impurities , each one with a separate electron reservoir , and represented by the spin glass model of m - components quantum rotors in the limit of large m , when the problem is exactly soluble .",
    "the kondo coupling provides the quantum mechanism and the transition line in the phase diagram is determined by the singularity of the zero frequency mode , displaying a qcp at zero temperature .",
    "the kondo effect is described there@xcite by isolated impurities and displays a continuous transition among different scaling regimes , in place of the sharp second order transition in kondo lattices@xcite    this paper is organized as follows : in sect.2 we introduce the model , in sect.3 we discuss relevant results and we reserve sect.4 for discussions and conclusion .",

    "we consider a kondo lattice system with localized spins @xmath17 at sites @xmath18 , coupled to the electrons of the conduction band via a s - f exchange interaction .",
    "it is necessary to introduce explicitly the resultant rkky interaction by means of a random , infinite range coupling among localized spins like in the sherrington kirkpatrick ( sk ) model for a spin glass@xcite . to describe the kondo effect in a mean - field - like theory it is sufficient to keep only the spin - flip terms @xcite in the exchange hamiltonian , while the spin glass interaction is represented by the quantum ising hamiltonian and the transverse field @xmath19 in the x - direction @xcite.the transverse field @xmath20 represents a simple quantum mechanism of spin flipping and mimics the more complicated transverse part of the heisenberg hamiltonian@xcite .",

    "a qcp has been observed experimentally in several cerium and uranium disordered alloys@xcite and the phase diagram shown in fig.1 which yields two qcp improves considerably the description of the spin glass - kondo transition with respect to previous publications@xcite .",

    "an unsolved basic question concerns also the existence or not of a `` mixed '' sg - kondo phase in cerium and uranium disordered alloys and this problem is worth of being studied experimentally in more detail .",
    "thus , further experimental work is necessary , but our model yields a new striking point in the behaviour of heavy fermion disordered alloys in the vicinity of the quantum critical point .",

    "<S> the kondo - spin glass competition is studied in a theoretical model of a kondo lattice with an intra - site kondo - type exchange interaction treated within the mean - field approximation , an inter - site quantum ising exchange interaction with random couplings among localized spins and an additional transverse field @xmath0 in the x - direction , which represents a simple quantum mechanism of spin flipping , in order to have a better description of the spin - glass state and in particular of the quantum critical point(qcp ) . </S>",
    "<S> taking here a parametrization @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the antiferromagnetic kondo coupling ) , we obtain two second order transition lines from the spin - glass state to the paramagnetic one and then to the kondo - state . </S>",
    "<S> for a reasonable set of the different parameters , the two second order transition lines do not intersect and end in two distinct qcp . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of qcp in the spin glass - kondo competition allows to give a better description of the phase diagrams of some cerium and uranium disordered alloys .    </S>",
