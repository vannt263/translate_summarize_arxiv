    "pion - pion scattering at threshold is uniquely sensitive to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking ( chsb ) part of the strong interaction . for this reason it has been the subject of much theoretical and experimental study for over thirty years .",
    "while qcd has removed the early controversies and established the weinberg picture@xcite of chsb as valid at the tree level , pion - pion scattering lengths , @xmath2 , remain of interest in terms of improving the precision of several basic parameters of the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "currently the most accurate predictions of @xmath2 come from chiral perturbation ( chpt ) calculations including terms up to two loops.@xcite however , a complementary approach , the generalized chiral perturbation theory@xcite ( gchpt ) dispenses with the standard assumption of a strong scalar quark condensate @xmath3 , allowing it to vary widely , with the conclusion that available experimental evidence favors a fairly weak condensate.@xcite the only observables capable of resolving this discrepancy are the @xmath0-@xmath0 s - wave scattering lengths , with a required precision of @xmath410% or better .",
    "the result generally regarded as most reliable among the available evaluations of @xmath5 was obtained in 1979 in a comprehensive phase shift analysis@xcite of peripheral @xmath6 reactions and @xmath7 decays : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the pion mass , clearly not precise enough to resolve the above quark condensate controversy .",
    "we therefore examine the more recent experiments and attempts at extraction of new , more precise values of @xmath2 .",
    "since free pion targets can not be fabricated , experimental evaluation of @xmath10 scattering observables is restricted to the study of a dipion system in a final state of more complicated reactions . while several reactions have been proposed and/or studied , only @xmath6 and @xmath11 decays",
    "have so far proven useful in studying threshold @xmath10 scattering , although there are ambitious plans to study @xmath12 atoms ( pionium ) in the near future .",
    "to    by most measures , the @xmath13 decay ( called @xmath7 ) provides the most suitable tool for the study of threshold @xmath10 interactions .",
    "the interacting pions are real and on the mass shell , the only hadrons in the final state .",
    "the dipion invariant mass distribution peaks close to the @xmath10 threshold , and only two states , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , contribute appreciably .",
    "these factors , plus the well understood @xmath16 weak lagrangian giving rise to the decay , favor the @xmath7 process among all others in terms of theoretical uncertainties .",
    "measurements are , however , impeded by the low branching ratio of the decay , @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath7 decay data provide information on the @xmath0-@xmath0 phase difference @xmath18 near threshold .",
    "the most recent published @xmath7 experimental result was obtained by a geneva  saclay collaboration in the mid-1970s.@xcite taken alone these data provide a @xmath19% constraint on @xmath20 . only after being combined with @xmath10 phase shifts extracted from peripheral @xmath6 reactions ( see below )",
    "is it possible to reduce the uncertainties to the level of about 20% , as quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nagels ] ) .",
    "we note that @xmath7 decays provide no information on the @xmath21 @xmath10 phase shifts , meaning that information from other reactions is required .",
    "to    goebel as well as chew and low showed in 1958/59 that particle production in peripheral collisions can be used to extract information on the scattering of two of the particles in the final state.@xcite this approach is , of course , useful primarily for the scattering of unstable particles and has been used to great advantage in the study of the @xmath10 system .",
    "the method relies on an accurate extrapolation of the double differential cross section to the pion pole , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the square of the 4-momentum transfer to the nucleon ) , in order to isolate the one pion exchange ( ope ) pole term contribution .",
    "since the exchanged pion is off - shell in the physical region ( @xmath24 ) , this method requires measurements under conditions that maximize the ope contribution and minimize all background contributions  typically peripheral pion production at values of @xmath23 as close to zero as possible , which is practical at incident momenta above @xmath43gev / c .",
    "since the clg method relies on extrapolation in a two - dimensional space , it requires kinematically complete data of high quality , both in terms of measurement statistics and resolution  main limiting factors in all analyses to date .",
    "the data base for peripheral clg analyses has not changed essentially since the early 1970 s , and is dominated by two experiments , performed by the berkeley@xcite and cern - munich@xcite groups .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of this data base , with addition of the geneva ",
    "saclay @xmath7 data , was performed by nagels et al.@xcite , with results given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nagels ] ) .",
    "a 1982 analysis by the kurchatov institute group was based on a set of some 35,000 @xmath6 events recorded in bubble chambers.@xcite this analysis was recently updated by including available data on the @xmath25 reaction , as well as the published @xmath7 data.@xcite the resulting s - wave @xmath10 scattering lengths were bounded by @xmath26 although the limits on @xmath20 carry slightly smaller uncertainties than the @xmath20 value of nagels et al .  given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nagels ] ) , the result of patarakin et al .  still can not rule out any of the two competing pictures of chiral symmetry breaking ( strong vs.  weak scalar quark condensate ) .",
    "the central value , though , is lower than in ( [ eq : nagels ] ) , more in line with the conventional , strong condensate picture that leads to the standard chpt two - loop prediction of @xmath27 .",
    "new high energy ( @xmath28gev ) peripheral @xmath6 measurements have not been planned for some time , so that much attention has been devoted to the study of the @xmath6 reaction at lower energies , @xmath29mev , as discussed below .",
    "to    weinberg showed early on@xcite that the ope graph dominates the @xmath1 reaction at threshold , inspiring vigorous theoretical and experimental study of the @xmath10 and @xmath6 threshold amplitudes .",
    "results of near - threshold @xmath30 studies published before 1995 are reviewed in detail in ref.@xcite ) . that impressive data base has been augmented by the addition of new , more precise @xmath31 cross sections very near threshold from triumf.@xcite",
    "the new measurements have confirmed the same group s earlier published data@xcite on the @xmath32 reaction , thus definitively invalidating older data taken by the omicron collaboration at cern.@xcite    notwithstanding the abundance and high accuracy of recent near - threshold inclusive pion production data , their interpretation in terms of @xmath10 amplitudes has been plagued by theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this shortcoming was addressed in 1995 using the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory@xcite ( hbchpt ) , yielding : @xmath33 the above result for @xmath20 was subsequently refined by olsson who used the so - called universal curve , a model - independent relation between @xmath20 and @xmath34 due to the forward dispersion relation or , equivalently , to the roy equations.@xcite olsson found @xmath35 any analysis based on hbchpt can not , however , be expected to result in @xmath10 scattering lengths significantly different from the standard chpt prediction because the latter is built into the lagrangian used .    to    given the theoretical uncertainties in the interpretation of inclusive @xmath1 data near threshold ,",
    "it was suggested some time ago to apply the chew  low method to low energy @xmath6 data.@xcite recently several exclusive @xmath6 data sets suitable for such treatment have become available .",
    "these are , in the order in which they were measured : + ( a ) @xmath36 data from bnl@xcite , + ( b ) @xmath37 data from lampf@xcite , and + ( c ) @xmath38 data from triumf@xcite .",
    "+ we next briefly review the current results of these experiments .",
    "a virginia  stanford  lampf team studied the @xmath37 reaction at lampf at five energies from 190 to 260mev.@xcite the lampf @xmath39 spectrometer and an array of plastic scintillation telescopes were used for @xmath40 and @xmath41 detection .",
    "three classes of exclusive events were recorded simultaneously and independently : @xmath42 and @xmath43 double coincidences , and @xmath44 triple coincidences . the @xmath37 reaction is sensitive only to the @xmath21 s - wave @xmath10 scattering length .",
    "the main source of difficulty in this analysis was the relatively broad missing mass resolution : @xmath45 mev and @xmath46 mev .",
    "this energy resolution considerably smears the cross section data bins in a chew ",
    "low plot of @xmath47 against @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , in order to obtain a physically interpretable array of double differential cross section bins , a complicated deconvolution procedure had to be implemented first.@xcite limited counting statistics presented an additional difficulty in the analysis , as it increased the uncertainties in both the deconvolution procedure and in the final clg extrapolation .",
    "preliminary results of this analysis for one bin of @xmath48 are shown in fig.[fig : chew - low : e1179 ] .",
    "open circles in the figure indicate data points excluded from the chew  low extrapolation procedure due to large values of @xmath49 , where ope is weak , and the smallest @xmath50 point which has a large normalization uncertainty due to the cross section deconvolution procedure . the resulting @xmath10 cross section is @xmath51 mb , which translates to a phase shift of @xmath52 .",
    "this does not provide a strong new constraint when compared with existing information .    in comparison , the bnl @xmath36 data ,",
    "while having much higher event statistics , are characterized by an even broader energy resolution and poorer coverage of the low @xmath50 region critical for the chew ",
    "low extrapolation .",
    "this limitation and/or strong influence of non - ope backgrounds led to nonphysical results ( negative extrapolated cross sections ) , as shown in fig.[fig : chew - low : e857 ] .",
    "the most significant development in this field in recent years has been the construction and operation of the canadian high acceptance orbit spectrometer ( chaos ) , a sophisticated new detector at triumf.@xcite this impressive device , composed of a number of concentric cylindrical wire chamber tracking detectors and total energy counters mounted between the poles of a large bending magnet , provides nearly 360@xmath53 of angular coverage for in - plane events , with excellent acceptance for multi - particle events .",
    "the chaos @xmath54 data set covers four incident beam energies between 223 and 284mev . unlike the lampf and bnl measurements ,",
    "these data have an excellent energy resolution of @xmath55mev , resulting in good linear chew  low extrapolations , as shown in fig.[fig : chew - low : chaos ] .    from the clg",
    "fits the authors extracted @xmath10 cross sections at six @xmath10 energies in the range @xmath565.65@xmath57 with uncertainties ranging from about 16% at the lowest energy to 63% at the highest .",
    "these @xmath10 cross section data were then added to the data base of ref.@xcite ) , and a roy equation constrained phase shift analysis was performed following the same procedure as in ref.@xcite ) , allowing @xmath20 to vary freely . minimizing the @xmath58 of the fit , the authors obtained @xmath59 which would strongly confirm the validity of the standard chpt and the strong scalar quark condensate implied therein , at the same time ruling out the possibility of the weak scalar quark condensate proposed by the orsay group.@xcite    however , bolokhov et al .  of the sankt petersburg state university",
    "have recently performed a detailed study of the reliability of the chew ",
    "low method at low energies using sets of synthetic @xmath6 `` data '' between 300 and 500 mev / c.@xcite in this work the authors constructed data sets with : ( a ) the ope contribution only , ( b ) ope + other allowed mechanisms , ( c ) all mechanisms without the ope .",
    "both linear and quadratic chew ",
    "low extrapolation were used .",
    "the authors found 2535% deviations in the reconstructed ope strength in case ( a ) , 100300% deviations under ( b ) , and large `` ope amplitude '' without any pion pole in the synthetic data under ( c ) .",
    "this led the authors to conclude that the chew ",
    "low method appears to give completely unreliable results .",
    "however , given the complex nature of the issue , it would be premature to write off using the method at low energies altogether .",
    "clearly , a critical examination of the problem is imperative . in the meantime , before the matter is finally resolved , we can not accept the chaos result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chaos_res ] ) as definitive .",
    "theoretical predictions and experimental results on the @xmath10 scattering lengths published to date are plotted in fig.[fig : univ_plot ] in the @xmath34 against @xmath20 plane .",
    "it is clear that the current analyses of the available @xmath7 and @xmath1 data ( excluding the not yet fully established low energy application of the chew ",
    "low method ) are not sufficiently accurate to distinguish between the two scenarios of chiral symmetry breaking , i.e. , between the standard picture and the one with a weak @xmath60 .",
    "the threshold @xmath0-@xmath0 scattering experimental data base will improve significantly in the near future as several new experiments bear fruit .",
    "these are : ( a ) the forthcoming @xmath7 data from bnl e865 ( experiment completed , analysis in progress ) and the kloe detector at da@xmath62ne ( experiment to start soon ) , as well as ( b ) the planned measurement of the lifetime of the @xmath12 atom ( the dirac project at cern ) .",
    "if all goes as planned , these experiments combined will provide @xmath45% limits on the scattering lengths .",
    "as noted above , further theoretical work is required to make use of the existing @xmath6 data , in particular to clarify the applicability of the chew  low",
    " goebel method at low energies",
    ". additionally , better understanding of the electromagnetic corrections will be necessary in order to take full advantage of the forthcoming @xmath63 and pionium data .",
    "thus , the next few years will be interesting on both the experimental and theoretical fronts .",
    "the author wishes to thank a. a. bolokhov , e. frle , o. o. patarakin , m. e. sevior and g. r. smith for substantive discussions and for graciously providing access to results of their ongoing work .",
