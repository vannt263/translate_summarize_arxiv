    "in traditional wireless sensor networks , sensor nodes are often powered by non - rechargeable batteries and distributed over a large area for data aggregation .",
    "but a major limitation of these untethered sensors is that the network lifetime is often dominated by finite battery capacity .",
    "since the battery charge depletes with time , periodic battery or node replacement is required for prolonging the sensor node operations , though it becomes infeasible , costly and even impossible in some environments such as a large - scale network . as a result",
    ", there has been much research on designing efficient transmission mechanisms / protocols for saving energy in sensor communications @xcite .",
    "recently , energy harvesting has become an attractive alternative to circumvent this energy exhaustion problem by scavenging ambient energy sources ( e.g. , solar , wind , vibration , etc . ) to replenish the sensors power supply @xcite .",
    "though an inexhaustible energy supply from the environments enables wireless sensor nodes to function for a potentially infinite lifetime , management of the harvested energy remains a crucial issue due to the uncertainty of battery replenishment .",
    "in fact , most ambient sources occur randomly and sporadically in nature , and different sources exhibit different energy renewal processes in terms of predictability , controllability , and magnitude , requiring various design considerations for energy management .    in this paper , we focus on solar - powered wireless sensor networks , where each node is equipped with an energy harvesting device and a solar panel to collect surplus energy through the photovoltaic effect .",
    "since the solar energy is uncontrollable and the rate of energy generation is typically small , the energy is temporarily stored and accumulated up to a certain amount in the rechargeable battery , which has limited storage capacity , for future data transmissions .",
    "but in practice , the amount of energy quanta available to a sensor could fluctuate dramatically even within a short period , and the level depends on many factors , such as the time of the day , the current weather , the seasonal weather patterns , the physical conditions of the environments around sensors , and the timescale ( from seconds to days ) of the energy management , to name but a few .",
    "this makes the prediction of energy harvesting conditions for the future intervals very challenging , even though the solar irradiance is partially predictable with the aid of daily irradiance patterns @xcite .",
    "hence , there is a need for a stochastic energy harvesting model specific to each node , which is capable of capturing the dynamics of the solar energy associated with real data records .",
    "besides , overly aggressive or conservative use of the harvested energy may either run out of the energy in the battery or fail to utilize the excess energy , resulting in the so - called energy outage or energy overflow problems , respectively .",
    "consequently , another essential challenge lies in adaptively tuning the transmission parameters of sensor nodes in a smooth way that considers the randomness of energy generation and channel variation , avoids early energy depletion before the next management cycle , and maximizes certain utility functions through a finite or infinite horizon of epochs .    a wide variety of energy generation models have been adopted in the literature to study the performance of solar - powered sensor networks .",
    "in general , energy harvesting models can be categorized into two classes : deterministic models @xcite , @xcite and stochastic models @xcite , @xcite@xcite . deterministic models , which assume that energy arrival instants and amounts are known in advance by the transmitter , were applied in @xcite and @xcite for designing transmission schemes .",
    "the success of the energy management in this category rests on an assumption of accurate energy harvesting prediction over a somewhat long time horizon , whereas modeling mismatch occurs when the prediction interval is enlarged .",
    "recently attention has shifted to stochastic models by accommodating the design of energy management to the randomness of energy renewal processes .",
    "the authors of @xcite developed an analytic solar radiation process with the parameters of cloud size and wind speed . by assuming that energy harvested in each time slot is identically and independently distributed ,",
    "the energy generation process has been described via bernoulli models with a fixed harvesting rate @xcite@xcite .",
    "other commonly used stochastic models that are uncorrelated across time include the uniform process @xcite , poisson process @xcite , and exponential process @xcite . in some previous works ,",
    "energy from ambient sources was modeled by a two - state markov model to mimic the time - correlated harvesting behavior of a sensor node with time - slotted operation @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , there has been little research to validate the assumptions , along with exact physical interpretation , of the aforementioned stochastic models .",
    "it is essential to incorporate a data - driven stochastic model , which is capable of linking its underlying parameters to the dynamics of empirical energy harvesting data , into the design of sensor communications in order to develop more realistic performance characteristics .",
    "resource management for energy harvesting communications has been reported in the literature to optimize the system utility and to harmonize the energy consumption with the battery recharge rate .",
    "the optimization of energy usage is subject to a neutral constraint which stipulates that at each time instant , the energy expenditure can not surpass the total amount of energy harvested so far .",
    "the utilities considered in previous works include the data throughput in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite , the data queuing delay in @xcite , the packet error rate in @xcite , @xcite , the transmission outage probability in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the importance value of data packets in @xcite , @xcite . with deterministic energy and channel profiles ,",
    "a utility maximization framework was investigated in @xcite to achieve smooth energy spending for a node . applying a save - then - transmit protocol , the authors of @xcite investigated a save - time ratio selection problem to maximize data throughput . in @xcite , power and rate adaption",
    "were jointly designed for maximizing data throughput via an upper bound that is solely subject to an average power constraint .",
    "directional water - filling was proposed in @xcite for throughput maximization . with stochastic models ,",
    "the authors of @xcite designed a threshold to decide whether to transmit or drop a message based on its importance .",
    "the outage probabilities of an energy harvesting node were analyzed in fading channels by taking into account both the energy harvesting and event arrival processes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a simple power control policy was developed in @xcite to attain near optimal throughput in a finite - horizon case .",
    "more recently , markov decision processes ( mdp ) have been utilized to deal with the resource management problems for energy harvesting systems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "when the battery replenishment , the wireless channel , and the packet arrival are regarded as markov processes , sleep and wake - up strategies were developed in solar - powered sensor networks @xcite .",
    "similar investigations were carried out with different reward functions , e.g. , buffer delay @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "transmission strategies for applications in body sensor networks and active networked tags were solved by casting them as mdp problems . in the presence of partial state information at transmitters ,",
    "the problems of transmission scheduling and power control were addressed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , by means of partially observable mdp . however , the aforementioned works all prearranged stochastic energy generation models for the development of transmission mechanisms without concern for the reality of the assumptions underlying the considered models .",
    "further , none of these works linked the solar irradiance data , gathered by an energy harvesting node , to the constructions of the design frameworks and the optimal transmission policies .    in this paper , we present data - driven transmission policies for an energy harvesting source node that aims to transmit information packets to its sink over a wireless fading channel .",
    "for this we maximize the long - term bit rates of the communication link by adapting transmission power levels and modulation schemes to the source s knowledge of its current battery and channel status .",
    "we employ a gaussian mixture hidden markov model to quantify energy harvesting conditions into several representative solar states , whereby the underlying parameters enable us to effectively describe the statistical properties of the solar irradiance . to extract the underlying parameters , we use the learning ability of expectation - maximization ( em ) algorithms to fit the hidden markov model to the historical data record . through the discretization ,",
    "a stochastic discrete model that describes the generation of energy quanta is developed and integrated into our design frameworks to capture the interaction between the underlying parameters and the system parameters .",
    "the fading channel between the source and the sink is represented by a finite - state markov model .",
    "the adaptive transmission problem is then formulated as a discounted mdp and solved by a value iteration algorithm .",
    "both the energy wastage and the throughput degradation caused by data packet retransmission are taken into consideration when the average reward rate is maximized .",
    "since the exact solar state is unknown to the energy harvesting sensor , an observation - based mixed strategy is developed to compute the belief state information and to decide the corresponding transmission parameters , based on the present measurement of the solar irradiance .",
    "in addition , we present a theoretical study on a simple on - off transmission policy to obtain more insight into our design framework .",
    "that means packets are transmitted at constant power and modulation levels if the action is  on \" , while no transmission occurs if the action is  off \" . in this special case , there exists a threshold structure in the direction along the battery states , and the long - term expected bit rate is increased with the amount of energy quanta in the battery . throughout this paper , a real data record of the solar irradiance measured by a solar site in elizabeth city state university @xcite",
    "is utilized to exemplify our design framework as well as its performance evaluation .",
    "the performance of the proposed transmission policies is validated by extensive computer simulations and compared with other radical policies with or without the knowledge of short - range energy harvesting and channel variation patterns .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the stochastic energy harvesting model , the training of its underlying parameters , and its connection to the real data record . the mdp formulation of the adaptive transmission is presented in section iii , followed by the optimization of the policies and the mixed strategy in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to the analysis of the threshold structure for a simple on - off transmission policy .",
    "simulation results are presented in section vi , and concluding remarks are provided in section vii .",
    "the model for describing the harvested energy depends on various parameters , such as weather conditions ( e.g. , sunny , cloudy , rainy ) , sunshine duration ( e.g , day and night ) , and behavior of the rechargeable battery ( e.g. , storage capacity ) .",
    "besides , the solar energy usually evolves in a smooth fashion over a short time period .",
    "we focus on modeling the solar power from the measurements by using a hidden markov chain , and establish a framework to extract the underlying parameters that can characterize the availability of solar power .",
    "we begin with a toy example to justify the rationality of the proposed energy harvesting models .",
    "consider a real data record of irradiance ( i.e. , the intensity of the solar radiation in units @xmath0w/@xmath1 ) for the month of june from 2008 to 2010 , measured by a solar site in elizabeth city state university , with the measurements taken at five - minute intervals @xcite . in fig .",

    "we can make the following observations from this figure .",
    "first , the daily solar radiation fluctuates slowly within a short time interval , but could suddenly change from the current level to adjacent levels with higher or lower mean values .",
    "second , the average irradiance value is sufficiently high only from the early morning ( seven oclock ) to the late afternoon ( seventeen oclock ) .",
    "we refer to this time duration as the sunlight active region .",
    "third , the evolution of the diurnal irradiance follows a very similar time - symmetric mask , whereas the short - term profiles of different days can be very different and unpredictable . by considering the irradiance from seven oclock to seventeen oclock for june in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , fig .",
    "[ histogram_irradiance ] shows the corresponding histogram plotted against the irradiance on the x - axis , which represents the percentage of the occurrences of data samples in each bin of width @xmath3 @xmath0w/@xmath1 .",
    "it can be seen that the irradiance behaves like a mixture random variable generated by a number of normal distributions .",
    "in fact , the solar radiation incident on an energy harvesting device is affected by its surrounding obstacles ( e.g. , cloud and terrain ) , which yield absorption , reflection and scattering phenomena , and it can be intuitively presented as a gaussian random variable by the law of large numbers .",
    "these observations motivate us to describe the evolution of the irradiance via a hidden markov chain with a finite number of possible states , each of which is specified by a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance .",

    "for instance , the performance with @xmath369 at @xmath370 db , @xmath371 @xmath1 and @xmath345 is about @xmath372 bits / sec , probably @xmath373 times that being achieved by the same policy with @xmath374 .",
    "obviously , the energy harvesting sensor node additionally benefits from channel diversity gains if the energy spending is carefully governed to respond to the change in channel conditions .",
    "furthermore , the bit rate becomes better as the doppler frequency and the solar panel area increase , and the improvement owing to the increase in the number of battery states is relatively modest for lower doppler frequencies .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the problem of maximizing long - term net bit rates in sensor communication that solely relies on solar energy for data transmission .",
    "a node - specific energy harvesting model was developed to classify the harvesting conditions into several solar states with different energy quantum arrivals . unlike previous works , which were not concerned with the real - world energy harvesting capability , a data - driven mdp framework was formulated to obtain the optimal transmission parameters from a set of power and modulation actions in response to the dynamics of channel fading and battery storage .",
    "since different nodes may possess different energy harvesting capabilities , the parameters of the underlying energy harvesting process were completely determined by the solar irradiance observed at a sensor node . in practice ,",
    "the exact solar state at each time epoch is unavailable , and a mixed strategy was proposed to associate the adaptive transmission parameters with the beliefs of the solar states .",
    "the validity of the proposed data - driven approach was rigorously justified by the real data of solar irradiance .",
    "we also analyzed the properties and the net bit rates of the optimal on - off transmission policy , and it was proved that this policy has an inherent threshold structure in the direction along the battery states . through extensive computer simulations , the proposed data - driven approach was shown to achieve significant gains with respect to other radical approaches , while it did not require non - causal knowledge of energy harvesting and channel fading patterns .",

    "<S> energy harvesting from the surroundings is a promising solution to perpetually power - up wireless sensor communications . </S>",

    "<S> we formulate this problem as a discounted markov decision process ( mdp ) framework , whereby the energy harvesting process is stochastically quantized into several representative solar states with distinct energy arrivals and is totally driven by historical data records at a sensor node . with the observed solar irradiance at each time epoch , a mixed strategy is developed to compute the belief information of the underlying solar states for the choice of transmission parameters . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , a theoretical analysis is conducted for a simple on - off policy , in which a predetermined transmission parameter is utilized whenever a sensor node is active . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that such an optimal policy has a threshold structure with respect to battery states and evaluate the performance of an energy harvesting node by analyzing the expected net bit rate . </S>",
    "<S> the design framework is exemplified with real solar data records , and the results are useful in characterizing the interplay that occurs between energy harvesting and expenditure under various system configurations . </S>",
    "<S> computer simulations show that the proposed policies significantly outperform other schemes with or without the knowledge of short - term energy harvesting and channel fading patterns . </S>"
