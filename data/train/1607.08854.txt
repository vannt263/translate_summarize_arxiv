    "inflation in the early universe is well described by the general class of @xmath0-attractor models .",
    "these can be constructed in supergravity as f - term models @xcite or as d - term models @xcite , where the first @xmath0-dependent generalization of the starobinsky potential was introduced .",
    "a robust feature of these models is the spectral index @xmath8 , which is in perfect agreement with the observed value of @xmath1 for the number of @xmath9-foldings @xmath10 , as one can see in fig .",
    "12 in @xcite .",
    "the level of gravity waves in @xmath0-attractors is given by @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 at @xmath13 .",
    "it is directly related to the curvature of the moduli space @xmath14 which in @xmath15 supergravity is a free parameter @xcite . from the current planck - bicep - keck constraint @xmath16",
    "@xcite it follows that @xmath17 .",
    "future b - mode experiments will constrain this parameter further . more precise constraints on @xmath0 depend on the details of the models and on the mechanism of reheating ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "inflation in supergravity is often described using two chiral superfields , the inflaton @xmath18 and the stabilizer @xmath19 , as first suggested in @xcite for quadratic chaotic inflation , and developed for a general class of models in @xcite .",
    "there are 4 real scalar fields in these models , one of which is the relatively light inflaton and 3 others vanish during inflation .",
    "sneutrino inflation @xcite refers to an extension of this model with the neutrino sector , such that the fermions in the inflaton and stabilizer superfields provide the right - handed partners to the standard model neutrinos .",
    "then one generates light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the interesting observation here is that in large field models of inflation the inflaton mass is of order @xmath20 gev , which is close to the right - handed neutrino mass scale suggested by the seesaw mechanism and the neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "explicitly , the left handed neutrino masses come from integrating out the heavy fermions with mass @xmath21 from the inflationary sector , so that m_light^~v^2 m ~10 ^ 410 ^ 13  gev ~   ev , where @xmath22 is the higgs vev .",
    "the left - handed neutrinos are many orders of magnitude lighter than all the other particles in the standard model and the seesaw mechanism is the only known way to explain this , but it does not give a reason for the existence of the heavy fermions .",
    "inflation seems to naturally supply these heavy fields at the right scale . in particular , the general supergravity constructions @xcite necessarily involve two superfields ( the inflaton and the stabilizer fields ) and thus provide two right - handed neutrinos , allowing for two massive and one massless neutrino .",
    "the most recent model of sneutrino inflation was proposed in @xcite , based on multi - natural models of inflation@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to point out advantages of implementing sneutrino inflation into inflationary @xmath0-attractor models , comparative to the model in @xcite .",
    "note that the simple natural inflationary model with a single frequency is disfavored by the recent planck data @xcite .",
    "the generalization to two fourier terms in supergravity with the inflaton @xmath18 and stabilizer field @xmath19 was first proposed in @xcite with the superpotential @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to a generalization of the natural inflation potential when all 3 extra scalar fields are stabilized and only the inflaton is light .",
    "the supergravity versions of the multi - natural inflation models in @xcite involve two axion superfields instead , without the stabilizer superfield .",
    "the lighter axion field plays the role of the inflaton .",
    "the supergravity models of sneutrino inflation proposed in @xcite have a superpotential of the type studied in @xcite w= m s _",
    "n g_n n f .",
    "however , it was observed in @xcite that this model requires the second frequency term with complex coefficient @xmath24 in the superpotential , to fit the data .",
    "models with complex parameters in the superpotential are somewhat complicated , as shown in @xcite",
    ". to fit the future data on @xmath1 and especially @xmath2 will require a choice of @xmath25 parameters .",
    "this is certainly possible but will become more difficult when the bound on @xmath2 will decrease further , as one can see from fig . 2 in @xcite where various numerical examples are plotted .    the important feature of the ( multi-)natural inflation models which allows them to be used for sneutrino inflation is the unbroken discrete shift symmetry @xmath26 .",
    "this symmetry allows one to keep the inflationary predictions intact when 4 additional superfields , 3 leptons @xmath27 , @xmath28 and the higgs @xmath29 are added to the model via the following superpotential @xcite w= p_a l^a h^u _",
    "n g_n n f . this is invariant under @xmath26 , thus even at large @xmath30 the masses of the lepton and higgs supermultiplets are not blowing up since @xmath31 is restricted for any value of @xmath30 .",
    "however , the @xmath0-attractor models do not have an unbroken discrete shift symmetry ; they have instead a symmetry associated with the hyperbolic geometry .",
    "will these models provide a framework for sneutrino inflation models ?",
    "the answer to this question is positive , as we will argue below .    in hyperbolic @xmath0-attractor models , the leptons and the higgs field",
    "interact with the disk variable @xmath32 . in the simplest case we have w = p_a l^a h^u z = p_a l^a h^u , analogous to a single fourier term in multi - natural inflation .",
    "inflation occurs when @xmath33 is very close to the boundary of the moduli space at @xmath34 , which corresponds to @xmath35 in terms of the canonically normalized inflaton field @xmath36re@xmath37 . for a  potential that describes hyperbolic geometry supplemented with a generic superpotential that is non - singular at the boundary of the moduli space",
    ", the inflaton potential @xmath38 becomes flat . in this limit , the masses of all particles at large values of the inflaton field @xmath30 approach exponentially fast their constant values corresponding to the limit @xmath39 or @xmath40 , and all coupling constants of the field @xmath30 to the matter fields become exponentially small in the limit @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "thus the hyperbolic geometry of @xmath0-attractors protects the masses of leptons and higgs fields during inflation , and suggests inflationary models which are more flexible with regard to future data and have an elegant geometric interpretation . instead of periodic functions of the inflaton @xmath42 interacting with matter multiplets , we have a natural geometric variable of the moduli space with a boundary , the coordinate of the poincar disk @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "an interpretation of this moduli space in terms of escher s picture circle limit iv was proposed in @xcite , where it was shown that the radius square of this disk is given by @xmath45 .",
    "thus the trigonometric restriction on couplings to matter is replaced by the hyperbolic one : 1 z|z < 1 , while the role of the axion decay constant @xmath46 is played by the curvature parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we will provide a review of @xmath0-attractor models .",
    "these will be coupled to the neutrino sector in section 3 .",
    "the stability during and after inflation and the role of tachyonic directions is discussed in section 4 .",
    "we close with a discussion and present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the key aspect of @xmath0-attractors is their hyperbolic geometry for the moduli space spanned by the scalar fields .",
    "this hyperbolic geometry is often parametrized as the poincar half - plane or disk .",
    "we will focus on the latter formulation in this paper . in the disk variables our models are , @xmath47 . ]",
    "k= -32 + s|s ,",
    "w= a(z ) + s b(z ) , [ kdisknew]with the superpotential containing two arbitrary but real holomorphic functions . is a holomorphic function such that @xmath48 . ]",
    "the khler metric for these models reads k_z|z = . during inflation",
    "we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 so that the inflaton is @xmath51 , and k=0 , k_z=0 . for our purpose of providing a pair of heavy fermions from inflationary multiplets , we will not use constrained superfields , but just assume that we can add some stabilizing features @xcite to our potential .",
    "for example , we can add terms like @xmath52 and @xmath53 leading to sectional and bisectional curvatures which stabilize the 3 scalars other than re@xmath54 , so that only the inflaton is relatively light . the potential during inflation",
    "is given by v= 13 a(z)^2 ( 1-z^2)^2 + b(z)^2 -3 a(z)^2 , evaluated along the real part of @xmath33 .",
    "an alternative parametrization of the hyperbolic geometry is in terms of the killing coordinates = + i , z= , t= e^ .",
    "this change of variables leads to k= -3 [ ] + s |s , and the superpotential becomes w= a ( ) + s b ( ) g()+ s f ( ) , where @xmath46 and @xmath55 are arbitrary real holomorphic functions .",
    "the metric is conformally flat for all parametrizations ds^2=",
    "3= 3= |2 ^2((- | ) / ) .",
    "the special feature of the killing coordinates is that the metric is independent of the inflation ( which is the real component in all cases ) ; indeed , along @xmath56 , the metric for the inflaton is canonical .",
    "finally , the corresponding scalar potential takes the particularly simple form v_total= 2 g()^2 - 3 g()^2 + f()^2 . for all choices of moduli space coordinates above , both the potential and its first derivative vanish during inflation , making the covariant derivatives identical to simple derivatives @xmath57 , @xmath58 . in the case of killing coordinates ,",
    "the additional simplification is that the inflaton s inverse kinetic term is simple , @xmath59 . by a proper choice of the model",
    ", one can achieve a desirable value for the cosmological constant and the susy breaking scale .",
    "this can be done in a most natural way using the theory of constrained superfields , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of a model based on hyperbolic geometry , analogous to the first supergravity model for quadratic inflation with a flat geometry @xcite , is given by w= m s z v= m^2z^2 = m^2 ^2 ( )  . [ kdisknew2]during inflation , which takes place close to the boundary @xmath60 ,",
    "the potential is very close to the plateau @xmath61 and the hubble constant is given by @xmath62 .",
    "a proper cobe - planck normalization of the scalar perturbations is achieved by the choice @xcite m ~10",
    "instead , near the minimum of the inflaton potential at @xmath63 ( i.e for @xmath64 ) , the scalar potential reduces to @xmath65 .",
    "the mass of the inflaton field is then given by @xmath66 .",
    "an investigation of this model during inflation in the slow - roll approximation yields the following field values at the moment when the universe was @xmath67 e - foldings away from the end of inflation : _",
    "n = , z_n = [ 12 ]  .",
    "note that @xmath68 approaches @xmath69 , the boundary of the disk , in the limit @xmath70 . for future reference we will give here some numerical results for the simplest case @xmath71 : @xmath72 we will return to these numerical values later , since the effective masses of all other fields during and after inflation will be directly related to the field @xmath33 .",
    "it should be noted that the field values quoted at small @xmath67 are not very precise because of the failure of the slow - roll approximation at the end of inflation and also because there are several slightly inequivalent definitions of the `` end of inflation '' .",
    "one popular definition is that it is the moment when one of the slow roll parameters becomes equal to @xmath69 , yet another one is that the end of inflation is the moment when the universe no longer accelerates .",
    "using this last definition and solving the equations without using the slow - roll approximation gives the value of the field @xmath33 at the end of inflation @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , all field values quoted here are model - dependent : in contrast to the inflationary predictions around @xmath74 , where the specific choice of the functions in the superpotential only affects subleading effects in @xmath75 , the behaviour for small values of @xmath67 can differ significantly between models .",
    "the next step is to add to the model ( [ kdisknew ] ) the and superpotential for the mssm fields .",
    "the rh neutrinos are the fermions in the @xmath33 and @xmath76 multiplets .",
    "in addition to the inflationary part , the superpotential has some terms where the leptons and higgs multiplets interact with the inflationary sector , k&= & -32 + s|s + _",
    "l^a |l^|a + h^u |h^u , w&= & a(z)+ s b(z ) + ( p_a z + q_a s ) l^a h^u .",
    "[ khalfnew ] there are 6 complex parameters",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath28 which serve to build the light neutrino mass matrix upon integrating out the rh neutrinos",
    ".    recently the generic coupling of models of inflation to a matter sector was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the criteria spelled out there , that in particular lead to the absence of tachyons in the matter sector during and after inflation , are not satisfied for the generic model in eqn . .",
    "this means that generically one expects that some of the matter fields become tachyonic at a certain stage of the inflationary evolution , which is indeed the case as we will see below .",
    "since we can not rely on generic criteria that ensure the stability of the matter fields , we have to do an explicit analysis of the full model given in eqn . .",
    "in order to do so let us note some important points about models of the form given in eqn . , which follow from explicit calculations as carried out for example in @xcite : there is a critical point for the matter fields at @xmath79 and at this critical point the matter sector does not affect the inflationary sector at all since mixed derivatives of the potential involving @xmath33 or @xmath19 and one of the matter fields @xmath27 or @xmath29 vanish .",
    "we thus can focus on the mass matrix for the matter fields at this critical point during and after inflation .    in the standard model , @xmath27 and @xmath29 are electro - weak @xmath80 doublets , while @xmath81 is the invariant inner product .",
    "however , for the above and superpotential one finds that the @xmath82 matter sector mass matrix at @xmath79 , which will be satisfied during inflation , factorizes into two identical @xmath83 blocks that involve either only first or only second components of both doublets .",
    "so there is no mixing between both components and they have the same @xmath84 mass matrix .",
    "this @xmath85 mass matrix can be simply obtained by treating @xmath27 and @xmath29 effectively as @xmath80 singlets , which is what we are going to do in this section .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that they are doublets and that the full @xmath86 mass matrix only factorizes into two decoupled and identical @xmath85 blocks if @xmath79 .    in order to calculate this mass matrix for the four complex fields @xmath27 and @xmath29 it is useful to first take advantage of the symmetries of our model .",
    "the potential part @xmath87 is invariant under @xmath88 transformations acting on the @xmath89 index .",
    "this allows us to rotate rotations that we perform as a change of basis for the chiral fields @xmath27 .",
    "such a change of basis is of course unavoidable , if we want to diagonalize the mass matrix . ]",
    "l^a _ b l^b , p_a p_a u^a_b = (    c p + 0 + 0    ) .",
    "furthermore , we have enough freedom left in @xmath90 to also take q_a q_a u^a_b = (    c q_1 + q_2 + 0    ) , with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the mass matrix for the matter fields @xmath93 at the critical point @xmath79 during inflation then takes the form ^2 = ( v+|a|^2 ) + (    cccccccc p^2 |z|^2 & 0&0&0 & 0&0&0 & c_1 + 0&0&0&0&0&0&0&c_2 + 0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0 + 0&0&0&p^2 |z|^2&c_1&c_2&0&0 + 0&0&0&|c_1&p^2 |z|^2&0&0&0 + 0&0&0&|c_2 & 0&0&0&0 + 0&0&0&0&0&0&0&0 +     ) , [ timm]where @xmath94 the first term in the mass matrix denotes the scalar potential @xmath95 and is the standard hubble induced mass @xmath96 for scalar fields . note that the non - diagonal part of the mass matrix can be trivially reduced to a @xmath97 matrix since the complex field @xmath98 is not getting an additional mass term apart from the 1st term which gives @xmath98 a mass of @xmath99 . in the next section",
    "we illustrate the physical consequences of this mass matrix by focussing on a specific model .",
    "in this section we will analyze the ( post-)inflationary evolution and the appearance of instabilities in a specific model example .",
    "in particular , we will neglect the field @xmath98 that is decoupled during inflation and we will treat @xmath27 and @xmath29 as @xmath80 singlets . secondly , we take the specific superpotential w= m s z + ( p z l^1 + q s l^2 ) h^u , [ khalfnew2 ] with @xmath100 .",
    "this results in a number of simplifications since @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "looking at the mass matrix in eqn .",
    "we see that this means that we are removing the mixing between @xmath103 and @xmath29 ; the mass squared for @xmath103 is then simply given by @xmath104 .",
    "the rest of the mass matrix reduces to two @xmath105 blocks with eigenvalues [ eq : eigen ] ^2_= m^2 z^2 + 12 ( p^2 z^2 ) .",
    "the potential has thus two potentially tachyonic directions due to the mixing of the @xmath106 and @xmath29 .",
    "as mentioned above , this is expected since we do not satisfy the stability criteria derived in @xcite . in this class of models ,",
    "one typically has @xmath107 @xcite , whereas @xmath108 for a proper normalization of the spectrum of inflationary perturbations . by expanding the lower mass eigenvalue in powers of the small parameter @xmath21",
    ", one finds the following simple expression valid for @xmath109 : ^2 _ - = m^2(-q^2p^2 + z^2 ) + ( m^4 )  .",
    "[ eigen2]since the hyperbloc geometry restricts @xmath110 , this result implies that for @xmath111 there are two directions which are always tachyonic .",
    "this is true , in particular , for the typical case @xmath112 of @xcite .    to make this tachyonic direction explicit ,",
    "let us look at the potential of the fields @xmath113 and @xmath29 along the inflationary direction @xmath114 ( setting all other fields to zero since they are stable ) v = e^|l^2|^2+|h^u|^2 ( |mz+ q l^2 h^u|^2 + |p z h^u|^2)0  . [ pot]note that it is manifestly non - negative and has a stable minkowski vacuum when both terms vanish separately .",
    "however , during inflation the first square does not vanish due to the non - vanishing of the inflaton field , leading to a potential instability .    in terms of real components , @xmath115 the potential",
    "is given by [ modpot ] v = m^2z^2 e^z^2 a^2+m^2h^2(1 + h^2 ( p^2+q^2 a^2 ) + 2 q h a ( + ) ) .",
    "note that here we effectively rescaled the slepton and higgs fields @xmath113 and @xmath29 in this expression : the field @xmath116 is given in the units of the inflaton field @xmath33 , which starts at @xmath117 during inflation , and then gradually decreases .",
    "meanwhile the rescaled higgs field @xmath118 is expressed in units of the inflaton mass @xmath119 .",
    "the extremum of the potential with respect to @xmath120 occurs at @xmath121 ; without any loss of generality one can take @xmath122 . then the potential becomes [ modpot2 ] v = m^2z^2 e^z^2 a^2+m^2h^2(1 + h^2 ( p^2+q^2 a^2 ) - 2 q h a ) .",
    "the last term reveals the only potential source of the instability : a possibility of a simultaneous growth of @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "this corresponds to the eigenvector with the possibly tachyonic mass eigenvalue @xmath125 .",
    "there are two ways to partially remedy this problem .",
    "first of all , one can add the stabilizing term @xmath126 to the  potential .",
    "this modifies the expression for the lowest mass eigenstates : _ -^2 = m^2(-q^2p^2 + ( 1 + ) z^2 ) + ( m^4 )  .",
    "this correction helps for sufficiently large @xmath33 : during inflation , with @xmath127 , we require that 1 + > q^2p^2  .",
    "however , after inflation for @xmath128 one can see from ( [ eigen2 ] ) that a tachyon instability will develop for z^2 < q^2(1 + ) p^2  . until this happens",
    ", the  stabilization works pretty well .",
    "however , as soon as the tachyonic instability develops , a detailed investigation of the behavior of the system becomes unreliable because the  stabilization does not protect the fields @xmath113 and @xmath129 against falling towards the boundary of the moduli space .",
    "this can be seen by following the  metric of the stabilizer field along the tachyonic direction , which can be approximated by @xmath130 therefore any significant modification of the  potential with @xmath131 leads to a tachyonic instability that renders the stabilizer fields ghost - like at some finite @xmath33 .",
    "one could expect that this instability must stop at sufficiently large values of the fields @xmath113 and @xmath129 , where the potential develops an infinitely high barrier due to the stabilizing terms .",
    "however , a detailed investigation of this issue shows that the minimum of the potential occurs infinitesimally close to the boundary of the moduli space , where the potential barrier becomes infinitesimally thin .",
    "in this situation one can not be sure that the  stabilization actually protects the stability of the system once the tachyonic instability started to develop .",
    "fortunately , one can avoid this problem .",
    "a similar modification of @xmath132 can be achieved by replacing the constant @xmath133 in the superpotential by @xmath134 , and replacing @xmath135 by @xmath136 .",
    "since these extra terms disappear at the minimum of the potential at @xmath63 , this modification does not affect the late - time neutrino mass matrix . during inflation ,",
    "however , the mass is modified to [ tm ] _",
    "-^2 = m^2 ( z^2 - ) + ( m^4 )  .",
    "this leads to a stabilization of the lepton and higgs fields if @xmath137 and @xmath138 take sufficiently large positive values .",
    "for instance , taking @xmath139 and @xmath140 , the instability is absent as long as we satisfy [ phtr ] z^2(1 + 2- ^2 z^2 ) > 1  .",
    "just as with the  stabilization , this method works only until the field @xmath33 becomes small .",
    "one can delay the onset of the instability by increasing @xmath137 , but it is extremely difficult to avoid it .",
    "this instability leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking with generation of the classical fields @xmath106 and @xmath29 , but without the problematic issues with the boundary of the moduli space , which emerge as a result of the  moduli stabilization .",
    "we illustrate this statement for the simplest case with @xmath112 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 in fig .",
    "[ ff1 ] . with this simple choice of parameters , the negative term in ( [ tm ] ) almost exactly disappears during inflation , which occurs at @xmath117 . as a result ,",
    "during the main part of inflation at @xmath117 the mass eigenvalue is positive . in accord with ( [ phtr ] )",
    ", there is no tachyonic instability during inflation until the last two e - foldings of inflation when the field @xmath33 becomes smaller than @xmath143 . in that case",
    ", the emerging tachyonic instability does not fully develop until well after the end of inflation .",
    "one can stabilize the fields even further , by considering @xmath144 in . ) , ( [ phtr ] ) is designed to avoid generation of these additional perturbations until the very end of inflation .",
    "however , such additional perturbations might appear if we turn off the stabilization . ]       in general , one may wonder whether we need any stabilization at all , since we already learned that it can only temporarily protected the from the tachyonic instability .",
    "one can obtain an analytic understanding of the development of this instability from the scalar potential , without using any stabilization .",
    "we will be interested in @xmath145 and hence neglect the second term in the exponential . in this approximation ,",
    "the minima for the matter fields are located at @xmath146 note that there is only an instability at @xmath60 when assuming that @xmath133 exceeds @xmath135 , rendering the square real ; in other cases the origin is stable for matter fields .",
    "at these minima , the scalar potential along @xmath33 becomes for @xmath147 @xmath148 the instabilities therefore have a negligible effect on inflation ; the scalar potential only decreases by the square of the distance to the boundary @xmath149 .",
    "for instance , at @xmath150 which for @xmath71 corresponds to the point @xmath151 e - foldings until the end of inflation , the potential has only lost @xmath152 of its height as compared to its height @xmath153 at @xmath154 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "thus , the tachyonic instability at this stage , even if it brings the system to one of these two minima , practically does not change the height of the inflaton potential , and thus does not affect much the dynamics of inflation . a similar figure for @xmath155 , corresponding to the last @xmath156 e - folds of inflation , shows the potential with two minima which are only only 4% below the potential at the inflationary ridge .",
    "a detailed theory of the development of the tachyonic instability ( tachyonic preheating ) is described in @xcite . here",
    "we will only give its simple interpretation : initially , @xmath157 , and the first derivative of the potential in the directions of these fields vanish .",
    "therefore the classical equations of motion for these fields allow them to stay in this unstable state forever . however , quantum fluctuations of these fields with momenta smaller than the tachyonic mass @xmath158 grow exponentially , approximately as @xmath159 .",
    "the initial amplitude of quantum perturbations with momenta smaller than @xmath160 is @xmath161 .",
    "( for inflationary experts : this estimate is similar to the estimate for an average magnitude of inflationary perturbations @xmath162 . )",
    "the instability continues until @xmath163 becomes comparable to the value of the field in the minimum of the potential , which is @xmath164 in our model . for the typical tachyonic mass scale @xmath165 ,",
    "the time required for spontaneous symmetry breaking in our model is t_sb ~10 m^-1  . in reality",
    ", it is even somewhat longer .",
    "first of all , @xmath132 approaches its asymptotic value @xmath166 only gradually , at @xmath167 .",
    "in addition , the expansion of the universe slows down the motion of the field .",
    "therefore the growing quantum fluctuations of the fields @xmath168 remain extremely small ; their effect on other fields remains negligible during the interval @xmath169 .",
    "this time should be compared with the typical time intervals in our model .",
    "for example , during inflation , important changes may occur within the time interval corresponding to a single e - folding of inflation , [ d1 ] t_e ~h^-1 ~3 m^-1  , whereas after inflation the efficiency of reheating and preheating is usually determined by the number of oscillations of the inflaton field proportional to the inverse inflaton mass , [ d2 ] t_osc ~ m^-1  .",
    "comparison of these three time scales shows that for @xmath170 the tachyonic instability does not have enough time to develop within few e - foldings , or within a few oscillations of the inflaton field after inflation .",
    "nevertheless , this instability may significantly affect the process of reheating , by making the first , nonperturbative part of this process ( preheating ) much more efficient .",
    "indeed , preheating works by making quantum fluctuations of the fields grow exponentially due to parametric resonance during the field oscillations @xcite .",
    "this effect becomes even more efficient due to tachyonic instabilities , which allow these perturbations to grow even faster @xcite .",
    "thus , in general we deal with a very complicated process , tachyonic preheating , which can be fully studied only using lattice simulations along the lines of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the theory of this process differs dramatically from the naive theory of reheating ignoring the combination of the tachyonic instability and parametric resonance ; in some cases the fields may roll towards the minima of their potentials and relax there very rapidly , within just one or two oscillations @xcite . in our model ,",
    "the main part of this process is pretty simple : the fields fall down towards the flat directions of the potential .",
    "indeed , at small @xmath33 the potential flattens out in some directions and at @xmath63 the potential for the other fields becomes very simple : v = q^2  e^|h^u|^2 + |l^2|^2 |l^2|^2 |h^u|^2 = q^2  e^e^z^2 a^2+m^2h^2 m^2 z^2 a^2 h^2 .",
    "the potential is positive everywhere except along the two flat directions : it vanishes for all values of @xmath113 , if @xmath171 , and for all values of @xmath172 , if @xmath173 .",
    "the emergence of these flat directions with a gradual decrease of the field @xmath33 is apparent in fig .",
    "[ ff1 ] .",
    "after the post - inflationary reheating of the universe , the potential will acquire large thermal corrections proportional to @xmath174 , which will push the fields @xmath29 and @xmath106 along the flat directions towards zero @xcite .",
    "moreover , the process of symmetry restoration begins well before the end of thermalization , due to the out - of - equilibrium particles produced during the preheating @xcite .",
    "eventually , these fields should settle to their values determined by the potentials emerging in the standard model and its generalizations .",
    "the combination of all of these effects leads to the following scenario of the post - inflationary evolution : when the inflaton field @xmath33 becomes sufficiently small , the system experiences spontaneous symmetry breaking with generation of classical fields @xmath29 and @xmath27 which may grow up to nearly planckian values .",
    "however , in many cases the tachyonic instability may not have enough time to develop , and even if it does , it may be just a harmless ( and useful ) part of the scenario of tachyonic preheating . like many processes in the theory of preheating",
    ", the process of tachyonic preheating may be over within a few oscillations of the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "for example , the tachyonic preheating in the hybrid inflation scenario @xcite may end very quickly , within a single oscillation of the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "there is an interesting difference between the models that we studied in this paper and the hybrid inflation . in hybrid inflation ,",
    "the scalar fields after the tachyonic waterfall acquire large vacuum expectation values which could lead to superheavy cosmic strings .",
    "meanwhile we expect that in the models studied above the values of the fields @xmath29 and @xmath175 after preheating and high temperature symmetry restoration should become very small , being determined by the small additional mass terms defining the low - energy phenomenology of these fields .",
    "this is one of the issues which require a detailed phenomenological investigation .",
    "in this paper we studied how to use the inflationary @xmath0-attractor models to develop the idea of the minimal sneutrino inflation of the kind proposed in @xcite , which was based on a multi - natural inflation class of models with a discrete shift symmetry . in @xcite the coupling of the inflaton to leptons and higgs",
    "was arranged to depend on @xmath176 , so that it would never become very strong , even when the canonically normalized inflaton field @xmath30 takes super - planckian values .",
    "we argued that the same goal is easily reached in the context of the @xmath0-attractor models since the coupling of the inflaton to leptons and higgs is arranged using the natural geometric poincar disk variable @xmath177 .",
    "this puts strong geometric constraints on masses and coupling constants of particles , making the inflaton coupling to matter exponentially small at large values of the inflaton field @xcite .",
    "yet another advantage of @xmath0-attractors is that they provide one of the best fits to the existing observational data @xcite .",
    "the attractive feature of the minimal sneutrino inflation proposed in @xcite , that is also a feature of our @xmath0-attractor based models , is the potential to realize the seesaw mechanism .",
    "two heavy right - handed neutrinos are residing in the inflationary sector of the theory ( inflaton and stabilizer superfields ) , and have characteristic couplings associated with the scale of inflation @xmath178 gev .",
    "the light neutrinos then get the masses m_ab ^= v^2 ^2 ( ) m ( p_a p_b + q_a q_b ) . for @xmath179 and @xmath180 gev",
    "we find the scale of the light neutrinos to be of the order @xmath181 gev which is of the order ev , where they should be .",
    "a possible drawback of this minimal model , however , is that in order to make the model minimal and to be able to describe the physics of neutrinos properly with regards to the mns matrix , one has to make the inflaton sector interact directly with leptons and the higgs .",
    "this takes the inflationary sector out of the hidden sector , with a number of consequences .",
    "one of these is that it requires the additional hidden sector to break supersymmetry spontaneously ; this can not be achieved within the present model for the following reason . recall that in local supergravity there is a coupling between the gravitino @xmath182 and the goldstino , @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the goldstino .",
    "after supersymmetry breaking this leads to a massive gravitino whose extra longitudinal component is the goldstino @xmath184 .",
    "if we would break supersymmetry in the inflationary sector , then one linear combination of our fermions would be eaten by the gravitino and we would be left with only one heavy right handed neutrino , which is not sufficient to explain the observed neutrino masses . in sneutrino",
    "inflation one therefore has to restrict oneself to models for which at the end of inflation we have @xmath185 , such that the fermionic partners of the inflaton and the stabilizer can both be massive .",
    "we believe , however , that this problem can be easily addressed by adding to the superpotential of our model a term depending only on a separate nilpotent superfield .",
    "one can show that if the susy breaking induced by this term is sufficiently small , it does not affect the observational predictions of the inflationary model @xcite .",
    "a second point is that a direct coupling between inflation and particle physics may lead to stability issues .",
    "it was recently shown in @xcite that when inflation is in the hidden sector , adding matter causes no tachyonic instabilities under certain conditions which are not very restrictive .",
    "it is particularly important for this purpose to avoid a direct interaction between matter fields and the stabilizer @xmath19 , since this interaction may lead to tachyons . indeed , as expected from the results in @xcite , the negative terms in the mass eigenvalues in eq .",
    "are due to the coupling of the leptons and higgs field to the stabilizer @xmath19 .",
    "there are several different mechanisms which can be used to stabilize all fields during inflation , so that the presence of matter does not affect the inflationary evolution .",
    "however , the stabilization mechanisms studied in this paper offer only a temporary protection against the tachyonic instability .",
    "this instability emerges either at the late stages of inflation or shortly after it ends , when the inflaton field becomes sufficiently small . in the models that we were able to analyze this instability appears to be a harmless part of the process of tachyonic preheating .",
    "the tachyonic preheating tends to stimulate the energy transfer from the inflaton to the matter fields , thus making reheating faster and even more efficient than the process considered in @xcite . in supergravity",
    ", this is not necessarily a good thing , because a reheating temperature above @xmath186 gev may lead to the cosmological gravitino problem which plagued supergravity cosmology for more than three decades @xcite .",
    "one may solve this problem by considering a superheavy gravitino with mass @xmath187 tev @xcite .",
    "however , in this case one must get rid of the excess of lsp produced by gravitino decay , e.g. by introducing r - parity violation @xcite . thus there is a price to pay for the high reheating temperature which appears in sneutrino inflation .",
    "yet another problem to be studied in this class of models is the origin of cp violation required to explain leptogenesis naturally .    on the other hand ,",
    "a high reheating temperature requires a greater number @xmath67 of e - foldings of inflation , which slightly increases the spectral index @xmath188 for @xmath0-attractors .",
    "this may be desirable for improving the compatibility of these models , as well as of the starobinsky model , with the latest observational data @xcite .",
    "independently of all of these issues , we believe that the investigation of the tachyonic instability in this model provides an interesting example of a very unusual dynamical behavior where an instability may lead to the generation of scalar fields of nearly planckian amplitude , which , however , tend to disappear after the subsequent cosmological evolution .",
