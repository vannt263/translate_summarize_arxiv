    "this discrepancy between gas and dust masses indicates that mm - j1545 is not a prestellar core .",
    "furthermore , the sma continuum observations at 890  @xmath1 and 1.3  mm revealed a very compact source , compared to usual prestellar cores (   [ sect : individual ] ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : uvplot ] , its visibility distribution does not show any evidence for an extended structure like a dense gas envelope , which is at least @xmath2320.01  pc and typically @xmath114  pc in size , corresponding to an angular size of @xmath115 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : uvplot ] , we show fourier transform of 890-@xmath1 brightness distribution predicted for a critical bonnor ",
    "ebert sphere @xcite as a realization of a starless core in the lupus - i cloud .",
    "the gas temperature and central h@xmath287 density is assumed to be 7.1  k and @xmath300  @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "the total gas mass of @xmath301 is chosen so that the total 890-@xmath1 flux density matches the observed one .",
    "the overall visibility slope and amplitude at higher spatial frequencies are , however , largely deviated from the prediction of the bonnor  ebert model .",
    "a possible galactic interpretation of mm - j1545 might be a first hydrostatic core @xcite in its very early phase , because its compact nature and the very cold ( @xmath302  k ) and low - luminosity ( @xmath303 ) sed are consistent with those expected in a mostly - naked first core @xcite . in this case ,",
    "c@xmath77o emission line is optically thick and the non - detection of c@xmath77o is explained if a significant fraction of gas mass , which is inferred from the dust sed ( @xmath304 ) , might be stored behind the c@xmath77o photosphere . in figure",
    "[ fig : uvplot ] , we show the fourier components of a 890-@xmath1 brightness distribution predicted for a first hydrostatic core , which is computed by radiation hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the first hydrostatic core is produced by gravitational collapse of a @xmath305 bonnor  ebert sphere , and the mass and inclination angle are chosen so that the overall visibility amplitudes match the observed data .",
    "consequently , the unresolved cusp - like structure appeared at @xmath306  k@xmath97 and the extended envelope predicted from the first core model are consistent with the actual sma visibility amplitudes .",
    "note that the adjacent compact nir source , j1545b , and the observed jvla 6  cm flux density at the sma position can not be explained consistently with the other data even in the first hydrostatic core models .",
    "we also note that first hydrostatic cores should be extremely rare because of the short lifetime ; only one first core out of @xmath2321001000 dense starless cores is expected , if comparing the lifetime with the dynamical time scale of starless cores ( @xmath2320.11 myr ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath1805 lensed smg is the most likely and naturally explained by the sed and geometry / spatial extent of the multi - wavelength counterpart to mm - j1545 .",
    "we report serendipitous detections of two 1.1-mm bright extragalactic sources , mm j154506.4@xmath0344318 ( mm - j1545 ) and mm j154132.7@xmath0350320 ( mm - j1541 ) , in the aztec / aste survey of the lupus - i star - forming region .",
    "these sources are likely located at cosmological distances at @xmath1805 ( mm - j1545 ) and @xmath191 ( mm - j1541 ) .",
    "the main results are as follows :    1 .",
    "mm - j1545 is the brightest ( @xmath307  mjy ) of @xmath308 smgs identified through the whole aztec 1.1-mm galaxy surveys .",
    "sma ( 890  @xmath1 and 1.3  mm ) interferometry confirms the exact position , and photometry from vla , atca , nma , and _ herschel _ , in addition to aztec / aste and sma , constrains the sed well , which is in good agreement with a single gray - body with @xmath309  k and @xmath138 (   [ sect : mmj1545 ] ) .",
    "the sed fits to the photometry at @xmath310 indicate a redshift of @xmath3115.6 ( a combination of 68% confidence intervals of sed fits using the arp  220 , average smg , and smm  j2135 templates ) (   [ sect : photoz ] ) .",
    "this is also supported by the ( sub)mm color analysis , in which we show that mm - j1545 is situated in a region where @xmath1805 dusty galaxies are expected on the @xmath312@xmath313 diagram (   [ sect : color ] ) . a faint nir object , j1545b ,",
    "is identified @xmath145 east of the sma 890-@xmath1 peak , which is likely a foreground lensing object that amplifies mm - j1545 .",
    "although it is difficult to constrain the sed of j1545b , the einstein radius would be @xmath245 if the lens redshift is @xmath314 .",
    "even if this is the case and the magnification factor might be as high as 10 , the demagnified fir luminosity is still extreme ( @xmath315 ) , suggesting that mm - j1545 is intrinsically a hyper - luminous galaxy at @xmath1805 (   [ sect : gravlens ] ) .",
    "mm - j1541 is identified as the fourth brightest 1.1-mm source ( @xmath316  mjy ) of the whole aztec surveys .",
    "this object is also seen in the spire 250500  @xmath1 and mips 24  @xmath1 bands (   [ sect : mmj1541 ] ) .",
    "the inferred photometric redshift ranges @xmath3174.1 ( a combination of 68% confidence intervals of sed fits using the arp  220 , m  82 , average smg , and smm  j2135 templates ) (   [ sect : photoz ] ) .",
    "again , this is also supported by the aztec ",
    "spire color analysis (   [ sect : color ] ) . an optical / nir image ( j1541b )",
    "is clearly offset from the 24-@xmath1 centroid by @xmath318 , and the sed of j1541b is consistent with a bright galaxy at @xmath319 , suggesting that j1541b gravitationally magnifies the background smg , mm - j1541 .",
    "gravitational lens modeling using the faber - jackson relation and a singular isothermal sphere shows the magnification factor of mm - j1541 is moderate ( @xmath320 ) , suggesting that mm - j1541 might be an intrinsically hyper - luminous star - forming galaxy with @xmath23313.9 (   [ sect : gravlens ] ) .",
    "the brightest - end ( @xmath321  mjy ) of the 1.1-mm cumulative number counts is constrained by mm - j1545 and mm - j1541 , in addition to another two sources from the literature ; @xmath322  deg@xmath6 , @xmath323  deg@xmath6 , and @xmath324  deg@xmath6 .",
    "the slope at @xmath325  mjy is shallower than the deeper part of the source counts obtained from general deep fields such as goods and cosmos .",
    "the amplitude and slope at the brightest - end is consistent not only with that properly scaled from the 1.4-mm counts obtained by the south pole telescope survey , which are thought to be dominated by strongly - lensed smgs , but also with a model prediction where flux magnification due to strong gravitational lensing is accounted for .",
    "this suggests that a substantial fraction of @xmath321  mjy sources may be gravitationally amplified .",
    "the overall sed from the optical to the radio and the spatial structure of mm - j1545 are explained neither by a local prestellar core nor a protostellar object , although it is found toward a relatively high h@xmath287 column region of the local molecular cloud . a possible explanation for a galactic object might be a first hydrostatic core with no envelope structure . even in this case , however ,",
    "neither the 6-cm continuum emission nor the nir compact object , j1545b , @xmath145 away from mm - j1545 can be explained by any models for a first hydrostatic core . on the other hand ,",
    "a @xmath1805 smg strongly lensed by j1545b naturally accounts for all of the observed properties .",
    "hence we conclude that mm - j1545 is not a first hydrostatic core but a galaxy at a cosmological distance .",
    "unexpectedly , an extremely - bright smg at @xmath7 and a galactic low - mass dense starless core ( e.g. , an exposed first hydrostatic core ) could be similar in the mid - infrared to millimeter spectral energy distributions and spatial structures at least at @xmath8 .",
    "this indicates that it is necessary to distinguish the two possibilities by means of broad band photometry from the optical to centimeter , when a compact object is identified toward galactic star - forming regions .",
    "( sub)millimeter spectroscopy and/or sub - arcsec imaging of the object will help to determine the redshift and the presence of gravitational magnification , which will be able to carried out using alma .",

    "<S> we report detections of two candidate distant submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) , mm  j154506.4@xmath0344318 and mm  j154132.7@xmath0350320 , which are discovered in the aztec / aste 1.1  mm survey toward the lupus - i star - forming region . </S>",
    "<S> the two objects have 1.1  mm flux densities of 43.9 and 27.1  mjy , and have _ </S>",
    "<S> herschel_/spire counterparts as well . </S>",
    "<S> the submillimeter array counterpart to the former smg is identified at 890  @xmath1 and 1.3  mm . </S>",
    "<S> photometric redshift estimates using all available data from the mid - infrared to the radio suggest that the redshifts of the two smgs are @xmath25 and 3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> near - infrared objects are found very close to the smgs and they are consistent with low-@xmath3 ellipticals , suggesting that the high apparent luminosities can be attributed to gravitational magnification . </S>",
    "<S> the cumulative number counts at @xmath4  mjy , combined with other two 1.1-mm brightest sources , are @xmath5  deg@xmath6 , which is consistent with a model prediction that accounts for flux magnification due to strong gravitational lensing . </S>",
    "<S> unexpectedly , a @xmath7 smg and a galactic dense starless core ( e.g. , a first hydrostatic core ) could be similar in the mid - infrared to millimeter spectral energy distributions and spatial structures at least at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that it is necessary to distinguish the two possibilities by means of broad band photometry from the optical to centimeter and spectroscopy to determine the redshift , when a compact object is identified toward galactic star - forming regions . </S>"
