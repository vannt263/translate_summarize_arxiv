    "it is important to measure the distance accurately , because most physical properties of individual sources , such as sizes , masses , luminosities depend critically on the distance .",
    "the kinematic distance , which is derived from the observed radial velocity and the galactic rotation model , is widely used to estimate the distance from sun to the source in the milky way galaxy ( mwg ) . however , the kinematic distance would be different from the real distance , in the case that the source motion is affected by the local activities such as the supernova ( sn ) and the super - bubble , the potential of galactic bar , and the streaming motion of the spiral arm .",
    "recent very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) astrometric observations determined the distances of the numerous maser sources directly from the parallax measurements .",
    "some of vlbi observations report that there is a difference between the parallactic distance and the kinematic distance ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is because that these observed sources have large peculiar motions possibly originated with the expanding super - bubble ( @xcite ) , the gravitational perturbations from the galactic bar ( @xcite ) , and the expanding 3 kpc arm ( @xcite ) .",

    "their kinematic distances are also different .",
    "the near and far kinematic distances of g48.61 + 0.02 are derived to be 1.4 and 9.8 kpc , respectively , in the case that iau recommended values of the galactic constants , @xmath8 kpc and @xmath9 km s@xmath5 , and the flat rotation are assumed .",
    "the 21 cm wavelength hi absorption measurements suggest that g48.61 + 0.02 is located at the far kinematic distance ( @xcite ) .",
    "the parallactic distance of w51 is measured to be @xmath10 kpc by the h@xmath0o maser astrometric observations with the very long baseline interferometry ( vlba ) ( @xcite ) , and it is consistent with the kinematic distance .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that g48.61 + 0.02 is far away from w51 in the line of sight direction , and these two sources are not physically associated ( @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we performed the astrometry of h@xmath0o masers in the galactic star - forming region g48.61 + 0.02 with the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) . </S>",
    "<S> we derived a trigonometric parallax of @xmath1 @xmath2as , which corresponds to a distance of @xmath3 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the distance to g48.61 + 0.02 is about a half of its far kinematic distance , which was often assumed previously . </S>",
    "<S> this distance places g48.61 + 0.02 in the sagittarius - carina arm and near the active star forming region and the supernova remnant w51 . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtained the three dimensional motion of g48.61 + 0.02 , and found that it has a large peculiar motion of @xmath4 km s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this peculiar motion would be originated with the multiple supernovae explosions in w51 , or the streaming motion across the sagittarius - carina arm . </S>"
