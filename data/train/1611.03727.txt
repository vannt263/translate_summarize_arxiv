    "general relativity ( gr ) is a classical guage theory to describe long range interaction between gravitational objects .",
    "it alone can also account for the accelerated expansion of the universe using a fine- tuned cosmological constant term @xmath1@xcite-@xcite or quintessence scalar field as dark energy @xcite,@xcite or quintom fields @xcite .",
    "however the existance of dark energy requires the introduction of additional fluids capable of dominating over the standard pressure less matter @xcite .",
    "there is a simpler course to get around dark energy and to consistently explain the accelrated expansion .",
    "this is done by considering a cosmological constant .",
    "however the necessary expected value of the cosmological constant must be extremely larger than the observed value .",
    "this is due to quantum considerations @xcite .",
    "there however is an internally consistent approach to account for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "this is based on addressing the cosmic dynamics by exploring further degrees of freedom of the gravitational field . in other words to account for the accelerated dynamics of the universe , the einstien hilbert action of general relativity is modified @xcite-@xcite . recently a different but interesting modification introduced as gravity s rainbow models @xcite as an extension of the doubly special relativity theory @xcite , in which several interesting features have been studied like absence of effective horizon in black holes , black rings , mini black holes , gravitational collapse , brane solutions and others @xcite .",
    "an extensively studied approach to modified gravity stems from the `` teleparallel equivalent to general relativity '' ( tegr ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that unlike general relativity to explain the gravitational effects tegr uses an anti symmetric connection equipped with a non - vanishing torsion and a zero curvature ( weitzenbock connection ) . in other words",
    "tegr uses torsion to explain gravitational effects unlike general relativity which uses curvature .",
    "it may be moted that in order to define the weitzenbock connection in tegr tetrad fields are used as dynamical variables @xcite .    using tegr a straight forward modification of the einstien hilbert action",
    "may be performed by replacing the scalar torsion with an arbitrary smoooth function of the scalar torsion @xmath0 .",
    "this class of teleparallel theories is known as @xmath0 gravity ( see @xcite and refrences in for a comprehensive review ) . accelerated expansion of the cosmic hubble parameter as well as dark matter can be explained using @xmath0 gravity @xcite-@xcite .    in gravitational theories ,",
    "localized and positive valued mass densities could suddenly collapse , emerging thermodynamics that can produce a hydrodynamic pressure impose on the mass distribution . if the collapse of the matter distribution is continued then mass contents are transformed into a compact star .",
    "the compact star has a finite size @xmath2 and a huge amount of mass of order of solar mass @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a type of compact star is neutron star , it has very strong surface gravity and conequently a strongly coupled regime of thermodynamics .",
    "a way to detect these massive objects is by looking at the doppler shift in spectral lines emitted by atoms in the surface of the candidated stars .",
    "one can find not much gravity on the earth , more on the compact star because surface gravity of such stars is of order @xmath4 . except than this big surface gravity",
    ", there is a greater difference between individual plants which makes the species and neutron stars .",
    "a reason is that the gravitational field from compact stars , have both electric and magnetic components and contains a definite amount of electromagnetic energy and thanks to some basic parameters , for example emission above - ground level , the electromagnetic effects are stronger than thermodynamic effects .",
    "it was demonstrated that the thermodynamic parameters , namely pressure @xmath5 , energy density @xmath6 , the mass function @xmath7 and radius @xmath8 are related according to a set of _ state _ equations , called as tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations in gr @xcite-@xcite .",
    "tov equation is a set of first order , non linear differential equations for a spherically symmetric metric which is filled with the perfect fluid with pressure and energy density .",
    "recently tov equations and dynamics of neutron stars have been investigated for different types of modified gravity models from @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath0 ( @xmath11 is torsion ) numerically and also in a non - perturbative scheme @xcite- @xcite .    the compact astrophysical objects such as black holes @xcite , wormholes @xcite,@xcite and compact stars have been extensively studied withtin the framework of teleparallel gravity @xcite-@xcite . in fact",
