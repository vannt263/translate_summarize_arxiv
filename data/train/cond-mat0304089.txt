    "many transition metal ( tm ) compounds show an orbital ordering @xcite .",
    "typical examples are tm oxides with so - called strong jahn - teller ( jt ) ions , e.g. cu@xmath0(d@xmath2 ) , mn@xmath1(d@xmath3 ) , low - spin ni@xmath1(d@xmath4 ) etc , which in the cubic crystal field of a regular oxygen octahedron have one electron or one hole on the doubly degenerate @xmath5 level . according to the well - known jahn - teller theorem , such states are inherently unstable , and at low temperatures a distortion of the local coordination lifts this orbital degeneracy . in concentrated systems",
    "it leads to a phase transition - the so - called cooperative jahn - teller effect or orbital ordering @xcite .",
    "an orbital ordering is also observed in materials with partially filled three - fold degenerate @xmath6-levels of tm ions , e.g. ti@xmath1(@xmath7 ) or v@xmath1(@xmath8 ) .",
    "some of these materials have very unusual properties @xcite .",
    "however , the jt effect for @xmath6-electrons is usually weaker than for @xmath5-electrons and can be strongly affected by the spin - orbital interaction @xmath9 , which for @xmath5-electrons is essentially quenched .",
    "this complicates the discussion of orbital ordering in @xmath6-systems and in this paper we concentrate on materials with @xmath5 electrons , though many of our conclusions can be applied to @xmath6-systems too .",
    "an orbital ordering can be described similarly to a magnetic ( spin ) ordering . in the case of one electron or hole on a",
    "doubly - degenerate orbital , one can describe the orbital occupation introducing a pseudospin ( or isospin ) @xmath10 , so that , e.g. , the @xmath11 orbital corresponds to the state with @xmath12 .",
    "a superposition of these two orbital states @xmath13 is associated with a particular point on a circle in the @xmath14-plane , see fig.[circle ] .",
    "we only consider here linear combinations with real coefficients . in principle",
    ", one can also consider states with complex coefficients , e.g. , @xmath15 but they are rather special : they do not couple to the lattice , but break the time - reversal symmetry and have a nonzero magnetic octupole moment @xcite .",
    "such states are eigenstates of the @xmath16 operator that usually does not appear in the exchange hamiltonian of doubly - degenerate jt systems .",
    "the pseudospin operators can be used to describe interactions between orbitals on different tm sites in the same way one describes the spin exchange .",
    "an orbital ordering corresponds then to a nonvanishing average pseudospin @xmath17 .",
    "however , the orbital exchange usually has a more complicated form than the spin exchange , due to the directional nature of orbitals .",
    "the strong anisotropy gives rise to a frustration of orbital ordering even in materials with simple bipartite lattices .",
    "the @xmath14 pseuodospin plane .",
    "the points a , b , c and d on the circle correspond , respectively , to the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 orbitals.,width=151 ]",
    "we illustrate this point by considering effective orbital interactions in a perovskite lattice - a simple cubic lattice of tm ions with oxygens located on the edges between them ( we ignore here for simplicity the tilting of ( tm)o@xmath22-octahedra present in many materials , which lowers the symmetry from cubic to orthorombic ) .",
    "there are two mechanisms of orbital ordering : a lattice instability due to the jt coupling of electrons to lattice @xcite , and a purely electronic mechanism resulting from the virtual hopping of tm electrons between neighboring sites @xcite .",
    "both lead to essentially the same type of effective exchange interactions .",
    "we first discuss the lattice - mediated orbital exchange .",
    "consider a pair of neighboring tm sites @xmath23 and @xmath24 along the @xmath25 axis ( see fig.[jt ] ) .",
    "for this pair the electron - lattice interaction responsible for lifting the double degeneracy of the @xmath5-states has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 creates the state @xmath28 at the site @xmath29 with the spin projection @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the creation operator of the other @xmath5-state @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 phonon coordinate is the linear combination of the shifts of oxygens ( from the o@xmath22-octahedron containing the tm site @xmath23 ) along the corresponding tm - tm bonds ( see fig.[jt ] ) : @xmath34.\\ ] ]     a pair of tm ions ( black circles ) along the @xmath25 axis in the perovskite lattice .",
    "arrows indicate the shifts of oxygen ions ( white circles ) resulting in lifting of the double degeneracy present for a regular o@xmath22-octahedron.,width=113 ]    in the subspace of states with one electron per tm site the combination of the electron operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eq.([eq : jt ] ) is equivalent to the pseudospin operator : @xmath37 excluding the coordinate @xmath38 of the oxygen located between the two tm ions , we obtain for an effective orbital interaction for the pair @xmath39 which has the ( antiferroorbital ) ising form favoring the antiparallel alignment of neighboring pseudospins , e.g. @xmath40 ( the @xmath18 orbital on the site @xmath23 ) and @xmath41 ( the @xmath42 orbital on site @xmath24 ) .",
    "however , complications arise when we consider effective orbital interactions in the whole cubic lattice of tm ions .",
    "since in the cubic lattice the three directions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath25 are equivalent , we can describe the exchange along the @xmath43 direction by replacing the basis of states ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) by ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) and similarly for the @xmath44 direction .",
    "the symmetry of the cubic lattice under circular permutations of the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath25 axes is reflected in the three - fold symmetry of the @xmath14-plane ( see fig.[circle ] ) , where the states @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 correspond , respectively , to @xmath49 ( point a in fig.[circle ] ) , @xmath50 ( point c ) , and @xmath51 ( point d ) , where @xmath52 one can also introduce the corresponding symmetric notation for pseudospin operators @xmath53 so that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 . using the symmetry of the cubic lattice and eq.([hz ] ) , we can then immediately write the hamiltonian of the exchange along the @xmath43 axis , @xmath56 and similarly for a pair along the @xmath44 axis : @xmath57    the full hamiltonian of lattice mediated effective orbital interactions has the form @xmath58 it includes also the on - site term ( the second sum in eq.([isocompass ] ) ) , which suppresses complex orbitals discussed above by favoring alignments of pseudospins in the @xmath59 plane .",
    "we can now see the source of the frustration in the orbital sector : while the exchange along the @xmath25 direction stabilizes alternating @xmath60 and @xmath19 orbitals , the equivalent couplings along the @xmath43 and @xmath44 directions favor other pairs of orbitals , i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "a simple - looking spin model with similar properties ( sometimes called the `` compass '' model ) was introduced in 1982 in ref .  [ ] : @xmath63 it is very similar to the model eq .",
    "( [ isocompass ] ) , but while the three components of the pseudospin , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ( see eq.([ioperators ] ) , obey the condition @xmath67 , the spin projections @xmath68 , @xmath55 are independent operators .",
    "consider the model eq.([eq : compass ] ) with @xmath69 ( ferromagnetic interactions ) , in which case the angular dependence of the spin exchange is similar to that of the conventional dipole - dipole interaction , and indeed , its properties can be qualitatively understood by considering the lattice of `` compasses '' ( or magnetic needles ) .",
    "the complications arising in this model are immediately clear from this analogy .",
    "if , instead of the square lattice , we consider a one - dimensional raw of such compasses in the @xmath25 direction , it is clear that the magnetic needles would order `` head to tail '' parallel to the @xmath25 axis .",
    "however , in a row along the @xmath43 axis , spins would prefer to order in the @xmath43 direction . in a square and in a cubic lattice",
    "this leads to a strong frustration , which in principle can destroy an order altogether .",
    "such claim was indeed made by glass and lawson for a similar model with real dipole - dipole ( long - range ) interactions @xcite : using the bogolyubov inequality they proved the absence of a long - range magnetic ordering at nonzero temperatures in two and three dimensions .",
    "interestingly enough , the situation here is in a sense opposite to that in conventional systems : while in standard models with a continuous symmetry , like the heisenberg model , the order is destroyed by fluctuations in one- and two - dimensional cases , but can exist in three - dimensional systems , here the order survives in one dimension , but is broken for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "this can be traced back to different symmetry properties of the two types of models : in contrast to the heisenberg model , which has a continuous symmetry and , correspondingly , goldstone modes , in eqs .",
    "( [ isocompass ] ) and ( [ eq : compass ] ) the interaction for each pair has an ising character .",
    "however , while in heisenberg - like models the spin and coordinate spaces are largely independent , in the model eq.([eq : compass ] ) a rotation in the spin space is inherently related to the corresponding rotation in the coordinate space .",
    "this seems to `` restore '' the symmetry of the system : if we assume a ferromagnetic ordering for @xmath72 and calculate the spin - wave excitation spectrum , we find that the spectrum is gapless despite the discrete ising type of interactions for each pair . moreover , this spectrum turns out to be one - dimensional for a square lattice and two - dimensional for a cubic lattice : @xmath73 and @xmath74 so that the corresponding fluctuations diverge at all temperatures for @xmath70 , and at any @xmath75 for @xmath76 case .",
    "this agrees with the fact that on the mean - field level there are many equivalent degenerate ground states in our system : apart from ferromagnetic states with an arbitrary orientation of spins @xmath77 , there also states with ferromagnetic chains e.g. along the @xmath25 axis , with spins either parallel or antiparallel to the @xmath25-direction and no correlations between orientations of spins in different chains .",
    "what is the true ground state of this model , is still an open problem .",
    "one possibility is that beyond the mean - filed approximation the order - from - disorder scenario @xcite selects a particular ordered state @xcite .",
    "another alternative is that the spin fluctuations are so strong that they destroy a long - range order , leading to a ( spin- or orbital- ) liquid state @xcite . in any case",
    ", we see that properties of the models eqs .",
    "( [ isocompass ] ) and ( [ eq : compass ] ) are rather unusual .",
    "we would like now to return to jt systems and discuss the purely electronic contribution to exchange interactions in these materials .",
    "the calculation of the exchange hamiltonian , resulting from the virtual hopping of electrons on neighboring sites , is usually done using the hubbard model describing electrons on degenerate @xmath78-levels @xcite @xmath79 here @xmath80 are site indices , @xmath30 denotes spin projection , and @xmath81 are orbital indices . the second term in eq.([hubbard ] )",
    "describes the on - site coulomb repulsion between electrons , which depends on the orbital occupation , and the last term is the hund s rule exchange interaction between electrons occupying two different orbitals on the same site . for an isolated ion",
    ", we have @xmath82 .",
    "however , in crystals the direct coulomb interactions @xmath83 are modified by the screening , while the hund s rule exchange coupling @xmath84 remains unscreened .",
    "therefore , @xmath83 and @xmath84 should be considered as independent parameters .    for one electron or one hole per tm site , and in the strong coupling limit @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the electron band width",
    ", an effective hamiltonian describing the coupled spin and orbital degrees of freedom can be obtained using the perturbation theory in @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the hopping matrix elements @xmath88 are spin - independent ( spin is conserved in the process of the virtual electron hopping ) . as a result ,",
    "the spin part of the exchange operator is rotationally invariant and has the standard heisenberg form @xmath89 .",
    "in contrast , the hopping amplitudes depend on the type of the initial and final orbital , as well as on the spatial orientation of the pair of tm ions ( see e.g. fig.[180 ] ) , as a result of which the orbital part of the exchange hamiltonian is strongly anisotropic .",
    "the overlap between @xmath78-orbitals of tm ions in the @xmath90-exchange.,width=188 ]    for the pair of tm sites @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the hopping only occurs between the two @xmath18 orbitals ( see fig.[180]a ) : the hopping between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 orbitals is zero by symmetry ( see fig.[180]b ) , and the overlap between the two @xmath19 orbitals in the @xmath25 direction is very small ( see fig.[180]c ) .",
    "therefore , the usual type of exchange for this pair only occurs when the @xmath18 orbitals ( @xmath91 ) are occupied on both sites . by the well - known goodenough - kanamori - anderson ( gka ) rules ,",
    "such an exchange is antiferromagnetic , favoring the spin - singlet state of the two electrons ( holes ) .",
    "this considerations allow us to immediately write an effective exchange hamiltonian for this pair : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the hopping amplitude between the two @xmath18 orbitals .",
    "the exchange hamiltonian is proportional to the product of the projection operators on the orbital states @xmath94 on the two tm sites and the projection operator on the spin singlet state with @xmath95 .",
    "the ground state of such a pair is a spin singlet with an orbital configuration shown in fig.[180]a , in contrast to the ( spin - triplet ) state shown in fig.[jt ] , stabilized by jt stabilized by the electron - lattice interaction .",
    "due to the electron - hole symmetry of the orbitally degenerate hubbard hamiltonian eq.([hubbard ] ) , the effective hamiltonians for one hole and one electron per tm site have the same form .",
    "there is also another mechanism of orbital exchange due to the hopping of electrons on empty orbitals of neighboring sites and the hund s rule ferromagnetic spin coupling @xcite , but it is usually weaker than the antiferromagnetic interaction eq.([gka ] ) and we shall not discuss it here .    as in the derivation of eqs .",
    "( [ hx ] ) and ( [ hy ] ) , the exchange interaction for pairs of tm ions along the @xmath43 and @xmath44 directions can be obtained from eq.([gka ] ) by the corresponding rotation in the orbital space , i.e. , by substituting the operators @xmath96 in that equation by , respectively , the @xmath64 and @xmath65 operators .",
    "the resulting exchange hamiltonian for the cubic lattice is sometimes called the kugel - khomskii ( kk ) model . the coupled orbital and spin exchange , described by eq.([gka ] ) and",
    "the corresponding expressions for @xmath97 and @xmath98 , has the same spatial anisotropy as the lattice - mediated orbital interactions eq.([isocompass ] ) , and we face again the problem of frustrated orbital ordering . it was even suggested that the coupling between orbitals and spins in eq.([gka ] ) makes it only worse : it gives anomalously soft mixed spin - orbital excitations , resulting in a spin - orbital liquid ground state @xcite .",
    "other authors , however , argued that this coupling actually helps to lift the frustration , resulting in orbitally and magnetically ordered states , in which spins form antiferromagnetic chains ( as in the cubic perovskite kcuf@xmath99 ) , stabilized by large quantum spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it seems that the only way to clarify this controversy is to perform a direct numerical simulation of the model eq.([gka ] ) , but the latter is complicated by the sign problem ( which again is a consequence of frustration ) .",
    "so far , we only discussed a simple cubic lattice of tm ions and showed that even in that case orbital interactions are frustrated . there are also many jahn - teller materials with lattices that can not be naturally subdivided into two sublattices of tm ions , e.g. a two - dimensional triangular and kagome lattice , or a pyrochlore lattice of corner - shared tetrahedra , e.g. the b - sublattice of spinels .",
    "an antiferromagnetic spin ordering in materials with such lattices is known to be strongly frustrated @xcite and it is interesting to see , if such ` geometric ' effect can enhance the frustration of orbital interactions .",
    "the typical example of such a material is linio@xmath101 , in which the low - spin ni@xmath102 ions with spin @xmath103 and doubly degenerate orbitals ( @xmath10 ) , occupy two - dimensional triangular [ 111 ] layers ( see fig.[nili ] ) .",
    "while in perovskites the angle between metal - oxygen bonds connecting neighboring tm ions is @xmath90 , in linio@xmath101 this angle is @xmath104 .",
    "this difference has important consequences for the spin and orbital exchange @xcite .",
    "the actual exchange in tm oxides occurs not due to a direct @xmath105-hopping , as described by eq.([hubbard ] ) , but involves the hopping from oxygens to tm sites and intermediate states with holes on oxygen @xmath106-orbitals .",
    "thus we have to start from the d - p model : @xmath107 here @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the orbital indices of , respectively , oxygen @xmath106-orbitals and tm @xmath78-orbitals , and the hamiltonian of the model includes the direct ( hubbard ) and the exchange ( hund s rule ) coulomb interactions on both the oxygen and tm ions .    in the mott - hubbard ( mh ) region of the general zaanen - sawatzky - allen diagram @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , i.e. when the charge transfer gap @xmath110 ( @xmath111 is @xmath112 for one hole and @xmath113 for one electron per tm site , and @xmath86 is the band width ) , the model eq.([hdp ] ) can be reduced to the effective hubbard model for @xmath78-electrons eq.([hubbard ] ) with @xmath114 .",
    "on the other hand , in the charge transfer ( ct ) insulator regime , @xmath115 , one finds new orbital exchange terms that turn out to be more important than those obtained within the hubbard model eq.([hubbard ] ) ( see the discussion below ) .    in any case ,",
    "exchange interactions for the @xmath104-angle between the metal - oxygen bonds ( see fig.[nili ] ) are very different from eq.([gka ] ) for the @xmath90-angle . in the @xmath104-geometry",
    "the orbitals of one tm ( e.g. site @xmath29 in fig.[plaquette ] ) overlap with the @xmath116-orbital of the oxygen o1 ( see fig.[plaquette ] ) , whereas the @xmath78-orbitals of the ion @xmath23 overlap with the orthogonal @xmath117-orbital of the same oxygen . due to the orthogonality of these two oxygen orbitals , it is impossible to transfer a @xmath78-electron from one tm ion to another via oxygens , and this is the principal difference from the @xmath90-exchange .",
    "the only processes allowed are the transfers of oxygen electrons to the site @xmath29 ( from the @xmath116-orbital ) followed by the transfer of another electron from the @xmath117-orbital of this oxygen to the the tm site @xmath23 .",
    "if we first ignore the hund s rule coupling on oxygens , these processes are independent of spins of @xmath78-electrons , i.e. , they do not result in a spin exchange .",
    "however , they do depend on the orbital occupation of the two tm ions , resulting in an orbital exchange . therefore , for this geometry , the spin and orbital interactions are decoupled , the orbital exchange being much stronger than the spin one ( the latter @xmath118 ) . on the other hand , in the kk model eq.([gka ] ) the strongly coupled spin and orbital exchanges are of the same order .",
    "thus , the kk model , obtained for the specific case of the mh insulators with the @xmath90 metal - oxygen - metal bonds , should not be used uncritically for other situations .",
    "the crystal structure of linio@xmath101 .",
    "the sublattice of ni ions consists of triangular [ 111 ] layers ( shaded).,width=188 ]    these general considerations are confirmed by detailed calculations @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the plaquette formed by two oxygens and two tm ions on the sites @xmath29 and @xmath23 in the @xmath119 plane ( see fig.[plaquette ] ) the orbital exchange interaction is given by @xmath120 , \\label{ht}\\ ] ] where @xmath121 and the coupled spin - dependent exchange is @xmath122    several points have to be stressed here .",
    "first of all , we indeed see that the orbital exchange is stronger than the spin one ( usually @xmath123ev and both @xmath124 and @xmath111 are @xmath125ev , so that @xmath126 ) .",
    "the spin exchange only appears due to the hund s rule coupling ( in this case on oxygen ) and is always _",
    "ferromagnetic _ , independent of the orbital occupation .",
    "therefore , the spin ordering on this triangular lattice is not frustrated .",
    "this , in particular , invalidates the attempts to describe linio@xmath101 as a spin liquid of the rvb type @xcite .",
    "the second point is the presence of two terms with opposite signs in the expression for orbital exchange eq.([ht ] ) .",
    "the origin of these terms is rather interesting .",
    "the negative term resembles those obtained in the hubbard model : it describes the virtual process with two holes on one oxygen in the intermediate state , which is why it contains @xmath127 in the denominator .",
    "the positive term , however , is of a different nature - it remains nonzero even when @xmath128 .",
    "its origin can be understood as follows : the virtual hopping of @xmath78-electrons from a tm site to @xmath129 surrounding oxygens results in an energy decrease .",
    "however , each oxygen belongs to two different octahedra . for infinite @xmath124",
    "this leads to blocking of some of these charge fluctuations : when e.g. the oxygen @xmath130 in fig.[plaquette ] is occupied by the hole from the site @xmath29 , it blocks the virtual hole transfer from the site @xmath23 .",
    "this blocking reduces the total energy gain due to the charge fluctuations and gives rise to an effective orbital exchange interaction , since an amount by which the energy is reduced depends on orbital occupations on the sites @xmath29 and @xmath23 .",
    "this mechanism of exchange is similar to the casimir interaction between two metallic plates in vacuum .",
    "the overlap between the @xmath78-orbitals of the tm sites @xmath29 and @xmath23 and with two different @xmath131-orbitals of oxygen @xmath130 for the @xmath104-exchange.,width=264 ]    while the hubbard model gives an effective interaction , which respects the electron - hole symmetry , in the d - p model this symmetry is lost . in particular , for one hole per tm site the effective orbital interaction the form @xmath132 , \\label{hthole}\\ ] ] ( cf .",
    "eq.([ht ] ) for one electron per site ) . in this case",
    "the effect of blocking is minimized when the @xmath78-hole orbital on at least one site is not directed towards the common oxygen , e.g. @xmath18-orbital on the site @xmath23 in fig.[180]b and @xmath19-orbital on the site @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the orbital interaction eq.([hthole ] ) favors hole orbitals directed away from the common oxygens , in contrast to the situation in mh insulators ( see eq.([gka ] ) ) , for which the energetically most favorable occupation is shown in fig.[180]a .    if we now consider the exchange hamiltonian for the whole triangular lattice , we find out that here too the interactions in different directions compete .",
    "the outcome is again that in the mean - field approximation the ground state is strongly degenerate .",
    "the orbital exchange on a triangular lattice is strongly frustrated and has a large number of mean - field ground states , including ferro - orbital states , in which @xmath133 on all lattice sites , where @xmath134 is an arbitrary unit vector in the @xmath59-plane .",
    "furthermore , there are disordered ground states , which can be obtained from the ferro - orbital states by , e.g. , inverting the sign of @xmath135 on an arbitrarily selected set of lines parallel to the lines with the @xmath136 type of exchange ( see fig .  [ triang ] ) . such states are ordered along the lines , but there are no long - range correlations between the @xmath43-projections of pseudospins in the transverse direction ( as in the compass model discussed in sec .",
    "[ compass ] ) . by circular permutations of the @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath25 indices one can obtain similar states , which are only ordered along the two other sets of lines in the triangular lattice .",
    "the spectrum of orbital excitations for , e.g. , @xmath137 , calculated in the ( pseudo)spin - wave approximation for @xmath138 , is given by @xmath139 as in the case of the compass model discussed in sec .",
    "[ compass ] , the excitation spectrum is gapless and it is independent of one of the projection of momentum ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "this one - dimensional spectrum leads to divergent fluctuations , to remove which , one has to go beyond the ( pseudo)spin - wave approximation and take into account interactions between the orbital excitations .",
    "one obtains then that the order - from - disorder mechanism chooses 6 particular ferroorbital ground states , e.g. @xmath94 ( all @xmath141 ) @xcite and that the spectrum of elementary excitations acquires the gap @xmath142 , makes the orbital fluctuations finite .     a disordered mean - field ground state , in which the pseudospins form lines parallel to the unit vector @xmath143 , such that @xmath144 is the same on all lattice sites , while the sign of @xmath135 varies arbitrarily from line to line.,width=264",
    "]    we note that the ` geometric ' frustration of the triangular lattice plays an important role in this story .",
    "one can show @xcite that , in contrast to the `` compass '' model , an ordering of @xmath5 orbitals on a square lattice is not frustrated .",
    "thus in two dimensions , both the anisotropy of the orbital exchange and the special geometry of the triangular lattice are necessary for frustration . in a similar way one can treat other types of ` frustrated ' lattices . for instance ,",
    "effective interactions eqs.([ht ] ) and ( [ eq : hts ] ) can be used to describe exchange on the pyrochlore lattice of tm ions , since the local geometry of metal - oxygen - metal bonds is the same as in linio@xmath101 .",
    "also the orbital excitations for the @xmath60 ferro - orbital state on the pyrochlore lattice only propagate along two disconnected sets of bonds with the @xmath136-type of exchange , similarly to the case of the triangular lattice .    applying the d - p model to systems with the @xmath90-exchange path , one can show that the ` orbital casimir ' interactions also exist in these systems @xcite .",
    "they have the form similar to the phonon - mediated interactions eq.([isocompass ] ) and modify the standard kk description . in charge transfer",
    "insulators these terms dominate the exchange , resulting in the decoupling of orbital and spin orderings and forcing orbitals to order at higher temperatures than spins , provided that the frustration of the orbital interactions is somehow lifted .",
    "summarizing , we have discussed orbital interactions and frustration of orbital ordering in different physical situations .",
    "we showed that due to the directional nature of the hopping amplitudes the orbital exchange is frustrated even for simple ( perovskite ) lattices .",
    "frustration is therefore a generic property of orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "if in addition we are dealing with the systems with the ` geometric ' frustration , the ground state degeneracy becomes even stronger .",
    "the resulting type of the orbital , and spin , structure of the ground state can then be determined either by small corrections to the exchange interactions lifting this degeneracy , e.g. the hund s rule coupling or small `` external '' splitting of degenerate @xmath5-levels due to deviations from the perfect cubic symmetry .",
    "another possibility is an ordering due to the order - from - disorder mechanism , discussed above .",
    "we note , however , that this semiclassical mechanism , strictly speaking , works for large values of pseudospin @xmath138 , when quantum fluctuations are relatively small .",
    "since in reality @xmath145 , strong quantum fluctuations may still result in a disordered ground state .",
    "such a quantum orbital liquid remains an intriguing possibility .",
    "the situation with other types of orbitally - degenerate systems , e.g. materials with three - fold degenerate @xmath6-orbitals , may have its own peculiarities @xcite .",
    "first of all , due to a larger degeneracy and a weaker coupling to the lattice , one may expect stronger frustration and stronger quantum effects , which could result in an orbital - liquid ground state @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "as we already mentioned in the introduction , in @xmath6-systems the spin - orbital interaction may play an important role , which may remove the orbital degeneracy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in frustrated lattices ( of the type considered in sec .",
    "[ 90 ] ) of @xmath6-ions , one has to take into account not only the exchange between the ions via oxygens , but also direct the @xmath146 overlaps across the tm - oxygen plaquettes ( see fig.[plaquette ] )",
    ". what would be the resulting orbital structure with all these effects taken into account , is still an open problem .",
    "we see , that the orbital physics , especially in materials with complex lattices , is very rich and can still produce many surprises ."
