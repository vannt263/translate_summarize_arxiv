    "at the tevatron collider bunches of protons and antiprotons are accelerated and collided at an energy of @xmath1  tev .",
    "the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) and d   detectors have collected large samples of data . here , we present some of the latest results from the cdf experiment .",
    "data were collected during two periods : run 1a groups about 20  pb@xmath3 and run 1b about 90  pb@xmath3 , for a total period of time that goes from 1992 until the end of 1995 .",
    "the cdf detector  @xcite relies on a high resolution tracking system with a central tracking drift chamber immersed in a 1.4 tesla magnetic field .",
    "in addition , a high precision silicon micro - vertex detector was added inside the drift chamber and near the beam  pipe to allow for precise vertex determination . outside the tracking system ,",
    "electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters provide excellent measurement of particle energy .",
    "muon chambers located outside the magnetic yoke complete the tracking system .",
    "the results presented here include the direct measurement of the cp violation parameter of @xmath2 .",
    "recently , the cdf collaboration also improved the measurement of the @xmath4production cross section , and continues the investigation for new physics , including higgs boson and susy searches .",
    "we conclude the paper and highlight the improved capabilities in run ii , and summarize the upgrade projects under construction for the cdf detector .",
    "the origin of cp violation has been an outstanding problem since its first discovery in @xmath5 decays . after 35 years of the discovery of cp violation ,",
    "the kaon system was still the only place where cp violation had been observed .",
    "however , neutral b mesons are expected to yield large cp violating effects . here",
    ", we report on a direct measurement that indicates a cp violation effect in @xmath6 decays .",
    "cp violation can be explained in an elegant way in the standard model ( sm ) with three generations , as suggested by cabibbo , kobayashi and maskawa  @xcite .",
    "they proposed that quark mixing is the cause .",
    "the ckm matrix relates the mass and weak eigenstates of the quarks . with three generations of quarks",
    ", the ckm matrix has a physical complex phase capable of accommodating cp violation .",
    "similar to the kaon system , cp violating effects are expected in @xmath7 mesons .",
    "the effects of cp violation in the inclusive decay channels of the @xmath7 mesons are still too small ( @xmath8 ) to be detected  @xcite . yet",
    ", the interference due to mixing of @xmath9 decays to the same cp state could show large violations .",
    "cp violation can manifest itself as an asymmetry in the decay rate of particle versus anti - particle to a particular cp eigenstate .",
    "for example , a @xmath9 may decay directly to @xmath10 , or it may oscillate to a @xmath11 and then decay to @xmath10 .",
    "the two paths have a phase difference and the interference results in an asymmetry :    @xmath12 where @xmath13 @xmath14 $ ] is the number of @xmath10 decays at proper time @xmath15 from mesons produced as @xmath9 @xmath16 $ ] , and @xmath17 is the mixing oscillation due to the decay interference . in the sm ,",
    "the cp asymmetry is proportional to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is an angle of the unitarity triangle . in order to measure the asymmetry",
    "@xmath20 we have to identify the flavor of the b meson at the time of production .",
    "the tagging algorithms are not perfect , and the `` true '' asymmetry is `` diluted '' by a dilution factor ( @xmath21 ) that takes into account the `` mistakes '' of the tagging algorithms , which incorrectly identify the flavor .",
    "the dilution factor is defined as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the probability to have a correct tag .",
    "therefore , the observed asymmetry @xmath24 , is reduced by the dilution parameter .",
    "we take advantage of the large @xmath7 meson production cross section at the tevatron , and use a sample of @xmath10 decays to measure @xmath18 .",
    "this measurement uses a data sample which is larger by a factor of two with respect to our previous measurement @xcite by including @xmath10 events not reconstructed in the svx . here ,",
    "in addition to the tagging algorithm which we previously used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we also employ two additional tagging algorithms which further enlarge the effective statistical power our sample size .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath25 events similarly to previous analyses at cdf .",
    "then , we categorize the events according to the tagging algorithm used .",
    "we measure dilutions and efficiencies for each class of events and use a maximum likelihood fitting procedure to extract the result for @xmath18 .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath26 events decaying to @xmath27 .",
    "we identify @xmath28 candidates by reconstructing oppositely charged tracks to the @xmath29 hypothesis .",
    "we constrain the @xmath27 and @xmath30 pairs to the world average masses . the reconstructed invariant mass of the @xmath31 system for all the candidates is shown in figure  [ sin2beta_sample ] .",
    "about one half ( 202@xmath3218 events as opposed to 193@xmath3226 events ) of the final @xmath33 signal sample contains a precise lifetime information as both muons are contained in the silicon vertex detector ( svx ) .",
    "the precise lifetime information allows us to make a time ",
    "dependent measurement of the oscillation .",
    "we can also use the events that are not contained within the svx acceptance . in this case ,",
    "cp asymmetry is still present in the form of a time  integrated measurement .",
    "the statistical power is only reduced by a factor of one third in our non ",
    "svx sample , where the lifetime information is lost .",
    "the measurement of @xmath34 is possible if we can determine the flavor ( @xmath7 or @xmath35 ) of the @xmath7 meson at the time of production .",
    "a tagging method with dilution @xmath21 and tagging efficiency @xmath36 yields an uncertainty on @xmath18 which scales as 1/@xmath37 , with @xmath38 events .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 measures the effective tagging power .",
    "here , we use a combination of different tagging methods .",
    "we use three taggers .",
    "we use a same side tagger ( sst ) , which relies on selecting a track ( supposedly from a @xmath40 ) near the @xmath7 meson , and it is correlated to the @xmath41flavor  @xcite .",
    "the sst tag is a candidate track with a @xmath42 mev / c , reconstructed in the svx .",
    "the sst tagger was used in our earlier measurement of @xmath18 .",
    "the sst dilution is measured to be @xmath43 in the @xmath10 sample , for events reconstructed in the svx . here , we extend the sst algorithm to events outside the svx coverage ( we drop the impact parameter cut ) , and we find a dilution factor of @xmath44 .    in order to further increase the effective number of candidate events , we use two additional taggers that determine the flavor of the `` other '' @xmath7 meson ; we can also refer to them as `` opposite side taggers '' .",
    "we use the soft lepton tagger ( slt ) which determines the charge of the lepton from the @xmath45 decay  @xcite .",
    "lepton tracks have a @xmath46  gev / c@xmath47 for electrons ( muons ) .",
    "the dilution is measured from @xmath48 sample and we find @xmath49 .",
    "the other opposite side tagger is a jet charge ( jetq ) tagger  @xcite .",
    "the flavor is determined by a measure of the average of the charge of the opposite side jet .",
    "the jet is formed by an algorithm that combines tracks ( @xmath50  gev / c ) around a seed track with @xmath51  gev / c , up to the mass of the @xmath7 . the dilution again is measured from @xmath48 sample , and is @xmath52 .    in general , the ideal tagger should have high dilution and high efficiency .",
    "in reality , the slt tagger has high dilution but low efficiency , while both sst and jetq taggers have higher efficiency and low dilution values . by coincidence ,",
    "all of the three taggers measured @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , we have effectively tripled the size of our event sample with respect to  @xcite . the combined @xmath39 for the three taggers is @xmath54 . in conclusion",
    ", our sample of 400 events corresponds to @xmath55 perfectly tagged @xmath10 events .",
    "we use a negative log  likelihood method to determine the best value for @xmath18 . the @xmath56 lifetime and the @xmath57 values",
    "are fixed to the world average values ( 1.54@xmath320.04 psec and 0.464@xmath320.018 psec@xmath3 ) .",
    "the fit yields a value @xmath58 ( stat .",
    "+ syst . ) for all the taggers combined  @xcite . in figure  [ sin2beta_result ]",
    "we show the distributions of the asymmetry both for the svx and for the non  svx samples .",
    "the precision of our direct measurement of @xmath59 is still dominated by the statistical uncertainty ( @xmath320.36 ) .",
    "this measurement provides for the first time an indication of cp violation in the @xmath7 system , and it is consistent with the sm expectations .",
    "definite observation of cp violation in the @xmath7 mesons requires a better precision . in run",
    "ii , with an integrated luminosity of @xmath60  fb@xmath3 , we expect to reconstruct @xmath61 from dimuons , which will give a total uncertainty of about @xmath62 .",
    "triggering on @xmath63 may increase the sample by 50% .",
    "cdf is also upgrading the detector with a time  of  flight system which will help flavor identification .",
    "at the tevatron top quarks are produced mainly in pairs , via @xmath64 annihilation , with a theoretically expected cross section of only about 5  pb  @xcite .",
    "after several years of data taking during run i , only about 600 @xmath4 events were produced .",
    "when we fold in the geometrical acceptances , identification criteria and selection requirements , the data set becomes much smaller .    in the framework of the sm each top quark decays into a @xmath65 and a @xmath41 quark .",
    "the final state of a @xmath4decay therefore has two @xmath65 bosons and two @xmath41 quarks .",
    "direct evidence of the existence of the top quark was presented by cdf  @xcite in early 1994 .",
    "later , in 1995 , both the cdf and the d   collaborations announced conclusive discovery of the top quark  @xcite .",
    "a key to the identification of @xmath4events has proved to be the ability to _ tag _ the @xmath41 quarks .",
    "tagging of @xmath41 quarks can be achieved at cdf using the silicon micro - vertex detector ( svx ) , and we can attain a @xmath41 tagging efficiency of about @xmath66 in a @xmath4event , by finding a secondary vertex from the interaction point ( svx tagging ) . also , we can identify @xmath41 quarks by means of a lepton ( @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) from @xmath41 decays , with an efficiency of @xmath69 .",
    "this method is referred to as soft lepton tagger ( slt ) .",
    "we measure the @xmath4production cross section in several decay channels and all the channels yield consistent results .",
    "a final result is obtained by combining the cross sections in the individual channels .    in this paper",
    "we report on an improved measurement of the @xmath4cross section in the `` lepton+jets '' channel , where one @xmath65 decays leptonically and the other @xmath65 decays hadronically . here",
    ", we identify the @xmath41 quarks through the svx tagging method .",
    "this yields our most precise determination of the @xmath4cross section in a single channel . in the data",
    "selection we require the presence of one lepton ( @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) , a large value of @xmath70 ( @xmath71  gev ) , and at least 3 jets with @xmath72  gev and @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "the dominant backgrounds come from @xmath74jets production and qcd multi",
    " jet processes .",
    "the selection criteria are identical to what is described in ref .",
    "@xcite , with a few exceptions .    here",
    ", we outline the improvement used in this measurement and the differences with the previous result . the main difference in our measurement",
    "consists of a revised determination of the efficiency of the svx tagging algorithm .",
    "we measure the tagging efficiency in the data and in simulated events .",
    "the previous result used a method which determined the @xmath41tagging efficiency using a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation , tuned to give the same track finding efficiency as in the data .",
    "the new method directly compares the @xmath41tagging efficiencies in low  p@xmath75 inclusive electron samples ( rich in heavy flavor ) from data and from simulation .",
    "we find that there is no e@xmath75 dependence of the data  to ",
    "mc @xmath41tagging efficiency ratio , alleviating previous concerns about extrapolating the results from low e@xmath75 jets in the inclusive electron samples to jets in top events .",
    "also , the run i svx @xmath41tagging efficiency for a @xmath4event has increased from @xmath76  43% to @xmath76  50% .",
    "most of the difference is due to outdated @xmath41lifetimes previously used in the mc , outdated @xmath7 and @xmath21 branching ratios , and slight inconsistencies in the modeling of the svx geometry . among other improvements",
    ", we use a slightly different event selection where we measure jet energies and @xmath70 with the z  vertex of the primary lepton , instead of the center of the detector . also , we have a better selection of candidates from @xmath77 bosons .",
    "the new selection finds about 20% more real @xmath77 s and rejects about 20% less fake @xmath77 s .",
    "we use a new method to calculate mistags that uses a parameterization of the negative tagging rate from all jet data after corrections for heavy flavor contribution to the negative tags .",
    "the associated uncertainty is 10% ( instead of 40% ) .",
    "the rate of @xmath78  jets events is shown in figure  [ w_plus_njets ] .",
    "we compute the @xmath4production cross section from the excess of events with at least one @xmath41tag in the @xmath79  jets sample .",
    "the whole excess is attributed to @xmath4events . in 105.1@xmath324.0",
    "pb@xmath3 of data we find 29 @xmath80  3 jet events with an expected background contribution of 8.0@xmath321.0 events .",
    "the resulting new value of the top cross section in the lepton+jets channel using the svx tagging algorithm is 5.1@xmath321.5 pb .",
    "we use the new value for the @xmath41tagging efficiency , and apply the needed modifications to the calculation of the cross section values in the other decay channels .",
    "then , we combine the results from the `` lepton+jets '' channel ( including slt ) with the updated results from the dilepton and from the all  hadronic channels .",
    "we use a likelihood procedure , where we take into account the correlations between the backgrounds .",
    "the new result yields a combined @xmath4production cross section of @xmath81  pb , which can be compared to our previous value of @xmath82  pb .",
    "the sm provides a simple mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking through the introduction of a scalar field doublet .",
    "the doublet has one single observable scalar particle , the higgs boson , with an unknown mass but with fixed couplings to other particles . at the tevatron one",
    "is more likely to observe the wh and zh production processes .",
    "in fact , although the higgs production cross section from gluon  gluon fusion ( @xmath83 ) is larger ( by a factor of @xmath84 for a higgs mass of 100 gev / c@xmath47  @xcite ) than the associated production of @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , the decay products from @xmath87 are difficult to disentangle from the di  jet qcd background . instead , when the higgs is produced in association with a @xmath88 boson , we can use the presence of an additional lepton or additional jets ( possibly from @xmath89 or @xmath77 ) to discriminate from background sources and use the @xmath41tagging algorithm to identify @xmath41jets from @xmath90 events .",
    "the tevatron is mostly sensitive in the region for @xmath91 gev / c@xmath47  @xcite , where the branching ratio of @xmath92 is dominant .",
    "we study various channels with different signatures in the final state .",
    "we search for the sm higgs in the lepton+jets channel , in @xmath93 events .",
    "we look for an isolated high@xmath94 lepton @xmath95 to identify @xmath65 decays or pairs of leptons to identify @xmath96 decays , and jets with @xmath41 tags to identify the @xmath90 decays .",
    "we also search for the higgs in multi - jet events with @xmath97 jets ( @xmath98 ) , of which at least two jets are @xmath41tagged .",
    "finally , we look for signatures with large @xmath70 from the process @xmath99 . in this analysis",
    "we start with a @xmath70 data sample ( with @xmath100  gev ) and require at least 2 @xmath41tagged jets .",
    "we observe no deviations from the known sm backgrounds , in any of these final states .",
    "therefore , we combine the results from the different channels and obtain an upper limit on higgs production . figure  [ higgs_limits ] shows the 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit results on @xmath101 .",
    "the results indicate that the measurements at the tevatron are not yet sensitive to the discovery of the sm higgs , due to the small number of expected events .",
    "we have studied the feasibility of sm higgs search in run ii .",
    "we expect to improve our @xmath41tagging capabilities , due to an increased acceptance  @xcite of our micro - vertex detector , by about 50% in events with single @xmath41 tagging .",
    "also in the future , the improvement of the di  jet mass resolution will be crucial for observing the higgs boson .",
    "therefore , we have studied a new algorithm for improving the jet energy resolution in the run i data sample .",
    "we have measured an improvement of more than 25% as compared to our standard algorithm for single jet energy resolution , in a photon+jet sample ( see figure  [ jet_resolution ] ) . in di ",
    "jet events we could expect an improvement on the di  jet mass resolution of an additional factor of @xmath102 .",
    "we combine results from the cdf and d   experiments at the tevatron as well as several channels .",
    "we include @xmath103 and @xmath104 channels with the higgs decaying into @xmath105 pairs for a higgs mass below 130 gev , while for a higher mass the @xmath106 decay has also been considered .",
    "figure  [ higgs_run2 ] shows the expectations once we include a better di@xmath41  jet mass resolution and the new detector acceptance .",
    "the integrated luminosity needed per experiment for a 5@xmath107 and 3@xmath107 discovery , and 95@xmath108 c.l .",
    "limit is plotted as a function of the sm higgs mass .",
    "instead , if we use the present di  jet mass resolution , the luminosity needed to achieve the same results approximately doubles .      the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm )  @xcite is a further extension of the sm . in the mssm ,",
    "a more complex symmetry breaking mechanism occurs .",
    "five observable scalar particles are predicted : two charged ( @xmath109 ) and three neutral ( @xmath110 , and @xmath111 ) higgs bosons . in the enlarged higgs sector two new parameters are introduced : @xmath112 which is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , and the higgs mass parameter @xmath68 .    at the tevatron , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , can be produced similarly to sm higgs . in the mssm , at large values of @xmath112 , the higgs couplings to @xmath113 and @xmath114 pairs",
    "are greatly enhanced .",
    "the coupling is approximately proportional to   @xmath115 .",
    "this results in a large production cross section in @xmath116 events ( the same would happen for production in association with @xmath113 pairs ) . at cdf",
    "we have searched for events with @xmath97 jets ( of which @xmath117  @xmath41tagged jets ) in the final state .",
    "the number of events found in the data is in good agreement with the expected backgrounds ( mainly from qcd events , from mistags , and from @xmath118 ) .",
    "we can set a 95%  c.l .",
    "limit on the mass of mssm neutral higgs as a function of @xmath112 .",
    "these results are preliminary and not presented at the time of this conference .    in the charged higgs sector instead , we have sensitivity at low values of @xmath112 where @xmath119 , and at large values of @xmath112 where @xmath120 .",
    "we presented results on direct and indirect higgs production from top quark decays @xmath121 , in both regions of @xmath112 .",
    "we do not find any anomalous excess of events over the expected background and set a limit on higgs production .",
    "results have not changed since  @xcite .",
    "+ at large values of @xmath112 , we can also use the results from a search for top quark pair production in the e@xmath122+jets and @xmath123+jets signatures  @xcite . here , we exploit the competing decays @xmath121 and @xmath124 , when @xmath125 . in the region at large values of @xmath112 the @xmath126 yukawa coupling may become non  perturbative ( see ref .",
    "therefore we choose to use a parameter ",
    "independent space to determine the excluded region .",

    "the @xmath128 lepton is detected through its 1prong and 3prong hadronic decays .",
    "the range and complexity of susy signatures is growing fast . in the analysis of run",
    "i data it has become evident that the use of heavy flavor tagging is gaining importance and it has become crucial . here",
    ", we present the results from a recent analysis which searches for scalar quarks in events with @xmath129+jets .",
    "the signature comes from the decays of the supersymmetric particles decaying to jets and to neutralinos .",
    "we look for scalar top ( @xmath130 ) and for scalar bottom ( @xmath131 ) quarks in events with similar final states  @xcite .",
    "we search for the scalar top quark in events with large @xmath70 and with a pair of heavy flavor jets , from the decay @xmath132 .",
    "we assume that the neutralino @xmath133 is the lightest supersymmetric particle and it is stable . from a data sample of 88  pb@xmath3 , we select events with two or three jets , no leptons , and with @xmath134  gev .",
    "the requirement of large @xmath70 eliminates almost completely the qcd di  jet background .",
    "we require that @xmath70 is neither parallel nor anti - parallel to any jet direction in order to suppress contributions from qcd events where missing energy comes from jet energy mismeasurement .",
    "we use a `` jet probability '' ( jp ) algorithm to tag jets with a heavy flavor content .",
    "the jp algorithm relies on determining a probability that a jet originates from a secondary vertex , and it is optimized for charm or bottom selection in stop or sbottom searches .",
    "the probability that the tracks in a jet come from the primary vertex is flat and distributed between 0 and 1 for tracks originating from the primary vertex , and peaks at zero for tracks from a secondary vertex .",
    "the efficiency of the jp algorithm to tag charm quarks is checked in a charm enriched sample , with @xmath135 and @xmath136 mesons . in our final data sample",
    "we find 11 events consistent with an expected background of 14.5@xmath324.2 events from sm sources .",
    "we interpret the null result in the scalar top search as an excluded region in @xmath137 versus @xmath138 parameter space using a background subtraction method  @xcite .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "limit excluded region is shown in figure  [ stop_limits ] .",
    "also , as we mentioned earlier , we can use similar selection criteria and search for scalar bottom quarks in the decay channel @xmath139 .",
    "after we apply our final selection cuts , we find 5 events in the data sample , with an expected background from sm sources of 5.8@xmath321.8 events .",
    "figure  [ sbottom_limits ] shows the 95% c.l .",
    "limit in the @xmath140 versus @xmath138 plane .",
    "we have presented some of the latest results obtained at cdf during run i. still , four years after the end of run i , many analyses are being completed and many are still in progress . in run ii , both the cdf and the d   detectors will be much more powerful , with much improved vertex detectors and tracking system which allow for larger acceptance and for higher efficiency in flavor tagging",
    ". the new upgraded detectors will collect more data at a higher energy of @xmath141  tev . at this energy , the production cross section of heavy particles in the susy zoo for example , will increase significantly . furthermore , with a factor of 20 in expected delivered luminosity during run ii , the experiments at the tevatron will have a great chance to shed light into the new world of `` new physics '' .",
    "most importantly , by extending run ii up to an integrated luminosity of about 20  fb@xmath3 and combining search channels , the tevatron can perform a crucial test of the mssm higgs boson sector .",
    "the @xmath65 and top quark mass measurements , from the tevatron ( both from cdf and from d  ) and from the lep2 experiments , suggest a small value for the higgs boson mass ( see figure  [ sm_higgs_run2 ] ) .",
    "also , most theories predict a higgs mass which is comprised between 130 and 150 gev / c@xmath47 .",
    "when combining these informations together , the picture looks promising for the higgs searches at the tevatron during run ii . the experience gained from run i analyses will greatly increase the quality of the run ii searches .",
    "new triggering capabilities will open previously inaccessible channels . in conclusion",
