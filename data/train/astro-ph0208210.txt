    "although of fundamental importance to stellar astrophysics , precise measurements of angular radii are generically difficult to acquire routinely and in a model - independent way .",
    "classical direct methods of measuring stellar radii include lunar occultations , interferometry , and eclipsing binaries .",
    "lunar occultation measurements yield precise angular radii ( see richichi et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) , but the number of stars to which this technique can be applied is limited .",
    "the number of direct measurements using interferometers has recently increased dramatically with advent of , e.g.  the palomar testbed interferometer ( van belle et al .  1999a , colavita et al .",
    "1999 ) , and the navy prototype optical interferometer ( armstrong et al .",
    "1998 , nordgren et al .  1999 ) , and is likely to continue to increase as more technologically advanced interferometers come online .",
    "unfortunately , both lunar occultation and interferometric angular diameter measurements have traditionally been primarily limited to nearby , evolved stars .",
    "angular radii of main - sequence stars can be determined using detached eclipsing binaries ( i.e.  popper 1998 ) , however the large amount of data ( both photometric and spectroscopic ) required to yield accurate radii determinations makes this method prohibitive .",
    "thus , of the @xmath17 direct , precise angular diameter measurements compiled by van belle ( 1999 ) , the overwhelming majority , @xmath18 , are of evolved stars . finally , it will be difficult to acquire a large sample of angular radii determinations of stars with metallicity considerably smaller than solar using these methods , due to the paucity of metal - poor stars in the local neighborhood .    here",
    "we present a method , based on a suggestion by paczyski ( 1998 ) , of measuring angular radii of stars that overcomes some of the difficulties inherent in the classical methods .",
    "this method employs the extraordinary angular resolution provided by caustics in gravitational microlensing events , and as such is yet another in the growing list of applications of microlensing to the study of stellar astrophysics ( see gould 2001 for a review ) .",
    "the original suggestion of paczyski ( 1998 ) was to invert the method of gould ( 1994 ) for measuring the relative source - lens proper motion @xmath19 in microlensing events .",
    "if the lens transits the source in a microlensing event , precise photometry can be used to determine the time it takes for the lens to transit one source radius , @xmath20 , where @xmath1 is angular radius of the source .",
    "an estimate of @xmath1 , using an empirical color - surface brightness relation , together with a measurement of the flux of the source , can then be used to estimate @xmath19 , which gould ( 1994 ) argued could be used to constrain the location of the lens . however , as paczyski ( 1998 ) pointed out , it is possible to independently measure the angular einstein ring radius of the lens , @xmath21 by making precise astrometric measurements of the centroid shift of the source during the microlensing event using , i.e. , the _ space interferometry mission _ ( sim ) . here",
    "@xmath22 is the mass of the lens , @xmath23 is defined by , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the distances between the observer - source , observer - lens , and lens - source , respectively . since @xmath28 , by combining the measurement of @xmath5 with the einstein timescale @xmath3 of the event determined from the light curve , it is possible to measure @xmath1 for the source stars of microlensing events .",
    "we show that , with reasonable expenditure of resources , it should be possible to measure angular radii of a significant sample ( @xmath29 ) of giant stars in the bulge to an accuracy of @xmath30 , or @xmath10 main - sequence stars to an accuracy of @xmath31 .",
    "limb - darkening determinations should also be possible for the majority of the sources , and most will be relatively metal poor as compared to those for which angular radii determinations are currently available .    although measurements of @xmath1 can be made using single - lens events , in  [ sec : bvs ] we argue that this method is better suited to caustic - crossing binary - lens events , which are more common , easier to plan for , and considerably less resource - intensive than source - crossing single - lens events .",
    "we describe in some detail the basic method of measuring @xmath1 for the source stars of caustic - crossing binary - lens events in  [ sec : method ] , including a discussion of the expected errors on the individual parameters that enter into the measurement .",
    "we discuss various subtleties , complications , and extensions to the method in  [ sec : discussion ] , and also present an estimate of the number of @xmath1 measurements that might be made in this way .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the primary requirement to be able to measure @xmath5 in a microlensing event is that the source should be resolved by the gravitational lens .",
    "this effectively means that the source must cross a caustic in the source plane .",
    "caustics are the set of positions in the source plane where the determinant of the jacobian of the lens mapping from source to lens plane vanishes , and where the magnification therefore is formally infinite .",
    "large gradients ( with respect to source position ) in the magnification exist near caustics , enabling the resolution of the source .",
    "generically , microlenses come in two classes : single and binary lenses . here",
    "` binary lens ' means a lens systems composed of two masses with angular separation of order the angular einstein ring radius of the system . very close and",
    "very wide binaries act essentially as single lenses .",
    "single lenses have a caustic that consists of a single point at the position of the lens . in these cases , the magnification close to the caustic diverges as the inverse of the distance to the caustic .",
    "in contrast , the caustics of binary lenses are extended , and can cover a significant fraction of the einstein ring .",
    "the caustics of binary lenses generically consist of two types of singularities , folds and cusps .. however , folds and cusps are the only stable singularities of any lens system ( petters , levine , & wambsganss 2000 ) .",
    "beak - to - beak singularities are unstable in the sense that , for infinitesimally small variations in the lens parameters , a beak - to - beak singularity disintegrates into two cusp - type singularities .",
    "thus the set of parameters where beak - to - beak singularities are expected is formally sparse , and practically small .",
    "interestingly , alcock et  al .",
    "( 2000a ) suggested that an observed event may have been due to a source crossing a beak - to - beak singularity in a binary - lens , although alcock et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) seem to favor the interpretation that this event is due to a background supernova . ] near a fold , the caustic is well - described by generic linear fold singularities , for which the magnification locally diverges inversely as the square - root of the distance to the caustic ( schneider & weiss 1986 , schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 , gaudi & petters 2002a ) .",
    "cusps are points where two fold caustics meet , and the magnification for cusps locally diverges roughly inversely as the distance to the cusp point , similar to the magnification pattern near the point caustic of a single lens ( schneider & weiss 1992 , schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 , gaudi & petters 2002b ) .",
    "the fact that the magnification near the point caustic of a single lens or near a cusp diverges inversely as the distance to the singularity , rather than as the square root of the distance to the singularity as with folds , means that for a given source size , the ` resolving power ' of fold caustic crossings is less than single lens or cusp crossings .",
    "although single - lens events are more well suited to studies of stellar atmospheres , they are much less useful for measuring the sizes of stars for three main reasons .",
    "they are generally rarer than fold caustic crossings , their crossings can not be predicted in advance , and their centroid motion is more difficult to measure .",
    "caustic - crossing binaries comprise roughly @xmath32 of all events toward the galactic bulge ( alcock et  al .  2000a ; udalski et  al .  2000 ) . of the remaining @xmath33 events , which we will conservatively assume due to single lenses ,",
    "only a fraction @xmath34 will exhibit caustic crossings .",
    "therefore , the expected ratio of binary - to - single events for which the source is resolved ( and thus measurement of @xmath1 is possible ) is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the physical radius of the source , and we adopted @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 for the scaling relation on the extreme right hand side .",
    "although not overwhelming for giant sources , for main sequence sources we expect at least an order of magnitude more binary lensing events for which the source is resolved .",
    "the ratio of the number of fold - to - cusp crossings is roughly @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of cusps , which is either 6 , 8 , or 10 for a binary lens , depending primarily on @xmath42 .",
    "thus the overwhelming majority of events for which it will be possible to measure @xmath1 will be fold caustic crossing binary - lens events .",
    "binary - lens fold caustic - crossing events also have the advantage that the second caustic crossing can be predicted in advance .",
    "this is because fold caustic crossings always come in pairs , and it is typically easy to tell , even with sparse sampling , that the first caustic crossing has occurred .",
    "then more frequent sampling can be used to monitor the rise to the second caustic , in principle enabling the prediction of the time of the second crossing a day or more in advance ( jaroszy ' nski & mao 2001 ) , and allowing the marshaling of the resources necessary to obtain the dense coverage of the second crossing needed to measure the crossing time @xmath2 of the source ( see  [ sec : dt ] ) . in contrast , a single lens caustic crossing can only reliably be ` predicted ' at about the time it begins .",
    "finally , it is considerably harder to measure @xmath5 for caustic - crossing single - lens events than binary - lensing events .",
    "single lens events have a maximum absolute centroid shift relative to the unlensed source position of @xmath43 , whereas binary lensing events can exhibit large variations of size @xmath44 or more when the source crosses the caustic ( han , chung , & chang 1999 ) .",
    "therefore considerably more time will generally be required to determine @xmath5 to given accuracy for single - lens events than for binary - lens events . since the astrometric measurements essentially require the capabilities of sim ( or some similarly precious instrument ) , it is highly desirable to minimize the amount of time spent on this step .    given the above arguments , we conclude that fold caustic crossing binary lensing events are the most suitable for use in routinely measuring @xmath1 .",
    "we will therefore focus on this case for the remainder of the discussion , however we will briefly revisit single - lens and cusp - crossing events in  [ sec : cusp ] .",
    "consider a binary - lens event in which the source crosses a simple linear caustic .",
    ", and when the angle of incidence of the source trajectory to the caustic is not small .",
    "this approximation will break down when the source is large compared to the overall size of the caustic , when the source crosses near a cusp , or when the source ` straddles ' the caustic for a long time due to a small incidence angle . although it will still be possible to measure @xmath1 for such events , the relation between the observables and @xmath1 is less straightforward .",
    "we discuss such cases in  [ sec : cusp ] . ]",
    "defining @xmath2 as the ( one - half ) the time it takes for the source to completely traverse the caustic , and @xmath4 as the angle between the source trajectory and the tangent to the caustic at the crossing point , then the time for the lens to cross the angular radius of the source is @xmath45 .",
    "however , we also have that @xmath46 , where again @xmath19 is the relative source - lens proper motion . combining these expressions",
    ", we have that @xmath47 . using the definition of @xmath19",
    ", we can write the angular source radius @xmath1 as the following function of observables , @xmath48 the process of @xmath1 measurement can therefore be subdivided into three basic steps :    ( 1 ) : :    measurement of the caustic crossing timescale @xmath2 from a    single photometrically well - resolved caustic crossing .",
    "( 2 ) : :    measurement of the angle @xmath4 and timescale    @xmath3 from the global fit to the binary - lens light curve . ( 3 ) : :    measurement of the angular einstein ring radius @xmath5    using precise astrometric measurements of the source centroid .",
    "each of these steps are illustrated schematically in figure 1 .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we consider each of these steps in more detail .",
    "we outline the basic requirements for the measurement of each of the four parameters ( @xmath49 , and @xmath5 ) , and the expected accuracy with which each can be determined assuming reasonable expenditure of observing resources .",
    "when the source is interior to a binary - lens caustic , five images are created . as the source approaches a fold caustic ,",
    "two of these images brighten and merge in a characteristic way , and eventually disappear when the source completely exits the caustic .",
    "in contrast to the significant brightening of the two images associated with the fold , the remaining three images generally vary only slowly over the timescale of the crossing .",
    "all fold caustics locally have this generic behavior , and the magnification @xmath50 of the source near a caustic crossing as a function of time is typically well - fitted by the functional form ( albrow et  al .",
    "1999b ) , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the effective rise time of the caustic , which is related to the local derivatives of the lens mapping ( petters et  al.2001 , gaudi & petters 2002 ) , @xmath53 is the time when the center of the source crosses the caustic , @xmath54 is the magnification of all the images unrelated to the fold caustic at @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the slope of the magnification of these images as a function of time , and @xmath57 can be expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind ( schneider & weiss 1987 ) .",
    "note that is only formally appropriate for a simple linear fold caustic .",
    "thus , for a well - sampled fold caustic crossing , @xmath2 can be determined essentially independently of the global geometry of the event , and indeed without reference to the photometric data away from the crossing itself . in practice ,",
    "the magnification is not directly observable , but rather the flux @xmath58 as a function of time .",
    "the form for @xmath58 takes on a similar form as , but with a slightly different parameterization ( see albrow et  al .",
    "1999b ) .    equation ( [ eqn : foft ] ) assumes a uniform source .",
    "this will likely be a poor approximation in optical bands , and assuming uniform source in the presence of limb - darkening may result in a systematic underestimate of @xmath2 , and therefore @xmath1 since , the effect of limb - darkening can partially compensated for by a smaller ( dimensionless ) source size , at least for poorly - sampled light curves . however , for well - sampled caustic crossings and @xmath59 photometric accuracy , it should generally be possible to accurately measure both the source size and limb - darkening coefficient(s ) ( rhie & bennett 1999 ) .",
    "such data quality is readily achievable ; indeed , independent limb - darkening and ( dimensionless ) source size measurements have been made for the source stars of at least five microlensing events ( albrow et  al .  1999a , afonso et  al .  2000 ,",
    "albrow et  al .",
    "2000 , albrow et  al .",
    "2001 , an et  al .",
    "a generalized form of that includes simple limb - darkening can be found in albrow et  al .",
    "( 1999b ) and afonso et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) .    by fitting ( or a generalized form of it ) to the light curve near a well - sampled fold caustic crossing",
    ", one can derive the parameters @xmath60 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the parameters @xmath61 , and @xmath52 can subsequently be used to constrain the global solution to the entire light curve ( see albrow et  al .",
    "however , of primary interest here is the parameter @xmath2 , whose value is essentially independent of the global solution . see figure 1(b ) .",
    "this means that @xmath2 and the parameters determined from the global solution , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , will be essentially uncorrelated .    in order to be able to determine @xmath2 from the caustic crossing data alone",
    ", the caustic crossing must be well - sampled , so that the parameters in be well - constrained .",
    "practically , this requires forewarning of the caustic crossing .",
    "fortunately , this is generally possible with only photometry available from the collaborations which survey the galactic bulge and find the alert the microlensing events real - time ( eros , afonso et  al .",
    "2001 ; moa , bond et  al .  2001",
    "; ogle , udalski et  al .",
    "2000 , woziak et  al .  2001 ) , although improved predictions would be possible with continuous photometry ( jaroszy ' nski & mao 2001 ) .",
    "thus no additional resources need to be invested to predict caustic crossings . however , as we discuss in  [ sec : teandphi ] , some additional sampling of the overall light curve may be needed to constrain @xmath3 and @xmath4 and determine a unique global solution .",
    "the accuracy with which @xmath2 can be determined for a given caustic crossing will depend not only on the intrinsic parameters of the caustic crossing , but also on the sampling rate and photometric accuracy near the caustic crossing , which in turn will depend on weather , blending , etc . , which tend to vary in a stochastic manner . therefore it is not very useful to attempt to quantify the expected errors on @xmath2 for an idealized observing setup .",
    "however we can obtain an order - of - magnitude estimate for @xmath62 by examining measurements of @xmath2 from published analyses of observed caustic - crossing events .",
    "we discuss these determinations more thoroughly in ",
    "[ sec : errors ] .",
    "typically , well - covered caustic crossings yield fractional errors of @xmath63 .",
    "the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 are determined from the global solution to the overall geometry of the binary - lens light curve .",
    "the relationship between the salient features of an observed light curve , and the canonical parameters of a binary - lensing event , are generally not obvious or straightforward .",
    "this fact generally makes fitting an observed light curve , and thus inferring the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , quite difficult ( see albrow et  al .",
    "1999b for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "although many methods have been proposed to overcome these difficulties , the lack of obvious correspondence between these parameters of interest and the light curve morphology generally implies that it is difficult to make general statements about the kinds of observations that are needed to reliably measure @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "however , we can make some generic comments .",
    "for caustic - crossing binary lenses , one potential observable is the time @xmath64 between caustic crossings . between caustic crossings ,",
    "the magnification is typically considerably larger than outside the caustic , and therefore even with sparse ( @xmath65 day ) sampling , it should be possible to determine to reasonable precision the time of the first caustic crossing , provided that data exist before the first crossing .",
    "the requisite photometry will generally be acquired by the survey collaboration(s ) .",
    "once the binary - lens event is alerted , more frequent photometry can be acquired by follow - up collaborations ( planet , albrow et  al .",
    "1998 ; mps , rhie et  al .",
    "2000 ) , thus mapping the `` u''-shaped curve between the caustic crossings .",
    "this shape , combined with information from cusp - approaches ( or lack thereof ) just outside the caustic , provides information about the shape of the caustic and the trajectory of the source through it . from this",
    ", the angle @xmath4 of the trajectory with respect to the caustic can be derived , and also the distance @xmath66 between the caustic crossings in units of @xmath5 .",
    "then , the timescale is given by @xmath67 .",
    "although the above analysis is highly trivialized , it does suggest that the following steps should be taken to ensure an accurate measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "first , it is important to constrain the time of both caustic crossings to reasonable precision .",
    "this means that the survey collaborations should sample on timescales no less than a few days .",
    "second , followup photometry should be initiated relatively soon after the first crossing , to measure the shape of the intra - caustic light curve reasonably well .",
    "this is also necessary in order to predict the second caustic crossing ( jaroszy ' nski & mao 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , the follow - up photometry should continue past the second caustic crossing , to detect cusp - approaches or cusp - crossings ( or the lack thereof ) .    due to the difficulties inherent in fitting binary - lens light curves",
    ", it would be extremely difficult to attempt to predict the expected errors on @xmath3 and @xmath4 for a hypothetical observing scenario .",
    "furthermore , due to the complicated relation between observables and parameters implies that these errors are likely to depend strongly on the geometry of the event and light curve coverage , and therefore such ` predictions ' would not be very useful .",
    "however , we would like to have an order - of - magnitude estimate for the expected errors given reasonable light curve coverage . from determinations of these parameters in published caustic - crossing events",
    ", we can expect fractional accuracies of a few percent , provided that the light curve is well - covered , in the sense outlined above .",
    "however , if the light curve coverage is incomplete , then errors of @xmath68 are expected . see  [ sec : errors ] .",

    "the unlensed source position @xmath88 , which is comprised of the parallax and proper motion of the source in some astrometric frame , can be determined via measurements of the unlensed motion of the source . since the astrometric effects falls off very slowly ( as @xmath89 ) , these must be obtained many @xmath3 after the event is over .",
    "in fact , such measurements are not strictly needed in order to measure @xmath5 ( but may be desirable for other reasons , see  [ sec : dos ] ) .",

    "our simulation consists of the following elements : a galactic model and model of the ensemble of lenses to generate an ensemble of microlensing events , an observational strategy , and a fit of these observations to a set of parameters including @xmath5 .",
    "our ensemble of lenses is identical to that of graff & gould ( 2002 ) .",
    "briefly , we draw sources and lenses from self - lensing isothermal sphere 8 kpc from the observer , and with two - dimensional velocity dispersion of @xmath95 .",
    "both masses in the binary lens are chosen from the remnant mass function of gould ( 2000 ) .",
    "we pick a flat distribution in @xmath96 , the logarithm of the dimensionless binary separation .",
    "the path of the source through the lens geometry is chosen randomly with a uniform distribution of angular impact parameter @xmath97 , and we only consider paths that cross caustics . , but are weighted towards large @xmath5 events by multiplying the mass function by @xmath98 . ]    as discussed in graff & gould ( 2002 ) , in this ensemble of events there are many more events with a short time between caustic crossings , the _ caustic interior time @xmath99 _ , than is observationally detected by the macho and ogle observing groups .",
    "this led these authors to suggest that most events with a short caustic interior time are not detected as caustic crossing binaries , and to define a caustic crossing detection efficiency @xmath100 akin to the standard single lens detection efficiency @xmath101 .",
    "the observational strategy is relatively unimportant , as long as there are astrometric measurement on either side of a caustic .",
    "although it is conceivable that observations might be scheduled at particularly favorable times , such as times of maximum magnification or maximum displacement of the image centroid , it is likely that the telescope measuring the astrometric displacement will be oversubscribed .",
    "a simpler strategy would be to schedule periodic observations in advance .",

    "that is , the first observation comes @xmath102 days after the first caustic crossing .",
    "we assume observations are made for a total of 36 days , which corresponds to approximately @xmath103 for the median event timescale .",
    "practically , observations should continue until after the second caustic crossing , and the total number of observations should be at least as large as the number of parameters to be constrained .    as we discuss in  [ sec : errors ] ( see also table 1 ) , well covered binary lenses can be fit photometrically with small errors on the parameters .",

    "and diameter @xmath111 collects @xmath112 photons per second at @xmath113 .",
    "] we assume that the fractional photometric accuracy is simply @xmath114 , and that the astrometric uncertainty is @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the width of the point spread function , or in the case of an interferometer , the fringe separation . here",
    "we have assumed @xmath117mas .",
    "it is trivial to scale our results to brighter sources or larger telescopes : the fractional uncertainty in @xmath5 is simply proportional to @xmath114 .",
    "we always fit for the four parameters required to establish a local astrometric frame , and @xmath5 and @xmath90 , the size scale and orientation of the microlensing excursion .",
    "we also assumed that the satellite which measures the astrometric motion is 0.2 au from the ( ground based ) photometric measurements which fix the lens parameters .",
    "thus , we can simultaneously fit for @xmath118 , the projected einstein ring radius , in the manner of graff & gould ( 2002 ) .",
    "in addition to this basic fit , we also considered blending from luminous lenses and binary sources , which requires several additional parameters .",

    "1999a ) , a binary - lens event in which the rotation of the binary was detected ( macho 97-blg-41 ; albrow et  al .",
    "2000 ) , and a binary - lens event for which both rotation and parallax effects were detected ( eros blg-2000 - 5 ; an et  al .",

    "thus , although it is difficult to draw any general conclusions from these unique events , it is does seem likely that errors of @xmath131 are achievable for most types of events in which the source is resolved .",
    "also presented in table 1 are the determined values of the @xmath132-magnitude of the source , for all six events . at @xmath133 , the source star for macho 98-smc-1 would be too faint to target with most upcoming interferometers , including sim .",
    "the other events are primarily bulge clump giants ( @xmath134 ) , for which accuracies of @xmath135 should be achievable with a reasonable amount of exposure time with upcoming interferometers , and in particular with @xmath136 minutes of sim time ( see  [ sec : number ] for a estimate of the required exposure times for sim ) . in these cases , the expected error on @xmath1 is typically dominated by @xmath122 , and therefore we can expect @xmath137 .",
    "the source of ogle-1999-bul-23 is g / k subgiant ( @xmath138 ) , and thus dimmer .",
    "the time required to achieve an accuracy of @xmath139 will be larger by a factor of @xmath140 , or @xmath141 for sim .",
    "our goal in  [ sec : method ] was to capture the essence of the method of measuring @xmath1 , and the discussions were therefore somewhat oversimplified , and glossed over several important points . in particular , we concentrated on fold caustic crossing binary - lens events toward the bulge , whereas measurements of @xmath1 should be possible in other , rarer , types of events , such as cusp - crossings and single - lens events , and possibly events toward the magellanic clouds .",
    "we also ignored various higher - order effects which could , in principle , complicate the measurements .",
    "we therefore briefly discuss some of these complications and extensions .",
    "we also discuss the prospects for measuring the spectral type of the source , and also its distance , in order to convert from angular radius @xmath1 to physical radius @xmath36 . finally ,",
    "we present an example observing campaign aimed at measuring angular radii for a significant sample of sources , outlining the resources required , and estimating the number of @xmath1 measurements that might be made per year for such a campaign .",
    "although we have focussed on fold caustic - crossing binary - lens events toward the bulge , it is important to emphasize that @xmath1 can , in principle , be measured for other types of caustic - crossing events such as cusp - crossing events , single - lens events , and all types of caustic - crossing events toward the magellanic clouds . indeed , in ",
    "[ sec : errors ] we discussed examples in the literature of a single - lens and two cusp - crossing events for which a @xmath11 measurement of @xmath1 would have been feasible .    in general , isolated cusp crossings , such as in macho 98-blg-28 , can not be predicted in advance , and thus planning for such events is difficult , if not impossible .",
    "however , one will still have some advance warning of those cusp events which occur just after or in place of second fold caustic crossings . for such events , sufficient photometric coverage of the crossing",
    "should routinely be possible . in all cases ,",
    "it is more difficult to disentangle the information arising from the cusp itself with the information from the global light curve .",
    "this generally implies that the analysis of these light curves will be more complicated , however this does not necessarily preclude an accurate measurement of @xmath1 .",
    "single - lens events are less desirable simply because they require a factor of @xmath9 times more astrometric observing time to achieve the same fractional accuracy in @xmath5 as binary - lens events . since the astrometric observations are likely to be the most limited resource , this makes single lens events considerably less attractive .",
    "if it were possible to measure angular radii of stars in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) , this would be quite interesting , due to the metal - poor nature of the stars .",
    "unfortunately , there are several major hindrances to measuring @xmath1 for a substantial number of stars in the mcs .",
    "first , the event rates toward both the mcs are small , and a large number of stars must be monitored just to detect a few events per year . therefore , the number of caustic - crossing events is quite low . to date",
    ", there have been only two caustic crossing events toward the mcs : macho 98-smc-1 , which we discussed in  [ sec : errors ] , and macho lmc-9 .",
    "these events have source magnitudes of @xmath142 ( afonso et  al .",
    "2000 ) and @xmath143 ( alcock et al .",
    "2000a ) , respectively , which brings up a second difficulty : sim can not follow source stars fainter than @xmath144 , so these two events could not have been used to measure the angular radii of their source stars . in fact , even if the entire lmc were monitored for microlensing , only @xmath65 event per year would have @xmath145 , and this event would be from an evolved star . the probability of a caustic - crossing event ( either binary or single lens ) is smaller by at least an order of magnitude .",
    "the paucity of events and faintness of the source stars might be circumvented if sufficiently rapid target of opportunity times are available . in this case",
    ", it might be possible to use intrinsically fainter source stars , for which caustic - crossing event will be more common , and measure the astrometric displacement during the brief period of time when the source is highly magnified as it crosses the caustic .",
    "the maximum magnification of a source of dimensionless size @xmath146 crossing a fold caustic is @xmath147 . for main - sequence sources , @xmath148 , or more than three magnitudes , and thus sources with @xmath149",
    "can briefly be brightened to sim detectability .",
    "for example , the source star of macho 98-smc-1 was brighter than @xmath150 for about 7 hours during the second caustic crossing .",
    "finally , even if the source does attain a sufficient brightness to be measurable by sim , it remains to be seen whether the centroid varies sufficiently during this time to provide an accurate measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "this is especially difficult in light of the fact that typical value of @xmath5 for self - lensing events toward the mcs are only an order of magnitude larger than sim s accuracy ( paczy ' nski 1998 , gould & salim 1999 ) . in summary",
    ", it appears that it will be quite difficult to measure angular radii of stars in the mcs using this method , especially if the majority of the events seen toward these targets are due to self - lensing ( sahu 1994 ) .",
    "the method we have presented here is only interesting if it can feasibly be used to make precise @xmath1 measurements for a large number of sources with reasonable expenditure of resources .",
    "since the requisite astrometric instruments are likely to be the most limited resource , it is crucial that accurate and unambiguous determinations of @xmath5 be generically possible using a few astrometric measurements , when combined with the photometric light curve solution .",
    "we have explained how a complete photometric solution _ generally _ leads to a prediction for the astrometric centroid shift up to an unknown scale @xmath5 and orientation @xmath90 on the sky .",
    "however , this is true only under a number of simplifying assumptions , including uniform motion of the observer , source , and lens , dark lenses , isolated sources , and unique global solutions .",
    "if one or more of these assumptions are violated , then the prediction for shape of the astrometric curve may not be unique , and thus the measurement of @xmath5 may be compromised .",
    "we therefore discuss each of these complications and under what conditions they may be important .",
    "binary lenses are characterized by two quantities : @xmath81 , the mass ratio , and @xmath42 , the instantaneous projected separation in units of @xmath5 .",
    "it has been demonstrated both theoretically ( dominik 1999a ) and observationally ( afonso et  al .",
    "2000 , albrow et  al .",
    "2002 ) that certain limiting cases of binary lenses can exhibit extremely similar observable properties .",
    "in particular , dominik ( 1999 ) showed that the binary - lens equation can be approximated by an single lens with external shear , or chang - refsdal ( cr ) lens",
    "( chang & refsdal 1979,1984 ) , near the individual masses for widely - separated binaries ( @xmath151 ) , and near the secondary ( least massive ) lens when @xmath152 .",
    "furthermore , near the center - of - mass of a close binary , the lens equation is well - approximated by a quadrupole lens , and both the quadrupole lens and cr - lens can exhibit extremely similar magnifications when the quadrupole moment is equated to the shear ( albrow et  al .",
    "2002 ) . thus there can exist multiple degenerate solutions to an observed photometric light curve , even with extremely accurate photometry .",
    "however the astrometric behavior of these degenerate solutions is very similar both in the shape and overall scale of the astrometric curves , at least for the close / wide degeneracy ( gould & han 2000 ) .",
    "therefore this degeneracy should not affect the determination of @xmath5 using the prediction from the light curve .",
    "it is likely that the other intrinsic denegeracies will also not affect the determination of @xmath5 , since the degeneracy arises from the lens equation itself , and thus affects both the photometric and astrometric curve in the same manner .",
    "note that it is important that the normalization of @xmath5 be consistent for the two degenerate solutions .",
    "for example , consider the case of the close / wide degeneracy in macho 98-smc-1 ( afonso et  al 2000 , gould & han 2000 ) .",
    "if one normalizes to the total mass of the binary , the close solution implies a value of @xmath153 , whereas the wide solution has @xmath154 . since the astrometric curves are essentially identical ( both in shape and scale ) , one might therefore suspect the inversion of this process would yield two equally likely values of @xmath1 that differed by a factor of @xmath155",
    "of course , this ` ambiguity ' is wholly artificial , and arises because the value of @xmath156 for the wide binary is normalized to the entire mass of the binary , whereas the lensing effects are basically caused by the least massive lens , since @xmath157 .",
    "normalizing to the mass of the single lens , @xmath158 , where here @xmath159 , and thus @xmath160 , essentially identical to the close - binary solution .",
    "note that as @xmath42 approaches unity , the identification of the ` proper ' @xmath5 normalization becomes more nebulous , since the lenses can no longer be considered independent .",
    "however , the degeneracies also become less severe as @xmath161 .",
    "dominik ( 1999b ) has also shown that poorly - sampled binary lens light curve can also yield distinct degenerate solutions .",
    "note that these solutions are ` accidental ' in the sense that they do not arise from degeneracies in the lens equation itself .",
    "thus han et al . ( 1999 ) found that such degenerate photometric light curves yield astrometric curves which are widely different .",
    "such degeneracies would prohibit the measurement of @xmath5 using a few astrometric measurements .",
    "therefore well - sampled photometric light curves are essential for reliable measurements of @xmath1 .",
    "if the two observers are displaced by a significant fraction of @xmath162 , the angular einstein ring radius projected onto the observer plane , then the source position @xmath88 as seen by the two observers will be significantly different . since sim will be in an earth - trailing orbit , it will drift away from the earth at a rate of @xmath163 .",
    "thus after 2.5 years ( half way through the sim mission ) , it will be displaced from the earth by @xmath164 , which corresponds to a displacement in the einstein ring of , @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the angle between the the line of sight and the earth - sim vector . for typical bulge parameters , @xmath167 and therefore @xmath168 .",
    "this implies that both the magnification @xmath82 and the centroid shift @xmath169 will be significantly different ( at a given time ) as seen from the earth and sim .",
    "since the value of @xmath170 is not known _ a priori _ , @xmath171 can not be predicted from the ground - based photometry alone , and must be estimated from the astrometric data itself .",
    "fortunately , sim will likely have excellent photometric capabilities ( see gould & salim 1999 ) , and thus the relative magnifications between the light curves from the ground and sim will provide additional constraints . indeed , in our monte carlo simulations , we assumed that the astrometric observer was displaced by @xmath172 from the earth , and simultaneously fit for both @xmath5 and @xmath170 ( among other parameters ) , and found that @xmath5 could still be constrained quite accurately .",
    "this is because the information about @xmath170 comes primarily from the photometry , while the information about @xmath5 comes primarily from the astrometry .",
    "therefore , the two parameters are not degenerate .",
    "note that a ` byproduct ' of these measurements is a determination of the total mass of the binary lens ( gould & salim 1999 ; han & kim 2000 ; graff & gould 2002 )    there are two additional parallax effects .",
    "one is due to the motion of the earth ( or sim ) around the sun , and will become significant on timescales that are a substantial fraction of a year , which corresponds to many @xmath3 for typical bulge events .",
    "there is also a second order effect that arises from the difference in projected velocities between the earth and sim .",
    "this effect is @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the transverse velocity of the lens projected on the observer plane , and is @xmath175 for typical bulge self - lensing events .",
    "since the velocities and positions of the earth and sim will be known , both of these effects can easily be included in the fit for the microlensing parallax , and so do not present any additional difficulties .      with its planned 10 meter baseline , sim will have a resolution of @xmath176 , sufficient to resolve the majority of unassociated nearby stars that are blended with the source in ground - based photometry ( han & kim 1999 ) .",
    "since the photometric blending is well - constrained in binary - lens events , unambiguous prediction of the unblended astrometric behavior of the source is possible .",
    "thus , blending will typically not affect the measurement of @xmath5 .",
    "however , luminous lenses and companions to the source star with separations @xmath177 will not be automatically resolved by sim ( jeong , han & park 1999 ) .",
    "dalal & griest ( 2001 ) have shown that , using two pointings , this limit may be lowered to @xmath178 , however it is essentially impossible to resolve multiple sources with separations below this limit ( e.g.  binary source companions ) . in these cases , all that will be measured is the total centroid of all the sources in the resolution element .",
    "the centroid in the presence of luminous lenses , @xmath179 , is related to the centroid in the absence of blending , @xmath85 , by @xmath180 \\left(1 + \\frac{f_t}{a}\\right)^{-1 } , \\label{eqn : dbpclt}\\ ] ] where @xmath181 is the sum of the flux of all unlensed sources ( blends ) relative to @xmath182 , the baseline flux of the lensed source , @xmath82 is the magnification of the source , and @xmath183 is the centroid of the blends relative to the origin of the lens . from , it is clear blending is more complicated in astrometric microlensing than in photometric microlensing : whereas photometric blending can be described by one parameter , the blend fraction @xmath184 , astrometric blending requires two additional parameters , the centroid of light of the blend @xmath183 .",
    "a special case of astrometric blending is bright lens blending . in the single lens case , this eliminates the blend location parameters , the location of the centroid of light is the moving lens ( i.e.  @xmath185 ) . in bright binary lens blending , only one parameter is eliminated , the centroid of light is somewhere on the lens axis between the two stars in the lens .",
    "however , it will generally not be known _ a priori _ which case one is dealing with , and therefore @xmath183 must be included as a parameter in the astrometric fit .",
    "blending is problematic because it effectively ` dilutes ' the astrometric shift between two points in the lightcurve , which is qualitatively similar to the effect of changing @xmath5 .",
    "if the event is not well covered , these two effects can be quite degenerate . in order to determine how degenerate blending is with the @xmath5",
    ", we have included in our monte carlo simulations a fixed amount of blended light of @xmath186 , and @xmath187 .",
    "we assume that @xmath184 is known ( i.e.  from photometry ) , but @xmath183 is not .",
    "the results are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we find that , if the blending fraction is close to 1 , then the two effects are nearly degenerate , and our fractional uncertainty in @xmath5 increases by two orders of magnitude to of order unity .",
    "however , for @xmath188 , the median error increases by less than a factor of two . in most cases ,",
    "the blending will be known to be small from the photometric data . in these cases , the fractional uncertainty in @xmath5",
    "will not be seriously degraded .",
    "the few events with known large blending can be easily jettisoned from the sample .",
    "the photometric effects of lens rotation in binary microlensing events has been explored theoretically by dominik ( 1998 ) and has been detected in event macho 1997-bul-41 ( albrow et  al .",
    "the astrometric effects of rotating binary - lenses have not been explored , and it is therefore difficult to draw any general conclusions as to the importance of this effect .",
    "however , to the extent that it is detectable in the photometric light curve , lens rotation poses no difficulties , as its astrometric effect should be predictable from the global solution .",
    "effects that are photometrically undetectable but astrometrically significant are potentially problematic .    the amount that a binary - lens rotates during @xmath3 is given by , @xmath189 where @xmath190 , and assuming circular , face - on orbits . because the caustic cross - section is maximized for binaries with separations of order @xmath5 , the majority of detected caustic - crossings will have @xmath191 ( baltz & gondolo 2001 ) . therefore , for typical events , the effects of binary rotation should be small if astrometric observations are closely spaced with respect to the event timescale @xmath3 .",
    "this is generally also advantageous for the accurate recovery of @xmath5 ( see  [ sec : thetae ] ) .      in this paper , we have emphasized the measurement of the angular radius @xmath1 , rather than the physical radius , @xmath36 . however , it may also be interesting to measure @xmath36 for some events . in order to do this",
    ", the distance to the source star must be measured independently .",
    "fortunately , the astrometric accuracy needed to measure @xmath1 is generally sufficient to measure the parallax @xmath192 of the source stars , @xmath193 in order to measure @xmath36 to a similar accuracy as @xmath1 ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath192 must be measured to somewhat better accuracy , which implies an astrometric error of @xmath194 . for sim and an @xmath113 source ,",
    "this is achievable with @xmath195 hours of integration , which is considerably more time than is needed for the @xmath1 measurement alone .",
    "however , it is important to note that these measurements can be made after the microlensing event is over .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to employ ground - based interferometers for the measurement of @xmath192 , rather than spend precious sim resources , at least for brighter sources .",
    "a measurement of @xmath1 is essentially useless if the spectral type and luminosity class of the source is not known .",
    "the source stars of microlensing events can be typed in two ways .",
    "the first is to simply measure the color and apparent magnitude of the source .",
    "this information is generally acquired automatically from the fit to the photometric data of the microlensing event . by positioning the source star on a color - magnitude diagram of other stars in the field",
    ", one can generally type the source to reasonable accuracy .",
    "the primary pitfalls of this method are differential reddening and projection effects ( i.e.  the source may in the foreground or background of the bulk of the stars in the field ) .    a more robust way of typing the source star is to acquire spectra .",
    "this is best done when the source is highly magnified as it crosses a caustic , as this minimizes the effects of blended light and increases the signal - to - noise .",
    "thus such measurements require target - of - opportunity observations . for highly - magnified events , spectra with @xmath196 per resolution element",
    "can be achieved with exposure times of tens of minutes for low - resolution spectra ( lennon et  al .",
    "1996 ) , or a couple of hours for high - resolution spectra ( minniti et  al .",
    "1998 ) , using 8 m or 10m - class telescopes .",
    "although low - resolution spectra are sufficient for accurate      + spectral typing , high resolution spectra are desirable for a number of other applications , including resolution of the atmosphere of the source star ( gaudi & gould 1999 , castro et  al .",
    "2001 , albrow et  al .",
    "2001b ) , detailed abundance analysis ( minniti et  al .  1998 ) , and detection of a luminous lens ( mao , reetz , & lennon 1998 ) .",
    "note also that as a byproduct , true space velocities of a sample of stars in the bulge will be obtained by combining the proper motions and parallaxes of the sources acquired from astrometric measurements with radial velocities determined from the spectra .      in this section ,",
    "we review the requirements for measuring @xmath1 for the source stars of galactic bulge microlensing events , and outline the resources needed for a campaign aimed at measuring @xmath1 for a significant number of sources .",
    "the first requirement is a large sample of caustic - crossing binary - lens events from which to choose targets , which in turn requires an even larger sample of microlensing events .",
    "a large sample is important in that it ensures that only interesting and promising sources and events are followed .",
    "currently , both the ogle and moa collaborations monitor many millions of stars in the galactic bulge . both reduce their data real - time , enabling them to issue ` alerts , ' notification of ongoing microlensing events ( udalski et  al .",
    "1994 , bond et  al .",

    "combined , these two collaborations should alert about @xmath197 events per year ( with the majority of alerts from ogle ) . extrapolating from previous results ( alcock et al .  2000a , udalski et al .",
    "2000 ) , approximately @xmath14 of these will be caustic - crossing binaries , or 25 events per year .",
    "figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution of apparent ( i.e.uncorrected for redenning ) @xmath132 magnitudes of the 438 independent bulge microlensing alerts in 2002 for which baseline magnitudes were available .",
    "of these events , 382 ( @xmath198 ) were alerted by ogle , 61 ( @xmath199 ) were alerted by moa , and 5 were alerted by both collaborations . for the typical colors of sources in the bulge ( @xmath200 ) , only about @xmath201 of the alerts have @xmath202 , and thus would have been accessible to sim .",
    "the boundary between dwarfs and giants will occur at an apparent magnitude that depends on the color of the source , the distance to the source , and the reddening .",
    "however , for definiteness we will simply assume that the boundary between giants and main sequence stars occurs at roughly @xmath203 . with this assumption",
    ", we can therefore expect that approximately @xmath204 of all alerted events will be due to giant stars .",
    "therefore , we can expect approximately @xmath205 of all alerts , or @xmath206 events ( assuming 500 alerts ) , to be caustic crossing events with giant sources , and @xmath207 , or @xmath208 events , to be caustic crossing events with main sequence sources , @xmath209 of which will be bright enough to monitor with sim .- magnitude of the source .",
    "in fact , deviations from the single - lens form will generally be easier to detect in brighter sources , however this bias is likely to be relatively small for caustic - crossing events , which generally exhibit dramatic and easily - detectable deviations from the point lens form .",
    "this may seem in contradiction with the fact that none of the five events toward the bulge presented in table 1 are main sequence sources .",
    "however , this almost certainly a selection effect : bright binary - lens events are currently preferentially monitored by the follow - up collaborations , in order to achieve higher signal - to - noise during the second caustic crossing . ] these numbers are likely to remain valid at least for the next several years .",
    "however , in the more distant future , and in particular by the time sim is launched , it is likely that the next generation of microlensing survey collaborations will have come online .",
    "thus we can expect that , when sim time is operational , a considerably larger sample of caustic - crossing events will be available .",
    "survey - type experiments are needed to discover microlensing events toward the bulge , and survey - quality data is generally sufficient to uncover the caustic - crossing nature of the target events . however , as we discussed in  [ sec : dt ] , more accurate and densely - sampled photometry is generally needed during the caustic crossing in order to measure @xmath2 .",
    "currently , there are several collaborations with dedicated ( or substantial ) access to 1 - 2 m class telescopes distributed throughout the southern hemisphere that closely monitor alerted microlensing events with the goal of discovering deviations from the single - lens form , with emphasis on search for extrasolar planets ( albrow et  al .",

    "it seems likely that these collaborations , or similar ones , will still be in place when the next generation of interferometers , or even sim , come online .    in our monte carlo simulations we derived the expected precisions @xmath210 assuming that the photometric errors were dominated by photon statistics , and that a total of @xmath110 photons where collected over the entire exposure time for each event",
    "this corresponds to total exposure time of @xmath211 for sim on an @xmath113 source .",
    "we assume the fractional photometric uncertainty is @xmath114 , and that the astrometric uncertainty was related to the photometric uncertainty via the expression , @xmath212 , with @xmath213mas , as appropriate for sim .",
    "since we assumed that the photometric and astrometric errors are given simply by photon statistics , it is trivial to scale our results for other total exposure times @xmath214 and source brightnesses assuming the characteristics of sim : @xmath215 , and @xmath216 . for the purposes of planning observations , and providing an order - of - magnitude estimate for the number of angular radii that can be measured for a given amount of sim time , it is useful to derive an expression for the exposure time required to achieve a given median photometric precision . to be conservative ,",
    "we assume that the blending is small , but non - negligible .",
    "specifically , we adopt the median error found for the monte carlo simulations assuming a blend fraction of @xmath217 , which is @xmath218 .",
    "then , @xmath219 thus , for giant sources ( @xmath220 ) , @xmath221 minutes are required to achieve @xmath14 precision , whereas for main - sequence sources ( @xmath222 ) , @xmath223 hours are required for @xmath14 precision , or @xmath224 hours for @xmath16 precision .",
    "we have focussed here primarily on astrometric observations with sim because its capabilities are well - suited to this application .",
    "the basic requirements to be able to measure @xmath5 accurately for the events we have discussed are relatively high astrometric precisions , @xmath225 , and high sensitivity ( via , i.e.  large apertures ) , as the sources we are considering are faint , @xmath226 .",
    "these faint sources are inaccessible to current ground - based interferometers .",
    "upcoming large - aperture , ground - based interferometers , such as the very large telescope interferometer or the keck interferometer , should be able to achieve the requisite astrometric precisions on all of the bright ( @xmath227 ) giant events .",
    "if the target microlensing source happens to have a bright star within the isoplanatic angle , it may be possible to employ phase referencing to extend sensitivity to very faint @xmath228 sources .",
    "this would allow one to measure @xmath5 for main - sequences sources from the ground as well .",
    "finally , it may be possible to determine @xmath5 from single - epoch measurements of the visibility and/or closure phase ( delplancke , g ' orski , & richichi 2001 , dalal & lane 2003 ) . in this way ,",
    "sensitivity could plausibly be extended to main - sequences sources by making carefully - timed interferometric measurements of the source when it is highly - magnified during a caustic crossing .",
    "however , it is not clear if there exists enough structure in the image positions during this time to extract @xmath5 .",
    "this remains an interesting topic for future study .",
    "non - targeted space - based astrometric surveys , such as the global astrometric interferometer for astrophysics , are generally not well - suited to this application , due to the relatively sparse sampling of the source stars .    finally , access to target - of - opportunity time on 8 - 10 m class telescopes would allow for accurate spectral typing of the source stars .",
    "several nights per bulge season would likely be adequate to type the @xmath229 caustic - crossing events per year .",
    "however , more time would be required to perform some of the auxiliary science discussed in  [ sec : dos ] , such as resolution of the source - star atmospheres .",
    "thus , by combining alerts from survey collaborations , with comprehensive ground - based photometry from follow - up collaborations with access to dedicated ( or semi - dedicated ) 1m - class telescopes , and a modest allocation of a total 10 hours of sim time , it should be possible to measure the angular radii of @xmath29 giant stars in the bulge to @xmath14 , or @xmath10 main sequence stars to @xmath16 .",
    "several nights of target - of - opportunity time on @xmath230 m telescopes should allow for accurate spectral typing of the sources via high or low - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we have outlined a method to measure the angular radii @xmath1 of giant and main sequence source stars of fold caustic - crossing binary microlensing events toward the galactic bulge . our method to measure @xmath1 consists of four steps .",
    "first , survey - quality data can be used to discover and alert caustic - crossing binary - lensing events .",
    "such data is sufficient to characterize the event timescale @xmath3 and the angle @xmath4 of source trajectory with respect to the caustic .",
    "dense sampling of one of the caustic crossings yields the caustic - crossing timescale @xmath231 .",
    "the global solution to the binary - lens light curve yields a prediction for the trajectory of the centroid of the source up to an unknown angle @xmath90 , and the scale , @xmath5 .",
    "thus a few , precise astrometric measurements during the course of the event yield @xmath5 . the angular source radius is then simply given by @xmath6 .",
    "we argued , based on past experience with modeling binary - lens events , that the parameters @xmath231 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 should be measurable to a few percent accuracy , provided one caustic - crossing is densely and accurately sampled , and the entire event is reasonably well - covered .",
    "we then performed a series of monte carlo experiments that demonstrated that astrometric measurements during the course of the binary - lens event should allow for the determination of @xmath5 to @xmath232 accuracy , assuming photon - limited statistics and a total of 60,000 photons per event .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath9 fewer photons than are required to measure @xmath5 to the same precision in single - lens events and corresponds to an exposure time of @xmath233  hour with sim on an @xmath113 source .",
    "therefore , it should be possible to measure @xmath1 for a significant sample of giant and main - sequence stars in the bulge with reasonable expenditure of resources",
