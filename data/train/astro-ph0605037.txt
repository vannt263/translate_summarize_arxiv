    "for many decades , color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) have provided fundamental insights into the physics of stellar evolution and stellar atmospheres . in an analogous fashion",
    ", the cmds of brown dwarfs are beginning to shed light on the physical properties of these low mass objects , as an increasing number of distances have been determined from trigonometric parallaxes for field brown dwarfs @xcite and from brown dwarf companions around stars with known distances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , interpretation of brown dwarf cmds is considerably less developed than for the case of stellar cmds .",
    "brown dwarfs continually cool as they age , unlike stars which occupy a fixed position on the cmd during the main - sequence phase . therefore , there are degeneracies in determining the masses and ages of brown dwarfs from the cmd .",
    "substellar photospheres have a rich appearance due to the presence of dust and molecules ( e.g. , metal hydrides , water vapor , and methane ) , and spectroscopic methods to determine the associated physical properties , such as effective temperature and surface gravity , are still under development ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the optical and infrared cmds of brown dwarfs show considerable scatter which could be due to differences in metallicity , surface gravity ( i.e. , mass ) , rotation , dust properties , and/or unrecognized binarity among the observational ensemble ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "study of ultracool binary systems is a promising means to address these issues , since binaries provide systems with common ages and metallicities .",
    "about two dozen l  dwarf binaries are now known from high resolution imaging of over a hundred l  dwarfs , mostly by _ hst_@xcite .",
    "in contrast , only five ultracool binaries that include at least one t  dwarf have been identified : 2mass  j1225@xmath42739ab ( t6+t8 ; @xcite ) , 2mass  j1534@xmath42952ab ( t5.5+t5.5 ; @xcite ) , @xmath5  ind  bab ( t1+t6 ; ) , sdss  j0423@xmath40414ab ( l6+t2 ; @xcite ) , and 2mass  j2252@xmath41730ab ( l6+t2 ; @xcite ) . and 2mass  j1728 + 3948 [ @xcite ] ) , near - ir flux ratios ( gl  337cd ; @xcite ) , or integrated - light spectra ( 2mass  j0518@xmath42828 [ @xcite ] and 2mass  j0920 + 3517 [ @xcite ] ) . ]",
    "understanding the transition between objects of spectral type  l , marked by very red ir colors and metal hydride absorption , and those of spectral type  t , marked by blue ir colors and methane absorption , has been an active area of inquiry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we are conducting an imaging survey of nearby brown dwarfs using the new keck laser guide star adaptive optics system ( lgs ao ) .",
    "lgs ao enables near diffraction - limited imaging over most of the sky with a 10-meter telescope .",
    "thus , lgs ao is a powerful new capability for finding and characterizing substellar binaries .",
    "we have previously used keck lgs ao to discover that the nearby l  dwarf kelu-1 is a binary system @xcite , thereby explaining the unusual properties of kelu-1 ( high luminosity , very red color , high inferred effective temperature , and low lithium absorption line strength ) compared to other early l  dwarfs . in this paper , we present the discovery of the binarity of sdss  j153417.05 + 161546.1 ( hereinafter ) , a recently discovered t  dwarf with an integrated - light near - ir spectral type of t3.5@xmath00.5 @xcite , and consider the implications for understanding the l / t transition .",
    "we observed  on 2005  may  1  ut using the sodium lgs ao system @xcite of the 10-meter keck ii telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "we used the facility ir camera nirc2 and the @xmath1 ( 1.25  ) , @xmath2 ( 1.64  ) , and  ( 2.12  ) filters from the mauna kea observatories ( mko ) filter consortium @xcite .",
    "we used nirc2 s narrow camera , which produces a 0.00994  pixel  scale and a 10.2  field of view .",
    "conditions were photometric with excellent seeing conditions during the night , better than 0.6  in the optical as reported by the neighboring keck  i telescope .",
    "the total setup time for the telescope to slew to  and for the lgs ao system to be fully operational was 18  minutes .",
    "was observed over an airmass range of 1.141.24 .",
    "the lgs brightness , as measured by the flux incident on the ao wavefront sensor , was equivalent to a @xmath6  mag star .",
    "the lgs provided the wavefront reference source for ao correction , with the exception of tip - tilt motion .",
    "tip - tilt aberrations and quasi - static changes in the image of the lgs as seen by the wavefront sensor were sensed using the @xmath7  mag star 1062 - 0236346 from the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite , located 14  away from .",
    "the overall image quality was somewhat worse compared to other data obtained on the same night @xcite due to higher winds during the  observations .",
    "the lgs ao - corrected images have full widths at half maxima ( fwhm ) of 0.08 , 0.06 , and 0.07  at @xmath8 , respectively , with rms variations of about 510% .",
    "the corresponding strehl ratios were 0.02 , 0.06 , and 0.20 with rms variations of about 520% .",
    "the fwhm and strehl measurements were derived from the result of the binary fitting process described below .",
    "we obtained a series of five images in each filter , dithering the telescope by a few arcseconds between each image .",
    "the total on - source integration time per filter was 7.5  minutes .",
    "the sodium laser beam was steered with each dither such that the lgs remained on  for all exposures .",
    "this object was easily resolved into a binary system in all our data .",
    "the images were reduced in a standard fashion .",
    "we constructed flat fields from the differences of images of the telescope dome interior with and without lamp illumination .",
    "then we created a master sky frame from the median average of the bias - subtracted , flat - fielded images and subtracted it from the individual images .",
    "images were registered and stacked to form a final mosaic ( figure  1 ) . the known small geometric distortions in nirc2 have a negligible effect on our analysis .    to measure the flux ratios and relative positions of the two components",
    ", we adopted two methods .",
    "( 1 ) the first method used an analytic model of the point spread function ( psf ) as the sum of two elliptical gaussian components , a narrow component for the psf core and a broad component for the psf halo .",
    "( 2 ) the second method empirically determined the psf using the starfinder software package , which was designed for analysis of blended ao images . for the individual images obtained with each filter , we fitted for the flux ratio , separation , and position angle of the binary .",
    "the averages of the results were adopted as the final measurements and the standard deviations as the errors .",
    "the results from the two different methods were generally consistent .    in order to gauge the accuracy of these two measurement methods",
    ", we created artificial binary stars from data of single stars that had comparable image quality ( similar tiptilt star properties , strehl ratios , and fwhm ) to the  data .",
    "our two methods were applied to the artificial binaries to assess the fitting results and derived errors . based on this analysis",
    ", we adopted the starfinder measurements for the @xmath2-band and -band data , and the gaussian fitting results for the @xmath1-band data .",
    "these choices were not unexpected : the higher strehl , long wavelength data had a more structured psf which was better treated by starfinder , while the much smoother , low strehl @xmath1-band images were modeled better by the two - gaussian psf .",
    "table  1 presents the resulting flux ratios and astrometry results .",
    "table  2 reports the ir apparent magnitudes and colors of the individual components , as derived from our flux ratio measurements and the integrated ir magnitudes reported by @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitudes for  are unknown , as a trigonometric parallax is not available for this system .",
    "also , in principle variability could impact the photometry determined for the individual components , since the integrated - light photometry was obtained at a different epoch than the keck lgs ao measurements of the flux ratios .",
    "ir monitoring of a limited number of t  dwarfs does find low - level variability in some objects , though the timescales and persistence are not well - constrained @xcite .",
    "has been observed at 4  epochs by the sdss survey over a span of 11  months and shows no @xmath9-band ( 0.9  ) variability at the @xmath100.1  mag level .",
    "our nirc2 @xmath1 and @xmath2-band imaging used the same mko filters as @xcite and hence computing magnitudes for the individual components from our measured flux ratios is straight - forward .",
    "however , our nirc2 data were obtained with the mko -band ( 2.12  ) filter in order to minimize the thermal background from the sky + ao system , whereas the chiu et al .",
    "photometry used the mko @xmath11-band ( 2.20  ) filter .",
    "@xcite reported a polynomial fit for the @xmath12 color term as a function of spectral type for l  and t  dwarfs using synthetic photometry based on the data from @xcite .",
    "however , for the range of spectral types relevant to  ( see   3 ) , the color term depends strongly on the spectral type inferred from the @xmath13 color .",
    "instead , we use the synthetic photometry to find a direct relation for the color term as a function of the @xmath13 color : @xmath14 valid for l  and t  dwarfs with @xmath15 . the resulting @xmath16 terms are 0.02 and @xmath40.13  mags for components a and b , respectively .",
    "the rms scatter about the fit is 0.03  mags , which we add in quadrature when determining the @xmath11-band photometry errors of the individual components .",
    "figure  1 shows the unique behavior of the near - ir flux ratios for ab compared to all other known substellar binaries : namely , the identification of the brighter component depends on the observing wavelength .",
    "we designate the eastern object as the `` a '' component , based on the fact that its inferred spectral type is earlier than the western component , as discussed in   3 . the eastern object is brighter in @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands , and we would also expect it to be the brighter component at optical wavelengths , based on the t  dwarfs with known distances @xcite .",
    "the western , later - type object is brighter only in the @xmath1-band images .",
    "this can be understood as a manifestation of the @xmath1-band brightening seen in the absolute magnitudes of t  dwarfs , wherein objects of spectral types from about t2 to t5 are notably brighter at @xmath1-band compared to earlier type objects @xcite .",
    "we discuss this further in   4 .",
    "no other sources are detected in our images . for objects at @xmath170.3  from ,",
    "the final mosaics reached point source detection limits of 21.0 , 21.0 , and 20.7  mags at @xmath8 , respectively , out to a separation of 3 . for an age range of 0.55  gyr and a estimated distance of 36  pc ( see   3 ) , these detection limits correspond to about 1030  companions around  based on the models of .",
    "with only one epoch of imaging , we can not ascertain whether the two objects in our keck images are physically associated based solely on common proper motion .",
    "however , the combination of the small proper motion and the distinctive optical / ir colors can only be explained if the system is a binary t  dwarf .",
    "no relative motion was detected between the two components during the 30  minutes elapsed time for the keck lgs ao imaging , so component  b can not be a solar system body ( which would be expected to show a relative motion of @xmath170.5 ) .  was detected at @xmath1 and @xmath2-bands by 2mass in 1999 and by sdss in both 2004 and 2005 , giving a proper motion of 0.15/yr at position angle 248  east of north .",
    "the small proper motion indicates that the optical and ir photometry in @xcite represents the combined light of both objects , and thus our keck ir flux ratio measurements can be used to derive the resolved photometry of the individual components .",
    "the resulting ir colors for the two components are entirely consistent with those of t  dwarfs .",
    "component b does have neutral @xmath18 colors similar to hot o stars and white dwarfs , but if it were either of these objects , the integrated optical light of the system would be predominantly blue rather than very red as observed ( @xmath19  mags ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we conclude that the two objects constitute a binary t  dwarf .    to infer spectral types , we compare the resolved @xmath18 colors of ab to those of ultracool dwarfs from @xcite and @xcite , excluding any known binaries . our measurements and the published photometry were both obtained with the mko filter system . for the l  dwarfs ,",
    "we use the published spectral types , which are based on the @xcite near - ir classification scheme . for the t  dwarfs",
    ", we use near - ir classfications from the @xcite scheme .",
    "( we adopt these two classification schemes throughout this paper , which includes updating older published t dwarf types to the new burgasser et al .  scheme . )",
    "we assume that the components of  are themselves single , not unresolved binaries .",
    "figure 2 shows that component  a has ir colors most typical of the known t1 dwarfs , with t2 also being possible .",
    "( the colors of component  a are also similar to the few late - l dwarfs with unusually blue near - ir colors in figure  2 . however",
    ", as discussed below , modeling of the integrated - light spectrum indicates that this is unlikely . )",
    "component  b has ir colors most similar to the t5 dwarfs and some of the t6  dwarfs .",
    "we estimate spectral type estimates of t1.5@xmath00.5 and t5.5@xmath00.5 for the two components .",
    "color , whereas the colors of  are consistent with other t  dwarfs .",
    "] we modeled the integrated - light spectrum of  as the blend of two template t  dwarfs , in order to check the consistency with the flux ratios and spectral types inferred from our keck lgs imaging . for templates , we chose t  dwarfs from figure  2 with complete @xmath18 spectra and having similar near - ir colors to the two components of  ( color differences of @xmath200.1  mags ) .",
    "then we scaled the template spectra to match the observed @xmath1-band flux ratio , summed the templates to form a composite spectrum , and scaled the resulting composite to the observed integrated - light spectrum .",
    "( note that this approach has only one free parameter in the modeling , namely the distance to the binary . )",
    "the comparisons between the model composite spectra and the observed spectrum show good agreement ( figure  3).-band flux ratio .",
    "the resulting set of blended spectra could not simultaneously match the  integrated - light spectrum and the observed @xmath18 flux ratios .",
    "the mismatch is not surprising given that most of the t  dwarfs with measured distances do not have the same near - ir colors as a  and  b. as figure  2 shows , there is significant color scatter within a given t  subclass . ] likewise , although a has near - ir colors similar to some of the bluest late - l dwarfs , it was not possible to create a well - matched composite spectrum with a blue late - l dwarf as a template , and thus we discount this possibility .",
    "overall , the spectral types estimated from modeling the integrated - light spectrum agree well with those from the resolved keck near - ir colors .    in the absence of a trigonometric parallax",
    ", the model composite spectra can provide a rough distance estimate for ab .",
    "the spectra were created using 2mass  j2356@xmath41553 ( t5.5 ; @xcite ) and sdss  j2124 + 0100 ( t5 ; @xcite ) to represent component  b. @xcite have measured a trigonometric parallax for 2mass  j2356@xmath41553 .",
    "for sdss  j2124 + 0100 , we assumed an absolute @xmath1-band magnitude of 14.37  mags , based on the polynomial fit for the absolute @xmath1-band magnitude as a function of spectral type from @xcite . assuming these two mid - t templates are single objects , the inferred distance modulus for ab is 2.72.9  mags ( @xmath2136  pc ) . to check on the distance estimated from our spectral modeling",
    ", we applied the same procedure to the integrated - light spectrum of the binary t  dwarf  bab and derived a distance estimate of 3.3  pc , in good agreement with the measured distance of 3.626@xmath00.009  pc .",
    "we can estimate the mass ratio ab , independent of its distance .",
    "for the assumed spectral types of t1.5@xmath00.5 and t5.5@xmath00.5 , the difference in bolometric corrections for the two components is 0.55@xmath00.15  mags , with @xmath22 being larger for the t1.5@xmath00.5 component @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11-band flux ratio for the system is 1.21@xmath00.05  mags , based on our keck lgs images and the ( @xmath23 ) color term calculated in   2 .",
    "hence , the difference in bolometric luminosities is 0.7@xmath00.2  mags , with component  a having the higher luminosity . @xcite",

    "this implies a mass rataio of about 0.80@xmath00.05 for the two components of , which is similar to the nearly equal mass ratios found for other binary brown dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "likewise , we can estimate the surface gravity difference for the two components , independent of the distance .",
    "since the radii of brown dwarfs older than @xmath17300  myr are nearly independent of the masses , the near - unity mass ratio means that the surface gravities of a and  b are very similar .",
    "@xcite present analytic fits to substellar evolutionary models that show the quantity @xmath25 is constant at fixed age . adopting  ranges of @xmath2113001400  k and @xmath2111001200  k for components  a and  b , respectively ( @xcite , which assumes an age of 3  gyr ) , the inferred difference in surface gravities is approximately 0.050.15  dex .",
    "we can make a rough estimate of the orbital period of ab , assuming that the true semi - major axis is not very different than the projected separation .",
    "( for example , @xcite show for binaries with a random distribution of orbital elements that on average the true semi - major axis is about 1.3@xmath26 larger than the projected semi - major axis . ) to estimate the total system mass , we use the 36  pc distance inferred from the composite spectra fitting and the aforementioned @xmath22 to estimate bolometric luminosities of @xmath27 and @xmath28  for the two components",
    ". models by @xcite give total masses for the system of about 60  , 85  , and 145  for assumed ages of 0.5 , 1.0 , and 5.0  gyr .",
    "for an assumed semi - major axis of 4.0  au , these mass estimates lead to an expected orbital period of 2233  years .",
    "more generally , @xcite shows that @xmath2185% of randomly oriented orbits have a true semi - major axis of 0.52.0@xmath26 the projected separation , corresponding to a range of orbital periods of @xmath21895  yr for ab .",
    "the rapid changes in near - ir colors at the l / t transition are generally understood to be due to a change in the photospheric dust content , but the very abrupt nature of this effect over a small inferred range in effective temperature remains a challenge to theoretical models .",
    "one key observational characteristic of the l / t transition is the unusual strong ( @xmath101  mag ) brightening of the @xmath1-band flux among the early and mid - t  dwarfs compared to the late - l  dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this brightening is also seen at far - red ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) and other near - ir wavelengths ( @xmath2 and @xmath11 ) , though the effect is greatest at @xmath1-band .",
    "this wavelength dependence is expected , since at @xmath1-band the photospheric opacities are most sensitive to the properties of the clouds @xcite .",
    "models can qualitatively accomodate the observed transition from the very red l  dwarfs to the very blue t  dwarfs @xcite .",
    "but no model thus far has succcessfully reproduced the observed @xmath1-band brightening along a single evolutionary track . based on a suggestion by @xcite , @xcite",
    "show that disruption of the condensate clouds at fixed  could produce an enhancement of the @xmath1-band flux , as holes in the cloud deck reveal the deeper , hotter regions of the photosphere .",
    "@xcite speculate that a rapid increase in the dust sedimentation efficiency over a small range of  could be responsible .",
    "however , as pointed out by @xcite , these explanations are ad hoc , lacking a firm physical basis for the rapid transition .",
    "a very different picture is suggested by @xcite .",
    "they propose that the @xmath1-band brightening does not occur along the evolutionary track of a given object .",
    "rather , in their `` unified cloudy model '' the  at which the l  dwarf sequence merges with the t  dwarf sequence depends on surface gravity : for younger or lower - mass objects , the l / t transition occurs at younger ages and brighter @xmath1-band absolute magnitudes than for older or higher - mass objects .",
    "thus , in their models the @xmath1-band brightening arises from the mass and age spreads within the known ensemble of l  and t  dwarfs and does not occur during the evolution of a single object .",
    "objects that comprise the @xmath1-band brightening are predicted to be younger and to have lower surface gravities than objects which do not ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "the flux crossover in the near - ir that we observe in ab provides a benchmark for understanding the @xmath1-band brightening , as the binary presumably constitutes a system of common age and metallicity and nearly identical surface gravity .",
    "this crossover can not be explained by the aforementioned unified cloudy model of @xcite .",
    "their model isochrones show that no @xmath1-band brightening occurs for a coeval population , in disagreement with our observations of ab .",
    "the fact that ab displays the @xmath1-band brightening between its two coeval components reveals that the phenomenon can originate from processes intrinsic to ultracool photospheres with very similar surface gravities , such as the aforementioned cloud disruption and/or rapid dust settling scenarios .- band brightening . ]",
    "similarly , models by @xcite indicate that variations in metallicities among the observed  l and t  dwarfs could be responsible for the @xmath1-band brightening ( though this is not the preferred solution of burrows et al . ) .",
    "ab demonstrates that objects of the same metallicity can exhibit the @xmath1-band brightening .",
    "a good point of comparison is the t  dwarf binary  bab .",
    "determined an integrated - light spectral type of approximately t2.5 using the @xcite classification scheme ; we analyzed the published spectrum and found that the type is unchanged with the newer @xcite scheme .",
    "the individual components of this 0.7  ( 2.6  au ) binary have spectral types of  t1 and  t6 on the burgasser et al .",
    "the near - ir colors are consistent with  ba having a comparable spectral type to a and  bb being about one  subclass later than b ( figure  2 ) . ,",
    "@xmath31 , and @xmath32 for components  a and  b , respectively .",
    "the resulting colors are @xmath330.03  mags different from the published values .",
    "] however , the flux ratios of  bab do not show the crossover seen between the t1.5 ad t5.5 components of ab .",
    "this suggests that by spectral type t6 the @xmath1-band brightening no longer occurs , consistent with the observed cmd of t  dwarfs ( and ignoring possible complications due to surface gravity effects , as the  system is somewhat younger [ 12  gyr ] than expected for field objects ) .",
    "the flux crossover seen in the near - ir for ab demonstrates that the @xmath1-band brightening is a true physical effect and not solely a manifestation of large physical variations among the l  and t  dwarfs with known distances ( unless b itself is an unresolved binary ) .",
    "however , the integrated - light photometry of  is in accord with the other @xmath1-band brightening objects ( figures 2 , 4 , and 5 ) , most of which have not yet been imaged at high angular resolution .",
    "this suggests that unrecognized binarity among early / mid - t  dwarfs may strongly affect the appearance of the @xmath1-band brightening in the brown dwarf cmd .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have recently noted that objects with spectral types of l7t2 appear to have a higher binary frequency relative to earlier - type l  dwarfs and mid / late - type t  dwarfs ( though a complete analysis of the selection biases is still needed ) .",
    "this finding covers an earlier spectral type range than the @xmath1-band brightening objects , but it does provide more evidence that binarity likely plays an important role in the l / t transition .    to examine this notion further , we consider here a scenario in which truly single @xmath1-band brightening objects are in fact rare .",
    "in this situation , it is the blended light of two components with different spectral types that produces an integrated - light spectral type of @xmath21t2t4.5 .",
    "thus , the binary frequency of these spectral subclasses is greater compared to other t  dwarfs , and the apparent amplitude of the @xmath1-band brightening effect is enhanced .",
    "@xcite suggested that the @xmath1-band brightening can not be due to unresolved binarity , because a significant number of objects contribute to the effect .",
    "however , their implicit assumption is that a given spectral subclass contains a mix of singles and binaries",
    ". their objection would not be relevant in our scenario , wherein the reason that most objects are classified as t2t4.5 is because they are binaries .",
    "the observed cmd of t  dwarfs lends some support to the idea that binarity might enhance the amplitude of the @xmath1-band brightening .",
    "unrecognized binarity can add up to 0.75  mag of scatter in the absolute magnitudes , in addition to scatter caused by other effects , e.g. , variations in surface gravity @xcite .",
    "therefore , we would naturally expect at least this much scatter in the absolute magnitudes at a given spectral subclass , and this is largely observed ( e.g. , figure 4 in this paper ; figure  2 of @xcite ; figure  9 of @xcite ; figure  8 of @xcite ) . however , the @xmath1-band brightening objects appear to have a _ smaller _ scatter in their absolute magnitudes compared to earlier and later spectral subclasses .",
    "this reduced scatter could be explained if in fact most @xmath1-band brightening objects are binaries , with truly single objects being rare .",
    "( an alternative explanation would be that the reduced scatter arises from a selection effect in the targets chosen by the parallax programs .",
    "however , it is not obvious what effect would act only on the @xmath1-band brightening objects and not the other subclasses . )    a similar hint , in a slightly different form , is seen in the effective temperatures of l  and t  dwarfs derived by @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that t2t4.5 dwarfs may have slightly higher temperatures than the late - l and t0t1 dwarfs ( see their figure  6 ) . while this discrepancy is within the uncertainties in the age estimates",
    "( which impact the model - derived radii used in the  calculation ) , the systematically higher s are a curious trend in the data , especially under the assumption that the spectral type scale is a proxy for the  scale ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "one possibility would be that the t2t4.5 dwarfs in golimowski et al .",
    "have systematically younger ages than the earlier or later - type objects , but again it is not obvious how such a selection bias would occur .",
    "a more natural explanation is that the elevated s result from unrecognized binarity .",
    "this is amply demonstrated by the l3  dwarf kelu-1 and the t0  dwarf sdss  j0423@xmath40414  their effective temperatures appear to to be anomalously large compared to objects of similar spectral types , but these deviations are in fact an artifact of previously unrecognized binarity @xcite . for the case of equal - luminosity components ,",
    "will be overestimated by about 20% ( @xmath34 ) ; applying this correction to the golimowski et al .",
    "t2t4.5 dwarfs would bring their temperatures into agreement with the earlier - type objects .",
    "in fact , if all the l  and t  dwarfs with anomolously high temperatures in the golimowski et al .  sample are actually unresolved binaries , we would infer that the @xmath1-band absolute magnitudes across the l / t transition are relatively constant ( figure  4 ) .",
    "similarly , the inflections in the brown dwarf cmds at other wavelengths would also be impacted .",
    "accounting for the possible binaries , figure  5 shows that the apparent plateau in the @xmath2 and @xmath11-band fluxes of the early / mid - t  dwarfs may be lessened , leading to a more monotonic dependence on on the spectral type .",
    "table  3 provides polynomial fits for the absolute magnitude as a function of spectral type , with and without the possible binaries .    at face value , a higher binary frequency among the @xmath21t2t4.5 objects relative to earlier and later - type objects may seem physically implausible . however , the binary frequency as a function of spectral type is not the same as the frequency as a function of .",
    "while the frequency as a function of  is expected to change smoothly , the frequency as a function of spectral type may not show the same behavior , since it also depends on how the light of individual binary components blends together .",
    "in particular , the large changes in spectral morphology and the non - monotonic behavior of the absolute magnitudes during the l / t transition may lead to interesting observational consequences when these objects form binaries . for the sake of illustration , if we consider an extreme example where truly single t2t4.5 objects do not exist at all , the ab ( t3.5 ) and  bab ( t2.5 ) systems demonstrate that these subclasses can be populated with binaries composed of an early and a late - type t dwarf  in this case , the t2t4.5 dwarfs would have a 100% binary fraction , even if the earlier and later - type t  dwarfs have much lower binary fractions .",
    "a relative paucity of single objects in the @xmath1-band brightening regime can be naturally explained if the corresponding  range is very small , e.g. , as suggested by @xcite and indicated by measurements from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the small  range would correspond to a relatively short - lived evolutionary phase , and therefore relatively few substellar objects would be found in the corresponding spectral subclasses .",
    "however , even if truly single @xmath21t2t4.5 objects are rare , a higher binary frequency among these objects may not be apparent in the spectral type distribution of objects found by 2mass and sdss .",
    "in such magnitude - limited surveys , the effective detection volume for binary stars is larger than for single stars , and thus a survey s observed spectral type distribution depends on several factors  the true binary frequency , the slope of the relationship between absolute magnitude and spectral type , and the effect of unresolved binarity on spectral types determined from integrated - light photometry and/or spectroscopy",
    ". a monte carlo simulation , beyond the scope of this paper , would be valuable in understanding the interplay of these effects .",
    "given that only six  t2t4.5 dwarfs have measured distances , the discussion here is inevitably speculative  such a small sample hinders more detailed considerations.0122 ( t2 ) ,  bab ( t2.5 in integrated light ) , sdss  j1021@xmath40304 ( t3 ) , sdss  j1750 + 1759 ( t3.5 ) , 2mass  j0559@xmath41404 ( t4.5 ) , and sdss  j0207 + 0000 ( t4.5 )  see compilation in @xcite .",
    "also , sdss  j0423@xmath40414 ( t0 in near - ir integrated light ) has recently been resolved into a binary by @xcite ; the components have estimated spectral types of l6@xmath01 and t2@xmath01 based on their near - ir fluxes and modeling of the combined - light spectrum . resolved @xmath18 magnitudes",
    "are not available for this system , so we estimate them for figures  4 and  5 by scaling template spectra of the individual components to the resolved optical fluxes . ]",
    "similarly , our adopted spectral range of @xmath21t2t4.5 for the strong @xmath1-band brightening phenomenon should be considered as approximate . the t  dwarf binaries ab ,  bab , and sdss  j0423@xmath40414ab all have components with estimated spectral types of t1t2 .",
    "unless these components are themselves binary , this shows that single early - t  dwarfs are not uncommon .",
    "indeed the positions of these components in brown dwarf cmds are quite similar ( figures  4 and  5 ) and are somewhat fainter than the t2  dwarf sdss  j1254@xmath40122 , which thus far appears to be a single object @xcite",
    ".    if binarity does play a significant role in the @xmath1-band brightening objects , there are some natural consequences .",
    "( 1 ) more extensive imaging surveys with _ hst _  and lgs ao should find a greater binary frequency among these objects compared to earlier and later - type objects , after accounting for selection effects inherent in current magnitude - limited samples of brown dwarfs .",
    "of course , some systems may have projected separations below the resolution limit of imaging surveys and would only be detectable as spectroscopic binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "( 2 ) such binaries should often be composed of an earlier - type object , say late - l to early - t , and an object of approximately t5 or later .",
    "( 3 ) more generally , the @xmath1-band brightening objects should have relatively lower space densities compared to other ultracool dwarfs . in this",
    "regard , a populous volume - limited sample of l  and t  dwarfs with trigonometric parallaxes would be valuable for studying the nature of the l / t transition .",
    "such a sample is unlikely to be achieved with current parallax programs , which can only target a limited number of pre - selected objects . the upcoming pan - starrs project @xcite will monitor the entire sky observable from hawaii with high astrometric precision ( planned 1-d rms astrometric error of 10  mas per observing epoch ) .",
    "the resulting dataset should be a promising means to assemble a large sample of brown dwarfs with accurate distances .",
    "we have obtained high angular resolution imaging of the t3.5  dwarf  using the keck sodium lgs ao system .",
    "is resolved into a 0.11  binary , and its low proper motion and distinctive optical / ir colors indicate that it is a physical pair .",
    "the resolved near - ir colors give estimated spectral types of t1.5@xmath00.5 and t5.5@xmath00.5 , consistent with modeling the integrated - light spectrum as the blend of two components .",
    "this analysis also produces an estimated distance of 36  pc , based on the distances to the mid - t  dwarfs used in the modeling .",
    "the inferred ( distance - independent ) differences in the masses and surface gravities of the two components are about 20% and 0.1  dex , respectively .",
    "sdss  j1534 + 1615ab serves as a new benchmark for understanding the @xmath1-band brightening seen among the early / mid - t  dwarfs .",
    "the binary s near - ir flux ratios show an inversion , wherein component  a is brighter at @xmath2 and @xmath11-bands but component  b is brighter at @xmath1-band by about 0.2  mags .",
    "thus , this binary system embodies the @xmath1-band brightening phenomenon seen in the cmd of t  dwarfs . since the components of  presumably have a common age , a common metallicity , and a very similar surface gravity , our results demonstrate that the @xmath1-band brightening is intrinsic to ultracool photospheres and not necessarily a by - product of observing an ensemble of brown dwarfs with different masses , ages , and/or metallicities .",
    "likewise , the brightening mechanism must be able to operate over a relatively small range ( @xmath21200  k ) in effective temperature .",
    "the magnitudes and colors of ab and the binary t  dwarf  bab are quite similar .",
    "however ,  bab , with resolved spectral types of t1 and t6 , does not show a crossover in its near - ir flux ratios , suggesting that the @xmath1-band brightening may end by around spectral type  t5 .    based on the limited observations to date ,",
    "we have considered the possibility that the large amplitude of the @xmath1-band brightening among early / mid - t  dwarfs is caused by a high frequency of unresolved binaries .",
    "ab and  bab provide examples of objects which appear to reside at / near the cmd location of the @xmath1-band brightening , but once their resolved properties are taken into account , the individual components are consistent with early - t s and mid / late - t s .",
    "we speculate that the possibly smaller scatter seen in the infrared cmds and the slightly higher s inferred for the @xmath21t2t4.5 dwarfs could be hints of unresolved binarity , leading to an enhancement in the apparent amplitude of the @xmath1-band brightening . in this interpretation , truly single @xmath21t2t4.5 objects would be relatively rare , with most objects of these spectral subclasses being composed of the blended light of an earlier and later - type component .",
    "this hypothesis is in accord with the small  range inferred for the late - l to mid - t subclasses ; photospheric dust removal seems to occur very rapidly during the l / t transition .    further study of ab will shed light on the nature of the l / t transition and the @xmath1-band brightening .",
    "a trigonometric parallax will accurately determine the cmd positions of the combined system and individual components .",
    "resolved spectroscopy of the two components will allow for more accurate spectral classification .",
    "also , given the common metallicity and similar surface gravities of the two components , such data can isolate the temperature - sensitive and dust - sensitive features in the spectra of the early / mid - t  dwarfs .",
    "given the estimated @xmath1028  yr period , follow - up high angular resolution imaging over the next several years can trace a significant fraction of the orbital motion and lead to a dynamical mass estimate . ultimately , a much larger sample of t  dwarf binaries from _ hst _ , lgs ao , and ir radial velocities will provide the means to fully explore the physical processes encapsulated in the substellar color - magnitude diagram .",
