    "a gravitating mass that traverses a sea of other particles builds up an overdense wake behind it .",
    "this wake tugs back on the mass , providing an effective drag .",
    "the background sea may itself consist of non - interacting point masses .",
    "for this collisionless case , @xcite first derived the dynamical friction force .",
    "his celebrated result has since found application in a great many astrophysical problems , ranging from mass segregation in dense star clusters @xcite to planet migration through interaction with planetesimals @xcite .",
    "the background environment may also be an extended gas cloud .",
    "this type of dynamical friction has also been invoked in a variety of contexts , such as black hole mergers in galactic nuclei @xcite , the heating of the intracluster medium by infalling galaxies @xcite , and the migration of giant planets within a protoplanetary disk @xcite . when the ambient medium is a gas , pressure gradients influence the formation of the wake behind the gravitating object .",
    "surprisingly , the general determination of gaseous dynamical friction , for arbitrary mach number of the perturbing mass , has not yet been achieved .",
    "there is substantial agreement when the mass is traveling hypersonically with respect to the gas . in this limit",
    ", the force varies as @xmath3 , where @xmath2 is the speed of the perturber @xcite .    in all studies thus far , the authors first calculated the properties of the wake by treating it as a linear perturbation of the background gas .",
    "the density perturbation is symmetric upstream and downstream when the mass is moving subsonically @xcite , leading @xcite to conclude that the friction force is zero in this case .",
    "@xcite obtained the force through direct integration over surrounding fluid elements , using their respective density enhancements .",
    "she added the constraint that the projectile s gravitational field only be switched on for a finite time interval @xmath4 . with this device",
    ", she first found a nonzero result even in the subsonic regime .",
    "the force increases with @xmath2 , and logarithmically diverges at a mach number of unity .",
    "interestingly , the quantity @xmath4 does not appear in ostriker s final expression for the subsonic force .",
    "this fact indicates that the artifice of a finite time interval was unnecessary and that a steady - state analysis is applicable .",
    "indeed , the force attains a steady - state value in the numerical simulations of @xcite .",
    "the divergence at a mach number of unity in the analytical expression further suggests that physical understanding of the problem is incomplete .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the subject of dynamical friction , concentrating entirely on the less studied subsonic case .",
    "we take the perturbing body to be a point mass @xmath5 traveling through an initially uniform gas .",
    "the previous studies cited also ostensibly dealt with point masses , in the sense that the physical size of the body was ignored .",
    "however , it was assumed , either tacitly or explicitly , that the object s radius @xmath6 far exceeds the accretion radius @xmath7 , conventionally defined as .",
    "it is true that when , the gravitational force from the object is so weak that mass accretion by infall is negligible . under these circumstances , however , the primary drag on the body is not from dynamical friction , but from direct impact by the gas , a fact sometimes overlooked .",
    "the conventionally assumed inequality marginally holds in one situation commonly envisioned , galaxies within intracluster gas ( ) .",
    "however , it fails badly in other contexts , e.g. , supermassive black holes within galaxies ( , ) or gas giant planets inside circumstellar disks ( , ) .",
    "when , as we assume here , dynamical friction is indeed the main drag force .",
    "the relative density enhancement in the wake is not small , as needed for linear theory ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and mass accretion can not be neglected .",
    "our analysis indeed pivots on the fact that the transfer of linear momentum from the background gas to the object , which underlies the friction force , is closely related to the transfer of mass .",
    "the problem of gas accretion onto a moving body was addressed in a classic series of papers by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the final result for the accretion rate , applicable for all mach numbers , is the interpolation formula offered by @xcite . while not derived rigorously , the formula matches known results in the hypersonic and stationary limits , and is broadly consistent with numerical simulations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the strategy in our paper is to determine , using perturbation theory , the density and velocity of the gas .",
    "however , we focus not on the wake , as in previous studies , but on a region _ far _ from the object , where its gravity is relatively weak . extending the perturbation analysis into the nonlinear regime , we calculate the net momentum flux onto the accreting object and derive analytically that the force from dynamical friction is @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the mass accretion rate onto the object . adopting an analytic form for this rate , the drag force follows .",
    "this force first rises with @xmath2 and then falls , remaining finite at all mach numbers .",
    "moreover , there is a contribution from the direct accretion of fluid momentum onto the body .",
    "this contribution is absent in the stellar dynamical problem , but is here comparable to the gravitational tug from the wake .    in section  [",
    "sec : method ] below , we introduce a perturbative series expansion to analyze the far - field density and velocity . in section  [ sec :",
    "outer ] , we use this expansion to derive a hierarchy of dynamical equations , of which we need only solve the first two sets .",
    "section  [ sec : mass ] shows how the mass accretion rate is connected to solutions of our second - order equations . in section",
    "[ sec : friction ] , we similarly relate the friction force to these solutions , and derive the central connection between this force and the accretion rate . using a modified version of the bondi interpolation formula for the latter ,",
    "we find explicitly the deceleration of an isolated mass in section  [ sec : velocity ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : summary ] compares our result with existing numerical simulations and suggests future avenues of inquiry .",
    "let the gravitating mass @xmath5 travel in a straight line with speed @xmath2 through the extended gas cloud .",
    "following previous analytic studies of dynamical friction , we assume the gas to be isothermal , with an associated sound speed @xmath9 . very far from the mass ,",
    "the density is spatially uniform and has the value @xmath10 .",
    "we choose a reference frame whose origin is anchored on the perturbing mass . in this frame , it is the gas that has speed @xmath2 far from the mass .",
    "we let the gas velocity be directed along the @xmath11-axis , and employ spherical coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coord ] ) .",
    "we now seek a steady - state , axisymmetric solution for the flow , which is taken to be inviscid .",
    "we neglect the self - gravity of the gas , and assume that each fluid element feels only a pressure gradient and the gravitational pull of the point mass .    strictly speaking",
    ", there is no steady flow , as this mass decelerates and @xmath2 continually changes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "what , then , is the meaning of the force we are calculating ?",
    "imagine the object being dragged by a massless string through the gas at the fixed speed @xmath2 .",
    "after a long time , a steady - state flow is indeed established throughout the surrounding gas , and the tension in the string approaches a constant value .",
    "this limiting tension is the dynamical friction force being calculated here .",
    "return now to the actual case , in which there is no string and the mass decelerates . as stated previously , there is no global , steady - state flow .",
    "the flow is quasi - steady , however , within some distance over which the altered motion of the mass is communicated by sound waves .",
    "we shall quantify this distance later , after we have established the flow assuming steady - state conditions .",
    "one important property of the flow is that it is irrotational .",
    "euler s equation in steady state may be written @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fluid velocity , is the vorticity , and the bernoulli function @xmath16 is @xmath17 both the fluid speed and density approach constant values far from the mass .",
    "hence , @xmath16 is a spatial constant throughout the flow , and @xmath18 since @xmath15 is a poloidal vector , the vorticity @xmath19 is toroidal .",
    "the last equation then implies that , as claimed . we will not need to invoke the irrotational character of the flow until section  [ sec : friction ] , when we explicitly evaluate the dynamical friction force .    throughout our analysis",
    ", it will be more convenient to employ , not the vector fluid velocity @xmath20 , but the scalar stream function @xmath21 .",
    "we may recover the individual velocity components from the stream function through the standard relations @xmath22 where is the mass density .",
    "the velocity , as given by equations  ( [ eqn : ur ] ) and ( [ eqn : ut ] ) , automatically obeys mass continuity : @xmath23      far from the mass , as the density approaches @xmath10 , the velocity has only a @xmath11-component , which is @xmath2 .",
    "equivalently , we have in this limit and .",
    "it follows that the far - field limit of the stream function is @xmath24 for a more complete analysis of the flow in this region , we take equation  ( [ eqn : sfunc1 ] ) to represent the leading term of a perturbation expansion . introducing the sonic radius , we first rewrite equation  ( [ eqn : sfunc1 ] ) as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mach number of the projectile mass : @xmath27    our perturbation expansion of @xmath28 is then given by @xmath29 \\,\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , etc .",
    "are still unknown , nondimensional functions of @xmath26 and @xmath13 .",
    "similarly , we expand the density as @xmath34 \\,\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , etc .",
    "are also nondimensional functions of @xmath26 and @xmath13 , all yet to be found .",
    "both expansions are only valid for , the inequality that defines our outer region .",
    "we further assume that the physical radius of the object obeys .",
    "since the motion is subsonic ( ) , it follows that , so that mass accretion is significant .",
    "at this point , it is convenient to cast all our variables into nondimensional form .",
    "we let the fiducial radius , density , and speed be @xmath38 , @xmath10 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "similarly , the stream function is normalized to @xmath40 .",
    "then equations  ( [ eqn : ur ] ) and ( [ eqn : ut ] ) relating the velocity to the stream function remain the same nondimensionally .",
    "we shall not employ a new notation for nondimensional variables , but make it clear whenever we switch back to dimensional relations . with this convention , the nondimensional expansions for the stream function and density simplify to @xmath41    by adopting these perturbation expansions , we have effectively limited our analysis to the subsonic regime . for , we expect the fluid variables or their derivatives to be discontinuous across the mach cone , whose opening angle is given by ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it would thus be necessary to adopt two separate expansions for @xmath28 and @xmath42 , one inside and one outside the mach cone . to avoid this complication , and since we are primarily interested in the subsonic regime in any event , we assume that and retain the single expansions .      by symmetry , the upstream axis of the flow , defined by , is a streamline for any @xmath26-value",
    "that is , @xmath43 is independent of @xmath12 .",
    "the actual value of @xmath44 is immaterial , reflecting the fact that the full function @xmath21 can have an arbitrary additive constant without affecting the velocities . for convenience ,",
    "we set , and note from equation  ( [ eqn : f2 ] ) that @xmath45 already vanishes . from equation  ( [ eqn : psind ] ) for the general expansion , we require that , for , etc .",
    "a second set of boundary conditions pertains to the behavior of the velocity @xmath15 .",
    "let us focus again on the upstream axis .",
    "the righthand sides of both equations  ( [ eqn : ur ] ) and ( [ eqn : ut ] ) contain in the denominator .",
    "since the density @xmath42 is finite at , where vanishes , both and must tend to zero as @xmath13 approaches @xmath46 , at least as fast as .",
    "considering first , we see that , which properly vanishes .",
    "we must further demand that , for , etc . turning to",
    ", the term involving @xmath47 still goes to zero , while itself vanishes when taking the @xmath12-derivative of @xmath28 .",
    "we are already requiring that for all other @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the stipulation that implies that also vanishes at , so that @xmath49 does not diverge .    approaching the downstream axis",
    ", again vanishes as @xmath13 goes to zero . by analogous reasoning",
    ", we require that for , etc .",
    "to ensure the regularity of @xmath49 , we further need , for , etc . again",
    ", the term @xmath32 disappears when taking the @xmath12-derivative of @xmath28 , and there is no a priori restriction on .",
    "indeed , this quantity sets the mass accretion rate onto the moving body , as we later demonstrate . in summary ,",
    "our boundary conditions are : , for , etc .",
    ", and for , etc .",
    "our inviscid flow obeys euler s equation , which we write in spherical coordinates .",
    "the @xmath12- and @xmath13-components of this vector equation are @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath49 are given in terms of @xmath28 by equations  ( [ eqn : ur ] ) and ( [ eqn : ut ] ) .",
    "our strategy is to substitute the perturbation expansions  ( [ eqn : psind ] ) and ( [ eqn : rhond ] ) into euler s equations . for each power of @xmath12",
    ", we demand that its coefficients match . in this way",
    ", we will obtain a hierarchy of coupled equations for the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    before proceeding",
    ", we first note that @xmath51 and @xmath49 are both proportional to @xmath54 . to avoid expanding inverse powers of the density ,",
    "we multiply equations  ( [ eqn : eulerr ] ) and ( [ eqn : eulert ] ) through by @xmath55 . replacing the velocity components by derivatives of @xmath28 results in complex expressions that we shall not write out in full .",
    "we simply note , as an example , that the first lefthand term in the @xmath12-component of euler s equation is @xmath56 after substituting the series expansions for @xmath28 and @xmath42 , we find that the highest power of @xmath12 is @xmath57 . in this case , all the coefficients on both sides of euler s equations vanish identically .",
    "matching the coefficients of @xmath58 , we obtain the _ first - order _ equations . from the @xmath12-component of euler s equation",
    ", we find @xmath59 while the @xmath13-component yields @xmath60 in both of these equations and those that follow , a prime denotes a @xmath13-derivative .",
    "these equations govern the first non - trivial terms in the expansions for @xmath28 and @xmath42 .",
    "their solution , therefore , must be equivalent to that obtained through the more traditional , linear analysis . integrating equation  ( [ eqn : firstt ] ) , we find @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a constant , as yet undetermined . in the subsonic regime ,",
    "the denominator on the righthand side does not vanish for any @xmath13 , and @xmath35 remains finite .    substituting this expression for @xmath35 into ( [ eqn : firstr ] ) gives the equation obeyed by @xmath31 : @xmath63 a particular solution of this equation may be found through the method of variation of parameters .",
    "adding the two homogeneous solutions yields @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are also constants .",
    "we proceed to evaluate the constants through application of the boundary conditions .",
    "the requirement that gives @xmath67 similarly , we have , yielding @xmath68 it follows , from these last two relations , that and . finally , we have , from which we infer that .",
    "it may be verified that the boundary condition is then also satisfied .    in summary ,",
    "the first - order density and stream function perturbations are @xmath69 notice that at both and @xmath46 , implying that the density profile is flat ( i.e. , does not have a cusp ) on either the upstream or downstream axis .",
    "our expression for @xmath35 is consistent with the linear density perturbation obtained by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath70 diverges as @xmath71 approaches unity , signifying the birth of the mach cone .",
    "our @xmath31 , in combination with @xmath35 , yields the linear velocity components given in equations  ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:1storder ] displays the streamlines ( _ solid curves _ ) and isodensity contours ( _ dashed curves _ ) for the outer flow , including only the first - order perturbations . the light , dotted circle marks the sonic radius , ; the solution is only accurate well outside this sphere .",
    "notice how all curves and contours are symmetric about the plane .",
    "the streamlines , in particular , show the fluid veering toward the mass , but then turning away again .",
    "we can not detect true accretion of mass or linear momentum until we include the next higher - order perturbations .",
    "we next equate coefficients of @xmath72 in both components of euler s equation . from the @xmath12-component , equation  ( [ eqn : eulerr ] )",

    ", we may find @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we thus have a one - parameter family of outer flow solutions .",
    "in the upper panel of figure  [ fig:2ndfandg ] we display , for the representative value , three solutions of @xmath84 .",
    "we obtained each solution by assuming different values of @xmath82 .",
    "notice that @xmath85 vanishes on the upstream and downstream axes , implying again that the density profile is flat in both regions .",
    "notice also that all curves attain the same value at .",
    "that is , @xmath86 depends only on @xmath26 , and not on the prescribed initial condition @xmath82 .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig:2ndfandg ] shows the corresponding plots of @xmath87 .",
    "we see that in every case , ensuring regularity of @xmath51 on the downstream axis . this condition was not imposed a priori , but resulted automatically from integration of the governing equations .",
    "specifically , the coefficient of @xmath88 in equation  ( [ eqn : secondr2 ] ) includes @xmath89 , which diverges at .",
    "since all the other terms in this equation remain finite on the axis , @xmath90 is forced to zero .    which of these solutions is the true outer flow for gas that is accreting steadily onto the gravitating mass ? in principle , one could answer this question by continuing each solution inward , to see if the flow smoothly crosses the sonic surface , where .",
    "we shall not attempt such a calculation here .",
    "instead , we will proceed by determining generically the mass accretion rate that is associated with each outer solution .",
    "then , given the bondi prescription for this rate , we will indeed be able to select the physical solution for each @xmath26 .",
    "one could , in principle , equate coefficients of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , etc . , and thereby obtain the coupled equations linking higher - order @xmath52- and @xmath53-variables .",
    "we will now demonstrate , however , that the first- and second - order equations just presented are sufficient to establish the total accretion rate onto the mass .",
    "we will then relate , in section  [ sec : friction ] below , this infall rate to the desired friction force .    refer again to figure  [ fig : coord ] and",

    "recall that @xmath44 is actually a constant , independent of @xmath12 , and that we have set that constant to zero .",
    "we thus have @xmath94    to nondimensionalize this result , we first set the fiducial mass accretion rate to .",
    "after using the expansion of @xmath28 from equation  ( [ eqn : psind ] ) , we obtain the nondimensional equation @xmath95 one of our boundary conditions , ensuring regularity of @xmath49 on the downstream axis , is that for etc .",
    "since , we find the simple relation @xmath96    both sides in this equation are functions of @xmath26 , although we have not indicated the dependence explicitly . in any case , the relation confirms our expectation that the mass accretion rate is independent of the sphere s radius @xmath12 in steady - state motion . becomes inaccurate when @xmath12 is not much greater than unity .",
    "] we also now see that the higher - order variables @xmath33 , @xmath97 , etc .",
    "play no part in determining this rate .      now that we have tied the mass accretion rate to @xmath98 , we can immediately rule out a subset of outer flow solutions as being unphysical .",
    "figure  [ fig:2ndfandg ] shows that , for , @xmath98 is negative , corresponding to a net mass efflux . that such a situation is even possible emphasizes once more the need to extend the flow solution inward across the sonic surface .",
    "for this same choice of @xmath82 , the dotted curve in the lower panel of figure  [ fig:2ndfandg ] shows that .",
    "indeed , we have just found one example of a general result : the difference agrees in sign with @xmath98 .",
    "we now show that the two quantities are in fact equal , apart from a multiplicative factor .    our proof starts with the fact that the lefthand side of the second - order equation  ( [ eqn : secondt2 ] ) is a perfect derivative .",
    "specifically , @xmath99 turning to the righthand side of the same equation , we note first that @xmath100 is an even function of @xmath101 , while @xmath102 is an odd function . since @xmath103 depends only on @xmath100 , it has even symmetry .",
    "inspection shows that the righthand side of equation  ( [ eqn : secondt2 ] ) has odd symmetry .",
    "if we now integrate equation  ( [ eqn : secondt2 ] ) from to 0 , the righthand side vanishes because of the odd symmetry of the integrand .",
    "we find that @xmath104 since and , we have @xmath105 which we recast as @xmath106 recalling equation  ( [ eqn : mdotf0 ] ) that identifies @xmath98 as the mass accretion rate , we now see that this rate is proportional to the difference , upstream and downstream , of the second - order density perturbation .",
    "as @xmath26 approaches zero , these two perturbations become equal . indeed , the function @xmath84 is a constant ( equal to 1/2 ) in the limit , consistent with a spherically symmetric flow .      to establish the physically relevant flow solutions , we need to specify the accretion rate as a function of velocity .",
    "@xcite fully solved the problem .",
    "that is , he determined the complete distribution of density and velocity surrounding a mass at rest within a background gas .",
    "dimensionally , he found for the mass accretion rate @xmath107 where for the isothermal case of interest here . recasting the rate into nondimensional form ( recall section 4.1 ) , we have @xmath108 as one constraint on the general form of @xmath109 .",
    "prior to bondi s work , @xcite studied accretion onto a mass traveling through a zero - temperature gas .",
    "their dimensional result was @xmath110 noting that the mach number @xmath26 is effectively infinite in this case , the equivalent , nondimensional finding is @xmath111 @xcite later showed that this relation provides an upper bound to the accretion rate in the zero - temperature case .",
    "through more careful analysis of the wake , which here degenerates into an infinite - density spindle , they set the lower limit a factor of two smaller .",
    "the widely used interpolation formula of @xcite connects these limits , at least approximately .",
    "nondimensionally , the bondi prescription is @xmath112 in the low-@xmath26 limit , @xmath1 falls short of the isothermal result , but matches that for a polytrope .",
    "the high-@xmath26 limit reproduces the lower bound established by @xcite .",
    "since we are focusing on the subsonic regime within an isothermal gas , we want our low-@xmath26 limit to agree with the exact result .",

    "static _ portion of the force is @xmath122 adding these two pieces , we have , after nondimensionalization , @xmath123 where we have set the unit of force equal to .",
    "the integrand within the first , righthand term must be recast in terms of the stream function : @xmath124 we may now evaluate @xmath119 using the series expansions for @xmath28 and @xmath42 .",
    "the full expression is a series of terms proportional to @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , etc .",
    "all terms in @xmath119 containing positive powers of @xmath12 vanish upon integration .",
    "those proportional to @xmath126 involve @xmath31 and @xmath35 , both of which are known explicitly .",
    "terms associated with negative powers of @xmath12 contain @xmath52- and @xmath53-variables which we have not yet calculated ( e.g. , @xmath33 , @xmath37 ) .",
    "however , as we consider ever larger radii @xmath12 , where the series expansions themselves become increasingly accurate , these terms also go to zero",
    ". only those independent of @xmath12 survive .    after restricting ourselves to @xmath12-independent terms",

    "all of these terms are antisymmetric with respect to ( i.e. , they are odd functions ) , and therefore vanish upon integration .      by dimensional considerations ,",
    "the friction force should be , where @xmath62 is dimensionless . in the hypersonic limit",
    ", this multiplicative factor contains a coulomb logarithm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we now demonstrate the surprising fact that , in the subsonic case of interest here , the factor is exactly unity . in fully nondimensional language , we shall prove that @xmath129    we begin by splitting the integral on the righthand side of equation  ( [ eqn : friction ] ) into two parts :    @xmath130\\ ! d\\theta \\\\",

    "we have further defined @xmath132 \\,\\,.\\ ] ] we next show that @xmath133 vanishes .",
    "first recall that our flow is irrotational .",
    "specifically , the @xmath134-component of the vorticity vanishes , so that @xmath135 expressing both velocity components in terms of the stream function through equations  ( [ eqn : ur ] ) and ( [ eqn : ut ] ) , we have @xmath136    we substitute the series expansions for @xmath28 and @xmath42 into this last equation and set the coefficients of all powers of @xmath12 to zero . following this procedure for @xmath125 and @xmath126 , and using the known expressions for @xmath47 , @xmath31 , and @xmath35 , yields identities .",
    "however , setting the @xmath12-independent terms to zero leads to a nontrivial result : @xmath137    we add this last equation to the second - order equation  ( [ eqn : secondr2 ] ) , obtaining @xmath138 multiplying through by gives @xmath139 integrating over @xmath13 , we recognize the lefthand side of the resulting equation as @xmath133 .",
    "the righthand side vanishes , since the integrand is an odd function .",
    "we see therefore that equation ( [ eqn : mdotv ] ) holds .",
    "if we now employ the modified bondi prescription , equation  ( [ eqn : intermdot ] ) for @xmath1 , we have an explicit expression for the force : @xmath140 figure  [ fig : friction ] displays the function @xmath141 .",
    "also shown , as the dashed curve , is the result from @xcite in which the force diverges as @xmath71 approaches unity . in the limit of low @xmath71 ,",
    "both forces rise linearly from zero at @xmath142 , but our initial slope is larger by a factor of @xmath143 .",
    "indeed , over most @xmath71-values , our force exceeds that derived by @xcite , presumably because we have included both the gravitational tug from the wake and the direct accretion of momentum from the flow .",
    "our force does not rise monotonically but instead peaks around @xmath144 and then begins to decline ; we expect this decline to continue into the supersonic regime .",
    "we should bear in mind that , while equation  ( [ eqn : mdotv ] ) is exact , equation  ( [ eqn : bondifric ] ) for @xmath119 is only as accurate as the underlying interpolation formula .",
    "our simple result for the dynamical friction force means that the deceleration of the gravitating mass is also simply described , as long as there are no other forces at play .",
    "as we have stressed , the force is the rate at which gas transfers linear momentum to the object .",
    "but the object s momentum is @xmath145 , where we now revert to dimensional variables . in the reference frame where the background gas is stationary",
    ", we have @xmath146 which implies that @xmath147 if @xmath148 and @xmath149 are the object s initial speed and mass , respectively , then @xmath150    to track the speed as a function of time , we rewrite equation  ( [ eqn : intermdot ] ) for the mass accretion rate as @xmath151 here , as before , while @xmath38 is now defined in terms of the _ initial _ mass : .",
    "the fully nondimensional evolutionary equation for the speed is then @xmath152 in this last equation , we have introduced the initial , nondimensional speed @xmath153 , as well as a nondimensional time , , where @xmath154 the denominator in equation ( [ eqn : veltime ] ) is the fiducial mass accretion rate defined in section 4.1 .",
    "thus , @xmath155 is of order the accretion time onto the initial mass .",
    "the upper panel of figure  [ fig : massvel ] plots @xmath156 for and 0.8 , obtained by numerical integration of equation  ( [ eqn : velocity ] ) . also shown , in the lower panel , is the growth of the nondimensional quantity @xmath5 , the mass of the gravitating body relative to its initial value .",
    "as expected , the body slows down appreciably within an accretion time .",
    "this study has pivoted on the close relationship between the dynamical friction force , i.e. , the transfer of linear momentum from gas to a gravitating object , and the transfer of mass to that same object .",
    "this relationship is embodied in our central result , equation  ( [ eqn : mdotv ] ) . from this equation , in turn , we derived an analytic expression for the force itself , equation  ( [ eqn : bondifric ] ) .",
    "we are now in a position to address a basic question raised in section  2.1 . how are we justified in assuming steady - state flow , when the gravitating body is continually decelerating ?",
    "the answer is that quasi - steady flow is established within a radius @xmath157 over which the sound crossing time ( @xmath158 ) equals the time for the object s momentum to decrease appreciably ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "recalling that @xmath119 is normalized to @xmath160 and using equation ( [ eqn : mdotv ] ) , we have , nondimensionally , @xmath161 where .",
    "the latter quantity was implicitly assumed to be large from the start , when we neglected the self - gravity of the gas .",
    "the nondimensional mass accretion rate hovers near unity for the entire evolution ( recall  fig .",
    "[ fig:2ndg ] ) , while @xmath5 itself starts at unity and climbs .",
    "hence , the critical radius is much larger than @xmath38 , and our analysis is self - consistent .",
    "we note that dynamical friction still operates in circumstances where mass accretion is frustrated .",
    "for example , a wind - emitting star moving through a gas cloud experiences mass loss rather than mass gain .",
    "cloud gas impacting the wind upstream is arrested or refracted in a bowshock , as analytically calculated by @xcite .",
    "downstream , the wind forms a supersonic jet .",
    "as long as the upstream standoff radius of the shock lies within @xmath38 and the downstream jet is relatively narrow , the far - field perturbations are close to what we have obtained , and equation  ( [ eqn : bondifric ] ) for @xmath119 still applies .",
    "when the object is actually able to accept gas freely , dynamical friction arises in two physically distinct ways .",
    "first , there is the gravitational tug from the wake .",
    "second , momentum is transferred directly to the object by gas falling onto it .",
    "our finding that these two forces sum to @xmath0 is at least roughly consistent with simulations . in a numerical study directed primarily at the mass accretion issue",
    ", @xcite explicitly determined both force contributions on accretors of various size in a gas . for and , the simulation ended before the flow reached steady - state ( see his fig .",
    "after initial transients died out , the gravitational drag was steady until @xmath162 , where the bondi - hoyle time @xmath163 is @xmath164 .",
    "thereafter , this force component declined for the rest of the integration . at the end of the simulation ( @xmath165 ) ,",
    "the sum of the gravitational drag and momentum accretion forces was @xmath166 . for and the same mach number , the two forces quickly leveled off , with a sum equal to @xmath167 . however , this simulation ran only until @xmath168 , so it is not clear whether the gravitational drag would have later declined , as in the first case .",
    "following historical precedent , we have restricted our investigation to an isothermal gas .",
    "for an isentropic gas with @xmath169 , it seems likely that the friction force will still be given by @xmath170 , as long as the accretor is moving subsonically .",
    "verifying this equality analytically would require a perturbation study analogous to the present one .",
    "we leave such a project for future investigators .",
    "again the current body of numerical studies is in broad accord with our expectation .",
    "@xcite determined the total friction force on an accretor moving through a @xmath171 gas . for and",
    "@xmath172 , the friction force was @xmath173 at @xmath174 . for and",
    "the same mach number , the flow had not achieved steady state by @xmath175 .",
    "the total force was @xmath176 at this time , but was falling rapidly .",
    "a future project of interest would be to redo these simulations over a range of @xmath26- and @xmath177-values , running the simulations long enough until a true steady state is reached .    for the more general isentropic case , @xmath118",
    "can no longer be approximated by equation ( [ eqn : intermdot ] ) .",
    "instead the value of @xmath118 at a given @xmath2 decreases with higher @xmath177-values , as shown analytically by @xcite for @xmath178 , and as seen in the simulations of @xcite for accretors moving relative to the background gas .",
    "isentropic flows are less compressible than isothermal ones , so the wake will be less dense . as a result",
    ", the friction force will also be lower , presumably by the same amount as the accretion rate @xmath118 .",
    "in the present investigation , we have been unable to tease apart analytically the two force contributions .",
    "to do so would require study of the flow closer to the gravitating mass , specifically across the sonic surface . in principle",
    ", a perturbation series in this region could be linked to the outer one developed here .",
    "besides elucidating the momentum transfer through infall , such a study could also establish @xmath1 analytically as a function of velocity , thus putting accretion theory as a whole on a firmer foundation .",
