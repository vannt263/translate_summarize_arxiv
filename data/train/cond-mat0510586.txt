    "<S> we investigate the electronic instabilities of the small - diameter ( 3,3 ) carbon nanotubes by studying the low - energy perturbations of the normal luttinger liquid regime . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonization approach is adopted to deal exactly with the interactions in the forward - scattering channels , while renormalization group methods are used to analyze the low - energy instabilities . in this respect , we take into account the competition between the effective e - e interaction mediated by phonons and the coulomb interaction in backscattering and umklapp channels . moreover , we apply our analysis to relevant experimental conditions where the nanotubes are assembled into large three - dimensional arrays , which leads to an efficient screening of the coulomb potential at small momentum - transfer . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the destabilization of the normal metallic behavior takes place through the onset of critical behavior in some of the two charge stiffnesses that characterize the luttinger liquid state . from a physical point of view , this results in either a divergent compressibility or a vanishing renormalized velocity for current excitations at the point of the transition . </S>",
    "<S> we observe anyhow that this kind of critical behavior occurs without the development of any appreciable sign of superconducting correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of nanoscale technology during the last decade has attracted much attention on carbon nanotubes , which are among the most promising candidates to fabricate molecular - size devices . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to the wide variety of their electronic and transport properties , which can result in metallic@xcite , semiconducting@xcite or even superconducting behavior@xcite , depending on geometry and the way of assembling .    </S>",
    "<S> > from a theoretical point of view , the confinement of electrons in the longitudinal dimension of the nanotubes induces the so - called luttinger liquid behavior@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is characterized , for instance , by the power - law dependence of the differential conductance , which has been actually observed experimentally@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior breaks down anyhow at sufficiently low temperature , and the nanotubes enter a different regime , usually driven by the quality of the contacts in the experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the case of very transparent contacts , it has been observed that carbon nanotubes may develop superconducting correlations , inherited from superconducting electrodes ( proximity effect)@xcite as well as intrinsic to large assemblies of massive ropes@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the superconducting instability is anyway in competition with the so - called peierls ( or charge - density - wave ) instability , which may induce a metallic - semiconducting transition caused by a lattice distorsion . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field temperature @xmath0 of such a transition has been estimated by means of detailed calculations , and it is predicted to increase as the radius of the nanotubes becomes smaller@xcite . for tubes of typical radius , </S>",
    "<S> calculations find a very low ( undetectable ) value of @xmath0 , while for thinner nanotubes it is predicted to be significantly larger and competing with the superconducting critical temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , superconductivity at about 15 k has been claimed to occur in @xmath1  - diameter nanotubes@xcite . in the experiment reported in ref . </S>",
    "<S> , a strong diamagnetic behavior was interpreted as an anisotropic meissner effect , while a genuine superconducting transition was not observed . </S>",
    "<S> this has opened some controversy on this issue , since _ ab initio _ simulations predict a room - temperature peierls transition in the allowed @xmath1 - diameter geometries , namely in the ( 5,0)@xcite and the ( 3,3 ) nanotubes@xcite . on the other hand , mean - field calculations for the ( 5,0 ) nanotubes </S>",
    "<S> seem to find a superconducting instability , but with a critical temperature of about 1 k@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we investigate the low - energy properties of the ( 3,3 ) nanotubes by focusing on the instabilities of the luttinger liquid behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we study carefully the competition between the effective e - e interaction mediated by phonons and the coulomb repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonization technique is applied in order to deal exactly with the interactions in the forward - scattering channels , while renormalization group methods are used to approach the low - energy instabilities of the system , driven by the backscattering and umklapp interactions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we pay also special attention to the experimental conditions reported in ref . , which lead to large arrays of nanotubes embedded in a zeolite matrix . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to a large screening of the coulomb potential , which has no counterpart in the case of single nanotubes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we study this effect by means of a generalized rpa approach , showing that the long - range intertube coupling produces an efficient screening of the intratube interactions with small momentum - transfer .    the most important result of the present study is the finding of two different low - energy phases characterized by critical ( nonanalytic ) behavior of the physical observables . </S>",
    "<S> under the conditions corresponding to the experimental samples described in ref . , the critical behavior is related to the vanishing of one of the luttinger liquid parameters , and it is qualitatively consistent with the large diamagnetic signal observed in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> we also observe that this kind of singularity occurs well before the development of any sizeable superconducting or charge - density - wave correlations in the electron system .    </S>",
    "<S> we start by paying attention to the interactions mediated by the coulomb potential , which provides a strong source of repulsion between electrons in single nanotubes . in the tubular nanotube geometry </S>",
    "<S> , the coulomb potential is given by@xcite @xmath2+a_{z}^{2 } } } \\label{potent}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the nanotube radius . </S>",
    "<S> the screening by the environment of external charges is in general encoded in the dielectric constant @xmath5 . for the sake of studying the nanotube transport properties </S>",
    "<S> , it is more convenient do deal with the one - dimensional ( 1d ) projection of the potential onto the longitudinal dimension of the nanotube . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by integration of the circular coordinate , upon which we obtain the 1d coulomb potential @xmath6 depending on the longitudinal momentum - transfer @xmath7 @xcite @xmath8 @xmath9 is in general of the order of the inverse of the nanotube radius @xmath4 , as it is the memory that the 1d projection keeps of the finite transverse size .    </S>",
    "<S> the relative strength of the coulomb interaction is given by the dimensionless ratio between @xmath10 and the fermi velocity @xmath11 , which for the ( 3,3 ) nanotubes is approximately @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the coloumb potential should give the dominant interaction in the forward - scattering channels , at least in single nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> the processes can be classified depending on the low - energy linear branches involved in the electron - electron scattering@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we recall at this point that the low - energy modes of the ( 3,3 ) nanotubes lie in a bonding and an antibonding subband that cross at two fermi points ( in the undoped system ) with opposite longitudinal momenta@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we can distinguish in particular four forward - scattering channels , labelled by their respective couplings as represented in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ g4424 ] and [ g2242 ] . in these processes </S>",
    "<S> there is a nominally strong coulomb repulsion between the electrons , as they scatter without change of their chirality and the interaction strength is simply given by the coulomb potential ( [ coulomb ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction channels represented in figs . [ g4424 ] and [ g2242 ] are only part of the complete catalogue of scattering processes , that may be classified according to the chiralities and momentum - transfer for the interacting electrons@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has become usual to assign respective coupling constants @xmath13 to the interaction channels , in such a way that the lower index discerns whether the interacting particles shift from one fermi point to the other @xmath14 , remain at different fermi points @xmath15 , or they interact near the same fermi point @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper label follows the same rule to classify the different combinations of left - movers and right - movers , including the possibility of having umklapp processes @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> as we will see , the couplings for the channels with large momentum - transfer @xmath18 or change of chirality of the interacting electrons have an strength which is sensibly smaller than that of the forward - scattering couplings represented in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ g4424 ] and [ g2242 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> a very important point is that the system with just the forward - scattering interactions @xmath19 and @xmath20 is exactly solvable by means of bosonization techniques@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , no matter that the coulomb repulsion may place these interaction channels in the strong - coupling regime , the availability of an exact solution makes possible to capture the nonperturbative effects coming from the coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonization techniques make use of the fact that the forward - scattering interactions can be written in terms of the electron density operators corresponding to the different electron fields @xmath21 for the linear branches shown in fig . [ bran ] . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt a notation in which the index @xmath22 is used to label the left- or right - moving character of the linear branch , and the index @xmath23 to label the fermi point . </S>",
    "<S> the index @xmath24 stands for the two different spin projections . </S>",
    "<S> we may actually introduce the charge and spin density operators @xmath25 as long as the coulomb interaction and the interaction mediated by exchange of phonons do not depend on the spin of the interacting electrons , we will carry out the subsequent discussion in terms of the charge density operators @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient , for instance , to introduce operators for the sum and the difference of charge densities in the bonding and the antibonding subbands of the armchair nanotubes : @xmath27 in terms of these operators , the hamiltonian for the forward - scattering interactions can be written in the form @xmath28 where @xmath9 stands again for the momentum cutoff dictated by the transverse size of the nanotube .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the symmetric and the antisymmetric combination of the charge operators in the two low - energy subbands decouple in the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this can be completely diagonalized by first introducing boson fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( and their respective conjugate momenta , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) defined by @xmath33 the hamiltoninan can be rewritten then in the form @xmath34 with renormalized velocities @xmath35 and charge stiffnesses @xmath36 given by the expressions @xmath37    upon application of the canonical transformation @xmath38 the hamiltonian ( [ hlutt ] ) becomes that of a couple of noninteracting boson fields . </S>",
    "<S> this picture , in which the low - energy excitations are just given by charge fluctuations ( and spin fluctuations with unrenormalized velocity ) , is what characterizes the luttinger liquid regime of the electron system@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the charge stiffnesses and the renormalized velocities in the two different charge sectors dictate for instance the thermodynamic and transport properties , encoded into the compressibilities @xmath39 , the drude weights @xmath40 and the dependence of the specific heat @xmath41 on the temperature @xmath42@xcite : @xmath43    the above picture will be complemented later by including the effect of the backscattering and umklapp interactions , that tend to destabilize the luttinger liquid regime at low temperatures . at this point , we stress that the robustness of such a regime depends on the strength of the coulomb interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the consideration of the screening effects induced by the environment becomes then quite relevant , specially in the case of a large assembly of nanotubes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the nanotube array described in ref . , the long - range coulomb repulsion gives rise to a nonnegligible interaction between electronic currents in different nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> if we label these by their respective positions @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the transverse section of the array , the intertube coulomb potential can be expressed as @xmath46 where @xmath7 denotes the longitudinal momentum - transfer . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the bessel function @xmath47 is logarithmically divergent in the limit @xmath48 . for @xmath49 , </S>",
    "<S> there is implicit a short - distance cutoff given by the radius of the nanotube , which leads then to the potential ( [ coulomb ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the important point is that the intertube coulomb potential gives rise to quite significant screening effects at small momentum - transfer , which modify appreciably the strength of the forward - scattering couplings described above .    in order to take into account the interaction among all the nanotubes in the array </S>",
    "<S> , we can adopt a generalization of the rpa scheme used in ref . </S>",
    "<S> for the study of 2d layered sytems . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , the screened coulomb potential @xmath50 has to satisfy the self - consistent diagrammatic equation shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ self ] , with @xmath51 running over all the positions of the nanotubes in the array . </S>",
    "<S> we have then @xmath52 where @xmath53 stands for the polarization of each 1d electron system . </S>",
    "<S> this function is known exactly at small momentum - transfer@xcite , and here it appears multiplied by the number of subbands @xmath54 contributing at low - energies : @xmath55    equation ( [ dyson ] ) can be easily solved by introducing the fourier transform of the coulomb potential with respect to the nanotube position @xmath44 in the 2d transverse section of the array . </S>",
    "<S> we define for instance @xmath56 by @xmath57 where @xmath58 stands for the nanotube separation and @xmath59 denotes that the integration is over the brillouin zone for the nanotube lattice in the transverse section of the array . </S>",
    "<S> we define similarly @xmath60 as the fourier transform of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression of equation ( [ dyson ] ) becomes then in momentum space @xmath62 in what follows , we will stick to the solution of this equation at @xmath63 , for the sake of giving a simpler description of the screening effects in the static limit .    within our rpa scheme , </S>",
    "<S> the screened coulomb potential becomes finally @xmath64 the most important property of @xmath65 is that it saturates at a finite value in the limit @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a reflection of the fact that , for distances much larger than the nanotube separation , the array screens effectively the coulomb interaction as a 3d system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , taking a value of the bare coupling @xmath67 , we find that the intratube potential at vanishing momentum - transfer is @xmath68 ( for @xmath69 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value depends slightly on the dielectric constant , as represented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ intra - k ] . </S>",
    "<S> we will take this strength of the screened intratube coulomb potential at @xmath70 as an input for the values of the forward - scattering couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 within each nanotube in the array </S>",
    "<S> .    a closer look at the above analysis shows that the coulomb potential between nearest - neighbor nanotubes also gives rise to relevant interaction channels . </S>",
    "<S> the new couplings needed for a consistent description of the interaction processes are catalogued in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ gtilde ] . </S>",
    "<S> they adhere to the same rules used to label the intratube couplings , but with a tilde to distinguish their intertube character . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the intertube forward - scattering interactions @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( preserving the chirality of the electrons within each nanotube ) are affected by the screening effects described above , as they are corrected by the polarization of the different nanotubes in the array . </S>",
    "<S> their strength is given by the intertube coulomb potential , which keeps only a nonnegligible value between nearest - neighbor tubes , after screening by the nanotube array . </S>",
    "<S> taking again @xmath67 , the intertube potential for @xmath73 has a value at vanishing momentum - transfer @xmath74 ( for @xmath69 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of this strength on the dielectric constant is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ inter - k ] . </S>",
    "<S> although the relative strength of the intertube forward - scattering couplings @xmath71 and @xmath72 may appear small , these are however significant as they influence the scaling of the rest of interactions at low energies , as we will see in what follows .    on the other hand , the intertube chirality - breaking interactions @xmath75 and @xmath76 give rise to a different kind of screening processes , of the type represented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pol ] . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of these processes can not be captured in the rpa scheme described above , as the polarization with a change of chirality in the particle - hole pair diverges logarithmically at low energies . as long as the corrections depend on the 1d cutoff , they give rise instead to new screening contributions to the scaling equations for the rest of interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the scaling equations for the interactions of single armchair nanotubes have been obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> ( up to terms quadratic in the couplings ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that , after incorporating the corrections from the intertube interactions , the scaling equations for the intratube couplings become @xmath77 the variable @xmath78 stands for minus the logarithm of the energy ( temperature ) scale measured in units of the high - energy cutoff of the 1d model @xmath79 ( of the order of @xmath80 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the large coefficients in front of the intertube contributions arise from the number of nearest - neighbors of each nanotube in the 3d array . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we have also incorporated a nonperturbative improvement of the equations by writing the exact dependence of the scaling dimensions on the forward - scattering couplings , expressed in terms of the @xmath36 parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the new intertube interactions are themselves corrected by processes that diverge logarithmically at low energy , and that give rise to respective contributions to the scaling of the intertube couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we can focus on the analysis of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which have values given by the intertube potential ( [ intert ] ) at the initial stage of the low - energy scaling . as long as this potential decays exponentially for @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> , we can neglect the influence of other intertube interactions with @xmath82 momentum - transfer . </S>",
    "<S> the second - order diagrams that renormalize the above intertube couplings consist of particle - particle processes or particle - hole loops involving a change of chirality , as illustrated in figs </S>",
    "<S> . [ backs ] and [ umkl ] . </S>",
    "<S> some of the contributions depend on @xmath71 and @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that these couplings have to be taken into account for a consistent description of the low - energy scaling . </S>",
    "<S> the complete set of scaling equations for the intertube couplings becomes : @xmath83    following the flow of the scaling equations , the backscattering and umklapp interactions are progressively enhanced as the theory is scaled down to low energies . at the initial stage of the renormalization , </S>",
    "<S> the values of the couplings are dictated by the coulomb interaction and , in the case of intratube couplings , also by the effective interaction mediated by phonon - exchange . </S>",
    "<S> regarding the coulomb interaction , its contribution to forward - scattering couplings is given by the rpa calculation exposed above . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have @xmath84 , following the trend shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ intra - k ] , while @xmath85 , with the potential for nearest - neighbor @xmath86 represented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ inter - k ] . for the chirality - breaking processes , </S>",
    "<S> the different symmetry of ingoing and outgoing electron modes implies also a significant reduction of the coulomb potential , as evaluated in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that , for the armchair ( 3,3 ) nanotubes , there is a repulsive component in the backscattering and umklapp interactions at small momentum - transfer whose strength can be estimated as @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> this applies to the couplings @xmath88 and @xmath89 , as well as to the corresponding intertube couplings at small momentum - transfer . for the intratube couplings with the large momentum - transfer @xmath82 </S>",
    "<S> , the contribution by the coulomb interaction can be obtained from the fourier transform of the potential ( [ potent ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the strength estimated in this way turns out to be @xmath90 .    </S>",
    "<S> dealing now with the contribution from the effective phonon - mediated interaction , we note that the situation is reversed , and that the backscattering and umklapp couplings at vanishing momentum - transfer get a smaller component than the couplings for momentum - transfer around @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> previous estimates had already found that the ratio between these two different strengths is approximately 1/3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recent calculations of the phonon spectrum by means of density functional theory have led to a similar proportion@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , it has been found that the contributions of all the phonons with momentum - transfer @xmath82 add to an effective coupling @xmath91 , while the contributions of the phonons near the zone center give an effective coupling @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> these more accurate estimates are about three times smaller than those quoted in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> anyhow , we will consider the phase diagram of the ( 3,3 ) nanotubes by spanning a suitable range in the scale @xmath93 of the two effective couplings , covering the values between the different estimates in refs . and .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to determine the electronic instabilities that may appear at low energies , we have solved the set of scaling equations ( [ first])-([g22 ] ) , taking initial values for the couplings according to the above discussion . the couplings approach in general a regime where they grow large as @xmath94 . regarding the forward - scattering interactions </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath20 becomes increasingly repulsive , leading to a singularity characterized by either the vanishing of @xmath95 or the divergence of @xmath96 , depending on the region of the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling of the interactions stops at the low - energy scale @xmath97 corresponding to the point @xmath98 where the singularity is reached . </S>",
    "<S> this has actually the character of a critical point , since it gives rise to the opening of a branch cut and nonanalytic behavior in the corresponding luttinger liquid parameter @xmath95 or @xmath96@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fase ] the phase diagram of the ( 3,3 ) nanotubes showing the two different regions of singular behavior , as a function of the dielectric constant @xmath99 and the effective coupling @xmath93 of the phonon - mediated e - e interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , the enhancement of backscattering and umklapp interactions upon scaling may lead to a large growth of electron correlations , pointing at the tendency towards long - range order in the electron system . </S>",
    "<S> we have analyzed this possibility through the computation of different response functions @xmath100 where the pair field @xmath101 characterizes a particular type of ordering . in the system under consideration , </S>",

    "<S> the derivatives with respect to the frequency of the response functions obey actually scaling equations@xcite , whose solution allows to compare the relative growth of the different electron correlations . by looking at the low - energy scaling , </S>",
    "<S> we have checked however that none of the response functions shows a very large growth , down to the point where the scaling flow breaks down due to the singularity in the luttinger liquid parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this singular behavior occurs therefore before the appearance of any tendency to long - range order in the electron system . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated for a typical instance in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ susc ] , where it can be observed that only the cdw correlations with vanishing momentum show a significant growth as the critical point is approached .    </S>",
    "<S> the ( 3,3 ) carbon nanotubes may fall therefore into two different low - temperature phases , whose physical properties are dictated by the vanishing of @xmath107 and the divergence of @xmath96 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we remind in particular that , for the experimental setup of ref . , a reasonable choice of the parameters is @xmath108 and @xmath109 , corresponding to the @xmath110 phase . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of transition to the new phase results strongly dependent on the dielectric constant of the environment , ranging from @xmath111 k ( at @xmath112 ) to @xmath113 k ( at @xmath114 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the response functions follows in general the trend shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ susc ] and , while the density - wave correlations tend to grow by approaching the critical value @xmath115 , the superconducting correlations remain small anyhow . </S>",
    "<S> this finding seems to rule out the possibility of having superconducting correlations in the ( 3,3 ) nanotubes , at least under the physical conditions considered in the present paper . </S>",
    "<S> we coincide in this respect with the conclusions reached in previous analyses by means of other computational methods@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have found however that the appearance of a cdw instability is precluded by the breakdown of the luttinger liquid behavior , which cuts off the growth of the different correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the destabilization of the luttinger liquid is favored in this respect by the screening effects from the 3d array of nanotubes , which are responsible of bringing the coulomb interaction into the weak - coupling regime .    </S>",
    "<S> our results confront the claim that the experimental signatures reported in ref </S>",
    "<S> . should provide evidence for a superconducting transition in the small - diameter nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation has been also challenged by studies of the electron correlations in the ( 5,0 ) nanotubes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that , even considering the large screening effects from the arrays of nanotubes in the experimental samples , the effective e - e attraction arising from the exchange of phonons is not large enough to support the appearance of superconducting correlations in the ( 3,3 ) nanotubes . </S>",
    "<S> if the coulomb interaction is further screened by a suitable variation of the dielectric constant of the medium , the system is driven then into the phase characterized by the divergence of @xmath96 and the related compressibility @xmath116 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fase ] . </S>",
    "<S> this has the same character that the instability given by the wentzel - bardeen singularity , where the divergent compressibility is the signal of the spatial separation of the system into regions with different electron density@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> anyhow , the experimental conditions of the samples described in ref . seem to place the system in the region of the phase diagram characterized by the vanishing of @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the vanishing of the conductivity at the point of the transition , as follows from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ drude ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it also gives rise to the vanishing of the tunneling conductance , which is directly related to the tunneling density of states @xmath117 . within the luttinger liquid framework , the latter follows the low - energy behavior @xmath118 the depletion of the density of states given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dos ] ) at vanishing @xmath95 is consistent with the appearance of the pseudogap observed experimentally in the measures of the @xmath119-@xmath120 characteristics reported in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> the critical point characterized by the vanishing of @xmath95 does not describe however a conventional metal - insulator transition , as long as the compressibility given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ compr ] ) remains finite at the point of the transition . as analyzed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> , the critical point implies actually a divergent diamagnetic susceptibility , as a consequence of the development of very soft modes in the sector of electron current excitations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the phenomenology derived from the @xmath110 phase of the ( 3,3 ) carbon nanotubes seems to be consistent , at least qualitatively , with the main experimental signatures reported in ref . . </S>",
    "<S> further experimental work would be needed to clarify the existence of such a critical point in the ( 3,3 ) nanotubes , its physical properties , and its stability under changes of relevant experimental conditions . </S>"
