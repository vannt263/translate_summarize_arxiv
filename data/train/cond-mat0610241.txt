    "recently there has been increasing interest in the interaction between magnetic and electric degrees of freedom.@xcite much interest has centered on a family of multiferroics which display a phase transition in which uniform ferroelectric order appears simultaneously with incommensurate magnetic ordering .",
    "early examples of such a system whose ferroelectric behavior and magnetic structure have been thoroughly studied are terbium manganate , tbmno@xmath0 ( tmo).@xcite and nickel vanadate , ni@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 ( nvo)@xcite . a number of other systems have been shown to have combined magnetic and ferroelectric transitions,@xcite but the investigation of their magnetic structure has been less comprehensive .",
    "initially this combined transition was somewhat mysterious , but soon a landau expansion was developed@xcite to provide a phenomenological explanation of this phenomenon . an alternative picture , similar to an earlier result@xcite based on the concept of a  spin - current , \" and which we refer to as the `` spiral formulation,''@xcite has gained popularity due to its simplicity , but as we will discuss , the landau theory is more universally applicable and has a number of advantages .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to describe the landau formulation in the simplest possible terms and to apply it to a large number of currently studied multiferroics . in this way",
    "we hope to demystify this formulation .",
    "it should be noted that this phenomenon ( which we call  magnetically induced ferroelectricity \" ) is closely related to the similar behavior of so - called  improper ferroelectrics , \" which are commonly understood to be the analogous systems in which uniform magnetic order ( ferromagnetism or antiferromagnetism ) drive ferroelectricity.@xcite several decades ago such systems were studied@xcite and reviewed@xcite and present many parallels with the recent developments .",
    "one of the problems one encounters at the outset is how to properly describe the magnetic structure of systems with complicated unit cells .",
    "this , of course , is a very old subject , but surprisingly , as will be documented below , the full ramifications of symmetry are not widely known .",
    "accordingly , we feel it necessary to repeat the description of the symmetry analysis of magnetic structures .",
    "while the first part of this symmetry analysis is well known to experts , we review it here , especially because our approach is often far simpler and less technical than the standard one . however , either approach lays the groundwork for incorporating the effects of inversion symmetry , which seem to have been overlooked until our analysis of nvo@xcite and tmo.@xcite inversion symmetry was also addressed by schweizer with a subsequent correction.@xcite very recently a more formal approach to this problem has been given by radaelli and chapon.@xcite but , at least in the simplest cases , the approach initially proposed by us and used here seems easiest .",
    "we apply this formalism to a number of currently studied multiferroics , such as mnwo@xmath3 ( mwo ) , tbmn@xmath1o@xmath4 ( tmo25 ) , ymn@xmath1o@xmath4 ( ymo25 ) , and cufeo@xmath1 ( cfo ) . as was the case for nvo@xcite and tmo,@xcite",
    "once one has in hand the symmetry properties of the magnetic order parameters , one is then able to construct the trilinear magnetoelectric coupling term in the free energy which provides a phenomenological explanation of the combined magnetic and ferroelectric phase transition .",
    "this paper is organized in conformity with the above plan . in sec .",
    "ii we review a simplified version of the symmetry analysis known as _ representation theory _ , in which we directly analyze the symmetry of the inverse susceptibility matrix .",
    "here we also review the technique we proposed some time ago@xcite to incorporate the consequences of inversion symmetry . in sec .",
    "iii we apply this formalism to develop magnetic order parameters for a number of multiferroic systems and in eq .",
    "( [ ireq ] ) we give a simple example to show how inversion symmetry influences the symmetry of the allowed spin distribution .",
    "then in sec .",
    "iv , we use the symmetry of the order parameters to construct a magnetoelectric coupling free energy , whose symmetry properties are manifested . in sec . v we summarize the results of these calculations and discuss their relation to calculations based on the spin current model@xcite or the phenomenology of continuum theory.@xcite",
    "as we shall see , to understand the phenomenology of the magnetoelectric coupling which gives rise to the combined magnetic and ferroelectric phase transition , it is essential to characterize and properly understand the symmetry of the magnetic ordering .",
    "in addition , as we shall see , to fully include symmetry restrictions on possible magnetic structures that can be accessed via a continuous phase transition is an extremely powerful aid in the magnetic structure analysis , accordingly in this section we review how symmetry considerations restrict the possible magnetic structures which can appear at an ordering transition .",
    "the full symmetry analysis has previously been presented elsewhere,@xcite , but it is useful to repeat it here both to fix the notation and to give the reader convenient access to this analysis which is so essential to the present discussion . to avoid the complexities of the most general form of this analysis ( called representation theory),@xcite we will limit discussion to systems having some crucial simplifying features .",
    "first , we limit consideration to systems in which the magnetic ordering is incommensurate . in the examples we choose @xmath5 will usually lie along a symmetry direction of the crystal .",
    "second , we only consider systems which have a center of inversion symmetry , because it is only such systems that have a sharp phase transition at which long - range ferroelectric order appears .",
    "thirdly , we restrict attention to crystals having relatively simple symmetry .",
    "( what this means is that except for our discussion of tbmn@xmath1o@xmath4 we will consider systems where we do not need the full apparatus of group theory , but can get away with simply labeling the spin functions which describe magnetic order by their eigenvalue under various symmetry operations . ) by avoiding the complexities of the most general situations , it is hoped that this paper will be accessible to more readers . finally , as we will see , it is crucial that the phase transitions we analyze are either continuous or very nearly so . in many of the examples we discuss ,",
    "our simple approach@xcite is vastly simpler than that of standard representation theory augmented by representation theory specialized techniques to explicitly include exploit inversion symmetry .      in this subsection",
    "we give a review of the formalism used previously@xcite and presented in detail in refs . .",
    "since we are mainly interested in symmetry properties , we will describe the magnetic ordering by a version of mean - field theory in which one writes the magnetic free energy @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the thermally averaged @xmath9-component of the spin at position @xmath10 . in a moment",
    ", we will give an explicit approximation for the inverse susceptibility @xmath11 .",
    "we now introduce fourier transforms in either of two equivalent formulations . in the first ( which we refer to as  actual position \" )",
    "one writes @xmath12 whereas in the second ( which we refer to as  unit cell \" ) one writes @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the number of unit cells in the system , @xmath15 is the location of the @xmath16th site within the unit cell , and @xmath17 is a lattice vector .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ actual ] ) the phase factor in the fourier transform is defined in terms of the actual position of the spin rather than in terms of the origin of the unit cell , as is done in eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) . in some case",
    "nvo ) the results are simpler in the actual position formulation whereas for others ( viz .",
    "mwo ) the unit cell formulation is simpler .",
    "we will use whichever formulation is simpler . in either case",
    "the fact that @xmath18 has to be real indicates that @xmath19 we thus have @xmath20 where ( for the  actual position \" formulation ) @xmath21    to make our discussion more concrete we cite the simplest approximation for a system with general anisotropic exchange coupling , so that the hamiltonian is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath9-component of the spin operator at @xmath10 and we have included a single ion anisotropy energy assuming three inequivalent axes , so that the @xmath24 are all different .",
    "one has that @xmath25 \\delta_{\\alpha , \\beta } \\delta_{{\\bf r},{\\bf r } ' } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is unity if @xmath27 and is zero otherwise and @xmath28 is a spin - dependent constant of order unity , so that @xmath29 is the entropy associated with a spin @xmath30 .",
    "then if we have one spin per unit cell , one has @xmath31 + akt + k_\\alpha \\biggr ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the lattice constant in the @xmath9-direction@xcite and we assume that @xmath33 .",
    "graphs of @xmath34 are shown in fig . 1 for both the ferromagnetic ( @xmath35 ) and antiferromagnetic ( @xmath36 ) cases .",
    "for the ferromagnetic case we now introduce a competing antiferromagnetic next - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interaction @xmath37 along the @xmath38-axis , so that @xmath39 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and this is also shown in fig .",
    "1 . as @xmath40 is lowered one reaches a critical temperature where one of the eigenvalues of the inverse susceptibility matrix becomes zero .",
    "this indicates that the paramagnetic phase is unstable with respect to order corresponding to the critical eigenvector associated with the zero eigenvalue . for the ferromagnet this happens for zero wavevector and for the antiferromagnet for a zone boundary wavevector in agreement with our obvious expectation . for competing interactions we see that the values of the @xmath41 s determine a wavevector at which an eigenvalue of @xmath42 is minimal .",
    "this is the phenomenon called  wavevector selection , \" and in this case the selected value of @xmath43 is determined by extremizing @xmath42 to be@xcite @xmath44 providing @xmath45 .",
    "( otherwise the system is ferromagnetic . )",
    "note also , that crystal symmetry may select a set of symmetry - related wavevectors , which comprise what is known as the _ star _ of @xmath43 .",
    "( for instance , if the system were tetragonal , then crystal symmetry would imply that one has the same nnn interactions along the @xmath46-axis , in which case the system selects a wavevector along the @xmath38-axis and one of equal magnitude along the @xmath46-axis .       from the above discussion",
    "it should be clear that if we assume a continuous transition so that the transition is associated with the instability in the terms in the free energy quadratic in the spin amplitudes , then the nature of the ordered phase is determined by the critical eigenvector of the inverse susceptibility , i. e. the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue of inverse susceptibility which first goes to zero as the temperature is reduced .",
    "accordingly , the aim of this paper analyze how crystal symmetry affects the possible forms of the critical eigenvector .",
    "when the unit cell contains @xmath47 spins , the inverse susceptibility for each wavevector @xmath43 is a @xmath48 matrix .",
    "the ordering transition occurs when , for some selected wavevector(s ) , an eigenvalue first becomes zero as the temperature is reduced . in the above simple examples involving isotropic exchange interactions , the inverse susceptibility was @xmath49 diagonal matrix , so that each eigenvector trivially has only one nonzero component .",
    "the critical eigenvector has spin oriented along the easiest axis , i. e. the one for which @xmath24 is minimal . in the present more general case @xmath47 and arbitrary interactions",
    "consistent with crystal symmetry are allowed . to avoid the technicalities of group theory , we use as our guiding principle the fact that the free energy , being an expansion in powers of the magnetizations relative to the the paramagnetic state , must be invariant under all the symmetry operations of the crystal.@xcite",
    "this is the same principle that one uses in discussing the symmetry of the electrostatic potential in a crystal .",
    "@xcite we now focus our attention on the critically selected wavevector @xmath50 which has an eigenvalue which first becomes zero as the temperature is lowered .",
    "this value of @xmath43 is determined by the interactions and we will consider it to be an experimentally determined parameter .",
    "operations which leave the quadratic free energy invariant must leave invariant the term in the free energy @xmath51 which involves only the selected wavevector @xmath43 , namely @xmath52 any symmetry operation takes the original variables before transformation , @xmath53 , into new ones indicated by primes .",
    "we write this transformation as @xmath54 according to a well known statement of elementary quantum mechanics , if an operator @xmath40 commutes with @xmath34 , then the eigenvectors of @xmath34 are simultaneously eigenvectors of @xmath40 .",
    "( this much involves a well known analysis.@xcite we will later consider the effect of inversion , the analysis of which is universally overlooked ) .",
    "we will apply this simple condition to a number of multiferroic systems currently under investigation .",
    "( this approach can be much more straightforward than the standard one when the operations which conserve wavevector unavoidably involve translations . ) as a first example we consider the case of nvo and use the  actual position \" fourier transforms . in table",
    "[ nvostr ] we give the general positions ( this set of positions is the so - called wyckoff orbit ) for the space group cmca ( # 64 in ref . ) of nvo and this table defines the operations of the space group of cmca . in table",
    "[ nvomag ] we list the positions of the two types of sites occupied by the magnetic ( ni ) ions , which are called  spine \" and  cross - tie \" sites in recognition of their distinctive coordination in the lattice , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ nvostrfig ] , where we show the conventional unit cell of nvo .",
    "experiments@xcite indicate that as the temperature is lowered , the system first develops incommensurate order with @xmath43 along the @xmath55-direction with @xmath56.@xcite      .[nvomag ] positions@xcite of @xmath64 carrying @xmath30=@xmath65 within the primitive unit cell illustrated in fig . .",
    "here @xmath66 denotes the position of the @xmath67th spine site and @xmath68 that of the @xmath67th cross - tie site .",
    "nvo orders in space group @xmath69 , so there are six more atoms in the conventional orthorhombic unit cell which are obtained by a translation through @xmath70 . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     the mn@xmath71 wyckoff orbits contain two atoms and all the other orbits contain four atoms . in either case",
    "we may consider separately an orbit and a single component , @xmath38 , @xmath46 , or @xmath72 of spin .",
    "so the corresponding spin functions form a basis set of @xmath67 vectors , where @xmath73 for the single spin components of mn@xmath71 and @xmath74 , otherwise . in each case",
    ", the operations involving @xmath75 and/or @xmath76 interchange sites and therefore have zero diagonal elements .",
    "their character , which is their trace within this space of @xmath67 vectors is therefore zero . on the other hand @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "give diagonal elements of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "so their character ( or trace ) is @xmath81 and we have the last line of the table for this reducible representation @xmath82 .    in this character table",
    "we also list ( in the last line ) the characters of these operations within the vector space of wavefunctions of a given spin component over a wyckoff orbit of @xmath67 sites . comparing this last line of the table to the character of the irreps",
    "we see that @xmath83 contains only the irrep @xmath84 and it contains this irrep @xmath85 times .",
    "this means that for the system of three spin components over 12 sites , we have 36 complex components and these function generate a reducible representation which contains @xmath84 18 times .",
    "if there were no other symmetries to consider , this result would imply that to determine the structure one would have to fix the 18 complex - valued parameters .",
