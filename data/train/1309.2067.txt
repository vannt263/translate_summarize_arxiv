    "the challenges of the lhc are to discover of the higgs boson and to search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the discovery of the higgs boson was reported by the atlas  @xcite and the cms collaborations  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile no signals of new physics have been observed so far from the lhc .",
    "however the nature indicates the existence of physics beyond the sm that accounts for the shortcomings in the sm , e.g. , no candidate of dark matter , the origin of neutrino mass , the baryon asymmetry of the universe , and so on .    it is a challenge to confirm the new physics from only experimental / observational data .",
    "theoretical studies in advance are essential to identify the signatures of new physics .",
    "we now have measurement data of the higgs boson , the relic abundance of the dark matter , and so on .",
    "what we should do , therefore , is to precisely extract probable parameter space , and predict the signatures in each scenario of new physics by using the measurement data .",
    "one of the leading candidates of the new physics is supersymmetric ( susy ) extension .",
    "a scenario in the extension is the constrained minimal supersymmetric sm ( cmssm ) which is simple but phenomenologically successful framework  @xcite . in the cmssm ,",
    "all of the observables are described by only five parameters , and these parameters are tightly connected with the property of the higgs boson .",
    "the reported mass of the higgs boson , @xmath1gev , suggests heavy susy particles  @xcite .",
    "this suggestion is consistent with a null signal of exotics at the lhc .",
    "the heavy susy particles imply the heavy dark matter in this framework , because the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) works as the dark matter .",
    "cosmological and astrophysical measurements confirmed the existence of dark matter , and numerical simulations suggest that weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are the most feasible candidate for the dark matter  @xcite . in the cmssm with r - parity conservation , the bino - like neutralino is the lsp and consequently is a wimp dark matter candidate .",
    "the measured abundance of the neutralino dark matter can be acquired in the coannihilation region .",
    "the heavy neutralino dark matter requires large coannihilation rate .",
    "the large coannihilation rate sufficiently reduces the relic number density of the neutralino , and can reproduce the measured abundance of dark matter . the large coannihilation rate needs the tight degeneracy in mass between the neutralino lsp and the stau nlsp ( nlsp : next to the lightest susy particle )  @xcite . indeed in large part of parameter space wherein",
    "the mass of the higgs boson is consistent with the reported one , the mass difference between the neutralino lsp and the stau nlsp is smaller than the mass of tau lepton , @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "such a tight degeneracy makes the stau nlsp to be long - lived charged massive particle ( champ )  @xcite .",
    "the long - lived champs can modify the chain of nuclear reactions in a stage of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and hence distort the primordial abundances of light elements .",
    "the success and failure of the nucleosynthesis are quite sensitive to the property of the long - lived champs , e.g. , the lifetime , the number density , the electric charge , and so on  @xcite .",
    "the success of the nucleosynthesis means to reproduce the measured abundances of light elements .",
    "notice that measured abundance of the lithium-7 ( @xmath3li ) is reported to be inconsistent with the theoretical prediction in the standard bbn ; the measured one is @xmath4",
    "@xcite and the theoretical prediction is @xmath5  @xcite . this inconsistency is known as the lithium-7 problem  @xcite , and the success of the nucleosynthesis includes also solving the problem .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the success of the nucleosynthesis constrains and predicts the property of the stau nlsp .",
    "the purpose of this work is to give theoretical clues to experimentally identify the cmssm as the new physics in the light of the natures of the higgs boson , the measured abundance of dark matter , and the success of the nucleosynthesis .",
    "we concentrate on the scenario wherein the mass difference of the neutralino lsp and the stau nlsp is smaller than the mass of tau lepton , and the longevity of the stau is guaranteed by the tight phase space .",
    "both the mass and the signal strength of the higgs boson are correlated with parameters of the stop sector .",
    "so it sheds light on the sign(@xmath6 ) , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the predictability of the derived relations , however , is not so strong because of too large degrees of freedom of their parameter space . besides the property of the long - lived stau",
    "is predicted / constrained from the nucleosynthesis , and is projected mainly on the values of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noted that , combining the relations from the natures of the higgs boson and the values of sfermion parameters from the bbn , as we will find , the linear relation between @xmath7 and @xmath8 are derived .",
    "furthermore the degeneracy of the neutralino lsp and the stau nlsp in the coannihilation region set a relation between @xmath10 and sfermion parameters . thus accumulating all of relations and constraints , we give theoretical clues on the parameter space of the cmssm .",
    "then we calculate the observables of terrestrial experiments based on the analysis . after the discovery of susy signals , by checking those with the calculation we make it possible to confirm the cmssm in the near future .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    "we recall the framework of the cmssm , keeping an eye on the coannihilation scenario .",
    "then we set the constraint on some input parameters from the viewpoint of the report of the higgs boson and the observed abundances of both dark matter and light elements . in sec .",
    "[ sec : prediction ] , we show the predictions for susy mass spectrum , the anomalous magnetic moment of muon , branching fractions of the @xmath0-meson rare decays , and direct detection of the neutralino dark matter in the allowed region .",
    "we show the number of the signals of the long - lived stau and the neutralino at the lhc experiment , and then we discuss the verification of the scenario in sec  [ sec : lhcexp ] .",
    "[ sec : sum ] is devoted to a summary and a discussion .",
    "here we show our constraints to derive the experimentally favored parameter space in the cmssm .    before we explain the detail of our constraints , we briefly review the cmssm .",
    "the cmssm is described by four parameters and a sign , @xmath11 where the first three parameters are the universal scalar mass , the universal gaugino mass , and the universal trilinear coupling at the scale of grand unification , respectively . here",
    "@xmath12 is the ratio of vacuum expectation values of two higgs bosons , and @xmath6 is the supersymmetric higgsino mass parameter . in the cmssm , we describe all observables by these parameters , and hence we can derive the favored parameter space by putting the experimental / observational constraints on the calculated observables .    from now on , we explain in more details our constraints and how to apply those to our numerical calculations .",
    "the first requirement comes from the higgs boson mass .",
    "the latest reports on its mass , @xmath13 , are @xmath14 by the cms collaboration  @xcite , and @xmath15 by the atlas collaboration  @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is known that the higgs boson mass calculated by each public codes fluctuates by about @xmath16gev  @xcite .",
    "taking into account these uncertainties , we apply a more conservative constraint as @xmath17    the second constraint comes from the observation for the relic abundance of the dark matter .",
    "the wmap satellite reported the value at the 3 sigma level  @xcite , @xmath18 in most of the cmssm parameter space , the relic abundance of the neutralino lsp is over - abundant against the measured value .",
    "the correct dark matter abundance requires the unique parameter space where the bino - like neutralino lsp and the stau nlsp are degenerate in mass so that the coannihilation mechanism works well  @xcite .",
    "the third and fourth constraints are required from solving the lithium-7 problem .",
    "the stau nlsp is long - lived if the mass difference is smaller than the mass of tau lepton  @xcite . in the case",
    "that the stau survives until the bbn epoch , the lithium-7 density can be reduced to the measured value with the exotic nuclear reactions induced by the stau . as the third condition",
    ", we impose the mass difference , @xmath19 , to be @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the masses of the stau nlsp and the neutralino lsp , respectively . with this mass difference , the stau nlsp is sufficiently long - lived so that it can survive until the bbn era  @xcite . in our numerical calculation",
    ", we use the pole mass of top quark as an input which involves an uncertainty of @xmath23gev .",
    "it is expected that the susy spectrum also includes the same order of uncertainties .",
    "so in the numerical results in the next section , we show also the case of @xmath24 to make more conservative prediction on the cmssm parameters .",
    "the forth constraint is the upper bound on the mass of the neutralino lsp , @xmath25 this upper bound is derived from the requirement of the abundances of both the dark matter and light elements .",
    "the yield value of the negatively charged stau at the bbn epoch is required to be larger than @xmath26 , where @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the entropy density ) , to sufficiently reduce the lithium-7  @xcite .",
    "assuming the enough longevity of the stau , @xmath29 is fixed at when the ratio of number densities of the stau nlsp and the neutralino lsp are frozen out .",
    "the yield value @xmath29 is expressed with the relic density of the neutralino dark matter @xmath30 @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the freeze - out temperature of the ratio , @xmath33 . the relic abundance of the dark matter is bounded ( see eq .  ( [ eq : dmabundance ] ) ) , @xmath34 here @xmath35 is the today s entropy density , @xmath36 is the scale factor of the hubble expansion rate , and @xmath37 is the critical density . combining these facts , we obtain the upper bound on the mass of the neutralino dark matter , @xmath38 hence the upper bound on the neutralino mass is @xmath39gev .",
    "in this section , we show the allowed region in the cmssm parameter space by imposing the constraints explained in sec .  [",
    "sec : parameter region ] .",
    "we calculate the susy spectrum , the dm abundance and other observables using micromegas  @xcite implementing spheno  @xcite , and the lightest higgs mass using feynhiggs  @xcite .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : a0-m0plane ] , we show the allowed region in @xmath41-@xmath40 plane for @xmath42 and @xmath43 from top to bottom and @xmath44 and @xmath45gev from left to right panels , respectively .",
    "color represents @xmath46 .",
    "notably , one can see that @xmath40 and @xmath41 have an almost linear relation for fixed @xmath46 .",
    "the relations can be parameterized as @xmath47 these linear relations come from the tight degeneracy in mass between the stau and the neutralino .",
    "we explain the linear relation as follows .",
    "firstly we note that signs of @xmath6 and @xmath40 is opposite each other due to obtaining the large higgs boson mass as we explain latter . in this scenario",
    "we choose @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . for a fixed @xmath50 , in response to an increasing of @xmath7 , the mass of the lighter stau is also increased . in order to keep the mass difference to be smaller than 1gev(0.1gev ) , @xmath51 also has to be increased .",
    "increasing of @xmath51 makes a non - diagonal element of the stau mass matrix to be large , and hence the mass eigenvalue of the lighter stau is decreased after diagonarization to be within the small mass difference . as a result , the linear behavior in the @xmath8-@xmath7 plane is found .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig : a0-m0plane ] that @xmath52 in the allowed region increases as @xmath12 increases .",
    "this is because the soft masses of the staus are more decreased for larger @xmath9 in rg running due to the tau yukawa couplings .",
    "the terms with tau yukawa coupling in rge decrease the soft masses in the running  @xcite .",
    "these become significant when @xmath9 is large because the tau yukawa coupling is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "thus larger @xmath7 is required for larger @xmath9 to obtain the stau mass satisfying with eq . or .",
    "the upper and the lower edges of the allowed region in all panels of the fig .",
    "[ fig : a0-m0plane ] are determined by the constraints of the correct abundances both of the dark matter and the light elements .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "since the dark matter abundance is depend on the neutralino lsp mass as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmabundance ] ) , the dark matter abundance gives the lower bound on the neutralino mass .",
    "on the other hand , the light elements abundance gives the upper bound as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : neutralinomass ] ) .",
    "the bounds for the lighter stau mass is nearly same as that for the neutralino mass due to the tight degeneracy .",
    "therefore once @xmath40 is fixed , @xmath41 can vary in range satisfying the bound for the lighter stau mass .",
    "thus , the upper and the lower edges are determined by the constraints .",
    "on the other hand , the right side of the allowed region is determined by the lower bound on the higgs boson mass .",
    "we can see from the the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : a0-m0plane_mh_xt ] that the higgs boson mass reaches to @xmath54gev .",

    "the tree - level contribution is simply given by the @xmath56 boson mass @xmath57 while the radiative corrections are given by the masses of the top @xmath58 , the lighter / heavier stop @xmath59 , the stop mixing parameter @xmath60 , and the vacuum expectation values of the higgs bosons , @xmath61 , here @xmath62 and @xmath63 are vacuum expectation values of up - type and down - type higgs boson , respectively .",

    "the first condition that guarantees enough long lifetime of the stau constrains the stau mass for a fixed neutralino mass , hence the scalar soft mass @xmath7 and the trilinear coupling @xmath8 , while the second one that guarantees the sufficient reduction of the lithium-7 constrains the upper bound on the neutralino mass or the gaugino soft mass @xmath10 .",
    "we analyzed the parameter space as well as the susy spectrum of the cmssm by taking the recent results on the higgs mass , susy searches and the dark matter abundance into account .    in sec .",
    "iii , we have shown the allowed region on the @xmath8-@xmath7 and @xmath7-@xmath10 plane for @xmath130 and @xmath73gev varying @xmath151 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "we found a linear relation between @xmath8 and @xmath7 in all cases as given in eq .. the relation originates from the tightly degenerate mass of the stau and the relic abundance of the neutralino .",
    "it was also found that the allowed region on @xmath8-@xmath7 plane shifts to higher scale as @xmath12 increases .",
    "thus the susy spectrum is heavier for large @xmath12 . on the other hand , as seen in fig.[fig : tb20_cut_m0m12mh_dm1 ] , @xmath10 is constrained between @xmath152 and @xmath153gev for @xmath154 .",
    "the upper bound comes from the yield value of the stau while the lower one from the small mass difference and the dark matter abundance .",
    "thus , the conditions required to solve the lithium-7 problem play an important role to determine the allowed region of the cmssm parameters .",
    "notably , these results naturally lead to heavy susy spectrum .",
    "the bounds on @xmath10 lead to the stau mass between @xmath155 and @xmath156gev .",

    ": msquarksmgluino]-[fig : mheavyhiggs ] , we have shown the susy spectrum and the heavier higgs mass in the allowed region .",
    "one can see that the whole spectrum is relatively heavy so that it is consistent with the null results of the susy searches at the lhc experiment . among the spectrum , one of the important predictions",
    "is the masses of the gluino and the @xmath73st/@xmath157nd generation squarks . in fig.[fig : msquarksmgluino ] , it was shown that the the masses are clearly correlated with the neutralino mass .",
    "this is the direct consequences from the linear relation of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus in our scenario , once one of them is determined , the others can be predicted .",
    "it is important to emphasize here that the masses of gluino and squarks are constrained between @xmath158 and @xmath159tev for @xmath160 .",
    "these gluino and squark masses are out of reach at @xmath161 tev lhc run but really in reach of @xmath162tev lhc run .",
    "the expected numbers of the long - lived staus ( nearly degenerate neutralino ) to @xmath163fb@xmath164 are about @xmath165 for the light neutralino mass and @xmath166 for the heavy one , respectively . with these numbers ,",
    "the long - lived stau and the nearly degenerate neutralino will be identified easily .",
    "thus our scenario explains why susy has not been found yet , and at the same time predicts the early discovery of susy in the coming few years .",
    "the other important prediction is the stop mass .",
    "the stops are also relatively heavy in our scenario .",
    "such stop masses gives large radiative corrections to the higgs mass , and in fact the higgs mass is pushed up to @xmath167gev in sizable regions of the parameter space .",
    "the production cross section of such a lighter stop pair is comparable to those of the gluino and the squarks , and the expected number of the stops to @xmath163fb@xmath164 are between @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "thus we can expect that the lighter stops also will be found at the @xmath162tev run of lhc .",
    "the susy spectrum is consistent with the present results on muon anomalous magnetic moment within @xmath170 and @xmath171 and @xmath172 within @xmath173 .",
    "the direct detection cross section of the neutralino is from @xmath174 to @xmath175@xmath176 and is in reach of xenon @xmath73ton and lux / zep @xmath138ton .    in conclusion ,",
    "our scenario is predictive and indeed testable in the coming @xmath162tev lhc run .",
