    "exactly solvable models have played an important role in the history of condensed matter physics .",
    "a famous example is the luttinger model @xcite solved in an important paper by mattis and lieb @xcite .",
    "the key to this solution is a collection of mathematical results commonly known as _ bosonization _ ( another common name is _ boson - fermion correspondence _ ) . in the case of the luttinger model",
    ", bosonization is particularly powerful : not only all energy eigenstates and eigenvalues but any quantity of physical interest can be computed exactly by analytical means ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "moreover , as shown in @xcite , a non - trivial limit of this solution of the luttinger model is equivalent to johnson s solution @xcite of the massless thirring model @xcite .",
    "bosonization is today a standard tool in condensed matter physics , and it has allowed physicists to obtain interesting results even in situations where exact solutions are not available . however , it is not always easy to judge the mathematical status of such results in the physics literature .",
    "one difficulty is that bosonization has a complicated history , and papers developing its mathematical foundations were written with a focus on other applications , notably the representation theory of infinite dimensional lie algebras and string theory ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "there exist excellent reviews and textbooks on bosonization in the condensed matter physics literature , including @xcite , which provide the reader with practical knowledge on how bosonization is used in applications .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the existing literature lacks a self - contained account of all mathematical details needed to promote formal bosonization results in condensed matter physics to rigorous mathematical statements .",
    "one aim of the present paper is to fill this gap , and for this we combine different approaches found in the mathematics literature @xcite .",
    "we discuss a model of interacting fermions coupled to acoustic phonons which can be solved exactly by bosonization .",
    "our program is to develop all mathematical tools which are needed to give this result , known in the condensed matter physics literature for a long time @xcite , a rigorous mathematical foundation . in particular , we include a self - contained account of bosonization , where we try to remain close to how bosonization is used in condensed matter physics , but , at the same time , also address the relevant functional analytic issues .",

    "as will be shown , if the coupling constants are in the range    @xmath13    then this model can be constructed and solved by bosonization .",
    "( if these conditions are not fulfilled , the model describes an unstable system . )",
    "we note that , in our approach to the fermion - phonon model , we follow previous work on the construction and exact solution of a two - dimensional interacting fermion model by bosonization in @xcite ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "however , these papers only stated the mathematical results underlying bosonization , and thus one motivation for the present paper is to provide self - contained proofs of these results .",
    "the fermion - phonon model in  is interesting since it has zero - temperature phase transitions to charge - density - wave and superconducting states , and its phase diagram can be determined from certain fermion four - point correlation functions @xcite . from a mathematical point of view , this model is an extension of the massless thirring model , which ( essentially ) corresponds to the limiting case @xmath14 .",
    "however , as opposed to this limiting case , the fermion - phonon model is _ not _ relativistically invariant , which is obvious since its correlation functions depend on two different velocities @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; see below .",
    "nevertheless , as will be discussed , this model shares many properties with relativistically invariant quantum field theory models .",
    "since many effective low - energy models in condensed matter physics happen to be relativistically invariant , this is an interesting counterexample .    as a further motivation of the bosonization techniques presented in this paper",
    ", we mention recent mathematical work on bosonization based on functional integral techniques ; see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "these methods allow for treating even models which need not be exactly solvable , but they have been restricted , up to now , to models with fermions only .",
    "it would be interesting to extend these results to models where fermions are coupled to bosons .",
    "we hope that the results in the present paper can serve as a useful guide in this direction .",
    "as will be shown , the fermion - phonon model can be made mathematically precise by introducing cutoffs @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which have the physical interpretation as system size and interaction range , respectively .",
    "the regularized model thus obtained is an exactly solvable extension of the luttinger model . to obtain the correlation functions for the model in ",
    ", one has to pass to both the _ continuum limit _ @xmath19 and the _ thermodynamic limit _ @xmath20 ; this is a generalization of the limit in @xcite where the thirring model is constructed from the luttinger model .",
    "as will be shown , the continuum limit is non - trivial in that it requires additive and multiplicative renormalizations .",
    "however , passing to these limits simplifies the correlation functions significantly , and physical arguments suggest that the result is universal in the following sense : the physical properties of the fermion - phonon model at intermediate distances do not depend on the regularization , i.e.  on short - distance details .",
    "for example , after multiplicative renormalization , the fermion two - point correlation functions we obtain in these limits are @xmath21 with parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 determined by the model parameters ( see proposition  [ proposition : diagonalization_of_fermion - phonon_model ] ) ; @xmath28 is an arbitrary length parameter introduced by the multiplicative renormalization .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the collection of mathematical results known as bosonization are presented and proved in sections  [ sec : mathematics_of_bosonization_i ]  and  [ sec : mathematics_of_bosonization_ii ] . for this",

    "regardless of this choice , the same collection of results is obtained in the end . in our opinion",
    ", the second approach is simpler from a mathematical point of view .",
    "the first approach is , however , more natural from the point of view of condensed matter physics , and this is why we follow it in this paper ; see e.g.  @xcite for the second approach .",
    "the present section is concerned with the construction of the bosons from the fermions ; the reconstruction of the fermions from the bosons is addressed in section  [ sec : mathematics_of_bosonization_ii ] .",
    "we remind the reader that some notational conventions used throughout this paper are explained in appendix  [ appendix : notation ] .",
    "our first aim is to construct a hilbert space @xmath31 , the so - called _ fermion fock space _ , giving a precise mathematical meaning to the quantum field theory model defined by the hamiltonian in appendix  [ appendix : bosonization_nutshell ] . ]",
    "@xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with fermion field operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 characterized by the car @xmath37 the physical requirement underlying this construction is that @xmath38 must have a ground state .",
    "this is ensured by requiring that there is a distinguished element @xmath39 in @xmath31 , the so - called _ vacuum _ , which satisfies @xmath40 and is normalized , i.e.  @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the inner product in @xmath31 .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath31 is fully determined by these conditions , and it is such that @xmath38 defines a self - adjoint operator on @xmath31 bounded from below .",
    "we now recall how this can be substantiated .    to construct @xmath31",
    "we use fermion creation operators @xmath43 satisfying the conditions : @xmath44 with @xmath45 and a normalized state @xmath46 . assuming that @xmath47 are operators on @xmath31",
    ", one can construct other states in @xmath31 as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 are non - negative integers . using the relations in , it is straightforward to prove by induction over @xmath50 and @xmath51 that these states are orthonormal .",
    "let @xmath52 denote the vector space of all finite linear combinations of the states in .",
    "this set forms a pre - hilbert space , and @xmath31 is obtained from @xmath52 by norm - completion ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we find it convenient to introduce the following notation for the states in : @xmath53 where only finitely many of the quantum numbers @xmath54 are non - zero and @xmath55 denotes the infinite vector @xmath56 .",
    "the arrow over the product symbol indicates that the fermion operators are ordered as in .",
    "the above definitions allow us to write formulas in a compact way .",
    "for instance , orthonormality and completeness of the states in can be expressed as @xmath57 note that the states @xmath58 are common eigenstates of @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 ( this follows from the car in and the definition in ) .     it is not difficult to construct a bijection between the set of quantum numbers @xmath55 and @xmath61 to prove that the hilbert space @xmath31 thus constructed is separable .",
    "9999    we are now ready to give a precise meaning to the model defined in .",
    "the method we employ is _ construction by exact solution _ in the sense that self - adjointness of the hamiltonian is shown by constructing all its eigenstates and eigenvalues .",
    "using the relations in it is easy to check that the operators @xmath62 satisfy the relations in . moreover , for the operators we consider , normal ordering can be made precise as follows : @xmath63 this implies @xmath64 which allows us to cast the hamiltonian in in a manifestly positive - definite form : @xmath65     [ remark : boundedness ] the car in and the eigenvalue equation imply that the fermion operators @xmath66 are bounded on @xmath31 with operator norm equal to unity , and thus @xmath67 is the hilbert space adjoint of @xmath68 .",
    "it follows that @xmath69 are also bounded operators .",
    "this implies that the algebra generated by the fermion field algebra is a @xmath70-algebra , which is the starting point of an elegant mathematical approach to fermion quantum field theories ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , to remain self - contained , we follow a more pedestrian approach avoiding @xmath70-algebra techniques .     9999    from the equations above one can deduce several important properties of @xmath38 , which we summarize as follows .     * * [ lemma : h0 ] the hamiltonian @xmath38 in defines a self - adjoint operator on @xmath31 , and it satisfies the following commutation relation on @xmath52 : @xmath71      = rk \\hat{\\psi}^{\\dagger}_{r}(k).\\ ] ] moreover , all states in are eigenstates of @xmath38 with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath72    in particular , @xmath39 is the ground state of @xmath38 with ground state energy zero : @xmath73 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation @xmath74 follows from and .",
    "this implies that @xmath38 is a self - adjoint operator ( this is a consequence of a simple general result stated in lemma  [ lemma : self_adjointness ] ) .",
    "we note that the commutation relation in is easily motivated by formal computations using the definition of @xmath38 in and the car in if we ignore normal ordering . to make these computations precise we introduce a cutoff @xmath75 and study the regularized hamiltonian @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a positive constant which diverges with increasing @xmath78 .",
    "the second equality is obtained using @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the heaviside function ( this is a simple consequence of the definitions ) .    since the regularized hamiltonian @xmath81 is a _",
    "finite _ sum of bounded operators , it is bounded , and thus commutation relations , etc . , can be safely derived by formal computations using the car in . in particular , it is obvious that @xmath82 on @xmath52 ( in a sense made precise in definition  [ definition : operator_convergence ] ) .",

    "it follows that the result obtained by formal computations is correct if interpreted as an identity on the domain @xmath52 ( this follows from a simple general result stated in lemma  [ lemma : commutators ] ) .",
