    "high - energy emission in pulsars comes from high altitudes .",
    "recent work shows that most optical , x - ray and @xmath1-ray emission comes from caustic zones at mid - to - high altitudes in the star s magnetosphere or wind .",

    "they may also coincide with current sheets either within or outside of the light cylinder .",
    "the highly nonlinear behavior of relativistic photon caustics , combined with uncertainties in the magnetic field structure close to the light cylinder , means that any of these possible emission zones can reproduce observed high - energy light curves .",
    "because we do not know whether pulsed high - energy emission is due to synchrotron radiation , curvature radiation or inverse compton scattering , we have few constraints on physical conditions within the high - energy emission zones .",
    "we need more information , and believe radio observations can help .",
    "radio emission in a large number of pulsars comes from lower altitudes , close to the magnetic axis .",
    "this geometry works for many pulsars , but fails for an interesting minority . for those stars  including the pulsar in the crab nebula , the subject of this paper  the similarity of the radio and high - energy light curves strongly suggests the radio emission comes from the same high - altitude regions that create the high - energy emission .",
    "however , the geometrical models do not address the physical mechanisms by which the magnetospheric plasma produces the intense radio emission we observe .",
    "many different emission mechanisms have been proposed , but none has been proven to be operating in the general pulsar population .",
    "our group has approached the question of pulsar radio emission mechanisms by carrying out detailed studies of one object , the crab pulsar .",
    "this pulsar shines in radio at many phases throughout its rotation period , with seven components detectable in its mean profile .",
    "at least three , and probably five , of these come from high altitude emission zones , spatially coincident with the high - energy emission zones in this star s magnetosphere .",
    "the high time resolution and broad spectral bandwidth of our observations show that different components have different temporal and spectral characteristics .",
    "we infer that more than one type of radio emission mechanism is taking place within the star s magnetosphere .",

    "the spacing between adjacent bands is not constant , as one might expect for simple harmonic emission .",
    "instead , the band spacing increases with frequency , while _ keeping the fractional separation constant_. our data between 6 and 30 ghz are well fit by @xmath13 ( details in hankins & eilek 2007 , hankins 2016 ) .",
    "interestingly , our formal fit to the band spacing is consistent with zero band spacing at zero frequency , even though we have seen no high - frequency interpulses below 5 ghz .",
    "we have never seen a high - frequency interpulse which did not have emission bands across our full observing band .",
    "thus , although we have never been able to observe the full 5 - 30 ghz bandwidth at one time , we think it likely that each burst of a high - frequency interpulse contains at least 30 emission bands , proportionally spaced from 5 ghz upwards .",
    "the high - frequency interpulse of the crab pulsar is the only place where ordered spectral emission bands have been seen in a pulsar .",
    "the bands can not be satisfactorily explained by any current model of pulsar radio emission ( including those listed in appendix [ app : radioemissionmodels ] ) .    to search for new models ,",
    "we note the resemblance between emission bands in the high - frequency interpulse and `` zebra bands '' seen in dynamic spectra of type iv solar flares .",
    "zebra band sets can have from a few up to @xmath14 spectral bands ; they also have band spacing that increases with frequency ( e.g. chernov 2005 ) .",
    "two classes of models have been proposed for zebra bands : geometric effects and resonant plasma emission .",
    "perhaps of these models will help us understand the emission bands in the crab pulsar .",
    "the striking regularity of the bands suggests an interference or propagation effect .",
    "for instance , if some mechanism splits the emission beam coherently , it may interfere with itself , creating emission bands .",
    "alternatively , perhaps cavities form in the plasma and trap some of the incoming radiation , imposing a discrete frequency structure on the escaping signal .",
    "both possibilities have been suggested for solar zebra bands ( e.g. ledenev 2001 ; labelle 2003 ) .",
    "the necessary plasma structures must be small , on the order of a few to a few hundred centimeters .",
    "while we find this idea attractive , making it work is challenging .",
    "one issue is the incoming radiation .",
    "if the bands are due to a geometrical effect , the incoming radiation must be coherent over the full 5 - 30 ghz band .",
    "the narrow - band shots which characterize main pulse and low - frequency interpulse emission do not work .",
    "a quite different emission mechanism is needed  perhaps from a double layer .",
    "charges accelerated in the potential drop of a double layer emit broadband radiation ( kuijpers 1990 ) . if the double layer thickness is @xmath15 ( following carlqvist 1982 for a relativistic lepton double layer ) , the radiation bandwidth may be sufficiently large .    the more difficult challenge , however , is the basic geometry .",
    "what long - lived plasma structures can create the necessary interference or wave trapping ?",
    "how can those structures be created or maintained so consistently , within a dynamic magnetosphere , to give a steady @xmath16 which has not changed over the seven years we have studied this star ?",
    "we have not come up with a good solution to this problem ; new ideas are needed .",
    "this model was also proposed to explain solar zebra bands ( e.g. , kuijpers 1975 , zhelezniakov & zlotnik 1975 , winglee & dulk 1986 ) .",
    "recent radio observations of solar flares ( chen 2011 ) are in good agreement with the model",
    ". if conditions are right ( as detailed in appendix [ app : dpr ] ) , resonant emission occurs when the plasma frequency is an integer multiple , @xmath17 , of the electron gyrofrequency : _",
    "p s _ b if the upper - hybrid turbulence excited by the instability converts to electromagnetic modes which can escape the plasma , we will see emission bands at discrete values of @xmath18 . in a non - uniform plasma",
    "the resonance for each integer @xmath17 occurs at different spatial locations ; the band spacing depends on the specific structure of the plasma density and magnetic field .",
    "zheleznyakov ( 2012 ) suggested this mechanism can also account for the emission bands in the high - frequency interpulse .",
    "while we also find this model promising , two problems are apparent .",
    "one problem is the plasma setting .",
    "the double plasma resonance requires superthermal particles moving _ across _ a weak magnetic field ( with @xmath19 ) .",
    "this situation arises naturally in the magnetic bottles created by solar coronal loops , from which only particles with low pitch angles can escape . however , such geometry is not part of our standard picture for the pulsar magnetosphere , where particle beams moving _ along _ the magnetic field are thought to be common ( e.g. , secs . [ howdotheyshine ] or [ sporadicbursts ] ) .",
    "perhaps magnetic traps can form in dynamic regions of the upper magnetosphere , or associated with neutral current sheets ( e.g. zheleznyakov 2012 ) .",
    "a second problem is the numbers . to put the resonant frequencies in the radio band ,",
    "the plasma density must be high and the magnetic field extremely low . to get @xmath20 ghz , the plasma must have @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 g. referring to table [ table : crabparameters ] , we see these parameter ranges do not easily fit anywhere in the standard picture of the magnetosphere . higher densities and much lower fields are needed .",
    "perhaps the necessary magnetic loops or current sheets , if they do exist in the upper magnetosphere , have the right parameters ; but no models yet predict such structures . once again , new ideas are needed .",
    "the spectral emission bands are not the only unusual property of the high - frequency interpulse . unlike main pulses and low - frequency interpulses , high - frequency interpulses are partially dispersed _ within the magnetosphere _",
    "before they leave the pulsar .",
    "in addition , their linear position angle shows no rotation across the entire mean - profile component .",
    "both properties give us additional clues on the origin of high - frequency interpulses .",
    "values for main pulses ; right panel shows @xmath24 for high - frequency interpulses .",
    "observed at center frequency 6500 mhz , with bandwidth 1 ghz ; plotted against the rotation phase at which each pulse arrived ( compare the mean profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanprofiles ] ) .",
    "see hankins ( 2016 ) for details of method .",
    "the solid lines show the jodrell bank value ( corresponding to @xmath25 ) ; the dotted lines are the mean @xmath24 for each set of pulses .",
    "dispersion of main pulses is approximately consistent with the jodrell bank value , but high - frequency interpulses have significant _ intrinsic _ dispersion ( @xmath26 ) , with large pulse - to - pulse scatter . ]      to quantify magnetospheric dispersion , we use the dispersion measure ( `` dm '' ) , defined as follows . the signal propagation time from a cosmic source depends on the group velocity in the plasma through which it propagates : @xmath27 . for cold , weakly magnetized plasma ( such as the interstellar medium ) , the dispersion relation is well known , and we have t_p ( ) ( dm )  ^-2 = n dz [ dm_defn ] thus , the difference in pulse arrival times at two frequencies measures the column density between the signal source and us .",
    "this quantity is conventionally expressed as the dm , with units of 3 ( 1 3 @xmath28@xmath29 ) .",
    "nearly all of the dispersion for the crab pulsar comes from the large plasma column between us and the pulsar  plasma in the crab nebula and the intervening interstellar medium . to focus on the small contribution from the pulsar itself",
    ", we express our results relative to the average dm which is tracked monthly by the jodrell bank radio observatory.pulsar/crab.html .",
    "] this excess dm for an individual pulse , relative to the jodrell bank value , we call @xmath24 .",
    "[ fig : dmscatter ] shows @xmath24 values for main pulses and high - frequency interpulses on a typical observing day .",
    "we find @xmath24 for main pulses is approximately consistent with zero ; the jodrell bank values describe the main pulse well .",
    "however , @xmath24 for high - frequency interpulses differs significantly from zero and fluctuates strongly from pulse to pulse .",
    "it can vary from nearly zero to @xmath30 3 , on a timescale of a few minutes .",
    "we note that observations of main pulses and high - frequency interpulses were interspersed with each other during a typical observing run .",
    "no intervening foreground `` screen '' could change rapidly enough , and just in phase with the pulsar s rotation , to exist only in front of the high - frequency interpulse .",
    "it is therefore clear that the excess dm of the high - frequency interpulse comes from the pulsar itself , not an intervening screen .",
    "we find no evidence that @xmath24 depends on observing frequency between 5 and 30 ghz where we have captured high - frequency interpulses .",
    "this suggests the magnetospheric dispersion law obeys @xmath31  although it need not be the cold plasma law assumed in equation ( [ dm_defn ] ) . we note that a few @xmath24 values in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmscatter ] are negative .",
    "we do not interpret this as inverted dispersion behavior ( @xmath32 ) in the pulsar .",
    "rather , it seems likely that the jodrell bank value , which is based on mean profiles , contains a small contribution , the mean excess dispersion , @xmath33 , from the pulsar itself .",
    "interpreting our result in terms of plasma conditions in the emission region is difficult , because we do not know the true dispersion law in the region .",
    "magnetospheric dispersion relations have been well studied only for low - altitude polar cap regions ( e.g arons & barnard 1986 , melrose & gedalin 1999 ) . while the effective dm has not been calculated for these laws , we suspect the more complex physical situation in such strongly magnetized regions would cause more complex @xmath34 behavior than the simple form in equation ( [ dm_defn ] ) .    as a possible example of dispersion in the upper magnetosphere ,",
    "consider dispersion in a relativistic , weakly magnetized plasma .",
    "if @xmath35 measures the mean internal energy of the plasma , the dm over a path @xmath36 turns out to be @xmath37 ( following , e.g. shcherbakov 2008 ) .",
    "guessing @xmath38 for a high - altitude emission zone , we need @xmath39 @xmath22 to account for the typical @xmath40 3 we see in the high - frequency interpulse . comparing this result to the high - altitude gj densities ( table [ table : crabparameters ] )",
    ", we find a density enhancement @xmath41 would be needed .",
    "this is generally consistent with predictions of pair cascade models , as long as @xmath35 is not too large .    the more interesting clue , however , is the @xmath24 variability .",
    "the plasma column around or above the emission site fluctuates by @xmath39@xmath22 , on timescales of no more than a few minutes .",

    "we argued in sec .",
    "[ causticsandfriends ] that the phase coincidence of the high - frequency interpulse and the high - energy pulse p2 suggests the two features originate in similar parts of the magnetosphere . however , if the high - frequency interpulse comes from a wide range of altitudes ",
    "say throughout a slot gap or an outer gap  it would be depolarized by caustic effects ( dyks 2004 ) .",
    "the strong polarization of the high - frequency interpulse tells us caustic depolarization is not important for this component .",
    "therefore , its emission zone must occupy only a small fraction of the extended caustic region that is probably the source of pulsed high - energy emission .",
    "figure [ fig : hfip_pa ] also shows that the polarized position angle remains constant throughout a single pulse .",
    "this angle is independent of the rotation phase at which the pulse appears .",
    "for example , the two pulses in figure [ fig : hfip_pa ] arrived at rotation phases separated by @xmath43 ( which can be compared to the @xmath44 width of the mean - profile component ; hankins 2015 ) , yet both pulses show the same , steady polarization angle .",
    "the position angle of pulsar radio emission reveals the direction of the magnetic field in the emission zone .",
    "radio emission is polarized either parallel or perpendicular to the local field , depending on the emission model .",
    "the polarization angle observed at earth therefore depends on the direction of the field as projected on the sky plane .",
    "a change of angle through a pulse is interpreted as a change of magnetic field direction .",
    "the classic example is radiation from the low - altitude polar gap , which is a region with diverging field lines .",
    "as the star rotates past the line of sight , creating the radio pulse , the projected field direction rotates across the pulse ( e.g. radhakrishnan & cooke 1969 ) .",
    "the lack of such position - angle rotation in the high - frequency interpulse tells us the direction of the magnetic field is constant throughout its emission region .",
    "the field does not diverge within the region , as it does in the polar gap .",
    "its direction does not change with time , as might be expected in a turbulent region dominated by plasma inertia .",
    "the emission region for the high - frequency interpulse must be inhomogeneous  in order to account for the variable dispersion  but must also contain an ordered magnetic field . perhaps we are seeing a region filled with field - aligned density fluctuations .",

    "show the emission zone for that component is a localized , dynamic region that is probably threaded by a uniform magnetic field .",
    "our analysis makes it clear that we do not yet have all the answers about the pulsar s magnetosphere and how it makes coherent radio emission .",
    "we have , however , learned some useful lessons which should help us going forward .",

    "come from localized zones within extended high - energy emission regions  probably gaps or separatrices associated with each magnetic pole .",
    "we infer this from several facts .",
    "the main pulse and low - frequency interpulse appear at the same rotation phases as the two strong components of the high - energy mean profile , and the viewing angle of the star does not allow a low - altitude polar cap origin for the latter .",
    "furthermore , these two components have the same radio characteristics .",
    "this suggests they come from the same emission physics , which is consistent with their origin in two similar regions connected to the two magnetic poles .",

    "the high - frequency interpulse has very different characteristics from the other two .",
    "this suggests it comes from a region in which different emission physics is operating , but we do not know where that is . because the high - frequency and low - frequency interpulses appear at similar rotation phases , we might think they come from different parts of one polar caustic . however , the most likely models suggest the high - frequency interpulse arises in a dense , turbulent region with uniform magnetic field direction .",

    "whatever drives the driver must also be sporadic .",
    "the energy source builds up , is depleted to radio emission , and is soon regenerated to repeat the cycle .",
    "if the driver is a relativistic particle beam  as is likely for the main pulse and low - frequency interpulse  the duty cycle reflects oscillatory behavior of parallel electric fields which drive the beams .",
    "this picture is generally consistent with the behavior expected for unsteady pair cascades in gap regions . if the main pulse and low - frequency interpulse come from high - altitude caustic regions associated with the star s two magnetic poles , an unsteady `` sparking '' cycle must occur there , just as has been predicted for the low - altitude polar cap .",
    "the driver is less certain for the high - frequency interpulse , because its radio emission mechanism is less clear .",
    "perhaps unsteady reconnection is taking place in the mysterious region which gives rise to this component .",
    "@xmath45 _ the radio emission regions are either denser , or more tenuous , than predicted by standard pair cascade models , but we do not know which . _",
    "radio bursts in main pulses and low - frequency interpulses are clumps of nanoshots : short - lived , narrow - band , polarized flashes of radio emission .",
    "no models yet proposed can fully explain the nanoshots , but some come close .",
    "one class of models involves strong plasma turbulence , either directly ( via soliton collapse ) or indirectly ( via the bunched response of the driving beam ) .",
    "these models require fairly low densities within the emission zones ",
    "comparable to , or somewhat above , the gj density .",
    "an alternative model invokes emission from a cyclotron instability .",
    "this model requires substantially higher densities in the emission zones , significantly above the gj density for the region and also well above densities predicted by current pair cascade models .",
    "none of these models are the final word on the nanoshots , but all of them appear to disagree with predictions of the pair cascade models .    two other arguments also suggest high densities . while the emission physics behind the high - frequency interpulse is not well understood , the promising double - resonant model of the spectral bands requires high densities in the relevant emission zone .",
    "in addition , some models of the crab s pulsar wind nebula require high densities in the wind leaving the pulsar . neither of these models is likely to be the final word on the high - frequency interpulse or the nebular wind , but both suggest densities higher than pair cascade models can produce .",
    "we conclude that the pair cascade  the only mechanism yet proposed to increase magnetospheric density over the fiducial gj value  is not yet understood .",
    "@xmath45 _ radio emission can be a powerful probe of magnetospheric conditions , but the models need more work . _    we have discussed the radio emission models we find the most promising at present , and the limitations of each one .",
    "models based on plasma turbulent emission have been extended to nonlinear regimes , and thus can address short - lived nanoshots .",
    "however , they are restricted to electrostatic turbulence in strongly magnetized regions , so they can not account for circular polarization in the nanoshots .",
    "models based on cyclotron emission have been constructed to admit circular polarization .",
    "however , they have not been developed past the linear regime , so they can not address the behavior of the nanoshots .",
    "models based on solar zebra bands are a promising approach to the spectral emission bands , but they require unusual physical situations which are not part of our standard picture of the magnetosphere .",
    "our opinion is that these models  which we have highlighted  can benefit by continued development , and help us truly understand conditions in the high - altitude radio emission zones .",
    "these are not the only options , however .",
    "many other models , including those listed in appendix [ app : radioemissionmodels ] , have promise but have not been developed to the point where they can be compared to data in any quantitative way .",
    "perhaps one of them will turn out , in the end , to be a better answer for radio emission from the crab pulsar .",
    "we are grateful to gregory benford , maxim lyutikov and don melrose for entertaining discussions and thoughtful reviews that have helped our understanding and appreciation of pulsar emission physics .",
    "we particularly thank glenn jones and many of our students , including david moffett , jeff kern , jared crossley , tracey delaney , eric plum , joe dickerson , and james sheckard for their critical help at the telescopes during our observing sessions . the arecibo observatory is operated by sri international under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation , and in alliance with ana g. mndez - universidad metropolitana and the universities space research association .",
    "the very large array and the green bank telescope are run by the national radio astronomy observatory , a facility of the national science foundation , operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .",
    "a wide range of models have been proposed over the years to explain the mechanism by which pulsars make coherent radio emission .",
    "the models vary in both the plasma - scale processes responsible for the radiation and the magnetosphere conditions under which they can operate .",
    "we do not attempt to give a full review of all possible radio emission models .",
    "the reader who has the strength can refer to the excellent reviews by melrose ( such as melrose 1995 ) for a more complete discussion . instead , we present overviews of several models which are commonly proposed and/or of particular interest for the crab pulsar .",
    "this mechanism is known to operate in solar radio bursts , but must be revisited for the high magnetic fields and relativistic pair plasmas relevant to pulsars .",
    "an instability  most likely two - stream , driven by an energetic particle beam  drives langmuir turbulence .",
    "that turbulence can not escape the plasma directly ; the langmuir waves must undergo some nonlinear process which converts part or all of their energy into escaping radiation .",
    "one possibility for this mode conversion involves modulational instabilities in strong langmuir turbulence that drive the growth ( `` collapse '' ) of localized knots of strong electric field , generally called solitons .",
    "nonlinear wave - wave coupling within the solitons generates bursts of electromagnetic radiation ",
    "`` nanoshots ''  which can escape the plasma ( e.g. robinson 1997 ) .",
    "weatherall ( 1997 , 1998 ) has studied this process in the pulsar context .",
    "the duration and spectrum of the nanoshots provide key comparisons to the data . in weatherall s simulations ,",
    "the rate of collapse of the electrostatic wave packet and subsequent conversion to electromagnetic modes is on the order of @xmath46 , where @xmath5 is the plasma frequency , and @xmath47 measures the strength of the turbulence ( @xmath48 is the turbulent wave electric field , and @xmath49 is the velocity spread of the pair plasma ) .",
    "the timescale for soliton collapse , and the duration of the nanoshot produced by each collapse , is therefore @xmath50 .",
    "the spectrum of the nanoshot will be be relatively narrowband , @xmath51 .",
    "weatherall found that strong , localized solitons appear for @xmath52 .",
    "weatherall s calculation assumes the radiative loss time scale is no longer than dynamic timescale for soliton collapse .",
    "this holds for packet sizes smaller than @xmath53 , which is consistent with other estimates of soliton size ( e.g. , weatherall & benford 1991 ) .",
    "polarization of the nanoshot is another key test .",
    "the collapsing soliton generates electromagnetic waves with polarization set by local plasma conditions .",
    "weatherall ( 1998 ) worked in the context of a strongly magnetized plasma . in this limit , emergent radiation around the plasma frequency  such as the nanoshots ",
    "linearly polarized along the magnetic field ( c.f .",
    "the o mode of arons & barnard 1986 ) .",
    "because strong langmuir turbulence is an incoherent superposition of localized solitons ( e.g. robinson 1997 ) , the radiation `` shot '' produced by each soliton is independent of those from its neighbors .",
    "this agrees nicely with the amplitude - modulated noise model suggested by high - time - resolution observations of pulsar radio emission ( rickett 1975 , also sec .",
    "[ mp_nanoshots ] ) .",
    "we compare this model to the crab pulsar in sec .",
    "[ spt ] .",
    "in this model , a relativistic beam encounters an electric field that varies in space and time .",
    "charges interacting with the field bunch together in a resonant interaction , and emit intense , coherent bursts of radiation . this process has been extensively studied in the lab , where particle beams pass through externally applied electromagnetic fields ( `` wigglers '' ) and radiate in a narrow cone beamed along the initial beam direction .",
    "this interesting idea has not been taken very far in pulsar applications .",
    "fung & kuijpers ( 2004 ) proposed a model in which a high-@xmath1 beam propagates through a strong , transverse em wiggler in a nearly unmagnetized background plasma .",
    "their simulations found the expected collective particle bunching , resulting in short - lived , narrow - band bursts of radiation , on a timescale governed by the frequency of the imposed em wiggler .",
    "however , neither an externally applied transverse wiggler , nor a nearly unmagnetized plasma , seem easy to maintain in a pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "a more likely possibility is that the particle beam generates its own parallel wiggler .",
    "baker ( 1988 ) , also weatherall & benford ( 1991 ) , suggested that when beam - driven langmuir turbulence becomes strong , both it and the driving beam will become spatially inhomogneous .",
    "in that situation , the collective motion of charge bunches interacting with electrostatic fluctuations in the turbulence results in coherent , forward - beamed radiation ( e.g. kato 1983 , schopper 2003 ) . for weak langmuir turbulence , these models predict linearly polarized radiation at @xmath54 , where @xmath5 is the plasma frequency of the background plasma . if turbulence is strong enough to collapse to solitons with scale @xmath55 , the compton - boosted beam radiation comes out at even higher frequencies @xmath56 ( weatherall & benford 1991 ) . in either case , the radiation frequency is significantly boosted relative to the plasma frequency of the background plasma .",
    "we consider this for the crab pulsar in sec .",
    "[ fem ] .      in this model ,",
    "a relativistic particle beam drives a cyclotron instability through the cyclotron resonance , @xmath57 .",
    "initially the @xmath58 resonance was invoked as a source of alfvn waves that could scatter particles to higher pitch angles as they passed into the wind , thus enabling synchrotron radiation ( machabeli & usov 1979 ) from the wind nebula .",
    "later authors , including kazbegi ( 1991 ) and lyutikov ( 1999 ) , suggested the anomalous cyclotron instability ( @xmath59 ) could be a direct radiation source , generating transverse waves which escape the plasma without needing mode conversion .",
    "this interaction causes a beam particle to increase its perpendicular momentum , at the same time that it emits a photon ; the energy of course comes from the parallel momentum .",
    "if wave modes in the background plasma are circularly polarized  as is assumed in their formulation  the emitted radiation is also circularly polarized .    in practice , this model is challenged in application to real pulsars , because of the weak magnetic fields and high plasma densities needed in order to put the emitted radiation in the radio band .",
    "it is also challenged by the lack of a clear path to produce short - lived nanoshots .",
    "we consider this model for the crab pulsar in sec .",
    "[ cie ] .      in this model ,",
    "a beam of relativistic charges moving along a magnetic field passes through and responds to an oscillating , parallel electric field .",
    "the particles radiate due to the acceleration caused by @xmath12 .",
    "melrose ( 1978 ) treated this process in the linear limit ( assuming @xmath1 stays nearly constant ) , and showed that the radiation comes out around @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the oscillation frequency of the e field .",
    "the radiation is linearly polarized parallel to the projected b field . to reach high brightness temperatures while retaining the single - particle linear analysis ,",
    "melrose suggested negative absorption ( maser amplification ) , but found the optical depth is much less than unity for typical pulsar conditions .",
    "the origin of the oscillating e field is unclear .",
    "melrose ( 1978 ) suggested oscillation at @xmath62 , a case which is very similar to free - electron maser models when the wigglers are self - generated langmuir waves .",
    "unsteady pair creation in an unshielded gap has also been suggested as the source of oscillating e fields ( e.g. levinson 2005 , timohkin & arons 2013 ) .",
    "these models are still being developed , and the time signature of the unshielded e field is not yet clear .",
    "in addition , recent work has explored electric fields strong enough to change the particle s lorentz factor significantly in one oscillation .",
    "this limit seems more relevant to high - enegy emission , and different treatments are still being explored in the literature ( melrose 2009 , reville & kirk 2010 ) .",
    "we find this mechanism interesting , but further work is needed before it can be usefully tested against pulsar data .",
    "lyubarskii & petrova ( 1996 ) considered stimulated compton scattering of pulsar radio emission by the magnetospheric pair plasma in the presence of background radiation .",
    "they were interested in scattering out of the radio beam , to explain low - frequency spectral turnovers seen in many pulsars .",
    "however in later papers , petrova ( e.g. , 2008 , 2009 ) suggested that stimulated scattering of radio emission out of the primary beam can be the origin of secondary components in a pulsar s mean profile ( e.g. the interpulse found in a few radio pulsars , or the several components of the crab s mean profile ) .",
    "unfortunately , the scattering opacity is hard to predict .",
    "it depends not just on magnetospheric parameters , but also varies with scattering regimes , so that the nature of the scattered radiation is extremely sensitive to assumed details of the scattering . while these models have some nice physics , the difficulty of quantifying the scattering opacity seems to preclude any robust test of them against the data .",
    "weatherall ( 2001 ) also considered stimulated compton scattering of a pulsar radio beam , but by strong turbulence in the magnetospheric plasma which the beam traverses .",
    "he mostly studied scattering in a nonmagnetized plasma , but did include a simple model restricting charge motion to one dimension ( appropriate for a high magnetic field ) .",
    "he finds that interesting amplification is possible if the plasma turbulence extremely strong ( e.g. turbulent energy density on the order of @xmath63 times the plasma temperature ) .",
    "however , he presents no discussion of how such strong turbulence can be maintained , nor does he consider radiation emitted by the turbulence itself ( as in sec .",
    "[ app : spt ] above ) .    in addition , both of these models assume the existence of an initial radio beam that can be amplified by stimulated scattering .",
    "the origin of the beam is not discussed . in that sense",
    ", neither of these models addresses the primary radio emission mechanism .",
    "given the many uncertainties , neither model can easily be compared to radio data .",
    "we do not pursue these any further .",
    "curvature emission by coherent bunches was one of the first models proposed for pulsar radio emission ( e.g. ruderman & sutherland 1975 , buschauer & benford 1976 ) .",
    "the general idea is that some instability groups @xmath64 charges into a coherently moving bunch that acts as a single large charge , @xmath65 ; this bunch then radiates curvature emission in the radio band .",
    "although this model initially seemed attractive , subsequent analysis ( e.g. , melrose 1978 , 1995 , and references therein ) identified several serious problems , including but not limited to the lack of an effective mechanism for forming the bunches , and the inability of the putative charge bunch to hold together long enough to radiate .",
    "this model has recently been revived by melikidze ( 2000 ; also gil 2004 ) .",
    "they follow karpman ( 1975 ) , who argued that langmuir solitons will be charge - separated if the two charge species have different masses .",
    "melikidze ( 2000 ) proposed that solitons in a pair plasma will also be charge - separated if the electrons and positrons have different relativistic streaming speeds .",
    "these authors then assumed that the solitons are sufficiently long - lived for the separated `` charges '' within each soliton to produce curvature emission .",
    "they further assumed that the plasma and soliton parameters are just what is needed to put the radiation in the radio band , and they ignored any other radiation caused by plasma dynamics within the soliton . given the large number of assumptions required by this model , and the lack of any demonstration of the solitons dynamic evolution , we do not consider this model any further .",
    "while simple curvature emission can not support maser action ( blandford 1975 ) , signal amplification is possible if particle curvature drift and/or field line distortion is taken into account ( e.g. luo & melrose 1992 , luo & melrose 1994 , lyutikov 1999 ) .",
    "however , the model details are very sensitive to the local field line curvature , which is poorly known in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "the situation is also complicated by the fact that the energetic particle beam necessary for either type of curvature maser also drives streaming instabilities that can lead to relativistic plasma emission ( see melrose 1995 ) .",
    "furthermore , there is still disagreement in the literature about the efficacy of this mechanism ( e.g. , kaganovich & lyubarsky 2010 ) .",
    "for all of these reasons , we do , not pursue this mechanism here .",
    "the spectral emission bands in the high - frequency interpulse have not been seen in any other pulsar . a variety of new models , specific to the emission bands , have been suggested since their discovery , but none have successfully explained all the data .",
    "we review several such models in hankins ( 2016 ) ; here we only discuss one , the double plasma resonance which may explain the `` zebra '' emission bands seen in type iv solar flares ( e.g. , kuijpers 1975 , zhelezniakov & zlotnik 1975 , winglee & dulk 1986 ) .",
    "this is another two - stage process .",
    "a maser instability generates upper hybrid waves at the cyclotron resonance , and those waves must be converted to transverse modes in order to escape the system .",
    "the instability growth is especially rapid at a set of discrete frequencies , _",
    "res = ( _ p^2 + _ b^2 ) ^1/2 = s _ b [ dpr_full ] where @xmath17 is the harmonic number , @xmath5 is the plasma frequency , @xmath4 is the electron cyclotron frequency , and the growth is fastest for waves propagating _ across _ the local magnetic field .",
    "if the plasma is non - uniform , with the magnetic field and plasma density varying on different scales , the resonance for each harmonic @xmath17 will be satisfied at a different spatial location , and multiple spectral bands will be seen .",
    "this is a stringent constraint . in order to produce a particular value of the band spacing , @xmath66 ,",
    "the local structure of the plasma density and magnetic field must have just the right behavior . from equation ( [ dpr_full ] ) , in the limit @xmath19 , the spacing between adjacent bands",
    "is usually written [ dpr_grads ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the gradient scales of the magnetic field and density : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "for general field and density distributions , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are functions of position , and equation ( [ dpr_grads ] ) becomes an implicit condition for the location at which equation ( [ dpr_full ] ) is satisfied for a given harmonic @xmath17 .",
    "in addition to the geometrical restriction , this theory has other important requirements on the plasma .",
    "the magnetic field must be weak , @xmath19 , and much lower than is predicted anywhere in the standard magnetosphere if @xmath71 is to lie in the radio band .",
    "the theory has only been developed for non - relativistic , electron - ion plasmas .",
    "zheleznyakov ( 2012 ) suggested the instability may also develop in pair plasmas , but we have not found that work in the literature .",
    "there must be an excess of energetic particles moving across the magnetic field ",
    "a situation which is common in solar coronal loops , but not expected in the standard magnetosphere .    despite the challenges",
