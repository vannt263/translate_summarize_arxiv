    "systematic search of double - peaked emission line profiles in large spectra databases ( e.g. sloan digital sky survey , sdss @xcite ) have been performed using different selection criteria , but the final confirmation is usually done by visual inspection @xcite . in this work , we present an automatic procedure to detect multi - component emission line profiles in large databases of spectra of galaxies based on the symmetry of the cross - correlation function .",
    "the cross - correlation ( c - c hereafter ) technique has been extensively used in astronomy to infer radial velocities @xcite .",
    "the c - c technique globally compares a problem spectrum with a reference spectrum or template .",
    "the c - c of two spectra analyses the similarity between one spectrum and a wavelength ( or velocity ) shifted version of the other , as a function of this wavelength ( or velocity ) shift .",
    "the c - c function only contains the frequencies that are common to both spectra .",
    "therefore , the c - c function provides a clear indication of the shift at which the two spectra are most similar and also a quantitative measure of that similarity .",
    "as long as the largest peak of the c - c function is symmetric , it might be used to derive the shift of the problem spectrum as well as its velocity dispersion in conjunction with the width of the template @xcite .",
    "when the two spectra are the same , the c - c function becomes the auto - correlation .",
    "we propose a methodology for searching multi - component / double - peaked emission line profiles in the spectra of galaxies based on the deviation from symmetry of the peak of the c - c function .",
    "details on the c - c technique can be found in @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the c - c algorithm might be used in the search for binary active galactic nuclei in large spectra databases ( e.g. sdss ) .",
    "it may be also used to locate spaxels with spectra showing multicomponent emission line profiles in integral field spectroscopic ( ifs ) surveys of galaxies ( e.g. the on - going calar alto legacy integral field area survey , califa @xcite or the mapping nearby galaxies at apo , manga ( http://dunlap.utoronto.ca/research/surveys/ ) ) .",
    "the procedure developed in this work is based on the symmetry of the c - c function nearby its main peak .",
    "the estimation of the shift and velocity dispersion of the spectra of galaxies might be obtained by fitting a smooth symmetric function to the peak of the c - c function @xcite . however ,",
    "c - c is not an even function and therefore , this approach is only valid when the shapes of the spectral features in the problem spectrum are similar to those in the reference spectrum .",
    "emission lines in the spectra of galaxies are commonly assumed to be fitted by gaussian profiles .",
    "if single gaussian profiles are assumed for emission lines in the template and problem spectra , the velocity shift and velocity dispersion of the problem spectrum can be derived by fitting a single gaussian to the peak of the c - c function ( see fig .",
    "[ model1]a , b ) .",
    "however , if the emission line profiles in the reference and in the problem spectrum are significantly different , the peak of the c - c function will be asymmetric ( see fig .",
    "[ model1]c , d ) .",
    "the reference spectrum must have a large signal - to - noise ratio and a spectral resolution similar to or better than the problem spectrum .",
    "as the c - c of two spectra is similar to their convolution , the spectral resolution of the c - c function might be significantly reduced during the c - c operations .",
    "this results in a significant reduction in the capability of detecting double - components ( see fig .",
    "[ model1]d ) .",
    "however , the template can be selected to have a negligible velocity dispersion compared to the problem spectrum .",
    "indeed , a variation of the c - c technique using delta functions has been successfully used for detection of binary stars @xcite . in this case , the c - c spectral resolution , and hence the capability of detecting double - components , strongly depends on the problem spectrum spectral resolution .",
    "moreover , the shape of the c - c peak will correspond to the average shape of the line profiles in the problem spectrum ( figures [ model1]e and [ model1]f ) .",
    "therefore , the presence of double or multiple components in emission line profiles is reduced to study the shape of the c - c peak profile .",
    "the c - c peak profile can be characterized by tracing its bisector .",
    "bisector shapes are commonly used in the analysis of the mechanisms that cause asymmetries and variations in stellar spectra ( * ? ? ?",
    "the bisector of a symmetric profile should remain at constant wavelength ( or velocity ) for all parts of the profile , dividing it into two equal parts ; any existing asymmetry between the base and the peak of the line will remain reflected in the shape of the bisector .",
    "bisectors for any profile can be constructed by connecting the midpoints of horizontal line segments spanning the width of the profile at a number of intensity positions inside the profile . the comparison of the c - c peak profile bisector ( v@xmath1 ) with the c - c peak velocity ( v@xmath2 , the remained value as if it were symmetric ) gives a reference value to identify the presence of various gaseous components in the profiles .",
    "this procedure does not infer the actual number of gaseous components forming the observed profile , but an evidence of the presence of various gaseous components ( at least two ) .",
    "the sign of v@xmath1-v@xmath2 also gives information about the equivalent wavelength ( velocity ) of the double / multiple components relative to the dominant component ( wavelength or velocity at the c - c peak ) : if the sign is positive , the secondary ( or equivalent ) component is red - shifted respect to the dominant component .",
    "a positive detection of double / multiple components in a galaxy spectrum will depend on the signal - to - noise of the c - c function and hence on the signal - to - noise of the problem spectrum .",
    "figure [ model2 ] shows the bisectors of the c - c peak functions for the examples in figure [ model1 ] . tracing the bisector on a single emission line profile would also provide evidences of the presence of double / multiple components forming that profile",
    "however , any observational or instrumental signature ( e.g. cosmic - ray ) not properly removed during the data reduction process and affecting the selected single emission line could result in an asymmetric line bisector and hence in an spurious double / multiple component detection .",
    "including several emission lines in the selected cross - correlation spectral range will smoothed any undesirable feature affecting a single - line since the shape of c - c peak function will correspond to their average shape . moreover , as the c - c function also provides a quantitative measure of the similarity between the problem and template , other advantage of tracing the bisector on the c - c peak function instead of on single emission line profiles is that any shape of the line profiles can be selected to generate the template . here",
    ", we have assumed gaussian profiles for the emission lines to create the template but any other profile shape could be assumed ( e.g. lorentz profiles ) .",
    "the c - c technique uses the information contained in all the lines of the selected spectral range for calculating the c - c function .",
    "the resulting shape of the c - c peak corresponds to an average shape of the line profiles in the problem spectrum .    in order to calculate the c - c function ,",
    "it is necessary to prepare the problem spectrum following these steps :    * the ends of the c - c spectral range are selected at the continuum to avoid discontinuities at the edges . *",
    "the data are divided by the continuum to remove any residual curvature in the continuum . * in order to minimize edge effects , the continuum is subtracted ( just subtract the unity when step 2 was performed ) .    when a stellar fit had been carried out previously and properly subtracted from the original spectra , steps 2 and 3 can be stripped .",
    "the reference spectrum is generated including as many delta functions as single emission lines are expected in the spectral range selected to apply the c - c technique .",
    "the wavelength ( or velocity ) position of these delta functions corresponds to the center of the emission lines .",
    "different weights ( in flux ) can be given to the delta functions to account for fix intensity ratio between emission lines according to atomic parameters .",
    "noise contribution is not desirable to be included in the template to avoid degradation of the signal - to - noise when the c - c function is computed .",
    "both template and problem spectra are normalized to the maximum of the brightest emission line in the selected wavelength . when the reference has been generated and the problem spectrum has been rectified , the cross - correlation function can be computed .",
    "the maximum of the cross - correlation function is located and a gaussian is fitted to this peak to obtain a better precision in the determination of the velocity shift between template and problem spectra ( v@xmath2 ) than the pixel size / resolution element .",
    "the bisector of the c - c peak function can be traced by calculating the midpoints of horizontal lines segments slicing the c - c peak profile at a number of intensities ( e.g. twenty intensity positions , from 100% to 5% in steps of 5% ) . in order to detect asymmetries",
    ", we can compute the difference between v@xmath2 and the bisector at different intensities ( e.g. v@xmath1(i ) , for i=1,n , being n the total number of intensity positions ) .",
    "we will have as many v@xmath2-v@xmath1 as intensities have been selected to trace the bisector . if @xmath3v denotes the size of the resolution element , then :    * a blue asymmetry is detected when v@xmath1-v@xmath2 @xmath4v * a red asymmetry is detected when v@xmath1-v@xmath2 @xmath5v    for the implementation of the procedure , we calculate the number of @xmath6v@xmath1-v@xmath2(i)@xmath6 values ( for i=1,n , being n the total number of intensity positions ) larger than @xmath3v ( n@xmath7 ) and also the number of v@xmath1-v@xmath2(i ) smaller than -@xmath3v ( n@xmath8 ) and larger than @xmath3v ( n@xmath9 ) , considering that :    * when n@xmath7=n@xmath8 a pure blue asymmetry in the profile is detected , and at least two components are present . * when n@xmath7=n@xmath9 a pure red asymmetry in the profile is detected , and at least two components are present .",
    "* when n@xmath10 n@xmath9 or / and n@xmath10 n@xmath8 then the profile presents blue and red asymmetries depending on the intensity level ( multi - asymmetries hereafter ) , indicating the presence of multiple gaseous components forming the observed emission line profiles .",
    "obviously , the level of noise in the problem spectrum affects the detection of asymmetries . in this sense",
    ", a signal - to - noise threshold is defined to reduce the number of false positive detections of double / multiple components on emission line profiles in the spectra of galaxies .",
    "removing bisector lower levels might also help to avoid false positive detections due to poor signal - to - noise of the spectra .",
    "in practice , we consider a positive asymmetry detection ( blue , red , or multi - asymmetries ) when n@xmath7 is equal or larger than 2 , that is , at least two intensity levels tracing the bisector of the c - c peak function must satisfied that @xmath6v@xmath1-v@xmath2(i)@xmath6 @xmath11v .      in this section",
    ", we present some examples to illustrate the results from the proposed procedure for searching double or multiple gaseous components in the spectra of galaxies applied on ifs data .",
    "we have used the ifs data of the central 24@xmath1220@xmath13 of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 presented in @xcite .",
    "ngc  1068 is the nearest and brightest example of a barred galaxy with an active galactic nucleus .",
    "the presence of several kinematically distinct gaseous components in the central region of ngc  1068 is evident from the large amount of emission - line profiles obtained using different instruments and techniques @xcite .",
    "careful visual examination ( see fig . [ oiii_profiles ] ) and description of the spectra @xcite[e.g ] revealed the presence of a minimum of three different gaseous systems in ngc  1068 . when studying ifs data , the visual inspection of the spectra is a tedious task but accessible for examining a several hundred of spectra .",
    "this is not the case for the large amount of spectra provided by ifs surveys ( e.g. califa or manga surveys ) of galaxies .",
    "figure [ oiii_profiles ] shows the [ oiii]@xmath0 line profiles at each observed position of ngc  1068 as a spectra diagram @xcite .",
    "these profiles offer a large variety of examples to test the developed algorithm .          applying the proposed procedure of studying the symmetry of the c - c peak function explained in section  2 to the spectra from the central region of ngc  1068 , we can point out the following :    * only 12% of the emission lines profiles in the central 24@xmath1220@xmath13 of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 ( fig . [ oiii_profiles ] )",
    "seems to present symmetric profiles .",
