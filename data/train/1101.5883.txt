    "however , before one can study the genuine x - ray emission of the hot interstellar plasma in early type galaxies , one must excise or account in some manner for the contribution of other constituents of galaxy emission .",
    "revnivtsev et al .",
    "( 2008 ) summarized the contributions from low mass x - ray binaries ( see also @xcite ) and the fainter emission from the population of unresolved cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and coronally active binary stars ( abs ) ( see revnivtsev for a discussion of the origin of the faint diffuse emission ) .",
    "the appearance of the latest generation of x - ray observatories with fine angular resolution ( e.g. , as high as @xmath8 from the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ) provides the possibility to subtract / mask the contribution of the brightest x - ray binaries in nearby galaxies .",
    "the contribution of fainter x - ray binaries is often estimated via extrapolation of the observed luminosity function of bright sources towards lower luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which gilfanov ( 2004 ) has shown to be a good estimator for this component .    in the past , is has also been assumed that all emission lines at energies @xmath91 - 1.5 kev , visible in the spectra of galaxies , originate in a hot interstellar plasma ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is now clear ( see @xcite ) that faint discrete galactic x - ray sources , namely cataclysmic variables and coronally active ( usually binary ) stars , provide an important contribution to the x - ray emission of galaxies ( after subtraction of the contribution from the brightest sources ) and this should be taken into account .",
    "moreover , as the x - ray emission from these stars naturally includes a contribution from optically thin plasma of moderate or low temperatures , their spectra contain exactly the same lines that are usually thought to originate in the interstellar plasma .",
    "until now we have had very limited knowledge of the broad band luminosity function of the population of faint galactic x - ray sources ( however , there are studies of different sub - populations , see e.g. @xcite ) . essentially , the best available broad band ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) luminosity function was derived from all sky surveys of rxte and rosat observatories by @xcite .",
    "observations of the peculiar galactic center region @xcite added strong new support to the universality of the luminosity function over the entire galaxy .",

    "observation of the galactic bulge region  the chandra bulge field ( cbf ) ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* )  allows us to probe the luminosity function of galactic x - ray sources ( mostly the old stellar population because sources are located in the galactic bulge region , see @xcite ) to remarkably low luminosities .",
    "in particular , in the cbf , we can probe to @xmath12   at the galactic center distance and thus to compare the derived luminosity function to that derived from the solar vicinity @xcite    in this paper we explore the statistical properties of the discrete sources detected in the cbf and present their luminosity function and cumulative emissivity .",
    "we used all   acis - i observations of the cbf ( observation i d # 5934 , 6365 , 6362 , 9500 , 9501 , 9502 , 9503 , 9504 , 9505 , 9854 , 9855 , 9892 , 9893 ) with total effective exposure time @xmath13 ks .",
    "chandra _ data were reduced following the standard procedure fully described in @xcite .",
    "the detector background was modeled using the stowed dataset ( http://cxc.harvard.edu/contrib/maxim/stowed ) . in this work",
    "we restrict our study to the circular region of @xmath14 arcmin - radius around @xmath15 , @xmath16 , close to the telescope optical axis ( the region dubbed hres in @xcite ) , optimizing the angular resolution of the instrument and thus its sensitivity .    to further enhance the sensitivity of the observation , we have searched for sources in the summed image of the hres region in the broad 0.57  kev energy band .",
    "the sensitivity limit is @xmath17 erg  s@xmath18  @xmath19 .",
    "it is calculated for the energy spectrum of photons collected within the cbf in the energy band 0.57 kev , approximated by a combination of models mekal with @xmath20 kev ( abundance of elements was fixed at 0.1 of the solar value ) and bremss with @xmath21 kev from the xspec package  the simplest model which allows us to reproduce the broad band properties of the energy spectrum .",
    "our model also includes interstellar absorption with column density @xmath22 @xmath19 .",

    "the spectral model was convolved with 100 ev gaussian function to mimic a finite energy resolution of the instrument ]    energy spectrum , collected from hres is presented in fig.[total_spectrum ] .",
    "contribution of mekal spectral component to total 0.57 kev flux is @xmath25  , contribution of bremss spectral component is @xmath26  .",
    "the adopted sensitivity limit corresponds to a minimum detectable unabsorbed luminosity @xmath27 erg  s@xmath18 at a source distance of 8 kpc , at which most of the galactic objects in this field are expected to reside . in total , we have detected 473 sources with statistical significance @xmath28 ( minimum number of counts per source is about 10 ) .",
    "statistical significance of detection was calculated with the help of numerical simulations of the image taking into account the background and the exposure map .    due to the significant interstellar absorption of x - rays in the cbf and the great diversity of spectral shapes of detected sources ( e.g. ,",
    "the 27 kev/0.52 kev hardness ratio of cataclysmic variables and coronally active stars may differ by more than an order or magnitude ) , it is hard to make a definitive conversion of source count rates observed by _",
    "chandra _ into intrinsic fluxes and luminosities in the broad 0.510 kev energy band . therefore , despite the detection of sources in the broad energy band 0.57 kev , we present here only statistics of sources for the energy band 210 kev . technically , the source fluxes were measured by _",
    "chandra _ in the energy band 27 kev and subsequently recalculated into the 210 kev energy band assuming the simple analytic form of the spectral fit described above , appropriate for the summed spectrum of all sources .",
    "we find that 1 count in the range 27 kev per image ( 898 ks effective live time ) corresponds to a source flux @xmath29  in the energy band 210 kev .",
    "according to statistics of x - ray sources in the solar vicinity @xcite , the majority of sources with luminosities @xmath30   are old binaries , including magnetic and non - magnetic cataclysmic variables , rs cvn systems , algol - type binaries , w uma - typa binaries .",
    "this allows us to safely assume that their density distribution is directly proportional to the stellar mass density distribution in the cbf .",
    "therefore , it is useful to obtain the luminosity function of sources in the cbf normalized to the total mass of stars within the studied volume .    the stellar density distribution along the line of sight in the cbf was previously studied in @xcite .",
    "the main substructures of the galaxy visible in the cbf are the galactic disk , the galactic bulge and the nuclear stellar disk ( nsd ) .",
    "the majority of sources reside in the galactic bulge and are located at @xmath318 kpc . in @xcite , it was shown that the rms - width of the apparent magnitude distribution of red clump giants ( rcg ; considered to be almost standard candles ) is approximately 0.28@xmath32 ( this rms scatter includes the intrinsic scatter of the rcg population , therefore the scatter caused by the distance variations alone is even smaller than 0.28@xmath32 ) .",
    "this means that the error in source luminosities , associated with the assumption that all sources in the cbf are located at 8 kpc , is less than @xmath33 .    to determine the influence of these distance variations on the resulting luminosity function , and on our estimates of the luminosity density of sources",
    ", we have simulated a set of sources assuming that their intrinsic luminosity function has the shape @xmath34 ( which is close to what is actually observed ) and distributed the sources along the line of sight according to the stellar density distribution , described in @xcite .",
    "the resulting luminosity function does not change by more than 10% and the luminosity density changes by only @xmath35 in comparison to the case of constant source distances .    according to the simple model of the stellar mass distribution ( including",
    "the bulge , disk and the nuclear disk components ) adopted in @xcite , the total stellar mass angular surface density in cbf is @xmath36 arcmin@xmath37 .",
    "we corrected for the fact that this stellar surface density corresponds to a @xmath38 higher nir surface brightness than that measured by _ spitzer _ in this area @xcite . therefore in our subsequent analysis",
    "we adopt a stellar surface density @xmath39 arcmin@xmath37 in the cbf and assume that the vast majority of rcgs lie at a distance 8 kpc .",
    "this surface mass density is obtained via integration of the adopted density profile up to further edge of the galaxy , i.e. up to @xmath3120 kpc distance from the sun .",
    "approximately 85% of the all mass contained in small solid angles in the direction of cbf is located within 1 kpc of the galactic center .",
    "the luminosity of the brightest sources in our survey is marked by an arrow . ]    in calculating the number - flux function ( or luminosity function ) of sources , we confined our analysis to the flux range where we expect no strong influence from incompleteness effects , i.e. , where we detect more than @xmath40 counts from sources in the energy band used for source detection ( 0.57 kev ) and more than 5 counts from sources in the energy band 210 kev . in principle , it is possible to continue the luminosity function toward lower luminosities , but accounting for the variety of spectral shapes at these luminosities ( cf .",
    "soft spectra of coronally active stars and hard spectra of dwarf novae ) introduces significant uncertainties  the same number of counts in total energy band , used for detection of sources , ( 0.5 - 7 kev ) might correspond to significantly different energy flux in 2 - 10 kev energy band .",

    "we calculated the anticipated number of agns in every luminosity bin , assuming the moretti et al .",
    "analytic form of the agn number flux function ( in the energy band 210 kev ) .",
    "the agn contribution has its own uncertainty mainly caused by either poisson noise of the number of sources in the field , or by cosmic variance . according to simple estimates of these uncertainties from the cosmos survey @xcite , in the small hres field",
    ", the contribution from poisson noise of the number of sources should dominate .",
    "we see that this noise is comparable with the poisson noise of the number of galactic sources in the field .",

    "therefore , our estimates of the cumulative emissivity of sources lack the contribution from higher luminosity sources ( in particular , luminous cataclysmic variables ) .",

    "this is just @xmath62% of the luminosity density of sources with @xmath55   in the cbf ( @xmath63   per @xmath7 ) .",
    "this suggests that most of the detected sources in this luminosity range are active binary stars .",
    "active binary stars produce softer x - ray emission than do cataclysmic variables in general , so that @xmath64 for them ( see e.g. @xcite , see @xcite for review of x - ray emission of ab sources ) .",
    "this is of high importance for soft x - ray studies of other galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] , we show the cumulative spectrum of the faintest sources detected in the cbf ( which is clearly softer than the summed spectrum of all detected sources ) and compare it to the energy spectrum of the typical bright active binary star ii peg ( see more details on spectra of ii peg in @xcite ) . the dashed curve in the figure shows a simple broken power law fit to the spectrum of ii peg , arbitrarily scaled and absorbed with interstellar column density @xmath53 @xmath19 , appropriate for the cbf .",
    "we see that the spectrum of the faintest cbf sources is compatible with that of ab stars of the appropriate luminosity . however , the considerable absorption at energies @xmath65  kev prevents seeing the full luminosity density of such soft sources . without interstellar absorption , the cbf brightness at energies @xmath66 kev would be several times higher .",
    "we have analysed statistical properties of x - ray sources detected in deep observations of the _ chandra _ bulge field .",
    "the results of this work can be summarized as follows :    * the luminosity function of detected x - ray sources in the luminosity range probed by our observations ( @xmath67 ) and corrected for the contribution of extragalactic sources ( agns ) , is relatively flat ( @xmath68 constant ) and consistent with that determined from a sample of sources in the solar vicinity by @xcite . *",
