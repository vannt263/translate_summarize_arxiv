    "however , it must be commented that the interpretation of the nmc result ( [ gsr ] ) can be affected by both the uncertainties because of nuclear corrections ( since the deuterium was used as effective neutron target ) and low-@xmath11 extrapolation .",
    "these problems were not adequately addressed in ref.@xcite .",
    "a more sophisticated extraction of the isospin asymmetry from dis requires both the improvements in the accuracy of the measurements and the extension of the kinematic region of data . in this respect",
    "we note that the planned experiments after tjnaf upgrade to 12 @xmath12 beam energy will significantly improve the accuracy of the measurement of @xmath0 in the region of intermediate @xmath13 .",

    "unfortunately the region @xmath17 , which is crucial for the evaluation of the gottfried sum rule , can not be directly probed at this machine . for this reason in what follows",
    "we discuss two possibilities to study the isospin asymmetries using data from upgraded tjnaf machine .",
    "one possible way to study the isospin asymmetries is to perform a combined analysis of ( future ) tjnaf data and nmc data at low @xmath11 , or to extrapolate future tjnaf data to the region of low @xmath11 using different sets of parton distributions , e.g. the one of ref.@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : f2p - n ] shows the difference @xmath18 , extracted from the next - to - next - to - leading order qcd analysis of the world experimental data on the charged lepton - nucleon dis cross - section @xcite .",
    "two solid lines give a band of the isospin asymmetry for the leading twist term and the dashed lines give the band accounting for the twist-4 term .",
    "the latter one turned out to be small , like in the first moment gottfried sum rule @xcite and for higher moments as well @xcite .",
    "however , the dominant uncertainty in the isospin asymmetry is given by non - perturbative effects .",
    "new clas++ data will give a better constraint on the twist-4 term in the isospin symmetry breaking effects in dis in the non - resonance region , which for @xmath19 gev@xmath3 corresponds to @xmath20 .",
    "this will allow a more sophisticated treatment of higher - twist terms in the analysis of @xmath0 data , similar to those in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the experimental methods of tjnaf measurement of the neutron structure @xmath0 from the deuteron target allows to eliminate a certain type of nuclear corrections by using the proton recoil detector .",
    "such a recoil detector for clas is now under construction at jefferson lab  @xcite .",
    "new hardware will not affect the accessible in clas kinematics , which due to almost 4@xmath21 acceptance permits to measure the inclusive cross section simultaneously in a wide region of @xmath11 and @xmath13 @xcite . therefore , after tjnaf upgrade to 12 gev beam energy , a combination of two measurements  the measurement of the neutron @xmath0 from the deuteron target using the proton recoil detector and the measurement of the proton @xmath0 from the hydrogen target  will allow the extraction of isospin symmetry breaking effects .",
    "the measurement of the neutron structure function is already planed at clas , while the extraction of the proton structure function @xmath0 does not require an additional beam time and can be performed within an analysis of electron run data collected during other experiments , as it was done in  @xcite .",

    "clas++ data can provide more than a half of the value of the gottfried integral , assuming the @xmath11 dependence of the proton and neutron structure functions is given by the parameterizations of ref .  @xcite .",
    "these parameterizations are quite reliable and give the value of gottfried integral 0.2314 at @xmath25 gev@xmath3 which is very close to the value 0.235@xmath260.026 , obtained at this @xmath13 by nmc collaboration  @xcite",
    ".    however , it is obvious , that even at @xmath19 gev@xmath3 the major uncertainties of the measurement of the gottfried sum rule at clas++ come from the extrapolation to the region @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , even the uncertainties of the well - known nmc result ( [ gsr ] ) may be underestimated because of nuclear effects . in order to illustrate the integral strength of nuclear effects",
    "we have calculated the ratio @xmath27 in eq.([rgsr ] ) @xmath28 is the deuteron structure function and the integration is taken over the interval of bjorken @xmath11 which is linked to experimental conditions . in the absence of nuclear corrections @xmath29 that gives @xmath30 .",
