    "[ nocbb0 ] there do not exist quasi - isometric embeddings of a connected nonabelian nilpotent lie group equipped with a left invariant riemannian metric into a @xmath9 metric space .",
    "@xmath10 ( resp .",
    "@xmath11 ) metric spaces are spaces of curvature bounded above ( resp .",
    "below ) by @xmath12 is the sense of topanogov triangle comparison .",
    "thus , a @xmath0 metric space is a generalized space of nonpositive curvature while a @xmath9 metric space is a generalized space of nonnegative curvature .",
    "these include simply connected riemannian manifolds of nonpositive and nonnegative curvature respectively . in the literature ,",
    "@xmath0 spaces are also called hadamard spaces and @xmath11 spaces are called alexandrov spaces ( with curvature bounded below ) .",
    "we retain the earlier notion for simplicity and consistency",
    ". we will discuss these in detail later in the paper .",
    "in @xcite , wolf showed that a connected nonabelian nilpotent lie group equipped with a left invariant riemannian metric must contain 2-planes of both positive and negative curvatures .",
    "theorems [ nocat0 ] and [ nocbb0 ] can be viewed as a large scale analogue of this theorem of j. wolf .    while the large scale characteristics of such nilpotent lie groups may be interesting in their own right",
    ", we shall see that such investigations reduce to problems which are motivated by the now standard arguments used in the proof of mostow s rigidity theorem and its many extensions ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as well as many others ) . in the proofs of these results , one attempts to show that two candidate spaces ( e.g. two compact constant negative curvature spaces with isomorphic fundamental groups ) are isometric by exhibiting an equivariant quasi - isometry between their universal covers and showing that the existence of such a quasi - isometry must imply the existence of a true equivariant isometry .",
    "a common element in many such proofs is to reduce to an examination of the ideal boundaries of the two spaces in question .",
    "the quasi - isometries between the two spaces induce quasiconformal maps on the boundaries which then become the focus of the study . in the cases of the papers mentioned above , the tangent cones at points on the ideal boundaries are isometric to connected simply connected graded nilpotent lie group equipped with left invariant carnot - carathodory metrics .",
    "thus , a local analysis of the ideal boundaries involves an examination of the geometry of graded nilpotent lie groups with left invariant carnot - carathodory metrics .",
    "this provides a natural motivation for considering the geometry of such spaces and , in particular , of studying the quasi - conformal maps between them .",
    "it is a natural generalization to instead consider the quasi - conformal embeddings of such spaces .",
    "unfortunately , the study of such embeddings seems quite intractable but does provide motivation for various lines of study - for example the study of bilipschitz embeddings of such spaces .",
    "as we shall see , the proofs of theorems [ nocat0 ] and [ nocbb0 ] rest on a local analysis of bilipschitz embeddings of graded nilpotent lie groups with left invariant carnot - carathodory metrics into complete metric spaces which are _ locally _ @xmath10 or @xmath11 . for metric spaces which are locally @xmath10 ,",
    "i.e. for each point there is a closed ball about that point which is itself @xmath10 , we use the notation @xmath13 ( for `` curvature bounded above '' ) . note that , for a lower curvature bound , these distinctions are not necessary .",
    "in particular , we prove an intermediate theorem from which theorems [ nocat0 ] and [ nocbb0 ] follow :    [ inter ] let @xmath14 be a connected simply connected graded nilpotent lie group equipped with a left invariant carnot - carathodory metric and @xmath15 be an open set .",
    "then @xmath16 does not admit a bilipschitz embedding into any @xmath13 metric space or into any @xmath11 metric space .    to prove the main theorems from this intermediate theorem , we study some bilipschitz embedded invariants of graded nilpotent lie groups with left invariant carnot - carathodory metrics and use them to build local obstructions to quasi - isometric embeddings of nonabelian nilpotent lie groups with left invariant riemannian metrics into various metric spaces .",
    "next we give a brief outline of the argument and the paper and show how theorems [ nocat0 ] and [ nocbb0 ] follow from theorem [ inter ] .",
    "let @xmath3 be a connected simply connected nilpotent lie group with a left invariant riemannian metric @xmath17 and let @xmath2 be the induced distance function on @xmath3 .",

    "the asymptotic cone of a metric space @xmath4 is a limit metric space of the pointed dilated spaces @xmath21 for some sequence @xmath22 .",
    "since such spaces do not necessarily converge in the gromov - hausdorff topology , we use gromov s ultrafilter construction , choosing a nonprincipal ultrafilter @xmath23 ( see section [ tangcones ] for a definition ) to form the asymptotic cone @xmath24 . for precise details of the construction , we refer the reader to either @xcite or @xcite . for our purposes ,",
    "there are a few keys pieces of information .",
    "first , if @xmath1 is a nilpotent lie group with a left invariant riemannian metric , then pansu ( @xcite ) proved that the asymptotic cone is unique and isometric to @xmath25 , a graded nilpotent lie group equipped with a left invariant carnot - carathodory metric ( see section [ cc ] for definitions ) .",
    "second , an asymptotic cone of a @xmath0 space is also @xmath0 and an asymptotic cone to a @xmath9 space is also @xmath9 .",
    "these facts ( and references to their proofs ) are reviewed in section [ curv ] .",
    "third , the quasi - isometric embedding @xmath20 gives rise to an l - bilipschitz map @xmath19 between the cones @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the construction of this map depends on the choice of ultrafilter .",
    "thus , to prove theorems a and b , we must prove instead theorem [ inter ] .",
    "the paper is devoted to proving this intermediate theorem .",
    "the main technical result in the paper is that , in an appropriate sense , such an l - bilipschitz map is differentiable in certain directions almost everywhere .",
    "this is a generalization of a classical theorem of rademacher .",
    "our proof follows the same lines as a covering argument used in kleiner s proof of the differentiability of lipschitz maps from @xmath27 into metric spaces ( in @xcite ) , which is a special case of differentiability theory of section 1.9 in @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", kirchheim shows the metric differentiability of lipschitz maps @xmath28 where the targets are complete metric spaces .",

    ", we construct a tangent cone of @xmath19 at a point of differentiability . using this tangent cone",
    ", we can compare the local geometry of the two asymptotic cones .",
    "the local geometry of connected graded nilpotent lie groups with left invariant carnot - carathodory metrics is well understood and the differentiability allows us to `` push forward '' this structure to a tangent cone to the asymptotic cone of @xmath18 .",
    "when this asymptotic cone has additional structure , this allows us to measure the compatibility of these two objects . in the case of theorem [ inter ] , this structure provides estimates on the rate of growth of the spread between two tangent cone geodesics which show that they spread apart sublinearly but do not remain a bounded distance from one another . comparing this to the spread of geodesics in the tangent cone to either a @xmath0 or @xmath9 space , we derive a contradiction which proves theorem [ inter ] .",

    "if we wish to consider @xmath62 we use the convention that @xmath63 ( please note that this convention is not standard in the literature ) .    for general lie groups , the campbell - baker - hausdorff formula provides a method for computing the product of two nearby group elements .",
    "we state it in the special case when @xmath3 is a simply connected graded nilpotent lie group . for a more general version and , for that matter ,",

    "in other words , we have the formula : @xmath71+\\frac{1}{12}[x,[x , y]]- \\frac{1}{12}[y,[x , y]]+ ... } \\ ] ]    in the case that @xmath3 is a graded nilpotent lie group , we use the following convention . let @xmath72 be the pieces of @xmath73 which lie in @xmath45 .",
    "thus , if @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 $ ] and so on .",
    "thus , the campbell - baker - hausdorff formula yields @xmath77 . using the campbell - baker - hausdorff formula",
    ", we easily confirm that @xmath78 is a group automorphism .    in subsequent sections",
    ", we will use repeatedly several properties of @xmath78 .",
    "we group them here as a lemma for easy reference :    [ ht ] let @xmath3 be a graded nilpotent lie group and let @xmath78 be the automorphism described above .    * for @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",

    "carnot - carathodory metrics arise in a variety of settings and have been the object of a great deal of study . in this work ,",
    "we examine graded nilpotent lie groups equipped with carnot - carathodory metrics and hence the definitions and propositions will be tailored for this small set of spaces . for a more general and comprehensive introduction to the theory ,",
    "the interested reader is encouraged to consult @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the rough idea of a carnot - carathodory metric is to measure the distance between two points by taking the infimum of the length of piecewise @xmath89 paths connecting the points over a restricted set of paths , those tangent to some subbundle of the tangent bundle .",
    "more precisely ( in our setting ) , if @xmath3 is a connected graded nilpotent lie group with lie algebra grading @xmath90 , we define a left invariant subbundle of the tangent bundle , @xmath91 , by letting the fiber at a point be the left translate of the subspace @xmath92 . in the rest of the paper , we will , by abuse of notation , refer to the subbundle and the fiber by @xmath91 .",
    "if we place a norm @xmath93 on each fiber of @xmath91 , we define the carnot - carathodory distance between @xmath94 by @xmath95 if no such paths exist , we set @xmath96 .",
    "we call a path whose tangent is in the subbundle @xmath91 at each point a horizontal path . note that @xmath97 defines a left invariant metric on @xmath3 .",
    "in general , if @xmath98 is merely a norm , we call the quadruple @xmath99 a carnot - carathodory group or a sub - finsler group ( if we wish to emphasize that @xmath93 is only a norm ) and @xmath97 a carnot - carathodory or sub - finsler metric . if @xmath93 arises from an inner product , @xmath100 , on @xmath91 , we denote the resulting space by @xmath101 and we call it a sub - riemannian group",
    ". this nomenclature and notation is somewhat different from the literature which often interchanges the terms carnot - carathodory metric , sub - riemannian metric , and singular riemannian metric freely . in this exposition ,",
    "any object adorned with a `` cc '' will be constructed to be with respect to @xmath97 .",
    "for example , @xmath102 is the @xmath97-ball of radius @xmath103 with center @xmath104 .",
    "it is a consequence of chow s theorem ( @xcite or see @xcite for a exhaustive discussion of this fact ) that any two points in @xmath105 can be connected with a smooth horizontal path .",
    "this leaves open the question of geodesics in carnot - carathodory spaces .",
    "we call a segment a geodesic if it is a local length minimizer .",
    "again , in the literature , there are many different terms / meanings for geodesic paths and/or length minimizing paths depending on whether the geodesics satisfy certain differential equations ( see , for example , @xcite and @xcite ) . for this exposition ,",
    "these issues are not relevant and hence we will use the simplified language . in a sub - riemannian group @xmath101 , there is a nice class of geodesics which will be useful in later sections .",
    "let @xmath101 be a left invariant sub - riemannian metric where @xmath3 is a connected graded nilpotent lie group and fix @xmath79 , @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath107 be a smooth left invariant vector field on @xmath3 with @xmath108 .",
    "let @xmath109 be an integral curve of @xmath107 such that @xmath110 .",
    "we call @xmath109 a radial geodesic eminating from @xmath34 .",
    "if a basepoint is understood , we shall simply call @xmath109 a radial geodesic .    note that radial geodesics are actually geodesics of @xmath97 . indeed , considering the quotient",
    "@xmath111 $ ] endowed with the left invariant metric induced by the @xmath112 inner product on @xmath91 , the quotient map @xmath113 $ ] is @xmath58-lipschitz and takes radial `` geodesics '' to geodesics in the quotient and preserves their length .",
    "thus , these are geodesics of @xmath97 as well .",
    "in addition , we see that @xmath78 is a homothety of @xmath97 . since @xmath78 is an automorphism of @xmath3 and @xmath87 preserves @xmath91 and acts as a homothety on @xmath91 , we see that @xmath78 is a homothety on @xmath114 .    in @xcite",
    ", mitchell describes the local structure of more general carnot - carathodory spaces .",
    "if @xmath101 is a sub - riemannian group , the local structure is much easier to determine given the existence of a left invariant metric , a homothety of that metric , and the uniqueness of the haar measure .",
    "the following results can either be thought of as mitchell s results in this special case or as consequences the extra structure in this special case .",
    "[ mitchell ] let @xmath101 be a sub - riemannian group . then ,    1 .   for any @xmath79 , the tangent cone at @xmath34 , @xmath115 exists , is unique , and is isometric to @xmath114 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath116 .",
    "then @xmath117 is the hausdorff dimension of @xmath114 .",
    "3 .   let @xmath118 be a riemannian completion of the inner product @xmath100 on all of @xmath64 such that the grading is orthogonal .",
    "let `` dvol '' denote the riemannian volume measure associated to this left invariant riemannian metric . then",
    ", if @xmath119 denotes the @xmath117 dimensional hausdorff measure , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are commensurable .",
    "in other words , there exist constants @xmath121 such that @xmath122    one should note that in mitchell s work on more general carnot - carathodory spaces , the constants @xmath121 must be recalculated depending on a choice of compact set and and the the hausdorff and riemannian measures are only commensurable on compact sets .",
    "however , we now see that in our setting , the left invariance of the metric and the presence of a homothety allows us have global constants for the volume and hausdorff measure comparisons .",
    "first , we start with an illustrative example :    _ example : _ let @xmath123 denote the three dimensional heisenberg group with a left - invariant sub - riemannian metric .",
    "it is well known that the haar measure on @xmath123 is , in fact , the four dimensional hausdorff measure with respect to @xmath97 on @xmath123 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this confirms the formula from mitchell s theorem .",
    "indeed , @xmath124 in addition , we can quickly see the volume estimate inequality ( [ ccvrball ] ) using the homothety @xmath125 .",
    "consider what @xmath125 , with @xmath126 , does to the riemannian volume .",
    "denote by @xmath17 the riemannian metric given by the inner product @xmath118 described above . at the identity , the metric @xmath127 , written in terms of the left invariant vector fields @xmath128 and @xmath129 looks like @xmath130 thus , the riemannian volume element determined by the metric @xmath17",
    "is multiplied by @xmath131 under @xmath132 .",
    "thus , picking @xmath133 to work for a particular value of @xmath134 , we can then use the dilation @xmath125 to scale the picture so that the same constant works for any @xmath103 value larger than zero .",
    "this argument actually works for more general graded nilpotent lie groups yielding the same comparative scaling between the carnot - carathodory metric and the riemannian metric .    in the proof of the limited differentiability of bilipschitz maps , we will need to be able to manipulate covers of sets in graded nilpotent lie groups while using the measure @xmath119 .",
    "in particular , we want to be able to take the analogue of a vitali cover of a measurable set @xmath135 and find a countable disjoint subcover which still covers almost all of @xmath135 with respect to @xmath119 .",
