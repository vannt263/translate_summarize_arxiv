    "the weibel instability ( wi )  @xcite of plasmas with anisotropic velocity distribution is one of the most basic and long - studied collective plasma processes .",
    "for example , propagation of an electron beam through the background plasma is subject to strong wi  fried .",
    "there has been a significant revival in theoretical studies of the wi because it is viewed as highly relevant to at least two area of science : astrophysics of gamma - ray bursts and their afterglows  medv , medv1,gruz , spitk , mor1,milos and the fast ignitor  @xcite scenario of the inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) .",
    "specifically , generation of the upstream magnetic field during the grb aftershocks is considered necessary for explaining emission spectra of the afterglows as well as for generating and sustaining collisionless shocks responsible for particle acceleration during grbs .",
    "collisionless weibel instability is the likeliest mechanism  @xcite for producing such magnetic fields .",
    "the wi is likely to play an important role in the fast ignitor scenario  @xcite because it can result in the collective energy loss of a relativistic electron beam in both coronal and core plasma regions @xcite . because the relativistic electron beam has to travel through an enormous density gradient ( varying from @xmath0@xmath1 near the critical surface where the beam is produced to @xmath2@xmath1 in the dense core ) ,",
    "both collisionless and collisional wi manifest themselves along the beam s path .",
    "the dynamics and energetics of the nonlinear saturation and long - term behavior of the wi are important for both laboratory and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "for example , collisionless shock dynamics depends on the long - term evolution of the magnetic field energy .",
    "specifically , it is not clear whether the long - term magnetic fields generated during the coalescence of current filaments remain finite  @xcite or decay with time  @xcite ( and if they do , according to what physical mechanism ) .",
    "numerous numerical simulations  @xcite demonstrated that magnetic field energy grows during the earlier stages of the wi and starts decaying during the later ( strongly nonlinear ) stage .",
    "the reason for this decay has never been fully understood .",
    "one decay mechanism based on the merger of filaments bearing super - alfvenic current ( @xmath3  davbook , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electron charge and mass , respectively , and @xmath6 is the speed of light in vacuum ) during the late stage of the wi has been recently identified  @xcite . in the review",
    "@xcite we presented a detailed analysis of the high - current filaments current and density profiles and provide qualitative and quantitative explanation of the energetics of their merger in the limit ( @xmath7 ) . in that case",
    "the filaments carry super alfenic current and their perpendicular energy distribution is closely described by a rh distribution that is @xmath8 function of perpendicular kinetic energy , or kv distribution as it is called in accelerator physics .",
    "for such a distribution functions the density profile in the filament is flat and the radial electric field vanishes .",
    "particle - in - cell simulation of the nonlinear stages of the weibel instability showed significant ion acceleration in the radial electric field . * therefore , it is very important to investigate departure from rh or kv distribution during nonlinear stages of the weibel instability , which ultimately determines in acceleration in the micro field of the filammetns . *",
    "to that end we investigated propagation of the relativistic electron beam through a background plasma and development of the self - electric and magnetic field .",
    "of particular interest is a case when the beam transverse size is much larger than the electron skin depth by a factor of ten and more , @xmath9 .",
    "the filament resulting from the weibel instability are typically of the size of the electron skin depth , @xmath10 .",
    "here,@xmath11 , @xmath12 is the electron plasma frequency , and @xmath13 is the uniform background plasma density .",
    "therefore in the limit @xmath9 many , @xmath14 filaments are formed and then merge multiple times . in the process of merger there is an effective exchange in the perpendicular energy between beam particles and plasma electrons .",
    "if the beam density approaches the background plasma density , the beam electrons expel the plasma electrons and the beam electron space charge is neutralized by the background ions . in this case",
    "the further pinching of the beam is limited by the background plasma density . to avoid this limitation",
    ", we studied the very low density beam with the density a factor of 1000 less than the background plasma density .",
    "this insured that as beam filaments merge and the beam density dramatically increases the beam density still remains small compared with the plasma density . in this limiting case , common pic codes are not efficient for the description of the plasma electron due to the large numerical noise compared to the beam density .",
    "however , we can utilize a semi - analytic approach for description of the plasma electrons . because the beam evolution occur on a time scale much smaller than the electron plasma period",
    ", the electron background plasma adiabatically modifies to the beam current profile via the return current , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "we also assume charge neutrality of the system consisting of the beam electrons , ambient plasma electrons , and ambient plasma ions  @xcite .",
    "these simulations do not resolve the motion of the ambient plasma electrons and , therefore , can take computational time steps @xmath15 .",
    "after exclusion of fast motions of the plasma electrons , the beam particles are treated as macroparticles in pic algorithm .",
    "the logic behind the quasi - neutral code is that the full dynamics of the ambient plasma need not be simulated , and its density can be obtained from the quasi - neutrality condition : @xmath16therefore , ambient plasma is modelled as a passive fluid that responds to the evolving electron beam in order to maintain charge neutrality .",
    "electron beam particles are modelled using numerical macro - particles that are advanced in time by the self - consistently determined electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the leading magnetic field @xmath17 develops in the @xmath18 plane , where @xmath19 is the @xmath20-component of the vector potential .",
    "the inductive electric field associated with the time - varying flux @xmath19 is @xmath21",
    ". electric field also has a transverse component @xmath22 that is found from the quasi - static force balance of the ambient plasma electrons in the plane : @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the return flow of the ambient plasma .",
    "this quasi - equilibrium is the consequence of another observation from direct pic simulations : that the transverse velocity @xmath25 of the ambient plasma electrons is considerably smaller than the beam s average transverse speed @xmath26 and plasma s longitudinal velocity @xmath27 .",
    "one of the consequences of that is that the dominant magnetic field is the transverse one  @xcite , i.  e. that the out - of - plane magnetic field is small : @xmath28 .",
    "to summarize , these are the dominant electric and magnetic fields of the quasi - neutral beam - plasma system : @xmath29    for collisionless plasma , two important conservation laws simplify the description of the plasma motion : conservation of the canonical momentum in the @xmath20-direction and the conservation of the generalized vorticity  buneman_52,kaganovich_pop01,us .",
