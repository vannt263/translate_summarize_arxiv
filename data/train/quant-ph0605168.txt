    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite is a technique that can be used to eliminate the fluorescence from an atom illuminated with light whose frequency is equal to a particular atomic transition .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in systems of three - level atoms in @xmath0 configuration ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : atomo ] ) @xcite . in this configuration",
    "a mode of the field , called the pump field , interacts resonantly with one dipole transition , while another mode , the probe field , interacting with the second dipole transition , is tested for transparency .",
    "the maximum absorption of the probe field by the medium depends on the rabi frequencies associated with each atomic optical transition .",
    "the maximum occurs for a detuning from resonance which increases monotonically with the rabi frequencies .",
    "eit has many applications such as ultra slow propagation @xcite and storage of light @xcite , to name just a few .",
    "in general , the mean value of the electromagnetic field after interacting with the medium is measured .",
    "we may wonder if the medium is also transparent to the field fluctuations of the initial incoming probe field , particularly if these fluctuations are due to an initial state of the field which does not have a classical analog , such as squeezed states . in order to further investigate this question",
    "it is necessary to treat the field quantum mechanically . under the assumption that the pump field is classical and with rabi frequency much larger than the associated rabi frequency of the probe field treated quantum mechanically , fleischhauer et.al.@xcite showed that the medium is transparent to the full quantum state .",
    "furthermore they showed that they can transfer the state of the probe field to the atoms and then back to the field again .",
    "these results were partially confirmed by the experimental work of akamatsu et.al.@xcite , where the transparency of the atoms was measured considering an initially squeezed vacuum state as a probe field .",
    "recent experimental @xcite @xcite @xcite studies have shown how the noise of the probe field is influenced by the medium of @xmath0 systems in a parameter region where the atoms show electromagnetically induced transparency . also theoretical work where the pump and probe fields are treated quantum mechanically @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite has recently been done .",
    "it turns out that when both modes , pump and probe , are in a coherent state , the medium is transparent for the initial fluctuations of the coherent state , except for expected fluorescence due to small absorption from the media when they are not in the totally ideal eit situation @xcite .",
    "moreover , the effects of the field noise , particularly quantum noise and its influence on the atoms state has been investigated .",
    "dantan et.al.@xcite @xcite have shown that an initially squeezed vacuum as a probe field can be transferred to the atomic ensemble .",
    "the situation where the rabi frequency of the pump and probe field are comparable and the probe field is in a general squeezed state still lacks a complete theoretical treatment .",
    "atom in @xmath0 configuration , @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent radiative decaying constants.,width=288 ]    in this paper we study the statistical properties of the electromagnetic quadrature functions of the stationary output field from a two mode cavity filled with three - level atoms in @xmath0 configuration . in particular we investigate the case when the two modes of the cavity field are in resonance with the dipole transitions of the three - level atoms and the corresponding interaction constants and decay rates are equal . for this case ,",
    "when the mean value of the pump field is not zero the atoms show eit and the average values of the field do not change during the interaction .",
    "we focus on the case where the input probe field does not have a classical analog , namely when it is in a squeezed state .",
    "the most interesting feature of the results for the quadrature noise spectrum is that , for a given frequency , close to the transition frequency of the atoms associated to the probe field , we have a maximum of absorption of the initial squeezing of the probe field .",
    "remarkably , some of this initial squeezing of the probe field can be transferred to the pump field .",
    "this transfer is maximized when both rabi frequencies are equal .",
    "the spectrum frequency where this transfer happens is very close to the resonance frequency of the probe field with the atom .",
    "our results imply that the initial quantum properties of the fields are modified after interacting with the medium showing eit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sc : equation ] we give a brief review on how the system equations are obtained and solved . in section  [ sc : analysis ] we present the main new results , which consist of analytical expressions for the spectrum of the quadrature noise of the field after interacting with the medium when the rabi frequency associated with each field is different from zero .",
