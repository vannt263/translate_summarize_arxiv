    "mass clustered around galaxies distorts the local space - time , bending light rays which pass near them and inducing distortions in the images of more distant galaxies .",
    "observation of these distortions enables weak lensing measurements of the projected - mass correlation function ( pmcf : @xcite ) .",
    "recent measurements of the pmcf in fields drawn from the las campanas redshift survey @xcite and the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite : hereafter m02 ) reveal an approximately linear correlation between the luminosity of l @xmath2 l@xmath3 galaxies and the depth of the dark matter potential wells in which they reside .",
    "this close connection is not particularly surprising in a modern picture of galaxy formation @xcite , though it requires rather uniform integrated star formation efficiency across halos of a range of masses .",
    "the weak lensing effects induced by galaxies are very small ; peak distortions of background galaxies in the sdss are only 0.5% . in addition , quantitative interpretation of the lensing results requires an accurate understanding of lens geometries .",
    "it is important to quantitatively confirm these lensing results by independent methods .    in this work",
    "we briefly examine galaxy mass - to - light scalings with an independent dynamical method .",
    "we extract a sample of ` host ' galaxies surrounded by systems of ` satellites ' from data collected by the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "host galaxies typically have few satellites , making it impractical to measure their masses individually . by combining satellites from many hosts of similar luminosity",
    ", we measure the mean velocity field around the hosts .",
    "the method is analogous to the ` stacking ' of galaxies used in lensing measurements of the pmcf .",
    "it is closely related to the satellite galaxy analyses of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "data for this study are drawn from sloan digital sky survey : a combined imaging and spectroscopic survey of 10@xmath4 deg@xmath5 in the north galactic cap , and a smaller , deeper region in the south .",
    "the imaging survey is carried out in drift - scan mode in five sdss filters ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) to a limiting magnitude of r@xmath1122.5 @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic survey targets a ` main ' sample of galaxies with @xmath8@xmath1117.8 and a median redshift of z@xmath120.1 @xcite .",
    "velocity errors in the redshift survey are @xmath1230 km / s . for more details of the sdss",
    "see @xcite and @xcite . for this study",
    "we extract from the sdss main galaxy sample a catalog of 102,922 galaxies with accurately measured redshifts in a range from z=0.01 to z=0.2 .",
    "potential host galaxies must pass an isolation cut : they must be at least two times more luminous than any galaxy within a projected distance of 2 @xmath0mpc and a velocity window of @xmath131000 km / s . around each such host",
    ", we select as possible satellites all galaxies at least four times fainter than the host ( 1.5 magnitudes ) , within a projected distance of 500 @xmath0kpc , and within a velocity window of @xmath131000 km / s . combining the requirement of faint satellites with the magnitude limit of the sdss spectroscopic survey limits our host galaxies to @xmath8@xmath11 16.3 .",
    "there are 13,737 galaxies with @xmath8@xmath1116.3 in the sample . of these",
    ", 618 are both isolated and have at least one faint satellite .",
    "most of the remainder fail the isolation cut .",
    "the total number of satellites is 1225 .",
    "while the mean number of satellites around each host is only two , there are host galaxies with as many as 19 satellites .",
    "an object with this many satellites is clearly more a group with a dominant central galaxy than a galaxy with a few satellites .",
    "we remove these by requiring that the combined luminosity of the satellites be less than the luminosity of the host .",
    "all but 5 of the host systems pass this cut .",
    "absolute magnitude distributions of host and satellite galaxies are shown in figure [ basicinfo ] .",
    "many still fainter satellites exist ; we are prevented from identifying them by the magnitude limit of the sdss spectroscopic survey .    to reveal the mix of host galaxy types , we divide galaxies into early ( redder ) and late ( bluer ) types using @xmath6-@xmath8  color as described in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6-@xmath8  distribution for host and satellite galaxies is shown in the lower right panel of figure [ basicinfo ] .",
    "overall the host galaxies are 75% early and 25% late types .",
    "it is important to stress that this division of early and late is luminosity dependent in a way which is strongly color dependent . in @xmath6 ,",
    "late types consitute 25% of galaxies at all luminosities , while in @xmath10 , late types are @xmath2 50% of low luminosity galaxies , and @xmath11 5% of high luminosity galaxies .",
    "this variation in the morphological mix with luminosity complicates comparison of these results to the m02 lensing results in the bluer bands , where early and late type galaxies have substantially different mass - to - light ratios .",
    "to examine the relationship between satellite dynamics and host galaxy luminosity , we bin systems by host luminosity , then examine the host - satellite velocity difference histograms for each luminosity bin .",
    "all luminosities are based on sdss petrosian magnitudes , k - corrected in the manner described in @xcite .",
    "an increase in the dispersion of satellite motions with host luminosity is clearly detected .",
    "we quantify this variation by fitting the velocity difference histogram in each luminosity bin to the sum of a gaussian plus a constant , where the constant term represents the contribution due to random interlopers not physically associated with the host galaxy .",
    "the gaussian widths fit to these distributions ( @xmath14 ) are direct measures of the velocity dispersion characteristic of satellites for host galaxies in each luminosity bin . while models of satellite motions @xcite suggest that the line of sight velocity dispersion of satellites may be non - gaussian , our measured profiles are well fit by these models .",
    "errors quoted for these gaussian fits include the degeneracy between peak height and width .",
    "to compare these results to the weak lensing results of m02 , we need to determine model masses for each luminosity bin .",
    "the m02 lensing results quantify mass - to - light scalings by measuring @xmath15 ; the mass inferred by fitting a singular isothermal sphere model to the observed density contrast within a radius of 260 @xmath0kpc .",
    "we calculate here a very similar parameter , @xmath1 .    to derive this parameter we adopt a jeans approach .",
    "this approach is unlikely to represent the situation in detail , as the dynamical times for satellites at projected separations of 500 @xmath0kpc approach the hubble time .",
    "we address this concern briefly by reference to n - body simulations in the following section .",
    "we begin with the relation @xcite : @xmath16 where r is the radius at which we measure the mass , @xmath17 is the average radial velocity of satellites squared , @xmath18 is the number density of satellites as a function of radius , and @xmath19 is the velocity anisotropy @xmath20 by measuring the projected number density of satellites as a function of radius we determine @xmath21 .",
    "measurements of @xmath14 in apertures from 100 to 500 @xmath0kpc show no significant variation , implying that the second term in the parentheses of equation [ bt4 - 55 ] is zero .",
    "we assume that the velocity anisotropy @xmath19=0 .",
    "if this is incorrect , the masses determined here will be biased by a factor of @xmath12(1.0 - @xmath19 ) .",
    "finally , we assume that our measured @xmath22 , the mean square line of site velocity of all satellites within a projected distance of 500 @xmath0kpc of the host , is equal to @xmath17 .",
    "these are significant assumptions , which we test below by simulation .    with these assumptions",
    ", our mass estimator reduces to the simple form : @xmath23 where r is the 260 @xmath0kpc radius to which we integrate the mass , and @xmath17 is the one dimensional rms satellite velocity .",
    "a variety of assumptions were made to arrive at equation [ m260_def ] .",
    "it is possible that one or more of these assumptions introduces systematic error . in addition , it is desirable to relate the mass esimator @xmath1  to theoretically favored quantities like @xmath24 . as a first test , we conduct a parallel analysis within a simulated universe , extracting the observables used in our analysis from the simulation . by reconstructing masses in the simulation using @xmath1 , and comparing these to @xmath24 , it is possible to both test the validity of @xmath1 and understand its relationship to @xmath24 .    to conduct this test we turn to the gif simulations of @xcite .",
    "gif combines n - body simulations of the evolution of dark matter clustering with a semianalytic galaxy modeling scheme , including gas cooling , star formation , feedback from supernovae , and galaxy merging .",
    "the end result is a catalog of galaxies with b , v , r , i , and k magnitudes and stellar masses .",
    "peculiar velocities for each galaxy are determined from the n - body simulations . as a result , these velocities have the full structure we might expect to find in the data .",
    "the most important limitation of the gif simulations for this comparison is their relatively low mass resolution .",
    "they resolve only the most massive and luminous host galaxies .    to test our analysis of sdss satellite motions , we conduct a parallel analysis within the gif simulations . we define as isolated all galaxies which are at least two times brighter than any other galaxy within their halo .",
    "we then search these for cases with satellites at least four times fainter .",
    "we use the velocity differences between hosts and satellites to populate velocity difference histograms , and sort these by host luminosity , in the same manner used in the sdss satellite study . as a first check of equation [ m260_def ] , we use the simulations to check our assumptions about @xmath19 and the relationship between @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "we calculate the velocity anisotropy from the simulation , and find @xmath27 .",
    "we also find the los velocity dispersion @xmath28 .",
    "while the gif simulations are not a perfect match to our satellite sample , this provides some support for the assumptions we made in deriving equation [ m260_def ] .",
    "a more direct approach is to confirm that the data and simulations show a consistent relationship between the observables : @xmath29 and luminosity .",
    "this comparison of the sdss and gif @xmath29 vs. luminosity measurements is shown in figure [ sdss_gif_comparison ] .",
    "the sdss luminosity measurements are in @xmath9 , and the gif luminosities in johnson i , but as both are converted to solar luminosities the comparison remains appropriate .",
    "both the sdss and gif results are consistent with a simple model in which @xmath30",
    ".    since the gif simulations provide values for the @xmath24  associated with each halo , we can compare measures of @xmath1  derived from galaxy velocities to @xmath24  within the simulations .",
    "this comparison suggests that @xmath1@xmath31@xmath24 .",
    "it is essential to note that this relation is determined only for the most luminous galaxies , and over only a factor of four in luminosity .",
    "while this comparison is limited , it provides some confidence that equation [ m260_def ] sensibly relates satellite velocities to masses .",
    "a more detailed understanding awaits simulations with higher mass resolution , in which more direct comparisons can be made .",
    "the measurements of @xmath1  derived from satellite motions are shown in figure [ mass_comparison ] .",
    "the relationship between @xmath1  and light in each passband is well fit by a single power law .",
    "as observed in m02 , these relations are consistent with a power law index of one ( constant @xmath32 ) in all bands except @xmath6 , where a flatter relation , with a best fit power law index @xmath120.6 is observed .",
    "to compare these results to the m02 lensing results , we fix the power law index to one , and fit the @xmath1  vs. luminosity data in each band to obtain values for @xmath32 .",
    "values for these @xmath32  ratios are given in figure [ mass_comparison ] .",
    "the dynamical @xmath32  values are consistent with the lensing values at the 1@xmath33 level in most bands .",
    "they differ most strongly in u and g , where m02 suggests results will be very sensitive to the mix of host types .",
    "the masses of l@xmath3 galaxy halos are proportional to light , and @xmath32   values vary strongly with color",
    ". more detailed quantitative comparison of the lensing and dynamical results will only be possible when we can measure more identical samples of hosts and lenses .",
    "this is difficult .",
    "the magnitude limit of the sdss spectroscopy biases dynamical studies toward hosts at z@xmath110.05 , while lens geometries prefer lenses at z@xmath120.15 .",
    "still , the @xmath32  values derived by independent methods agree reasonably , especially in the redder bands , where differences between the host and lens samples are probably less important .",
    "recent sdss weak lensing results ( m02 ) revealed a linear relation between galaxy luminosity and mass on halo scales . to quantitatively test this result ,",
    "we have measured the relationship between galaxy luminosity and satellite dynamics for a large sample of reasonably isolated host galaxies .",
    "we observe a highly significant increase in satellite velocity with host luminosity .    to make direct comparisons to the weak lensing results",
    ", we apply a simple mass estimator , @xmath1 , which is closely analogous to the mass modeling used in m02 .",
    "a first order test of the validity of this model is made by computing it within the gif simulations .",
    "the relationship seen here between @xmath1  and luminosity matches reasonably the relation seen by entirely independent weak lensing methods .",
    "this confirms the essential conclusions reached in m02 .",
    "the luminous and dark components of l@xmath3 galaxies are strongly coupled on @xmath12200 kpc scales .",
    "it is unknown whether the scaling relations observed here for super - l@xmath3  galaxies apply at lower luminosity .",
    "perhaps the most important future extension of these studies will be to less luminous galaxies .",
    "additional comparison of lensing and dynamical mass estimates will require measurement of more closely related host and lens samples , and more detailed study of the extraction of mass from the observable pmcf and satellite velocity structure .",
