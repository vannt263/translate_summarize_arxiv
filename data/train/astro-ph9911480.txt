    "the quest for high  redshift ( @xmath2 ) clusters of galaxies has recently received a lot of well deserved attention .",
    "the physical mechanisms that rule galactic evolution still lack a clear understanding , and clusters at different redshifts are privileged observational targets to develop related studies . moreover , knowing the number density of these systems , as well as their epoch of formation , provides crucial ways of testing different theoretical cosmological models put forward in the literature ( see _ eg _ bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ) .",
    "however , finding clusters at cosmologically interesting look - back times ( @xmath3 ) , not to mention defining a complete sample , is a time consuming and difficult task .",
    "successful attempts to gather optically selected samples were made by postman et al ( 1996 ; p96 onwards ) in the northern hemisphere .",
    "prompted by the release of the eis data , we developed an algorithm - see lazzati et al ( 1998 ) , lobo et al ( 1998 ) - to be applied to catalogues of galaxy positions and magnitudes .",
    "one of its main advantages is that the spatial and luminosity part of the filter are run separately on the catalogue , with no assumption on the typical size or typical @xmath4 for clusters , as these parameters intervene in our algorithm only as typical angular scale - a set of gaussian @xmath5 s - and typical apparent magnitude @xmath6 . in this way",
    ", the significance of a cluster detection is always enhanced , by combining the most probable @xmath6 with the most probable angular size . moreover ,",
    "a local background is also used , allowing us to adapt well to and overcome the hazards of inhomogeneous data sets ( the quality of eis patch a data was somewhat affected by el ni~ no ) .",
    "extensive simulations using directly the eis data allowed us to obtain completeness and contamination rates that do seem advantageous relatively to the respective ones obtained with the p96 algorithm ( see the next section ) .",
    "running our new algorithm on the eis data produced a new `` robust '' set of cluster candidates up to @xmath1 ( as estimated _ via _ the respective @xmath6 ) , namely @xmath7 for patch a ( @xmath8 sq .",
    "degs . ) and @xmath9 for patch b ( @xmath10 sq . degs . ) . out of these ,",
    "nearly half are not present in the list of candidates obtained from the same data using the p96 algorithm ( olsen et al 1999 ; see lobo et al 1998 ) .",
    "the false detection rate we estimated is of @xmath11 spurious candidates per square degree once the threshold is set at @xmath12 ( our final adopted detection threshold ) . for comparison ,",
    "p96 report an estimated contamination rate for their final catalogue of at most @xmath13 in their @xmath14 square degree area . as for completeness",
    ", setting the detection threshold at @xmath12 still allows us to achieve a completeness of @xmath15 until @xmath16 for richness 2 , coma - like clusters .",
    "some of our cluster candidates have already been followed - up in multi - waveband bvri imaging to estimate photometric redshifts and to get a handle on cluster members and determine their color properties .",
    "+ the complete list of candidates , finding charts and further details will be presented in lobo et al ( 1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "three of our highest estimated redshift ( @xmath17 ) cluster candidates were selected for spectroscopic observations carried out with the fors / vlt last september .",
    "the data we obtained ( aimed at reaching down to @xmath18 , and as far as the cluster virial radius ) allowed us to confirm their `` cluster identity '' and to secure their redshifts as being @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively . once these data are completed , they will form a small but homogeneous sample of clusters of very similar richness and redshift , that can be used to provide us with the absolute normalization of the bright end of the luminosity function in high@xmath22 clusters , an important constraint for theories of structure formation and evolution .",
    "we will also explore the dynamics and morphological evolution of member galaxies at a redshift associated to the assembling of large galaxy clusters .",
