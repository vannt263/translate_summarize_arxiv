    "many hierarchical growth scenarios for galaxies have invoked co - evolution and symbiotic feedback between galaxies and their central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to explain ( 1 ) the tight relation between host galaxy spheroid and smbh masses @xcite , ( 2 ) the stark contrast between predicted and observed galaxy luminosity functions @xcite , and ( 3 ) the crude similarity between the global star formation and smbh accretion rate histories over cosmic time @xcite . in particular , it is now believed that strong feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) plays a significant role in galaxy evolution , abruptly quenching star formation to produce the `` red and dead '' massive galaxies that we see today @xcite , and polluting the intergalactic and intracluster media with metals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "evidence for such feedback has been steadily growing over the years ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , detections of moderate - to - high velocity ionised outflows ( 1001000 km s@xmath2 ) have now been reported both as spatially resolved and kinematically distinct emission lines from ionisation regions or in absorption along the line - of - sight toward numerous qsos and seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these studies have directly shown that agns can produce such feedback , and even hinted that the degree of feedback may scale with smbh mass and accretion power .",
    "nonetheless , many questions still remain about the underlying physics by which agn - driven energy and momentum might be transferred to the interstellar medium and molecular clouds ultimately responsible for star formation .",
    "a number of recent studies have provided observational evidence that neutral and molecular gas outflows also appear to be common in both agns and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( hereafter ulirgs ) .",
    "@xcite was among the first to spatially resolve and map the outflow within the closest powerful ulirg mrk 231 .",
    "@xcite later detected strongly blueshifted ( @xmath4 km s@xmath2 ) optical nai d @xmath55890 , 5896 in absorption at @xmath6kpc from mrk 231 s nucleus , and @xcite used keck / osiris adaptive optics observations to improve the spatial resolution of mrk 231 s previously observed outflow by a factor @xmath7 , measuring a terminal velocity of @xmath8 kms@xmath2 .",
    "concurrently , @xcite discovered a @xmath11000 km s@xmath2 molecular outflow in mrk  231 as traced by _",
    "herschel _ far - infrared ( fir ) observations of oh in absorption , while @xcite detected spatially resolved co emission in a @xmath1  @xmath9  km  s@xmath2 outflow using the iram / pdb interferometer . remarkably , the outflow mass rate estimated from oh and co observations were in agreement within uncertainties ( in the range 7001000  m@xmath10  yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "this estimate is significantly larger than the star formation rate ( hereafter sfr ) of @xmath11  m@xmath10  yr@xmath2 found in the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "based on the energy requirements and the fact that the outflows appear to arise largely from the nucleus and not from nearby star forming regions , an agn origin is generally favored in mrk  231 .    more generally , @xcite reported the detection of massive molecular outflows traced by oh in several additional ulirgs , suggesting that the agn luminosity and the agn contribution to the total infrared luminosity seem to be correlated with the outflow terminal velocities and anti - correlated with the gas depletion timescales .",
    "it is important to remark that oh lines are often associated with molecular h@xmath12 clouds that are somewhat perturbed from equilibrium .",
    "more recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter v13 ) presented a detailed study of a sample of 43 ulirgs and qsos at @xmath13 which were observed with _",
    "herschel _ using the oh doublet at 119  @xmath0 m to characterise their molecular outflows .",
    "v13 found that the molecular outflows in these systems do not show any obvious dependence on sfr , although they warn that the range of sfrs probed by their sample is relatively narrow ( @xmath14 dex ) .",
    "furthermore , v13 found that ulirgs with large agn fractions and luminosities show oh features that are more blueshifted , particularly for objects with @xmath15 .",
    "finally , @xcite found that 15 out of 24 ulirgs with @xmath16 showed evidence for molecular outflows in the 79 and 119  @xmath0 m oh doublets , with velocities @xmath17 km s@xmath2 , implying that agns were likely necessary to power these high speed outflows .",
    "notably , none of these works included the most powerful luminous infrared galaxies , so - called hyper - luminous infrared galaxies ( hereafter hlirgs ) .",
    "hlirgs are beacons pinpointing the extremes of both star formation and perhaps agn accretion , and thus could provide clues about how the processes at work might scale with agn power and star formation rate .",
    "furthermore , while such systems relatively rare at low redshift , ulirgs and hlirgs are perhaps 100 times more common at high - z @xcite , potentially providing more relevant contributions to the star formation and accretion densities at these epochs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and serving as the likely progenitors for modern - day massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this work we analyse , for the first time , a sample of five hlirgs in order to constrain their molecular outflows .",
    "we observed the rest - frame 118121  @xmath0 m spectral region for each of these hlirgs with _",
    "herschel _ to detect the molecular oh doublet at 119  @xmath0 m in emission or absorption and measure its outflow velocity .",
    "we found that three out of five hlirgs present the oh doublet feature and only one of them shows unambiguous signatures consistent with a molecular outflow . in section",
    "[ sec : sample ] , we describe the galaxy sample . in section  [ sec : obs ]",
    "we outline the reduction and analysis of the observations .",
    "we present the results of this study in section  [ sec : results ] and interpreted them in section  [ sec : discussion ] . finally , we summarise our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . in this work ,",
    "we adopt @xmath18  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 , @xmath19 = 0.3 , and @xmath20 = 0.7 .",
    "we also adopt the standard convention that approaching material has a negative velocity with respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy due to doppler shift .",
    "our sample was selected from a parent sample studied by @xcite which contains 14 hlirgs . from this sample",
    ", we took 4 relatively local galaxies ( @xmath21 ) with very high ir luminosities ( @xmath22 ) to build a subsample of very bright sources ( @xmath23  jy ) in order to perform high signal - to - noise ratio _",
    "observations in a reasonable amount of observational time .",
    "all galaxies in the sample are late - stage mergers with several lines of evidence indicating that these objects host powerful agns .",
    "furthermore , we added another galaxy previously observed with _",
    "herschel _ and that satisfies the same selection criteria ( see section  [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "previously measured galaxy properties are summarised in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "we initially adopted redshift measurements from the literature , but found that some published values lacked associated errors and were considered less reliable . to remedy this ,",
    "we obtained redshifts from new spectroscopic observations for two galaxies in our sample , which we adopt below and provide in table  [ tab : sample ] ; reduction details are presented in appendix  [ ap ] .

    "the limits appeared in absorption and emission , such that we can only constrain the absolute value of the ew in the spectra with no detection of the oh doublet .",
    "we have analysed the _ herschel_/pacs spectrum of five hlirgs , using the oh119  @xmath0 m doublet to search for molecular outflows .",
    "the oh doublet was detected in three out of five galaxies , from which one was purely in emission and two purely in absorption .",
    "although it is possible that the oh detection in emission may indicate the presence of an outflow , the lack of a clear absorption component in the doublet does not allow us to conclude it with certainty .",
    "on the other hand , out of the two systems with oh detections in absorption only iras  f001837111 seems to have a molecular outflow . the most blueshifted wing of its oh profile reached about 1500  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "our analysis supports the lack of correlation between the oh equivalent width and both agn fraction and luminosity reported by v13 .",
    "furthermore , it agrees very well with the correlation between the oh equivalent width and the system obscuration also found by v13 .",
    "the characteristic velocities of the outflow detected in iras  f001837111 are in general agreement with previously studied correlations found in studies of local ulirgs , specifically v13 and @xcite .",
    "this fact supports the idea that outflows are not related either to starburst activity or stellar mass .",
    "instead , they support the notion that agns are responsible for driving the powerful outflows seen in many ulirgs / hlirgs .    a larger sample of hlirgs is clearly needed to explore these phenomena in more detail .",
    "we note that the wise all - sky catalog is already discovering large numbers of new hlirgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some fraction of these may lie at suitable redshifts whereby ground - based submillimeter facilities such as alma can probe any potential molecular outflows from them .",
    "otherwise , progress may have to wait for a still to be defined future far - infrared space observatory .",
