    "entanglement is the quantum correlation exhibiting nonlocal ( nonseparable ) properties .",

    "in particular , entanglement in _",
    "multi_-parties is of fundamental interest in quantum many - body theory @xcite , and makes quantum information processing ( qip ) , e.g. , distillation protocol , more efficient than that relying on entanglement only in _",
    "two_-parties @xcite . here , we classify and characterize the multipartite entanglement which has yet to be understood , compared with the bipartite one .    for the single copy of bipartite pure states on @xmath3 ,",
    "we are interested in whether a state @xmath4 can convert to another state @xmath5 by locc .",
    "it is convenient to consider the schmidt decomposition , @xmath6 where the computational basis @xmath7 is transformed to a local biorthonormal basis @xmath8 , and the schmidt coefficients @xmath9 can be taken as @xmath10 .",
    "we call the number of nonzero @xmath11 the ( schmidt ) local rank @xmath12",
    ". then the locc convertibility is given by a majorization rule between the coefficients @xmath9 of @xmath4 and those of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the structure of entangled states consists of partially ordered , continuous classes labeled by a set of @xmath9 . in particular , @xmath4 and @xmath5 belong to the same class under the locc classification if and only if all continuous @xmath9 coincide .",
    "suppose we are concerned with a coarse grained classification by the so - called stochastic locc ( slocc ) @xcite , where we identify @xmath4 and @xmath5 that are interconvertible back and forth with ( maybe different ) nonvanishing probabilities .",
    "this is because @xmath4 and @xmath5 are supposed to perform the same tasks in qip although their probabilities of success differ .",
    "later , we find that this slocc classification is still fine grained to classify the multipartite entanglement .",
    "mathematically , two states belong to the same class under slocc if and only if they are converted by an _",
    "invertible _ local operation having a nonzero determinant @xcite .",
    "thus the slocc classification is equivalent to the classification of orbits of the natural action : direct product of general linear groups @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the local rank @xmath12 in eq.([eq : schmidt ] ) @xcite , equivalently the rank of @xmath14 , is found to be preserved under slocc .",
    "a set @xmath15 of states of the local rank @xmath16 is a _ closed _ subvariety under slocc and @xmath17 is the singular locus of @xmath15 .",
    "this is how the local rank leads to an `` onion '' structure ( mathematically the stratification ) : @xmath18 and @xmath19 give @xmath20 classes of entangled states .",
    "since the local rank can decrease by _ noninvertible _ local operations , i.e. , general locc @xcite , these classes are totally ordered such that , in particular , the outermost generic set @xmath21 is the class of maximally entangled states and the innermost set @xmath22 is that of separable states .    for the single copy of multipartite pure states ,",
    "@xmath23 there are difficulties in extending the schmidt decomposition for a multiorthonormal basis @xcite . moreover , an attempt to use the tensor rank of @xmath24 @xcite falls down since @xmath15 , defined by it , is not always closed @xcite . in the 3 qubits , dr _ et al .",
    "_ showed that slocc classifies the whole states @xmath25 into _ finite _ classes and in particular there exist two inequivalent , greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) and w , classes of the tripartite entanglement @xcite .",

    ", we classify multipartite entanglement in a unified manner based on the hyperdeterminant .",
    "the advantages are three - fold .",
    "( i ) this classification is equivalent to the slocc classification when slocc has finitely many orbits .",
    "so it naturally includes the widely known bipartite and @xmath1-qubit cases .",
    "( ii ) in the multipartite case , we need further slocc invariants in addition to the local ranks . for example , in the @xmath1-qubit case @xcite , the @xmath1-tangle @xmath28 , just the absolute value of the hyperdeterminant ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) ) , is utilized to distinguish ghz and w classes .",
    "this work clarifies why the @xmath1-tangle @xmath28 appears and how these slocc invariants are related to the hyperdeterminant in general .",
    "( iii ) our classification is also useful to multipartite mixed states .",
    "a mixed state @xmath29 can be decomposed as a convex combination of projectors onto pure states .",
    "considering how @xmath29 needs at least the outer class in the onion structure of pure states , we can also classify multipartite mixed states into the totally ordered classes ( for details , see appendix  [ sec : mixed ] ) .",
    "we concentrate on the pure states here .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , a duality between separable states and entangled states is introduced .",
    "we find that the hyperdeterminant , associated to this duality , and its singularities lead to the slocc - invariant onion - like structure of multipartite entanglement .",
    "the characteristics of the hyperdeterminant and its singularities are explained in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "classifications of multipartite entangled states are exemplified in sec .",
    "so as to reveal how they are ordered under slocc .",
    "finally , the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] .",
    "in this section , we find that there is a duality between the set of separable states and that of entangled states . this duality derives the hyperdeterminant our classification is based on .",
    "to introduce our idea , we first recall the geometry of pure states . in a complex ( finite ) @xmath20-dimensional hilbert space @xmath30 ,",
    "let @xmath4 be a ( not necessarily normalized ) vector given by @xmath20-tuple of complex amplitudes @xmath31 in a computational basis .",
    "the physical state in @xmath30 is a ray , an equivalence class of vectors up to an overall nonzero complex number .",
    "then the set of rays constitutes the complex projective space @xmath32 ( the projectivization of @xmath30 ) , and @xmath33 , considered up to a complex scalar multiple , gives homogeneous coordinates in @xmath32 .    for a composite system which consists of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , the whole hilbert space is the tensor product @xmath36 and",
    "the associated projective space is @xmath37 .",
    "a set @xmath38 of the separable states is the mere cartesian product @xmath39 , whose dimension @xmath40 is much smaller than that of the whole space @xmath25 , @xmath41 .",
    "this @xmath38 is a closed , smooth algebraic subvariety ( segre variety ) defined by the segre embedding into @xmath42 @xcite , @xmath43 denoting homogeneous coordinates in @xmath42 by @xmath44 , we find that the segre variety @xmath38 is given by the common zero locus of @xmath45 homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "note that this condition implies that all @xmath49 minors of `` matrix '' @xmath50 equal 0 ; i.e. , the rank of @xmath50 is 1 .",
    "thus we have @xmath51 , which agrees with the slocc classification by the local rank in the bipartite case .",
    "now consider the multipartite cartesian product @xmath52 in the segre embedding into @xmath53 . because this segre variety @xmath38 is the projectivization of a variety of the matrices @xmath54",
    ", it gives a set of the completely separable states in @xmath55 . by another segre embedding ,",
    "say @xmath56 , we also distinguish a set of separable states where only 1st and 2nd parties can be entangled , i.e. , when we regard 1st and 2nd parties as one party , an element of this set is completely separable for `` @xmath57 '' parties .",
    "this is how , also in the multipartite case , we can classify all kinds of _ separable _ states , typically lower dimensional sets . note that , in the multipartite case , this check for the separability is more strict than the check by local ranks @xcite .      we rather want to classify _ entangled _ states , typically higher dimensional complementary sets of separable states .",
    "our strategy is based on the duality in algebraic geometry ; a hyperplane in @xmath58 forms the point of a dual projective space @xmath59 , and conversely every point @xmath60 of @xmath58 is tied to a hyperplane @xmath61 in @xmath59 as the set of all hyperplanes in @xmath58 passing through @xmath60 .",
    "remarkably , the projective duality between projective subspaces , like the above example , can be extended to an involutive correspondence between irreducible algebraic subvarieties in @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "so we define a projectively dual ( irreducible ) variety @xmath62 as the closure of the set of all hyperplanes tangent to the segre variety @xmath38 .",
    "let us observe ( and see the reason later ) that , in the bipartite case seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the variety @xmath63 of the _ degenerate _",
    "@xmath64 matrices @xmath65 is projectively dual to the variety @xmath66 of the matrices @xmath67 . that is , @xmath63 is the dual variety @xmath68 . following an analogy with a 2-dimensional ( bipartite ) case ,",
    "an @xmath2-dimensional matrix @xmath69 is called _ degenerate _ if and only if it ( precisely , its projectivization ) lies in the projectively dual variety @xmath68 of the segre variety @xmath38 .",
    "in other words , identifying the space of @xmath2-dimensional matrices with its dual by means of the pairing , @xmath70 we see that @xmath71 is degenerate if and only if its orthogonal hyperplane @xmath72 is tangent to @xmath38 at some nonzero point @xmath73 .",
    "analytically , a set of equations , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , has at least a nontrivial solution @xmath77 of every @xmath78 , and then @xmath79 is called a critical point .",
    "the above condition is also equivalent to saying that the kernel @xmath80 of @xmath81 is not empty , where @xmath80 is the set of points @xmath82 such that , in every @xmath83 , @xmath84 for the _ arbitrary _ @xmath85 .    in the case of @xmath86 , the condition for eqs.([eq : critical ] )",
    "coincides with the usual notion of degeneracy and means that @xmath71 does not have the full rank .",
    "it shows that @xmath68 is nothing but @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , @xmath68 , defined by this condition , is of codimension 1 and is given by the ordinary determinant @xmath87 , if and only if @xmath71 is a square @xmath88 matrix .",
    "in the @xmath2-dimensional case , if @xmath68 is a hypersurface ( of codimension 1 ) , it is given by the zero locus of a unique ( up to sign ) irreducible homogeneous polynomial over @xmath89 of @xmath90 .",
    "this polynomial is the hyperdeterminant introduced by cayley and is denoted by @xmath91 . as usual , if @xmath68 is not a hypersurface , we set @xmath91 to be 1",
    ".    remember that , in the _ bipartite _ case , we classify the states @xmath92 as the generic entangled states , the states @xmath93 as the next generic entangled states , and so on .",
    "likewise , we aim to classify the _ multipartite _ entangled states into the onion structure by the dual variety @xmath68 ( @xmath94 ) , its singular locus @xmath95 and so on ( i.e. , by every closed subvariety ) , instead of the tensor rank @xcite .",
    "in order to classify multipartite entanglement into the slocc - invariant onion structure , we explore the dual variety @xmath68 ( zero hyperdeterminant ) and its singular locus in this section .",
    "we utilize the hyperdeterminant , the generalized determinant for higher dimensional matrices by gelfand _",
    "its absolute value is also known as an entanglement measure , the concurrence @xmath96 @xcite or 3-tangle @xmath28 @xcite for the 2 or 3-qubit pure case , respectively .",
    "@xmath97    the following useful facts are found in @xcite . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath98 .",
    "the @xmath2-dimensional hyperdeterminant @xmath91 of format @xmath99 exists , i.e. , @xmath68 is a hypersurface , if and only if a `` polygon inequality '' @xmath100 is satisfied . for @xmath86 , this condition",
    "is reduced to @xmath101 as desired , and @xmath91 coincides with @xmath102 .",
    "the matrix format is called boundary if @xmath103 and interior if @xmath104 .",
    "note that ( i ) the boundary format includes the `` bipartite cut '' between the 1st party and the others so that it is mathematically tractable .",
    "( ii ) the interior format includes the @xmath105-qubit case .",
    "we treat hereafter the format where the polygon inequality holds and @xmath68 is the largest closed subvariety , defined by the hypersurface @xmath106 .",
    "@xmath91 is relatively invariant ( invariant up to constant ) under the action of @xmath107 . in particular",
    ", interchanging two parallel slices ( submatrices with some fixed directions ) leaves @xmath91 invariant up to sign , and @xmath91 is a homogeneous polynomial in the entries of each slice . since it is ensured that @xmath68 , @xmath95 , and further singularities are invariant under slocc , our classification is equivalent to or coarser than the slocc classification .",
    "later , we see that the former and the latter correspond to the case where slocc gives finitely and infinitely many classes , respectively",
    ".      it would not be easy to calculate @xmath108 directly by its definition that eqs.([eq : critical ] ) have at least one solution .",
    "still , the schlfli s method enables us to construct @xmath109 of format @xmath110 ( @xmath2 qubits ) by induction on @xmath2 @xcite .    for @xmath86 , by definition @xmath111 .",
    "suppose @xmath112 , whose degree of homogeneity is @xmath113 , is given .",

    "gives @xmath121 with an extra factor @xmath122 .",

    "note that because for @xmath129 or @xmath1 , the extra factor @xmath122 is just a nonzero constant , @xmath130 for the 3 or 4 qubits is readily calculated , respectively .",
    "it would be instructive to check that @xmath131 in eq.([eq : tau ] ) is obtained in this way .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath132 , @xmath122 is the chow form ( related resultant ) of irreducible components of the singular locus @xmath95 .",
    "these are due to the fact that @xmath95 has codimension @xmath46 in @xmath25 for any format of the dimension @xmath105 except for the format @xmath133 ( @xmath1-qubit case ) , which was conjectured in @xcite and was proved in @xcite .",

    "we can `` degrade '' these tripartite entangled classes into the biseparable or completely separable classes by locc in a similar fashion to the @xmath1 qubits .",
    "we notice that 3 grades in the @xmath1-qubit case changed to 4 grades in the @xmath207 ( @xmath149-qutrit and @xmath46-qubit ) case .",
    "in general , the partially ordered structure becomes `` higher '' , as the system of each party becomes the higher dimensional one .",
    "we also see how the tensor rank @xcite is inadequate for the onion - like classification of slocc orbits .",
    "further in the @xmath0-qubit case , our classification works .",
    "the outermost class @xmath235 of generic @xmath2-partite entangled states is given by @xmath236 .",
    "in @xmath237 , @xmath238 of degree 24 is explicitly calculated by the schlfli s construction in sec .",
    "[ sec : schlafli ]",
    ". it would be suggestive to transform any generic @xmath239-partite state ( @xmath240 ) to the `` representative '' of the outermost class by invertible local operations , @xmath241 where the continuous complex coefficients @xmath242 should satisfy @xmath243 thus three complex parameters remain in the outermost class ( since we consider rays rather than normalized state vectors ) .",
    "this means that there are infinitely many same dimensional slocc orbits in the @xmath239 qubits , and the slocc orbits never locally convert to each other when their sets of the parameters are distinct .",
    "it is also the case for the @xmath244 qubits .",
    "note that , in @xmath245 , this outermost class @xmath246 corresponds to the family of generic states in verstraete _ et al .",
    "_ s classification of the @xmath239 qubits by a different approach ( generalizing the singular value decomposition in matrix analysis to complex orthogonal equivalence classes ) , and @xmath68 contains their other special families @xcite .",
    "the next outermost class is @xmath247 . in the @xmath239 qubits , @xmath95 is shown to consist of eight closed irreducible components of codimension 1 in @xmath68 ; @xmath248 , and six @xmath249 for @xmath250 @xcite .",
    "they neither contain nor are contained by each other .",
    "their intersections also give ( finitely ) many lower dimensional genuine @xmath239-partite entangled classes .",
    "since the @xmath239-partite entangled classes necessarily have the same local ranks @xmath251 , these classes are not interconvertible by noninvertible local operations ( i.e. , any locc ) . as typical examples , ghz ( the maximally entangled state in bell s inequalities @xcite ) , @xmath252 ( i.e. , @xmath253 and the others are @xmath254 ) is included in the intersection of @xmath255 and six @xmath249 , but is excluded from @xmath138 .",
    "in contrast , w , @xmath256 ( i.e. , @xmath257 and the others are @xmath254 ) is included in the intersection of @xmath138 and six @xmath249 but is excluded from @xmath255 .    in the @xmath258 qubits , @xmath95",
    "is shown to consist of just two closed irreducible components @xmath138 and @xmath255 @xcite .",
    "we find that ghz and w are contained not only in @xmath259 but in @xmath95 ; i.e. , they have nontrivial solutions in eqs.([eq : critical ] ) , satisfying the singular conditions .",
    "they correspond to different intersections of further singularities , similarly to the @xmath239 qubits .",
    "in other words , they are peculiar , living in the border dimensions between entangled states and separable ones ,    in brief , the dual variety @xmath68 and its singularities lead to the _ coarse _ onion - like classification of slocc orbits , when slocc gives infinitely many orbits .",
    "the partially ordered structure of multipartite pure entangled states becomes `` wider '' , as the number @xmath2 of parties increases .",
    "although many inequivalent @xmath2-partite entangled classes appear in the @xmath2 qubits , they never locally convert to each other , as observed in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the majority of the @xmath2-partite entangled states never convert to ghz ( or w ) by locc , and the opposite conversion is also not possible .",
    "this is a significant difference from the bipartite or @xmath1-qubit case , where almost any entangled state and the maximally entangled state ( ghz ) can convert to each other by locc with nonvanishing probabilities .",
    "we have presented the onion - like classification of multipartite entanglement ( slocc orbits ) by the dual variety @xmath68 , i.e. , the hyperdeterminant @xmath108 .",
    "it leads to the partially ordered structure , such as fig .",
    "[ fig : part_order ] , of inequivalent multipartite entangled classes of pure states , which is significantly different from the totally ordered one in the bipartite case .",
    "local ranks are not enough to distinguish these classes , and we need to calculate slocc invariants associated with @xmath108 . in other words , the generic entangled class of the maximal dimension ( the outermost class ) is given by the outside of @xmath68 ( @xmath260 ) , and other multipartite entangled classes appear as @xmath68 or its different singularities . analytically , the classification of multipartite entanglement corresponds to that of the number and pattern of the solutions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : critical ] ) .",
    "this work reveals that the situation of the widely known bipartite or @xmath1-qubit cases , where the maximally entangled states in bell s inequalities belong to the generic class , is exceptional .",
    "lying far inside the onion structure , the maximally entangled states ( ghz ) are included in the lower dimensional peculiar class in general , e.g. , for the @xmath261 qubits .",
    "it suggests two points .",
    "the majority of multipartite entangled states can not convert to ghz by locc , and vice versa .",
    "so , we have given an alternative explanation to this observation , first made in @xcite by comparing the number of local parameters accessible in slocc with the dimension of the whole hilbert space .",
    "moreover , there seems no a priori reason why we choose ghz states as the _ canonical _ @xmath2-partite entangled states , which , for example , constitute a minimal reversible entanglement generating set ( mregs ) in asymptotically reversible locc @xcite .",
    "since the onion - like classification is given by every closed subset , not only our work enables us to see intuitively why , say in the @xmath1 qubits , the w class is rare compared to the ghz class , but it can be also extended to the classification of multipartite mixed states ( see appendix  [ sec : mixed ] ) .",
    "the onion - like classification seems to be reasonable in the sense that it coincides with the slocc classification when slocc gives finitely many orbits , such as the bipartite or @xmath1-qubit cases .",
    "so two states belonging to the same class can convert each other by invertible local operations with nonzero probabilities . on the other hand , when slocc gives infinitely many orbits , this classification is still slocc - invariant , but may contain in one class infinitely many _ same _ dimensional slocc orbits which can not locally convert to each other even probabilistically .",
    "for example , in the @xmath239-qubit case , the generic entangled class in eq.([eq : generic_4bit ] ) has three nonlocal continuous parameters .",
    "note that it can be possible to make the onion - like classification finer , by characterizing the nonlocal continuous parameters in each class .",
    "then , we may ask , what is the physical interpretation of the onion - like classification in the case of infinitely many slocc orbits ? although a simple answer has yet to be found , we discuss two points .",
    "( i ) let us consider _ global _ unitary operations which create the multipartite entanglement .",
    "on the one hand , states in distinct classes would have the different complexity of the global operations , since they have the distinct number and pattern of nonlocal parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "states in one class are supposed to have the equivalent complexity , since they just correspond to different `` angles '' of the global unitary operations .",
    "( ii ) we can consider the case where _ more than one _ state are shared , including the asymptotic case . even in two shared states",
    ", there can exist a local conversion which is impossible if they are operated separately , such as the catalysis effect @xcite .",
    "so we can expect that we do it more efficiently in this situation , and the coarse classification may have some physical significance .",
    "this problem remains unsettled even in the bipartite case .",
    "finally , two related topics are discussed .",
    "( i ) the absolute value @xmath262 of the hyperdeterminant , representing the amount of generic entanglement , is an entanglement monotone by vidal @xcite .",
    "this never conflicts with the property that the maximally entangled states in bell s inequalities ( ghz ) generally have a zero @xmath109 .",
    "a single entanglement monotone is insufficient to judge the locc convertibility , and generic entangled states of the nonzero @xmath109 can not convert to ghz in spite of decreasing @xmath262 .",
    "( ii ) the @xmath1-tangle @xmath263 first appeared in the context of so - called entanglement sharing @xcite ;",
    "i.e. , in the @xmath1 qubits , there is a constraint ( trade - off ) between the amount of @xmath46-partite entanglement and that of @xmath1-partite entanglement . by using the entanglement measure ( concurrence @xmath96 ) for the @xmath46-qubit _ mixed _ entangled states ,",
    "this is written as @xmath264 , and @xmath28 is defined by @xmath265 for the @xmath1-qubit _ pure _ entangled states .",
    "we expect that , in turn , the hyperdeterminant @xmath109 gives a clue to find the entanglement measure of more than @xmath46-qubit _ mixed _ states .",
    "the author would like to thank m. wadati , m. murao , g. kato , the members in the erato project of quantum computation and information , and the participants in the sixth quantum information technology symposium in japan on may ( 2002 ) for the most helpful discussions .",
    "the work is partially supported by the erato project .",
    "in sec .  [ sec:4 ] , we have classified entangled classes ( slocc orbits ) , utilizing slocc - invariant closed subvarieties such as the dual variety @xmath68 and its singularities . in this appendix",
    ", we give an intuitive explanation about our technique .",
    "we obtain entangled classes _ by their representatives_. the @xmath1-qubit case is exemplified , and the notation and terminology of sec .",
    "[ sec : sing ] is followed .",
    "as the representative of the outermost generic entangled class , almost any state ( indeed , satisfying @xmath266 ) in the whole space @xmath267 is qualified .",
    "the ghz state @xmath212 is chosen among them , since it can be seen as the multidimensional analog of the identity matrix .",
    "we look for the representative of the dual variety @xmath68 , which is qualified as that of the next outermost entangled class . when @xmath68 is the hyperplane tangent to the segre variety @xmath38 at @xmath155 such that @xmath268 ( @xmath176 ) , the `` @xmath155-section '' of @xmath68 is given as @xmath269 in order that eqs.([eq : critical ] ) have the nontrivial solution @xmath155 .",
    "this suggests that the representative of @xmath68 is the w state @xmath214 , since the states given by eq.([eq : xv_o ] ) and w convert to each other under some invertible local operations @xmath270 as @xmath271    the candidates for the next outer entangled class are two , node - type @xmath137 and cusp - type @xmath138 , singularities of @xmath68 .",
    "we first consider the representative of @xmath188 . according to eq.([eq : node ] ) , the @xmath155-section of @xmath188 is given as @xmath272 we find that the representative of @xmath188 is the biseparable state @xmath219 in @xmath220 , checking that @xmath273 in the same manner , @xmath274 or @xmath275 represents the biseparable class @xmath276 or @xmath277 , respectively .",
    "let us second analyze the representative of @xmath138 .",
    "in terms of the quadric part @xmath278 of @xmath81 at @xmath155 : @xmath279 the @xmath155-section of @xmath138 is given as @xmath280 we have three possibilities for @xmath281 . in the case of @xmath282 , this component of @xmath138 represents the biseparable class @xmath220 , since @xmath283 likewise , in the case of @xmath284 or @xmath285 , each component of @xmath138 corresponds to the biseparable class @xmath276 or @xmath277 , respectively . remembering that each @xmath204 is characterized by @xmath186 for @xmath176",
    ", we have shown that @xmath138 has three irreducible components @xmath186 .",
    "thus , the next outer entangled classes are three biseparable classes @xmath204 , which never contain nor are contained by each other .    in general , remaining entangled classes are given by further singularities of @xmath68 such as combinations of the above @xmath137 and @xmath138 , or genuine higher singularities .",
    "in the @xmath1-qubit case , since we see that @xmath186 , representing the biseparable class @xmath204 , is just characterized as @xmath286 , there remains just one smaller closed irreducible subvariety @xmath287 as their intersection @xmath288 .",
    "this segre variety @xmath38 represents the completely separable class @xmath180 , whose representative is @xmath222 .    in the text ,",
    "we have carried out the above procedure in the `` @xmath155-free '' manner ( @xmath155 should be taken as _",
    "any _ state on @xmath38 ) , and have obtained entangled classes as ( difference ) subsets .",
    "it enables us to decide readily which entangled class a given state @xmath4 belongs to .",
    "after the classification of entangled classes , we can clarify their partially ordered structure under noninvertible local operations in the same manner as in the text .",
    "the onion structure is also useful for the slocc - invariant classification of mixed entangled states .",
    "a mixed state @xmath29 can be written as a convex combination of projectors onto pure states ( extremal points ) , @xmath289 where @xmath290 is the pure state belonging to the slocc orbit @xmath291 of an index @xmath292 .",
    "@xmath292 is labeled by the closed subvariety @xmath293 ( i.e. , the closure of @xmath291 ) such as @xmath68 , @xmath139 , @xmath138 , and @xmath38 .",
    "note that , in the multipartite case , there can be many closed subvarieties @xmath293 which never contain nor are contained by each other ; for example , @xmath188 , @xmath274 , and @xmath275 in fig .",
    "[ fig : onion_3bit ] .",
    "so , by taking the union of these `` competitive '' closed subvarieties @xmath293 ( it will form their convex hull in the space of @xmath29 ) , we pick up only _ totally ordered _",
    "ones , e.g. , @xmath25 , @xmath68 , @xmath294 , and @xmath38 in fig .",
    "[ fig : onion_3bit ] , for convenience later . now , we are concerned with at most how various classes of pure entangled states the mixed state @xmath29 consists of .",
    "we take the maximal closure of @xmath293 appeared in eq.([eq : rho ] ) and denote it by @xmath295 . however , since @xmath29 can be decomposed into the form of eq.([eq : rho ] ) in infinitely many ways , we should take the minimal closure of @xmath295 over all possible decompositions , and write it as @xmath296 .",
    "every convex subset @xmath297 of @xmath298 is closed such that @xmath297 of the smaller @xmath292 is contained by that of the larger one .",
    "in other words , @xmath297 of the larger @xmath292 consists of more classes ( slocc orbits ) of pure entangled states .",
    "that is how the mixed state @xmath29 is classified into the _ closed _ convex subsets @xmath297 under slocc .    in the bipartite case",
    ", @xmath296 is called the schmidt number @xcite ( since @xmath293 is just labeled by the schmidt local rank , as seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "also in the @xmath1-qubit case , this kind of the classification has been done in @xcite , and four classes appear , following the above recipe : + ( i ) ghz class @xmath299 ( consisting of all pure states ) ; + ( ii ) w class @xmath300 ( consisting of the pure w , biseparable , or separable states ) ; + ( iii ) biseparable class @xmath301 ( consisting of the pure biseparable or separable states ) ; + ( iv ) separable class @xmath302 ( consisting of only the pure separable states ) .    needless to say , the trouble is considering all possible decompositions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "so , it is very difficult to give the criterion to distinguish each closed convex subset @xmath297 , even to distinguish the separable subset @xmath302 .",
    "still , it would be interesting to observe that a witness operator @xmath303 , which forms the tangent hyperplane @xmath304 detecting @xmath297 a given @xmath29 belongs to , shares the same idea as our dual variety .",
