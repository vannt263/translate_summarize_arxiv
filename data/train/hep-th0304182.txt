    "the most familiar and elementary concept of confinement in qcd is the area law for wilson loops . for non - relativistic problems , such as the low - lying bound states of heavy quarks ,",
    "the simple implementation of this idea is through a linearly - rising potential .",
    "but after thirty years of qcd it is still not at all clear how to address , in the continuum and for @xmath11 , the dynamics of light - mass @xmath10 bound states and similar relativistic problems where the notion of potential breaks down . in the early days of qcd",
    ", many authors ( for example , @xcite ) suggested that a good approximation in @xmath12 would be to use an effective gluon propagator behaving like @xmath13 for small momentum @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the string tension ( the omitted terms in eq .",
    "( [ gluprop ] ) are longitudinal ) .",
    "the non - relativistic potential derived from this effective propagator is indeed linearly - rising , and in the relativistic regime yields a linearly - rising regge trajectory at large angular momentum @xmath4 .",
    "( as discussed in @xcite , the @xmath10 problem is relativistic for quark mass @xmath16 if @xmath17 . ) but this effective low - momentum propagator can not be entirely correct ; for example , it can not be used as an effective propagator between gluons themselves , which are screened and not confined .    when phenomenological approaches such as @xcite , using eq .",
    "( [ gluprop ] ) , were first taken up , there was little understanding of how confinement actually worked in qcd . since then",
    ", many people have come to believe in the center - vortex picture of confinement .",
    "( for early work in the center - vortex picture , see @xcite ; an up - to - date review is in @xcite . ) in this picture , center vortices ( of co - dimension 2 ) can link topologically with a wilson loop ; with a spaghetti - like condensate of center vortices , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) over gauge fields of a wilson loop results in an area law ( for group representations where the center is non - trivially represented ) .",
    "the vortices have finite thickness , but as far as the area law is concerned , thickness effects represent perimeter corrections ignored in this paper .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold : first , to argue , in physics language , that center - vortex dynamics leads to the prescription that , for a given wilson loop , the area in the area law is extremal for that loop .",
    "our second goal is to formulate the relativistic large-@xmath4 dynamics of quarks in this extremal - area center - vortex picture , and to compare this dynamics to earlier work , such as the effective - propagator model and various string models , in particular that of @xcite ) .",
    "we will find that the extremal - area picture agrees ( to the extent that they can be compared ) with @xcite , but gives a different value for the regge slope than does @xcite .",
    "we will study mostly semi - classical dynamics , which should be appropriate for large angular momentum @xmath4 , and indicate how integration over fluctuations of wilson loops gives rise to corrections which vanish at large @xmath4 .",
    "we will not address the full complications of relativistic @xmath10 dynamics , including quark spin , perturbative gluon exchange , and the like .",
    "our focus will be on finding the asymptotic slope of the linearly - rising regge trajectory which ( we will show ) arises in the extremal - area picture .    even before what we will call qcd - inspired models , such as that of @xcite , many authors had studied linearly - rising regge trajectories in the context of the veneziano model and various simple models of particles joined by strings ; for example , see @xcite .",
    "the canonical relation between the string tension @xmath15 and the regge slope @xmath18 , based on making classical string theory agree with the veneziano model , is : @xmath19 other models give somewhat different values for the numerical constant on the right - hand side .",
    "more recently , string theorists @xcite have constructed models of @xmath12 strings which could represent hypothetical strings joining quarks .",
    "there is no reason that the general qcd - inspired model should give the veneziano / string theory regge slope , since the veneziano model , which pre - dates qcd , does not necessarily capture the true dynamical features of qcd , and there is a big difference between the properties of literal , physical strings which join quarks and the area - law dynamics proposed in the present paper , based on center vortices .",
    "moreover , to the extent that string theory is conformally - invariant there is no room in the string - theory action for separate kinetic terms for quarks .",
    "( in an effective string theory , massive quarks can be represented as the ending of open strings on finitely - separated branes , yielding appropriate kinetic terms . )",
    "the difference between literal strings and center - vortex dynamics is that the area in the area law for literal strings can fluctuate even though the contour ( wilson loop ) is fixed , and these fluctuations need to be taken into account , while for center - vortex dynamics the area in question is minimal , and there are no surface fluctuations for a fixed bounding contour .    in sec .",
    "[ arearg ] we discuss at some length the question of how one argues that the euclidean center - vortex area law involves extremal areas .",
    "the standard naive argument leads to an area law , but it is far from clear what surface and area are to be used for a given wilson loop .",
    "we adopt a center - vortex model which retains only those features necessary to discuss this question of the area law .",
    "the model consists of a condensate of infinitesimally - thin closed vortex lines ( @xmath0 ) or sheets ( @xmath12 ) a finite fraction of which have infinite length .",
    "these vortices are characterized by two lengths : a persistence length and a density of vortex pierce points per unit area . in this model",
    "we show that the area in the area law is indeed extremal . as stated above",
    ", finite - thickness vortices lead only to perimeter - law corrections .",
    "once the extremal - area law is established , we face the problem ( the plateau problem ) @xcite of finding the extremal area associated with a given bounding wilson loop . in sec .",
    "[ hope ] we remind the reader of some well - known obstacles to solving the plateau problem .",
    "these include the behavior of extremal areas for poorly - behaved contours , such as space - filling contours , and the general existence of more than one extremal area for a given contour .",
    "we speculate that some of these peculiarities might actually be observable in qcd dynamics .",
    "for example , two parallel and equal circles separated axially have ( at least ) two extremal areas : the areas of the circles , and a catenoid joining them .",
    "one or the other is a global extremum , depending on the axial separation of the circles .",
    "the transition from one global minimum to the other may be related to the behavior of the adjoint potential , which is a breakable string .    in sec .",
    "[ contour ] we consider how to express a euclidean extremal area in contour form .",
    "this is actually elementary but not commonly used ( string theorists , for example , usually use standard integrals over the world sheet ) .",
    "the easiest case is @xmath2 , where any simple area is a global minimum , and can be expressed as a quadratic form in the contour . in higher dimensions the area law is simplest in dirichlet form , which requires imposition of gauge conditions in the form of choosing isothermal coordinates .",
    "the dirichlet form of the area is still quadratic in the variables describing the surface , but this is misleading , because this is so only in isothermal coordinates .",
    "we show that imposing isothermality leads to quartic terms in the surface variables , in any dimension greater than two .",
    "( in @xmath2 isothermality is automatic . ) after expressing the dirichlet form of the extremal area as a contour functional , we take up the issue of how to enforce isothermality , and end up with a modified contour functional which is quartic in the contour variables . in certain cases these quartic terms may be dealt with as perturbations around a flat surface .",
    "this area contour functional , plus kinetic terms , describes a one - dimensional field theory of contours .",
    "this is to be contrasted to string - theoretic forms of confinement , which lead to two - dimensional field theories .",
    "it is far from easy ( but not impossible ; see @xcite ) to find the right form of such a theory for confinement , since standard bosonic string theory has a critical dimension of 26 .    in @xmath0 isothermality",
    "can be identically satisfied by a choice of functions describing the surface , as weierstrass and enneper showed long ago .",
    "however , the enneper - weierstrass formulation does not make it easy to express an extremal area as a functional of its bounding contour , in general . as would be expected from the paragraph above",
    ", the enneper - weierstrass area form is quartic in its variables .",
    "we also show in sec .",
    "[ contour ] that the dirichlet area law in contour form has an interpretation , in @xmath20 dimensions , as a contour integral over @xmath20 abelian gauge potentials .",
    "alternatively , in @xmath0 or @xmath1 one may choose a single abelian gauge potential and a complex scalar field as the degrees of freedom .",
    "these , as comtet @xcite as shown , can be identified with witten s @xcite degrees of freedom for spherically - symmetric @xmath12 @xmath21 gauge theory .",
    "we will pursue this connection further elsewhere .    in sec .",
    "[ appl ] we apply this formalism to some simple problems of ( spinless ) @xmath10 relativistic dynamics in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and in sec . [ 3dsec ] to the @xmath5 problem of @xcite , @xcite ( which is , at the classical level , actually a problem in @xmath1 , since one spatial coordinate is inert ) .",
    "given the action ( including kinetic terms ) as a functional of wilson loops , one must integrate over all wilson loops to construct green s functions .",
    "an example of such an integral , for scalar  quarks \" in euclidean space , is the free quark propagator : @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the scalar - quark mass ; @xmath23 are proper - time variables ; and the integral @xmath24 is an integral over contours , subject to the constraint that these contours pass through @xmath25 at @xmath26 and @xmath27 at @xmath28 . for @xmath10 dynamics",
    "one introduces a quark and and anti - quark propagator such as in eq .",
    "( [ green ] ) , plus the appropriate area - law action , and integrates over both quark and anti - quark contours . as one expects , the @xmath2 or @xmath3 dynamics is exactly equivalent to the well - studied and ancient problem of large-@xmath29 two - dimensional qcd , and our discussion of two dimensions is largely review .    in this section",
    "we take up the problem of circular @xmath10 orbits at large angular momentum @xmath4 , using the extremal - area formalism , and compare to the results of @xcite , which used the effective propagator of eq .",
    "( [ gluprop ] ) , and of @xcite , which used a naive string model . very fortunately",
    ", it is quite elementary to find the extremal surface expressed in isothermal coordinates ( a helicoid ) and its area analytically , corresponding to the semiclassical orbits ( a double helix ) arising from solving the classical equations of motion",
    ". one surprising feature of the extremal - area model is that in the small - mass regime ( meaning @xmath17 ) the quark kinetic energy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the usual relativistic factor , vanishes in comparison to the energy coming from the extremal - area action .",
    "this is rather different from the results of @xcite , where @xmath30 does not vanish relative to area - law energy .",
    "the significance of this vanishing is that , in some sense , the extremal - area law is rather like string theory which has no separate kinetic terms for quarks .",
    "note that this small - mass regime does not require literal masslessness , which is in any case impossible in qcd , since even quarks of zero current mass undergo chiral symmetry breakdown driven by confinement itself , which leads to mass generation with @xmath32 .",
    "we will not attempt to model such effects here , and will in fact ignore area - law terms responsible for constituent - mass generation .",
    "but we do show that both non - leading classical terms and certain quantum corrections both yield additive corrections to the bound - state energy @xmath33 which are of the same form as mass terms , that is , @xmath34 .    as a result of the vanishing of quark kinetic energy relative to area energy for the extremal - area model , the regge slope ",
    "string tension product of this model is precisely that of the veneziano / string model of eq .",
    "( [ veneziano ] ) .",
    "this slope differs significantly from that found in @xcite ; we find that this is because for any area - like model where quark kinetic energy is significant in the large-@xmath4 limit , the regge slope is necessarily smaller than the veneziano / string slope . we also show that identically the same classical area action governs the present work and that of @xcite .",
    "these authors quote , but do not derive , the veneziano / string slope as applicable to their model . the identity of classical actions",
    "does not mean that the string model of @xcite and the extremal - area model are _ physically _ identical , because presumably in the string model the world surface of the string is subject to the usual sort of quantum fluctuations that strings have , even when the wilson loop it joins is fixed .",
    "but in the center - vortex picture of the present paper the nature of the fluctuations is quite different : for a given wilson loop there is a unique surface , at least if the loop is sufficiently well - behaved , and perimeter - law fluctuations arise from the thickness of center vortices , not from surface fluctuations .    in section [ appl ]",
    "we also show how certain integrations over quantum fluctuations of the contours lead to corrections which vanish as @xmath35 .",
    "for simplicity , we restrict our explicit considerations to @xmath21 gauge theory ; this avoids complications with nexuses , baryonic wilson loops , and similar topological elaborations occurring for @xmath36 .",
    "our center - vortex model consists of a vacuum condensate of infinitesimally - thick oriented vortices , of co - dimension 2 ( so points in @xmath2 , closed lines in @xmath0 , closed two - surfaces in @xmath12 ) , characterized by two ( presumably related ) quantities : an areal density @xmath37 of vortex pierce points per unit area and a persistence length @xmath38 .",
    "the density @xmath37 is the number of vortices penetrating an element of area , divided by that area , each pierce point being counted as + 1 .",
    "each vortex can be considered as a closed random walk which avoids itself and other vortices ( subject to the constraint that the density is @xmath37 ) , and the persistence length is , as usual , the length over which the direction of the random walk decorrelates .",
    "as is well - known , the vev of a wilson loop is an average over vacuum gauge - field configurations of phase factors constructed from link numbers of the vortex configuration with the wilson loop . for @xmath21",
    "the phase factor is @xmath39 for link number @xmath40 , so that only the link number mod 2 counts .",
    "the total link number of a given vortex with a wilson loop is found by adding numbers @xmath41 ( depending on the relative orientation of vortex and wilson loop ) for each oriented intersection of the vortex with a surface spanning the wilson loop . because the linkage of an idealized zero - thickness center vortex and a wilson loop is topological",
    ", it is tempting to say that the area - law part of the wilson - loop vev is stationary under changes of the surface spanning the loop when the loop is held fixed , and so the surface is extremal .",
    "this is , however , a seriously incomplete argument .",
    "let us review the standard but sloppy argument for the area law in center vortex theory .",
    "we write the wilson - loop vev as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the link number associated with the @xmath44 pierce point of the spanning surface , and @xmath29 is the total number of pierce points of vortices with the spanning surface .",
    "some vortices intersect the spanning surface only once ( or an odd number of times ) and contribute -1 to the sum of terms in the loop vev ; others intersect not at all ( or an even number of times ) and contribute a phase factor + 1 , as if they were not present at all .",
    "suppose that the wilson loop under consideration is large , in the sense that all its spatial scales are large compared to the persistence length @xmath38 and the density length @xmath45 , and mathematically benign , for example , @xmath46 , not self - intersecting , and so forth .",
    "then the total number of pierce points @xmath47 of the spanning surface @xmath48 , with area @xmath49 , is large . each pierce point",
    "is associated with a partial link number @xmath43 .",
    "a certain fraction @xmath50 of these @xmath51 are independent and random ; the remainder are link numbers of vortices which are small compared to the wilson loop scales , and are not linked .",
    "one might then argue that the wilson - loop vev is found by assuming gaussian statistics for the independent link numbers .",
    "( actually , poisson statistics , but this fine point is irrelevant to us ) . then this vev would be given by : @xmath52\\ ] ] with @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the total number of independent vortices .    at this point",
    "an area law is apparently established , but it is far from clear what area is to be used . to say that the area @xmath55 in the area law is the area of an arbitrarily - chosen surface @xmath48 makes no sense for the general spanning surface , for example , one whose scale lengths and area are astronomical in scale , although there is nothing wrong with using such a surface .",
    "the vev is quite independent of which surface is chosen , contradicting the naive interpretation of eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) .",
    "yet there must be some surface @xmath56 , of area @xmath57 , such that the vev is given by this equation : @xmath58.\\ ] ] this must be the area of some surface @xmath48 spanning the wilson loop ; if @xmath48 did not span it , some vortex linkages would not be counted .",
    "what went wrong is the assumption that all the @xmath51 are actually independent , even for vortices very long compared to the wilson loop size . consider the vortex associated with a particular pierce point @xmath59 .",
    "let us consider a topological configuration consisting of two surfaces each spanning the wilson loop , one of them being an arbitrary surface @xmath48 that is far from the correct surface and the other the correct ( but unknown ) surface @xmath56 .",
    "the surface @xmath60 is a closed surface with no boundaries ; we choose it to be oriented .",
    "since all vortices are closed , if a vortex pierces the surface @xmath48 it must pierce the surface @xmath60 an odd number of times more . for simplicity , we state the argument explicitly for vortices which penetrate exactly once more . consider the fate of a given vortex which enters the volume enclosed by @xmath60 by penetrating @xmath48 . upon exiting this volume",
    "it can penetrate either @xmath48 or @xmath56 again .",
    "if it penetrates @xmath48 but not @xmath56 it is not linked to the wilson loop ; otherwise it is .",
    "evidently , the probability @xmath61 that the given vortex will in fact penetrate the wilson loop is @xmath62 . in effect , the mean - square link number @xmath63 is not 1 , but @xmath61 , and the area law does come out in the form of eq .",
    "( [ rightlaw ] ) , and is independent of the originally - chosen surface @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , this argument does not tell us how to choose @xmath56 .",
    "this argument holds unless the surface @xmath48 is very close to the correct surface @xmath56 , in which case the link numbers and pierce points of the two surfaces are strongly correlated .",
    "consider a new choice of spanning surface @xmath64 which is very close to the correct surface , and calculate the wilson - loop vev with the surface @xmath64 .",
    "the area of this spanning surface is @xmath65 .",
    "either the link numbers @xmath51 of the correct surface @xmath56 become those of the new surface , without change , or new pierce points arise in pairs , with total link number 0 .",
    "these new pierce points arise if in going from @xmath56 to @xmath64 an unlinked vortex which penetrated one of these surfaces twice does not penetrate the other one at all . but these effects cancel when averaged over many gauge configurations , and provided that the spatial scale of the deviation @xmath66 is small compared to the persistence length , do not happen at all .",
    "the result is that the wilson - loop vev is precisely the same for the two surfaces : @xmath67=\\exp [ -\\frac{\\pi^2}{2}\\xi \\rho ( a(s_{wl})+\\delta a)]\\ ] ] and so @xmath68 ; the correct surface is extremal .",
    "as mathematicians know , it is hopeless to give a completely general solution to the plateau problem , because of the variety of contour and surface types that could be encountered . it is a theorem that any jordan curve possesses at least one extremal area which spans the curve , but there can be infinitely many such areas , in pathological cases .",
    "there is no particular reason , for example , to suppose that the contour spanned by a minimal surface is at all regular .",
    "an example is a random walk , or something like hilbert s space - filling curve .",
    "it could happen that such a curve generates an area which grows faster than @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is a maximal diameter of the contour . from eq .",
    "( [ diripart ] ) below , one proves by elementary arguments the inequality for the minimal area @xmath49 : @xmath71 where @xmath40 is the length of the contour and @xmath70 a maximum diameter . for a contour generated by a random walk , @xmath72 where @xmath73 characterizes the average step length for the walk .",
    "it is then possible , from eq .",
    "( [ inequal ] ) , that the area grows as fast as @xmath74 . however , if this rate of growth were actually achieved , it could not be important for the infrared behavior of wilson loops , since the contributions of a loop averaged over gauge fields decays exponentially as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the string tension .",
    "the mathematical reality is that we can only make progress with well - behaved contours , and we assume good behavior at every step of our arguments .",
    "even with this assumption of well - behaved contours and surfaces , some interesting questions arise .",
    "there are many contours which have more than one extremal area .",
    "consider , for example , two equal - size circles whose planes are parallel ; depending on the separation between the circles ( in units of the circles radius ) several extremal areas are possible , as shown in fig .",
    "we may think of the loops in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as being idealized representations of nearby @xmath10 pairs as would occur in a hybrid meson .",
    "the mere geometrical existence of an extremal area does not mean it makes sense in a confining gauge theory .",
    "for example , the configuration of surfaces shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a is not sensible in @xmath21 gauge theory , with the usual interpretation of the intersection of a center vortex ( a closed line that , if linked @xmath76 times to a fundamental wilson loop , gives rise to the factor @xmath77 for the wilson loop ) .",
    "this intersection number @xmath76 can be calculated by counting the number of signed intersections of the wilson loop with an orientable surface spanning the loop .",
    "a simple center vortex can be linked once positively to both wilson loops of fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , and then it contributes a factor of unity to the product of wilson loops , just as if it were linked to neither .",
    "but in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a it is possible either for a vortex so linked to pass through the central plane surface and for it not to ; in the former case , one would assign a factor of -1 to the product of wilson loops , and in the latter , a factor of + 1 .",
    "this figure can make sense for @xmath78 with the assignment of fluxes to surfaces consistent with the rules for associating a nexus world line with the line where three surfaces meet in the figure .",

    "[ fig1]b , c make sense .",
    "the same link numbers are found by counting penetrations of either spanning surface by a center vortex .",
    "but the areas to be used in the area law for wilson loop vevs are clearly different , and so apparently is the interpretation . for fig .",
    "[ fig1]b the wilson loops are correlated , in that the spanning surface depends on both loops , but in fig . [ fig1]c they are uncorrelated .",
    "interestingly , as one would expect on physical grounds , when the separation of the loops is large enough ( roughly equal to their common radius ) the catenoid suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig1]b is not a global minimum ; only the independent planar surfaces of fig .",
    "[ fig1]c are .",
    "this suggests the possibility of _ short - ranged _ van der waals - like forces between two hadrons , not necessarily associated with meson exchange , and also has implications for the behavior of the screening law for adjoint wilson loops , and area laws for @xmath29-ality non - zero representations of @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "we will explore these issues elsewhere .",
    "certain of our remarks apply in all dimensions , while some are specific to @xmath0 . also of interest are elementary area formulas in @xmath2 , because their contour version resembles what we will find in higher dimensions to some extent , with the contours acting as currents sources for a @xmath2 abelian gauge propagator .",

    "in this paper we argued in some detail for expressing the dynamical area law of qcd as a law of extremal surfaces , based on the topological mechanism of confinement in center - vortex models . in principle",
    "the area of an extremal surface can be expressed as a functional of the contour ( wilson loop ) spanned by the surface .",
    "confined - particle dynamics and bound states follow from functional integrals over these contours , which amounts to a @xmath180 field theory .",
    "this is unlike earlier attempts to deal with area - law dynamics , in which string surfaces associated with tubes of confined flux have @xmath2 fluctuations which must be integrated over , even for a fixed wilson loop .",
    "these fluctuations , existing over the whole world surface of the flux tube , lead to severe complications @xcite .",
    "but in the center - vortex picture , fluctuations have effect only on subdominant ( perimeter ) terms and are much more easily dealt with .",
    "we also pointed out some of the challenges associated with this law , such as the existence of several extremal areas for certain contours , and discussed some questions of the behavior of extremal areas for the sort of non - differentiable contours likely to occur in the functional integral over wilson - loop contours .",
    "certain more complicated contour configurations may have to do with adjoint string breaking and related phenomena .",
    "the contour form expression for an extremal area has an interpretation in terms of wilson loops of @xmath20 abelian gauge potentials , in @xmath20 dimensions .",
    "there is a natural definition of a gauge transformation , leaving the area unchanged , on each of these gauge potentials .",
    "it is interesting to note that in @xmath0 the degrees of freedom can be reinterpreted as one abelian gauge potential plus a complex scalar field , which happen to be the degrees of freedom identified by witten @xcite in his spherical _ ansatz _ for @xmath21 gauge fields .",
    "comtet @xcite has shown that the @xmath21 self - duality equations for these degrees of freedom are precisely those extremalize a surface in @xmath1 .",
    "what the connection is between our work and this earlier work remains to be seen ; it is under investigation .",
    "these contour formulas are simple generalizations of area formulas in @xmath2 , which express an area as the interaction of a massless @xmath2 gauge propagator with currents running along the wilson - loop contour , just as required by @xmath2 qcd",
    ". however , their simplicity is deceiving , since the contour form of the area law holds only for the dirichlet integral , which expresses a true extremal area only under the imposition of isothermal gauge conditions .",
    "isothermality leads to expressions both quadratic and quartic in the contours , and so the extremal - surface form is an interacting field theory of these @xmath180 contours .",
    "we gave one simple example in @xmath5 ( actually applicable to @xmath5 problems ) of a classical extremal - area law , in which the quark and anti - quark contours were helices and the extremal area a helicoid .",
    "we compared the large-@xmath4 results of this center - vortex model with two earlier models , one an effective - propagator model @xcite and one a naive string model @xcite , and found that the present results differ from those of @xcite but agree with those of @xcite , even to the extent that the actions of @xcite and of the present paper are mathematically identical .",
    "however , this does not mean that the _ physical _ content of these two models are the same ; presumably at the quantum level the string model would involve functional integrations over string fluctuations , while in the center - vortex picture such fluctuations are missing .    in the heavy - quark limit , all approaches including that given here agree with one another and with the conventional quantum mechanics of a linearly - rising potential .",
    "but there is a curious effect in the limit of quarks whose mass @xmath16 approaches zero .",
    "one generally expects that in this limit the quark kinetic energy @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the usual relativistic factor , is finite .",
    "this is , for example , what happens in the effective - propagator model .",
    "but in the extremal - area model , retardation effects lead to an extra factor of @xmath312 in the force term of the @xmath10 equation of motion , which has the consequence that @xmath335 in the limit , and thus vanishes .",
    "the quark kinetic terms in the action no longer contribute , and only the area - law part is left .",
    "this , of course , is what string theory would prescribe , and in fact the extremal - area model studied here yields precisely the veneziano / string result @xmath248 .",
    "generally , in any model where quark kinetic terms survive the massless limit , this product is smaller than @xmath7 .    under the circumstances where the semi - classical developments of this paper are applicable , such as for bound states of large angular momentum @xmath4 , there is a smallness parameter @xmath9 which allows one to expand deviations from three - dimensional contours , dominant at large @xmath4 , into the fourth spatial dimension .",
    "we made some estimates which showed that such fluctuations yield corrections vanishing at large @xmath4 , as expected .",
