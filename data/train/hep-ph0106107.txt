    "<S> we propose a model in which lepton number is broken by the right handed majorana mass @xmath21 , and where calculable dirac neutrino masses are induced at one loop via the exchange of singlet charged scalar fields .    </S>",
    "<S> the model is the standard model extended by introducing two singlet charged scalar fields , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> no extra doublet is needed here . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce three families of right - handed neutrinos @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume for the moment that the total lepton number is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> the most general relevant part of the lagrangian consistent with this symmetry is given by : @xmath25 where , @xmath26 , @xmath27 denote generation indices . </S>",
    "<S> the couplings @xmath20 are antisymmetric in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , while @xmath28 are arbitrary . </S>",

    "<S> however at this stage a coupling between the standard model higgs and the right handed neutrino is allowed . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of such term in the lagrangian leads to a dirac mass for the neutrino , and one needs to fine tune the yukawa coupling to produce @xmath32 . to forbid these couplings </S>",
    "<S> we impose a @xmath33 symmetry acting as follows : @xmath34 @xmath35 in the limit where @xmath33 is unbroken the dirac mass for the neutrino vanishes to any order of perturbation theory . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath53 vanishes , since the @xmath54 antisymmetric matrix @xmath55 has zero determinant . </S>",
    "<S> the same feature has been noticed in another model @xcite with a doubly charged scalar . </S>",
    "<S> the higher loop correction can always be written in the form @xmath56 , where y depends on the parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> thus at any higher loop level one of the neutrinos remains massless . </S>",
    "<S> note that although the charged lepton masses receive corrections at one loop by replacing the charged lepton fields in fig.@xmath43 by the dirac neutrino fields , this correction is @xmath57 , which can safely be neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us study the phenomenological constraints on the parameters of the model . </S>",
    "<S> the physical charged scalar fields @xmath48 and @xmath49 can mediate the decays @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . the muon decay ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the more stringent constraint on @xmath69 is derived from universality of the @xmath70 decay which gives@xcite @xmath71 a useful constraint on @xmath72 can be obtained from @xmath73 universality which gives the bound @xmath74 the charged scalars @xmath48 and @xmath49 contribute to the @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward calculation gives : @xmath76 and by using the experimental upper limit @xmath77 we obtain @xmath78 another bound on the @xmath79 couplings @xmath80 can be drived from the constraint on the michel parameter @xmath81 . using the experimental bounds from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we obtain @xmath82 note that the decay @xmath83 will be forbidden kinimatically in the seesaw case , since the mass of the right handed neutrino is much bigger than the mass of the muon . note that for @xmath84tev and @xmath85 , @xmath86 the above constraints are satisfied .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us turn to the mixings and the masses relevant for neutrino oscillations , we assume for simplicity @xmath87 , such that the model has four remaining parameters . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino mass matrix is symmetric , and has the following form : @xmath88\\ ] ] where @xmath89 corresponds to the scale of neutrino mass in this model , and it is given by : @xmath90 where in deriving the above relation we have assumed that the charged higgs @xmath91 is heavier than @xmath48 . for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , which implies that the parameters @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that a stable @xmath95 neutrino mass can be problematic for cosmology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> morever primordial nucleosynthesis excludes a dirac neutrino mass from @xmath96 to @xmath97@xcite , which implies that @xmath55 should be less than one .    </S>",
    "<S> if there is no strong hierarchy between the yukawa couplings @xmath55 , then the matrix element @xmath98 can be safely neglected , and the eigenvalues of @xmath99 are @xmath100 this means that @xmath101 is the scale relevant for atmospheric neutrino oscillations , which implies that @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> however the explanation of the solar neutrino anomaly requires a fine tuning between @xmath103 and @xmath104 such that @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath99 can be diagonalized ( neglecting cp violation in the leptonic sector ) by the following orthogonal transformation : @xmath106\\ ] ] where : @xmath107 from the above mixing matrix one can see that the large mixing angle required for the atmospheric neutrino oscillations can not be satisfied simultanously with the required smallness of the @xmath108 element . </S>",
    "<S> one could ask if the model can accomodate both the atmospheric and solar neutrino anomalies for @xmath80 @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> however we have performed an analysis of all possible parameters @xmath55 , @xmath80 , and we found no solution that can fit both atmospheric and solar neutrino puzzles with @xmath110 .    </S>",
    "<S> now let us assume that lepton number is broken by the right handed neutrino mass term : @xmath111 the masses of the light neutrinos are obtained by diagonalizing the following mass matrix in the basis @xmath112 : @xmath113\\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix induced at one loop as in eq.(@xmath115 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the seesaw approximation ( @xmath116 ) implies @xmath117 we will assume that the yukawa coupling constants @xmath55 , @xmath80 are of order unity , and @xmath118,@xmath119 and @xmath47 in the tev range . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the light majorana neutrino masses are smaller than ev . </S>",
    "<S> of course , one of the eigenvalues will vanishe , and this requires the other masses to be in the atmospheric and solar neutrino ranges . </S>",
    "<S> this can be easily accomodated since the seesaw fomula is very sensitive to any deviation of the coupling constants from unity , since it varies as the fourth power of the coupling constants .    </S>",
    "<S> the model can not predict the mixing angles since the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath80 are arbitrary , in contrast to the zee model , in which the neutrino mass matrix has vanishing diagonal elements without any fine tuning or imposing extra symmetries . however , </S>",
    "<S> unlike the dirac case , the seesaw neutrino mass matrix can accomodate the atmospheric and the solar anomalies . </S>",
    "<S> choosing the yukawa parameters @xmath120 to take the values : @xmath121 with the right handed neutrino masses @xmath122 , leads to a bimaximal mixing with large angle msw @xcite effect as the solution to the solar neutrino puzzle . </S>",
    "<S> the numbers above suggest that one can easily choose a texture for the matrix @xmath80 , that can fit both the atmospheric and solar neutrino data .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed a model for generating small majorana neutrino masses at the tev scale using the seesaw mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the smallness of the neutrino masses in this model is not due to the largness of the right handed neutrino mass , but to the smallness of the dirac masses . </S>",
    "<S> the model may also have an intersting implication for cosmology@xcite . </S>"
