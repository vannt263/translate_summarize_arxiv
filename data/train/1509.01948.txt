    "motivated by experiments in ultracold atoms @xcite , there has been a resurgence of interest in exploring the fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics and whether statistical properties can emerge from unitary time evolution . to this end , recent attempts in describing thermalization in closed quantum systems focused on time - evolving observables that are local to a subsystem and how they approach thermal equilibrium described by gibbs ensemble @xcite .",
    "one proposed mechanism to understand thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth ) @xcite .",
    "the eth conjectures that under certain conditions , the expectation value of a physically relevant observable will have a long - time average close to an appropriate microcanonical ensemble prediction . when testing the eth , the system is usually driven out of equilibrium by a quantum quench in the parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "the eth was numerically tested against other hypotheses and it was shown that for initial states following the conditions of the eth , thermalization is achieved within observables @xcite . to introduce basic ideas of the eth , consider an initial state @xmath0 , which is not an eigenstate of some postquench or final hamiltonian @xmath1 without any degeneracies .",
    "then , the initial state can be expanded in terms of the eigenstates of @xmath1 with eigenvalues @xmath2 as @xmath3 after the quench , the initial state will undergo time evolution as @xmath4 and therefore , the expectation value of an observable is given by @xmath5 with @xmath6 .",
    "due to dephasing , eq .",
    "will relax to the infinite - time average , @xmath7 this long - time average is commonly referred to as the diagonal ensemble prediction due to the diagonal ensemble , @xmath8 . according to the eth , the diagonal ensemble average of an observable , eq .",
    ", is close to an appropriate microcanonical average @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of eigenstates within a narrow energy window @xmath12 around the initial mean energy of the system @xmath13 . the last equality in eq .",
    "is true if the eigenstate expectation value ( eev ) , @xmath14 , is a smooth function of @xmath2 , while the off - diagonal elements @xmath15 are negligible @xcite .",
    "there is no rigorous analytical proof of the eth but different numerical studies on spin systems and lattice models both for small and large system sizes support its validity @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of relaxation is the question of how local observables equilibrate .",
    "this is particularly important in the dynamics of nearly integrable systems , which may exhibit a two - stage equilibration process .",
    "both theoretical and experimental studies have investigated the nature of prethermalization in various physical setups @xcite .",
    "the emergence of statistical relaxation can also be linked to the onset of quantum chaos as highlighted by previous studies @xcite . in this context",
    ", particular emphasis is laid on the form of the energy distribution of an initial state and how it compares with predictions of quantum chaos .",
    "we utilize this approach to demonstrate chaotic initial states even for energies far from the middle of the spectrum of eigenenergies , an extension of the findings in ref .",

    ", we study the nonequilibrium dynamics of interacting bosons in a one - dimensional double - well potential , which can be modelled using a two - site multilevel bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "contrary to previous studies dealing with few atoms in multiple lattice sites , we study the other limit of having finite large number of bosons confined in few sites . as a matter of fact , it was checked that this system will thermalize due to the ergodicity of the associated mean - field trajectories in the semiclassical limit of large @xmath16 @xcite . here",
    ", we only consider @xmath17 bosons and use exact diagonalization to access the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of the final hamiltonian .",
    "first , we determine the chaoticity of the postquench hamiltonian on the basis of spectral statistics .",
    "we then verify the validity of the eth in this system .",
    "our results based on the distribution of eev illustrate that not all eigenstates are thermal . using all possible initial product state configurations",
    ", we compare the expectation values of local operators obtained using the diagonal and the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "most of the studies related to subsystem thermalization involve spatial partitioning of the system @xcite .",
    "instead , we implement a different partitioning scheme where a subsystem will consist of only one mode , either the lower or the upper level in one of the wells . since thermalization is a dynamical process , we also compute the time evolution of local operators and the von neumann entropy of a subsystem .",
    "we find that the relaxation dynamics of the von neumann entropy is instructive in revealing prethermalization in the system .",
    "moreover , we observe that fast relaxation of a local operator correlates with a rapid single - step growth of the von neumann entropy as it approaches the gibbs entropy . on the other hand ,",
    "we observe a two - stage relaxation process for initial states close to the middle of the spectrum .",
    "finally , we discuss a possible mechanism for the prethermalization in the system and the associated time scales .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : modquench ] , we first describe the model and the quench protocol used in this work .",

    "a single boson can occupy four modes ( two single - particle levels in each well ) , which can be described by the following two - level generalization of the bose - hubbard model @xcite :     adds another degree of freedom in the system , which is expected to break integrability .

    "the parameters in eq . can be easily evaluated for a specific realization of the double - well potential described by the single - particle hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath25 the localized functions @xmath26 in level @xmath27 and site @xmath28 are obtained by symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the eigenstates of the single particle hamiltonian in eq . .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath29 .",
    "the tunneling terms between wells are @xmath30 .",
    "the interaction terms between atoms in the same well and the same energy level are @xmath31 .",
    "there is also an interlevel coupling corresponding to the two - atom hopping term between energy levels in the same well given by @xmath32 .",
    "the limit of @xmath33 is the integrable bose - hubbard dimer model for a double well , which was extensively studied before in different contexts @xcite .",
    "integrability of the dimer can be broken by adding one or more degrees of freedom without changing the number of conserved quantities , which for the dimer model corresponds to the energy and the number of bosons @xcite .",
    "a finite value of @xmath34 introduces additional degrees of freedom and thus breaks the integrability of the system . note",
    "that upon choosing the trap parameters , the only free parameter in the system is the coupling constant @xmath35 , which affects both @xmath36 and @xmath34 .",
    "this is a subtle detail that we need to keep in mind as blindly increasing the interaction @xmath35 ( in hopes of increasing the integrability breaking term @xmath34 ) will actually push the system towards a strongly interacting regime dominated by quasidegeneracies @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the quench protocol used in our study of the nonequilibrium dynamics in the system .",
    "we consider a partitioning of the system such that each mode is considered as a subsystem and the remaining three modes will act as an environment .",
    "initially , the number of bosons in each mode is fixed ; i.e. , the tunneling and the interlevel terms are set to zero , such that the system starts as a product state of eigenstates of each subsystem . in particular",
    ", we choose a set of initial states corresponding to all possible fock state configurations @xmath37 .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath38 of the postquench hamiltonian @xmath1 with eigenvalues @xmath39 can be expressed in terms of the fock basis , @xmath40 this expansion is similar to how the mean - field or unperturbed ( in our case uncoupled ) basis is physically motivated in studies related to chaotic eigenstates and its connection to thermalization of isolated systems @xcite .",
    "we do a sudden quench by turning on the tunneling and the interlevel coefficients .",
    "the wavefunction unitarily evolves in time according to @xmath41 for brevity , we refer to the mean energy , which is conserved during the dynamics , @xmath42 as simply the initial energy of the system .    for the postquench hamiltonian , the barrier height is chosen to be @xmath43 with width @xmath44 , where the harmonic oscillator length is @xmath45 .",

    "for this parameter space of the trap , the coefficients in the hamiltonian are @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",
    "we use exact diagonalization to obtain the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors expressed in the fock basis . to this end",
    ", we obtain the @xmath54 hamiltonian matrix in the fock basis where the size of the hilbert space is @xmath55 .",
    "alternatively , the time evolution of the wave function can be calculated from the time - evolving expansion coefficients , @xmath56 where @xmath57 spans all possible fock state configurations of the system .",
    "temporal evolution of the expansion coefficients is computed using standard numerical integrator , e.g. , seventh- or eighth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "an interesting question for finite quantum systems is the relevance of chaoticity of the hamiltonian in the study of thermalization @xcite .",
    "it was conjectured using a system of one - dimensional lattice with spin-@xmath58 , that the occurrence of thermalization depends only on the level of delocalization of initial states @xcite . furthermore",
    ", this condition has been shown to be sufficient for initial states close to the middle of the spectrum irrespective of integrability ( or chaoticity ) in both prequench and postquench hamiltonian .",
    "the level statistics of a chaotic hamiltonian was found to possess similar spectral properties as random matrices @xcite .",
    "one common measure of level statistics is the level spacing distribution , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the set of eigenenergies in ascending order @xcite . in a hamiltonian with time - reversal symmetry ,",
    "the chaotic regime is identified by a level spacing distribution similar to the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite .",
    "the connection between nonintegrability and a goe - like spectral behavior was pointed out in various works such as refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "integrable models are expected to have a poissonian level spacing distribution as demonstrated in refs .",

    "there is parity or reflection symmetry about the center of the double - well system . in order to avoid mixing eigenenergies from different symmetry sector , we separate the eigenenergies according to its parity , i.e. , even or odd eigenvectors in the fock basis .",
    "we do this by constructing eigenstates with well - defined parity in fock space @xcite . for the analysis of spectral statistics presented in this section , we numerically diagonalize the hamiltonian in the well - defined parity basis .",
    "we denote the reflection operator , which exchanges the fock state from left to right or vice versa as @xmath69 .",
    "then , we use a set of basis states given by : @xmath70    the distribution of the ratio of adjacent energy gaps @xmath64 for the even - parity sector is illustrated in fig .",
    "first , we analyze the spectral statistics of the full spectrum .",
    "notice how @xmath66 increases with the interaction strength before reaching its maximum around @xmath71 .",
    "it then decreases as you further increase the interaction strength .",
    "perhaps more interesting , the mean value of @xmath21 becomes smaller than the poisson distribution @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "this level clustering can be explained by the appearance of quasidegenerate eigenvectors ( in each symmetry sector ) when the interaction terms @xmath36 become sufficiently larger than the tunneling terms @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "specifically , these quasidegenerate pairs appear as high - lying excited states of the system .",
    "nevertheless , our results for the distribution of the ratio of consecutive level gaps imply that the postquench hamiltonian is nonchaotic in the chosen parameter space of the trap .",
    "even though the final hamiltonian is nonintegrable , the spectral statistics of the final hamiltonian is actually closer to the poisson distribution than the goe for the interaction strengths considered here .",
    "this indicates that the system is still close to an integrable point after the quench .    in the following section ,",
    "we demonstrate that thermalization is still viable , in the context of the eth , for the nonchaotic hamiltonian considered here .",
    "we also argue later that the presence of quasidegeneracies in the spectrum has important implications for the process of relaxation in the system .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble can describe the long - time averages if the requirements of the eth are satisfied . specifically , the diagonal ensemble prediction for a local operator @xmath75 will be close to a value predicted by a thermal or microcanonical ensemble if the eev is a smooth function of @xmath39 .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled if the vertical width of the eev at a chosen energy is small @xcite .",
    "we now calculate the eigenstate expectation values of the mode occupation number , @xmath76 , and check how they are distributed in the eigenenergies of the system for different interaction strengths .",
    "first , we consider the integrable limit of uncoupled bose - hubbard dimers when the interlevel coupling is absent , @xmath33 . we plot in fig .",
    "[ eev1](a ) the eev of the dimer with the lower on - site energy while fig .",
    "[ eev1](b ) shows the eev of the dimer with higher on - site energy .",
    "the overall structure of the distribution of eev appears similar in both dimers .",
    "that is , the expectation values of the mode occupation seemingly appear separated in flat bands , which then prohibits the eev from being a smooth function of the energy .",
    "physically , this is a direct consequence of @xmath77 .",
    "there is large range of possible eev at a given energy @xmath39 and hence thermalization must be absent in this limit .",
    "+   +    we plot the distribution of eev for different interaction strengths @xmath78 and finite integrability breaking @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ eev2 ] . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the distribution of eev is still regular and structured similar to the integrable case . even though the eev starts to clump together , separated bands are still noticeable , especially in low energies .",
    "the behavior of the distribution of eev , in particular its smoothness , improves as the interaction strength is increased from @xmath71 to @xmath80 . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the vertical width of the distribution of eev in the lower half of the spectrum is narrower than that in the remaining half .",
    "note , however , that eigenstates that are very close to the ground - state energy will always violate the eth , at least for interactions considered here , since the distribution is quite sparse in this region .",
    "this implies the absence of thermalization for initial energies close to the ground state .",
    "we point out that relaxation close to an infinite temperature state can be considered as a borderline case for which the eth is still satisfied , as seen from the solid vertical line in figs .",
    "[ eev2](e ) and [ eev2](f ) .     for different interaction strengths .",
    "]    a more quantitative description of the smoothness of the eev can be drawn from the distribution of gaps between consecutive eev @xcite , @xmath82 if eev is a smooth function of the eigenenergies , the distribution of @xmath83 denoted by @xmath84 will be sharply peaked near @xmath85 .",
    "accordingly , the width of @xmath84 decreases as the distribution of eev smoothens .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ eev2 ] that the eth works only for the bulk of the spectrum , i.e. , in the lower half of the spectrum .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we consider only a part of the full spectrum by removing the lowest @xmath86 and the highest @xmath87 of the eigenstates . in fig .",
    "[ eigdist ] , we plot @xmath84 for the rescaled occupation number in the lower mode of the left well @xmath88 .",
    "as we decrease the interaction strength , the distribution of @xmath83 broadens and the peak decreases .",
    "this is consistent with the qualitative picture presented in fig .",
    "[ eev2 ] .",
    "our results in this section suggest that despite the final hamiltonian being near integrability , the fact that it is still nonintegrable permits the fulfillment of the eth but not for all eigenstates .",
    "therefore , the condition for an initial state to properly thermalize will largely depend on which part of the spectrum the energy of an initial state is located .",
    "this is indeed the case , as we see later .",
    "we are interested in the relaxation dynamics if the system starts out as a product state of each mode . at long times , local operators in the system",
    "are expected to fluctuate around the mean value predicted by the diagonal ensemble @xmath89 where @xmath90 .",
    "clearly , the diagonal ensemble will depend on the initial state through @xmath91 . on the other hand ,",
    "the microcanonical average depends only on the initial energy and for finite system will also be a function of the energy window @xmath12 .",
    "the energy window is chosen such that it is small enough to approximate the mean energy of the system but still large enough to contain significant number of eigenstates .",
    "the appropriate microcanonical prediction of a local operator is obtained by averaging over all eigenstates within a small window of energy @xmath92 $ ] @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the initial energy of the system and @xmath95 corresponds to the number of eigenstates within the chosen window .    .",
    "]    normally , for every initial state , one has to first calculate @xmath96 over a range of @xmath12 and then choose @xmath12 that best approximates @xmath13 . here , in order to ease up on computational expense , we simply fix the energy window by choosing @xmath97 .",
    "although we checked that the microcanonical averages obtained this way are still weakly dependent on other choices of @xmath12 , to keep track of how close the microcanonical energy is to the energy of the system , we define the relative deviation @xmath98 the plot presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc ] , which shows the relative deviations of microcanonical averages in the case @xmath81 , underpins our choice of @xmath12 .",
    "the postquench hamiltonian eq . has parity or reflection symmetry about the center of the trap and so a thermalized state is expected to respect this symmetry .",
    "that is , the stationary properties in the left well must be the same as those in the right well .",
    "this is indeed the case for both the microcanonical and the diagonal ensemble predictions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : diag1 ] and [ fig : diag2 ] . in each plot , both ensemble averages in the left well are sitting on top of the corresponding values in the right well .",

    "[ fig : diag1 ] and [ fig : diag2 ] , we compare the microcanonical and the diagonal ensemble values calculated using eqs .   and , respectively , for all initial fock state configurations .",
    "similar to the distribution of the eev , thermalization is only viable if the distribution of the diagonal ensemble averages is smooth and monotonous across the range of possible initial energies .",
    "this is an alternative way of describing another signature of thermalization , which is the independence of the equilibrium state on the details of initial states .",
    "the results shown in figs .  [ fig : diag1 ] and [ fig : diag2 ] are consistent with the prediction of thermalization in the context of the eth as discussed in sec .",

    "recall that in figs .",
    "[ eev2](a ) and [ eev2](b ) , the vertical width of the eev is large for @xmath71 .",

    "thus , we conjecture that the presence of quasidegeneracies led to the prethermalization observed in the system .",
    "moreover , the width of the energy shell restricts the connectivity among the @xmath151 such that only the eigenenergies near an initial energy will contribute significantly to the relaxation dynamics .",
    "for this reason , initial states in the low - energy sector are unaffected by the quasidegeneracies in the high - energy sector and we only find fast and single - stage relaxation for such initial states [ see figs .",

    "most of the quasidegeneracies are situated in the high - energy sector .",
    "in addition to this , the energy difference can reach as low as @xmath164 in this sector , which is several orders of magnitude lower than the other sectors .",

    "these results allowed us to extend the scope of the main conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite to include chaotic initial states away from the middle of the spectrum that thermalize under time evolution of a nonchaotic hamiltonian .",
    "using generic initial product states , we found that the system may exhibit thermalization in the sense that the exact time evolution of local operators relax to the diagonal ensemble predictions and these values are close to corresponding gibbs ensemble predictions .",
    "in particular , we demonstrated that the mode occupation numbers of certain initial states would dynamically approach the diagonal ensemble averages .",
    "the energy of such initial state is within the range of energy for which initial states are delocalized and the eth is valid .",

    "one possible direction of future work is a careful study on how finite - size effects may affect the phenomenon observed in this work including the emergence of prethermalization and the behavior of the eev as the size of the system is increased .",
