    "we will analyse the denz04 data as if it comprised the entire @xmath0 elastic - scattering database at low energies ; this way , a possible failure when testing the degree of applicability of our psa to these data can not be blamed on other experimental data .",

    "we will first investigate the self - consistency of the @xmath1 measurements on the basis of suitable low - energy parameterisations of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave @xmath5-matrix elements ; the most recent values of any constants , which are used in the parameterisation of these quantities , may be found in ref .",

    "finally , the scale factors for free floating @xmath14 ( which we will use in section [ sec : reproduction ] , when investigating the absolute normalisation of the denz04 data sets using the zuas12 solution as reference ) are obtained via eq .",
    "( 5 ) ; their total uncertainty @xmath15 has been defined at the end of section 2.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one statistical test will be performed for each data set , the one involving its contribution @xmath13 to the overall @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding p - value will be evaluated on the basis of @xmath13 and number of degrees of freedom of the data set ( hereafter , the acronym dof will stand for ` degree(s ) of freedom ' , whereas ndf will denote the ` number of dof ' ) ; for a data set with @xmath16 data points ( none of which is an outlier ) , ndf is equal to @xmath16 . the p - value for each data set will be compared to the confidence level @xmath17 for the acceptance of the null hypothesis ( implying no statistically - significant effects ) .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is fixed to the equivalent of a @xmath18 effect in the normal distribution , corresponding to about @xmath19 .    to facilitate the repetitive use of the full description of the databases , we adhere to the following notation : db@xmath20 for the @xmath1 database ; db@xmath21 for the @xmath2 elastic - scattering database ; db@xmath22 for the combined @xmath0 elastic - scattering databases .",
    "the denz04 db@xmath20 consists of @xmath23 data points , acquired at five energies between @xmath24 and @xmath25 mev .",
    "two sets of values are available at @xmath25 mev : one was taken at the same conditions as the data at the lower energies , whereas another was obtained with the target rotated by @xmath26 ; similarly to the notation in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will identify the data set corresponding to the rotated target via the label ` ( rot . ) ' .",
    "technically , the denz04 @xmath1 data must be assigned to only @xmath27 data sets @xcite .",
    "however , the measurements have been assigned to a total of @xmath28 data sets in the said database @xcite , after splitting each data set ( except at @xmath24 mev ) into three parts : forward - angle ( @xmath29 ) , medium - angle ( @xmath30 ) , and backward - angle ( @xmath31 ) ; @xmath32 denotes the centre - of - mass ( cm ) scattering angle .",
    "the @xmath24 mev data do not cover scattering angles above @xmath33 ; therefore , the original data set has been split into two segments .",
    "some justification for this splitting of the original data sets may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and rests on the variation of the event - selection algorithm with the scattering - angle interval .",
    "the essential point is that a coincidence measurement ( i.e. , the simultaneous detection of both the scattered pion and proton ) , enabling the vertex reconstruction at ` medium ' scattering - angle values , can not be performed in the cases of very - forward and very - backward scattering at low energies ; as a result , only the scattered pion had been detected in very - forward scattering , and only the scattered proton in very - backward scattering .",
    "although we have analysed the denz04 data also the way the chaos collaboration appears to suggest ( i.e. , by assigning the measurements for each reaction to only @xmath27 data sets ) , the results of our analysis clearly favour the splitting of the data sets into segments the way this is done in the said database .",
    "we will give the results of the optimisation only in the case of the split @xmath1 data sets .",
    "the assignment of the measurements to @xmath28 data sets enables the determination of the scale factors @xmath12 from data which are more ` localised ' ( in terms of the scattering angle ) and , as such , it implies a more favourable treatment of the data .",
    "evidently , the appearance of any problems in case of the assignment of the data to @xmath28 data sets can only be exacerbated if only @xmath27 data sets are used .",
    "the denz04 db@xmath21 comprises @xmath34 data points , taken at the same five beam energies of the denz04 db@xmath20 ; similarly to @xmath1 , two sets of dcs values have been acquired at @xmath25 mev .",
    "in said , the measurements have been assigned to @xmath35 data sets ; we will do the same in the optimisation phase .",
    "the final normalisation uncertainties reported by the chaos collaboration @xcite are as follows : @xmath36 at the three lowest energies and @xmath37 for the @xmath25 mev data sets .",
    "asymmetric uncertainties have been given for the @xmath38 mev data sets ( @xmath39 ) ; unable to treat asymmetric uncertainties in our software , we have decided to use the normalisation uncertainty of @xmath37 ( average of the two absolute values ) for the @xmath38 mev data  .",
    "the said output for the denz04 @xmath1 data also contains the contribution of these data sets to their overall @xmath11 value . according to their results , the contribution of the @xmath40 data points   mev medium - angle data set . ] of the denz04 @xmath1 data to",
    "the overall @xmath11 is very large ( @xmath41 units ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath11 value for the denz04 @xmath2 elastic - scattering data is only slightly better ( @xmath42 for @xmath34 data points ) . on the basis of these numbers ,",
    "it is evident that the wi08 phase - shift solution yields a statistically - poor reproduction of the denz04 data .",
    "the parameterisation of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave @xmath5-matrix elements for the low - energy @xmath1 scattering may be found in section 3.1 of ref .",
    "the optimal values of the corresponding seven parameters ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 ) are obtained via the minimisation of the @xmath11 function ( see section 2.2 of ref .",
    "we will apply the same acceptance criteria to the denz04 measurements which were applied to the data in the zuas12 psa .",
    "the results of the optimisation procedure are shown in table [ tab : pi+p ] . since",
    "seven parameters are used to generate the fitted values , the ndf in the first fit to the denz04 db@xmath20 was @xmath50 ; the minimum value of @xmath11 was @xmath51 . for the truncated denz04 db@xmath20 ,",

    "the details on the truncated denz04 db@xmath20 , as obtained from the final fit , are given in table [ tab : dbpi+p ] .",
    "the @xmath54 amplitudes were fixed from the final fit to the truncated denz04 db@xmath20 and were imported into the analysis of the denz04 db@xmath21 .",
    "the parameterisation of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave @xmath55 @xmath5-matrix elements , suitable for the low - energy @xmath2 elastic scattering , may be found in section 3.2 of ref .",
    "seven new parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 ) are introduced at this stage .",
    "we present the steps in the process of removing outliers from the denz04 db@xmath21 in table [ tab : pi - p ] ; only three data points had to be removed .",
    "the final result for @xmath63 , obtained from the data , was around @xmath64 , a value which differs by a factor of @xmath65 from the result @xmath66 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath67 denotes the mass of the charged pion ) ; the @xmath63 value of ref .",
    "@xcite roughly agrees with the result obtained from the pionic - hydrogen data .",
    "we traced this discrepancy to the very unusual final values of the parameters entering the modelling of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave @xmath5-matrix elements for the @xmath1 reaction ( i.e. , the values which fixed the @xmath54 amplitudes in the case of the fits to the denz04 db@xmath21 ) .",
    "the details on each data set of the truncated denz04 db@xmath21 , as obtained from the final fit , are given in table [ tab : dbpi - p ] .      in order to give the two elastic - scattering reactions equal weight , we multiplied @xmath68 for each @xmath1 data set by @xmath69 and for each @xmath2 elastic - scattering data set by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 represent the ndf in the two databases ; we then added these quantities for all the data sets to obtain the overall @xmath11 value .",
    "the application of these ` global ' weights for the two reactions was made as a matter of principle ; given the proximity of the @xmath71 and @xmath72 values in the case of the denz04 data , the effect of this weighting on our results is very small .",
    "the common fit to the truncated denz04 db@xmath22 was subsequently performed , using @xmath73 parameters .",
    "this step was taken in order to examine whether any additional points ( or data sets ) had to be removed ; none were identified .",
    "the common fit to the data yielded a @xmath11 value of @xmath74 for @xmath75 dof in the fit .",
    "so far in this paper , we have used standard low - energy parameterisations of the @xmath6 amplitudes in terms of the pion cm kinetic energy .",
    "we will now use the eth model which is based on feynman diagrams .",
    "details on the model , as well as on its seven parameters ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 ) may be obtained from refs .  @xcite .",
    "this model was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and was developed to its final form by the mid 1990s .",
    "the common fit of the eth model to the truncated denz04 db@xmath22 yielded a @xmath11 value of @xmath83 for @xmath84 dof in the fit .",
    "all results for the parameters of the eth model turned out to be far from their ` established ' values . at the same time , the numerical evaluation of the correlation ( hessian ) matrix failed and the positivity had to be enforced by the minuit software library @xcite ( which we exclusively used in the optimisation ) ; hence , the uncertainties of the fit parameters could not be obtained .",
    "our results for the seven model parameters have shown good stability over the years , from the period when the fits were performed to old , outdated phase shifts to the present times when the fits are made directly to the contents of the low - energy @xmath6 database .",
    "the database itself has also changed significantly over the last two decades . in any case , it is fair to say that , no matter which data were fitted to , the results for the model parameters always came out within a reasonable interval of values ; this had been the case even when obvious outliers ( e.g. , the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite ) were included in our database ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the results for the model parameters , obtained from the common fit to the truncated denz04 db@xmath22 , are very odd . evidently ,",
    "for whichever reasons , the parameters drift away from their ` established ' values , to unreasonable ( or even unphysical ) ones .",
    "it is therefore meaningless to give ` optimal ' values for the model parameters .    despite the drift of the model parameters in the fit",
    ", we decided to determine the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave phase shifts with the model - parameter values obtained in the fit to the truncated denz04 db@xmath22 .",
    "the values of the denz04-based hadronic phase shifts ( and their overall tendency with increasing energy ) were found hard to accept .",
    "the final results for these phase shifts were far from the values established in refs .",
    "@xcite .      given all these problems",
    ", we decided to investigate the reproduction of the denz04 data on the basis of the zuas12 prediction .",
    "our goal in this part of the study is to identify the kinematical region(s ) in which the denz04 data are poorly reproduced ; if successful , we could pinpoint the origin of the problems we have encountered in the analysis of these measurements .",
    "the denz04 measurements , normalised to the corresponding zuas12 predictions , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pippe ] and [ fig : pimpe ] ; the outliers detailed in tables [ tab : pi+p ] and [ tab : pi - p ] are also contained in these figures . evidently , the angular distribution of the db@xmath20 disagrees with the shape obtained from the rest of the @xmath1 measurements in ref .",

    "the results are shown in table [ tab : reproduction1 ] .",
    "we notice that the overall @xmath11 values of the reproduction ( i.e. , the sums of the corresponding @xmath13 values given in the table for the two elastic - scattering reactions ) are : @xmath85 for @xmath2 elastic scattering ( @xmath34 data points ) and @xmath86 for @xmath1 ( @xmath23 data points ) .",

    "the dramatic decrease in the latter case indicates that the problems we have encountered in the analysis of the denz04 data are mainly due to the shape of the @xmath1 angular distributions .",
    "the decrease in the case of the @xmath2 elastic - scattering data ( i.e. , ` unsplit ' versus split data sets ) is very moderate , indicating considerably fewer problems with the denz04 db@xmath21 .",

    "are obtained ( corresponding to the two angular intervals of the measurements , i.e. , forward and medium / backward angles ) .",
    "we recollect that the @xmath11 results of ref .",

    "the @xmath97-test performed on the two @xmath2 elastic - scattering databases ( i.e. , on the truncated denz04 db@xmath21 and on the truncated zuas12 db@xmath21 ) results in the score value of @xmath98 for @xmath50 and @xmath95 dof , corresponding to the p - value of about @xmath99 . on the other hand , the @xmath97-test performed on the two corresponding @xmath1 databases results in the score value of @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath96 dof , resulting in a p - value of about @xmath102 .",
    "these two results are sufficient to substantiate our position that the denz04 measurements are not compatible with the rest of the low - energy @xmath6 database , as it emerged in our psa of ref .",

    "this implies that the seemingly - poor reproduction of the absolute normalisation of this data set on the basis of the zuas12 solution is less problematic than it appears to be .",
    "indeed , if the scale factor of @xmath103 of table [ tab : dbpi+p ] is applied to this data set , its resulting absolute normalisation will be compatible with our zuas12 solution . ] .",
    "all scale factors which are obtained at forward and medium angles ( except at @xmath38 mev ) show that the experimental data systematically exceed the ` theoretical ' values obtained on the basis of the optimal parameters of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies reach the @xmath104 level , with an average around @xmath105 .    on the other hand , the scale factors for free floating @xmath14 obtained in the case of the truncated denz04 db@xmath21 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfpim ] ) cluster well around the expectation value of @xmath106 .",

    "to summarise , the absolute normalisation of the denz04 db@xmath21 appears to be in good agreement with our zuas12 solution , as is the normalisation of the @xmath1 backward - angle data sets .",

    "the hadronic part of the @xmath6 interaction is dominant in backward scattering .",
    "the importance of the electromagnetic ( em ) contributions increases with decreasing scattering angle , finally culminating in the coulomb peak which governs the very - forward scattering .",
    "the conclusion we drew from the analysis of the denz04 db@xmath21 is that the eth model , along with the optimal values of the model parameters ( as obtained in the zuas12 solution ) and the known em contributions , accounts for the normalisation of the data successfully .",
    "the conclusion we drew from the analysis of the denz04 db@xmath20 is that the hadronic part of the interaction , as deduced on the basis of the zuas12 solution , is successful in reproducing the normalisation of the experimental data in the backward direction . due to the fact that the problems lie with the scale factors obtained at forward and medium scattering - angle values",
    ", the truncated denz04 db@xmath20 seems to indicate modifications in the em part of the @xmath6 interaction .",

    "( this comment also applies to the hadronic part of the amplitude when involving the eth model in the fits .",

    "see table @xmath108 of ref .",
    "@xcite and fig",

    "large effects in the normalisation of the denz04 @xmath1 data sets have been seen at forward and medium scattering angles , i.e. , in the region where the electromagnetic ( em ) effects are important .",

    "an explanation of the failure of the model to account for the denz04 data has been advanced on the basis of the interpretation of figs .",
    "[ fig : sfpip ] and [ fig : sfpim ] . given that there are no adjustable parameters in the em part of the @xmath6 interaction , the adjustable hadronic part attempts to compensate for unexpected features in the data .",
    "in an effort to model large differences in a region where the sensitivity of the dcs to the hadronic part of the interaction is expected to be low , the model parameters drift away from their ` established ' values , to unreasonable ones .    given all these problems , we are currently unable to include the experimental data of refs .",
