    "png135.9 + 55.9  ( also called sbs1150 + 599a ) is a recently discovered planetary nebula in the galactic halo @xcite whose oxygen abundance is reported to be extremely low , of order 1/100 of the solar value or less @xcite .",
    "this makes it , by one order of magnitude , the most oxygen - poor planetary nebula known so far .",
    "such a low oxygen abundance may be either genuine and represent the oxygen abundance in the material from which the progenitor star formed , or it may be the result of mixing processes while the star was on the agb . although the presently available determinations of the ne / o ratio are discrepant by a factor of about 10 ( richer et al . 2002 and jacoby et al . 2002 ) , they indicate that , even in the case of conversion of o into ne , the original oxygen abundance of the progenitor of png135.9 + 55.9  is likely extremely low .    clearly , this unique object deserves a more detailed study to better define its nature .",
    "tovmassian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) speculated upon various scenarios for the formation of this planetary nebula .",
    "one of them assumed a progenitor star having formed out of infalling material .",
    "another invoked the existence of a close binary core . in this paper",
    "we focus on the information provided by new observations concerning the nature of the central star of png135.9 + 55.9 . a companion paper ( stasiska et al . in preparation ) will discuss new observational constraints on the chemical composition of this object .",
    "first , we acquired far - ultraviolet spectra of png135.9 + 55.9  using the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) .",
    "we also obtained a series of high signal - to - noise optical spectra of the nebula and its central star . from these observations",
    ", one can constrain the fundamental parameters of the central star .",
    "it is also possible to investigate whether there might be variability on short time scales .",
    "the most surprising result of our study is the discovery that the core of this planetary nebula is a short period , close binary with an unseen companion , probably a white dwarf .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the observations and the reduction procedure , both for the fuse and ground - based observations . in section 3",
    ", we describe the main spectral features of the object from the fuse and ground - based observations . in section 4",
    ", we present a stellar atmosphere analysis that allows us to infer the gravity of the ionizing star from the observed h  i absorption features and estimate parameters of the binary system . in section 5 , we present estimates of the reddening of png135.9 + 55.9  based upon the fuse data and in section 6 we estimate the distance and age of png135.9 + 55.9 . in section 7",
    ", we discuss the binary nature of the core and the masses of its components .",
    "finally , in section 8 , we summarize the main results of this study and present some prospects for future study .",
    "fuse is an orbiting observatory with the capability to obtain high resolution spectroscopy in the wavelength region between 900 and 1200 .",
    "it consists of four co - aligned telescopes optimized for far - uv wavelengths .",
    "the spherical , aberration - corrected , holographic diffraction gratings disperse light from four channels . two channels with sic coatings",
    "cover the 9051100region and two others with al+lif coatings detect the 10001187  range .",
    "an overview of the fuse mission has been given by @xcite .",
    "the observation of png135.9 + 55.9   ( i d # c034 ) was conducted through the lwrs aperture ( @xmath0 square ) on 2002 january 30 for a total exposure time of 30660s .",
    "the observation was composed of seven individual integrations of approximately 4200s each , simultaneous in all channels .",
    "these observations were among the first executed after the recovery from the failure of two reaction wheels in december 2001 .",
    "therefore , the pointing was not as good as was achieved before the accident or after the situation was taken under complete control",
    ". we have checked possible deviations during the observations .",
    "there was a systematic , quasi - sinusoidal pointing drift on an orbital time - scale .",
    "however , the maximum displacement is only 23 , which corresponds to a maximum shift of 0.026   ( i.e. , 7.7 km / s at 1000  ) , or about half a spectral resolution element .",
    "thus , it can hardly pose a problem , but the pointing itself ( centering in the aperture ) , which is difficult to verify , can introduce zero - point offsets of up to 0.15 .",
    "the pipeline reduction package calfuse 2.1.7 was used for the extraction of the spectra as well as reduction and calibration purposes .",
    "our examination of the spectra showed that the wavelength shifts between individual exposures , which are common for fuse data , never exceeded 1.5 pixels and were usually in the 0.1 - 0.5 pixel range .",
    "since the shifts were negligible , we used a non - standard processing wherein all 7 exposures were concatenated into one large photon list before pushing it through calfuse 2.1.7 .",
    "this permits a more reliable background model to be created , which is especially important for faint targets such as png135.9 + 55.9 , and also eliminates the need to cross - correlate and coadd exposures . the other important procedure that we used was to separate the night exposure ( ne ) from the total exposure of the object .",
    "the data are severely contaminated by the airglow lines arising form the illuminated atmosphere of the earth during day time @xcite . in order to eliminate the strong emission lines from the terrestrial airglow",
    ", we extracted photons obtained when the exposure was taken during orbital night .",
    "this decreased our exposure time by factor of 3 .",
    "we use both the total exposure and ne spectra to analyze the data of png135.9 + 55.9 .",
    "no event bursts or other unusually strong glitches common for fuse data were detected in the raw images or the photon arrival rate plots ( see the fuse instrument and data handbook edited by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the observations at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) were obtained on 2003 may 1 ut with the mos spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the u900 grism was used to observe the 34005300  spectral interval .",
    "a @xmath1 slit was used .",
    "coupled with the eev1 ccd , @xmath2 m pixels , the dispersion was 0.78 / pix and the resolution 3.03.5 , based upon the widths of arc lamp lines .",
    "a @xmath3 filter ( cfht filter # 1412 ) was used to center the central star of png135.9 + 55.9  in the slit .",
    "the spectra of png135.9 + 55.9  were obtained in pairs with the spectrograph slit set at the parallactic angle corresponding to the midpoint of the pair of spectra .",
    "this was done since the spectrograph rotation and object re - acquisition took a significant amount of time . for the observations of png135.9",
    "+ 55.9and the standard star bd+33@xmath42642 @xcite , the slit position angle was within @xmath5 of the parallactic angle at all times .",
    "seven 1800s exposures of png135.9 + 55.9  were obtained spanning the airmass range 1.302.65 .",
    "the observations of bd+33@xmath42642 were obtained using a @xmath6 slit .",
    "spectra of hg , ne , and ar lamps were obtained for wavelength calibration at the end of the night only .",
    "images of the flat field lamp were obtained through both slits to correct for pixel - to - pixel variations .",
    "bias images were also obtained in order to remove any two - dimensional structure in the bias level .",
    "the data were reduced using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software package ( specifically the specred package ) .",
    "the mean level of the overscan region was subtracted from each image .",
    "next , the average of the overscan - corrected bias images was subtracted from all object and flat field images to remove any two - dimensional bias structure .",
    "the flat field images were combined and then processed to divide out the shape of the flat field lamp .",
    "the resulting flat field was then divided into all object images .",
    "the spectra of png135.9 + 55.9  and the standard star were extracted to one - dimensional images , subtracting the sky contribution by defining sky apertures on both sides of the object spectra and interpolating between them with a straight line . the wavelength axis was calibrated using the spectra of the arc lamp . since the object",
    "was observed repeatedly over a large airmass interval , an empirical atmospheric extinction curve was derived from the data .",
    "this extinction curve turned out to be somewhat steeper than that given in the cfht observatory manual .",
    "the spectra were calibrated in flux using the observations of the standard star and the previous empirical atmospheric extinction curve .",
    "the individual spectra of png135.9 + 55.9  were completely calibrated before combining or further analyzing them .",
    "the fuse spectrum itself is an approximately flat continuum , with a mean level of about @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8  @xmath9  @xmath8 .",
    "there are many lines of interstellar ( is ) h@xmath10 .",
    "no emission lines could be seen except those that are definitely associated with terrestrial airglow .",
    "most of these lines disappear in the ne spectrum , with only the strongest lines of h  i  and o  i leaving residual emission peaks whose intensities are dramatically reduced compared to the all photon spectrum . since the systemic velocity of png135.9 + 55.9is @xmath11193 km / sec @xcite , there is no possible confusion between airglow emission lines and lines from the object . the fuse ne spectrum of png135.9 + 55.9  is presented in fig [ spec ] . on the whole , it is impressively featureless , particularly when compared with a large subset of fuv spectra of planetary nebulae from the fuse archives that we examined .",
    "this remarkable absence of features in the fuse spectrum of png135.9 + 55.9  is consistent with the very low metal abundances derived from the analysis of the pn .",
    "most of the absorption lines that are observed originate in the interstellar matter between us and the object .",
    "there are numerous lines of molecular and atomic hydrogen",
    ". their study can provide interesting constraints upon the distribution of h and h@xmath10 along the line of sight toward the object ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , we are mainly concerned with the physics of png135.9 + 55.9  itself in this paper and discuss only the impact of these interstellar lines upon our analysis of png135.9 + 55.9 .",
    "molecular hydrogen is a significant source of contamination when studying the spectral features of the underlying source .",
    "fortunately , the physics of absorption by molecular hydrogen is well understood and can be reliably modeled .",
    "absorption bands of interstellar molecular hydrogen arise from the photo - excitation of molecular hydrogen by the background continuum object , causing electrons in the ground electronic state to be excited into higher states of either the lyman or werner bands .",
    "the strength of these absorption lines is proportional to the molecular column density distribution within the ground electronic state s rotational ( @xmath12 ) and vibrational @xmath13 energy levels along a particular line - of - sight .",
    "we used the fuse simulator tool to model the fuse spectrum ( _ http://violet.pha.jhu.edu/~gak/fwebsim.html_ ) . in order to estimate the hydrogen column density",
    ", we used a flat spectrum of intensity @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8  @xmath9  @xmath8  and a variety of parameters for the foreground column densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen .",
    "later , we repeated this analysis with our derived model spectrum , described in the following sections , and obtained exactly the same results .",
    "a grid of values of neutral hydrogen column densities ranging from log @xmath14 = 20 to @xmath15 were investigated . for h@xmath16 ,",
    "the input values were log n(@xmath17 ) = 18 to 20 .",
    "the model uses voigt profiles to calculate the optical depth variation with wavelength for each line .",
    "line shapes reproducing the linear , flat , and square root portions of the curve - of - growth are controlled through the specification of the doppler parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the doppler parameter @xmath18 of line width was adopted equal to 10 km  s@xmath8 , as provided by default in the simulation tool .",
    "the modelled interstellar absorption shows a significant 0.2wavelength shift compared to the observed spectrum as estimated from cross - correlation . this shift is larger than expected for interstellar hydrogen absorption , e.g. , @xcite did not measure velocities in excess of 30km / s for interstellar lines from atomic species in a sample of white dwarfs with high resolution hst uv spectra . even considering the much larger distance to png135.9 + 55.9  compared to that sample",
    ", it is unlikely that the entire wavelength shift is due to high velocity clouds along this line of sight .",
    "at least half of the shift in the fuse spectrum of png135.9 + 55.9  ( 0.2   corresponds to approximately 60 km / sec ) is probably caused by imperfect centering of the central star in the lwrs aperture of fuse .",
    "this is a well - known problem that can cause shifts of the wavelength scale .",
    "we adopted the view that the radial velocity shift of the h@xmath10 features is caused by this instrumental effect and corrected the wavelength scale for further fitting of the photospheric line profile .",
    "the h@xmath10 column density strongly affects the profiles of the h@xmath10 lines , whereas the impact of the neutral hydrogen column density is less significant . in fig .",
    "[ h21 ] simulated spectra with different hydrogen ( hi , h@xmath10 ) column densities are presented .",
    "two spectral regions are shown .",
    "the first is around @xmath19 , where the werner series has strong lines , while the other is around @xmath20 , with prominent h@xmath10 lines of the lyman series . in both regions , even without doing a @xmath21 fit , it is obvious that values of log @xmath22 of 18 and 20 dex are far from fitting the observed line profiles and intensities , while @xmath23 dex provides a good fit . for neutral hydrogen ,",
    "the choice of the best fit is not so obvious .",
    "another useful web tool allows one to calculate the column density depending upon the direction in the galaxy based upon the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* _ http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/tools/w3nh/w3nh.pl_ ) .",
    "according to this calculation , the expected neutral hydrogen column density is @xmath24 in the direction of png135.9 + 55.9 .",
    "this roughly corresponds to the modelled value of log @xmath14 = 20.3 , which is shown in the second panel from the bottom in fig .",
    "[ h21 ] . however a higher value of @xmath25 seems to be an equally good fit .",
    "we suspect that the column density toward png135.9 + 55.9  may be slightly higher than 20.3 dex , as follows also from the analysis of absorbed flux in the uv .",
    "this will be discussed in detail below in sect .",
    "5 .        besides the numerous h@xmath10 lines of the werner and lyman series",
    ", there is a large number of absorption lines from o  i , n  i , n  ii , n  iii and fe  ii that are also due to the intervening interstellar medium .",
    "these lines are commonly encountered during fuse observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , most importantly , their wavelengths indicate that they are not related to our object .",
    "the fact that these lines are numerous and strong is in agreement with the previously deduced large distance to the object and its location in the galactic halo ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also sect .",
    "the only spectral feature in the fuse spectrum firmly identified to arise in our object , apart from the continuum , is the relatively broad absorption from ly@xmath26 that we attribute to the central star .",
    "the only possible emission feature from the nebula itself is a small emission peak inside the ly@xmath26 absorption .",
    "as mentioned above , we expect the lines from the central star to be doppler shifted to the blue by the heliocentric systemic velocity of the nebula , -193.3",
    "km s@xmath8 @xcite",
    ". the nebular lines may appear to be blue - shifted somewhat more , to as much as -205 km s@xmath8 , because the nebular emission consists of two components with the blue - shifted component being the stronger of the two @xcite .",
    "the portion of the all photon spectrum around ly@xmath26 is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : lyfit ] along with the models that were fit to it ( described below ) .",
    "the profile of the absorption feature blueward of the vacuum wavelength position of ly@xmath26 , indicated by a strong airglow line , is extremely complicated .",
    "first , the absorption line is saturated .",
    "second , the red wing is contaminated by the airglow emission whose profile itself is complicated by a small glitch on the blue wing .",
    "third , there is residual emission from the o  i airglow line further to the red .",
    "fourth , there are several strong components of interstellar h@xmath10 lyman lines inside the stellar absorption line . finally , inside the absorption feature sits an emission peak that we interpret as nebular he  ii 6 - 2 @xmath27 emission ( see below ) superposed upon the h  i ly@xmath26 absorption feature from the central star .",
    "the emission line that we identify as he  ii has a measured wavelength of 1024.57  .",
    "this coincides exactly with the position of he  ii @xmath27 at a radial velocity of -205 km s@xmath8 .",
    "we corrected the line profile in the all photon spectrum , applying the model of interstellar absorption with the parameters estimated in the previous section ( log @xmath14 = 20.3 and @xmath22 = 19 ) .",
    "the residual spectrum still shows broad photospheric ly@xmath26 absorption as well as emission at the position of he  ii line . although the strength of the absorption feature corresponding to ly@xmath26 depends upon the parameters adopted for interstellar hydrogen in the model , it is both expected and present in the spectrum",
    "we are less confident regarding the he  ii emission feature , because it is located in a gap between two strong interstellar lines and can be easily confused with the residual intervening continuum .",
    "however this supposed emission line protrudes more than can be accounted for by the models , even if column densities exceeding @xmath28 are considered .",
    "if this is the case , then the upper limit to the flux from the he  ii @xmath27 is @xmath29  erg  @xmath9  s@xmath8 , according to the model fit that is described in sect .",
    "4.2 .    in the optical range",
    ", we discovered signatures of the central object in the form of absorption lines at the wavelengths of hydrogen and helium lines .",
    "these features were not previously noted because our new spectra have higher s / n ( by a factor of 3 ) and higher spectral resolution than all of our previous spectra . as an experiment",
    ", we degraded our new cfht spectra to the resolution that we used before , and the absorption features almost disappeared , leaving marginal traces only in higher members of the balmer series .",
    "our previous observations also used a wider slit , substantially increasing the nebular contribution and possibly widening the emission lines .",
    "as detailed in the table  [ rvtbl ] , we obtained seven optical spectra of png135.9 + 55.9  during one night .",
    "the observations were primarily designed to obtain deep spectrophotometric data in far optical uv for study of ne ions located there and other possible faint emission lines from the nebula in the integrated spectrum .",
    "these will be discussed in a subsequent publication concerning the nebular characteristics . here",
    "we concentrate on the features due to the central star .",
    "even a simple eye inspection of the co - added spectrum immediately attracted our attention to the dips around higher balmer series lines , which are clearly not centered on the emission lines .",
    "an analysis of the individual spectra revealed that the center of the absorption component varies , indicating large radial velocity shifts .    in principle , our observing technique and equipment are not ideal for detecting radial velocity variations . the use of a grism spectrograph , with a nonlinear dispersion , the large range of telescope inclination angles spanned by the observations , and the variable slit angle combined to scatter the absolute zero point of the wavelength scale among the spectra by up to 10 .",
    "however , all of our measurements of absorption components in the central star spectrum that are relevant to this study where made relative to corresponding nebular emission line components , which effectively eliminates possible problems .",
    "initial estimates of the radial velocities ( rvs ) were obtained by de - blending the line profiles with the fit routines of the gnuplot program .",
    "a gaussian profile was assumed for the emission component ( from the nebula ) .",
    "a voigt profile was taken for the absorption component , as it is better suited to fit a broad white dwarf - like absorption component .",
    "we succeeded in separating the components for the lines where we had enough signal , enough continuum around the lines , and an absorption component sufficiently strong to be resolved .",
    "this concerns primarily h@xmath30 , h@xmath31 , and h@xmath32 , where de - blending worked fine for all seven spectra ( i.e. for different orbital phases ) , returning consistent parameters of the measured lines from one line to another and from spectrum to spectrum . to reduce the number of free parameters",
    ", we performed a simultaneous fit of all spectra .",
    "the fwhm of the gaussian used to fit the emission lines and the parameters of the lorentzian fit to the photospheric absorption were held fixed , because these values should remain constant , while all other parameters were allowed to vary from spectrum to spectrum .",
    "the imperfections of wavelength calibration were eliminated by measuring the radial velocities of the absorption components relative to their emission counterparts , which we suppose to be constant in general , and on such short time scale in particular , as is also evident from our previous observations @xcite .",
    "the corresponding measurements of the absorption components along with epochs of observation are presented in the second and sixth columns of table  [ rvtbl ] .",
    "clearly , the radial velocity variations of the absorption components of these three lines are consistent with each other , and vary strongly on a timescale of a few hours . before analyzing their time dependance , i.e. periodic nature ,",

    "it is very unlikely that the companion is a main sequence star , because we would then expect a strong reflection effect producing very strong emission lines from the irradiated hemisphere of the main sequence star . that these are not observed in the optical spectra indicates that the companion is most probably a white dwarf or a neutron star .    due to the short orbital period ( four hours or less )",
    "the system will merge in less than one gyr , if the companion is a compact star .",
    "if a companion mass exceeding @xmath127 can be confirmed , the total mass of the stellar binary core would exceed the chandrasekhar limit and this system would qualify as a potential progenitor of a type ia supernova .",
    "new observations , with shorter exposure times and longer time coverage , will be needed in order to establish a definitive orbital period and other parameters for the binary system .",

    "<S> we report fuse and new deep optical spectroscopic observations of png135.9 + 55.9 , the most oxygen - poor planetary nebula located in the galactic halo . </S>",
    "<S> these observations allow us to estimate the gravity of the central star by fitting the profile of the observed h  i absorption lines with nlte model atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> our best fit implies that the central star is still in a pre - white dwarf stage . </S>",
    "<S> we also find large variability of the radial velocities of the absorption component of the balmer lines on a timescale of hours . this is direct evidence that the nucleus of png135.9 + 55.9  is a close binary . </S>",
    "<S> the large semi - amplitude of the radial velocity variations and the probably short period suggest a massive compact companion , likely a white dwarf . </S>",
    "<S> although our orbital solutions are very preliminary , they indicate that the total mass of the system probably exceeds the chandrasekhar limit . </S>",
    "<S> if confirmed , this would make this binary the potential progenitor of a type ia supernova . </S>"
