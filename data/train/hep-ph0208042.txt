    "the measurements are in a good agreement apart from @xmath7 where the @xmath8 results of ccfr are systematically lower . in contrast to ccfr the nutev experiment uses very clean @xmath9 and @xmath8 beams provided by a sign selected quadrupole train where the charge of the parent @xmath10 of the neutrinos can be selected .",

    "the helium-3 and nitrogen data were already published  @xcite .",
    "recently , those data were found to suffer from an a - dependent tracking efficiency of the hermes spectrometer , which was not recognised in the previous analysis .",

    "the zeus - o fit was made using the same form of parton parametrization as the zeus - s global fit .",
    "for the global fits , parametrization dependence is not severe since , for example , the valence shapes are strongly constrained across all @xmath19 by the ccfr @xmath53 data , and the @xmath84 distribution is constrained by @xmath85 target data .",

    ".      there has been significant progress in this area , and we were given a summary by s.  capitani @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to compute structure functions directly on the lattice because the parton distributions are defined on the light cone , while lattice simulations are done in euclidean space .",
    "however , one can use the operator product expansion and calculate moments .",
    "the main effort has been in the calculation of 1st , 2nd and 3rd moments of nonsinglet distributions , both for unpolarized and polarized structure functions .",
    "a reason for only calculating nonsinglet quantities is due to the difficulty in computing disconnected diagrams ( i.e. , connected only by gluon lines ) due to the expense in computer time .",
    "nonsinglet quantities are insensitive to such diagrams .",
    "one of the main improvements has been the first calculations without using the quenching approximation .",
    "this has shown that , for nonsinglet quantities at least , the quenched approximation is indeed very good .",
    "there have also been improvements in the perturbative renormalization factors required to translate the results on the lattice to a particular continuum renormalization scheme ( e.g @xmath93 ) . in order to obtain the final results on the lattice",
    "it is ultimately necessary to perform chiral and continuum extrapolations , using a fit formula @xmath94 , due to the finite lattice spacing @xmath95 and to the fact that one currently has a pion with mass @xmath96 .",
    "this appears to be well under control , but the results are disappointing  for the first moment of the @xmath97 distribution they find @xmath98 where the standard distributions give @xmath99 .",
    "the results for polarized distributions are more in agreement with experiment .",
    "it is thought that this discrepancy is due to the finite size of the lattice missing the effects of the pion cloud . from chiral perturbation theory one obtain terms @xmath100 .",
    "introducing an additional term in the extrapolation formula of the form @xmath101 can solve this problem , but only for @xmath102 a free parameter @xmath103 for various processes , destroying any predictive power .",
    "one needs lattices such that @xmath104 , which may be possible with computers within a couple of years .",
    "it would also be desirable to investigate the pion cloud effects by doing simulations with larger physical volumes .",
    "finally , preliminary investigates of higher twist moments have been performed , giving results which are surprisingly small .",
    "there was a lot of emphasis on the region of small @xmath19 and low @xmath1 where the gluon density is expected to saturate .",
    "recently a great deal of interest has focused on the gbw saturation model @xcite . in this",
    "one factorizes deep inelastic scattering into the fluctuation of the virtual photon into a dipole pair and the dipole - proton cross - section .",
    "the former is calculable at lo and the latter is modelled in the form @xmath105\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the dipole size and @xmath107 .",
    "this then saturates at large @xmath106 and low @xmath19 and predicts geometric scaling , i.e that the structure functions are functions of @xmath108 alone . for @xmath109",
    "this model could be made to fit data well , and the procedure could then predict the total diffractive cross - section . we had a presentation from n.  timneanu on an extension of this type of approach to two photon physics @xcite . using a number of sensible extensions of the dipole - proton cross - section to model the dipole - dipole cross - section he demonstrated that a good fit to existing data on photon - photon cross - sections is obtained for both real and virtual photons .",
    "however , this data is not very precise , and in particular , can not distinguish between the different extensions .",
    "however , the new more accurate hera data on proton structure functions presented at this workshop is very precise and forces the simple saturation model to be modified , e.g. , the effective power @xmath25 in @xmath110 is accurately measured to run with @xmath1 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : lowq2 ] and fig .",
    "[ lambda ] ) whereas it saturates at moderate @xmath1 in the simplistic saturation model . in order to rectify this",

    "this can improve the fit considerably , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gbwfig ] . however , it moves one away from the original principles somewhat , and geometric scaling is violated .",
    "there are two alternative formulations in @xcite ( somewhere between the two is likely to be most realistic ) , both moving the saturation scale to lower @xmath19 and @xmath1 . including charm quarks rather than only 3 light flavours in the original model ( hardly optional since charm contributes over @xmath115 of the structure function in some regions ) also moved the saturation scale down an order of magnitude in @xmath19 . if this is also true for the modified model it implies that for @xmath116 saturation sets in only for @xmath117 in structure functions .     as a function of @xmath1 - the original saturation model ( dashed line ) and the improved model ( dotted line).,width=340 ]    we also had some other talks on saturation in qcd , discussing the solutions to the nonlinear equations describing qcd at high parton density and adding support to the type of models considered above .",
    "we had a review of this subject by l.  mclerran @xcite ( which will be discussed in the summary of the diffractive session ) .",
    "we also had a presentation by a.  freund which outlined some specific points @xcite .",
    "he told us that `` colour glass condensate '' simply means that in qcd ( colour ) at high energies , fields slowly evolve relative to natural scales ( glass ) and the phase - space density saturates ( condensate ) .",
    "hence , at high energies , but at scales high enough that perturbative qcd applies , one can write a renormalization group equation in @xmath19 in terms of suitable variables @xcite .",
    "this results in a fokker - plank equation which is nonlinear , but which one can use known techniques to solve . implementing a single input condition one obtains a solution ( for fixed @xmath118 ) of the general form @xmath119 where @xmath120 , which fits the data well and is similar to geometric scaling .",
    "this has also been applied to nuclear structure functions with successful results , and where it is found that the scaling variable is @xmath121 , where @xmath122 rather than the naively expected @xmath123 .",
    "hence , the first principle solutions in the colour - glass - condensate approach support the saturation models , implying a similar type of scaling . corrections to this scaling have been estimated . however , there are further improvements to be made , e.g. a full treatment of running coupling , and it is intriguing that geometric scaling should work so well when the charm quark contribution is ignored , despite the fact that it contributes a great deal to the structure function , and should lead to violation of any geometric type scaling",
    ".      this should be applicable at high energies at scales where perturbation theory holds but high density effects are minimal .",
    "there have been a number of improvements in this field .",
    "one of these is in the monte carlos based on @xmath3-factorization .",
    "h.  jung showed that there has been significant progress in correcting previous shortcomings in the cascade monte carlo @xcite , both in the treatment of the scale in the running of the coupling and in the inclusion of the non - singular terms in the @xmath124 gluon - gluon splitting function @xcite .",
    "explicitly , in the original version the splitting function had the form @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the non - sudakov form factor .",
    "this misses the non - singular terms @xmath127 in the lo splitting function .",
    "since this is a negative contribution its omission leads to a bigger gluon at high and moderate @xmath19 .",
    "this has lead to the modification @xmath128 where @xmath129 , as well as changes to the form factors .",
    "unfortunately , although these modifications , or something similar , are necessary , the decreased positive contribution to the evolution at moderate @xmath19 actually leads to worse agreement with data for forward jets , and tevatron @xmath130 production , with the data showing an excess in both cases .",
    "there was also an alternative approach to @xmath3-factorization based monte carlos presented by g.  miu @xcite .",

    "agree well with standard distributions .",
    "while this need not be the case at small @xmath19 , where @xmath3-factorization and collinear factorization may well differ , it must be the case at higher @xmath19 , where a correctly modified monte carlo should not significantly alter the conventional results .",
    "a.  stasto talked on solutions to the lo bfkl equation with running coupling @xcite .",
    "she argued that if one calculates the purely perturbative contribution to the high - energy gluon green s function one obtains an expansion in @xmath131 which is reasonably well - behaved as long as @xmath132 ( beyond this the series diverges ) , and explicit results are known for this series @xcite .",
    "it was also demonstrated that the transition to the nonperturbative region is a sudden tunneling - like effect , rather than due to diffusion as is generally assumed @xcite .",

    "for example , mrst have used the approximate nnlo splitting functions in @xcite to perform global fits and make predictions at nnlo @xcite .",
    "this suggests that nnlo leads to a bigger correction even to the w cross - section at tevatron than the experimental error within nlo .",

    "additionally , detailed investigation of cuts on data @xcite suggest that the fits improve if the lowest @xmath1 and particularly lowest @xmath19 data are cut out , and the predictions for cross - sections with the new partons change .",
    "this suggests potentially large corrections to nlo dglap at low @xmath1 and low @xmath19 .      as outlined , there are various different approaches to calculating structure functions , and there has been real progress in some of these calculations , e.g. nnlo in the usual expansion in @xmath118 , in the colour glass model and in nlo corrections to bfkl impact factors .",
    "all the approaches are probably applicable in their own regime , and in some cases can be extrapolated with considerable success for surprising distances . however",
    ", this success may sometimes lead to unwarranted claims that one approach is actually particularly appropriate .",
    "there needs to be more real understanding of precisely where the regimes are and how they can be combined in order to produce the best overall theory with the maximum predictive power . in our opinion the best theory , particularly when one considers the predictive power for a wide range of processes over a range of different experiments ( hera , tevatron , nutev , lep , lhc ) is probably the collinear factorization theorem , but improved as much as possible by , for example , resummations at small and large @xmath19 , higher twist corrections , etc .",
    "clearly this will then require modification in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "this construction of the best complete , universally applicable theory is a difficult task , and help will be needed from even more precise and wide - ranging data .",
    "new precise results on structure functions across a wide range of @xmath1 , from @xmath141 to @xmath142 , have been presented this year .",
    "the data are now systematics rather than statistics limited such that qcd fits to extract parton distributions and @xmath143 have to consider correlated systematic errors .",
    "the precision of the data requires extension of the conventional formalism of nlo qcd , as embodied in the dglap formalism , and this challenge is being met as this formalism extended in various directions : to nnlo , to small @xmath19 , to high density and to the non - perturbative regime .          c.  adloff _ et al . _",
