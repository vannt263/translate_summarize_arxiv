    "in models of evolution of galaxies where the direct gas - dynamical computation is used , it is difficult to reach the resolution in space less than @xmath1 pc and resolution in time less than , say , @xmath2 yr due to computational cost .",
    "we can use only the phenomenological approach to describe the interstellar medium ( ism ) on scale @xmath3 pc and below .",
    "this means that we have to use an averaged description of interstellar medium .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a star formation model dealing with turbulent energy of ism and an averaged approach to take into account the structure of ism in model of dissipation of turbulent energy .",
    "the proposed models are able to explain the observable star formation pause in our galaxy corresponding to star ages from @xmath4 to @xmath5 gyr .",
    "the main factor which affects star formation is a gas density .",
    "however , it is clear that star formation can be suppressed by supernovae explosions by means of turbulent feedback .",
    "thus , the model star formation law must depend on density and on turbulent energy of gas .",
    "let us adopt the star formation law in kennicutt form @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the gas density , @xmath8 is the free - fall time , @xmath9 is the star formation efficiency ( the values are from @xmath10 @xcite to @xmath11 @xcite ) .",
    "it is commonly believed that the stars form from a dense and cool gas .",
    "it is possible to adopt this assumption in a simple manner . just let the star formation efficiency @xmath9 be the fraction of perturbations of density which are unstable by jeans criterion , assuming the masses of perturbations distributed in a power law : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the jeans mass @xcite depending on density and `` temperature '' @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the exponent of power distribution of mass of perturbations . it is necessary to explain the meaning of temperature in this expression .",
    "the temperature value averaged over all components of ism @xmath16k while the temperature of the gas in star forming regions is tens and units of kelvin .",
    "however , we can assume the local virial equilibrium between thermal and turbulent energy of gas , and the power law dependence of turbulent velocity dispersion on scale , so the value of the averaged turbulent energy will reflect the value of temperature and turbulent energy on small scales .",
    "after all substitutions the star formation law will be @xmath17 or , assuming the salpeter - like exponent @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the normalizing constant .",
    "it may be determined using the star formation law of tutukov @xcite . according to this law the star formation process",
    "is regulated by ionization and depends on gas density as @xmath21 this law has clear physical base and it works good in the single - zone model of evolution of galaxies @xcite . the average temperature of modern ism was chosen to be @xmath22 k ( though it s value does not affects significantly on the chemical abundance history of the galaxy in single - zone evolution model , see below ) , so the normalizing constant becomes @xmath23 @xmath24 k@xmath25 g@xmath26 s@xmath26 .",
    "the temperature @xmath14 used in the last formulae supposed to relate to maximal turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath27 as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath30 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "some star formation models with turbulent energy account had been offered earlier @xcite , but the model proposed in this paper has the advantage .",
    "this model based on jeans instability creterion so it can be extended for the case when the galaxy rotation , magnetic field or chemical composition is significant .",
    "in all numerical models of galaxy evolution , the ism in a computational cell presented as a solid brick of gas without any structure . however , the ism has complex turbulent behaviors which are needed to be allowed . in a simple approach",
    "the ism may be considered as a set of colliding clouds with different sizes and masses .",
    "the cloud mass probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath31 and density dependence on scale @xmath32 are observable @xcite and velocity - scale relation had examined by both observations @xcite and computations @xcite : @xmath33 here the scale @xmath34 is in range @xmath35 and values @xmath36 and @xmath37 are averages in an area of size @xmath38 .",
    "imagine that dissipation of turbulent energy occurs trough the collisions of clouds , subsequent contraction and heating by shock waves and radiation .",
    "it is obvious that the efficiency of dissipation will determine by relation of collision time to cooling time @xcite .",
    "the value of energy radiated away per unit time in this process is @xmath39    = \\left [      \\begin{array}{c }        \\text{collision } \\\\",
    "\\text{frequency }      \\end{array }    \\right ]   \\ ;    \\sum_{l_\\mathrm{min } \\leqslant",

    "the volume density of turbulent energy of clouds of sizes from @xmath34 to @xmath41 is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the velocity dispersion of clouds of size @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath44 is the cloud size pdf which can be obtained using the simple assumption about cloud mass and density @xmath45 : @xmath46 it is reasonable to describe the fraction of radiated energy for clouds of size @xmath34 by poisson distribution @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the relation of the collision time to cooling time with cooling function @xmath49 : @xmath50 here the cloud density @xmath51 behind a shock wave and the time of collision @xmath52 can be determined for the simple case of head - on collision using the one dimensional approximation , i.e. riemann problem @xcite . in this case",

    "it is set to @xmath64 pc ( this is roughly the scale of open clusters formation , the turbulence scale can not be greater than this ) .",
    "the star formation history in galaxies can have a strongly non - monotonic nature showing a couple of bursts during a galaxy life time .",
    "those bursts can be stimulated by an accretion of gas from intergalactic medium , collisions or close passing of galaxies .",
    "the reason to star formation to stop can be the supernovae explosions @xcite . in star formation history of our galaxy",

    "this epoch may be interpreted as a pause between the end of formation of thick disk and the beginning of formation of thin disk @xcite .",
    "the pause corresponds to star ages between @xmath4 and @xmath5 gyr .",
    "the model of star formation and of dissipation proposed above , was taken to explain this pause in a hierarchical scenario .",
    "these models was built into the single - zone model of evolution of galaxies ( firmani & tutukov @xcite ) which was initially implemented by wiebe @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of modified model and target setting has given in @xcite .",
    "in modified model the star formation suppressed by collision of galaxy and a satellite of mass @xmath68 @xmath69 and radius @xmath70 kpc at redshift @xmath71 .",
    "the results of modelling are presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : mw ] . after collision",
    "the temperature increases almost by two orders causing decrease of dissipation efficiency ( see ( [ eq : dissipation_efficiency ] ) ) with the result that star formation process ceases due to high temperature ( see ( [ eq : sfr ] ) ) for a @xmath72 gyr .",

    "the stars was classified using accurate stellar kinematics @xcite .",

    "the arrow marks the pause of star formation which is close to the bound of populations of thick disk and thin disk .",
    "the consequence of this pause is clear : we can see the discontiniuty of the stars age with continuous abundance history ( see the plateau on fig . [",

    "the standard model of firmani & tutukov @xcite does not give such a plateau , giving the right position and shape of the evolution track , though .",
