    "the discovery of graphene and related two and quasi - two dimensional materials has accelerated interest towards the fabrication of nanometer - scaled two - dimensional materials .",
    "this is because of the high mobility of their electrons and potential use in both mesoscopic research , materials engineering and nanodevices @xcite .",
    "however , the zero band gap of graphene limits its applications in opto - electronic devices .",
    "thereafter several attempts have been made to increase the band gap , e.g. , using bilayer graphene with non - equivalent top and bottom layers @xcite , or by surface doping and electric gating effect @xcite .",
    "another effective technique is the hydrogenation of graphene . a maximum band gap of 0.77 ev has been reached with 54% of hydrogen coverage @xcite .",
    "however a large band gap satisfying commercial requirements of light - emitting diodes ( leds ) or solar cells is still not available .",
    "a graphene sheet with regularly spaced holes ( anti - dots ) can be rendered semi - conducting with a significant and controllable band gap @xcite .",
    "the _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations by son  @xcite reveal band gaps in various graphene nano - ribbons with armchair or zigzag shaped edge .",
    "the fundamental limitations of graphene in micro - electronics have inspired searches for new materials .",
    "a large number of 2d - mono - layers based on various chemical elements or compounds have been proposed . among these",
    "silicene , mos@xmath3 , germanine , etc . have been synthesized successfully and have been found to exhibit new physical properties @xcite .",
    "recently mono - layers and nano - ribbons of boron nitride ( bn ) have been synthesized and honeycomb bn sheet was reported as a wide band - gap ( 4.64 ev ) insulator @xcite .",
    "giovannetti  @xcite have also reported substrate - induced band gap in graphene on hexagonal boron nitride .",
    "hexagonal monolayer of zinc oxide ( zno ) is a ii@xmath4vi metal - oxide analogue of graphene and bn .",
    "works on nanostructures of zno such as mono - layers , nano - belts , nano - tubes , nano - wires and nano - ribbons , were reported and recently the synthesis of zno /bilayer honeycomb structure was also achieved .",
    "these researches have stimulated interests in theoretically understanding fundamental material properties and further promoted exploration of new 2d - nano materials .",
    "2d - honeycomb structure of group iv elements and binary and compounds of iii@xmath4v and ii@xmath4vi group elements has been an active field of research in materials engineering and opto - electronic devices .",
    "2d - layered structures of si and ge have attracted considerable attention .",
    "wurtzite sic structure is graphitic and theoretical investigations indicate that a phase transformation from graphinic to graphite - like structure is possible .",
    "it has been reported that the @xmath5 and @xmath5 * bands of silicon and germanium mono - layers in planar or low buckled structures cross at the k and k@xmath6 points of the brilluoin zone .",
    "first - principles calculations have predicted that si and ge have stable 2d buckled honeycomb structures .",
    "their charge carriers also behave like massless dirac fermions and their @xmath5 and @xmath5 * bands cross linearly at the fermi level . unlike 2d si and ge , the mono - layers sic , gec and snc have stable 2d planar honeycomb structures , which may be attributed to the strong @xmath7-bonding through the perpendicular @xmath8 orbitals @xcite .",
    "the mono - layers xc ( x = si , ge , sn ) have band gaps . two dimensional sic honeycomb sheet is another group iv binary compound displaying interesting properties @xcite .",
    "previously some 2d silicon - carbon binary compounds including hexagonal rings have been proposed , such as hexagonal sic @xcite , tetragonal sic @xcite , g - sic@xmath3 @xcite , pt - sic@xmath3 @xcite , sic@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "these new structures show interesting properties such as a large direct band gap , improved photoluminescence , and high - power conversion efficiency . because the honeycomb /structure is common to both c and si , experimentally stable 2d",
    "sic in honeycomb structure has been synthesized successfully .",
    "recent progress in the fabrication of ultra thin layered 2d si@xmath0c@xmath1 down to a monolayer ( 0.5 - 1.5 nm ) @xcite makes it an emerging semiconductor attractive to both fundamental research and practical applications .",
    "there have been reports of extensive theoretical and computational works on 2d graphinic materials in recent years .",
    "so why another attempt ?",
    "can it shed anything but incremental new light on the topic any further ?",
    "the problem , for us , has three focal areas :    1 .   deciding how to study disorder in the system : both chemical disorder as in alloying and defects , and structural disorder as in amorphous systems .",
    "lack of lattice translational symmetry means that , strictly , the bloch s theorem is no longer valid and quantum states can not be labelled by real ` reciprocal ' vectors @xmath10 . during the latter half of the last century the effect of bloch theorem was so pervasive that it was difficult for most theorists to abandon it altogether .",
    "so the concept of  supercell \" was introduced .",
    "the unit cell was inflated and lattice translational symmetry was introduced on the cell boundaries . within the cell ,",
    "disorder was introduced without affecting the boundary conditions .",
    "there are two drawbacks : first , since translational symmetry is present ( at whatever scale ) , all spectral densities have sharp structure whose disorder - induced smoothening we have to account for ` by hand ' . secondly , although the modeling of local disorder is reasonable , the size of a suitable supercell to model long - ranged disorder as in amorphous materials becomes so large that the actual calculations on quasi - random supercells by standard packages become prohibitive .",
    "+    + rather than have a plethora of different formalisms for different models of disorder , can we not propose a general approach within which we can study both ordered systems and systems in which lattice translational symmetry is broken : as in surfaces and disorered solids ?",
    "the question we ask is , why not start anew and accept heine s tongue - in - cheek advice @xcite to  throw bloch theorem out of the window \" and start from a totally real space approach .",
    "the foundations of such an approach has already been laid by heine and his group @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have adopted their real space recursion method as the main calculational technique .",
    "the many - body study of the valence electronic cloud requires the adoption of the density functional approximation .",
    "it is a well known fact that the standard local density approximation gives a very poor estimate of the band gap in semi - conductors . in this work",
    "we modify the stuttgart linear muffin - tin orbital package by replacing the lda section by a new approach to the exchange part which has given quite accurate band gaps in earlier works @xcite .",
    "we incorporate our new exchange functional and coupled it with the cambridge recursion package of haydock and nex @xcite .",
    "the detailed description of the effect of disorder and configurational averaging was carried out within the augmented space approach proposed earlier by mookerjee and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the augmented space technique allows us to go beyond the local mean field theories like the coherent potential approximation and describe extended disorder like short - ranged clustering or ordering as well as long - ranged disorder like randomly placed stone - wales defect chains forming in a graphene background ( see left panel of fig.[tg ] ) .",
    "formation of such long - ranged random defects have been observed by monte - carlo simulations in our group @xcite and will be reported in detail in a subsequent communication .",
    "moreover , the right panel of fig.[tg ] convinces us that if the atomic sizes of the alloy constituents are very different , chemical disorder can also lead to local random lattice distortion . in an earlier work",
    "@xcite we had shown how the asr can deal with systems with local structural disorder in non - isochoric cube alloys .",
    "the aim of this work is not only a qualitative description of how disorder affects electronic properties , but to be able to predict quantitatively what this effect leads to .",
    "we , then , compare with experimental results and use our predictive conclusions for band - gap engineering .",
    "the detail discussion of computational method and motivation ( mathematical approach ) is been provided in the appendix .",
    "we have considered randomly disordered , binary 2d - siliphene ( si@xmath0c@xmath1 ) , specially because it @xcite has several prominent advantages over graphene .",
    "one of them is a better tunability of the band gap , very important in designing opto - electronic nano - devices .",
    "there has been disagreement between both different theoretical and experimental works on band gap engineering in 2d honeycomb siliphene .",
    "a quick review indicates that the main cause for these disagreements , at least among the theoretical studies , has been the dependence of the results on the underlying models and approximations , e.g. the starting structure , the type of exchange - correlation , the electronic structure method used and how disorder is taken into account , include effects of configuration fluctuations of the immediate neighborhood .",
    "these are just the focus points of our investigation , as described earlier .",
    "experimentally , graphene shows zero band gap at a lattice constant of @xmath11 = 2.47 @xmath12 , while silicene has a 1.90 mev gap with @xmath11 = 3.86 @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the energy difference of 10.66  ev ( e@xmath13e@xmath14 ) for graphene , and 5.66  ev ( e@xmath15e@xmath16 ) for silicene indicate that the valence cloud in graphene we have predominantly @xmath17 hybridization .",
    "thus graphene is more stable as a flat surface , while the valence cloud in silicene has the possibility of @xmath18 hybridization leading to local corrugations and buckling . in our study",
    "we have not included buckling which will be one source of error .     of 2d - si@xmath19c@xmath19 .",
    "the shaded band is for @xmath20 orbital without down - folding while the bands in inset are the down - folded @xmath20 orbitals .",
    "the band gap for the nmto is larger than lmto and in greater agreement with experiment . ]",
    "the experiments of lin  @xcite led to lattice constants of 2d 50 - 50 siliphene ranging from 2.4 @xmath12 to 2.8 @xmath12 using high resolution transmission electron microscope .",
    "gixrd analysis confirmed @xmath11 = 2.66 @xmath12 .",
    "the two earlier theoretical approaches were by bekaroglu  @xcite and the azadeh  @xcite .",
    "both used @xmath10-space dft approaches available in the vasp , siesta and wein2k codes @xcite .",
    "this restricted their study to ordered stoichiometric compositions in strict accordance with bloch s theorem , ignoring the effects of disorder . for 2d si@xmath2c@xmath1 ( x=0.5 ) , bekaroglu  used generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) within projector augmented wave approach @xcite and proposed theoretical lattice constant @xmath21 3.094 @xmath12 nearly equal to that for wurtzite sic ( @xmath11 = 3.08 @xmath12 ) .",
    "azadeh  introduce an interesting in - crystal - site doping or combination stoichiometric method to generate some ` semi - random ' compositions and studied them using the wien2k code @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have performed first - principles calculations on si@xmath2c@xmath1 ( 0 @xmath22 0.6 ) and compared our predictions with some existing experimental and theoretical results .",
    "the vlb - corrected lda @xcite provides an accurate band structure and density of states for 2d - si@xmath19c@xmath19 , in fig.[fig2 ] ( b ) , ( d ) , calculated at lattice constant 2.66 @xmath12 .",
    "the vlb+lda provides indirect band gap of 2.96 ev along k@xmath23 symmetry direction of the brilluoin zone .",
    "the left panel shows nmto calculated ( a ) band - structure , and ( c ) density of states .",
    "the maximum dos contribution comes from the @xmath24 orbital with indirect ( direct ) bg of 3.59 ( 3.90 ) ev along k@xmath4 m ( k@xmath4k ) symmetry direction . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the band structure and density of states of 2d - si@xmath1c@xmath2 .",
    "graphene ( 2d - si@xmath0c@xmath1 , x=0 ) is a zero - band gap semiconductor and exhibits semi - metallic behavior , while silicene ( si@xmath0c@xmath1 , x=1 ) , theoretical equivalent of graphene with silicon doping , is also supposed to be gap less .",
    "the honeycomb lattice of randomly distributed silicon atoms in symmetric semi - metallic graphene opens a gapped periodic structure , which has semi - conducting behavior .",
    "therefore , silicon doping level allows us to tune the band structure of the si@xmath0c@xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , we plot the bg and tdos ( total density of states ) to see the effect of chemical disorder on 2d - si@xmath0c@xmath1 at different % si . we use graphene lattice constant , @xmath11 = 2.46 @xmath12 and a = 3.094 @xmath12 to check the bg variation in disordered 2d - si@xmath0c@xmath1 . the trend in our calculations is consistent with previous results of azadeh  in ordered cases of 2d - si@xmath0c@xmath1 , see table .",
    "the theoretically predicted lattice constant , a = 3.094 @xmath12 , give almost constant variation in bg with increasing % si . at graphene",
    "@xmath11 = 2.46 @xmath12 , the bg increases with increasing disorder strength ( x ) and reaches maximum at 50%si , and further increasing % si reduces the bg .",
    "the large atomic size of si enhances the interaction strength , and also hybridization between the p@xmath25 orbital for both si and c. while the @xmath26-band remains unchanged contrary to @xmath5-band .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "although the lda and pbe functionals can capture most of the characteristic features of the optical permittivity , it is not sufficiently accurate in the visible light region , which is important for nanoplasmonic applications .",
    "the approach we introduce reduces the degree of underestimation of the transition energy , the predicted optical properties are closer to experimental data .",
    "also , the effects of vlb+lda exchange correlation functional on optical electromagnetic simulations may offer a more reliable strategy to design and to investigate some additional functional devices and to conduct more application studies .    in summary , we perform dft calculations with a lda+vlb exchange - correlation function to calculate the 2d optical conductivity , real and imaginary parts , of an isolated single - atom - thick layer consisting of a group - iv honeycomb crystal .",
    "we focused our studies on disordered 2d si@xmath27c@xmath1 , and show good agreement between theoretical calculations with experimental observations .",
    "we also found that silicon can be used to tune the band - gap in si@xmath2c@xmath1 , which enhances the optical conductivity .",
    "based on the electronic structure and optical response of disordered 2d si@xmath1c@xmath0 , we believe this alloy can be a potential candidate for solar cell material .",
