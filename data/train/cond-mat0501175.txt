    "eq.([eq-17 ] ) gives the general edmft instability criterion without further approximation and applies to the @xmath10 line where the afm solution at @xmath61 disappears .",
    "the existence of the electron - hole bubble at the ordering wave vector in eq.([eq-18 ] ) reveals the fact that even in the infinite coordination limit where the mean field method becomes exact , there is still a non - vanishing momentum - dependent contribution in the effective spin susceptibility .",
    "the matrix inversions in eq.([eq-18 ] ) involve matrices labeled by four time coordinates , two for the row and two for the column , respectively . as a result , this expression is generally very complicated and can not be further simplified .",
    "+      in the edmft of the pm phase , the effective susceptibility given in eq.([eq-18 ] ) contributes directly to the spin self - energy @xcite and , as a result , should be local in space .",
    "this means we need further to restrict @xmath62 to be local .",

    "comparing with the boson dyson equation ( [ eq-10 ] ) , we see that the above instability criterion is identical to the stoner criterion in which the divergence of the magnetic susceptibility at @xmath61 signals phase transition @xcite . +",
    "we have derived in this paper the phase instability criterion of the edmft solution to the periodic anderson model for both the afm and pm phases . the generic instability criterion ( which applies to @xmath10 line in fig.[fig-01 ] )",
    "involves an effective spin susceptibility , eq.([eq-17 ] ) , and is different from that used to determine the transition line ( @xmath11 ) bounding the pm phase , eq.([eq-19 ] ) .",
    "the difference is in an extra electron - hole bubble at the afm ordering wave - vector in the former .",
    "this bubble is momentum dependent and survives in the infinite coordination limit . as a result , at the locus where one of the phases reaches the instability condition ,",
    "the other one remains stable .",
    "this explains the phase coexistence .",
    "it persists to @xmath0 since the electron - hole bubble remains non - zero .",
    "this is consistent with what we obtained numerically @xcite in region ii of fig.[fig-01](c ) . we should point out , though , at dimensions @xmath68 and temperatures @xmath69 [ region i in fig.[fig-01](c ) ] , the difference between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 lines becomes negligibly small @xcite .",
    "this is due to the spatial correlation becoming weaker at higher dimensions @xcite and temperatures .",
    "we note in passing that no matter which criterion is satisfied , the divergence of the corresponding effective spin susceptibility at the afm ordering wave vector naturally results in the divergence of the local spin susceptibility as long as the spin fluctuations are two dimensional @xcite .",
    "this is a result of the dimensionality and has nothing to do with the spin self - energy being local in space . +",
    "the true mean field transition is thus first order and lies between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 lines where the free energies of the two phases cross .",
    "physically , the two sublattice edmft ( as applied in the afm phase ) contains in its instability criterion an electron - hole bubble , which serves as a rough description of the feedback from the electron - hole excitations to the spin response .",
    "however , this feedback does not appear explicitly in the edmft self - consistency , which is evident from what we described in appendix [ sec - a1 ] . as a result , the edmft spin susceptibility , which is different from the physical one in the instability criterion , eq.([eq-17 ] ) ,",
    "does not experience any singularity as the @xmath10 line is crossed . on the other hand , the homogeneous edmft ( as applied in the pm phase ) ,",
    "contains the same singular behavior in the spin response as that in the instability criterion , eq.([eq-19 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "when the phase boundary is approached , edmft is able to adjust self - consistently to reflect the singular behavior in the spin channel .",
    "however , as we have already noted , the problem on this side is that the feedback from the non - local electron - hole excitations is totally missing .",
    "so both the transition lines contain unphysical features , and neither of them , as far as the critical properties are concerned , is close to the true transition .",
    "a related issue , which concerns the critical exponent @xmath70 in eq.([eq-01 ] ) along the @xmath11 line , further supports our conclusion .",
    "it was shown that at @xmath0 on the @xmath11 line , the critical frequency dependence could not develop a sublinear form @xcite .",
    "+ after all , it is not a surprise that , although it works well qualitatively in describing many other physical properties @xcite , the edmft fails to capture the right phase transition .",
    "this is certainly one of the issues one needs to improve over the mean field approach .",
    "given what we have concluded in this paper , it seems important that one needs to find a way allowing proper feedback from the electron - hole excitations , which is spatially non - local , to the f - electron spin response .",
    "a natural way to proceed is to combine the edmft scheme with the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite . in this combination",
    ", the spin self - energy contains the local edmft part together with the non - local rpa part .",
    "this is a desirable feature as one can see from the edmft instability criterion eq.([eq-18 ] ) . besides , the scheme is derivable from the baym - kadanoff functional @xcite",
    "of course , with the new scheme , the instability criterion itself is modified and its implication to the heavy fermion phase transition has not yet been explored . a different route is to utilize the cellular dmft @xcite .",
    "to this end , a two impurity anderson model subject to the dmft self - consistent electron bath results in a qualitative improvement @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", the rkky interaction is generated dynamically , instead of being added in by hand as in eq.([eq-02 ] ) .",
    "the spin susceptibility across the two impurity sites , which contains the corresponding electron - hole bubble as the lead order contribution , renders a limited momentum dependence and turns out to be essential to the improvement .",
