    "we study a stochastic ( semi ) game of the following form . given an initial condition @xmath0 in time and space , we try to find a strategy @xmath1 $ ] such that the controlled state process @xmath2,\\nu}(\\cdot)$ ] reaches a certain target at the given time @xmath3 , no matter which control @xmath4 is chosen by the adverse player .",
    "the target is specified in terms of expected loss ; that is , we are given a real - valued ( `` loss '' ) function @xmath5 and try to keep the expected loss above a given threshold @xmath6 , @xmath7,\\nu } _ { t , z}(t ) \\bigr)|\\mathcal{f } _ { t } \\bigr]\\geq p\\qquad\\mbox{a.s.}\\ ] ] instead of a game , one may also see this as a target problem under knightian uncertainty ; then the adverse player has the role of choosing a worst - case scenario .",
    "our aim is to describe , for given @xmath8 , the set @xmath9 of all pairs @xmath10 such that there exists a strategy @xmath11 attaining the target .",
    "we provide , in a general abstract framework , a geometric dynamic programming principle  ( gdp ) for this set . to this end , @xmath12 is seen as an additional state variable and formulated dynamically via a family @xmath13 of auxiliary martingales with expectation @xmath12 , indexed by the adverse controls @xmath4 .",
    "heuristically , the gdp then takes the following form : @xmath9 consists of all @xmath10 such that there exist a strategy @xmath11 and a family @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14,\\nu}_{t , z } ( \\tau ) , m^{\\nu } ( \\tau ) \\bigr ) \\in{\\lambda } ( \\tau ) \\qquad\\mbox{a.s.}\\ ] ] for all adverse controls @xmath4 and all stopping times @xmath15 .",
    "the precise version of the gdp , stated in theorem  [ thmgdp ] , incorporates several relaxations that allow us to deal with various technical problems .",
    "in particular , the selection of @xmath16-optimal strategies is solved by a covering argument which is possible due to a continuity assumption on @xmath5 and a relaxation in the variable @xmath12 .",
    "the martingale @xmath17 is constructed from the semimartingale decomposition of the adverse player s value process .",
    "our gdp is tailored such that the dynamic programming equation can be derived in the viscosity sense .",
    "we exemplify this in theorem  [ thmpdederivavecz ] for the standard setup where the state process is determined by a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) with coefficients controlled by the two players ; however , the general gdp applies also in other situations such as singular control .",
    "the solution of the equation , a partial differential equation ( pde ) in our example , corresponds to the function of ( the complement of ) the graph of @xmath18 . in theorem",
    "[ thmpdederivavecx , y ] , we specialize to a case with a monotonicity condition , that is , particularly suitable for pricing problems in mathematical finance .",
    "finally , in order to illustrate various points made throughout the paper , we consider a concrete example of pricing an option with partial hedging , according to a loss constraint , in a model where the drift and volatility coefficients of the underlying are uncertain . in a worst - case analysis , the uncertainty corresponds to an adverse player choosing the coefficients ; a formula for the corresponding seller s price is given in theorem  [ thmexplicitexpression ] .",
    "stochastic target ( control ) problems with almost - sure constraints , corresponding to the case where @xmath5 is an indicator function and @xmath19 is absent , were introduced in @xcite as an extension of the classical superhedging problem  @xcite in mathematical finance .",
    "stochastic target problems with controlled loss were first studied in @xcite and are inspired by the quantile hedging problem  @xcite .",
    "the present paper is the first to consider stochastic target games .",
    "the rigorous treatment of zero - sum stochastic differential games was pioneered in @xcite , where the mentioned selection problem for @xmath16-optimal strategies was treated by a discretization and a passage to continuous - time limit in the pdes .",
    "let us remark , however , that we have not been able to achieve satisfactory results for our problem using such techniques .",
    "we have been importantly influenced by @xcite , where the value functions are defined in terms of essential infima and suprema , and then shown to be deterministic .",
    "the formulation with an essential infimum ( rather than an infimum of suitable expectations ) in  ( [ eqtargetintro ] ) is crucial in our case , mainly because @xmath13 is constructed by a method of non - markovian control , which raises the fairly delicate problem of dealing with one nullset for every adverse control @xmath4 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sectgdp ] contains the abstract setup and gdp . in section  [ secexample ]",
    "we specialize to the case of a controlled sde and derive the corresponding pde , first in the general case and then in the monotone case .",
    "the problem of hedging under uncertainty is discussed in section  [ sectpartialhedging ] .",
    "in this section , we obtain our geometric dynamic programming principle ( gdp ) in an abstract framework .",
    "some of our assumptions are simply the conditions we need in the proof of the theorem ; we will illustrate later how to actually verify them in a typical setup .",
    "we fix a time horizon @xmath20 and a probability space @xmath21 equipped with a filtration @xmath22}$ ] satisfying the usual conditions of right - continuity and completeness .",
    "we shall consider two sets @xmath23 and @xmath24 of controls ; for the sake of concreteness , we assume that each of these sets consists of stochastic processes on @xmath25 , indexed by @xmath26 $ ] and with values in some sets @xmath27  and  @xmath28 , respectively .",

    "each @xmath31 is called a strategy , and the notation @xmath32 $ ] will be used for the control it associates with @xmath33 . in applications , @xmath29 will be chosen to consist of mappings that are nonanticipating ; see section  [ secexample ] for an example .",

    "the main aim of this paper is to provide a geometric dynamic programming principle for @xmath9 . for the case without adverse player ,",
    "a corresponding result was obtained in  @xcite for the target problem with almost - sure constraints and in  @xcite for the problem with controlled loss .    as mentioned above",
    ", the dynamic programming for problem  ( [ eqdefinitiondureachabilityset ] ) requires the introduction of a suitable set of martingales starting from @xmath6 .",
    "this role will be played by certain families , like @xmath47 , and mappings on @xmath24 , like @xmath11 .",
    "we shall use both notions interchangeably , depending on notational convenience . ]",
    "@xmath47 of martingales which should be considered as additional controls .",
    "more precisely , we denote by @xmath48 the set of all real - valued ( right - continuous ) martingales @xmath49 satisfying @xmath50 @xmath51-a.s . , and we fix a set @xmath52 of families @xmath53 ; further assumptions on @xmath52 will be introduced below .",
    "since these martingales are not present in the original problem  ( [ eqdefinitiondureachabilityset ] ) , we can choose @xmath52 at our convenience ; see also remark  [ remmartisnonanticip ] below .    as usual in optimal control , we shall need to concatenate controls and strategies in time according to certain events .",
    "we use the notation @xmath54}+\\bar { \\nu}\\mathbf { 1}_{(\\tau , t]}\\ ] ] for the concatenation of two controls @xmath55 at a stopping time @xmath56 .",

    "in contrast to the setting of control , strategies can be concatenated only at particular events and stopping times , as otherwise the resulting strategies would fail to be elements of @xmath29 ( in particular , because they may fail to be nonanticipating , see also section  [ secexample ] ) .",
    "therefore , we need to formalize the events and stopping times which are admissible for this purpose : for each @xmath58 , we consider a set @xmath59 whose elements are families @xmath60 of events indexed by @xmath24 , as well as a set @xmath61 whose elements are families @xmath62 , where @xmath63 denotes the set of all stopping times with values in @xmath64 $ ] .",
