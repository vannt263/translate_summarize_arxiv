    "from lattice simulations it is known that the theory of strong interactions , qcd , undergoes a phase transition at a temperature @xmath0 160 mev @xcite from a confined hadronic phase to a phase where quarks and gluons constitute the relevant degrees of freedom , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "it is hoped that it is possible to create this qgp in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions at cern and rhic .",
    "dileptons ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairs ) are interesting probes in this context since they do not interact strongly but rather escape unthermalized from the hot and dense region formed in such collisions , the fireball . in the early stage ,",
    "a thermalized qgp phase is expected to exist .",
    "there , dileptons originate mainly from @xmath3 annihilation processes .",
    "as the fireball expands , it cools off and hadronization sets in at @xmath4 . in the hadronic phase ,",
    "the main dilepton sources are pion and kaon annihilation processes which are enhanced due to the formation of the light vector mesons @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "+ the differential dilepton emission rate from a hot domain in thermal equilibrium is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the spin - averaged time - like self energy of a photon in the heat bath , @xmath9 is the photon four - momentum , @xmath10 , and the lepton masses have been neglected .",
    "this rate has to be integrated over the time evolution of the fireball volume @xmath11 and temperature @xmath12 .",
    "thermal perturbation theory is presumably not applicable to evaluate im@xmath8 in the qgp .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath13 is large , and the maximal temperatures reached in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions are still @xmath14 , indicating that non - perturbative physics is important .",
    "consequently , we try to use a more phenomenological approach to thermal qcd .",
    "it has been shown that it is possible to describe the equation of state ( eos ) of qcd as obtained from lattice calculations by the eos of a free gas of quasiparticles with thermally generated masses @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the model employs effective , non - interacting massive quarks and gluons as the relevant degrees of freedom , all dynamics is incorporated in a @xmath16-dependent effective coupling constant @xmath17 .",
    "this coupling is based on the expression for the running coupling at @xmath18 . for the quark masses",
    "@xmath19 the two parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 are fitted to the lattice data : @xmath22 ^ 2}.\\label{m_q}\\ ] ] hence , the only qgp contribution to im@xmath8 in eq.([e - rate ] ) is the @xmath3-loop , evaluated with the thermal quark masses ( [ m_q ] ) .",
    "below @xmath4 , confinement sets in and the effective degrees of freedom change .",
    "the photon couples now to hadronic @xmath23 states : the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath6 mesons and multi - pion states carrying the same quantum numbers .",
    "the electromagnetic current - current correlation function can be connected to the currents generated by these mesons using an effective lagrangian which approximates the @xmath26 flavour sector of qcd at low energies .",
    "the appropriate model for our purposes is the _ improved vector meson dominance _ model combined with chiral dynamics of pions and kaons as described in @xcite . within this model , the following relation between the imaginary part of the irreducible photon self - energy @xmath27 and the vector meson self - energies @xmath28 in vacuum",
    "is derived : @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the ( renormalized ) vector meson masses , @xmath31 is the @xmath32 coupling and @xmath33 the @xmath34 coupling , where @xmath35 stands for one of the pseudoscalar goldstone bosons @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "eq.([imbarpi ] ) is valid for a virtual photon with vanishing three - momentum .",
    "finite temperature modifications of the vector meson self - energies are calculated using thermal feynman rules , the explicit calculations for the @xmath24- , @xmath25- and @xmath6-meson can be found in @xcite . at sps energies , there is still considerable stopping of the interpenetrating nuclei , resulting in a net baryon density in the central rapidity region . for the evaluations of these finite baryon",
    "density effects , we use the results discussed in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that in the linear density approximation @xmath38 is related to the vector meson - nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath39 @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the nucleon states with vanishing momentum . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the temperature- and density dependences of @xmath38 factorize , _",
    "i.e. _ we replace in eq.([piv ] ) @xmath42 by the temperature - dependent @xmath43 and leave @xmath39 unaffected .",
    "this amounts to neglecting contributions from matrix elements like @xmath44 ( meson - nucleon - pion scatterings where the pion comes from the heat bath ) .",
    "furthermore , this approximation does not take into consideration a possible @xmath16-dependent pion or nucleon mass .",
    "the corresponding spectra at finite temperature and density are depicted in figure [ spectra ] .",
    "eq.([e - rate ] ) is now integrated over the space - time evolution of the fireball and the detector acceptance of the ceres / na45 experiment at cern , using the expressions for im@xmath8 from the previous sections .",
    "we use simple parametrizations , adapted to the ceres conditions , for the volume @xmath11 and the temperature @xmath12 @xcite based on more involved calculations utilizing microscopic transport equations . the corresponding rate and",
    "the data @xcite are shown in figure [ ceres1 ] .",
    "we have considered two cases for the qgp phase : a scenario with massive quarks according to eq.([m_q ] ) and an ideal gas scenario with massless quarks .",
    "+ the low invariant mass region 0.3 - 0.6 gev is mainly filled by the strong broadening of the @xmath24-meson at finite density , contributions from the early qgp phase are subdominant . in the quasiparticle approach , the quark masses appear to become heavy close to @xmath4 ( @xmath45 gev ) , thus there is no radiation from the qgp below the @xmath46 threshold in the invariant mass .",
    "+ the @xmath25 meson almost loses its quasiparticle structure at high temperatures @xmath47 mev because of the scattering @xmath48 off thermally excited pions .",
    "its peak structure is not visible in the dilepton yield and this may act as a signal for medium effects when the corresponding experimental resolution is increased . on the contrast , the @xmath6 meson remains a distinct peak over the flat qgp spectrum and can be used as both a thermometer and a chronometer for the fireball expansion . in the high invariant mass region ,",
    "the contribution from the hadronic phase dies away , and the slope of the dilepton yield is mainly dominated by the averaged temperature @xmath49 and is insensitive to the existence of thermal masses .",
    "we also checked that a possible mixed phase would not leave any distinct traces in the dilepton spectrum .",
    "+ to uniquely identify signals for the formation of a qgp , it remains a crucial task to further investigate temperature and density effects on the hadronic spectra ."
