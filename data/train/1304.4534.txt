    "the tuple @xmath13 is usually refered to as the lvy triplet . for a further introduction see e.g. the textbooks @xcite .    for @xmath14",
    "we denote by @xmath15 the law of @xmath0 when it is started at @xmath16 and we abbreviate @xmath17 .",
    "accordingly we shall write @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the associated expectation operators .",

    "such problems have been studied thoroughly and have applications in many fields , where option pricing theory in modern mathematical finance is maybe one of the most appealing ones .",
    "see e.g. the textbook @xcite for a recent overview of the general theory concerning optimal stopping problems , and e.g. @xcite for an introduction to mathematical finance and explanation of the related terms used here .",
    "for example , if in a typical black & scholes setup the price of the risky asset @xmath26 is assumed to evolve as @xmath27 for all @xmath5 while the price of the riskless asset @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 for all @xmath5 then @xmath30 can be interpreted is a martingale . if @xmath0 is not a brownian motion there are typically multiple measures @xmath31 equivalent to each other under which @xmath32 is a martingale . for this paper",

    "@xmath38 . such lvy process",
    "driven market models have received considerable attention in recent years , in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations of the classic black & scholes model where @xmath0 is a brownian motion .",
    "see e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is well known that in general no closed form formula exists for ( [ def_stop_orig ] ) .",
    "results do exist for certain combinations of payoff functions @xmath24 and lvy processes @xmath0 when @xmath39 , but when @xmath40  as we assume throughout this paper  one typically has to settle for approximating @xmath30 rather .    in his celebrated paper @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , carr proposes a method for this he refers to as ` canadisation ' .",
    "the idea is to introduce a ` stochastic time grid ' , which is a grid where the distances between consecutive grid points forms a sequence of independent random variables with an identical exponential distribution .",
    "the grid gets finer as the common mean of the exponential distributions vanishes .",
    "the value of an american option with expiry date @xmath34 is then approximated by the value of the same american option but with the expiry date replaced by a grid point close to @xmath34 . this approximating value function can be determined by performing a backwards induction over the grid points .",
    "carr works out this algorithm for the american put option driven by a brownian motion .",
    "see also @xcite and the references therein for more general applications of carr s algorithm .    as shown in @xcite carr s canadisation",
    "is also viable for brownian motion with exponential jumps .",
    "however , it does not seem easy to apply this algorithm to more general lvy processes due to the fact that the backwards induction over the grid points is involved and ( hence ) imposes restrictions .",
    "this paper introduces a variation of the canadisation algorithm , where some changes to the original setup are made so that the backwards induction over the grid points becomes more straightforward .",
    "indeed , the resulting adjusted algorithm allows to approximate @xmath30 by elementary functions not just for brownian motion plus exponential jumps but for any so - called _ meromorphic _ lvy process .",
    "the class of meromorphic lvy processes was recently introduced in @xcite and can be defined as the family of all lvy processes whose lvy measure has a density that consists of an infinite mixture of exponentials , see section [ sec_example ] for further details and examples of such processes .",
    "this is a rich class , where in particular also infinite activity jumps are possible .",
    "it contains for instance the family of so - called @xmath41-processes ( cf .",
    "furthermore many lvy processes that play a prominent role in mathematical finance can in a straightforward way be obtained by considering limiting cases of meromorphic lvy processes , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "examples include generalized tempered stable processes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , kobol processes ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , tempered stable processes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and cgmy processes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in particular meromorphic lvy processes have the property that the law of the process evaluated at an independent , exponentially distributed time is an infinite mixture of exponentials ( cf .",
    "proposition [ prop_mproc ] ) .",
    "( in fact meromorphic lvy processes are the only lvy processes for which this is the case . )",
    "note that for a brownian motion with hyperexponential jumps this law is a finite mixture of exponentials .",
    "this property is key in our algorithm , as becomes clear in section [ sec_example ] . indeed ,",
    "if this is the case every step in the algorithm can be worked out explicitly in terms of elementary functions provided the payoff function @xmath24 in ( [ def_stop_orig ] ) can ( piecewise ) be expressed as a linear combination of functions of the form @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this is for instance the case for the classic example of the american put option , where @xmath36 for some @xmath37 . for any payoff function not of this type",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to approximate it by a function of this type and estimate the error due to this approximation , cf .",
    "remark [ rem1 ] .",
    "pricing american options driven by lvy processes has received considerable attention in recent years . indeed",
    "several other possible techniques were developed , including ( but not limited to ) tree - based methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) and variational methods ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "see also the overview in @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison of all available methods with the one proposed in this paper would constitute a paper in itself and we do not embark on such a task here .",
    "the authors feel the main appeal of the method presented in this paper lies in the fact that it is a ` light weight ' method which is probabilistic in nature and does not need any involved proofs or tools from other fields .",
    "furthermore the computer implementation is rather straightforward as only elementary operations are required ( together with the straightforward operation of numerical root finding ) .",
    "finally the method is flexible and can easily be adjusted to deal with situations where for instance the option has a bermudan type structure , i.e. where exercising is only allowed in certain subsets of @xmath45 $ ] , or there is some path dependency in the payoff ( for instance when the payoff also depends on the path supremum ) .",

    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec_alg ]",
    "we introduce the algorithm in detail and spend some time discussing the difference with the original canadisation approach . in section [ sec_main ]",
    "we make the algorithm rigorous . in section [ sec_example ]",
    "we work out the algorithm in detail for the prominent example of the american put , where the driving process is a meromorphic lvy process ( or a brownian motion plus ( hyper)exponential jumps ) . in that section",

    "for any expiry date @xmath55 , choosing a sequence @xmath56 such that @xmath57 as @xmath58 we have for any @xmath14 that @xmath68 as @xmath58 ( cf .",
    "theorem [ thm_main ] ( ii ) ) .",
    "furthermore , for any @xmath46 the sequence of functions @xmath69 satisfies the following recursion :    @xmath70 \\right\\ } \\mbox { for $ k \\geq 1$,}\\ ] ]    where @xmath71 is an exponentially distributed random variable with mean @xmath72 , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this is easily seen by a dynamic programming argument .",
    "indeed , consider ( [ def_stop_new ] ) for some @xmath14 .",
    "the available stopping times allow to stop either immediately or at @xmath73 or later .",
    "stopping immediately yields a payoff of @xmath74 while the ( current ) value of waiting until @xmath73 or later equals the discounted expected value of the option with expiry date @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "hence @xmath77 equals the maximum of the two .",
    "the main point of this setup is that the recursion ( [ eq_recursion ] ) is very straightforward . indeed ,",
    "as already alluded to in the introduction , for any meromorphic lvy process the law of @xmath78 is a mixture of exponentials . as a consequence ( [ eq_recursion ] )",
    "can be worked out explicitly for example if @xmath36 , where first the expectation is computed explicitly and next the maximum is easily determined , cf .",
    "section [ sec_example ] .",

    "e.g. @xcite ) dictates that the optimal stopping time in ( [ carr1 ] ) is the first time that @xmath0 enters a subset @xmath81 of the state space @xmath82 , say @xmath83 .",
    "hence , in order to find an explicit expression for ( [ carr1 ] ) one requirement is to know the mean of @xmath84 .",
    "carr worked with brownian motion in which case this quantity is available in closed form .",
    "however once @xmath0 has jumps this becomes much more involved .",
    "for meromorphic lvy processes expressions are available that could in principle be used when @xmath81 is a halfline or an interval ( cf .",
    "theorem 3 and theorem 5 in @xcite ) but these are quite involved and complicated to implement . if @xmath81 consists of a union of intervals the situation becomes even much more complicated .",
    "namely , for the overshoot the possibility that @xmath0 jumps between different disconnected parts of @xmath85 ( the complement of @xmath81 ) would have to be taken into account .",
    "that is , for some @xmath86 the rhs of ( [ carr1 ] ) would depend on the values the function @xmath87 takes in intervals that are part of @xmath85 and that @xmath0 could reach by a jump without entering @xmath81 first .",
    "furthermore , in the case of an american put , i.e. @xmath36 , it can be shown that @xmath88 $ ] for some @xmath89 ( depending on @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) and it remains to determine @xmath89 .",
    "for other payoff functions it may a priori very well not be clear at all what shape @xmath81 exactly takes , which makes the above task even more challenging .",
    "on the other hand , the recursion ( [ eq_recursion ] ) generated by our algorithm is much more straightforward to implement . in the case of the american",

    "it has a characteristic exponent given by    @xmath193    where @xmath194 is the beta function and the parameter ranges are @xmath8 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the corresponding lvy measure has density    @xmath197 note that setting @xmath198 and @xmath199 yields a process with paths of bounded variation , all other choices paths of unbounded variation .",
    "furthermore infinite ( resp .",

    "a second example is the _",

    "@xmath210 ) the characteristic exponent is given in terms of trigonometric ( resp .",
    "digamma ) functions .    as a final example we mention _",
    "general hypergeometric lvy processes _ , these were introduced in @xcite as an example of how to use vigon s theory of philantropy ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for constructing new lvy processes .",
    "they have a characteristic exponent given by    @xmath211 where @xmath212 and @xmath213 is the laplace exponent of a ( possibly killed ) subordinator from the above mentioned @xmath41-class , which hence takes the form    @xmath214 for a killing rate @xmath215 .",
    "these examples illustrate how rich the class of meromorphic lvy processes is .",
    "let us now return to working out our algorithm in the case of the american put .",
    "we start by noting that for the payoff function ( [ def_payoff_put ] ) it is straightforward to derive the following simplification of the recursion for the functions @xmath216 stated in theorem [ thm_main ] ( i ) .",
    "[ prop_alg_put ] suppose that @xmath217 , i.e. @xmath0 is not a subordinator .",

    "then @xmath231 and @xmath232 as @xmath0 not being a subordinator implies that @xmath233 .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath234 is convex for any @xmath235 the first term in the formula of @xmath236 is also convex and thus @xmath236 has a unique zero on @xmath237 $ ] . combining these observations with theorem [ thm_main ] ( i )",
    "yields ( i ) and ( ii ) above .",
    "this also shows that @xmath238 on @xmath239 , while for @xmath240 we have @xmath241 as @xmath0 not being a subordinator implies @xmath242 , so ( iii ) is also established .",
    "now suppose that ( i)-(iii ) above hold for @xmath243 ( ih ( i ) , ih ( ii ) and ih ( iii ) ) .",
    "analogue to above , denote for @xmath228 the left hand side of the equation in ( i ) after the substitution @xmath230 :    @xmath244 - f(\\log s).\\ ] ] by ih ( ii ) we again have @xmath245 .",

    "consequently @xmath248 has a unique zero on @xmath237 $ ] , located in @xmath221 , and in combination with theorem [ thm_main ] ( i ) , statement ( i ) and ( ii ) follow .",
    "it remains to show ( iii ) .",
    "it follows from the above and ih ( ii ) that @xmath250 on @xmath251 $ ] . for @xmath252",
    "we have by ( ii ) , ih ( ii ) , ih ( iii ) and @xmath0 not being a subordinator that    @xmath253 > e^{-r / n } \\mathbb{e}_{x } \\left [   v_{k-2}^{(n)}(x_{\\xi^{(n ) } } ) \\right ] = v^{(n)}_{k-1}(x)\\ ] ] and we are done .",
    "note that the above result shows that in the approximating value functions it is optimal to stop as soon as @xmath0 falls below a certain level . or , equivalently ,",
    "as soon as the stock price @xmath254 falls below a certain level .",
    "this is structurally consistent with the exact optimal exercise strategy in the original problem , which is to stop as soon as @xmath26 falls below a certain time dependent boundary ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath0 satisfies ( [ dens_x ] ) , i.e. in particular if @xmath0 is a meromorphic lvy process , then it turns out the expectations in the above proposition [ prop_alg_put ] can be worked out explicitly .",
    "the proof uses induction over @xmath49 and consists of tedious yet straightforward computations , it is therefore omitted .",
    "[ prop_put_form ] suppose that @xmath0 satisfies ( [ dens_x ] ) and is not compound poisson .",
    "fix some @xmath100 . for any @xmath101",
    "the function @xmath102 can be expressed in piecewise form as follows :    @xmath255    where @xmath256 .",
    "expressions for @xmath220 and all the coefficients involved can be found in appendix [ sec_app_form ] .",
    "[ rem1 ]    * note that in the brownian motion case , the structure of the formulae for the @xmath102 s from proposition [ prop_put_form ] matches the corresponding formulae found by carr with his canadisation method ( cf .",
    "section [ sec_alg ] ) .",
    "that is , the formulae coincide except for the values of the coefficients @xmath257 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 , and for the values of the boundary points @xmath260 . *",
    "any payoff function @xmath24 that can ( piecewise ) be expressed as a linear combination of functions of the form @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be dealt with in similar fashion and yields a similar structure as ( [ formula_vk ] ) . if a result as in proposition [ prop_alg_put ] is not available , i.e. if it is a priori not clear how the maximum in the recursive relation ( [ main_rec ] ) works out , a way forward is to implement a dynamic decision rule where first a formula for + @xmath261\\ ] ] is computed ( which is still of the same structure as in ( [ formula_vk ] ) ) and then @xmath262 can be determined in a straightforward way .",
    "+ finally , a payoff function that is not of this convenient form mentioned above can easily be approximated by a function which is of this convenient form , and it is straightforward to estimate the error due to this approximation . * it would be possible to further extend this approach to deal with more complicated payoffs involving path dependency , for instance to cases where the payoff at time @xmath263 depends also on the running supremum @xmath264 as is the case for ` lookback options ' . a step in the algorithm",
    "would then not only require @xmath265 but the pair @xmath266 rather .",
    "explicit expressions for the law of this pair is available for meromorphic lvy processes .",
    "in this section we discuss some numerics for the american put , obtained by a computer implementation of the result in proposition [ prop_put_form ] .",
    "in particular we present some graphs of approximating value functions @xmath102 and some graphs of the approximative optimal exercise boundary . for the latter , as is well known ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) the optimal stopping time @xmath267 in ( [ def_stop_orig ] ) with @xmath36 is of the form    @xmath268    for some non - increasing function @xmath269 on @xmath189 referred to as the optimal exercise boundary , which may hence be defined as    @xmath270 hence , since for large @xmath48 we have @xmath271 for all @xmath105 and recalling the result of proposition [ prop_alg_put ] it should be expected ` pastes smoothly ' onto @xmath24 , i.e. their first derivatives in the space component coincide .",
    "consequently it is not a straightforward application of the implicit function theorem ] that the set of points @xmath272 , in the captions of the plots referred to as ` boundary points ' , form an approximation of the set @xmath273 .",
    "next , we briefly describe the two main tasks for creating the graphs of different value functions and boundary points presented further below .",
    "the first step is the calculation of the solutions @xmath274 and @xmath275 of @xmath182 and of the coefficients @xmath276 and @xmath277 by using proposition [ prop_mproc ] for @xmath278 and @xmath279 . in case",
    "a meromorphic lvy process is used for which @xmath280 or @xmath281 the infinite sums need to be truncated . for this we used the ad - hoc approach of ensuring that the truncated sums represent at least @xmath282 of the mass of @xmath78 , i.e. ( compare with ( [ dens_x ] ) ) we determined @xmath283 such that    @xmath284 and then normalised the coefficients .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath139 is larger in the case of meromorphic lvy process with finite variation than in the cases with infinite variation . particularly , if @xmath285 the largest part of the probability mass is concentrated on @xmath286 and @xmath287 whereas the other zeroes contribute only a small part .",
    "the second main step is the recursive computation of the value function and the boundary points using formula ( [ formula_vk ] ) .",
    "a program for this purpose was written in the language c++ .",
    "we found that in certain cases the algorithm may need more than the default ` double precision ' as working precision in order to have enough significant digits left in the end result .",
    "for this we made use of the ` gmp / mpfr / mpfrc++ ' packages .",
    "furthermore we made use of ` openmp ' to parallelise the operations .",
    "the lvy processes used in this section are brownian motion with drift , brownian motion with drift plus exponentially distributed jumps ( kou model ) and the @xmath41-class , see section [ sec_example ] .    the figures [ fig : lambdavalue ] and [ fig : lambdabound ] contain different value functions and its boundary points for processes of the @xmath41-class .",
    "we compare different values of @xmath288 which are responsible for the small jump behaviour .",
    "one process is similar to a cgmy process ( @xmath289 , finite variation and infinite activity , see @xcite ) .",
    "the other processes have finite variation and finite activity ( @xmath290 ) respectively infinite variation and infinite activity ( @xmath291 ) .",
    "+     where the driving process @xmath0 is of the @xmath41-class with parameter values @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "the drift @xmath294 is chosen as the solution of @xmath295 .",
    "furthermore @xmath296 and @xmath297,scaledwidth=120.0% ]     , scaledwidth=120.0% ]    in figures [ fig : betasigmacompvalue ] and [ fig : betasigmacompbound ] the value functions and boundary points for a process of the @xmath41-class with infinite variation and infinite activity are plotted for different values of the gaussian coefficient @xmath298 .",
    "if we compare over certain intervals @xmath299 , @xmath300 the curves of the value functions and boundary points for different @xmath301 and @xmath302 , @xmath303 we observe the following",
    ". if the curve of the value function for @xmath301 is steeper on @xmath299 than the one for a different @xmath302 , then the curve of the boundary points for @xmath301 appears to be more flat on that interval and vice versa .",
    "this is in accordance to general optimal stopping theory .",
    "note that for @xmath198 there seems to be a jump in the boundary at @xmath304 , that is figure [ fig : betasigmacompbound ] indicates that @xmath305 if @xmath198 while @xmath306 if @xmath285 .",
    "this is consistent with the observation in @xcite .     where the driving process @xmath0 is of the @xmath41-class with infinite variation and infinite activity .",

    "hereby we compare the relative difference between the value functions for several @xmath48 and @xmath49 with a constant ratio @xmath311 .     and",
    "@xmath312 ; @xmath313 and @xmath314 ; @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",

    "is taken as the base . the underlying @xmath41-class process with infinite variation and infinite activity has the following parameters : @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "the drift @xmath294 is chosen as the solution of @xmath295 .",

    "the authors are very grateful to alexey kuznetsov , andreas kyprianou and antonio murillo salas for very useful discussions & suggestions , and to the it services team at the university of manchester for their support in computer questions .",
    "this appendix contains expressions for the coefficients that appear in proposition [ prop_put_form ] , recursively in @xmath49 for some @xmath100 fixed .",
    "recall that the starting point for the recursion is ( [ formula_vk ] ) for @xmath322 , which contains only one coefficient , namely @xmath323 . throughout the sequel ,",
