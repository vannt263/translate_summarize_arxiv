    "pre - planetary nebulae ( ppns )  objects in transition between the asymptotic giant branch and planetary nebula ( pn ) phases  hold the key to some of the most vexing problems in our understanding of these very late stages of stellar evolution for intermediate mass ( @xmath8 ) stars .",
    "observationally , pns show a dazzling variety of morphologies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas agb stars are surrounded by roughly spherical gas - dust envelopes due to dense , slow stellar winds ejected with rates up to 10@xmath9(e.g .",
    "* ) . in the short transition period between the agb and pn phases ,",
    "these objects turn on very fast winds ( with speeds of a few@xmath10100 to @xmath112000 ) which interact violently with the surrounding envelopes , and drastically modify their spatio - kinematic structures .",
    "the nature and origin of such outflows remains unknown , and their interaction with the ambient circumstellar material and the consequent changes in the kinematics and morphology of the circumstellar material are very poorly understood .",
    "x - ray ( 0.1 - 10 kev ) observations can probe the direct signature of the interaction of the fast and slow winds , i.e. the very hot ( 10@xmath12k ) gas which should be produced in the shocked region . as a result ,",
    "many searches for x - ray emission from pns have been conducted beginning with the einstein observatory ( mid-1980s ) , followed by exosat and rosat , and continue now with cxo and xmm - newton .",
    "prior to rosat , most x - rays in pns were interpreted as coming from the hot ( 1 - 2@xmath13k ) central star ; rosat data led to the identification of _ diffuse _ emission from 7 pns but several of these were erroneous ( kreysing et al .",
    "1992 , guerrero , chu & gruendl 2000 ) .",
    "with cxo and xmm , extended x - ray emission from pns has been unambiguously imaged , and results have been reported for 5 objects ( bd+303639 , ngc7027 , mz3 : kastner et al .",
    "2000,2001,2003 ; ngc6543 : chu et al . 2001",
    "; ngc7009 : guerrero , gruendl & chu 2002 ) .",
    "these studies clearly show the presence of extended bubbles of hot ( @xmath1110@xmath14k ) gas , in qualitative agreement with our expectations from interacting - winds models .",
    "x - ray observations of ppns provide us with a unique opportunity to study magnetic fields , which may play an important role in shaping planetary nebulae ( e.g. balick & frank 2002 ) , indirectly ( acting as the collimation agent of the fast outflows : garcia - segura 1997 , gardiner & frank 2001 ) or directly ( magneto - centrifugal launching of disk winds : blackman , frank and welch 2000 ) .",
    "unlike most pns , the central stars of ppns are too cold to provide blackbody x - ray emission , thus detection of a compact central source of x - rays in a ppn could provide direct evidence for the presence of a strong stellar magnetic field .",
    "e.g. , by analogy with the solar dynamo , new agb - stellar - dynamo modelling @xcite predicts a strong field ( of few@xmath15 g ) near the base of the star s convection zone with a 0.2 yr decay half - cycle ( 11 yrs for the sun ) ; dissipation of this field should result in a non - thermal x - ray luminosity of @xmath16 ergs@xmath3 from the central stars in very young ppns .",
    "however , no systematic search for x - ray emission from ppns has been carried out to - date , because until very recently , it was believed that the wind - wind interaction responsible for shaping pns occurred during the pn phase ( through the interaction of a fast radiatively - driven spherical wind from the central hot white dwarf with an equatorially - dense wind from the agb phase ) . in this _ letter _ , we report our discovery of x - ray emission from the well - studied ppn hen3 - 1475 .",
    "this remarkable s - shaped object was selected as the prime target in our search for x - ray emission from ppns because it shows the presence of an ultra - fast outflow ( @xmath112300 ) @xcite , and bright optical knots of emission from shocked gas @xcite .",
    "we observed hen3 - 1475 with the chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) for 49.7 ks on 2002 july 15 , using the back - illuminated ccd s3 of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "the cxo / acis combination is sensitive over the energy range 0.3 - 10 kev .",
    "acis has a pixel size of 0.49@xmath17 , very similar to the width of the point spread function ( psf ) of the chandra mirrors .",
    "the data , consisting of individual ccd x - ray and particle events , were subject to standard processing by chandra x - ray center pipeline software ( ciao , version 2.0 ) , which determines the distribution of photon - generated charge within a 3@xmath103 ccd pixel box centered on the event position , flags events likely due to particles , and computes the celestial positions and nominal energies of incident x - rays . in order to optimize image resolution ,",
    "the event charge distributions were used , along with the telescope pointing history and nominal photon energies , to calculate a subpixel position for each x - ray @xcite .",
    "the cxo / acis - s3 image of hen3 - 1475 ( fig . [ f1_x_oiii_nii ] ) shows the presence of compact emission coincident with the brightest optical knot in this object ( nw1a in fig . 1 , @xcite ) , as seen in a hubble space telescope ( hst ) image taken with the wide field & planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in the [ oiii ] ( f502n ) filter .",
    "the relative registration of the optical and x - ray images has been established as follows : ( 1 ) the usno - b.1 catalog was used to determine the optical position of the central star in hen3 - 1475 ( @xmath18 , j2000 ) , and ( 2 ) the absolute cxo astrometry was used for the x - ray data , which locates the central peak of the x - ray emission at @xmath19 , i.e. offset by 20w , 14n from the central star .",
    "the peak of the optical ( nw1a ) knot is located 195w , 19n , of the central star .",
    "taking into account ( a ) the size of the optical knot ( about 07 along the nebular axis ) , ( b ) the sizes of the cxo psf and the acis - s3 pixel size ( about 05 ) , and ( c ) the uncertainty in the cxo absolute astrometry ( @xmath1106 ) , we believe that the x - ray emission and the optical knot are co - spatial , and thus physically associated .",
    "the probability of chance association of a background x - ray source with the knot is very small , considering that the optical knot covers only @xmath20 of a region of @xmath112 arcmin@xmath2 around the source in which there are only a few ( @xmath215 ) x - ray sources .",
    "the spectrum of the x - ray emitting knot is fairly soft , with almost all the flux confined to the 0.41.6 kev energy band ( a total of 63@xmath228 counts , corresponding to a background - subtracted count rate of 1.5@xmath23 cps ) ( fig .",
    "[ spec ] ) .",
    "the spectrum was extracted using ciao tools ( ver .",
    "2.3 ) , a 5 pixel ( 25 ) radius circular source region centered on the x - ray knot and a somewhat larger circular background region centered @xmath24 west of the source .",
    "the spectrum peaks around 0.85 kev , similar to the acis - s spectrum of mz3 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , two background sources in the vicinity of hen3 - 1475 have significantly harder spectra .",
    "we have fitted the x - ray spectrum with a model consisting of vmekal thermal emission plus ",
    "standard ism \" intervening absorption @xcite ; a value of @xmath25=2 is assumed for the latter @xcite .",
    "assuming solar abundances , the values of the plasma temperature kt and the source flux were varied ; the best - fit , assuming a 20% uncertainty in @xmath25 , gives a temperature , @xmath26k , and an  unabsorbed \" x - ray flux ,",
    "@xmath27erg @xmath28 s@xmath3 , where the lower ( upper ) limit for @xmath29 corresponds to the upper ( lower ) limit for @xmath30 .",
    "although the above model provides a reasonable fit to the observed spectrum , the latter shows an excess ( relative to the model ) around 0.65 kev . since oxygen ( o viii )",
    "can contribute to this feature via line emission at 19 , we have tried models in which the o abundance is allowed to vary freely .",
    "we find that there is a hint of o enhancement in the x - ray - emitting gas , but the signal - to - noise ratio is insufficient to determine abundances . unless , e.g. , fe is severely depleted in hen3 - 1475(as may be the case for bd+303639 ; maness et al .",
    "2003 ) , the best - fit value of @xmath30 obtained from the solar abundance model is likely to be reasonably accurate .",
    "the x - ray flux ( @xmath29 ) determination is fairly robust even if heavy metals are severely depleted .",
    "our derived @xmath29 gives an intrinsic x - ray luminosity for hen3 - 1475 of @xmath31 ( d/5kpc)@xmath2 ergs@xmath3 .",
    "using our model volume emission measure , em@xmath32 @xmath33 , and the electron density for the nw knot ( @xmath11 3000 @xmath33 ) from @xcite , we find that the x - ray emitting volume is @xmath34 @xmath35 , which is a small fraction of the optically emitting volume ( @xmath36 @xmath35 ) , as derived from the knot size ( @xmath1102 ) in the [ oiii ] image .",
    "it is not surprising that x - ray emission is detected only from the nw1a knot , since this feature is also the brightest and highest - excitation optical jet feature , by far , as seen in the [ oiii]@xmath375007 image ( fig .",
    "[ f1_x_oiii_nii ] ) .",
    "for example , the integrated [ oiii ] flux and the [ oiii]/[nii ] emission - line ratio of knot nw1a , are larger by factors 3.5 and @xmath382 , respectively , than the corresponding values for its point - symmetric counterpart ( knot se1a ) .",
    "the 1.4 mag of differential extinction between the knots ( @xmath25=3.4 for se1 knots , @xcite ) reduces the x - ray flux of the se1a knot by a factor 6.5 over the nw1a knot , insufficient to make it undetectable in our data .",
    "thus , the difference in the x - ray emission ( and optical emission ) between knot nw1a and its se counterpart probably results from a combination of differences in extinction and excitation .",
    "we do not detect a compact x - ray source towards the central star in hen3 - 1475 ; a conservative upper limit ( 3@xmath4 ) on the  unabsorbed \" x - ray flux and intrinsic x - ray luminosity , respectively , of such a source is @xmath39erg @xmath28 s@xmath3 and @xmath40 ( d/5kpc)@xmath2 ergs@xmath3 , using a temperature similar to that of the nebular source , and @xmath41 , the value used @xcite for the central source in hen3 - 1475 .",
    "since the extinction towards the center could be higher , and the distance to hen3 - 1475 is rather uncertain , our upper limit is not inconsistent with the value predicted by @xcite ( @xmath16 ergs@xmath3 ) based on their solar - dynamo analog for producing magnetic fields in the central stars of ppn .",
    "recent hst studies of the morphology of young pns and ppns strongly support a model in which fast collimated outflows begin to modify the circumstellar environment during the ppn phase and/or even earlier , during the very late agb phase ( sahai & trauger 1998 ) .",
    "our discovery of nebular 0.4 - 1.6 kev x - ray emission from hen3 - 1475 dramatically confirms the operation of the resulting violent post - agb wind/ agb wind interaction process .",
    "the simultaneous presence of both x - ray and optical emission in the nw1a knot supports the idea that the knots are strongly - cooling regions of shocked gas with very strong temperature gradients .",
    "the s - shaped distribution of the fast - moving knots in this object indicates that the fast post - agb wind consists of an episodic jet - like outflow whose axis has precessed with time ( precession angle @xmath2110  and a period @xmath111500 years , @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is supported by the theoretical result that a jet with a quasi - periodic variability and slow precession fragments into clumps which behave like  interstellar bullets \" @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the jet may intrinsically consist of a series of hypersonic bullets ejected by processes close to the surface of the star .",
    "@xcite have shown how the development of toroidal fields in a recently exposed ppn core could lead to an impulsive deposition of flow energy into a collimated system .",
    "whatever their origin , recent work by @xcite has shown that hypersonic bullets are capable of recovering key aspects of many ppn flows .",
    "the temperatures deduced from the x - ray measurements could be achieved with shock velocities at the surface of the bullet of @xmath42 = 470  .",
    "note that although this speed is lower than that derived for the knots from observations @xcite , the relevant speed for comparison is that of the shock transmitted into the high density bullet , which will be lower than the bow shock speed .",
    "it is also possible that the bullet responsible for the x - ray knot will be moving into a medium which itself has been set into motion by the preceding bullet , leading to lower shock speeds .    if , however , the jet is a continuous flow , then the optical shape of the x - ray knot and its coincidence with the x - ray emission leads to another interesting possibility .",
    "the narrowing of the flow at the knot in hen3 - 1475 is not seen in other jet - producing environments and has been noted as a potential example of a  conical converging flow \" in which material is inertially focused by the walls of an axisymmetric cavity to converge at a point where shocks redirect the material into a jet @xcite .",
    "recent laboratory experiments have shown such flows to capable of producing remarkably stable jets @xcite .",
    "while the s - shaped symmetry evident in he3 - 1475 makes pure hydrodynamic collimation unlikely , the presence of toroidal magnetic fields may produce conically converging flows in a similar manner which would also show x - rays at the convergence point .",
    "in fact , hen3 - 1475 is the first case of unambiguously shock - excited x - ray emitting gas to be detected by cxo that is unresolved ( e.g. , all of the pns detected by cxo show resolved nebular x - ray emission ) .",
    "the various jet models for hen3 - 1475 described above need to be tested using detailed ( magneto)hydrodynamic simulations to quantitatively fit the observed x - ray and optical ( line ) fluxes and spectra .",
