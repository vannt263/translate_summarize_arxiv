    "charge coupled devices ( ccds ) have been playing an important role in the modern x - ray astronomy ( lumb et al . 1991 ) since the sxt ( soft x - ray telescope ; @xcite ) mounted on yohkoh . as a photon - counting detector ,",
    "the first successful use of it in space was realized with the sis ( solid - state imaging spectrometer ; burke et al .",
    "1991 ) on board the asca satellite .",
    "the fifth japanese x - ray satellite suzaku ( @xcite ) also carries the ccd devices , the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; @xcite ) , located at the foci of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) modules , as well as a non - imaging hard x - ray instrument , the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; @xcite ) .",
    "the xis covers soft x - rays from 0.2 to 12 kev , while the hxd covers from 10 to 600 kev .",
    "the wide - band coverage by a combination of these instruments is a key competence of suzaku .",
    "sources that have rich statistics in the hxd are usually bright in the xis as well . in observations of such a bright source ,",
    "more than one photon can strike the same ccd pixel , or one of its immediate neighbors during the exposure time per frame .",
    "it causes a complicated and irreversible phenomenon called `` pileup '' .",
    "for example , when two photons with energies of @xmath0 and @xmath1 fall in the same pixel within an integration period , it is impossible to distinguish them from one with an energy of @xmath2 .",
    "it affects obtained spectra , images , and light curves .",
    "incorrect evaluation of pileup can lead to wrong interpretations of the data .",
    "this is especially the case for bright sources because their small statistical uncertainty can be overwhelmed by systematic uncertainties brought by pileup .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand pileup effects in order to maximize the wide - band capability of suzaku .    in general , when pileup occurs , flux and spectra become lower and harder , respectively .",
    "the pileup effects of the siss of asca , have been studied by @xcite , @xcite , and kotani et al .",
    "recently , a detailed study for the ccd detector of chandra , the acis , as well as a generalized formula of the pileup , has been compiled by davis ( 2001 ) . however , the telescopes used for the xis and the acis are entirely different in the shape and size of the point spread function ( psf ) , which adds non - linear complications to the effect .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to simply apply methods developed for the acis to the xis .",
    "likewise , the way of estimating pileup for the ccd detector of xmm - newton , the epic , can not be directly applied to the xis .",
    "thus , studies on the pileup effects should be performed specifically for the combined system of xiss and xrts .",
    "one of the practical solutions to mitigate the pileup in the xis is the `` core - exclusion '' method , in which the central region of the psf is excluded to avoid the ccd region severely affected by pileup .",
    "this method was adopted in the analysis of 4u  1630@xmath3472 ( kubota et al . 2007 ) , cygnus x-1 ( makishima et al . 2008 ) , gx 339@xmath34 ( yamada et al . 2009 ) , and others .",
    "based on these experiences , we released a recipe to apply the method for xis data as an official document . in the document , it is poorly stated how to estimate the size of the core to be excluded .",
    "this is often difficult to do by using data that are affected by pileup .    in this paper , we present the results of a systematic analysis for several bright sources affected by pileup in the xis . a brief summary on pileup characteristic for phenomenological specific to the xis+xrt system is presented in section 2 . after describing target selection and data processing in section 3 , systematic studies on pileup effects",
    "are presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    ", we discuss a criterion that utilizes pileup fraction and show concrete examples for the application .",
    "the main results of the paper are summarized in section 6 .",
    "pileup itself is intrinsically a simple phenomenon .",
    "however , it is complicated by the following realistic issues :    * sizes of charge clouds and pixels , * grade selection both in orbit and on ground , * the psf of the x - ray mirror , * the exposure time per frame , or `` snap time '' .",
    "therefore , the pileup should not be separated from the instrumental issues , the x - ray mirror , and data - processing specifics .",
    "when an incident photon is photo - absorbed by a si atom in the ccd pixel , photo electrons create a charge cloud that expands by diffusion along the way to the electrode , where the distribution of charges depends on both the absorption depth and the size of the pixel . for any ccd detectors , the distributed pattern of the charge cloud,``grade '' ,",
    "is used to distinguish between x - ray and non x - ray events .",
    "the pattern changes as pileup becomes more severe .",
    "as easily expected , single pixel events are less likely affected by pileup than multiple pixel events .",
    "if all charge clouds created by a single photon were much smaller than 1 pixel , then it would be much easier to reconstruct events .",
    "however , in reality , when an incident photon falls into a border of pixels , the charge clouds extend larger than 1 pixel , up to four pixels .",
    "thus , we must consider issues specific to instruments to assess pileup effects .",
    "in addition to detailed information on the xis described in @xcite , some features related to pileup effects in the xis and xrt systems are summarized .",
    "the xis system consists of four ccd detectors ( xis0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "xis0 , 2 , and 3 have front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds , while xis1 contains a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd .",
    "the depletion layers of the fi and bi ccd are @xmath4 m and @xmath5 m , respectively .",
    "xis2 has been dysfunctional since november 2006 . among the remaining ccds ,",
    "xis3 is almost identical to xis0 , while xis1 is different .",
    "therefore , we treat xis0(3 ) and xis1 differently throughout this paper , unless otherwise noted .",
    "events with grade 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 are regarded as x - ray events , while events with other grades as cosmic - ray events ( see koyama et al . 2007 and figure 4 of yamaguchi et al .",
    "the grade 1 and 5 events are charge distribution called `` detached events '' . as",
    "pileup becomes more severe , more x - ray events are regarded as grade 1 , 5 , and 7 , because of the overlaid distributions of multiple charge clouds .",
    "note that , in the case of the normal clocking mode , the xis has three editing modes , 2@xmath62 , 3@xmath63 and 5@xmath65 , which means that the pulse height values of the number of pixels are sent as a telemetry .",
    "the event detection algorithm is , however , common to all the editing modes ; the central pixel and the surrounding 8 pixels are used to detect an event on orbit . on the other hand ,",
    "the grading algorithm utilizes not only the 3x3 pixels of the event but also outer pixels , whose details depend on the editing modes . note that most x - ray events , which are photo - absorbed not in neutral region but in a depletion layer , are not split into a region larger than 2@xmath62 pixels .",
    "the pileup effects primarily depend on one parameter , the number of counts per snap time in a detection cell . in the case of the xis ,",
    "the number of detection cells is nine ( 3@xmath63 ) ; i.e. , the central pixel and the surrounding 8 pixels are used to detect the event in orbit .",
    "efforts to mitigate pileup in the xis are thus divided largely into two : ( 1 ) to reduce the effective frame time ( snap time ) by partial read of the ccd and ( 2 ) to use events in the outskirts of the psf , in which the surface brightness is lower than that at the core .",
    "each xis has two clocking modes : p - sum and normal . throughout this paper , we treat data taken only with the latter mode .",
    "snap time is basically 8 s in the normal clocking mode .",
    "the xis has two options that make the snap time shorter than 8 s to reduce counts per a frame time .",
    "one of them is the window option , in which only a certain part of the ccd , called window , is used for readout .",
    "the other is the burst option , in which the snap time can be shortened arbitrarily by discarding events arriving in a certain period during a frame time .",
    "an interval between the end of the snap time and the start of the next one is called `` delayed time '' .",
    "the delayed time is 0 s when the burst option is off , while it becomes longer than 0 s when the burst option is employed .",
    "the window and burst options can be applied independently for each sensor .    the combination of the xis and the xrt provides a spatial resolution of @xmath7 in a half - power diameter ( hpd ) .",
    "note that one pixel of the xis corresponds to @xmath8 .",
    "the field - of - view ( fov ) is @xmath9 at the maximum , which becomes smaller when a window option is used ; @xmath10 for 1/4 window option , and @xmath11 for 1/8 window option .",
    "due to the attitude fluctuation and calibration uncertainties , the 1/4 window is recommended over the 1/8 window option . in many cases ,",
    "a combination of the 1/4 window and burst options is used to mitigate the pileup .",
    "a rule of thumb for the count rate to cause a possible pileup for point sources for the normal full window mode is @xmath12 s@xmath13 ( see 7.9.1 of suzaku technical description ) .",
    "the xis+xrt system has two features that make the core - extraction method practically viable ; ( 1 ) energy - independence of the psf shape @xcite , and ( 2 ) heavy over - sampling . in other words",
    ", we can perform experiments of changing the surface brightness just by employing the different extraction radius from the psf core , keeping the other instrumental responses unchanged .",
    "the ccd detectors onboard chandra and xmm - newton lack either or both of the two features , which makes the application and validation of the method more complicated .      as a result of convolving mirror and detector responses with piled - up events ,",
    "the following observational features appear .",
    "* image * + the observed peak of the psf is smeared out .",
    "the smearing is often difficult to distinguish from the psf core flattening due to the thermal wobbling ( uchiyama et al .",
    "2008 ) . in some cases ,",
    "a hole at the center is created by the two reasons : ( 1 ) an event is regarded as an non x - ray grade due to many events falling around it , and ( 2 ) when , pileup becomes more severe , a sum of pulse height of piled - up events exceeds an upper threshold used to determine an event , and it is not regarded as an event .    * spectra * + the measured count rate decreases in lower energy ranges , while it increases in the higher energy ranges , which artificially creates a hard tail in the spectrum . since this feature is convolved with the intrinsic spectra , it appears more clearly in a source with softer spectra than one with harder spectra ,    * light curves * + when the flux of the source changes during an observation , the light curve can become plateaued at the peak .    *",
    "grade * + the branching ratio among the grades can change .",
    "in general , pileup decreases single - pixel events ( grade 0 ) and increase multiple - pixel events ( grade 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , and 7 ) .",
    "the extents of these phenomena depend on incident flux and spectra of a source . based on these observational clues ,",
    "we construct reliable criteria to judge and exclude the pileup effects .      in order to characterize the degree of pileup",
    ", we use the pileup fraction @xmath14 following davis et al .",
    "the definition of @xmath15 is the ratio of @xmath16 to @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the poisson distribution function , @xmath19 is defined as the mean counts per snap time per detection cell , and @xmath20 is the actual number of photons falling per snap time per detection cell .",
    "it is expressed as @xmath21 we expanded the equation by the second order of @xmath19 since @xmath19 is in many cases smaller than one .",
    "the theoretical value of @xmath22 can be derived by substituting @xmath19 with the incident count . however , when pileup occurs , the incident count is unknown from the data .",
    "therefore , we use the observed piled - up counts ( @xmath23 ) and an observed pileup fraction @xmath24 as a proxy for a theoretical one @xmath22 .",
    "to perform a systematic study on pileup , we need to select as many point sources as possible to cover wide ranges of brightness of photons and intrinsic hardness , because the extent of pileup is determined by the former , while the appearance of pileup effects is sensitive to the latter .    the list of the targets , as well as observational parameters of these sources ( e.g. , the snap and delayed times ) are summarized in table [ sample ] .",
    "these meet the following criteria : ( 1 ) brighter than @xmath25 1 mcrab and ( 2 ) small variability with a root mean square of the count rate smaller than 30% of its mean .",
    "the latter criterion is needed to avoid highly varying sources , in which pileup effects are difficult to disentangle with varying flux and spectra .",

    "* the values are unconstrained and are fixed to the value at the lowest bound .      to study uncertainties by using a region outside @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "we have compared spectra of the xis0 , taken from the observation of cyg x-1 on june 2009 in table 1 , which is the most severely affected by pileup among the 25 observations of cyg x-1 in the low / hard state ( for details see yamada 2011 ) .",
    "as shown in table 2 , the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the xis0 are 46 and 88 pixels , respectively .",
    "figure [ pl31check ] shows the detector - response - convolved / deconvolved spectra accumulated from a whole ccd region , outside @xmath26 and outside @xmath27 .",
    "the spectrum outside @xmath26 is fitted with a phenomenological model of diskbb + powerlaw + gaussian , keeping the center energy of the gaussian fixed at 6.4 kev .",
    "the resultant parameters are @xmath29 kev , normalization of diskbb of 4.8 @xmath30 , @xmath31 , normalization of powerlaw of 3.6 photons kev@xmath13 @xmath32 second@xmath13 , and an equivalent width of 264 ev .",
    "the spectral ratio of the whole region ( blue ) to the model shows typical pileup features similar to the ratio in figure 2 ; i.e. , the moderate hardening , the apparent decrease in flux , and the spectral steeping at the highest end around @xmath337 kev . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral ratio taken outside @xmath27 ( red ) agrees with that outside @xmath26 ( black ) within @xmath25 5% above @xmath25 2 kev .",
    "thus , the spectrum outside @xmath26 is almost free from piled - up events .",
    "( 46 pixel ) and @xmath27 ( 88 pixel ) , presented in black and red , respectively . as a references ,",

    "( bottom ) the ratio to the model of diskbb + powerlaw + gaussian , determined with the black spectrum.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]          for mitigating pileup effect , the larger mask radius is the better .",
    "however , at a large radius , we encounter different systematic uncertainties . in order to investigate these",
    ", we used the dimmest ( obsid=402072020 ) among the 25 cyg x-1 observations ( see yamada 2011 for details ) . for the source ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 of xis0 and xis1 are 8 pixel and 35 pixel , and 10 pixel and 38 pixel , respectively . to illustrate systematic errors outside of @xmath27",
    ", we added @xmath35 , which corresponds to @xmath25 100 pixel , to as the mask radius and showed in figure [ arfcheck ] .",
    "the spectra outside 8 pixel ( @xmath26 ) are fitted with a model of diskbb + powerlaw + gaussian , which is compared to the other spectra .",
    "although all the spectra above @xmath25 2 kev almost agree with each other within @xmath25 510 % , while the spectra taken outside of @xmath35 ( green ) deviate by @xmath36% around 0.72 kev only for the xis0 .",
    "thus , it is likely that the deviation is caused by incomplete modeling of of the spatial distribution of the contamination accumulating on the ccd surface , because of thicker contamination in xis0 than xis3 .",
    "this illustrates that a larger mask radius for a smaller pileup fraction is not always better in spectral analysis .",
    "we thus recommend to use either @xmath26 or @xmath27 as a practical solution .",
    "we have comprehensively studied pileup phenomena of the xis , by analyzing the actually observed data for several bright point sources . using the surface brightness , the pileup fraction as the primary measure , we characterized grade - branching ratios of split events and detached events .",
    "we examined the effects on spectral analysis when excluding the central regions within @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "our results are summarized as follows :    * pileup causes spectral hardening in fi and bi ccds , as well as changes in the sharp spectral features such as atomic edges of instrumental response .",
    "the changes in hardness is not dependent on intrinsic spectral hardness .",
    "* pileup increases the ratio of split events by @xmath25 20% from a pileup fraction of @xmath25 1% to @xmath25 10% in both fi and bi ccds . on the other hand ,",
    "the ratio of the detached events increases proportionally with the pileup fraction by @xmath25 several orders of magnitude from @xmath25 0.1 and @xmath25 10 % of pileup fraction . *",
    "when surface brightness , spectral hardness , and split event ratio begin to increase , the pileup fraction starts to exceed @xmath25 1% , which illustrate that the pileup fraction can be a good measure for estimating pileup . *",
    "the relation between the measured surface brightness and the radius corresponding to pileup fraction of 3% and 1% , is useful to estimate the extent of pileup in a practical manner .",
    "* based on the observation of cygnus x-1 , the differences between the spectra accumulated outside @xmath26 and @xmath27 are less than 5% in the 210 kev and @xmath25 20 % in 0.52 kev .",
    "the latter might be caused by uncertainties of contamination modeling in the xis .",
    "thus , we have phenomenologically compiled the pileup effects specific to the xis + xrt systems and found a practical way of estimating pileup effects , which would be useful for those who analyze the bright sources taken with suzaku , and even with similar ccd sensors to the xis+xrt system , such as soft x - ray imager on board astro - h ( tsunemi et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
