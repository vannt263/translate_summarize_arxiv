    "nuclear energy density functionals ( edf ) presently provide the most complete and accurate description of ground - state properties and collective excitations over the whole nuclide chart . among the microscopic approaches to the nuclear many - body problem ,",
    "probably no other method achieves comparable global accuracy at the same computational cost , and it is the only one that can describe the evolution of structure phenomena from relatively light systems to superheavy nuclei , and from the valley of @xmath0-stability to the particle drip - lines @xcite .    in practical implementations the edf framework is realized on two specific levels .",
    "the basic implementation is in terms of self - consistent mean - field ( scmf ) models , in which an edf is constructed as a functional of one - body nucleon density matrices that correspond to a single product state ",
    "slater determinant of single - particle or single - quasiparticle states",
    ". the scmf approach to nuclear structure is analogous to kohn - sham density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "dft enables a description of quantum many - body systems in terms of a universal energy density functional .",
    "universal in the sense that , for a given inter - particle interaction , it has the same functional form for all systems .",
    "nuclear scmf models effectively map the many - body problem onto a one - body problem , and the exact edf is approximated by simple , mostly analytical , functionals of powers and gradients of ground - state nucleon densities and currents , representing distributions of matter , spins , momentum and kinetic energy . in principle",
    "the nuclear edf can incorporate short - range correlations related to the repulsive core of the inter - nucleon interaction , and long - range correlations mediated by nuclear resonance modes .",
    "even though it originates in the effective interaction between nucleons , a generic density functional is not necessarily related to any given nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) potential and , in fact , some of the most successful modern functionals are entirely empirical",
    ". of course it would be desirable to have a fully microscopic foundation for a universal density functional , and this is certainly one of the major challenges for the framework of nuclear edfs .",
    "because it includes correlations , the self - consistent kohn - sham approach goes beyond the hartree - fock approximation , and it also has the advantage of being a local scheme .",
    "its usefulness , however , crucially depends on our ability to construct accurate approximations for the most important part of the functional , that is , the universal exchange - correlation functional @xcite . in an  ab initio",
    "\" approach one might start from a hamiltonian that describes two - nucleon and few - body scattering and bound - state observables @xcite , or an effective field theory of low - energy in - medium nn interactions can be used to build approximations to the exact exchange - correlation functional @xcite . however , even if a fully microscopic edf is eventually developed , the parameters of that functional will still have to be fine tuned to structure data of finite nuclei .",
    "this is because data on nucleon - nucleon scattering and few - nucleon systems , or gross properties of infinite nuclear matter , can not determine the density functional to a level of accuracy necessary for a quantitative description of medium - heavy and heavy nuclei .    when considering applications , however , an important challenge for the framework of edf is the systematic treatment of collective correlations related to restoration of broken symmetries and fluctuations in collective coordinates .",
    "a static nuclear edf is of course characterized by symmetry breaking  translational , rotational , particle number , and can only provide an approximate description of bulk ground - state properties . to calculate excitation spectra and electromagnetic transition rates in individual nuclei ,",
    "it is necessary to extend the kohn - sham edf framework , that is the scmf scheme , to include correlations that arise from symmetry restoration and fluctuations around the mean - field minimum .",
    "collective correlations are sensitive to shell effects , display pronounced variations with particle number and , therefore , can not be incorporated in a universal edf . on the second level that takes into account collective correlations through the restoration of broken symmetries and configuration mixing of symmetry - breaking product states , the many - body energy takes the form of a functional of all transition density matrices that can be constructed from the chosen set of product states .",
    "this set is chosen to restore symmetries or / and to perform a mixing of configurations that correspond to specific collective modes using , for instance , the ( quasiparticle ) random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) or the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "the latter includes correlations related to finite - size fluctuations in a collective degree of freedom , and can be also used to restore selection rules that are crucial for spectroscopic observables .    an important class of nuclear structure models belongs to the framework of relativistic energy density functionals .",
    "in particular , a number of very successful relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models have been constructed based on the framework of quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite .",
    "there are important advantages in using functionals with manifest covariance @xcite .",
    "the most obvious is the natural inclusion of the nucleon spin degree of freedom , and the resulting nuclear spin - orbit potential which emerges automatically with the empirical strength in a covariant formulation .",
    "the consistent treatment of large , isoscalar , lorentz scalar and vector self - energies provides a unique parametrization of time - odd components of the nuclear mean - field , i.e. nucleon currents , which is absent in the non - relativistic representation of the energy density functional .",
    "the empirical pseudospin symmetry in nuclear spectroscopy finds a natural explanation in terms of relativistic mean fields @xcite . on a microscopic level ,",
    "it has been argued @xcite that a covariant formulation of nuclear dynamics manifests the true energy scales of qcd in nuclei , and is consistent with the nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry through the implicit inclusion of pion - nucleon dynamics in the effective nucleon self - energies .",
    "a covariant treatment of nuclear matter provides a distinction between scalar and four - vector nucleon self energies , leading to a very natural saturation mechanism .",
    "rmf - based models have been very successfully employed in analyses of a variety of nuclear structure phenomena , not only in nuclei along the valley of @xmath0-stability , but also in exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values and close to the particle drip lines .",
    "applications have reached a level of sophistication and accuracy comparable to the non - relativistic hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach based on skyrme functionals or gogny effective interactions @xcite .",
    "relativistic edfs have mostly been applied in the description of ground - state properties and excitation energies of giant resonance at the self - consistent mean - field level , taking into account pairing correlations in open - shell nuclei in the hartree-(fock)-bogoliubov framework , and performing consistent ( q)rpa calculations of small - amplitude collective motion . however , for relativistic structure models to make detailed spectroscopic predictions , symmetries broken by the static nuclear mean field must be restored , and fluctuations around the mean - field minimum must be taken into account . while symmetry restoration and configuration mixing calculations have routinely been applied with non - relativistic density functionals since many years , it is only more recently that this type of structure models have been developed using relativistic density functionals @xcite .    in this work",
    "we review recent advances in the framework of relativistic edfs and , in particular , the latest extensions that include the treatment of collective correlations .",
    "section [ redf ] introduces the general framework of redfs . in section [ dd - pc1 ]",
    "we review a class of semi - empirical functionals and , in particular , the functional dd - pc1 that will be used in illustrative calculations throughout this work . for a quantitative analysis of open - shell nuclei",
    "it is necessary to consider pairing correlations , and in section [ rhb ] we introduce the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov model for triaxial nuclei , with a separable pairing interaction .",
    "the treatment of collective correlations is reviewed and illustrated with a number of examples in section [ gcm ] ( symmetry restoration and configuration mixing calculations ) and in section [ h_coll ] ( collective hamiltonian in five dimensions ) .",
    "section [ summary ] summarizes the results and ends with an outlook for future studies .",
    "in conventional quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) @xcite a nucleus is described as a system of dirac nucleons coupled to exchange mesons through an effective lagrangian .",
    "the isoscalar scalar @xmath1 meson , the isoscalar vector @xmath2 meson , and the isovector vector @xmath3 meson build the minimal set of meson fields that , together with the electromagnetic field , is necessary for a description of bulk and single - particle nuclear properties . in the _ mean - field _ approximation the meson - field operators are replaced by their expectation values in the nuclear ground state .",
    "in addition , a quantitative treatment of nuclear matter and finite nuclei necessitates a medium dependence of effective mean - field interactions that takes into account higher - order many - body effects .",
    "a medium dependence can either be introduced by including nonlinear meson self - interaction terms in the lagrangian , or by assuming an explicit density dependence for the meson - nucleon couplings . the former approach has been adopted in the construction of several successful phenomenological rmf interactions , for instance , the very popular nl3  @xcite , or the more recent pk1 , pk1r @xcite and fsugold @xcite parametrizations of the effective lagrangian . in the latter case , the density dependence of the meson - nucleon vertex functions can be parameterized starting from microscopic dirac - brueckner calculations of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter @xcite or it can be fully phenomenological @xcite , with parameters adjusted to data on finite nuclei and empirical properties of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter .    at the energy scale characteristic for nuclear binding and low - lying excited states , meson exchange",
    "( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) is just a convenient representation of the effective nuclear interaction .",
    "the exchange of heavy mesons is associated with short - distance dynamics that can not be resolved at low energies , and therefore in each channel ( scalar - isoscalar , vector - isoscalar , scalar - isovector , and vector - isovector ) meson exchange can be replaced by the corresponding local four - point ( contact ) interactions between nucleons . the self - consistent relativistic mean - field framework can be formulated in terms of point - coupling nucleon interactions . when applied in the description of finite nuclei , relativistic mean - field point - coupling ( rmf - pc ) models @xcite produce results that are equivalent to those obtained in the meson exchange picture .",
    "of course , also in the case of contact interactions , medium effects can be taken into account by the inclusion of higher - order interaction terms , for instance , six - nucleon vertices @xmath5 , and eight - nucleon vertices @xmath6 and @xmath7^{2}$ ] , or it can be encoded in the effective couplings , i.e. in the density dependence of strength parameters of the interaction in the isoscalar and isovector channels . although a number of point - coupling models have been developed over the years , it is only more recently that phenomenological parametrizations have been adjusted and applied in the description of finite nuclei on a level of accuracy comparable to that of standard meson - exchange effective interactions @xcite .",
    "the relation between the two representations : finite - range ( meson exchange ) and zero - range ( point - coupling ) , is straightforward in nuclear matter because of constant nucleon scalar and vector densities .",
    "the klein - gordon equations of the meson - exchange model with meson masses @xmath8 and density - dependent couplings @xmath9 , are replaced by the corresponding point - coupling interaction terms with strength parameters @xmath10 . in finite nuclei , however , the problem is not so simple . because of the radial dependence of the densities",
    ", the expansion of the meson propagator in terms of @xmath11 leads to an infinite series of gradient terms . in practice",
    "this series has to be replaced by a finite number of terms with additional phenomenological parameters adjusted to low - energy data .",
    "a number of studies have shown that , both for finite - range and for point - coupling mean - field models , the empirical data set of ground - state properties of finite nuclei can determine only a relatively small number of parameters in the general expansion of the effective lagrangian in powers of the fields and their derivatives .",
    "it is therefore not a priori clear how to select the set of point - coupling interaction terms that will describe structure properties at the same level of accuracy as the meson - exchange models .",
    "the mapping of a phenomenological finite - range interaction with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings ( dd - me2 ) on the zero - range ( point - coupling ) relativistic mean - field framework was considered in ref .",
    "a family of point - coupling effective interactions was constructed with different values of the strength parameter of the isoscalar - scalar derivative term . in the meson - exchange picture",
    "this corresponds to different values of the @xmath1-meson mass .",
    "the parameters of the isoscalar - scalar and isovector - vector channels of the point - coupling interactions were adjusted to nuclear matter and ground - state properties of finite nuclei . by comparing results for infinite and semi - infinite nuclear matter , ground - state masses , charge radii , and collective excitations ,",
    "constraints were placed on the parameters of phenomenological point - coupling relativistic effective interaction .",
    "density functional theory ( dft ) is one of the most popular and successful  ab initio \" approaches to the structure of quantum many - body systems ( atoms , molecules , solids ) .",
    "probably no other method achieves comparable accuracy at the same computational cost .",
    "the basic concept is that the ground - state properties of a stationary many - body system can be represented in terms of the ground - state density alone . since the density @xmath12 is a function of only three spatial coordinates , rather than the 3n coordinates of the n - body wave function , dft is computationally feasible even for large systems .",
    "most practical applications of density functional theory use the effective single - particle kohn - sham ( ks ) equations @xcite , introduced for an auxiliary system of n non - interacting particles . according to the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite , there exists a unique energy functional @xmath13 = t_s[\\rho ] + \\int d^3r~v_s({\\bf r } ) \\rho({\\bf r } ) \\ ; , \\ ] ] for which the variational equation yields the exact ground - state density @xmath14 . @xmath15 $ ] is the universal kinetic energy functional of the non - interacting system .",

    "this is the kohn - sham scheme of density functional theory @xcite . by including correlation effects",
    "the ks framework goes beyond the hartree - fock approximation but , in addition , it has the advantage of being a _ local _ scheme .",
    "it is clear , however , that the usefulness of the kohn - sham scheme crucially depends on our ability to construct accurate approximations to the exact exchange - correlation energy .",
    "the true exchange - correlation energy functional is _ universal _ , i.e. given the inter - particle interaction , it has the same functional form for all systems .",
    "one possible approach is to develop @xmath23 from first principles by incorporating known exact constraints .",
    "another is empirical , a parametric ansatz is optimized by adjusting it to a set of data .",
    "the hohenberg - kohn theorem and the self - consistent kohn - sham scheme are straightforwardly extended to the relativistic domain @xcite .",

    "the energy and momentum scales characteristic of nuclei , the only degrees of freedom that have to be taken into account explicitly in the description of many - body dynamics are pions and nucleons .",
    "the behavior of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction at long and intermediate distances is determined by one- and two - pion exchange processes . as already emphasized ,",
    "short - distance dynamics can not be resolved at low energies that characterize nuclear binding and , therefore , it is represented by local four - point ( contact ) nn interactions , with low - energy ( medium - dependent ) parameters adjusted to nuclear data .",

    "we review a class of relativistic energy density functionals ( redfs ) similar to that introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite but , instead of using low - energy qcd constraints for the medium dependence of the parameters , a phenomenological ansatz is adjusted exclusively to data on nuclear ground states",
    ". this empirical approach , although guided by microscopic nucleon self - energies in nuclear matter , gives us more freedom to investigate in detail the relationship between global properties of a nuclear matter equation of state ( volume , surface , and asymmetry energies ) and the corresponding predictions for properties of finite nuclei .",

    "a wealth of new data from radioactive - beam facilities , the exciting phenomenology of nuclear astrophysics , and recent theoretical developments in related fields , have prompted important advances in theoretical nuclear structure physics during the last decade .",
    "the objective of this field is to build a consistent microscopic framework that will , on the one hand , bridge the gap between the underlying theory of strong interactions and the phenomenology of finite nuclei and , on the other , provide a unified description of bulk properties , excitations and reactions across the entire chart of nuclides .",
    "even though _ ab initio _ approaches , starting from a microscopic nuclear hamiltonian that accurately reproduces scattering and few - body data , have been very successful in the description of relatively light nuclei up to oxygen isotopes , and large - scale semi - microscopic shell model calculations are performed for medium - heavy and even some heavy nuclei in the vicinity of closed shells , at present the only comprehensive approach to nuclear structure is provided by the framework of energy density functionals .",

    "the latter feature is especially important for extrapolations to regions of exotic short - lived nuclei far from stability for which few , if any , data are available .",
    "for spectroscopic applications , however , the edf - based approach must be extended beyond the static mean - field level and models must be developed that include collective correlations related to the restoration of broken symmetries in finite nuclei , and take into account fluctuations of collective variables around mean - field minima .",

    "functionals have thus been developed that are expressed in terms of ground - state nucleon four - currents and scalar densities only , with short - distance correlations and long - range dynamics represented either by higher order powers of the currents and densities , or encoded in the medium ( nucleon density ) dependence of the coupling functions of interaction lagrangians .",

    "a related topic is the link between the framework of nuclear edfs and the underlying theory of strong interaction  low - energy qcd , which will include both nuclear matter and finite nuclei . at low energies characteristic for nuclear binding",
    ", qcd is realized as a theory of pions coupled to nucleons @xcite .",
    "the basic concept of a low - energy effective field theory ( eft ) is the separation of scales : the long - range physics ( pion exchange ) is treated explicitly , whereas short - distance interactions , that can not be resolved at low energy , are replaced by contact terms . in a non - empirical approach to nuclear nedfs",
    ", the eft - based derivation of exchange - correlation functionals in principle allows for error estimates , and provides a power counting scheme that separates long- and short - distance dynamics .",
    "even a non - empirical universal energy density functional will have to be fine - tuned to data on medium - heavy and heavy nuclei .",
    "this is because such a functional contains a number of low - energy constants that determine the strength of the leading short - range interactions .",
    "these constants can not be adjusted already from scattering and few - body data to an accuracy that enables a quantitative description of structure phenomena in complex nuclear systems . in principle",
    "any complete set of low - energy data , for instance experimental masses , can be used to fine - tune the edf . however , when only a small number of nuclei is considered , satisfactory _ least - squares _ fits can be obtained with different , in general linearly dependent combinations of parameters . moreover ,",
    "ground states of spherical nuclei that have mostly been used to adjust functionals or effective interactions , include collective correlations that can not be absorbed in a universal functional .",
    "another important issue concerns functionals that are used in models that go beyond the mean - field level and include collective correlations .",
    "for instance , if rotational energy corrections and quadrupole fluctuations are treated explicitly by angular momentum projection and configuration mixing , they should not at the same time implicitly be included in the functional , i.e. through parameters adjusted to data that already include these correlations .",
    "therefore , the parameters of such functionals must be adjusted to pseudodata , obtained by subtracting correlation effects from experimental masses and radii .    in the development of edf - based structure models that include collective correlations through symmetry restorations and configuration mixing ,",
    "relativistic functionals face the same challenges as their non - relativistic counterpart , i.e. skyrme - type functionals . for these models to be able to make spectroscopic predictions in medium - heavy and heavy nuclei , often characterized by soft potential energy surfaces , it is important to build accurate and efficient algorithms that perform a complete restoration of symmetries broken by the static mean field ( translational , rotational , particle number ) , and take into account fluctuations around the mean - field minima for very general shapes .",
    "an interesting recent development , which goes beyond the scope of the present review , is the extension of the relativistic ( q)rpa to the quasiparticle time - blocking approximation @xcite .",
    "this approach takes into account effects of particle - vibrational coupling and , therefore , enables a quantitative analysis of single - particle excitations in odd - mass nuclei and vibrational excitations . in particular , the dynamics of particle - vibrational coupling leads to an increase of the level density near the fermi surface , i.e. to an enhancement of the nucleon effective mass .",
    "the rqrpa extended by the coupling to collective vibrations generates spectra with a multitude of two - quasiparticle - plus - phonon states , that are important in the description of damping phenomena characteristic for giant multipole excitations , as well as in studies of low - energy modes in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "finally , interesting results could also be obtained by expanding nuclear energy density functionals to include non - nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that relativistic density functionals provide a natural framework for the description of hypernuclear single - particle spectra based on chiral su(3 ) dynamics @xcite .",
