    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is poised to begin exploration of the multi - tev energy frontier within the next year .",
    "it is widely anticipated that physics beyond the standard model will emerge at this scale , most likely via the production of new , heavy particles which may be associated with the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking . at the very least ,",
    "the scalar higgs boson of the standard model awaits discovery .",
    "new , heavy particles typically will decay rapidly into the known leptons , neutrinos , quarks and gluons . when the new physics model includes a dark matter candidate ( as in supersymmetric models with conserved @xmath0 parity )",
    ", this particle can terminate the decay chain . in this case",
    ", sharp peaks in invariant - mass distributions may be scarce ; they can be replaced by missing - energy signals . quite often then",
    ", the signals for new physics have to be assessed against a significant background of standard model physics .",
    "the better the background is understood , the better the prospects for discovery .",
    "once new physics is discovered , we will want to measure its properties precisely , via production cross sections , branching ratios and masses",
    ". a numerically precise understanding of the backgrounds and of theoretical aspects of luminosity measurement will be essential to this endeavor .    in some cases backgrounds",
    "can be understood without much theoretical input .",
    "for example , in the decay of a light higgs boson to a pair of photons , the signal is a very narrow peak in the di - photon invariant mass .",
    "the qcd background , in contrast , is a smooth distribution which can be interpolated easily under a candidate peak .",
    "however , many signals involve much broader kinematic distributions , with final states including jets and missing energy in addition to charged leptons and photons .",
    "a classic example is the production of a higgs boson in association with a @xmath1 boson at the tevatron , with the higgs decaying to a @xmath2 pair , and the @xmath1 decaying to a charged lepton plus a neutrino . for such signals , a much more detailed understanding of the backgrounds",
    "is typically required .",
    "many methods are available for computing standard model backgrounds at the leading order ( lo ) in qcd perturbation theory .",
    "for example , madgraph  @xcite , comphep  @xcite and amegic++  @xcite automatically sum tree - level feynman graphs for helicity amplitudes .",
    "other programs , such as alpgen  @xcite and helac  @xcite are based on ` off - shell ' recursive algorithms  @xcite . for these algorithms ,",
    "the building blocks are quantities in which at least one external leg is off shell ( in contrast to the on - shell recursion relations  @xcite described later in this article ) .",
    "these recursion relations were first constructed in the qcd context by berends and giele  @xcite , and applied early on to matrix elements for backgrounds to top quark production  @xcite .",
    "for quite a while , simpler processes have been incorporated into parton - shower monte carlo programs that provide realistic event simulation at the hadron level .",
    "these programs , including pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite , perform parton showering and hadronization .",
    "they implement an approximation to the perturbative expansion that resums leading logarithms .",
    "more complex processes are now being included in this framework , using leading - order parton - level matrix elements provided by madgraph or alpgen , for example , combined with a matching scheme  @xcite that avoids double - counting between the leading - order matrix elements and the parton shower . yet",
    "these leading - order results often have a strong sensitivity to higher - order corrections .",
    "gluon - initiated processes are particularly sensitive . for example , the cross section for production of the standard model higgs boson via gluon - fusion at the lhc is boosted by roughly a factor of two as one goes from leading order to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) in the perturbative qcd expansion  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , quantitative estimates for most processes require a calculation at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "ideally , one would also match such results to a parton - shower monte carlo as well  @xcite . for a growing list of processes ,",
    "this has been achieved , particularly within the program mc@nlo",
    "@xcite .",
    "nlo calculations require knowledge of both virtual and real - emission corrections to the basic process .",
    "the real - emission corrections are constructed from tree - level amplitudes with one additional parton present , either an additional gluon , or a quark ",
    "antiquark pair replacing a gluon in the lo process .",
    "they can be computed using the same tree - level techniques used for the basic process . in addition , we need a method for extracting the infrared singularities arising from integration of the real - emission contributions over unresolved regions of phase space .",
    "these singularities cancel against those in the virtual corrections or against counterterms from the evolution of parton distributions .",
    "several such methods have been developed for use in generic nlo processes  @xcite .",
    "subtraction methods based on dipole subtraction  @xcite are the most widely used today .",
    "a related subtraction method , based on so - called antenna factorization  @xcite , has even been extended to nnlo  @xcite . in this review , we will focus on techniques for computing the virtual one - loop corrections to processes .",
    "once the virtual corrections are known , their incorporation into a numerical program for the full nlo result is straightforward , because they do not need to be integrated over unresolved regions of phase space , and all of their infrared singularities will be manifest .",
    "the computation of one - loop virtual corrections for processes with multiple partons , plus electroweak particles , is the bottleneck currently limiting availability of nlo results .",
    "the state of the art for complete computations is processes with up to three objects  jets , vector bosons , or scalars  in the final state ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "a number of new approaches aimed at one - loop multi - parton amplitudes are currently under development .",
    "some are already producing results applicable to processes with four final - state objects .",
    "these approaches fall into three basic categories : improved traditional ( including semi - numerical )  @xcite , purely numerical  @xcite , and on - shell analytic  @xcite .",
    "the semi - numerical approach of ellis , giele and zanderighi  @xcite has already been used to compute loop corrections to the amplitudes involving a higgs boson and four external partons  @xcite , and to the six - gluon amplitude  @xcite .",
    "nagy and soper  @xcite have proposed a subtraction method for use in a purely numerical evaluation of one - loop amplitudes , and have evaluated the six - photon helicity amplitudes purely numerically  @xcite .",

    "@xcite have developed a combined algebraic / numerical algorithm for multi - parton amplitudes ; the algebraic part has been used to determine the rational parts of several types of amplitudes , including the six - photon amplitude ( for which the rational parts vanish ) .",
    "the full algorithm is also being incorporated into a nlo qcd framework by the grace collaboration  @xcite .",
    "a purely numerical approach combining sector decomposition and contour deformations has recently been used to calculate tri - vector boson production  @xcite .",
    "denner and dittmaier have developed a numerically stable method for reducing one - loop tensor integrals  @xcite , which has been used in various electroweak processes , but also in nlo qcd computations , including the production of a top quark pair in association with a jet at hadron colliders  @xcite .    in this review",
    "we describe on - shell analytic methods for one - loop computations .",
    "the ` on - shell ' terminology means that essentially all information is extracted from simpler ( lower - loop and lower - point ) amplitudes for physical states . in contrast",
    ", the conventional feynman - diagram approach requires building blocks with off - shell states .",
    "the on - shell approach effectively restricts the states used in a calculation to physical ones .",
    "the restriction falls on some internal as well as external states .",
    "the approach relies on three general properties of perturbative amplitudes in any field theory : factorization , unitarity , and the existence of a representation in terms of feynman integrals",
    ". an earlier form of on - shell methods was used to compute the one - loop amplitudes for @xmath3 partons and ( by crossing ) @xmath4 + 2 jets  @xcite .",
    "the latter have been implemented in the mcfm program  @xcite .",
    "more recently , all six - gluon helicity amplitudes have been computed ( primarily ) with these methods  @xcite .    on - shell methods",
    "provide a means for determining scattering amplitudes directly from their poles and cuts .",
    "perturbative unitarity , applied to a one - loop amplitude , determines its branch cuts in terms of products of tree amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the unitarity method  @xcite provides a technique for producing functions with the correct branch cuts in all channels .",
    "its power is enhanced by relying on the decomposition of loop amplitudes into a basis of loop - integral functions .",
    "matching the cuts with the cuts of basis integrals in this decomposition provides a direct and efficient means for producing expressions for amplitudes .",
    "it is most convenient to use dimensional regularization to handle both infrared and ultraviolet divergences in massless gauge - theory scattering amplitudes .",
    "we take the number of space - time dimensions to be @xmath5 .",
    "we can use fully @xmath6-dimensional states and momenta in the unitarity method to obtain complete amplitudes , at least when all internal particles are massless  @xcite .",
    "( in the older language of dispersion relations  @xcite , amplitudes can be reconstructed fully from cuts in @xmath6 dimensions because of the convergence of dispersion integrals in dimensional regularization  @xcite . ) in most cases , however , it is much simpler to use four - dimensional states and momenta in the cuts .",
    "this procedure correctly yields all terms in the amplitudes with logarithms and polylogarithms  @xcite , but it generically drops rational terms , which have to be recovered via another method .    the basic framework of the unitarity method was set up in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , generalized unitarity was introduced as a means for simplifying cut calculations , by limiting the number of integral functions contributing to a cut .",
    "these techniques were applied to a variety of calculations in qcd and supersymmetric gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "more recent improvements to the unitarity method , by britto , cachazo and feng  @xcite , use complex momenta within generalized unitarity , allowing for a simple and purely algebraic determination of all box integral coefficients .",
    "britto , buchbinder , cachazo and feng  @xcite have shown how triangle and bubble integral coefficients may be evaluated by extracting residues in contour integrals .",
    "this approach has been used to compute various contributions to the six - gluon amplitude  @xcite . very recently",
    ", forde has proposed an efficient new approach to computing these coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the four - dimensional version of the unitarity method leaves undetermined additive rational - function terms in the amplitudes .",
    "these rational functions can be characterized by their kinematic poles .",
    "an efficient , systematic means for constructing these terms from their poles and residues is to use on - shell recursion relations  @xcite , which were first devised by britto , cachazo , feng and witten , as a means for constructing tree - level amplitudes  @xcite . in a related development ,",

    "@xcite have investigated how to determine the rational parts of amplitudes from @xmath6-dimensional unitarity , extending earlier work  @xcite .",

    "finally , ossola , papadopoulos and pittau  @xcite have developed a new loop - integral decomposition method , which we expect will mesh well with generalized unitarity techniques reviewed here .    most of the recent development of on - shell techniques at one loop has focused on qcd amplitudes in which all of the external particles are gluons .",
    "amplitudes containing massless external quarks pose no inherent difficulty",
    ". the same basis of integrals can be used , and individual amplitudes should have comparable analytic complexity . however , they have fewer discrete symmetries , so the number of amplitudes that need to be computed is larger for the same total number of partons .",
    "amplitudes with external electroweak particles ( vector bosons or higgs bosons ) in addition to qcd partons are of even greater phenomenological interest .",
    "such amplitudes can also be built from the same basis of integrals .",
    "( for amplitudes with massive internal lines , such as in top - quark production , additional integrals are required . ) in this review , in order to simplify the discussion , we focus primarily on amplitudes with external gluons only .",

    "multi - parton amplitudes in qcd are functions of a large number of variables , describing polarization states , color quantum numbers , and kinematics .",
    "it is important to disentangle the dependence on all these variables to as great an extent as possible . in this section",
    "we focus on techniques for separating and simplifying the kinematic behavior .",
    "the polarization - state dependence may be handled efficiently by computing helicity amplitudes , using the spinor - helicity formalism for external gluons  @xcite .",
    "the color dependence can be organized using the notion of color - ordered subamplitudes , or primitive amplitudes .",
    "primitive amplitudes are defined for specific cyclic orderings of the external partons , but carry no explicit color indices .",
    "they can be computed using ` color - ordered ' feynman diagrams .",
    "such diagrams can be drawn on the plane for the specified external ordering of the partons .",
    "( there are also restrictions on the direction of fermion flow through the diagrams in loop amplitudes . )",
    "the color indices have been stripped from all the vertices and propagators for these diagrams .",
    "the full amplitude can be assembled from the primitive amplitudes by dressing them with appropriate color factors .",
    "for example , for @xmath7-gluon amplitudes , the tree - level color factors have the form of single traces , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is an @xmath10 generator matrix in the fundamental representation , for gluon @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the coefficients of these color structures define the tree - level primitive amplitudes @xmath12 . at one loop",
    ", the @xmath7-gluon color factors can be either single traces  with an additional factor of @xmath13 present  or double traces .",
    "the coefficients of the single traces , which would dominate in the large-@xmath13 limit , are given directly by one - loop primitive amplitudes .",
    "the coefficients of the double traces are given by sums over permutations of primitive amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "therefore we can focus on the coefficients of @xmath14 , which we denote here by @xmath15 .",
    "( elsewhere in the literature , they are often denoted @xmath16 , to distinguish them from the double - trace coefficients @xmath17 for @xmath18 . )",
    "the one - loop primitive amplitudes @xmath19 have the same symmetry under cyclic permutations of the external legs as the tree amplitudes @xmath20 .",
    "similar results hold when external quarks  fermions in the fundamental representation  are present as well  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to previous reviews  @xcite for a more complete description of helicity and color decompositions .",
    "in this review , we concentrate on methods for computing the building blocks , primitive helicity amplitudes , which are functions only of the kinematic variables .",
    "a key property of primitive amplitudes is that their singularities , branch cuts ( at loop level ) as well as factorization poles , depend only on a restricted set of kinematic variables .",
    "this set consists of the squares of sums of cyclically adjacent momenta , @xmath21 , where all indices are taken modulo @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , the singularities are determined by lower - loop primitive amplitudes in the case of cuts , and by lower - point primitive amplitudes in the case of poles .",
    "this reducibility suggests the possibility of developing a recursive computational framework .",
    "the singularity information can be accessed more easily if we define primitive amplitudes for suitable complex , yet on - shell , values of the external momenta .",
    "this simple observation came out of witten s development of twistor string theory  @xcite , and many subsequent papers sparked by that article .",
    "witten s work demonstrated a remarkable simplicity for tree amplitudes , and suitable parts of loop amplitudes , when they were mapped into the twistor space of penrose  @xcite in which twistor strings propagate .",
    "this space can be defined as a ` half fourier transform ' of the space of left- and right - handed two - component ( weyl ) spinors @xmath22 associated with a massless vector , @xmath23 .",
    "the left - handed spinors are fourier transformed , while the right - handed spinors remain as coordinates .    here",
    "we will not rely directly on any concrete properties of twistor space .",
    "however , two conceptual ideas from that work underpin our approach :    1 .   use two - component spinor variables as the independent variables for scattering processes , rather than four - component momenta .",
    "2 .   treat opposite - helicity spinors as independent variables . for real minkowski momenta",
    ", there is a complex - conjugation relation between the two .",
    "this treatment requires momenta to be generically complex .",
    "complex momenta are certainly not a new notion .",
    "wick rotation allows the analytic properties of amplitudes for real minkowski momenta to be deduced by continuation from the euclidean region , in which the time components of minkowski momenta are imaginary .",
    "similarly , the complex analyticity of the @xmath24 matrix , expressed as a function of the lorentz - invariant products @xmath25 , depends implicitly on having complex momenta @xmath26 . on the other hand , arriving at complex momenta by thinking of the spinor variables as fundamental , leads to new ways of organizing the kinematic properties of helicity amplitudes .",
    "the first hint that this approach might be useful comes from investigating three - point helicity amplitudes  @xcite , displayed in ( a ) . for real momenta ,",
    "an on - shell process with three external massless legs @xmath27 is always singular , because @xmath28 for all three pairs of legs .",
    "these conditions force the three momenta to be collinear with each other  if they are real  which in turn makes all kinematic quantities vanish . using complex momenta to define",
    "the amplitude for three massless particles is also not a new idea .",

    "we then rely on factorization , unitarity , and the existence of a representation in terms of feynman integrals in order to compute amplitudes .",

    "any diagram with four - point vertices can be obtained ( possibly in more than one way ) from a ` parent ' diagram with all four - point vertices replaced by pairs of three - point vertices connected by a propagator .",
    "diagrams with the maximal number of propagators inside the loop are thus ` ring ' diagrams , built entirely out of three - point vertices ; moreover , all external legs attach directly to vertices inside the loop , as shown in ( a ) .",
    "accordingly , when computing an @xmath7-point amplitude , we must consider loop integrals with up to @xmath7 external legs . we must also consider diagrams with fewer external legs attached to directly to the loop , but rather attached to a tree which in turn attaches to the loop .",
    "these will give rise to loop integrals with fewer than @xmath7 legs , but where some of the legs have momenta @xmath224 which are sums of the original external momenta , as depicted in ( b ) .",
    "the original momenta may be massless ( for gluons or massless quarks ) or massive ( for colorless heavy particles ) .",
    "the sums of momenta are in either case no longer massless ; @xmath225 may be either positive or negative .",

    "5.0truein    each trivalent vertex contains terms proportional to the momenta flowing through it .",
    "if we consider the vertices within the loop , some of the terms contain a factor of the external momenta ( or sums of external momenta ) .",
    "others contain a factor of the loop momentum @xmath226 .",
    "the latter give rise to tensor integrals , in which tensors in the loop - momentum appear in the numerator .",
    "the maximal power of loop momentum arises when every vertex in the loop gives us one power , so that we get an @xmath227-rank @xmath7-point tensor integral .",
    "the ( tensor ) indices on the loop momenta are contracted into external momenta or polarization vectors",
    ". we will refer to integrals containing no powers of the loop momentum in the numerator as scalar integrals .",
    "the above analysis holds equally well for gluons circulating in the loop as it does for scalar particles circulating there .",
    "( in fact , the contribution of a scalar particle in the adjoint representation of the gauge group accounts completely for the leading tensor - integral part of the gluon contribution . ) for contributions of quarks in the loop , the counting starts out a bit differently .",
    "there are no powers of momenta at the vertices , of course , but the fermion propagator , @xmath228 , supplies a factor @xmath229 proportional to the loop momentum . as the number of vertices in the loop is the same as the number of propagators , fermionic contributions again give us integrals which range up to @xmath227-rank @xmath7-point tensor integrals , as illustrated in ( c ) .",

    "we are left only with scalar integrals having trivial numerators , with up to @xmath7 external momenta .",
    "another option is to use not only external momenta in the basis , but also complex momenta built out of the associated spinors .",
    "the lorentz products of the loop momentum with these complex momenta can not cancel propagators ; but a judicious choice will result in their integrals vanishing . instead of expanding the external momenta in this basis , we could also choose to expand the four - dimensional components of the loop momentum . as we shall see in an example , this is particularly useful for evaluating one- and two - mass triangle and bubble integral contributions .",

    "consider the cut in a channel with momentum @xmath224 crossing the cut , where @xmath224 is composed of @xmath70 external legs and @xmath256 .",
    "the cut contains delta functions imposing the on - shell condition  ( [ deltaplus ] ) . by removing them ,",
    "we promote the cut to a full loop integral , @xmath257 here the tree amplitudes are on shell , and the sum is taken over the possible helicities of the internal legs crossing the cut . in the applications we will describe in this review ,",
    "the cut momenta entering the tree amplitudes in are taken to be four - dimensional .",
    "accordingly , we can use the spinor - helicity method to the fullest in evaluating them .",
    "the propagators in are the same whether the particle crossing the cut is a scalar , a fermion , or a gauge boson .",
    "the corresponding helicity projector is already present in the on - shell tree amplitudes .",
    "the loop integral , in contrast , is evaluated in @xmath6 dimensions .",
    "the integral reductions discussed in the previous subsection are algebraic manipulations of the integrand . to perform them on expressions given in terms of spinor products",
    ", we can complete the spinor products to form scalar - propagator denominators .",
    "for example , if external momentum @xmath235 appears right after the loop momentum @xmath226 , then we may write , @xmath258 if all denominators are converted to scalar propagators , then the numerators can be rewritten as functions of the loop momentum ( and not merely of spinors carrying the on - shell cut loop momentum ) . performing the integral reductions on this expression will decompose the integrand into a sum of terms , each corresponding to an integral in the basis  .",
    "we can then read off the coefficient of any integral from the term with propagators corresponding to the integral . in practice ,",
    "applying the full reduction machinery is not necessary ; appropriate partial - fractioning of the integrand with respect to the loop momentum accomplishes the same goal . as outlined below , an alternative approach for computing the coefficients , developed by britto _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , transforms the cut integral into a contour integral in spinor variables , which may be evaluated by residue extraction .    in a general amplitude",
    ", we can not detect all terms by looking in a single channel .",
    "for this reason , we have to look at all channels .",
    "some integrals contributing to the amplitude will appear only in a single channel ; we can simply read off the coefficient in that channel .",
    "other integrals will show up in more than one channel ; we can read off their coefficients in any of the channels .",
    "we must take only a single copy of the integral in the latter case .    within the basis used in",
    ", cutting the amplitude in a given channel isolates those integrals that have a discontinuity in it .",
    "the product of tree amplitudes @xmath259 , @xmath260 can be equated to a linear combination of cuts of a subset of integrals in the basis , as in . because the linear combination typically contains more than one integral , we have to identify the different terms on the left - hand side .",
    "one way to do this is by performing a partial - fraction decomposition , and then isolating different terms according to the propagators they contain .",
    "we will refine this isolation in the next subsection .",
    "one might worry that were we to use a dispersion integral to perform this reconstruction , the results we found would suffer from an additive ambiguity because of ultraviolet divergences in the integral .",
    "that is , one can add a branch - cut - free or rational function to the amplitude .",
    "such rational terms are indeed present in qcd amplitudes . they can not be computed using the four - dimensional unitarity approach described above . in the four - dimensional case ,",
    "the coefficients in the basis  ( [ basisequation ] ) are understood to have @xmath243 set to zero , and the basis only serves as one for the cut - containing parts of the amplitude .    as an aside",
    ", we note that in supersymmetric theories at one loop , rational terms are tightly linked to cut - containing terms .",
    "they can be deduced entirely from the integral functions determined within the four - dimensional approach .",
    "there are no missing terms .",
    "( in theories with @xmath261 supersymmetry , there are strong indications that the same result is even true at higher loops . )",
    "this result reflects the improved ultraviolet behavior of supersymmetric theories .",
    "there are two distinct on - shell methods for computing these rational terms , implicitly fixing this remaining ambiguity .",
    "( for other analytic approaches , see refs .",
    "one method , to be discussed in  , is to extend on - shell methods by making use of another universal property of amplitudes , that of factorization .",
    "the second method stretches slightly our notion of a physical state from four to @xmath6 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "if we take the sum over intermediate states in @xmath6 dimensions instead of four dimensions , we recover the entire amplitude with no rational ambiguity .",
    "these intermediate states are massless and transverse but in a @xmath6-dimensional rather than a four - dimensional sense .",
    "the latter method adds a third role to dimensional regularization , beyond regulating both ultraviolet and infrared divergences .",
    "there are two different ways of understanding how @xmath6-dimensional unitarity can capture the complete amplitude . from the point of view of dispersion integrals ,",
    "dimensional regularization makes the absorptive part of the amplitude ultraviolet convergent , and hence eliminates any additive ambiguity . from a more concrete point of view",
    ", every term in an amplitude must contain a power of @xmath262 , where @xmath44 is an invariant , in order to compensate the dimension of the coupling and keep the amplitude of fixed dimension as we change @xmath243 .",
    "( in an amplitude with only massless particles propagating internally , there are no masses to supply the required dimension . )",
    "the invariants @xmath44 that appear can be different in different terms of the amplitude . if we now expand the amplitude beyond @xmath245 , the epsilonic power @xmath262 will give rise to a term , @xmath263 which contains a discontinuity for @xmath264 .",
    "hence it will be detected in the unitarity cut in the @xmath44 channel .",
    "the rational terms can then be obtained by truncating the result to @xmath245 .",
    "the underlying feynman - integral representation forces them to come along with the @xmath244 cut terms .",
    "because the @xmath6-dimensional unitarity method effectively computes the amplitude to all orders in @xmath243 , it goes beyond what is truly needed for collider applications . it does not allow full use of the spinor - helicity basis at the early stages of a calculation , though of course we can still make use of the on - shell conditions in @xmath6 dimensions",
    "accordingly , it tends to require more computational effort than the combination of the four - dimensional unitarity method with the additional techniques for rational parts discussed in  .",
    "nonetheless it is conceptually useful , and can be useful in practice for lower - point amplitudes needed as starting points for the recursive techniques we review later .",
    "it is necessary to use this version of unitarity , of course , when one needs a quantity , such as a splitting amplitude , to higher order in @xmath243 .",
    "recent work  @xcite has shown how to apply spinor methods in this context as well , and should widen the applicability of @xmath6-dimensional methods .",
    "cutting propagators in an amplitude selects only those contributions that have the propagators present in the first place .",
    "we can think of this in terms of the original feynman diagrams for our target amplitude , where it reflects the observation that a diagram with a relevant propagator missing can not contribute to the discontinuity in the desired channel .",
    "we can also think of this in terms of the integrals in the basis .",
    "each original feynman diagram will produce contributions to the coefficients of several basis integrals .",
    "if the original diagram is missing a required propagator , none of the corresponding basis integrals will have it , and no contribution to the discontinuity will arise .",
    "even when the original diagram does have a required propagator , it will be present only in a subset of the descendant basis integrals .",
    "cutting pairs of propagators thus winnows the set of basis integrals down to those in which the pair is present .",
    "when we sew together two tree amplitudes to form the cut in a given channel , only those integrals that possess both cut propagators can show up in the result , and accordingly the given cut contributes only to the coefficients of those integrals .    as discussed in the previous subsection ,",
    "we must in general perform analytic simplifications on the cut expression in order to isolate the contributions of different integrals .",
    "this procedure will sort terms into contributions corresponding to different integrals according to the propagator denominators present , and will remove contributions to lower - point integrals .",
    "if we require the presence of additional propagators beyond the pair isolating a given channel , only a subset of terms will remain .",
    "that is , fewer integrals can contribute . requiring",
    "the presence of additional propagators , or equivalently cutting them , goes under the name of ` generalized unitarity ' .",
    "it corresponds , in the old - fashioned language of dispersion relations , to extracting the leading discontinuity of an amplitude  @xcite .",
    "in addition to isolating a smaller number of candidate integrals to consider , the additional on - shell condition splits one of the two tree amplitudes into smaller trees .",
    "we are thus sewing smaller and simpler expressions together , and will in general need to perform less algebra to extract coefficients .",
    "the ultimate refinement of this procedure comes when we require enough propagators to isolate a _",
    "single _ integral .",
    "this is possible for the box integrals .",
    "maximal generalized unitarity  cutting four propagators  isolates the coefficient of a single box integral as a product of four tree amplitudes , as illustrated in ( b ) .",
    "in addition , when we take the cut momenta to be strictly four - dimensional , the four delta functions freeze the loop momentum entirely  @xcite , @xmath265           [ ( \\ell - k_1)^2+i\\varepsilon ]           [ ( \\ell - k_{12})^2+i\\varepsilon ]           [ ( \\ell - k_{123})^2+i\\varepsilon ] } \\biggr]\\bigg|_{\\ell^d\\rightarrow\\ell^4 } \\nonumber\\\\ & \\longrightarrow&\\int \\mskip -2mu\\frac{d^d\\ell}{(2\\pi)^d }   \\bigl[f(\\ell ) \\delta^{(+)}(\\ell^2 ) \\delta^{(+)}((\\ell - k_1)^2 ) \\delta^{(+)}((\\ell - k_{12})^2 ) \\delta^{(+)}((\\ell - k_{123})^2 ) \\bigr]\\big|_{\\ell^d\\rightarrow\\ell^4 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & { 1\\over2}\\sum_{\\rm solutions } f(\\ell ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sum is over the discrete number of solutions to the simultaneous on - shell equations imposed by the four - dimensional delta functions .",
    "the coefficient of the desired integral is then simply the product of the four tree amplitudes , summed over these solutions for the cut loop momenta @xmath266 , @xmath267 where the implicit momenta are all external , and @xmath268 .",
    "the sum is normalized by the total number of solutions , which turns out to be two , including solutions for which @xmath269 may happen to vanish .",
    "the complete freezing of the loop momentum means that no further algebra is required , and the coefficient could even be evaluated purely numerically .    for many applications of , including all for less than eight external ( massless ) legs",
    ", there would seem to be a catch : some of the tree amplitudes , corresponding to massless external legs , will be all - massless three - point amplitudes . naively , these amplitudes would vanish .",
    "the quadruple cuts would vanish along with them , swallowing the coefficients with them .",
    "as we have seen in  , however , using complex momenta we can obtain non - zero values for these amplitudes .",
    "we can then treat them in the same way as higher - point amplitudes in the quadruple cuts , and recover the box coefficients simply from sums over appropriate products of tree amplitudes .",
    "indeed , as we shall see , because of the special properties of three - point amplitudes , the computation of coefficients of box integrals with massless external legs is even simpler than that of four - mass boxes .    in an approach based on maximal use of generalized unitarity , we will compute a larger number of cuts ; but each cut will be simpler , and will give the coefficient of a single integral directly .",
    "one starts with the box integrals , computing a separate quadruple cut for each different one .",
    "one turns next to the three - mass triangles , which can be isolated through triple cuts as was done in ref .",
    "the integrands emerging from triple cuts in general will also contain contributions to those box integrals sharing the same cuts .",
    "these contributions , and box - like terms which vanish upon loop integration , must be removed in order to extract the coefficient of the three - mass triangle .",
    "this can be done , for example , using the decomposition proposed by ossola _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , or by other methods .",
    "further developments here are possible and desirable ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the spinor - residue approach of refs .",
    "@xcite outlined below can also be used for this evaluation .",
    "the remaining terms come from one- and two - mass triangles as well as bubble integrals .",
    "the analytic forms of the one- and two - mass triangle integrals imply that the remaining terms can all be written as sums of bubble integrals , with coefficients that depend on external invariants and on @xmath243 .",
    "accordingly , they should be treated together .",
    "this part of the computation will make use of standard cuts , evaluated as described in the previous .",
    "1.4 truein    as an example , let us compute the coefficient of a box integral in the pure gauge - theory amplitude @xmath270 . because this amplitude contains five external massless legs , the relevant box integrals , which are found by collapsing a single propagator on the pentagon ring diagram , have precisely one external massive leg , and three massless ones .",
