    "the three primary decay modes of the @xmath5 are three gluons ( @xmath6 ) , a virtual photon ( @xmath7 ) , or two gluons plus a photon ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we expect these decay widths to vary as : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively . from the ratio of decay rates :",
    "@xmath12 one can determine a value for the strong coupling constant , @xmath13 .",
    "in this analysis we determined this ratio by measuring the number of direct photon and three gluon events from a sample of @xmath5 data .",
    "the cleo  ii detector is a general purpose solenoidal magnet spectrometer and calorimeter .",
    "elements of the detector , as well as performance characteristics , are described in detail elsewhere @xcite . for photons in the central `` barrel '' region of the csi electromagnetic calorimeter",
    "the energy resolution is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the shower energy in gev .",
    "the tracking system , time of flight counters , and calorimeter are all contained within a 1.5 tesla superconducting coil .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected on the @xmath5 resonance at a center - of - mass energy @xmath16 gev , and from the continuum region at a center - of - mass energy @xmath17 gev , just below the @xmath18 resonance .",
    "the latter data set is used to subtract out the nonresonant continuum events produced at @xmath16 gev .",
    "the event sample taken at the @xmath5 energy corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 62.5 pb@xmath19 acquired during two different running periods .",
    "the sample of continuum events chosen for our background studies corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 91.3 pb@xmath19 .    to obtain a clean sample of hadronic events , we selected those events that had a minimum of three good charged tracks ( to suppress contamination from qed events ) , a total visible energy greater than 15% of the total center - of - mass energy ( to reduce contamination from two - photon events and beam - gas interactions ) , and an event vertex position consistent with the nominal @xmath20 collision point to within @xmath21 cm along the @xmath20 axis ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath232 cm in the transverse ( @xmath24 ) plane .",
    "backgrounds due to radiative bhabha events with a converted photon ( @xmath25 ) are reduced by requiring the total shower energy to be at least 15% of the available center - of - mass energy , but not more than 90% of the available center - of - mass energy , as well as by rejecting events that have thrust values approaching 1.0 .    applying these cuts",
    ", we obtained @xmath26 events from the two @xmath5 data samples , collectively .",
    "to obtain @xmath27 , we first compiled an inclusive photon spectrum from the clusters of energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter . only photons from the barrel region ( @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the polar angle of the shower )",
    "were considered .",
    "photon candidates were required to be well separated from charged tracks and other photon candidates .",
    "the lateral shower shape was required to be consistent with that expected from a true photon . if the invariant mass of any two photon candidates fell within 15 mev of the @xmath30 mass , then both photons were rejected .",
    "photons produced in the decay of a highly energetic @xmath30 would sometimes produce overlapping showers in the calorimeter , creating a so - called merged @xmath30 . to remove this background ,",
    "an effective invariant mass was determined from the energy distribution within a single electromagnetic shower .",
    "showers whose effective invariant masses were consistent with those from merged @xmath30 s were also rejected .",
    "figure  [ fig:1s - incl ] shows the inclusive spectrum that results from these cuts as a function of the scaled momentum variable , @xmath31 .",
    "the dominant source of background photons is asymmetric @xmath30 decay . to remove this background , we developed a monte carlo simulation",
    "in which polar angle and event selection effects were implicitly included .",
    "modulo isospin breaking effects , one expects similar kinematic distributions between charged pions , which produce most of the charged tracks in @xmath5 hadronic decays ,  @xcite and neutral pions , which produce most of the background photons in the inclusive spectrum . by measuring the ratio of the true @xmath30 momentum spectrum @xmath32 to the charged track spectrum @xmath33 , the charged tracks themselves could then be used as a basis for simulating photons from @xmath30 decays .",
    "we therefore estimated the background due to photons produced in neutral meson decays as follows : for events that passed our selection criteria , we measured the ratio of efficiency - corrected @xmath30 s to observed charged tracks as a function of momentum .",
    "then , assuming that the angular distribution of @xmath30 s is the same as that for charged tracks , the 3-momenta of the charged tracks were used to generate the expected background spectrum from @xmath30 decays ( with the correct angular correlations implicit ) . the measured ratio provided the appropriate normalization .",
    "this approach had the advantage of being less model dependent than a monte carlo event generator , as the `` generator '' in this method was the data itself .",
    "it had the additional virtue that the absolute normalization of the @xmath30 background was simply determined by the number of accepted events .",
    "in addition to simulating the @xmath34 background , this technique was also used to account for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 $ ] contributions .",
    "figure  [ fig : charged : neutrals ] illustrates the corrected momentum spectra of these neutral mesons and charged tracks used to emulate their decays .",
    "contributions from long lived neutral hadrons ( neutrons , anti - neutrons , and @xmath38 s ) can also produce showers in the calorimeter .",
    "we used the lund / jetset 7.3  @xcite monte carlo simulation of @xmath5 decays to estimate the number of long lived neutral hadrons in our event sample and a detector simulation based on the geant  @xcite package to determine how often these `` residual showers '' would pass the photon selection criteria .",
    "it was found that these hadrons represented a small contribution , not exceeding 3% for any value of @xmath39 .",
    "a test of this background simulation method was performed using data collected from the continuum region , @xmath17 gev . using a set of ratios for charged tracks to @xmath30 s , @xmath40 s , @xmath41 s , and @xmath42 s measured at this energy",
    ", we generated a photon spectrum and compared it to the inclusive spectrum from the continuum . with the exception of initial state radiation ( whose contribution could be estimated from lund and geant monte carlo simulations )",
    ", the inclusive photon spectrum and simulated photon spectrum should agree .",
    "figure  [ fig : dkpvcon - mom ] shows this comparison .",
    "we observe good agreement over the full range of @xmath39 . only to demonstrate that the background contribution to the inclusive photon spectrum is well modeled .",
    "initial state radiation photons were automatically removed when we performed a scaled continuum subtraction to remove nonresonant contributions to the inclusive spectrum taken at @xmath16 gev . ]",
    "this analysis has three major sources of background photons : ( 1 ) neutral hadrons ( specifically , @xmath30 s , @xmath40 s , @xmath41 s , and @xmath42 s ) produced in @xmath5 decay , ( 2 ) neutral hadrons produced in nonresonant @xmath43 processes , and ( 3 ) radiative photons from the process @xmath44 . by subtracting the @xmath45 spectrum from the continuum data , scaled to correct for the differences in luminosity and cross section , we remove background from the latter two classes .",
    "the photon spectrum that we generated using charged particles collected at the @xmath5 energy simulates the spectrum from the first two background classes combined , while the spectrum generated using charged particles from the continuum sample simulates only the second class . by subtracting these two spectra after appropriate scaling",
    ", we isolate the background spectrum of indirect photons from @xmath5 decay . hence subtracting the resulting spectrum from the data",
    "removes the first class of background .",
    "figure  [ fig:1sinc+bkgd ] shows the inclusive @xmath46 spectrum for data taken on the @xmath5 resonance , with the different background contributions ( non - resonant hadronic  &  radiative photons , resonant hadronic photons , and residual showers ) overlaid . after subtracting these sources ,",
    "what remained of the inclusive @xmath5 spectrum was identified as the direct photon spectrum , @xmath47 .    to compare our data with predictions for the shape of the direct photon spectrum",
    ", we modified the theoretical distributions to account for attenuation and distortion from the finite detection efficiency and energy resolution .",
    "the most significant loss of direct photon events occurs at the high-@xmath39 region , arising from our requirement that an event have at least three good charged tracks .",
    "unfortunately , hadronization in this kinematic regime is poorly understood .",
    "we considered two different @xmath48 monte carlo models with two different hadronization schemes and used a photon detection efficiency from the average of the two models ( see figure  [ fig : gggamm - eff ] ) .",
    "the difference in efficiency between the two models was incorporated into our systematic error .",
    "trigger efficiencies have been evaluated directly from the data by determining the fraction of events passing a minimum - bias trigger .",
    "this efficiency , for all values of photon momentum considered in this analysis , exceeds 99% .",
    "as figure  [ fig:1sinc+bkgd ] illustrates , the inclusive @xmath49 distribution increases rapidly in the low @xmath39 region .",
    "this is due primarily to an overwhelming number of photons produced in @xmath50 decays .",
    "however , to extract the total number of @xmath51 events and obtain @xmath27 , we needed to integrate this spectrum along the entire scaled momentum axis .",
    "it was therefore necessary to rely on a model which fit well to that portion of the photon spectrum where the signal photons were clearly observable so that an extrapolation into the lower momentum , higher background region could be performed confidently .",
    "a number of attempts have been made to predict the shape of this spectrum  @xcite . in this analysis , we employed the model by field  @xcite for our integration purposes .",
    "figure  [ fig : field ] shows our photon spectrum with the background sources subtracted . to determine the number of direct photon events , @xmath52 , from this spectrum , the data points in the region @xmath53 were fit to the modified ( i.e. , efficiency - attenuated and energy smeared ) field model ; the only free parameter in this fit was the overall normalization . for comparison purposes , the modified lowest order qcd prediction ,",
    "system is treated as ortho - positronium decaying into three photons . ]",
    "normalized to the same area as the field model , has been overlaid . according to field s model , about 85% of the direct photons that are produced in @xmath8 decays lie within this portion of the momentum spectrum . according to our averaged detection efficiency of figure  [ fig : gggamm - eff ] ,",
    "about 15% of those events are rejected by our shower and event - selection cuts .    to determine the fraction of direct photons within our fiducial acceptance",
    ", we used a monte carlo simulation of the direct photon events , incorporating the qcd predictions of koller and walsh@xcite for the photon angular distributions as a function of momentum . according to their model , roughly 67% of the direct photons fall within our fiducial acceptance , @xmath54 .",
    "thus , our subtracted spectrum , within the limits of the fit and our fiducial acceptance , represents approximately 48% of the total direct photons produced in the @xmath5 data sample .",
    "after integration of the fitted field distribution in figure  [ fig : field ] and corrections for finite acceptance , our data yields a total number of @xmath47 decays , @xmath55 .    to determine the number of three gluon events @xmath56 from the number of observed @xmath5 hadronic events @xmath57 , we first determined the number of continuum events under the @xmath5 resonance ( @xmath58 ) from the observed number of @xmath18 continuum events @xmath59 , accounting for the dependence of the cross - section on @xmath60 : @xmath61 next , we estimated the number of vacuum - polarization events @xmath62 using the @xmath63 branching fraction @xmath64  @xcite , and @xmath65  @xcite : @xmath66 from these values and monte carlo determined efficiencies for the various event types to pass our event selection selection criteria ( see table  [ tab : evnt - eff ] ) , we determined    @xmath67    from these values we obtained a value for @xmath27 : @xmath68      catani and hautmann  @xcite assert that in order to determine the total photon spectrum from @xmath69(1s ) decays one must also consider fragmentation photons emitted from final  state light quarks produced in the initial heavy quarkonia decay . to properly measure @xmath13",
    ", they claim , one must account for these additional photons , both in the shape of the spectrum , as well as in the qcd equations from which @xmath13 is extracted .",
    "they also provide a leading order estimate of the shape of the prompt photon spectrum due to this fragmentation component . in our analysis",
    ", we added this same component to the direct spectrum predicted by field , modified the resulting spectrum for efficiency and energy resolution , and fit this distribution to our data using essentially the same method to determine @xmath52 as described above .",
    "from that distribution , we measured @xmath70 ( see figure  [ fig : catani ] ) .",
    "clearly , we do not yet have the requisite experimental sensitivity needed to verify the catani and hautmann model .",
    "table  [ tab : syserrors ] summarizes the systematic errors studied in this analysis and their estimated effect upon @xmath27 .",
    "the tracking efficiency and multiplicity modeling uncertainty was obtained by applying the two monte carlo models ( with their different hadronization schemes ) separately , as opposed to their average . including the @xmath30 veto reduces our statistical errors in the low @xmath39 region , but also adds to the uncertainty in our ability to accurately simulate this cut .",
    "the difference between the value of @xmath27 obtained by applying the @xmath30 veto and the value obtained when we did not apply this veto constituted our second largest systematic uncertainty in @xmath27 . by scaling the secondary photon spectrum by @xmath71",
    ", we obtained the systematic error due to our uncertainty in the overall normalization of the secondary photon spectrum .",
    "we also compared results by using a different subtraction technique in which the non - resonant radiative contribution was subtracted using monte carlo simulated continuum events generated at the @xmath5 center - of - mass energy .",
    "this allowed us to extract a value of @xmath27 independent of any non - resonant data taken at energies other than 9.46 gev .",
    "the estimated uncertainty in the number of three gluon events can be directly translated to an uncertainty in @xmath27 . to check against possible systematic effects due to different running conditions",
    ", we analyzed the two @xmath72 data samples separately .",
    "finally , we included the total error ( statistical and systematic , combined in quadrature ) quoted by argus in their measurement of the ratio of hadronic to muonic cross - sections , @xmath73 .",
    "table  [ tab : comps ] compares the results of this analysis with those obtained by previous experiments in which the observed number of @xmath74 events were also determined using field s model .",
    "we now relate the value of @xmath75 to the fundamental qcd parameters which we wish to measure , following sanghera  @xcite .",
    "the decay width @xmath76 has been calculated by lepage and mackenzie  @xcite in terms of the coupling strength at the energy scale characterizing this decay process , @xmath77 ) : @xmath78 .",
    "\\label{eq : qcd0}\\ ] ] expressing this ratio in terms of a leading - order power series in @xmath79 , we have : @xmath80 , \\label{eq : qcd1}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is the number of light quark flavors which participate in the process ( @xmath84 for @xmath5 decays ) .",
    "similarly , the decay width @xmath85 has been calculated by bardeen et al .",
    "@xcite and expressed by lepage et al .",
    "@xcite as : @xmath86 + \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot \\biggr ] ,          \\label{eq : qcd101}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , the charge of the b quark .",
    "again , we can express this in terms of the renormalization scale : @xmath89 , \\label{eq : qcd2}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "note that the scale dependent qcd equations  ( [ eq : qcd1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : qcd2 ] ) are of finite order in @xmath13 .",
    "if these equations were solved to all orders , then they could in principle be used to determine @xmath27 independent of the renormalization scale . because we are dealing with calculations that are of finite order , the question of an appropriate scale must be addressed .",
    "the renormalization scale may be defined in terms of the center of mass energy of the process , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is some positive value .",
    "but qcd does not tell us _ a priori _ what @xmath96 should be .",
    "one possibility would be to define @xmath97 ; that is @xmath98 .",
    "a number of phenomenological prescriptions  @xcite have been proposed in an attempt to `` optimize '' the scale . however , each of these prescriptions yields scale values which , in general , vary greatly with the experimental quantity being measured  @xcite .    in this analysis",
    ", we have determined @xmath1 over a range of scale values .",
    "this was done by comparing our measured value of @xmath27 with the ratio of equations  ( [ eq : qcd1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : qcd2 ] ) in which @xmath13 was replaced by the expression in equation  ( [ eq : qcd3 ] ) , thereby providing a relationship between @xmath1 , @xmath96 , and @xmath27 .",
    "thus for each assumed value of @xmath96 , @xmath1 was numerically determined as a function of @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 versus @xmath96 dependence is shown in figure  [ fig : qcd ] .",
    "this dependence was parameterized by the form @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the value of @xmath96 around which @xmath1 is minimally dependent on @xmath96 , given by @xmath101 .",
    "in this analysis , we determined @xmath102 , @xmath103 = 168.62 mev , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .    by parameterizing the results of the analysis in this manner",
    ", one can easily extract qcd parameters at any scale within the range of the parameterization , @xmath106 , and compare with other results .",
    "for example , the mean value between @xmath107 ( where @xmath1 is a minimum ) , and @xmath108 , is @xmath109 mev .",
    "the uncertainty of the parameterization due to the theoretical uncertainties of the parameters in equations  ( [ eq : qcd1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : qcd2 ] ) has been included in the systematic error of @xmath1 . substituting this value for @xmath1 into equation  ( [ eq : qcd3 ] ) , and using @xmath110 we find for @xmath13 : @xmath111 where the additional error of @xmath112 arises from the difference , about 64 mev , between the mean value of @xmath1 and the values at each of the parameterization limits , @xmath96 = 0.107 and @xmath96 = 1.0 . extrapolating this result to @xmath113 , and assuming continuity of @xmath13 across the 5 flavor continuum threshold  @xcite ( which implies that @xmath1 is a step function across the 5 flavor threshold ) , we obtain from equation  ( [ eq : qcd3 ] ) : @xmath114 this result is lower , although in acceptable agreement with the average value of @xmath115 presently quoted by the particle data group@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the value of @xmath1 obtained by previous experiments  @xcite using the fixed - scale procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite is in agreement with our value at @xmath100 where the scale dependence on @xmath1 becomes minimal .",
