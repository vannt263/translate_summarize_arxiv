    "the aim of the present work is to investigate the evolution of stellar x - ray emission during pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stages . to address this issue",
    "we have analyzed the high resolution x - ray spectra of two pms stars : the classical t  tauri star ( ctts ) , and the weak - lined t  tauri star ( wtts ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two stars allow us to probe different evolutionary phases .",
    "mass accretion is still present in as shown by its asymmetric and broad h@xmath1 emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested a possible infrared excess but this finding has been ruled out by subsequent studies ( @xcite ) , indicating that no longer harbors large amount of dust .",
    "the accretion process has just ended in which has a filled in h@xmath1 line ( @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the x - ray emission allows us to infer the characteristics of the emitting plasma including the thermal structure , the electron densities , and the elemental abundances .",
    ".characteristics of the star sample .",
    "negative values of h@xmath1 equivalent width indicate an emission line .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     we have used the density sensitivity of the intercombination and forbidden lines of he - like ions ( @xcite ) to investigate the coronal electron densities @xmath2 . in the observed x - ray spectrum of we have analyzed only the o  vii triplet , because the ne  ix triplet is blended with fe  xix lines and the rgs spectral resolution is insufficient to resolve these blends .",
    "on the other hand in the observed x - ray spectrum of we have analyzed the ne  ix , mg  xi and si  xiii triplets , while of the o  vii triplet only the resonance line has been detected .",
    "the o  vii he - like triplet for and the ne  ix triplet for are shown in figures  [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] , including observed spectra and best - fit line profiles ; the derived @xmath2 values are shown in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "we derive only upper limits for the electron densities from the observed @xmath3 ratio for all triplets except the mg  xi for .",
    "it is worth noting that these results are different from those of where high densities ( @xmath4 ) have been deduced from the analysis of ne  ix and o  vii triplets ( @xcite ) .",
    "the shape of @xmath5 , the abundance patterns and the electron densities derived from the x - ray spectra of and suggest that the x - ray emission from the pms stars analyzed is very similar to the coronal emission of more evolved active stars . in the following we compare our results with those of , and .      in figure  [ fig7 ]",
    "we compare the ne / fe abundance ratios ( referred to the solar value ) for these five pms stars sorted by h@xmath1 equivalent width .",
    "note however that we obtain a similar pattern if our stars are sorted by spectral type . shows the same ratio as , while the ratio is significantly lower for the other stars , characterized by no evidence of accretion .",
    "this finding suggests that the ne / fe abundance ratio may reflect the evolutionary stage of the relevant star , although this interpretation is complicated by the fact that more evolved stars , like the zams k0 dwarf , show again very high ne / fe values ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "while ne / fe ratios are also thought to be correlated with stellar magnetic activity , another possibility is that the higher ne / fe ratio of , and , which all belong to the tw hydrae association , reflects the initial abundances of the cloud from which these stars originated , although this would require rather large variations in local ism abundances .      in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we show the @xmath7 peak temperatures of the same stars .",
    "note that the value is only indicative because no detailed emission measure analysis has been performed on its data .",
    "this plot suggests that the temperature of the emitting plasma rises with the ending of the accretion process , although there are other parameter differences between the selected stars .",
    "in conclusion we have found that ne / fe abundance ratio seems to be correlated with evolutionary stages and with spectral type .",
    "in particular has the same ne / fe abundance ratio as . on the other hand",
    ", none of the sample stars shows the same densities and plasma temperatures as .",
    "we can therefore depict two scenarios : in the first case may represent cttss with ages @xmath8  myr , but still characterized by high accretion levels , while the other sample stars represent different evolutionary phases . in the second case , and/or its environment , may be quite different from the other cttss , and therefore it is not straightforward to reconcile its characteristics with those of the other pms stars ."
