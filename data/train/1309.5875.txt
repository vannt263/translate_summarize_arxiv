    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is powered by a mass accretion rate , @xmath0 , onto a central super - massive black hole of mass @xmath1 . to the first - order approximation ,",
    "as seen in the stellar mass black hole binaries , the state of the accretion flow is determined by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the efficiency set by black hole spin and the nature of the accretion flow , and @xmath5 is the eddington limit .    the highest eddington ratio accretion flows , with @xmath6 , are found in the subset of broad line agn known as narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nls1s , e.g. @xcite ) which have permitted line widths only slightly broader than those of their forbidden lines ( @xcite , boroson & green 1992 ) , indicating relatively low black hole masses ( @xmath7 : boroson 2002 ) .",
    "this combination of properties means that their accretion disc spectra should peak in the euv / soft x - ray bandpass rather than the far uv peak expected for more typical broad line seyfert 1 ( bls1)/qsos which have @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "however , it has long been known that the spectra of agn are more complex than expected from simple disc models .",
    "standard qso template spectra show substantial hard and soft x - ray emission as well as a ` big blue bump ' from a standard disc ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 ; richards et al 2006 ) .",
    "there is a power law which dominates in the 2 - 10  kev bandpass , and a soft x - ray excess over the low energy extrapolation of the power law emission which appears to be ubiquitous in all agn . the power law ` coronal ' emission is commonly seen also in black hole binaries ( bhb ) , but the soft x - ray excess has no clear counterpart in the stellar mass systems .",
    "this could be a true additional continuum component seen only in agn ( laor et al .",
    "1997 ; magdziarz et al .",
    "1998 ; gierliski & done 2004 ) , but the characteristic temperature of this component remains remarkably stable across objects of very different mass ( czerny et al . 2003 ; gierliski & done 2004 ) , making this solution fine - tuned .",
    "the only current alternative model in the literature is that the soft excess instead arises as result of reflection and reprocessing from partially ionised material ( crummy et al .",
    "2006 ; walton et al .",
    "the decrease in opacity in this material below the oxygen k and iron l edges at @xmath10  kev give a physical reason for the fixed energy of this feature .",
    "however , this requires similar fine tuning of the ionisation state of the reflecting material in order to always be dominated by the opacity at @xmath10  kev ( done & nayakshin 2007 ) .",
    "also , the strong soft x - ray lines predicted by this model are not seen in the data , requiring extreme relativistic effects ( high spin and highly centrally concentrated illumination ) to smear these into a pseudo - continuum ( crummy et al .",
    "2006 ; walton et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "these two very different ideas for the origin of the soft x - ray excess can be tested via variability . in the simplest reflection interpretation , both soft and hard x - rays are connected together by a single , partially ionised reflection component . instead",
    ", if the soft x - ray excess is a true additional continuum component , this does not extend into the hard x - ray band and the soft and hard x - rays are decoupled .",
    "previous work has addressed this via a range of different techniques mostly aimed at separating the spectrum into constant and variable components . in particular , the variable component can be quantified by calculating the excess variance in each ( binned ) energy channel ( edelson et al .",
    "these _ rms _ spectra reveal a bewildering range of shapes ( e.g. the compilation of gierliski & done 2006 ) .",
    "these appear to be correlated with complexity of the x - ray spectra .",
    "the _ rms _ spectra become more uniform after excluding nls1 which show deep x - ray minima ( these are the spectra which can be interpreted as being dominated by extreme relativistic reflection : gallo 2006 ) , and all objects where there is a strong warm absorber .",
    "then , the remaining ` simple ' agn show _",
    "rms _ spectra where the low energy variability is strongly suppressed .",
    "these are consistent with a two component spectrum , where there is a stable soft component dominating at low energies , and a variable power law which dominates at high energies .",
    "this is seen in both nls1 ( middleton et al .",
    "2009 ; jin et al . 2009 ) and bls1 ( mehdipour et al . 2011 ; noda et al . 2011 ; 2013 ) .    here",
    "we use an archetypal ` simple ' nls1 pg 1244 + 026 to further test these ideas on the origin of the soft x - ray excess and the shape of the sed .",
    "pg 1244 + 026 was selected by jin et al .",
    "( 2012a ) ( hereafter : j12a ) as one of the brightest un - obscured type 1 agn with both _ xmm - newton _ and _ sdss _ spectra . from an analysis of optical spectra ,",
    "pg 1244 + 026 can also be seen to have the narrowest h@xmath11 line ( 830 km s@xmath12 ) and the fourth smallest h@xmath11 equivalent width ( 41 ) of all of the pg quasars ( boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "previous x - ray observations of this source with _ asca _ revealed possible complexity around oxygen / iron l shell energies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but the data were limited . here",
    "we report on a new 120ks _ xmm - newton _ observation which allows us to study the spectrum and variability of the source in detail .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the data quality and our data reduction procedure for this new _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "then in section 3 we try various models to fit the 0.3 - 10 kev spectra and report the results .",
    "section 4 will focus on the variability of pg 1244 + 026 , especially the light - curve , power spectral density ( psd ) and the frequency - differentiated _ rms _ spectra . in section 5",
    ", we will present the frequency - dependent covariance spectra and discuss their properties . in section 6",
    ", we will discuss issues such as broadband sed and black hole mass .",
    "the summary and conclusions are in section 7 .    [",

    "in this paper , we presented a detailed spectral and timing analysis on a 123ks _ xmm - newton _ observation of pg 1244 + 026 , a nls1 with very narrow balmer lines and extreme mass accretion rate .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of pg 1244 + 026 contains a very steep hard x - ray power law and a strong / smooth soft x - ray excess .",
    "we show that the soft x - ray excess can be fit with an additional cool comptonisation component or by extremely smeared , partially ionised reflection , but that both models require additional blackbody emission at the softest x - ray energies .",
    "we then use a detailed timing analysis to distinguish between these two physical models for the soft x - ray excess .",
    "we derive the frequency - dependent fractional _ rms _ and covariance spectra . for the fastest variability",
    ", the _ rms _ spectrum has a clear soft excess , though this is smaller relative to the power law than in the time averaged spectrum .",
    "however , the spectrum of the variability correlated with the 4 - 10  kev lightcurve shows no soft excess over the same timescales .",
    "this clearly shows that the majority of the soft x - ray excess varies incoherently with the hard x - ray flux on fast timescales ( @xmath13  s ) . a similar drop in coherence between hard and soft variability on the fastest timescales",
    "has previously also been seen in ngc4051 ( m@xmath14hardy et al .",
    "2004 ) . here",
    ", combining the variability information with spectral models rules out a single reflection component making both the soft x - ray excess and the iron k line features as this predicts correlated flux variability in both hard and soft bands .",
    "however , it does not rule out more complex models , where there are multiple reflectors or some ( small ) contribution of ionised reflection to the soft bandpass as well as an additional soft x - ray component which emerges only below 1  kev .    by contrast , the spectrum of fast variability correlated with the 0.3 - 1  kev lightcurve has more soft x - ray excess than that of the hf _",
    "rms _ , as it includes all the soft excess variability seen in the hf _ rms _ which is uncorrelated with the 4 - 10  kev emission",
    ". however , the drop in hf 0.3 - 1  kev covariance below 0.5  kev confirms the reality of the separate blackbody component required from the spectral fits .",
    "thus the fast variability data are clearly consistent with the spectral model in which the soft x - ray excess is a separate comptonised component which provides the seed photons for the higher energy power law emission , but where the very softest energies are dominated by the disc itself .",
    "conversely , it is inconsistent with a single reflection component producing the majority of the soft x - ray excess and the 4 - 10  kev emission .",
    "the slower variability does not show a clear difference between the _ rms _ and covariance spectra , showing that the source spectrum varies coherently on timescales longer than 10  ks .",
    "this could be interpreted in the spectral decomposition above in terms of propagation of fluctuations from the disc , through the soft x - ray excess region and into the high energy region ( see e.g. arvelo & uttley 2006 ; fabian et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we also assemble a broadband sed for pg 1244 + 026 from far infrared to hard x - ray , showing that this is dominated by the disc emission and that this extends into the soft x - ray bandpass , consistent with the spectral decomposition above .",
    "this system , and other nls1 with similar spectral properties ( e.g. re j1034 + 396 , rx j0136.9 - 3510 ) , can then be used to constrain to the black hole spin via disc continuum fitting , as high black hole spin over - predicts the observed soft x - ray flux ( d13 ) .",
    "this work is mainly based on observations obtained with _ xmm - newton _ , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and nasa .",
    "this work makes use of data from _ sdss _ , whose funding is provided by the alfred p. sloan foundation , the participating institutions , the national science foundation , the u.s .",
    "department of energy , the national aeronautics and space administration , the japanese monbukagakusho , the max planck society , and the higher education funding council for england .",
