    "however , most important are _ dynamic _ self - assembling systems , i.e. , out - of - equilibrium systems that form their characteristic order when dissipating energy  @xcite .",
    "understanding and controlling such systems is required in order to maximize the value of self - assembly as a strategy for synthesis and fabrication and , e.g. , for the understanding of the role of self - assembly in biology .",
    "interacting systems driven on a substracte include , e.g. , colloids  @xcite , charge density waves  @xcite , wigner crystals  @xcite , and vortex matter in superconductors  @xcite .",
    "thus , in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) colloidal crystal driven across ordered substrates , kinks and antikinks were experimentally observed  @xcite . for vortex matter driven on a random substrate ,",
    "various dynamical regimes : pinned , plastic , and elastic flow were revealed in experiments  @xcite and in theory  @xcite . using a periodic substrate , instead of random , results in rich dynamics including negative differential resistivity of either n - type  @xcite or n- and s - type  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , driven vortex matter on quasiperiodic substrates  @xcite revealed electron - like or hole - like `` vortex conductivity ''  @xcite . in the above examples , the interaction between the fundamental units ( i.e. , colloids or vortices ) was purely repulsive with a single length scale .    in case of competing interaction characterizied by two ( or more ) length scales , systems self - organize forming equilibrium , or at least metastable , patterns",
    "the main question is , how the pre - existed static patterns will evolve being driven on a random or regular substrate ? and , will they evolve in some other , dynamically - induced , non - equilibrium patterns which do not exist in equilibrium ?",
    "these are still open important questions for the general case of competing interaction and for an arbitrary potential - energy profile of the substrate .",
    "only a few studies have been performed for some special cases .",
    "for example , the dynamical reordering in the plastic regime  @xcite was examined in a system with competing short and long - range interactions  @xcite .    in the previous studies ,",
    "the interaction at long distance was repulsive , since an attractive interaction leads to phase separation .",
    "however , as shown recently  @xcite , a competing interaction with a repulsive core and a fast decaying attractive tail can induce long - living metastable states .",
    "this model  @xcite is applicable to a number of diverse physical systems with fast decaying interaction , e.g. , atoms and molecules ( lennard - jones ) , colloids and ferrofluids . also , it can model inter - vortex interaction in low-@xmath0  @xcite and multi - band superconductors such as @xmath1 , where inhomogeneous vortex patterns , e.g. , gossamers and stripes , were recently revealed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "those unusual patterns result from a non - monotonic inter - vortex interaction as argued in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent scanning hall probe microscopy measurements  @xcite revealed stripe vortex patterns in @xmath1 which were not due to inhomogeneous pinning but rather suggestive of another source of ordering , e.g. , an external driving bias that might orient the stripes . therefore",
