    "the method of stochastic quantization invented in the end of seventies @xcite has immediately grasped interest of several members of the field - theoretical community , please see @xcite for reviews .",
    "the method has offered a version of the quantum theory in which one has to deal with @xmath1-number fields ( instead of operators or path integrals ) at the expense of introduction of another temporal dimension and langevin forces .",
    "a very considerable amount of work has been applied to develop the theory and run simulations .",
    "in fact , it is the possibility of efficient simulations that has strongly stimulated the research in this method .",
    "initially , it has been worked out as a way to obtain euclidean vacuum expectation values of the ( products of ) quantum fields .",
    "later , it has been demonstrated that the method can also work in the minkowski space - time @xcite .",
    "what is more , it has been shown that the stochastic quantization can also be used to obtain transition amplitudes between quantum states in simple quantum mechanical systems @xcite .    in spite of the initially vigorous development , the interest in stochastic quantization diminished considerably in the nineties .",
    "the present authors believe that this happened because of the following reasons : ( i ) the method has been worked out with the hope to offer efficient simulations of yang - mills fields , especially in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "however , the computational qcd has had in its disposal very efficient unrelated methods , and stochastic quantization has not seemed to offer much more advantage from the computational point of view ; ( ii ) there have been serious difficulties in the simulations in minkowski ( rather than euclidean ) space due to the instabilities caused by the langevin forces ; ( iii ) it appears that the non - perturbative analytic or semi - analytic methods have been somewhat underdeveloped in the stochastic - quantization context - the only works on the subject of which are aware are the variational approaches of @xcite and @xcite and hartree - like technique of @xcite ( the above four papers are virtually forgotten ) ; ( iv ) the method has not been sufficiently tested on simpler quantum systems - for instance , one would expect that before difficult lattice qcd simulations are launched , the stochastic quantization should first demonstrate that it allows to get , say , correct values of the ground - state energy of the helium atom .",
    "the objective of the paper is to address the point ( iii ) and demonstrate that the stochastic quantization can very easily import well - known non - perturbative techniques from the non - linear mechanics as well as the physics of random vibrations . here",
    ", we use the simplest of those methods , namely , that of statistical linearization @xcite , please see also @xcite for reviews .",
    "it allows one to replace a non - linear term in a langevin equation with such a linear term that the expectation value of the resulting error is minimized . however , there exist also several other linearization criteria .",
    "we mention here the minimization of the energy error , equality of mean - square energies , and equality of mean - square system functions ( i.e. the deterministic parts of the right - hand sides of corresponding langevin equations ) .",
    "our analyses provided below may be classified as a specfic version of hartree - like approach .",
    "the equations of motion in the additional time - like variables are linearized and the linear parameters which enter them are found variationally on assuming a gaussian distribution of fields .",
    "since the hartree approaches have been discussed in multitude of papers , there is a natural question whether it is profitable to investigate it again .",
    "the present authors believe that it is indeed the case because the simplest version of statistical linearization presented here is only a necessary first step towards developing more sophisticated and non - trivial approximation schemes based on the so - called higher - order linearization as well as building statistically equivalent non - linear solvable models .",
    "less importantly , we have not found any discussion of a hartree - like approximation in the context of stochastic quantization except of @xcite where it has been introduced , so to say ,  by hand \" rather than with the help of a systematic procedure like the one described below .",
    "the main part of the paper is organized as follows . to introduce the technique of statistical linearization in the stochastic - quantization context",
    ", the quantum anharmonic oscillator in non - zero temperature is considered in section 2 .",
    "temperature - dependent corrections to its frequency are obtained . in section 3 ,",
    "we consider the langevin equations for @xmath0 theory in three spatial dimensions and finite temperature .",
    "we show that the statistical linearization technique provides us with the correct self - consistent equation for the self - energy .",
    "its zeroth - temperature limit is analyzed using the ramanujan summation of divergent series .",
    "section 4 contains an analysis of the bose - hubbard model from the point of view of stochastic quantization .",
    "the langevin equations are again linearized and dyson - schwinger - like equation for the self - energy is obtained .",
    "section 5 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider the anharmonic oscillator described by the following euclidean action ( confer @xcite ) :    @xmath2 d \\tau,\\ ] ]    ito where @xmath3 is the euclidean time , @xmath4 is the position of the oscillator , @xmath5 - its mass , @xmath6 denotes the frequency of the free oscillations , @xmath7 is inverse temperature , and @xmath8 parametrizes the strength of nonlinearity .    according to the prescription of the stochastic quantization",
    ", @xmath4 should satisfy the equation :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 denotes the functional derivative , and @xmath11 is an additional independent variable of the temporal character while @xmath12 is a gaussian langevin  force \" which satisfies the following conditions :    @xmath13    explicitly , the pseudo - dynamics in  time \" @xmath11 is governed by the following non - linear stochastic diffusion equation :    @xmath14    it has been proved @xcite that the euclidean , ground - state correlation functions @xmath15 can be obtained by taking the limit :    @xmath16    where the subscript @xmath17 denotes the averaging over the stochastic forces @xmath17 . taking the limit is equivalent to the averaging by using a stationary solution to the fokker - planck equation corresponding to the langevin equation ( [ aomain ] ) .",
    "we look for the stationary ( @xmath18 ) solution of eq.([aomain ] ) subject to periodic boundary condition in the euclidean time @xmath3 to include finite temperature :    @xmath19    by  stationary `` solution '' of ( [ aomain ] ) we mean the inhomogeneous part of the general solution corresponding to @xmath11 sufficiently large that the initial values of @xmath20 give vanishing contribution as they are exponentially damped .    due to the boundary conditions ,",
    "it is reasonable to expand :    @xmath21    where    @xmath22    the stochastic force can be expanded in the same way :    @xmath23    with @xmath24 .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath25 satisfy :    @xmath26    now , we are in position to look for an equivalent linear system .",
    "it has to take the form :    @xmath27    the statistical linearization technique in its simplest version consists of subtracting the equations ( [ ao2 ] - [ ao3 ] ) , taking the square of the resulting error , summing over all @xmath28 and taking the expectation value .",
    "this expectation value should be computed with respect to the distribution function of @xmath29 obtained by solving the full nonlinear system .",
    "as it is , however , not available , we approximate that expectation value by its value obtained from the linearized system ( [ ao3 ] ) .",
    "thus , we need to minimize the expression :    @xmath30    the absolute value in the above expression appears naturally because @xmath29 are , naturally , complex ; they must satisfy , however , the condition @xmath31 because @xmath4 itself is real .",
    "differentiating with respect to @xmath32 and equating to zero the obtained derivative @xmath33 gives the following implicit equation for @xmath34 :    @xmath35    for gaussian distribution of @xmath36 , the above ratio of moments can be simplified @xcite :    @xmath37    so that @xmath34 depends only on the second moments of @xmath36 :    @xmath38    now , the system ( [ ao3 ] ) can be solved immediately to give for @xmath18 :    @xmath39    let us now write @xmath40 .",
    "then the  self - energy \" @xmath41 satisfies the self - consistent equation :    @xmath42    performing now the frequency summation we find that @xmath41 must satisfy :    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the bose - einstein factor @xmath45 .    in fig . 1",
    "there is a shaded contour plot of the dependence of the @xmath46 on dimensionless coupling constant @xmath47 and dimensionless inverse temperature @xmath48 .    .",
    "let us observe that the dependence of @xmath41 on @xmath49 is non - analytic even for zeroth temperature .",
    "thus , the result is , in a sense , `` non - perturbative '' .",
    "we start with the following euclidean action for the @xmath0 model :    @xmath50    where    @xmath51    the resulting langevin equation for @xmath52 reads    @xmath53    we impose periodic boundary conditions in the euclidean time , @xmath54 .",
    "also , as it is convenient to work with discrete variables , we initially assume that @xmath52 is also periodic in each spatial variable , that is , @xmath52 is defined in the box of the volume @xmath55 with periodic boundary condition imposed in each spatial direction . at the end of calculations",
    "we shall take the limit @xmath56 .",
    "thus , we expand :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath49 , @xmath5 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 are integers .    upon a similar fourier decomposition of the stochastic forces we obtain :    @xmath62    where    @xmath63    the corresponding linear system takes the form :    @xmath64    using the same prescription as before , i.e. , minimization of the expectation value of the error , we find :    @xmath65    on writing    @xmath66    and taking expectation values with respect to the gaussian probability density associated with the linear system , we obtain :    @xmath67    or by taking the limit @xmath56 ,    @xmath68    this is a self - consistent , temperature - dependent equation for the self - energy of the self - interacting non - linear scalar field . it agrees with that derived in @xcite ( please see also @xcite ) .",
    "needless to say , the really serious analysis starts precisely at this point .",
    "it must involve both the mass and coupling constant renormalization , and has been performed , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the separation of the zero - temperature and temperature - dependent terms as well as determination of the thermal mass is surprisingly non - trivial , @xcite . in view of the fact that the matter has been carefully discussed in the above papers",
    ", we shall not give any detailed analysis of our own .",
    "we would only like to investigate briefly the consequences of application to eq .",
    "( [ phi4gap ] ) of the so - called ramanujan technique of summation of divergent series .",
    "but before doing this we would like to observe that , while there is nothing new in eq .",
    "( [ phi4gap ] ) , we have obtained it practically effortlessly using the simplest , and actually trivial , version of statistical linearization of stochastically quantized theory . no diagrammatic analyses or functional differentiation or integration have been necessary .",
    "let us perform the frequency summation as well as the angular integration in eq .",
    "( [ phi4gap ] ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath41 takes now the form :    @xmath69    the integral of the first term on the right - hand side is obviously quadratically divergent .",
    "let us have a closer look at the limit @xmath70 .",
    "the second term ( which contains a convergent integral ) on the right - hand side vanishes in that limit . the self - consistent expression for the self - energy takes then the form :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and we assume that @xmath73 .",
    "euler s substitution @xmath74 yields :    @xmath75    in order to deal with the above divergent integrals let us invoke the abel - plana formula @xcite :    @xmath76    it makes sense if both the integrals and the series converge .",
    "however , let us make use of the following definition .",
    "we say that an integral @xmath77 is summable in the ramanujan sense if the sum of the series @xmath78 in the ramanujan sense @xcite exists , and the integral    @xmath79    converges in the ordinary sense .",
    "then we write :    @xmath80    with obvious meaning of the superscript @xmath81 .",
    "what is called here the  ramanujan summation \" of divergent series consists in the following .",
    "let @xmath82 be a formal ( divergent ) series , and let @xmath83 .",
    "then , if @xmath84 satisfies the difference equation @xmath85 , the value @xmath86 gives the sum of the series @xmath82 .",
    "the sum is unique if we additionally require fulfillment of the condition @xmath87 and @xmath88 does not grow too fast with @xmath60 . in @xcite",
    "an algorithm to compute @xmath84 in terms of the borel transform of @xmath88 as a well as a useful table of the ramanujan sums of some divergent series is given .    with the above definitions in mind",
    ", we can investigate the question of summability of divergent integrals in eq .",
    "( [ diverge ] ) in the ramanujan sense .",
    "we find immediately :    @xmath89    as the last integral is equal to @xmath90 , we have :    @xmath91    but , according to @xcite ,    @xmath92    where @xmath93 are the bernoulli numbers . hence @xmath94 , and    @xmath95    what is more ,    @xmath96    using now the fact that in the ramanujan sense the sum of the harmonic series is the euler - mascheroni constant @xmath97 while    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the digamma function @xcite ( please see the formula 6.3.21 of @xcite ) , we find that , quite trivially ,    @xmath100    because @xmath101 .    as a result of the ramanujan summation , we get in the zeroth - temperature limit :    @xmath102    or    @xmath103    with @xmath104 .",
    "thus the  renormalization \" of the coupling constant appears to be finite ( provided that @xmath105 ) , and the same is true about the correction to the mass .",
    "this is possible only because we have performed a summation of two divergent integrals . in the present case ,",
    "the ramanujan approach resulted in their trivial elimination .",
    "we would like to repeat that the formal manipulation with divergent series in the spirit of ramanujan can not be thought of as a substitution of the detailed and careful renormalization procedure .",
    "nonetheless , the former is perhaps of non - vanishing interest and may be worth of some further study .",
    "let us now consider the one - dimensional bose - hubbard model .",
    "it is of some interest because of the potential application of cold bose gases on lattices as an  analog computer \" to simulate properties of gauge fields .",
    "the bose - hubbard model describes the ( thermo)dynamics of bose particles on a lattice under the assumption that the particles can jump only between neighboring sites , and only the on - site interactions are present .",
    "mathematically , it is defined by the following ( real - time ) action :    @xmath106,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath107 is the so - called hopping parameter , @xmath108 is the interaction strength , and @xmath109 is the chemical potential .",
    "the index @xmath5 enumerates the sites on one - dimensional lattice , and we assume that size of the lattice is @xmath110 .    in the present case , it more convenient to work in real time , and perform the analytic continuation to imaginary time only at the end of calculations .",
    "let us notice that the well - known difficulties in the simulations of the langevin equations in the real time do not concern us here because the whole procedure is analytic ( except of the last step ) .    using the prescription by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we write    @xmath111    the complex amplitudes are , however , to be considered as independent quantities , so that we effectively complexify the theory .",
    "taking the functional derivatives gives us the system :    @xmath112    @xmath113    in the above equations @xmath114 denotes an infinitesimal positive constant introduced to guarantee the existence of stationary solutions .",
    "the stochastic forces satisfy the relation :    @xmath115    we impose upon @xmath116 and @xmath117 periodic boundary conditions in time @xmath118 with the period @xmath119 .",
    "we shall also assume that the whole lattice is periodic , that is @xmath120 for some integer @xmath110 .",
    "this allows us to diagonalize the linear parts of the above equations by expanding :    @xmath121    and analogously for @xmath117 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 .    the complex amplitudes @xmath124 satisfy the relations :    @xmath125 f_{k \\mu }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & - i \\frac{v}{t_{0 }",

    "the equivalent linear systems read :    @xmath129    @xmath130    where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are not complex - conjugated quantities .",
    "minimization of the error leads now to the following self - consistent equation :    @xmath133    or ,    @xmath134    where    @xmath135    we now make the rotation in the complex plane to obtain the results in imaginary time and write simply @xmath136 .",
    "summation over @xmath28 can be easily performed to give the self - energy as a sum over finite number of discrete momenta :    @xmath137    let us notice that the zeroth - temperature limit is not obvious because we do not know the sign of the expression inside the hyperbolic cotangent function . the solutions to the above self - consistent equation for @xmath41",
    "provide us , upon the analytic continuation from matsubara s to the retarded green function , with the temperature - dependent approximation to the self - energy of a particle in the bose - hubbard model .",
    "while the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ bhse ] ) is beyond the scope of the present work , we provide fig .",
    "2 which illustrates the general structure of solutions . in this figure",
    "we have plotted curves representing the function    @xmath138    ( i.e. , the right - hand side of ( [ bhse ] ) ) , where @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 as dependent on @xmath142 , with superimposed straight line @xmath143 .",
    "the points at which that straight line crosses the curves represent solutions of ( [ bhse ] ) .",
    "the parameters chosen to plot fig . 2 have been : @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .    .",
    "it is to be noticed that one of the parameters we used to plot fig .",
    "2 , namely @xmath140 has been taken to be @xmath148 .",
    "such a value is quite realistic .",
    "however , it obviously means that we are in the strong coupling regime , for which the statistical linearization may lead to erroneous results .",
    "thus , the above figures are to be understood merely as an illustration of possible solutions of ( [ bhse ] ) .",
    "there is , unfortunately , no general theory which could determine whether or not the statistical linearization provides valid approximations in the strong coupling regime .    as is clearly seen from eq .",
    "( [ bhse ] ) and from the figures , the gap equation possesses multiple solutions .",
    "a similar situation occcurs in both qcd @xcite and in the superconductivity theory @xcite .",
    "we plan to discuss the important and interesting question of stability of various solutions elsewhere .",
    "in this paper we have applied the statistical linearization technique to the stochastically quantized field equations in euclidean setting .",
    "three examples have been given : the quantum anharmonic oscillator , the real scalar @xmath0 theory , and the bose - hubbard model .",
    "in all three cases a self - consistent non - perturbative expression for the temperature - dependent self - energy has been provided . only the simplest , gaussian , version of the linearization technique have been employed . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the statistical linearization methods are very rich .",
    "at least two ways can be used in order to improve the acuracy of results .",
    "firstly , one can apply the so - called higher - order linearization @xcite . within that approach ,",
    "one replaces non - linear terms in the field equations by a new dependent variable , which satisfies its own ( complicated ) differential equation ; the latter is then linearized by error minimization .",
    "that method is somewhat analogous to , but not identical with , the breaking of the schwinger - dyson ( or , analogously , bbgky ) hierarchy of the integro - differential equations for the correlation functions .",
    "secondly , one can also employ the so - called `` equivalent non - linearization '' @xcite approach in which the original non - linear equations are replaced by simpler ( though still non - linear ) equations with known statistical properties of solutions .",
    "work is in progress on application of both those techniques in the physics of cold gases , quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics ."
