    "broad emission lines in quasars and in other types of active galaxies have lead to the identification of those objects as distant sources with strong non - stellar nuclear emission coming from their nuclei due to accretion onto black holes . both carl seyfert ( 1943 )",
    "@xcite and maarten schmidt ( 1963 ) @xcite in their seminal papers were just studying emission lines . since that time",
    "there was a tremendous progress in our understanding of the nature of active galaxies and in our knowledge of the broad line region ( blr ) properties .",
    "emission line measurements are also nowadays a powerful tool to measure the mass of the central black hole ( kaspi et al .",
    "@xcite ; peterson et al .",
    "@xcite ) and these measurements done for large samples of quasars ( e.g. vestergaard et al .",
    "@xcite ) give the insight into the evolution of galaxies .",
    "but one question still remains to be answered : why this region actually forms there .",
    "the properties of the blr contain a hidden hint .",
    "the argument goes through three independent lines of reasoning .",
    "first point : the lines cover a considerable fraction ( 0.1 - 0.3 ) of an agn sky from the point of view of the nucleus , as estimated from the line luminosity ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time",
    "they are almost never along the line of sight to the nucleus although nal are seen in a significant fraction of objects ( bal are rare ; 20% of normal quasars  @xcite ) and both nal and bal form at larger distances from the nucleus .",
    "there are rare reports of the transient absorption phenomenon seen in x - ray data which are likely to be due to blr clouds  @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that the blr is not spherical but flat and located close to the equatorial plane ; in side - viewed objects this region is hidden from us by the dusty - molecular torus and in top - viewed objects the line of sights does not cross blr .",
    "kinetic arguments also suggest such a flattening ( e.g. nikolajuk  @xcite , collin  @xcite ) .",
    "second point : the line widths are from 1000 to 10 000 km s@xmath2 , consistent with the keplerian disk - like motion .",
    "however , lines rarely show two - component profile expected from a flattened disk - like configuration",
    ". there are rare objects showing clearly double - peaked lines but these are mostly radio - galaxies ( eracleous & halpern  @xcite ) , and some objects hint for the disk - like profiles in the variable part of their line profiles .",
    "the majority of quasars have a single peak .",
    "murray & chiang have shown that even a disk - like configuration can lead to single profiles but it requires special wind velocity profile  @xcite . and",
    "no systematic shift ( outflow velocity signature ) with respect to the narrow line region ( nlr ) is seen in balmer lines .",
    "third point : the careful studies of the luminosity and the line ratios , particularly in respects to the low ionization lines like balmer lines and mg ii ( collin - souffrin  @xcite ) , suggest that additional collisional heating is needed in addition to pure radiative heating estimated from the shape of the continuum emission from the central region of an active galaxy .",
    "all three problems point towards the blr as flat configuration roughly in keplerian motion but with additional turbulence with the turbulence velocities of order of a thousand km s@xmath2 .",
    "such velocities , although only a fraction of the keplerian speed would be 100 times higher than the sound speed , and the development of a such highly supersonic turbulence is not easily explained .    in our paper",
    "we offer the plausible mechanism which gives strict quantitative predictions where the lil part of the blr would form .",
    "future high resolution observations will possibly resolve the blr region and offer direct test of the proposed mechanism .",
    "we determine the effective temperature of the accretion disk atmosphere underlying the blr using the observational determination of the blr radius from the reverberation method and combine it with the shakura - sunyaev theory of accretion disks  @xcite .",
    "the scaling of the blr with luminosity discovered by kaspi et al .",
    "@xcite has been studied by several authors ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "here we use the result of bentz et al .",
    "@xcite , where the starlight contamination was carefully removed .",
    "the power - law index in the scaling between the blr size and the monochromatic luminosity in their analysis is consistent with 0.5 within the errors .",
    "we thus fixed this slope at 0.5 , and refitted their data again , obtaining the relation @xmath3 = 1.538 \\pm 0.027 + 0.5 \\log l_{44,5100 } , \\label{bentz}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] is in light days and @xmath5 is the monochromatic luminosity at 5100    measured in units of @xmath6 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the value 0.027 is the error in the best - fit vertical normalization ; the dispersion around the best fit is larger but still small at 0.21 .",
    "we assume that the disk is not strongly irradiated , and the outflow from the disk is not too strong , so the simple theory of the alpha - disk ( shakura & sunyaev  @xcite ) applies . in this case , the monochromatic flux at 5100    can be calculated from the model , if the black hole mass and the accretion rate are known . taking the numerical formula of tripp et al .",
    "@xcite ( corrected for a factor - of - two error , nikolajuk , private communication ) , we derive @xmath7 where the black hole mass , @xmath8 , and the accretion rate , @xmath9 , are in g and g s@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "this formula allows us to calculate the blr radius from the eq .",
    "[ bentz ] , if the product of ( @xmath10 ) is known .    for completeness",
    ", we introduce a geometrical factor representing the effect of the inclination angle , @xmath11 for the measured delay ( for details , see czerny & hryniewicz  @xcite ) .",
    "this gives the relation between the actual disk radius , @xmath12 , and the measured delay of h@xmath0 line : @xmath13 \\over 1 + \\sin i } \\label{eq : geom}\\ ] ] and we fix this factor adopting the average inclination @xmath14 after lawrence & elvis  @xcite .",
    "the shakura - sunyaev accretion disk theory allows us to calculate the effective temperature of the disk at that radius as a function of the black hole mass and accretion rate @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "since blr is far from the central black hole , the inner boundary effect can be neglected .    when we combine eqs .",
    "[ bentz ] , [ l5100 ] , [ eq : geom ] , and [ teff ] , the dependence on the unknown mass and accretion rate vanishes , and we obtain a single value for all the sources in the sample @xmath17 where the error reflects the error in the constant in eq .  [ bentz ] .",
    "we stress that the resulting value does not depend either on the black hole mass or accretion rate .",
    "the value is universal , for all sources .",
    "this value is interesting since it is close to the critical temperature at which the dust can form .",
    "the distance is smaller than the distance to the dusty torus @xmath18 pc ( nenkova et al .",
    "@xcite ; where @xmath19 stands for the bolometric luminosity in @xmath20 erg s@xmath2 ) since in our case the temperature results only from the local disk dissipation instead of the irradiation by the central parts of agn .    the dependence of the size of the blr in ngc 5548 on the monochromatic luminosity : data points come from bentz et al .",
    "@xcite , and the best fit line has the slope @xmath21 in the logarithmic space , instead of 0.5 characteristic for the statistical sample . ]    the dependence of the size of the blr in ngc 5548 on the monochromatic luminosity : data points come from bentz et al .",
    "@xcite , and the best fit line has the slope @xmath21 in the logarithmic space , instead of 0.5 characteristic for the statistical sample . ]",
    "this uniform effective temperature of 1000 k of the disk underlying the onset of the blr implies that the dust present in the disk atmosphere is responsible for the phenomenon .",
    "the radiation pressure acting on dusty atmosphere is very large , as it is known for example for wolf - rayet stars and the strong wind develops .",
    "however , unlike in stars , the further development of the wind is modified by two factors : gravitational attraction in disk geometry rises with the height and , more importantly , the irradiation by the central parts of the accretion disk ( uv ) also rises very strongly due to better geometrical exposure .",
    "the dust evaporates , the rising material looses the radiation pressure support and falls back onto the disk surface .",
    "such a failed wind can account both for the large additional turbulent velocity without any strong signature of outflow since both outflow and inflow take place with comparable velocities , and for the additional heating , as the outflowing and infalling clumps collide .",
    "this region is separate from the region known as dusty / molecular torus . at large distances the uv irradiation is less important , the dust survives even at large height from the disk and the outflow proceeds forming an appearance of a torus . the schematic representation of the blr formation mechanism is shown in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the mechanism of blr formation proposed in this paper and in czerny & hryniewicz  @xcite is attractive since it is universal for all sources , and the physics of dusty winds is known from stellar evolution .",
    "although the possible presence of the dust in the blr clouds was previously discussed by a number of authors , our idea of the key importance of the dust for blr is new and should be further tested .",
    "the whole idea automatically explains why the size of the blr region scales with the square root of the monochromatic luminosity , with small dispersion , since no dependence on the second parameter - for example bolometric luminosity is expected .",
    "we expect a weak dependence of the inclination angle but this also remains to be tested .      in the paper by czerny & hryniewicz  @xcite we tested additionally the mechanism by determining the disk blr temperature for a number of sources which were carefully monitored for many years ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "@xcite ) and their luminosity was corrected for the starlight contribution at the basis of the hst data ( bentz et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for all sources",
    "we obtain the temperature value close to 1000 k. this is also the case for ngc 5548 monitored for 14 years .",
    "we do not see any correlation between the accretion rate and the disk effective temperature at the onset of blr in the objects for which the reverberation monitoring was performed .",
    "mechanism simply connecting the blr distance with irradiation would likely contain the trend with the bolometric luminosity which ( in shakura - sunyaev model ) rises faster with the accretion rate than the monochromatic luminosity .      in our approach to the description of the disk atmosphere underlying the blr and to the description of the monochromatic flux we used the simple local stationary disk model of shakura & sunyaev .",
    "however , observations of agn show that agn are variable and this variability is a central point of the monitoring approach and the measurement of delays .",
    "it means not only that the disk is not stationary , but it implies that non - local phenomena ( irradiation of the outer disk parts by the inner disk ) are complicated by these time delays .",
    "the measured time delays between the continua measured at ubv bands are typically of order of a day or less in seyfert galaxies ( see e.g. sergeev et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the major trends in optical luminosity are of order of tend - hundreds of days , and measured time delays of h@xmath0 line are of order of days ( see compilation in bentz et al .",
    "both an outer and an inner disk are the sources of variability , as argued for example by gaskell  @xcite , and the perturbations in the outer disk propagate mechanically inwards through the disk ( sound waves , viscous propagation ) while perturbations in the inner disk affects the outer disk through irradiation , and the timescale is the light travel time",
    ". this complex situation can be roughly represented with two different accretion rates / luminosities : inner accretion rate visible through the monochromatic flux and responsible for the current strength of irradiation and the outer accretion rate ( past value , likely closer to the average value ) characteristic for the disk structure underlying the blr .",
    "we can now consider various possibilities depending on the importance of the irradiation on the measured value .",
    "if the whole idea of czerny & hryniewicz  @xcite is incorrect , and the dust formation in the accretion disk atmosphere has nothing to do with the formation of the blr , then we return to the classical point of view that the onset of blr requires a specific value of the ionization parameter . in this case",
    "the radius of the blr should scale with the accretion rate at the inner disk as @xmath22 if we assume that the monochromatic flux is nevertheless dominated by the local dissipation , i.e. we can use eq .",
    "[ l5100 ] , the final dependence between the monochromatic luminosity and the blr radius will be @xmath23 i.e. the slope will be close to the older value and the presence of the additional dependence on the black hole mass would be expected . for a given source , only the dependence on the monochromatic luminosity matters , while in a sample of sources there is a likely bias towards positive correlation between the monochromatic luminosity and the mass , leading to much more shallow dependence .    therefore , we additionally plotted the results of the monitoring for ngc 5548 , taking the data points from bentz et al .",
    "where the starlight was subtracted .",
    "the relation is shown in fig .",
    "the slope is indeed steeper , equal to @xmath24 .",
    "the lower limit is consistent within the error with the expectations based on the ionization parameter , but the value itself is surprisingly high .",
    "therefore , we considered whether the dust based scenario can explain such a steep slope .",
    "if we follow the general idea of czerny & hryniewicz  @xcite of dust onset of the blr but we include the irradiation of the disk surface we also obtain the dependence of the blr position on the accretion rate at the inner disk . assuming that the irradiation actually dominates we have @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the disk thickness , and the radial dependence is in the form of a power law , @xmath27 .",
    "loska et al .",
    "@xcite considered direct and indirect irradiation of an agn accretion disk and calculated the disk thickness of the non - irradiated and irradiated disk taking into account the vertical disk structure with convection and realistic opacities , with atomic transitions , molecules and dust .",
    "the disk thickness rises slowly with the radius at the inner part of the disk and then flares at larger distances , roughly as predicted by the original shakura & sunyaev model . the final rise in loska et al .",
    "@xcite is roughly with @xmath28 ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) . if we supplement this value of @xmath29 into eq .",
    "[ eq : irrad ] , assume the blr location at a fixed temperature determined by the dust , and combine it with the expression for the monochromatic flux we obtain the expected scaling @xmath30 i.e. the trend with the black hole mass appears but the trend with the luminosity matches nicely the one seen for ngc 5548 .    instead",
    ", if the irradiation dominates at 5100     the spectrum has much flatter slope ( @xmath31 ) than in the shakura - sunyaev disk ( @xmath32 ) , and the monochromatic flux is proportional to the accretion rate , @xmath33 . in this case the combination of the irradiation dominating 5100     and the assumption of the specific value of the ionization parameter specified blr gives the required relation for the statistical sample @xmath34 but it is inconsistent with the trends observed in ngc 5548 .",
