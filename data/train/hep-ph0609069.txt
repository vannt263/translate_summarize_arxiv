    "with the advent of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , 80 million top quark pairs will be produced per year @xcite .",
    "this number will increase by one order of magnitude with the high luminosity option .",
    "therefore , the properties of top quarks can be examined with significant precision at lhc .",
    "thus top quark physics will be a testing ground for new phenomena , be it electroweak symmetry breaking , or the existence of interactions forbidden in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) in general , and of the top quark in particular , play an important role for validation of the sm and for new physics ( np ) signals . in the sm ,",
    "there are no fcnc mediated by the @xmath10 or @xmath11-boson at tree level , and fcnc induced by radiative effects are highly suppressed @xcite .",
    "higher order contributions are proportional to @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the masses of the quarks in the loop diagrams and @xmath14 the @xmath15-boson mass . thus all top - quark induced fcnc in sm are highly suppressed .",
    "their branching ratios predicted in the sm are of the order of @xmath16 to @xmath17 @xcite , far away from present and even future reaches of either the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite or the international linear collider ( ilc ) @xcite .",
    "there are many models of np in which the branching ratios for the two - body fcnc decays are much larger than those obtained in the sm , and rare top decays might be enhanced to reach detectable levels @xcite .",
    "rare fcnc two - body processes @xmath18 have been extensively studied in the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm)@xcite , alternative left - right symmetric models @xcite , constrained @xcite and unconstrained @xcite minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , left - right supersymmetric models @xcite , supersymmetric model with r - parity violation @xcite , top - assisted technicolor models @xcite as well as models with extra singlet quarks @xcite .",
    "in addition to the two - body rare decays of top quark , some of its rare three - body decays e.g. , @xmath19 have been considered in the literature within the sm @xcite and for np @xcite .",
    "these three body decays are suppressed with respect to two - body decays in the sm but some of them get comparably larger within models of np , such as two - higgs - doublet @xcite , especially after including finite - width effects @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that the branching ratio for three - body decay @xmath20 can exceed that of the two body decay @xmath21 in both sm @xcite and mssm @xcite . the three body decay @xmath22 has also been analyzed @xcite , and while the branching ratio is smaller than that of @xmath20 , it is competitive with @xmath23 .",
    "the above facts strengthens the case for investigating top quark physics further in three body decays .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to analyze another three - body rare decay , namely @xmath24 in several frameworks and compare it to both @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this decay was previously analyzed in @xcite in the framework of topcolor assisted technicolor models , and in @xcite as induced by scalar leptoquarks in a pati - salam model .",
    "for b quarks , it is known that under certain circumstances , @xmath27 can be more significant than @xmath28 in restricting the parameter space , i.e. , in supersymmetry in the large @xmath29 region @xcite .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the calculation of @xmath30 in the sm and in section iii we present the same decay in the two higgs doublet model .",
    "section iv is dedicated to presenting the formalism and calculation of @xmath30 in the mssm ( in both constrained and unconstrained versions ) . in each section",
    ", we present the feynman diagrams and analyze the results obtained within the given model .",
    "we include , for completeness , the related decay @xmath31 in section v. finally , we analyze the related production of the single top quark in @xmath32 at the ilc in section vi .",
    "we conclude and discuss experimental observation in section vii .",
    "in the sm , since fcnc are forbidden , the decay @xmath34 is induced at one - loop level through charged currents , involving vertices for @xmath35 in the loop .",
    "the feynman diagrams for this process are depicted in fig .",

    "the sm signal can not be detected in current or future high energy collider experiments ; thus any signal would be an indication of new physics .",
    "the two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) are simple extensions of the sm , formed by adding an extra complex @xmath41 scalar doublet to the sm lagrangian .",
    "motivations for such a extension include the possibility of having cp  violation in the higgs sector , and the fact that some models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking yield the 2hdm as their low - energy effective theory @xcite .",
    "there are three popular versions of this model in the literature , depending on how the two doublets couple to the fermion sector .",
    "models i and ii ( 2hdm - i , 2hdm - ii ) include natural flavor conservation @xcite , while model iii ( 2hdm - iii ) has the simplest extended higgs sector that naturally introduces fcnc at the tree level @xcite .    the most general 2hdm scalar potential which is both @xmath41 and cp invariant is given by @xcite : @xmath42 &   & \\lambda_{4}(|\\phi_{1}|^2 |\\phi_{2}|^2 - |\\phi_{1}^+\\phi_{2}|^2   ) + \\lambda_{5 } ( \\re(\\phi^+_{1}\\phi_{2 } ) -v_{1}v_{2})^2 + \\lambda_{6 } [ \\im(\\phi^+_{1}\\phi_{2})]^2\\ , , \\label{higgspot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "the parameter space of the models are severely constrained by the perturbativity constraints ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the situation becomes even more severe if one takes into account the unitarity bounds .",
    "the branching ratios for @xmath34 obtained running the 2hdm parameters over their allowed values are all negligibly small ( same order as the sm and often numerically indistinguishible ) , and thus not likely to show up at the present or future colliders .",
    "there are few points in the parameter space where @xmath34 becomes enhanced ( around 1 - 2 orders of magnitude ) with respect to the sm predictions but this usually requires very small @xmath65 values ( @xmath66 ) which are excluded @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to get some deviation from the sm values if the higgs bosons ( @xmath67 and @xmath55 ) are very light ( around 100 - 200 gev ) .",

    "in addition to the cross section , we calculated the forward - backward asymmetry and found large asymmetries in certain parts of the parameter space ( it can become @xmath285 ) so that such a measurement would be a better alternative to measuring cross sections for observing this channel .",
