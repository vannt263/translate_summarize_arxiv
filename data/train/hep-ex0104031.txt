    "the hera collider provides the h1 and zeus detectors with electrons or positrons at an energy of @xmath1 and protons with @xmath2 making it a unique place to study the proton structure and to search for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "each experiment has collected up to now more than @xmath3 the largest fraction stems from positron proton collisions .    in this article , processes with large momentum transfer between the incoming lepton and the proton are described . in the next section , the inclusive cross section and the comparison to the standard model is presented .",
    "possible extensions of the standard model are compared to the data subsequently .",
    "the beam particles can interact via neutral or charged current events . in the former , a photon or a @xmath4 boson",
    "is exchanged , @xmath5 in deep - inelastic scattering events , the four - momentum transfered squared @xmath6 is large , i.e.  the exchanged boson is highly virtual . the proton structure is resolved and only a fraction @xmath7 of the proton momentum takes part in the scattering . the double differential cross section can be described by @xmath8\\ ] ] with @xmath9 where the plus and minus signs apply for an incoming electron respectively positron beam .",
    "there is a strong global dependence on @xmath10 such that processes at high momentum transfer are strongly suppressed . the main contribution for virtualities well below",
    "the @xmath4 pole comes from the proton structure function @xmath11 an additional function @xmath12 arises from parity breaking weak interactions which enter through the @xmath4 exchange and the @xmath13 interference .",
    "the last term describes the longitudinal cross section which is a negligible contribution at high @xmath14 and small @xmath15    in charged current processes a @xmath16 boson with the charge of the incoming lepton is exchanged , @xmath17    the double differential cross section is  in leading order  given by @xmath18\\ ] ] with the @xmath19 mass @xmath20 the fermi constant @xmath21 and the quark densities . at low @xmath14 the charged current process",
    "is strongly suppressed compared to the neutral current processes by the mass term .",
    "this is also seen in figure  [ fig : ep ] where the single differential neutral and charged current cross sections are plotted .",
    "it can be seen that the data of both experiments agree well with each other and with the prediction of the standard model over more than six orders of magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : nc ] shows the comparison of the neutral current cross section for both charges of the incoming lepton . while the positron proton data taken in the years 1994 till 1997 have been measured at a center of mass energy of @xmath22 the cms energy for the other data was @xmath23 the data from the lower energy running",
    "has been corrected to allow a direct comparison to that from the higher energy running .    at low photon virtualities ,",
    "the cross sections are similar , while at higher @xmath14 the electron cross section is significantly higher than the one for positions .",
    "the difference is induced by the @xmath4 exchange which does not have a visible influence at low @xmath24 this is seen more clearly in figure  [ fig : zinflu ] where the single inclusive cross section is displayed in two different regions of the momentum transfer . in the high @xmath14 region ( bottom plots ) a significant difference between the theory predictions with and without @xmath4 exchange is found .",
    "the sign of the @xmath13 interference differs for electron and positron induced processes and the data are described well in both cases .",
    "this difference allows the extraction of the structure function @xmath12 from hera data alone as is shown in figure  [ fig : f3 ] .",
    "the data are  within the still large statistical errors  consistent with those of the global fits of the cteq and mrs groups .",
    "the contribution of the longitudinal cross section in this region of phase space at large @xmath14 and high @xmath7 is found to be negligible .",
    "detailed comparisons of data to qcd theory have been performed .",
    "a summary of the results can be found in the talk by j.  engelen in these proceedings@xcite .",
    "one typical signature for physics beyond the standard model are mass resonances in the cross section .",
    "the center of mass energy squared available in the lepton quark cross section is @xmath25 with the @xmath0 center of mass energy @xmath23    figure  [ fig : doubleincl ] shows the inclusive cross section in different bins of @xmath26 the data are well described by a next - to - leading order qcd fit . in figure",
    "[ fig : leptoquark ] , a more detailed study by the h1 collaboration is presented with cuts optimized to look for resonances in the lepton quark cross section .",
    "while in the early data set a deviation from the standard model expectation was seen , the new data set with increased statistics does not confirm this effect .",
    "the zeus collaboration also observes , at high @xmath14 and @xmath27 no significant deviation from the standard model expectations in their analysis of 1994 - 2000 data@xcite .",
    "the h1 collaboration has observed an excess in events containing isolated leptons .",
    "a typical event is shown in figure  [ fig : isolated ] .",
    "the signature of the events consists of an isolated electron or muon , a significant amount of missing transverse energy and a jet with large transverse momentum ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "if the missing momentum is attributed to a single neutrino leaving the detector undetected , the transverse mass of the lepton neutrino pair can be extracted and is found to cluster at the mass of the @xmath19 boson , see figure  [ fig : masspt ] . however , contrary to the distributions of the measured events , the transverse momentum of the jet produced in standard model @xmath19 production is predicted to be small .",
    "this is plotted in figures  [ fig : masspt ] and [ fig : pt ] .",
    "while the h1 collaboration observes an excess at high transverse momenta of the jets , the zeus collaboration finds good agreement with the standard model expectations .",
    "this picture is confirmed by the numbers given in table  [ tab : lepton ] .",
    "an analysis with comparable cuts shows that , even though the monte carlo expectation is very similar , the h1 collaboration sees more events than zeus .",

    "excess has been found , limits have been derived for the photon coupling . since @xmath4 exchange is strongly suppressed , no limits on the @xmath4 coupling are calculated .",
    "the comparison in figure  [ fig : top ] shows that the limits on the photon coupling are the best limits available .",
    "super symmetric extensions of the standard model predict the existence of new particles : squarks , the super symmetric partners of the quarks , and sleptons .",
    "standard model particles have an r parity of + 1 while susy sparticles have -1 . in r parity conserving theories , sparticles can only be produced together with their anti - sparticles . in r parity violating theories , sparticles can be produced e.g.  at lepton quark vertices where the hera @xmath0 collider has a unique detection potential .",
    "many decay channels for sparticles have been looked at . as an example",
    ", the transverse momentum distribution of the jets in the neutrino plus multiple jet channel is shown in figure  [ fig : susypt ] .",
    "the distributions for all channels are well described by the standard model and no excess is found .",
    "therefore , limits on r parity violating couplings have been extracted , see figures  [ fig : susyzeus ] and [ fig : susyh1 ] .",
    "the limits are found to depend only weakly on the susy parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 and are the best limits available .",
    "additional studies have been performed and limits on e.g.  minimal super - gravity theories@xcite , contact interactions , extra dimensions@xcite , or excited fermions@xcite have been extracted .",
    "the collider experiments at the hera storage ring have collected a large amount of @xmath0 data in the last eight years .",
    "studies of the proton structure at the h1 and zeus collaborations have shown a remarkable agreement with the standard model .",
    "the neutral current as well as the charged current inclusive cross section allow the extraction of the proton structure and tests of qcd predictions .",
    "the influence of weak contributions is clearly seen .",
    "the hera @xmath0 collider , also , provides a unique testing ground for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "no signal was found in searches for leptoquarks , for single top production , and for r parity violating susy .",
    "corresponding limits have been extracted and are in large regions of the parameter space the best limits available .",
    "the h1 collaboration has seen an excess of events with an isolated lepton , large missing momentum , and a jet with large @xmath41 this excess is not confirmed by the zeus collaboration .",
    "whether these events are the first signals of physics beyond the standard model or a simple statistical fluctuation can only be decided after more data has been collected .",
    "the next data taking period will begin after a significant upgrade of both , detectors and the storage ring , and startup is expected for the middle of next year .",
