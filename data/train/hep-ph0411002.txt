    "observation of solar neutrinos over the past 35 years by seven experiments has offered a unique opportunity to probe particle physics beyond the standard model of electroweak and strong interactions and physics of the stellar models .",
    "radiochemical experiments have measured the combined flux of a number of different neutrino sources  @xcite .",
    "the only solar neutrinos targeted by a real time measurement thus far have been the @xmath2b neutrinos above a detection threshold of about 5  mev  @xcite .",
    "plans are in place to measure the sub - mev neutrino spectrum with organic liquid scintillator - based detectors , focusing on the presumably abundant @xmath3be neutrinos , with borexino  @xcite , kamland  @xcite , and a possible detector at snolab  @xcite .",
    "such detectors also have the potential to probe the intermediate energy region , searching for the less abundant pep and cno neutrinos .",
    "the possibility of detecting pep neutrinos in organic liquid scintillator based detectors is particularly intriguing .",
    "it was recently pointed out  @xcite that a measurement of the flux of pep solar neutrinos would yield essentially equivalent information about neutrino oscillation parameters and the other solar neutrino fluxes as a measurement of pp solar neutrinos at a comparable level of experimental uncertainty . moreover , given the low theoretical uncertainty on the pep solar neutrinos flux , its measurement could allow investigating the matter - vacuum transition region for solar neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "we recall that a matter - vacuum transition of solar neutrino oscillation is expected in the region between 2 and 3  mev for the msw - lma solution of the solar neutrino problem , and its observation would provide a further stringent test of the msw - lma solution . due to this transition ,",
    "the survival probability - i.e. the probability that electron neutrinos emitted by the sun have not oscillated into other neutrino species when they arrive on earth - for pep neutrinos is about a factor of two larger than the one measured at higher energy by the sno experiment for @xmath2b neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the interaction rates for pep and cno solar neutrinos in organic scintillator predicted by the bp04 version of the standard solar model by bahcall and pinsonneault  @xcite , in the currently preferred msw - lma solution for the solar neutrino problem  @xcite , are 2.1 and 6.6 events per day in 100 metric tons of liquid scintillator respectively .",
    "when data recently released by the luna collaboration for the @xmath4n + p fusion cross section  @xcite are taken into consideration , the signal rate from cno neutrinos is significantly decreased to an expected 3.5 events per day in 100 tons .",
    "the pep neutrino energy spectrum is distinctive , with a single 1.44  mev monochromatic line .",
    "the energy spectrum for electrons scattered in @xmath5-e interactions presents a characteristic compton - like edge at 1.22  mev .",
    "figure  [ f : spectrum ] shows the expected ( msw - lma ) spectrum of scattered electrons from different neutrino sources in the energy range of interest for this study",
    ". we will focus our attention on the detection and measurement of the pep neutrino line . for this purpose",
    "we will set an observation window for the recoil electron between 0.8 and 1.3  mev : for sake of simplicity , all event rates cited in the following will refer to this energy window , unless otherwise noted .",
    "the expected signal rate s in said window for pep and cno neutrinos combined is 2.0 events per day in 100 tons ( 1.5 events per day per 100 tons when using the most recent results from luna ) .",
    "energy spectrum of electrons scattered by pep ( dotted line ) and cno neutrinos ( dash - dotted line ) , for the msw - lma solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the total spectrum for all solar neutrinos ( including pp , @xmath3be , and @xmath2b neutrinos , not shown separately ) is also shown ( continuous line ) .",
    "neutrino fluxes for the spectra shown are from the bp04 version of the standard solar model ( see reference  @xcite ) . the background signal expected from cosmogenic @xmath0c at gran sasso depth",
    "is superimposed ( dashed line ) .",
    "for all the neutrino and the @xmath0c spectra , we assume that the energy resolution of the detector is 5% at 1  mev and varies with the energy e as @xmath6.,width=326 ]    there are three fundamental prerequisites for a succesful measurement of the pep and cno solar neutrinos in an organic liquid scintillator detector .",
    "first , the internal background from long - lived radioactive sources must be carefully controlled .",
    "a @xmath7u and @xmath8th contamination at the 10@xmath9 g / g level , coupled with a @xmath10k contamination of 10@xmath11 g / g would produce 0.6 background events per day in 100 tons in the observation window  @xcite ; this is below the event rate expected for pep neutrinos .",
    "contamination from long - lived radon daughters out of secular equilibrium with @xmath7u ( in particular from @xmath12bi ) must also be reduced below one count per day in the window of interest  @xcite .",
    "a second prerequisite is a low external gamma - ray background from the construction materials of the detector and from the surrounding rocks .",
    "the general strategy to solve the problem is to use pure buffer materials to screen environmental radioactivity present in underground laboratories  @xcite and extremely low radioactivity construction materials  @xcite .",
    "the typical spherical geometry of liquid scintillator based detectors has a peculiar effect on the spectrum of gamma - induced events reconstructed within a given radius : the spectrum gets harder at smaller radii .",
    "therefore , in the innermost part of the detector the @xmath13 ray - induced background in the pep window [ 0.8 - 1.3  mev ] is larger than the corresponding background in the @xmath3be window [ 0.25 - 0.8  mev ]",
    ". this potential problem may be counterbalanced by redefining the fiducial mass for the observation of pep and cno neutrinos . for reference , in the 100  tons fiducial",
    "mass of borexino for @xmath3be neutrinos detection the external background in the [ 0.8 - 1.3  mev ] window is expected at 1  event / day  @xcite , compared with a neutrino signal of 2  events / day .",
    "reducing the mass to 70  tons would lower the background by a factor 10  @xcite while losing only 30% of the signal .",
    "the third fundamental condition for the observation of pep and cno neutrinos is a low internal cosmogenic background production .",
    "this topic is the main subject of this paper .",
    "section  [ s : background ] is an introduction to the problem of @xmath0c cosmogenic background in liquid scintillator detectors .",
    "section  [ s : rates ] describes the production channels for cosmogenic @xmath0c and the results of our calculations for the expected production rate in a 100 tons liquid scintillator target .",
    "section  [ s : comparison ] offers a comparison of our estimate with another estimates available in the literature for the production of @xmath0c by direct interaction of a muon with a @xmath1c nucleus through virtual photons .",
    "finally , section  [ s : reduction ] proposes a veto mechanism for @xmath0c production events , based on the double coincidence with the parent muon and a neutron produced in the reaction .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "cosmogenic radioactive nuclides are produced in deep underground detectors in reactions triggered by the residual muon flux .",
    "as originally pointed out in  @xcite , the fundamental scale of the process is given by the neutron production rate : neutrons are an important and ubiquitous by - product of cosmic ray - induced nuclear reactions .",
    "a comprehensive review of the experimental results on neutron production in underground laboratories can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the first measurement at gran sasso ( depth of 3800 meters of water equivalent , muon flux of 1.2 m@xmath14 hr@xmath15 , average muon energy 320 gev  @xcite ) was performed with the ctf detector  @xcite in 1995 yielding @xmath16 ( neutrons per meter of @xmath17 track ) in scintillator with a density of 0.88 g/@xmath18  @xcite .",
    "a later measurement by the lvd experiment gave @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the figure from the ctf experiment translates into a neutron capture rate of 40 events per day in 100 tons of scintillator .",
    "deutsch suggested  @xcite that the underground production rate for all of the most significant cosmogenic nuclides out of a target mass composed of @xmath1c and @xmath20h could be estimated from the neutron production rate alone .",
    "the list includes @xmath2li , @xmath21li , @xmath0be , @xmath2b , @xmath1b , and @xmath21c , all with mean lives below one minute and easily taggable with the parent muon .",
    "@xmath22be is the cosmogenic radionuclide with the longest mean life , 77 days .",
    "@xmath0c also poses problems , given its 30  minutes mean life which does not allow identifying its decays by tagging them with the parent muon alone .",
    "deutsch hypothized that @xmath0c would be one of the most likely cosmogenic nuclides by - products of muon - induced cascades , and estimated that @xmath0c would account for 5% of the total neutron production rate .",
    "this would correspond to 2 events per day in the 100 fiducial tons of borexino .",
    "the inclusive cross section for the production of several cosmogenic nuclides in muon - induced cascades was measured by a target experiment on a muon beam at cern  @xcite .",
    "the experiment used a liquid scintillator target .",
    "the muon showers were built up in 240  cm of concrete and 200  cm of water used as absorbers and placed in front of the @xmath1c targets .",
    "the use of two positively charged muon ( @xmath23 ) beams of 100 and 190  gev allowed to extract information about the energy dependence of the inclusive cross sections .",
    "the results in  @xcite have shown that @xmath22be is not among the most likely products of cosmic ray - induced reactions : its production rate at gran sasso depth is expected to be less than 0.1 events per day in 100 tons  @xcite . a precise measurement of the inclusive @xmath0c production rate was also made available . at the mean energy of muons at gran sasso , the production rate is 15 events per day in 100 tons  @xcite or , equivalently , @xmath24 .",
    "the rate is different for other locations due to the different muon rates and muon average energies .",

    "@xmath0c is a positron emitter with a 0.96  mev end point ; approximately 35% of its decays produce an event in the pep window [ 0.8 - 1.3  mev ] .",
    "the raw background rate ( b@xmath25 ) from @xmath0c in the pep window varies with the depth of the location of the experiments .",
    "values for the raw background for borexino , kamland , and at snolab are also reported in table  [ t : c11-extr ] .",
    "the background at snolab is sufficiently low to enable pep and cno neutrinos observation without need of any cuts on @xmath0c .",
    "deutsch pointed out that the only way to create @xmath0c is to knock a neutron off the @xmath1c nucleus and suggested to look for a neutron in the final stated of the reaction , emphasizing the possibility of a three - fold coincidence with the parent muon track and the neutron capture on protons in the scintillator to tag the @xmath0c events on a one - by - one basis  @xcite . on the other hand , as suggested by calaprice , there is also the possibility of creating a @xmath0c while ejecting a deuteron in a ( p , d ) exchange reaction .",
    "the ( p , d ) reaction would create an invisible channel for @xmath0c production since the nuclide produced through such process can not be tagged with the three - fold coincidence mentioned above .",
    "similarly , reactions triggered by @xmath26 mesons can also produce decays in invisible channels , as explained later .",

    "electrons are not as effective as @xmath13-rays because their cross section is lower by a factor @xmath53 . other hadronic channels with a neutron in the final state and the muon - induced photodisintegration , also carrying a neutron , account for an additional 35% of the total production rate .",
    "the rate of @xmath0c production in the two invisible channels , corresponding to the ( p , d ) and the ( @xmath35,@xmath36+p ) exhange reactions , accounts for only about 5% of the total production rate .",
    "deutsch s idea of eliminating the @xmath0c events by looking at the three - fold coincidence turns out to be still valid even in presence of invisible channels : only 1 out of 20  @xmath0c nuclides is produced without a neutron in the final state . in section",

    "they estimated a production rate of @xmath0c of 15  events per day in 100 tons of carbon at the kamland depth , or , scaling with the muon flux quoted in table  [ t : muons ] , about @xmath54 track in organic liquid scintillators .",
    "their result is to be compared with our estimate for the same channel reported in table  [ t : prod - rates ] , which amounts to @xmath55 .",
    "the estimate of oconnell and schima is about 2.5  times higher than our estimate .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy lies in the value chosen for @xmath44 , the inverse energy weighted moment of the photodisintegration cross section .",
    "the value of @xmath44 quoted in  @xcite is 4.5  mb , while the value we calculated from the cross sections in use in this paper is 1.74  mb .",
    "it is worth noting that work cited as the source for the photoneutron cross sections in the paper of oconnell and schima , the _ atlas of photoneutron cross sections obtained with monoenergetic photons _",
    "@xcite , offers two values for @xmath44 extrapolated from three different experiments , whose average is 1.65  mb .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with our calculation and is about a factor  2.5 lower than the value quoted in  @xcite .",
    "as shown in the previous section , at least one neutron is produced in association with 95% of the @xmath0c nuclides .",
    "this fraction of the @xmath0c background can be lowered with the muon+neutron tagging .",
    "the remaining 5% can not be reduced with this technique .    in order to suppress the @xmath0c background",
    ", one needs to identify the position and time of each neutron created by a muon - induced shower and then captured on protons in the scintillator .",
    "neutron capture on protons results in the emission of a distinctive 2.2  mev @xmath13-ray . in hydrocarbons ,",
    "neutrons can also be captured on @xmath1c resulting in @xmath13-rays of combined energy 4.9  mev  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for the capture on @xmath1c is @xmath521%  @xcite of the cross section for capture on protons . once the neutron capture time and position",
    "are known , one needs to apply a cut in space and time around every capture point .",
    "the events within a time t from the double muon+neutron coincidence and inside a sphere of radius r from the neutron capture point are rejected .",
    "this technique , originally suggested in  @xcite , has recently been succesfully applied in the 4-ton prototype counting test facility of borexino  @xcite .",
    "the length of time t for which events are rejected should be set to a few times the mean life of @xmath0c .",
    "note that the information carried by the neutron capture does not tell us about the position of the @xmath0c birthplace .",
    "therefore , it is important to set the radius r of the spherical cut to a few times the average neutron range ( note : the spatial resolution of organic liquid scintillator detectors is about 10  cm  @xcite for the 2.2  mev @xmath13-rays from neutron capture and can be neglected with respect to the average neutron range ) . for this reason , we calculated with monte carlo methods the energy distribution of the neutrons produced in association with @xmath0c nuclides for borexino , kamland and at snolab .",
    "the calculation was performed using the relative weights of the @xmath0c production in the different channels as determined for muons of 320 gev .",
    "the procedure is correct for all the three locations since the relative weights @xmath0c production in the different channels at 285 and 350 gev are within 3% of the values at 320 gev ( see table  [ t : prod - rates ] ) .",
    "we used the resulting distribution , shown in figure  [ f : neutrons_energy ] , to source neutrons into fluka , calculating the distribution of the range of neutrons produced in association with @xmath0c , shown in figure  [ f : neutrons_range ] .",
    "energy distribution for neutrons produced in association with @xmath0c nuclides.,width=326 ]     range of neutrons produced in association with @xmath0c nuclides.,width=326 ]    the average energy of neutrons produced in association with @xmath0c is much lower than the average energy of all neutrons produced in muon - induced showers : this is due to the dominant production mechanism being the photoneutron reaction at the giant dipole resonance of @xmath1c at 23  mev . correspondingly , the average range of neutrons associated with @xmath0c production is also much lower than the average range of all the neutrons produced in the shower .",
    "in our calculation we assumed that the @xmath0c nuclides displacement between the point where it is created and the point where it decays is negligible with respect to the range of neutrons created in association with @xmath0c nuclide .",
    "for that to happen , the convective motion of the scintillator has to be sufficiently slow .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by maintaining a small temperature gradient pointing upward everywhere in the detector .",
    "the average range of neutrons created in association with @xmath0c nuclides , whose distribution is shown in figure  [ f : neutrons_range ] , is 44  cm .",
    "kamland data  @xcite show that the measured average displacement of the diffusive @xmath56rn over its 5.5  days mean life is less than 1  meter .",
    "therefore the assumption that the @xmath0c nuclides displacement over their 30  minutes mean life can be kept small with respect to the neutrons range seems fully justified .    due to the presence of the ( n,2n ) exchange reaction that yields two neutrons in the final state , an average of 1.14 neutrons",
    "are created in interactions producing @xmath0c nuclides .",
    "those neutrons , if sufficiently energetic , can also trigger nuclear reactions knocking off other neutrons : our calculation indicates that an average number of about 1.2 neutrons are captured in the scintillator for each neutron produced in a @xmath0c - forming reaction .",
    "the efficiency @xmath57 of rejecting @xmath0c events tagged with the muon+neutron coincidence is equal to the combined efficiencies for the cut in space , @xmath58(r ) , and in time , @xmath59(t ) :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the efficiency for the rejection of @xmath0c events when a cut in time for a time span equal to t is applied around the neutron capture point .",
    "given the expected decay distribution of @xmath0c , we obtain :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the mean life of @xmath0c , 30 minutes .    in equation",
    "[ e : eff ] , @xmath64 is the rejection efficiency for @xmath0c when a cut in space is applied around the neutron capture point , corresponding to a sphere of radius r centered around the capture point position .",
    "given the distribution n(s ) for the range of neutrons shown in figure  [ f : neutrons_range ] , the efficiency for the rejection is equal to : @xmath65    in order to quantify the effectiveness of the background reduction technique we introduce a figure of merit r , independent from the experiments and their locations .",
    "r  is defined as the ratio of the pep+cno neutrino signal rate ( s ) to the residual background rate ( b ) from @xmath0c after suppression of all @xmath0c events identified through the the muon+neutron coincidence ( both s and b are computed in the pep energy window [ 0.8 - 1.3  mev ] ) .",
    "note that the figure of merit r accounts only for the remaining background from @xmath0c , but other possible and independent sources of background are neglected in its definition .",
    "the general expression for r is :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the fraction of @xmath0c production rate in invisible channels ; s ( signal rate ) was discussed in section  [ s : introduction ] and b@xmath25 ( raw @xmath0c background rate , experiment- and location - dependent ) was discussed in section  [ s : rates ] and in table  [ t : c11-extr ] .",
    "formul  [ e : eff ] and  [ e : merit ] show that there is a one - to - one correspondance between the figure of merit r and the combined rejection efficiency @xmath57 .",
    "using equation  [ e : merit ] , the signal rate reported in section  [ s : introduction ] , and background rates from table  [ t : c11-extr ] , we estimate that the optimal signal to background ratio achievable in borexino ( kamland ) is 8 ( 1 ) in case all of the @xmath0c associated with a neutron are successfully tagged .",
    "the optimal limit can not however be reached due to dead mass - time limitations , as shown below .",
    "we define the dead mass - time fraction d as the fraction of ( mass @xmath68 time ) data taking lost to the space and time cuts around a neutron capture event . treating @xmath59 and @xmath58 as independent variables , t and r can be derived by inverting equations  [ e : eta ] and  [ e : zeta ] and become functions of @xmath59 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "we can then compute the dead mass - time fraction d corresponding to the chosen values of the cuts @xmath58 and @xmath59 as :    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the scintillator density , and n is the neutron rate per unit mass in the detector . the expected neutron rates for the experiments taken into consideration are summarized in table  [ t : muons ] .",
    "correlation between the signal to reduced background ratio ( r ) and the dead mass - time fraction for borexino , as a function of spatial ( @xmath58 ) and time ( @xmath59 ) efficiencies of @xmath0c events rejection .",
    "the only background considered in the pep energy window [ 0.8 - 1.3  mev ] is the @xmath0c background surviving the cuts described in the text .",
    "isocontours for the ratio r ( for values @xmath71 ) and for the dead mass - time fraction d ( for values @xmath72 ) are shown in the graph.,width=326 ]    figure  [ f : dead_masstime ] shows the correlation between the signal to reduced background ratio r and the dead mass - time fraction d for borexino , as a function of spatial  ( @xmath58 ) and time  ( @xmath59 ) efficiencies for @xmath0c events rejection . in table  [ tableratio ] we show the optimal values of the dead mass - time fraction d for the three experiments for fixed and given values of the ratio r between signal and reduced @xmath0c background .",
    "the values are calculated by minimizing the dead mass - time fraction d while keeping the product of the two efficiencies @xmath58 , @xmath59 constrained to the value of @xmath57 corresponding to the chosen value of r.    dddd & 0.05 & 0.4 & 36 + & & & + & & & + 0.1 & 0.4 & & + 0.2 & 11.6 & & + 0.3 & 50.6 & & + 0.4 & 87.4 & < 0.1 & + 0.5 & 98.8 & < 0.1 & + 0.8 & > 99.9 & 0.1 & + 1 & & 0.3 & + 2 & & 6.7 & + 3 & & 27.8 & + 4 & & 58.3 & + 5 & & 85.3 & + 8 & & > 99.9 & + 100 & & & < 0.1 + 500 & & & 2.6 +    further improvements of these figures might be achieved by the experiments by optimizing the set of cuts used to tag @xmath0c events with the double muon and neutron coincidence according to each detector s capabilities and performance .",
    "for example , the accurate reconstruction of the track of the through - going muons might help reducing the dead mass - time by modifying the topology of the spatial cut proposed in this study , such as limiting the volume of the region excluded by the cuts to an intersection of a cylinder around the muon track and of a sphere centered around the neutron capture point , as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the technique offers as a by - product the possibility of determining the total number of @xmath0c decays in the detector .",
    "the residual background b can then be statistically subtracted from the spectrum of the reduced data set .",
    "let t be the total rate in the pep window after applying the muon+neutron tagging technique . under the assumption that the internal and the external background rates are negligible with respect to the residual background from @xmath0c and to the signal rates , @xmath73 .",
    "a lower bound on the statistical error associated with the signal rate s extrapolated with the statistical subtraction of the energy spectra is obtained by propagating the errors in the formula just introduced :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 are , respectively , the total number of events recorded , the total number of signal events and the total number of background events ( all after application of the cuts to reduce the background from @xmath0c ) , t@xmath25 is the data taking time and m is the fiducial mass for pep and cno neutrinos observation . the formula above can be used to obtain information concerning the statistical accuracy of the measurement of the signal rate .",
    "borexino ( kamland ) with a 70-ton ( 300-ton ) fiducial mass would achieve a statistical accuracy of 2.9% ( 3.4% ) in 5 years .",
    "in this paper we presented a study of the production mechanism of @xmath0c nuclides in muon - induced showers .",
    "we identified the nuclear reactions relevant for the production of the nuclide in muon - induced showers in organic liquid scintillators .",
    "we performed an _ ab initio _ calculation of the production rates for each channel , then compared the calculated total production rate with available experimental data , obtaining a good agreement .",
    "we estimated that for 95% of the @xmath0c nuclides produced at least one neutron is emitted .",
    "a possible experiment located at snolab has a very low muon flux and hence a @xmath0c production rate which is negligible when compared with the expected rate from pep and cno neutrinos . on the other hand , for both borexino and kamland ,",
    "cosmogenic @xmath0c is a significant background for the detection of pep and cno solar neutrinos .",
    "we discussed a reduction technique for the @xmath0c events , based on one - by - one identification through the coincidence between a parent muon and the resulting neutron capture .",
    "we estimated that both borexino and kamland could use the technique to increase the original signal ( pep+cno neutrinos ) to background ( @xmath0c ) ratio by a significant factor .",
    "borexino can improve from a signal / background ratio of 0.4 to one of 2 ( 4 ) while losing 7% ( 58% ) of the data to dead mass - time .",
    "kamland can improve its signal / background ratio from 0.05 to 0.2 ( 0.3 ) while losing 12% ( 51% ) of data to dead mass - time .",
    "the residual @xmath0c background can be statistically subtracted to determine the signal rate from neutrinos .",
    "we presented a formula providing a crude estimate of the statistical error associated with the signal rate determined with this procedure .",
    "we estimated that both borexino and kamland could measure the combined rate from pep and cno neutrinos in the [ 0.8 - 1.3  mev ] window down to a 3% statistical accuracy in five years , provided that internal and external background rates are kept within figures negligible with respect to the signal rate .",

    "<S> several possible background sources determine the detectability of pep and cno solar neutrinos in organic liquid scintillator detectors . among such sources , </S>",
    "<S> the cosmogenic @xmath0c nuclide plays a central role . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0c is produced underground in reactions induced by the residual cosmic muon flux . </S>",
    "<S> experimental data available for the effective cross section for @xmath0c by muons indicate that @xmath0c will be the dominant source of background for the observation of pep and cno neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0c decays are expected to total a rate 2.5 ( 20 ) times higher than the combined rate of pep and cno neutrinos in borexino ( kamland ) in the energy window preferred for the pep measurement , between 0.8 and 1.3  mev .    </S>",
    "<S> this study examines the production mechanism of @xmath0c by muon - induced showers in organic liquid scintillators with a novel approach : for the first time , we perform a detailed _ ab initio _ calculation of the production of a cosmogenic nuclide , @xmath0c , taking into consideration all relevant production channels . results of the calculation are compared with the effective cross sections measured by target experiments in muon beams .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper also discusses a technique for reduction of background from @xmath0c in organic liquid scintillator detectors , which allows to identify on a one - by - one basis and remove from the data set a large fraction of @xmath0c decays . </S>",
    "<S> the background reduction technique hinges on an idea proposed by martin deutsch , who suggested that a neutron must be ejected in every interaction producing a @xmath0c nuclide from @xmath1c . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0c events are tagged by a three - fold coincidence with the parent muon track and the subsequent neutron capture on protons . </S>"
