    "this paper is the fourth in a series@xcite investigating the use of `` counter - propagating wave methods '' ( cpwms)@xcite for solving the time - independent  equation exactly .",
    "the basic idea is to decompose the stationary wavefunction , @xmath1 , into a two - term , or `` bipolar '' form , = + , [ psitot ] such that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent wave `` components '' moving in opposite directions .",
    "although is exact , the particular bipolar decomposition used is chosen to correspond to analogous approximate semiclassical wave components.@xcite for smooth potentials , the latter are known to exhibit smooth and slowly - varying field functions throughout the interaction region .",
    "the exact @xmath2 of must behave similarly , at least in the classical limit , and in any case lead to field functions that are much better behaved than for @xmath1 itself . for stationary scattering states , for instance",
    ", @xmath1 necessarily exhibits oscillatory interference in one or more asymptotic regions where the interaction potential @xmath6 is flat , whereas the asymptotic @xmath7 and @xmath8 behave as plane waves .",
    "thus , interference manifests not in the individual components , but arises naturally from their linear superposition .    apart from certain conceptual and theoretical advantages , the above picture is particularly relevant for quantum trajectory methods ( qtms),@xcite  i.e . , trajectory - based numerical techniques for performing exact quantum dynamics calculations , in a manner similar to classical simulations.@xcite qtms that are based on standard bohmian mechanics@xcite use a single - term or `` unipolar '' representation of the wavefunction , from which the quantum trajectory evolution is determined .",
    "however , the bohmian time evolution equations are nonlinear , which can lead to radically different qtm behavior when applied to the individual bipolar components of , rather than to @xmath1 itself .",
    "in particular , the smooth field functions of the @xmath2 obviate the `` node problem''i.e .",
    "the near - singularities in the quantum potential , @xmath9 , leading to numerical instabilities in the quantum trajectory evolution when there is substantial interference.@xcite a more detailed discussion may be found in the previous articles cited above .    for one - dimensional ( 1d ) stationary scattering state calculations , the bipolar cpwm trajectories are actually _ classical _ , in a certain generalized sense ( sec .",
    "[ theory ] and ref .  ) .",
    "quantum effects arise not from a quantum potential , @xmath9 , impacting trajectory evolution , but rather through dynamical coupling between the two components , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this coupling , which is in essence proportional to the interaction potential , induces @xmath3 transitions ",
    "i.e . , scattering from the @xmath4 incident / transmitted wave to the @xmath5 reflected wave , and vice - versa . in many respects ,",
    "the situation is reminiscent of traditional multisurface scattering theory , in which an off - diagonal diabatic coupling potential induces a dynamical transition from one diabatic state to another . indeed , one somewhat compelling conclusion of the present work  which deals with a bipolar cpwm treatment of multisurface dynamics ",
    "is that in some sense _ both types of transitions may be regarded as different aspects of the same underlying phenomenon_. this `` unification '' may result in an interesting cross - fertilization of ideas , e.g. in the area of classical trajectory surface hopping ( tsh ) methodologies , originally designed by tully.@xcite    we are by no means the first to apply qtms to the dynamics of electronic nonadiabatic collisions ; the first papers to do so were written several years ago by wyatt and coworkers.@xcite it should be noted that wyatt s treatment is exact  at least formally  although approximate and/or classical versions have also been developed.@xcite these methods are often compared to tsh , with which they ( and the present approach ) have important differences . in tsh ,",
    "a swarm of independent classical trajectories evolve along a given potential energy surface ; for each trajectory , a decision is made whether to `` hop '' to a different surface , based upon a transition probability , obtained by integrating coupled equations for the electronic amplitudes .",
    "in contrast , the above multisurface methods do not involve any trajectory hopping ( the number of trajectories evolving on each electronic surface is , in fact , conserved ) but transfer density and phase information from one state to another in a continuous manner .",
    "note that  like its single surface counterpart  the multisurface qtm of wyatt et al .",
    "is based on a unipolar representation of the wavefunction , and is therefore also subject to numerical instabilities due to interferences .",
    "moreover , in the multisurface case , interference arises not only from waves propagating in opposite directions on the same surface , but also from waves transferring flux from one surface to another .",
    "it should also be stated that in the multisurface context , the idea of applying a bipolar decomposition has been previously considered . in particular , m. alexander and coworkers",
    "adopted such a scheme in the exact quantum solution of the close - coupling equations using log - derivative propagation,@xcite although their choice of decomposition does not avoid oscillatory field functions , and is therefore not so useful for qtms .",
    "d. v. shalashilin also used a bipolar decomposition to solve the close - coupling equations ( for inelastic scattering applications ) , albeit only as a semiclassical approximation.@xcite    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "[ singlesurf ] ) and the multisurface case ( secs .",
    "[ multisurftheory ] and  [ multisurfalg ] ) .",
    "note that the bipolar cpwm algorithms used here require neither complex scaling@xcite nor absorbing potentials@xcite  a decided advantage over other quantum scattering methods .",
    "moreover , the scaling of computational ( cpu ) effort is linear with the grid size , @xmath10 , rather than proportional to @xmath11 .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "in several previous articles,@xcite an extremely accurate , efficient , and robust bipolar cpwm numerical algorithm was developed for computing stationary scattering states of 1d single - surface systems .",
    "a brief summary is presented here ; further details can be found in the above - referenced articles .    the algorithm is a time - dependent relaxation method , for which the initial wavefunction is a left - incident / transmitted wave only , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 . over time , a reflected wave @xmath14 comes into being through interaction region coupling due to the potential energy , and eventually @xmath15 relaxes to the true stationary eigenstate of desired energy , @xmath16 , and left - incident boundary conditions . the solution components @xmath17 behave as ( right / left ) traveling plane waves in both asymptotes , except that @xmath18 .",
    "the asymptotic square amplitudes , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are directly related to transmission and reflection probabilities , respectively [ ] . through the interaction region ,",
    "the solution @xmath17 s are exact quantum analogues of a type of semiclassical wkb approximation resulting from the `` generalized frman '' ( f ) approach.@xcite amplitude and phase functions for the @xmath2 components are expected to be smooth and slowly varying , unlike those for the solution @xmath1 itself .",
    "the `` generalized '' aspect of the above methodology implies that we are formally allowed to specify the `` classical '' trajectories as we wish , using an effective potential @xmath21 of our own choosing , rather than the actual potential @xmath22 . in practice",
    ", the method requires that @xmath23 , and works best when @xmath21 is smooth and monotonic between the two asymptotes .",
    "this ensures that all trajectories are devoid of turning points , and that there is no asymptotic coupling between the two @xmath2 components .",
    "note that the @xmath24 trajectories move to the right with velocity @xmath25 , and the @xmath26 trajectories move to the left with equal and opposite velocity @xmath27 .",
    "as per other qtm s , the trajectories give rise to discrete moving grids , which carry local phase and amplitude information for the appropriate @xmath2 component .",
    "there is no quantum potential@xcite contributing to the dynamics ; all trajectories are ( generalized ) classical , and can be determined _ a priori_. instead , quantum effects manifest via @xmath2 coupling in the interaction region  as evidenced by the time evolution equations ( ref .",
    "( 16 ) , or of this article with @xmath28 ) .",
    "the coupling is essentially proportional to the interaction potential , and can be said to induce transitions from one @xmath2 component to the other .    in the previous papers ,",
    "various numerical innovations were introduced to improve performance and stability of the trajectory - based time propagation of @xmath2 , designed to deal effectively with the unusual mixed boundary conditions [ ] .",
    "first , since the upper ( @xmath29 ) and lower ( @xmath30 ) grids are moving in opposite directions , they can not be commensurate at all times .",
    "however , a scheme was introduced whereby these two grids are commensurate at all times @xmath31 equal to a multiple of the `` shift time , '' @xmath32the time it takes one grid point to travel to the location vacated by its nearest neighbor .",
    "a constraint on @xmath32 is that it be a multiple of the propagation time step size , @xmath33 .",
    "second , since grids are generally incommensurate , interpolation must be used to evaluate the coupling contribution  a procedure found to yield far better results when applied to a _ polar _ ( amplitude / phase ) decomposition of the @xmath2 s , rather than directly to the @xmath2 s themselves .",
    "a `` plane wave propagator '' ( pwp ) approach was also employed , which effectively treats the uncoupled part of the time evolution equations exactly , and the coupled part using first - order euler time integration .",
    "unfortunately , the pwp idea is found to be generally incompatible with more efficient time integrators , such as fourth - order runge - kutta ( adaptive and non - adaptive ) , used here .",
    "note that for symmetric potential systems , it is possible to recast the time evolution equations in such a way that the pwp contribution vanishes ( by introducing a time - evolving phase into the definition of the wavefunction ) . in order to ascertain the extent to which pwp actually improves performance , some preliminary numerical tests were conducted for the eckart a system ( sec .  [ results ] ) with @xmath34 . in particular , an efficiency comparison was made between the original pwp algorithm and the `` phase - modified '' version  both using first - order euler propagation for the non - pwp contribution .",
    "for an identical set of numerical parameters , both methods performed about equally well , vis -  - vis the accuracy of the computed reflection and transmission probabilities  although the phase - modified version executed roughly @xmath35 faster , owing to less required computation . as a second , more realistic test , the phase - modified algorithm with fourth - order runge - kutta was compared to a straight fourth - order runge - kutta treatment of all terms in the original evolution equations ( including pwp terms ) . both methods again performed roughly equally well with respect to computed accuracy , with slight performance differences depending on the desired level of accuracy . moreover , both methods are far superior to the first - order euler methods , enabling @xmath33 values that are orders of magnitude larger , without compromising numerical accuracy .",
    "only the straight runge - kutta method can be generalized for asymmetric potential systems , however , and is introduced here as the general method of choice .",
    "we also introduce an improved method for dealing with extremal trajectories that stray outside the range of interpolation : instead of ignoring the coupling contribution altogether,@xcite we now simply use values for the polar field quantities obtained from the nearest extremal grid point  although it should be emphasized that the true coupling contribution is vanishingly small in the asymptotic limit .",
    "also , even within the range of interpolation , the interpolated density value may become slightly negative when the density absolute values are very small ; in that case , we now reset the interpolated value to zero .",
    "we now generalize the theory for the 1d multisurface case .",
    "note that only a brief summary is provided here , as the full derivation follows closely that of refs .  3 and  4 , which should be consulted for further details .",
    "let @xmath36 be the number of electronic states considered , with no restrictions on intersurface coupling .",
    "a diabatic - like time - independent matrix  equation is presumed , of the form = e , [ multise ] where @xmath37 comprise the vector components ( associated with each of the @xmath36 diabatic states ) of the nuclear wavefunction , @xmath38 , and _",

    "the @xmath43 are the diabatic potential energy curves , with the @xmath44 case denoting the coupling potentials . in order to ensure that coupling vanishes in the asympotic limits ( required to obtain asymptotic scattering waves with correct boundary conditions),@xcite we must have @xmath45 . however , the asymptotic values for the diagonal potentials , @xmath46 , are allowed to be completely arbitrary , and in particular , need not be symmetric . left and right",
    "asympotic values are denoted @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "for purposes of generating trajectories for motion on the @xmath49th diabatic state , a suitable family of @xmath36 effective potentials , @xmath50 , are introduced , such that @xmath51 ( to ensure against asymptotic coupling ) , and @xmath52 for all @xmath53 ( to avoid turning points , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ singlesurf ] ) .    assuming that each component of @xmath54 is decomposed into its own bipolar expansion , _",

    "one half of these are already provided in . for the remaining @xmath36 equations ,",
    "it is natural to apply the generalized @xmath56 approach ( sec .",
    "[ singlesurf ] ) in component - wise fashion .",
    "in particular , for a single - surface system , the generalized f approach@xcite provides the following as the second ( after the usual  equation ) independent differential condition ,  = -v",

    "the time evolution equations of the preceding paragraph ",
    "best exemplified by offer a coherent , unified picture of scattering theory that places both intersurface transitions and @xmath3 transitions on a near - equal footing .",
    "note first that coupling of all types vanishes in both asymptotic limits , resulting in uncoupled , scattering plane wave dynamics in these limits for all @xmath66 , as desired .",
    "in particular , @xmath67 is a plane wave propagating to the ( right / left ) with uniform speed @xmath68 .",
    "it is the various potential interactions , operating in the interaction region , that induce transitions of all kinds among the @xmath55 bipolar cpwm components , @xmath69 .",
    "the off - diagonal potentials @xmath59 are responsible for transitions between diabatic states @xmath49 and @xmath64 , whereas the diagonal potentials @xmath70 induce transitions from reactive ( transmitted ) @xmath71 to non - reactive ( reflected ) @xmath72 components ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "apart from this distinction , both types of transitions manifest similarly in the equations of motion .    as in the previous work,@xcite",
    "the time evolution equations above give rise to some elegant flux properties , which again treat both types of transitions ( or probability flow ) on a near - equal footing .",
    "let @xmath73 be the flux for component @xmath66 , defined in terms of the generalized trajectory velocities @xmath74 , and the component probability densities , @xmath75 .",
    "we also find it convenient to introduce new composite labels , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , to label individual @xmath66 components .",
    "note that the @xmath78 values are _ independent _ for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , so that each of these two component labels can take on @xmath55 distinct values .",

    "( 15 ) .      to implement the above time evolution equations numerically ,",
    "we must first discuss boundary conditions and initial value conditions . without loss of generality , we may assume an incoming wave that is left - incident on the diabatic state @xmath92 .",
    "probability flow from @xmath93 to the other cpwm components occurs only in the interaction region , and then propagates outward towards the appropriate asymptotes . adopting the usual normalization convention thus leads to the following boundary conditions : in above , @xmath94 is a time - dependent phase factor .    as for the initial value , we take @xmath95 for all @xmath79 except @xmath96 , for which the basic wkb solution is used , as described in ref .",

    "in most respects , the numerical algorithm employed for the time evolution is identical to that discussed in sec .",
    "[ singlesurf ] .",
    "one complicating factor is that the trajectories [ determined from @xmath100 are obviously completely different from one diabatic state , @xmath49 , to the next . in a single - surface calculation ,",
    "the @xmath29 and @xmath30 grid points move in opposite directions .",
    "thus , the two grids must be incommensurate for most times , although a simple scheme is used to ensure commensurate grids when @xmath31 is a multiple of the shift time , @xmath32 . starting at the left edge of the grid , @xmath101 , one propagates a _ single _",
    "trajectory , @xmath102 . the initial grid for both @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "is then taken to be the values @xmath103 for nonnegative integers , @xmath104 such that @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the right edge of the grid.@xcite    in the multisurface case , the trajectories at a given point @xmath53 move with different speeds for different @xmath49 values , thus rendering it impossible for grids to be commensurate across diabatic states , even at regular time intervals . a reasonable procedure",
    ", however , is to apply the above in component - wise fashion , i.e. by generating a family of @xmath36 trajectories , @xmath107 .",
    "if the same @xmath32 value is used for all @xmath49 , then at intervals @xmath108 , the @xmath109 and @xmath110 grids will be commensurate with each other , for all @xmath49 ( but still not _ across _ @xmath49 values ) .",
    "the nonuniform grids generated in this fashion will be denser where @xmath74 is smaller  which is physically reasonable , and in any event is also true in the single - surface case . to evaluate the intersurface coupling contribution in",
    ", a polar intersurface grid interpolation scheme is used , exactly analogous to that used for @xmath3 coupling in the single - surface case .",
    "note that all grids extend over the full coordinate range , i.e. roughly from @xmath101 to @xmath106 .",
    "in this section , we discuss the application of the numerical algorithms described in sec .",
    "[ theory ] to a variety of model systems .",

    ", the precise convergence procedure followed is that described in ref .  , with one exception : since `` oscillatory error '' was always found to be negligible , reflection and transmission probabilities are defined here to be rather than as described in ref .  .",

    "[ singlesurf ] ) , our first task is to evaluate the numerical efficacy of the present approach for single surface systems .",
    "in particular , we apply the method to a `` test suite '' of 1d benchmark applications@xcite exhibiting a range of different attributes with regard to tunneling , barrier height and width , exoergicity , existence of reaction intermediates , and desired level of computational accuracy . in doing so",
    ", the robustness and stability of the method will be evaluated , as well as the numerical efficiency , as compared with the previous codes .",
    "only a brief description of the individual test suite applications will be provided here ; for additional details , the previous papers may be consulted .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the first investigation , we computed @xmath117 and @xmath118 for each of the five test suite potentials above , at an energy @xmath119 or @xmath120 ( table  [ pottab ] , row 1 ) chosen to yield both substantial reflection and transmission .",
    "the results are presented in columns ii , iv , and vii  ix of table  [ pottab ] .",
    "the computed @xmath117 and @xmath118 values ( table  [ pottab ] , rows  8 and  9 ) were both converged to an absolute accuracy of around @xmath121 ( last digit uncertain ) . for the eckart  a system ( column ii ) ,",
    "all parameters were taken directly from ref .  , except for the fixed ( non - adaptive ) runge - kutta time step size , @xmath33 , which was reconverged . for all other applications ,",
    "a full reconvergence of all parameters was performed , as discussed above .",
    "for some systems , a direct comparison can be made between computed and exact ( rows  10 and  11 ) @xmath117 and @xmath118 values .",
    "for the eckart systems , the exact results are known analytically.@xcite for the uphill ramp system , `` exact '' values were obtained from a much more accurate numerical calculation , converged to at least eight significant digits .    in comparison with the corresponding calculations in ref .",
    ", the converged parameter values are for the most part very similar , as expected .",
    "the glaring exception , of course , is the time step size , @xmath33 , whose values are found here to be _ much _ larger than in ref .  , owing to the use of fourth - order time integrators .",
    "more significant , however , is the fact that the present @xmath33 values are substantially larger than those of ref .  , which _ also _ employed non - adaptive fourth - order runge - kutta integration . for eckart",
    "a for instance ( column ii ) , the respective @xmath33 values ( in atomic units ) are as follows : ref .  , 0.156 ; ref .  , 10.0 ; present work , 156 .",
    "the latter value is indeed very large for the level of accuracy achieved , and can be attributed to the numerical improvements introduced in ref .  .",
    "remarkably , an even larger @xmath33 could in principle have been used here , but the value given is already so large that @xmath122 .",
    "thus , over a single time step , each grid point moves to a neighboring site  resulting in an effectively `` fixed '' grid that obviates both spatial differentiation@xcite _ and _ interpolation . with regard to cpu effort ,",
    "the eckart a calculation performed here required 4.5 ms on a 2.60 ghz pentium cpu , as compared with 1.7 s for ref .  .",
    "this reduction in cpu time is not as large as the @xmath123 factor predicted by the increase in @xmath33 , owing to the fact that each runge - kutta iteration requires additional computation , but is nevertheless very substantial ; the present calculation is also orders of magnitude faster than the corresponding ref",
    ".   calculation .",
    "in addition to the above investigation , we also examined the present method s ability to provide extremely accurate results .",
    "this was done in two distinct ways .",
    "first , a very deep tunneling study of the eckart  b system was performed , as presented in table  [ pottab ] , columns v and vi . in effect , such a study evaluates absolute accuracy rather than precision ",
    "column vi , for which the transmission probability is around @xmath124 , but is computed to only three significant digits .",
    "the method clearly works well in this context  although the greater the absolute accuracy level , the less the improvement relative to ref .  .",
    "for the @xmath125 case , for instance , @xmath33 increases by only a factor of @xmath126 , which is less than @xmath32 , but only by a factor of two ( table  [ pottab ] , row 6 ) .",
    "second , in order to evaluate _",
    "precision _ rather than absolute accuracy , we also performed an extremely accurate calculation of the @xmath34 eckart  a system , for which both @xmath117 and @xmath118 were computed to _ eleven _ significant digits ( table  [ pottab ] , column iii ) .",
    "as compared with column ii , the time step is reduced to an extent that is quantitatively consistent with a fourth - order integration method .",
    "the corresponding increase in grid size is difficult to predict quantitatively , but interestingly , is found to be such that the @xmath127 ratio is again not far from one . even for this extremely challenging application , the total cpu time required is only 36 seconds .    despite the substantial breadth of the test suite applications considered , in all cases , the @xmath127 ratios are on the order of one ( table  [ pottab ] , row 6)a situation that bears further scrutiny .",
    "accordingly , we conducted an additional calculation of the eckart a system using _ adaptive _ ( cash - karp ) fifth - order runge - kutta integration@xcite  the idea being that an adaptive method should automatically find the most appropriate time step sizes to use .",
    "in fact , using parameters similar to column ii , and specifying a target accuracy of @xmath128 , we found the resultant @xmath33 values to be almost always equal to @xmath32 , except for the first few time steps , which had much smaller @xmath33 values .",
    "the resultant computed transmission and reflection probability errors ( relative to exact analytical values ) conform to the target accuracy level .",
    "one might conclude from the above that the corresponding _ non_-adaptive calculation using fixed @xmath122 would yield similar results .",
    "in fact , the latter calculation results in a near identical @xmath118 value , but a @xmath117 with an error of @xmath129 .",
    "thus , the initially small time steps appear to play a vital role , and also argue cogently in favor of adaptive time integration schemes .",
    "we also performed numerical calculations for a variety of benchmark multisurface applications for @xmath130 , as described below .",
    "* * pure coupling : * asymptotically symmetric , with @xmath131 and gaussian coupling .",

    "first , the present theory is restricted to potentials that are asymptotically flat in _ both _ asympotes , @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",

    "second , the intriguing result from table  [ pottab ] row 6 that @xmath127 is always on the order of one suggests that simply _ setting _ this value to one would not adversely affect numerical efficiency too severely . indeed , such a modification would lead to some decided numerical advantages , such as the use of fixed grids which would avoid the need for intrasurface ( but not intersurface ) interpolation .",
    "the resultant grid densities would be larger , however , and for this reason , such an approach might be substantially less efficient for high dimensionalities .",
