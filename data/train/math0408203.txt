    "a compact , nonempty set @xmath0 is called `` self - affine '' if it is the attractor of an iterated function system of affine maps .",
    "self - affine sets represent a natural class of fractal sets . on one hand , they are a natural generalization of self - similar sets . on the other hand , they appear in other areas , like theory of tilings and dynamical systems .",
    "they also represent a prototype for attractors of general , ( smooth ) non - linear i.f.s . despite these facts ,",
    "they remain rather mysterious , and the study of their dimensional and topological properties is fraught with difficulties .",
    "one of the most important results available is falconer s theorem from 1988 @xcite .",
    "it states that for every collection @xmath1 of linear endomorphisms of @xmath2 such that @xmath3 for all @xmath4 , there exists a number @xmath5 -called the `` falconer dimension '' of @xmath6- such that for almost every @xmath7 ( in the sense of @xmath8 dimensional lebesgue measure ) , the attractor of the i.f.s .",
    "@xmath9 has hausdorff and box - counting dimensions equal to @xmath10 .",
    "there is an explicit , albeit difficult to compute , formula for @xmath10 .",
    "( falconer s original version goes with @xmath11 as the bound for the norms ; later solomyak @xcite pointed out that @xmath12 works too ) .",
    "the hypothesis on the norms can be somewhat relaxed , but is essential .",
    "the simplest counterexample comes from the following family of self - affine sets , studied by f.przytycki and m.urbaski @xcite : for @xmath13 , let @xmath14 be the linear map given by @xmath15 let @xmath16 be the attractor of the i.f.s .",
    "@xmath17 . when @xmath18 these sets are easy to analyze , but the situation becomes much more complicated when @xmath19 . recall that the bernoulli convolution @xmath20 is defined as the distribution measure of the random sum @xmath21 , where the signs are chosen indepently with probabilty @xmath12 ; see @xcite , @xcite for further information on bernoulli convolutions . for us ,",
    "the main feature of bernoulli convolutions is the following theorem of solomyak @xcite : for almost all @xmath22 , @xmath20 is an abolustely continuous measure with an @xmath23 density .",
    "the result of przytycki and urbaski is the following : assume that @xmath16 is totally disconnected , and @xmath24 .",
    "if @xmath20 has hausdorff dimension @xmath25 ( which , by solomyak s theorem , is the case for almost every @xmath26 ) then @xmath27 however , if @xmath28 is a pisot number ( i.e. , an algebraic number greater than @xmath25 all of whose algebraic conjugates have modulus less than @xmath25 ) , then @xmath29 .",
    "it is well known that the set of pisot number accumulates to @xmath30 ; thus this implies that the norm bound in falconer s theorem is sharp .",
    "the result of przytycki and urbaski suggests the following question : what can we say about the dimension and topological properties of @xmath16 in general ; i.e. allowing @xmath16 to be connected ?",
    "we will show that the same formula for the dimension holds for almost every @xmath31 in the natural region .",
    "more precisely , we have :    [ th : main ] for almost @xmath31 such that @xmath32 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 .    note",
    "that a direct connection between absolute continuity of @xmath35 and dimension of @xmath16 is lost .",
    "this is natural since for countably many values of @xmath31 there is an exact coincidence of cylinders which produces a dimension drop . the condition @xmath36 is also a natural one ; for @xmath37 one would expect @xmath16 to have positive lebesgue measure , and even non - empty interior .",
    "unfortunately , since transversality holds only in a small region inside @xmath38 , our results here are rather limited .",
    "it is convenient to state the result in terms of measures .",
    "let @xmath39 be the natural self - affine measure supported on @xmath16 ; it can be defined in several ways , for instance as the distribution of the random sum @xmath40 where signs are chosen independently with probability @xmath12 .",
    "note the close analogy with bernoulli convolutions ; we think of @xmath39 as _ self - affine _ bernoulli convolutions .",

    ", @xmath16 has nonempty interior .",
    "see corollary [ coro : abscontregion ] for the precise definition of @xmath50 .",
    "we remark that our results apply to more general families of self - affine sets , although the theorems above illustrate our main motivation and example .",
    "see theorems [ th : generalth ] and [ th : generalthbis ] for the general versions , as well as the extensions and further generalizations presented in section [ sec : extensions ] .",
    "we stress , however , that we are considering only families of self - affine sets where all the defining maps share the same linear part , which is a diagonalizable map .",
    "the method used to prove theorems [ th : main ] and [ th : mainbis ] is based on the transversality ideas that were successfully applied to many families of self - similar sets , starting with @xcite ; however , some new ideas are needed as well . in particular , we emphasize that the powerful projection scheme developed in @xcite does not seem to apply in this context , for two reasons .",
    "first , we have to deal with two different hlder exponents simultaneously ; second , and more important , the standard notion of transversality does not hold in a large enough region . to overcome the second problem we use transversality concurrently with absolute continuity of bernoulli convolutions , rather than transversality alone .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : extensions ] we consider some additional questions suggested by what is known in the self - similar case .",
    "we study some families of exceptions to the almost - everywhere results ; most of them are closely related to pisot numbers .",
    "this is to be expected , since for classical bernoulli convolutions reciprocals of pisot numbers are the only known parameters that yield a singular measure .",
    "according to theorem [ th : main ] , overlaps do not produce a dimension drop in the region @xmath51 except for a set of zero measure .",
    "we show that they do produce a measure drop ( i.e. the hausdorff measure in the critical dimension is @xmath52 ) in a big chunk of the overlapping region .",
    "this phenomenon was first observed for families of self - similar sets .",
    "it is well known that if a measure is the attractor of a general i.f.s .",
    "then it is either singular or absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "a more delicate question is whether , when absolutely continuous , it is actually equivalent to lebesgue measure on the attractor set .",
    "this is known to be true for self - similar sets @xcite , and here we show that the proof in the self - similar case can be adapted to cover many self - affine measures including the natural measures on @xmath16 .",
    "in this section we obtain our main results on hausdorff and box - counting dimension of certain certain families of self - affine sets , of which the class discussed in the introduction is a particular example .",
    "let @xmath53 be a set of real numbers which we call `` digits '' .",
    "we will normalize @xmath54 so that @xmath55 .",
    "associated to @xmath54 is a family of linear self - similar sets @xmath56 for @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the attractor of the i.f.s .",
    "@xmath59 . furthermore ,",
    "let @xmath20 be the natural self - similar measure supported on @xmath58 ; i.e. the probability measure defined by the relation @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "now consider a two - dimensional version of this construction , where the i.f.s .",
    "is @xmath62 let @xmath16 be the attractor set , and @xmath39 the natural self - affine measure supported on it",
    ". these will be our main object of study in this paper .",
    "see figure 1 for some examples .        * figure 1*. both figures correspond to the digit set @xmath63 .",
    "although both pictures look similar , the one on the left actually corresponds to an attractor of dimension strictly less than @xmath30 , while for parameters close to the one on the right we know that the attractor typically has positive lebesgue measure . in general ,",
    "self - affine sets are harder to visualize than self - similar sets due to the fact that , after some iterations , cylinders sets have a very large excentricity .",
    "our most important example is the set of digits @xmath64 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath65 and @xmath66 are the classical and self - affine bernoulli convolutions respectively .",
    "more precisely , the measure defined by ( [ eq : randomsum ] ) corresponds to the digit set @xmath67 , but the digits @xmath63 yield the same measures up to rescaling and translating . for the sake of simplicity we will use the digits @xmath63 at all places except where we are dealing with the fourier transform , for which the digits",
    "@xmath67 yield a slightly simpler formula .",
    "next we define a relevant class of power series .",
    "let @xmath68 let also @xmath69 be the subset of @xmath70 of power series with non - zero constant term .",
    "moreover , define @xmath71 as @xmath72 ; in other words , @xmath71 is the set of power series whose first non - zero coefficient is @xmath73",
    ". we will identify ( subsets of ) @xmath70 with ( subsets of ) the symbolic space @xmath74 .    as a matter of notational convenience we will often write @xmath75 instead of @xmath76 , and @xmath77 instead of @xmath78 .",
    "when we do so , we will use greek letters such as @xmath79 instead of @xmath80 .",
    "we will need a notion of transversality for power series .",
    "our definition is very close to the standard one ; however , we need to consider subsets of the class @xmath69 of power series rather than all of @xmath69 .",

    "one easy but important observation is that to prove transversality it is enough to show if @xmath92 then @xmath93 for all @xmath94 and some @xmath95 .",

    "when there are overlaps , it is no longer so clear what happens to the box dimension , but in principle there is no reason to believe it will also drop .",
    "second , the function @xmath502 that appeared in the course of the proof is actually ( the negative of ) the @xmath527-spectrum of @xmath20 .",
    "the fact that @xmath502 is strictly convex corresponds , under the multifractal formalism , to the fact that @xmath20 is a multifractal measure ; i.e. it has a range of local dimensions .",
    "in general , the left and right derivatives of the @xmath527-spectrum at @xmath25 give substantial information about the measure ; see for example @xcite .",
    "thus the proof is another indication of the delicate relationship between bernoulli convolutions and the sets @xmath16 .",
    "_ proof_. the first part is clear from theorem [ th : dimdrop ] . for the second part , note that when @xmath533 , we have that @xmath534 ( since @xmath530 ) and the falconer dimension is exactly @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the second part follows from the continuity of the drop in theorem [ th : dimdrop ] .",
    "@xmath154    interestingly , there are exactly two pisot numbers whose reciprocals are greater than @xmath535 .",
    "the smallest pisot number is the real root of @xmath536 , which is about @xmath537 .",
    "the second smallest pisot number is the positive root of the polynomial @xmath538 ; it is about @xmath539 .",
    "the next pisot number is the positive root of @xmath540 , which is already greater than @xmath541 .",
    "see @xcite , theorem 7.2.1 . for a proof of these facts .      in this subsection",
    "we assume @xmath245 .",
    "we showed that when the falconer dimension is less than @xmath30 , the hausdorff dimension of @xmath16 is almost everywhere equal to the falconer dimension .",
    "hence it is natural to ask what is the hausdorff measure in the critical dimension @xmath542 . unlike the self - similar case , this is a non - trivial question even in the strong separation case , provided @xmath543 ( otherwise @xmath16 can be seen to be bi - lipschitz equivalent to the cantor set @xmath58 ) .",
