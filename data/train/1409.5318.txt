    "reliable detailed information on the contact patterns occurring between individuals in day - to - day life contexts carries a great value in fields such as social sciences or epidemiology of infectious diseases , in which human interactions are of primary importance .",
    "in particular , the investigation of contact patterns in contexts where a substantial amount of social mixing between individuals is expected , such as schools , high schools or workplaces , represents an important research goal . for instance , the strong mixing of school children favors the spread of infectious diseases in school environmentx and makes them an important source of infection into households from where infections can spread further  @xcite . in such contexts , a precise description of human contacts can help identify possible contagion pathways , design realistic models of epidemic spread and design and evaluate containment strategies such as targeted vaccination , social distancing or school or workplace closures .    many efforts have therefore been devoted to the collection of data on human contact patterns in various settings and environments in the last years  @xcite .",
    "the research community has moreover started to systematically take advantage of recent technological advances to move from methods ranging from diaries and surveys  @xcite to new technologies based on wearable sensors able to detect close proximity  @xcite and even face - to - face contacts of individuals  @xcite .",
    "biases due to self - reporting are thus avoided @xcite and high - resolution data can be collected in an objective way , allowing to parametrize and inform data - driven models describing human behavior @xcite and epidemic spread in specific settings @xcite .    thanks to the use of wearable sensors , face - to - face contact data collected in unsupervised fashion in different contexts have thus started to become available , providing the beginning of an `` atlas '' of human contacts : the contexts investigated include conferences @xcite , a museum @xcite , a primary school @xcite , in which a strong impact of the class and age structure on the contact patterns was evidentiated , and hospitals @xcite .",
    "many contexts remain however to be investigated .",
    "moreover , the longitudinal dimension of contact patterns has barely been studied @xcite , and data sets describing face - to - face contacts in a given population or in a given setting but at different times have to our knowledge not been collected or analyzed . here",
    ", we partially address this issue , and give a new contribution to the collection of contact patterns in diverse environments , by presenting two high - resolution data sets describing the contacts between students in a high school .",
    "these data were collected in a french high school in 2011 and 2012 using a proximity - sensing platform based on wearable sensors .",
    "we investigate the mixing patterns of students as described by their high - resolution temporal contact network .",
    "we study how the mixing is driven by the repartition of students into classes and investigate if gender differences have an impact on contact patterns , as observed in primary school @xcite .",
    "we moreover study the evolution of the contact patterns on two widely distinct different timescales : on the one hand , we examine the stability of the contact networks and mixing patterns in a given population of students from one day to the next ; on the other hand , we take advantage of the fact that the two data sets were collected in the same environment ( even if the students changed from one year to the next ) to study the long term stability of contact patterns in the high school . finally , we make available on a dedicated webpage ( ` http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/ ` ) a novel instance of a high - resolution time - varying network of contacts between individuals , which can be of interest to the wide interdisciplinary research community studying complex and temporal networks .",
    "we collected data on the close proximity face - to - face encounters of high school students of several classes in lyce thiers , marseilles , france during 4 days ( tuesday to friday ) in dec .",
    "2011 and during 7 days ( from a monday to the tuesday of the following week ) in nov . 2012 .",
    "the data collection involved students of three different classes in 2011 ( gathering 118 students ) and of five classes ( gathering 180 students ) in 2012 .",
    "the three classes participating in 2011 were among the five of 2012 , albeit with different students .",
    "these classes , called `` classes prparatoires '' , are specific to the french schooling system .",
    "they gather students for studies that take place after the end of the usual high school studies and last two years . during these two years",
    ", students still study in a high school environment but are de facto mostly separated from the younger high school students , as their classes are located in a different part of the high school building and as they take their lunches separately . at the end of these two years , students go through competitive exams yielding admission to various higher education colleges .",
    "the data collection involved classes corresponding to the second year of such studies , in which students focus on different topics : `` mp '' classes focus more on mathematics and physics , `` pc '' classes on physics and chemistry , and `` psi '' classes on engineering studies .",
    "all students in this second year must prepare a small project that they present at the exam , and several students could build a project based on their participation to the data collection , together with the use of the collected data in some small scale analysis or numerical simulation . thanks to their involvement , the participation of students to the data collection was close to @xmath0 .",
    "we however limited the data collection to those classes in which at least one student would prepare a project based on the data , as engagement is a well - known issue that is efficiently solved through this kind of incentive @xcite .",
    "in particular , first year students did not participate , and some classes participating in the 2012 study were not included in the first study ( 2011 ) .",
    "the comparison between the data sets of the two distinct years will be performed taking this point into account .",
    "overall , we thus obtain data concerning the contacts of a specific set of students for each year , corresponding to a specific set of classes , and the data do not contain contacts with individuals not taking part to the study .",
    "importantly , the study considers whole classes , and not a subset of students in each class ( this is important because most contacts occur within classes as we will see later on ) .",
    "moreover , second year students themselves assert that they almost do not have any contacts with first year students .",
    "data were gathered using the measurement platform developed by the sociopatterns collaboration @xcite : it is based on wearable sensors that are embedded in unobtrusive wearable badges and exchange ultra - low power radio packets in order to detect close proximity of individuals wearing them @xcite . as described in detail elsewhere @xcite , the power level",
    "is tuned so that devices can exchange packets only when located within 1 - 1.5 meters of one another , and individuals are asked to wear the devices on their chests using lanyards , ensuring that the devices of two individuals can only exchange radio packets when the persons are facing each other .",
    "moreover , the wearable sensors are tuned so that the face - to - face proximity of two individuals wearing them can be assessed over an interval of @xmath1 seconds with a probability in excess of @xmath2 .",
    "two individuals are thus said to be in contact if their badges exchange radio packets during a 20-second time window , and the contact event is considered interrupted if the badges do not exchange packets over a 20-second interval . finally , the information on face - to - face proximity events detected by the wearable sensors is relayed to radio receivers installed throughout the high school : contacts occurring outside the school premises were not measured .      before the study",
    ", students and teachers were informed on the details and aims of the study .",
    "a signed informed consent was obtained for each participating individual ( no minors were involved as students of these classes were all aged at least 18 ) .",
    "all participants were given a wearable sensor and asked to wear it at all times in the high school .",
    "no personal information was collected : the only information associated with the unique identifier of each badge was the class and the gender of the corresponding individual .",
    "the ethics committee responsible for this kind of data collection , which is the french national bodies responsible for ethics and privacy , namely the commission nationale de linformatique et des liberts ( cnil , http://www.cnil.fr ) approved the study , as well as the high school authorities .",
    "+      at the most detailed level , the data collecting infrastructure yields a temporal network of contacts with a temporal resolution of @xmath1 seconds @xcite . starting from these data , we analyze the patterns of contacts between students and between classes at different temporal and structural aggregation levels . in the following ,",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 denote individual sensor identification numbers , while @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote classes .",
    "we first compute the number of contact events of each individual , the statistical distribution of the duration of such events , and of the time between successive contacts of an individual .",
    "we moreover build aggregated contact networks on several time windows : in each of these networks , nodes represent individuals and a weighted link between two nodes represents the fact that the two corresponding individuals have been in contact at least once during the aggregation time window . for each time window , we can define the following quantities :    * @xmath7 is 1 if and only if @xmath3 and @xmath4 have been in contact : this corresponds to the adjacency matrix of the contact network aggregated over the considered time window , * the degree @xmath8 of a node gives the number of distinct persons with whom @xmath3 has been in contact during the time window , * @xmath9 gives the number of contact events recorded between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath10 ) during the time window , * the weight @xmath11 of the link between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is defined by the cumulative duration of the @xmath9 contacts between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath12 ) which occurred during the time window , * the strength of a node @xmath3 , @xmath13 , gives the sum of the durations of the contacts of individual @xmath3 during the time window .",
    "we investigate the statistical distributions of the degrees and weights in the aggregated networks .",
    "for each distribution , we compute average and coefficient of variation squared @xmath14 ( squared ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the distribution : @xmath15 corresponds to distributions with low variance , while @xmath16 is obtained for high - variance distributions ) .",
    "we also compare the properties of networks aggregated over different time windows , and the evolution of some nodes properties ( degree and strength ) when the aggregation time window length increases . at a finer resolution",
    ", we moreover investigate the similarly between the neighborhoods of a given node in contact networks aggregated over different periods .",
    "for instance , for daily aggregated networks , the similarity between the neighborhoods of an individual @xmath3 in the contact networks measured in two different days denoted 1 and 2 is measured through the cosine similarity @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the weight of the link between @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the contact network of day @xmath19 , i.e. , the cumulative duration of the contacts between @xmath3 and @xmath4 occurring on day @xmath19 .",
    "the cosine similarity takes values between @xmath20 and @xmath21 : it is equal to @xmath20 if @xmath3 had contact with strictly different individuals in the two days considered , and to @xmath21 if @xmath3 had contacts with the same persons in both days , with proportional durations .    as students are divided into classes , we moreover aggregated the data in order to study the mixing patterns between classes .",
    "the number of students in class @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "we consider the following quantities , aggregated over each time window of interest :    * the number of edges between students of class @xmath5 with students of class @xmath6 in the aggregated contact network : @xmath23 for @xmath24 ( and @xmath25 ) , * the density of edges between class @xmath5 and class @xmath6 : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the maximum possible number of edges between class @xmath5 and class @xmath6 ( @xmath28 ) . *",
    "the total number of contacts between students of class @xmath5 with students of class @xmath6 : @xmath29 ( for @xmath30 we have @xmath31 ) , * the average number of contacts of a student of class @xmath5 with students of class @xmath6 @xmath32 , * the total time spent in contact between students of class @xmath5 with students of class @xmath6 : @xmath33 ( for @xmath30 we have @xmath34 ) , * the average time spent by a student of class @xmath5 in contact with students of class @xmath6 : @xmath35 .",
    "the quantities @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 define contact matrices that describe the mixing patterns between the classes . in order to investigate the temporal stability of these patterns , we moreover consider",
    "the similarity between two matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 of size @xmath41 , describing the contact matrices in different time windows , defined as @xmath42 this similarity takes values between @xmath20 and @xmath21 : it is equal to @xmath21 if the elements of both matrices are proportional ( @xmath43 for all @xmath44 , with @xmath45 independent of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , and @xmath20 if each time one element of @xmath39 is non - zero , the corresponding element of @xmath40 is zero and vice - versa .",
    "the class names , the number of individuals of each gender and in each class are given respectively in tables [ table:1 ] and [ table:2 ] for each year . in order to avoid repetitions",
    ", we mainly report here results corresponding to the data collection performed in 2012 .",
    "a comparison between the two data sets is performed later on .",
    ".classes involved in the 2011 data collection [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +        figure [ fig : pk_years ] displays the distributions of node degrees and link weights of the contact networks obtained in 2011 and 2012 , aggregated over the whole data collection duration , as well as the distributions of contact durations .",
    "all distributions are very similar , with an exponential decrease at large degree values for the degree distributions , and very broad weights and contact duration distributions which collapse on top of each other for the data obtained in the different years .",
    "figure [ cm_years ] moreover displays the contact matrices describing the structure and numbers of contacts between classes . as the data collection of 2012 involved more classes than the one of 2011 ,",
    "we evaluate the similarity between the contact patterns of two years by computing the similarity between the matrices collected in 2011 and the contact matrices restricted to the three classes pc , pc@xmath46 and psi@xmath46 of 2012 .",
    "we obtain very high values : 91.2% for the matrices of contact durations , 92.4% for the matrices giving the number of contacts , and 97.9% for the matrices of the densities of edges between classes .",
    "the overall contact structures are therefore very robust from one year to the next , despite the different populations involved . in order to investigate in more detail these similarities between years ,",
    "we show in figure [ fig : timeline_years ] the temporal evolutions of the number of contacts registered in one - hour time windows in both cases .",
    "the number of contacts vary strongly within each day in both years , but the temporal patterns are very similar from one day to another in both cases , with daily rhythms due to class and lunch breaks . in both years",
    "however , the contacts of each individual in different days are not completely the same , as shown above in figure [ fig : deg_vs_time ] and through the measure of the cosine similarities of neighborhoods in different daily aggregated networks .",
    "interestingly , the distributions and average values of these cosine similarities take similar values in both years : for instance , the average values of the cosine similarities of individual neighborhoods in different days vary from 0.35 to 0.43 in the 2011 data set and from 0.29 to 0.44 in the 2012 data set .",
    "the rates of renewal of the contact neighborhood of each individual is thus as well a robust property of these data sets .",
    "in this article , we have presented an analysis of two high - resolution contact data sets collected in a french high school using wearable sensors , respectively for three classes during four school days in december 2011 and for five classes during seven school days in november 2012 .",
    "several important points emerge from our analysis .",
    "the aggregated network of contacts has small diameter and high clustering , with a strong community structure determined by the students classes , similarly to what was observed in a primary school @xcite .",
    "the degree distribution is homogeneous , meaning that the number of distinct persons with whom an individual has contacts does not show large fluctuations . on the contrary , and",
    "as observed in other contexts ranging from primary school to conferences or hospitals @xcite , large variations occur in the durations of single contact events as well as in the cumulated durations of the contacts between two individuals : the distribution of these quantities are heavy - tailed and no specific duration timescale can be identified .",
    "the contact matrices quantifying the number or duration of contacts between different classes show a clear structure , with much larger values on the diagonal ( corresponding to contacts within each class ) and an additional substructure of two groups of respectively two and three classes .",
    "while the large values of the number of contacts inside each class is expected due to the school structure and schedule , the off - diagonal structure reflects patterns which are more due to either spatial arrangements of classes inside the high school or to similarities in the dominant subjects studied by the students .",
    "overall , and as could be expected , the contact patterns in such an environment would not be correctly represented by a homogeneous mixing approximation . as no strong gender homophily is observed ( contrarily to the case of a primary school @xcite ) , a further subdivision of each class in groups according to gender",
    "does not seem however a necessary step in modeling processes : the division of the population at the level of classes appears as an adequate level of description , for instance when designing a model of contacts to evaluate the outcome of a spreading process in this population @xcite .    in the context of the design of data - driven realistic models for human contacts , or for the information of models of spreading processes , the robustness of contact patterns at different timescales represents also a crucial information .",
    "strikingly , the properties of the temporally resolved contact patterns are extremely robust from one day to the next in several aspects : in terms of the variation of the contact numbers with time along the course of each day , in terms of statistical distributions of contact durations , and in terms of the contact matrices , which have a very high similarity from one day to another .",
    "interestingly , this similarity between contact patterns in the high school remains very strong when comparing data collected in two different years , with different students populations .",
    "the contact patterns of each individual are however not the same in different days , and we give an estimation of the renewal of contacts by measuring the average cosine similarity of their neighborhoods in daily contact networks .",
    "the obtained values show that the contacts of a random individual vary substantially in different days , but much less than in null models in which contacts are renewed at random from one day to the next . moreover , the observed values of these similarities are similar in the two data sets corresponding to two different years , and can thus be considered as a feature to be included in realistic models of human contacts in such an environment .",
    "comparison of data collected in different environments of similar nature is also important , in particular to highlight similar patterns in specific structures and therefore to inform mathematical models .",
    "few studies using wearable sensors , and giving access to high - resolution data on contacts between individuals , are however available .",
    "we compare in figure [ fig : salathe ] some statistical properties of the data sets presented here with the data set made public by salath et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite , which gives the durations of close proximity events between 788 high school students during a typical day at school .",
    "given the different definitions of contact in the two studies , the average number of distinct neighbors in the aggregated contact networks are different : 24.7 for the present study and 299.5 for @xcite .",
    "once rescaled however , the distributions of degrees of the aggregated networks are similarly short - tailed , albeit with slightly different functional shapes .",
    "most importantly , the distributions of the contact durations and of the edge weights in the contact networks are very similar in the two studies , with similar slopes and heavy - tails .",
    "data sets such as the ones presented here are of interest in various fields , including in social sciences in order to better understand and model human behavior and interactions in different contexts , and in epidemiology in order to inform models describing the spread of infectious diseases . in this respect ,",
    "data gathering in contexts such as schools , where many contacts are expected between students , favoring the possible spread of diseases among them and successively in the community , are particularly invaluable .",
    "such data may also help devise and evaluate data - driven containment strategies .",
    "for instance , the fact that the contact matrices are highly structured , with most contacts occurring within classes and additional structures of 2 or three classes , as also in a primary school @xcite , indicates that containment strategies such as the closure of single classes or groups of classes when a disease outbreak is detected could represent viable alternatives to full school closures @xcite .",
    "the use of wearable sensors appears as an appealing method to measure contacts between individuals .",
    "it has both advantages and limitations with respect to more traditional approaches such as the use of survey or time - use data @xcite or the construction of synthetic populations from socio - demographic data @xcite , which have yielded important insights and allowed to inform large - scale epidemiological models .    on the one hand , surveys are costly and often have often a low response @xcite , and the precise formulation of the question might influence the answers .",
    "answers are also subject to memory biases , which are difficult to estimate @xcite but can be large @xcite .",
    "moreover , surveys often collect ego - networks on single days ( see however @xcite ) , and it is then difficult to estimate some properties of the contact networks known to be relevant for the spread of infectious diseases , such as the number of triangles and the fraction of repeated contacts from one day to the next @xcite . in contrast , the cost of the deployment of wearable sensors is nowadays affordable , they can be used during several consecutive days within a specific population , and they provide an objective definition of contact that does not rely on memory of individuals .    on the other hand , surveys yield large - scale data sets providing age - based contact matrices of crucial importance in parametrizing models of infectious diseases .",
    "notably , surveys can include a distinction between different types of contact , and in particular inform on the occurrence of physical contacts , which is known to be important in epidemiology @xcite , while wearable sensors do not yield such information .",
    "deployments of wearable sensors are moreover typically limited to relatively small - scale settings and specific contexts , and do not give information on contacts occurring between individuals participating to the measures and other individuals ( e.g. , here , students from non - participating classes ) .",
    "another potential issue concerns the possibility that individuals changed their behaviour because they were wearing badges and knew they were participating in a scientific measure .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to completely rule out this potential bias as an accurate check would require monitoring an independent data source for face - to - face contacts such as video , and because of scalability issues this would be feasible only for small control groups .",
    "the robustness of a series of statistical characteristics across contexts involving different types of participants @xcite tends in this respect to be reassuring .",
    "overall , the use of sensors appears as complementary to the use of surveys , in particular by providing information at a finer scale : they indicate how far schools , classes or workplaces are from being fully mixed , as the data give access to the density of the contact networks of each class and between classes ; they give reliable information with high temporal resolution on contact durations and on their statistical distributions , shown to be highly heterogeneous , an important property in the context of infectious disease transmissions . in this respect ,",
    "further data gathering efforts in different contexts are thus certainly of interest , in particular to further assess the robustness of our results and to compare data obtained in different contexts .",
    "furthermore , the combination of such data with other data sources such as surveys might represent an interesting further step .",
    "we are grateful to the sociopatterns collaboration  @xcite for providing access to the sociopatterns sensing platform that was used in collecting the contact data , and to c. cattuto for discussions .",
