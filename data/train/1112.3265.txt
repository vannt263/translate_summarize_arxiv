    "online social networks ( e.g. , facebook , google@xmath0 ) have become increasingly important resources for interacting with people , processing information and diffusing social influence . understanding and modeling the mechanisms by which these networks evolve are therefore fundamental issues and active areas of research .",
    "the classical _ link prediction problem _ @xcite has attracted particular interest . in this",
    "setting , we are given a snapshot of a social network at time @xmath1 and aim to predict links ( e.g. , friendships ) that will emerge in the network between @xmath1 and a later time @xmath2 . alternatively , we can imagine the setting in which some links existed at time @xmath1 but are missing at @xmath2 . in online social networks ,",
    "a change in privacy settings often leads to missing links , e.g. , a user on google@xmath0might decide to hide her family circle between time @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the missing link problem has important ramifications as missing links can alter estimates of network - level statistics  @xcite , and the ability to infer these missing links raises serious privacy concerns for social networks .",
    "since the same algorithms can be used to predict new links and missing links , we refer to these problems jointly as link prediction .",
    "another problem of increasing interest revolves around node attributes  @xcite .",
    "many real - world networks contain rich categorical node attributes , e.g. , users in google@xmath0have profiles with attributes including employer , school , occupation and places lived . in the _ attribute inference problem _ , we aim to populate attribute information for network nodes with missing or incomplete attribute data .",
    "this scenario often arises in practice when users in online social networks set their profiles to be publicly invisible or create an account without providing any attribute information .",
    "the growing interest in this problem is highlighted by the privacy implications associated with attribute inference as well as the importance of attribute information for applications including people search and collaborative filtering . in this work ,",
    "we simultaneously use network structure and node attribute information to improve performance of both the link prediction and the attribute inference problems , motivated by the observed interaction and homophily between network structure and node attributes .",
    "the principle of social influence @xcite , which states that users who are linked are likely to adopt similar attributes , suggests that network structure should inform attribute inference",
    ". other evidence of interaction @xcite shows that users with similar attributes , or in some cases antithetical attributes , are likely to link to one another , motivating the use of attribute information for link prediction .",
    "additionally , previous studies @xcite have empirically demonstrated those effects on real - world social networks , providing further support for considering both network structure and node attribute information when predicting links or inferring attributes .",
    "however , the algorithmic question of how to simultaneously incorporate these two sources of information remains largely unanswered .",
    "the relational learning  @xcite , matrix factorization and alignment  @xcite based approaches have been proposed to leverage attribute information for link prediction , but they suffer from scalability issues .",
    "more recently , backstrom and leskovec  @xcite presented a supervised random walk ( srw ) algorithm for link prediction that combines network structure and edge attribute information , but this approach does not fully leverage node attribute information as it only incorporates node information for neighboring nodes .",
    "for instance , srw can not take advantage of the common node attribute san francisco of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ figure : san ] since there is no edge between them .",
    "yin et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the use of _ social - attribute network _",
    "( san ) to gracefully integrate network structure and node attributes in a scalable way .",
    "they focused on generalizing random walk with restart ( rwwr ) algorithm to the san model to predict links as well as infer node attributes . in this paper , we generalize several leading supervised and unsupervised link prediction algorithms @xcite to the san model to both predict links and infer missing attributes .",
    "we evaluate these algorithms on a novel , large - scale google@xmath0dataset , and demonstrate performance improvement for each of them .",
    "moreover , we make the novel observation that inferring attributes could help predict links , i.e. , link prediction accuracy is further improved by first inferring missing node attributes .",
    "in our problem setting , we use an undirected graph @xmath5 to represent a social network , where edges in @xmath6 represent interactions between the latexmath:[$n =    have categorical attributes for nodes . for instance , in the google@xmath0social network , nodes are users , edges represent friendship ( or some other relationship ) between users , and node attributes are derived from user profile information and include fields such as employer , school , and hometown . in this work",
    "we restrict our focus to categorical variables , though in principle other types of variables , e.g. , live chats , email messages , real - valued variables , etc . , could be clustered into categorical variables via vector quantization , or directly discretized to categorical variables .",
    "we use a binary representation for each categorical attribute .",
    "for example , various employers ( e.g. , google , intel and yahoo ) and various schools ( e.g. , berkeley , stanford and yale ) are each treated as separate binary attributes . hence , for a specific social network , the number of distinct attributes @xmath8 is finite ( though @xmath8 could be large ) .",
    "attributes of a node @xmath9 are then represented as a @xmath8-dimensional trinary column vector @xmath10 with the @xmath11 entry equal to @xmath12 when @xmath9 has the @xmath11 attribute ( _ positive attribute _ ) , @xmath13 when @xmath9 does not have it ( _ negative attribute _ ) and @xmath14 when it is unknown whether or not @xmath9 has it ( _ missing attribute _ ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath15 $ ] the attribute matrix for all nodes .",
    "note that certain attributes ( e.g. female and male , age of 20 and 30 ) are mutually exclusive .",
    "let @xmath16 be the set of all pairs of mutually exclusive attributes .",
    "this set constrains the attribute matrix @xmath17 so that no column contains a @xmath12 for two mutually exclusive attributes .",
    "we define the link prediction problem as follows :    let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be snapshots of a social network at times @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then the link prediction problem involves using @xmath22 to predict the social network structure @xmath23 . when @xmath24 , new links are predicted . when @xmath25 , missing links are predicted .    in this paper",
    ", we work with three snapshots of the google@xmath0network crawled at three successive times , denoted @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "to predict new links , we use various algorithms to solve the link prediction problem with @xmath29 and @xmath30 and first learn any required hyperparameters by performing grid search on the link prediction problem with @xmath31 and @xmath32 . similarly , to predict missing links , we solve the link prediction problem with @xmath29 and @xmath33 and learn hyperparameters via grid search with @xmath34 and @xmath32 .    for",
    "any given snapshot , several entries of @xmath17 will be zero , corresponding to missing attributes . the attribute inference problem , which involves only a single snapshot of the network , is defined as follows :    let @xmath35 be a snapshot of a social network .",
    "then the attribute inference problem is to infer whether each zero entry of @xmath17 corresponds to a positive or negative attribute , subject to the constraints listed in @xmath16 .",
    "our goal is to design scalable algorithms leveraging both network structure and rich node attributes to address these problems for real - world large - scale networks .",
    "_ social - attribute network _",
    "was first proposed by yin et al .",
    "@xcite to predict links and infer attributes",
    ". however , their original model did nt consider negative and mutually exclusive attributes . in this section ,",
    "we review this model and extend it to incorporate negative and mutex attributes .    given a social network @xmath36 with @xmath8 distinct categorical attributes , an attribute matrix @xmath17 and mutex attributes set @xmath16 , we create an augmented network by adding @xmath8 additional nodes to @xmath36 , with each additional node corresponding to an attribute . for each node @xmath9 in @xmath36 with positive or negative attribute @xmath37",
    ", we create an undirected link between @xmath9 and @xmath37 in the augmented network . for each mutually exclusive attribute pair @xmath38",
    ", we create an undirected link between @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "this augmented network is called the _ social - attribute network _ ( san ) since it includes the original social network interactions , relations between nodes and their attributes and mutex links between attributes .    nodes in the san model corresponding to nodes in @xmath36 are called _ social nodes _ , and nodes representing attributes are called _",
    "attribute nodes_. links between social nodes are called _ social links _ , and links between social nodes and attribute nodes are called _",
    "attribute links_. attribute link @xmath40 is a _ positive attribute link _ if @xmath37 is a positive attribute of node @xmath9 , and it is a _ negative attribute link _ otherwise .",
    "links between mutually exclusive attribute nodes are called _",
    "mutex links_. intuitively , the san model explicitly describes the sharing of attributes across social nodes as well as the mutual exclusion between attributes , as illustrated in the sample san model of fig .",
    "[ figure : san ] .",
    "moreover , with the san model , the link prediction problem reduces to predicting social links and the attribute inference problem involves predicting attribute links .",
    "we also place weights on the various nodes and edges in the san model .",
    "these node and edge weights describe the relative importance of individual nodes or relationships across nodes and can also be used in a global fashion to balance the influence of social nodes versus attribute nodes and social links versus attribute links .",
    "we use @xmath41 and @xmath42 to denote the weight of node @xmath9 and the weight of link @xmath43 , respectively . additionally , for a given social or attribute node @xmath9 in the san model , we denote by @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively the set of _ all neighbors _ and the set of _ social neighbors _ connected to @xmath9 via social links or positive attribute links .",
    "we define @xmath46 and @xmath47 in a similar fashion .",
    "this terminology will prove useful when we describe our generalization of leading link prediction algorithms to the san model in the next section .",
    "the fact that no social node can be linked to multiple mutex attributes is encoded in the _ mutex property _",
    ", i.e. , there is no triangle consisting of a mutex link and two positive attribute links in any social - attribute network , which enforces a set of constraints for all attribute inference algorithms .    in this work ,",
    "we focus primarily on node attributes . however , we note that the san model can be naturally extended to incorporate _",
    "edge attributes_. indeed , we can use a function ( e.g. , the logistic function ) to map a given set of attributes for each edge ( e.g. , edge age ) into the real - valued edge weights of the san model .",
    "the attributes - to - weight mapping function can be learned using an approach similar to the one proposed by backstrom and leskovec  @xcite .",
    "link prediction algorithms typically compute a probabilistic score for each candidate link and subsequently rank these scores and choose the largest ones ( up to some threshold ) as putative new or missing links . in the following ,",
    "we extend both unsupervised and supervised algorithms to the san model .",
    "furthermore , we note that when predicting attribute links , the san model features a post - processing step whereby we change the lowest ranked putative positive links violating the mutex property to negative links .",
    "liben - nowell and kleinberg @xcite provide a comprehensive survey of unsupervised link prediction algorithms for social networks .",
    "these algorithms can be roughly divided into two categories : local - neighborhood - based algorithms and global - structure - based algorithms . in principle , all of the algorithms discussed in @xcite can be generalized for the san model . in this work we focus on representative algorithms from both categories and we describe below how to generalize them to the san model to predict both social links and attribute links .",
    "we add the suffix ` -san ' to each algorithm name to indicate its generalization to the san model . in our presentation of the unsupervised algorithms ,",
    "we only consider positive attribute links , though many of these algorithms can be extended to signed networks @xcite . + * common neighbor ( cn - san ) * is a local algorithm that computes a score for a candidate social or attribute link @xmath43 as the sum of weights of @xmath9 and @xmath48 s common neighbors , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "conventional cn only considers common social neighbors .",
    "+ * adamic - adar ( aa - san ) * is also a local algorithm . for a candidate social link @xmath43",
    "the aa - san score is @xmath50 conventional aa , initially proposed in  @xcite to predict friendships on the web and subsequently adapted by @xcite to predict links in social networks , only considers common social neighbors .",
    "aa - san weights the importance of a common neighbor proportional to the inverse of the log of social degree .",
    "intuitively , we want to downweight the importance of neighbors that are either i ) social nodes that are social hubs or ii ) attribute nodes corresponding to attributes that are widespread across social nodes .",
    "since in both cases this weight depends on the social degree of a neighbor , the aa - san weight is derived based on social degree , rather than total degree .",
    "in contrast , for a candidate attribute link @xmath40 , the attribute degree of a common neighbor does influence the importance of the neighbor . for instance , consider two social nodes with the same social degree that are both common neighbors of nodes @xmath9 and @xmath37 . if the first of these social nodes has only two attribute neighbors while the second has @xmath51 attribute neighbors , the importance of the former social node should be greater with respect to the candidate attribute link .",
    "thus , aa - san computes the score for candidate attribute link @xmath40 as @xmath52    * low - rank approximation ( lra - san ) * takes advantage of global structure , in contrast to cn - san and aa - san .",
    "denote @xmath53 as the @xmath54 weighted social adjacency matrix where the @xmath55 entry of @xmath53 is @xmath42 if @xmath43 is a social link and zero otherwise .",
    "similarly , let @xmath56 be the @xmath57 weighted attribute adjacency matrix where the @xmath58 entry of @xmath56 is @xmath59 if @xmath40 is a positive attribute link and zero otherwise .",
    "we then obtain the weighted adjacency matrix @xmath60 for the san model by concatenating @xmath53 and @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "the lra - san method assumes that a small number of latent factors ( approximately ) describe the social and attribute link strengths within @xmath60 and attempts to extract these factors via low - rank approximation of @xmath60 , denoted by @xmath62 .",
    "the lra - san score for a candidate social or attribute link @xmath63 is then simply @xmath64 , or the @xmath65 entry of @xmath62 .",
    "lra - san can be computed efficiently via truncated singular value decomposition ( svd ) . +",
    "* cn + low - rank approximation ( cn+lra - san ) * is a mixture of local and global methods , as it first performs cn - san using a san model and then performs low - rank approximation on the resulting score matrix . after performing cn - san ,",

    "by virtue of the cn - san algorithm , note that @xmath66 includes attribute information and @xmath67 includes social interactions .",

    "+ * random walk with restart ( rwwr - san ) *  @xcite is a global algorithm . in the san model ,",
    "a random walk with restart  @xcite starting from @xmath9 recursively walks to one of its neighbors @xmath1 with probability proportional to the link weight @xmath73 and returns to @xmath9 with a fixed restart probability @xmath74 .",
    "the probability @xmath75 is the stationary probability of node @xmath48 in a random walk with restart initiated at @xmath9 . in general , @xmath76 . for a candidate social link @xmath43",
    ", we compute @xmath75 and @xmath77 and let @xmath78 .",

    "link prediction can be cast as a binary classification problem , in which we first construct features for links , and then use a classifier such as svms or logistic regression .",

    "we explored 4 feature combinations : i ) slp - i uses only topological features @xmath80 computed from social networks ; ii ) slp - ii uses topological features @xmath80 as well as an aggregate feature , i.e. , the number of common attributes of the two endpoints of a link ; iii ) slp - san - iii uses topological features @xmath81 ; and iv ) slp - san - vi uses topological features @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "we first infer the top attributes for users without any observed attributes .",
    "we then update the san model to include these predicted attributes and perform link prediction on the updated san model .",
    "this process can be performed for several iterations .",
    "google launched its new social network service named google@xmath0  in early july 2011 .",
    "we crawled three snapshots of the google@xmath0  social network and their users profiles on july 19 , august 6 and september 19 in 2011 .",
    "they are denoted as jul , aug and sep , respectively .",
    "we then pre - processed the data before conducting link prediction and attribute inference experiments . + * preprocessing social networks * in google@xmath0 , users divide their social connections into circles , such as a family circle and a friends circle .",
    "if user @xmath9 is in @xmath48 s circle , then there is a directed edge @xmath82 in the graph , and thus the google@xmath0dataset is a directed social graph .",
    "we converted this dataset into an undirected graph by only retaining edges @xmath43 if both directed edges @xmath43 and @xmath82 exist in the original graph .",
    "we chose to adopt this filtering step for two reasons : ( 1 ) bidirectional edges represent mutual friendships and hence represent a stronger type of relationship that is more likely to be useful when inferring users attributes from their friends attributes ( 2 ) we reduce the influence of spammers who add people into their circles without those people adding them back .",
    "spammers introduce fictitious directional edges into the social graph that adversely influence the performance of link prediction algorithms .",

    "google@xmath0  has predefined employer and school entities , although users can still fill in their own defined entities .",
    "due to users changing privacy settings , some profiles in jul are not found in aug and sep , so we use jul to construct our attribute vocabulary .",

    "we also found the corresponding social networks consisting of these nodes in snapshots aug and sep .",
    "social - attribute networks were then constructed with the chosen social networks and the attributes of the nodes . specifically , we chose @xmath84 to construct 6 social - attribute networks whose statistics are shown in table  [ table : net_stat ] .",
    "each social - attribute network is named by concatenating the snapshot name and the attribute - frequency threshold .",

    "hence , computing auc using all non - existing links in large - scale networks is typically computationally infeasible .",
    "moreover , the majority of new links in typical online social networks close triangles @xcite , i.e. , are hop-2 links . for instance , we find that @xmath91 of the newly added links in google+ are hop-2 links .",

    "local algorithms applied to the original social network are unable to predict hop-2 links in the second category .",

    "finally , we show that by combining attribute inference and link prediction in an iterative fashion , we achieve even greater accuracy on the link prediction task .      to demonstrate the benefits of combining node attributes and network structure , we run the san - based link prediction algorithms described in section  [ sec : algorithms ] both on the original social networks and on the corresponding social - attribute networks ( recall that the san - based unsupervised algorithms reduce to standard unsupervised link prediction algorithms when working solely with the original social networks ) .",
    "+ * predicting new links * table [ table : link - pre ] shows the auc results of predicting new links for each of our datasets .",
    "we are able to draw a number of conclusions from these results .",
    "first , the san model improves every unsupervised learning algorithm on every dataset , save for lra - san on aug2-sep2 .",
    "second , table  [ table : link - pre - svm ] shows that attributes also improve supervised link prediction performance since slp - san - vi , slp - san - iii and slp - ii outperform slp - i .",
    "moreover , slp - san - vi , which adopts features extracted from both social networks and social - attribute networks , achieves the best performance , thus demonstrating the power of the san model .",
    "third , comparing rwwr - san in table  [ table : link - pre-4-any - hop ] and srw in table  [ table : link - pre - svm ] , we observe that the san model is better than srw at leveraging node attributes since rwwr - san with attributes outperforms srw .",
    "this result is not surprising given that srw is designed for edge attributes and when transforming node attributes to edge attributes , we lose some information .",
    "for instance , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure : san ] , nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 share the attribute san francisco . when transforming node attributes to edge attributes , this common attribute information is lost since",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are not linked .",
    "[ figure : exp1-link - pre - roc-4 ] shows the roc curves of the cn+lra - san algorithm .",
    "we see that curve of cn+lra - san with attributes dominates that of cn+lra - san without attributes , demonstrating the power of the san model to effectively incorporate the additional predictive information of attributes .",
    "+    [ table : infer - link ]    * predicting missing links * missing links can be divided into two categories : 1 ) links whose two endpoints have some social links in the training dataset .",
    "2 ) links with at least one endpoint that has no social links in the training dataset .",
    "category 1 corresponds to the scenarios where users block users or users set a part of their friend lists ( e.g. family circles ) to be private .",
    "category 2 corresponds to the scenario in which users hide their entire friend lists .",
    "note that all hop-2 missing links belong to category 1 .",
    "in addition to performing experiments to show that the san model improves missing link prediction , we also perform experiments to explore which category of missing links is easier to predict .",
    "table [ table : infer - link ] shows the results of predicting missing links on various datasets . as in the new - link prediction setting , the performance of every algorithm is improved by the san model , except for lra - san on aug4-jul4 and rwwr - san on aug4-jul4 for hop-2 missing links .",
    "when comparing tables  [ table : infer - missing - link-4-any - hop ] and  [ table : infer - missing - link-4-any - hop-1 ] or tables  [ table : infer - missing - link - svm ] and  [ table : infer - missing - link - svm-1 ] , we conclude that the missing links in category 2 are harder to predict than those in category 1 .",
    "rwwr - san without attributes performs poorly when predicting any - hop missing links in both categories ( as indicated by the entry with @xmath92 in table  [ table : infer - missing - link-4-any - hop ] ) .",
    "this poor performance is due to the fact that rwwr - san without attributes assigns zero scores for all the missing links in category 2 ( positive examples ) and positive scores for most non - existing links ( negative examples ) , making many negative examples rank higher than positive examples and resulting in a very low auc .      in this section ,",
    "we focus on inferring attributes using the san model . in our next set of experiments in section [ sec : iterate ] , we use the results of these attribute inference algorithms to further improve link prediction , and the results of this iterative approach further validate the performance of the san model for attribute inference . since the first step of iterative approach of section [ sec : iterate ] involves inferring the top attributes for each node , we employ an additional performance metric called pre@@xmath93 in our attribute inference experiments . compared to auc",
    ", pre@@xmath93 better captures the quality of the top attribute predictions for each user .",
    "specifically , for each sampled user , the top-@xmath93 predicted attributes are selected , and ( unnormalized ) pre@@xmath93 is then defined as the number of positive attributes selected divided by the number of sampled users .",
    "we address score ties in the manner described in  @xcite .",
    "since most google@xmath0  users have a small number of attributes , we set @xmath94 in our experiments .    when evaluating algorithms for the inference of missing attributes , we require ground truth data .",
    "in general , ground truth for node attributes is difficult to obtain since it is often not possible to distinguish between negative and missing attributes .",
    "however , for most users the number of attributes is quite small , and so we assume that users with many positive attributes have no missing attributes . hence , we evaluate attribute inference on users that have at least 4 specified attributes , i.e. , we work with users in sep4 and assume that each attribute link in sep4 is either positive or negative .    in our experiment , we sample 10% of the users in sep4 uniformly at random , remove their attribute links from sep4 , and evaluate the accuracy with which we can infer these users attributes .",
    "all removed positive attribute links are viewed as positive examples , while all the negative attribute links of the sampled users are treated as negative examples .",
    "we run a variety of algorithms for attribute inference , and for each algorithm we average the results over 10 random trials . as noted above",
    ", we evaluate the performance of attribute inference using both auc and pre@@xmath93 .    for the low - rank approximation based algorithms ,",
    "i.e. , lra - san , cn+lra - san and aa+lra - san , we report results using two different ranks , 100 and 1000 , and indicate which was used by the number following the algorithm name in fig .",
    "[ figure : infer - attri ] .",
    "we choose these two small ranks for computational reasons and also based on the fact that low - rank approximation methods assume that a small number of latent factors ( approximately ) describe the social - attribute networks . for rwwr - san",
    ", we set the restart probability @xmath74 to be 0.7 .",
    "[ figure : infer - attri ] shows the attribute inference results for various algorithms .",
    "several interesting observations can be made from this figure .",
    "first , under both metrics , all san - based algorithms perform better than baseline , save lra100-san and lra1000-san under pre@2,3,4 metric , which indicates that the san model is good at leveraging network structure to infer missing attributes .",
    "second , we find that auc and pre@@xmath93 provide inconsistent conclusions about relative algorithm performance .",
    "for instance , the mean auc values suggest that sai - san beats all other algorithms .",
    "however , several unsupervised algorithms outperform sai - san with respect to pre@2,3,4 .",
    "the inconsistencies between the two metrics are expected since auc is a global measurement while pre@@xmath93 is a local one .",
    "our sai - san algorithm dominates link under both auc and pre@2,3,4 metrics , thus demonstrating the power of mapping attribute inference to link prediction with the san model .",
    "section  [ sec : link - prediction ] demonstrated that knowledge of a user s attributes can lead to significant improvements in link prediction .",
    "however , in real - world social networks like google+ , the vast majority of user attributes are missing ( see fig .",
    "[ figure : node - attri ] ) . to increase the realized benefits of social - attribute networks with few attributes , we propose first inferring missing attributes for each user whose",
    "attributes are missing and then performing link prediction on the inferred social - attribute networks .",
    "recall that sai - san achieves the best auc , rwwr - san achieves the best pre@@xmath93 in inferring attributes ( see fig .  [",
    "figure : infer - attri ] ) and aa - san achieves comparable pre@@xmath93 results while being more scalable . thus , in the following experiments , we use aa - san to first infer the top-@xmath93 missing attributes for users , and subsequently perform link prediction using various methods .    in our experiments ,",
    "when we are working on the pair _ train - test _ , we sample 10% of the users of _ train _ uniformly at random and remove their attributes .",
    "we then run three variants of link prediction algorithms : i ) without attributes , ii ) with only the remaining attributes , and iii ) with the remaining attributes along with the inferred attributes .",
    "the top-4 attributes are inferred for each sampled user by aa - san .",
    "we report the results averaged over 10 trials .",
    "the hyperparameters of the global algorithms are the same as those in ( section [ sec : link - prediction ] ) , which are learned from the corresponding train - validation pair .",
    "table [ table : iter - link - pre ] shows the results of first inferring attributes and then predicting new links on the aug4-sep4 train - test pair .",
    "table  [ table : iter - infer - missing - link ] shows the results of first inferring attributes and then predicting missing links on the aug4-jul4 train - test pair .",
    "we see that the inferred attributes improve the performance of all algorithms except lra - san on predicting missing links , which is unable to make use of attributes as demonstrated earlier in table  [ table : infer - missing - link-4 ] .",
    "the aucs obtained with inferred attributes for all other algorithms are very close to those obtained with all positive attributes as shown in table [ table : link - pre-4 ] .",
    "this further demonstrates that aa - san is an effective algorithm for attribute inference .",
    "a wide range of link prediction methods have been developed .",

    "lichtenwalter et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the propflow algorithm which is similar to rwwr but more localized .",
    "however , none of these approaches leverage node attribute information .",
    "link prediction methods leveraging attribute information first appear in the relational learning community @xcite .",
    "however , these approaches suffer from scalability issues .",
    "for instance , the largest network tested in  @xcite has about @xmath95 nodes . recently ,",
    "backstrom and leskovec @xcite proposed the supervised random walk ( srw ) algorithm to leverage edge attributes .",
    "however , srw does not handle the scenario in which two nodes share common attributes ( e.g. nodes @xmath3 and @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ figure : san ] ) , but no edge already exists between them .",
    "mapping link prediction to a classification problem  @xcite is another way to incorporate attributes .",
    "we have shown that classifiers using features extracted from the san model perform very well .",
    "yang et al .",
    "@xcite proposed to jointly predict links and propagate node interests ( e.g. , music interest ) .",
    "their algorithm relies on the assumption that each node interest has a set of explicit attributes . as a result",
    ", their algorithm can not be applied to our scenario in which it s hard ( if possible ) to extract explicit attributes for our node attributes .",
    "previous works in @xcite aim at inferring node attributes ( e.g. , ethnicity and political orientation ) using supervised learning methods with features extracted from user names and user - generated texts .",
    "zheleva and getoor  @xcite map attribute inference to a relational classification problem .",
    "they find that methods using group information achieve good results .",
    "these approaches are complementary to ours since they use additional information apart from network structure and node attributes . in this paper",
    ", we transform the attribute inference problem into a link prediction problem with the san model .",
    "therefore , any link prediction algorithm can be used to infer missing attributes .",
    "more importantly , we demonstrate that attribute inference can in turn help link prediction with the san model .",
    "we comprehensively evaluate the _ social - attribute network _ ( san ) model proposed in  @xcite in terms of link prediction and attribute inference . more specifically",

    "moreover , we demonstrate a further improvement of link prediction accuracy by using the san model in an iterative fashion , first to infer missing attributes and subsequently to predict links .",
    "interesting avenues for future research include devising an iterative algorithm that alternates between attribute and link prediction , learning node and edge weights in the san model , and incorporating edge attributes , negative node attributes and mutex edges into large - scale experiments .",
