    "although clasical novae occur rather frequently in our galaxy ( some tens of events per year ) , they are not expected to contribute greatly to the chemical enrichment of the galaxy because they eject relatively small masses of nuclear - processed material .",
    "the rare cno nuclei @xmath2c , @xmath3n and @xmath4o are exceptions , and so is the light isotope @xmath1li , which is the topic of the present study ( hernanz & jos 2000 ) .",
    "about 10% of the present galactic abundance of @xmath1li may have come from novae , which are one of the several sources ( mainly cosmic ray spallation and neutrino spallation in supernovae : cass , vangioni - flam & audouze 2001 ) that raise the @xmath1li abundance above the cosmologically - interesting value left by big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "nova nucleosynthesis of @xmath1li is also of interest in that the @xmath1li is produced as unstable @xmath1be by the reaction @xmath5he(@xmath6,@xmath0)@xmath1be , where @xmath5he is another big bang isotope whose subsequent evolution must be accounted for .",
    "the @xmath7-decay of @xmath1be with half - life 53.28 d is accompanied in 10.5% of cases by emission of a @xmath0-ray of energy 478 kev that potentially provides a direct measurement of the nova contribution if it can be detected .",
    "monitoring of the @xmath0-ray sky for novae is important because many events are never detected ( @xmath8 out of several dozen per year are discovered , often by amateur astronomers : harris et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 , hereafter papers i and ii ) , raising the possibility that original discoveries of optically - undetected novae may be made by their @xmath0-ray emission alone .",
    "this requires experiments with broad fields of view carried on space platforms over periods of the order of years .",
    "data from four such experiments have been analyzed with this purpose in view : the gamma ray spectrometer on the _ solar maximum mission _",
    "( _ smm _ , 19801989 : see e.g. leising et al .",
    "1988 ) ; batse and comptel on the _ compton _ observatory ( 19912000 : hernanz et al . 2000 and iyudin et al .",
    "1995 , 2001 ) ; and the transient gamma ray spectrometer ( tgrs ) on board _ wind _ , from which we will present results from 19951997 in this paper .",
    "the properties of the tgrs detector , which we describe in  3 , are very suitable for monitoring line emission from novae .",
    "the detector has very good energy resolution , which enables doppler - shifted lines from cosmic sources to be distinguished from background lines at the rest energy ; we previously exploited this property in searches for the 511 kev positron annihilation line , which is blueshifted by a few kev in novae ( paper i , paper ii ) . in this paper",
    "we exploit another property of tgrs to search for the 478 kev line , namely the remarkable stability of the instrument s background @xmath0-ray line spectrum (  4 ) .",
    "our analysis relies to some extent on the expected properties of the @xmath0-ray line from the nova event .",
    "the most important factor in the nucleosynthesis is the composition of the white dwarf upon which the explosion occurs , since material is expected to have entered the burning layer by diffusion upward and to have altered its composition substantially from what was accreted .",
    "most common are expected to be degenerate co remnants of @xmath9 left by lower mass red giants .",
    "more massive objects up to the limiting stable mass @xmath10 probably have one composition .",
    "it is not clear where the transition in mass between co and one occurs , or whether indeed there is a range of overlap .",
    "although the general white dwarf mass distribution peaks around @xmath11 , the distribution of white dwarf masses in novae is skewed towards higher masses , because the frequency with which nova outbursts recur is a steeply rising function of mass . the one remnants and the more massive co objects @xmath12 are therefore over - represented . a ratio of 2:1 for the two subclasses co : one is often assumed .",
    "abundance analyses are not available for most novae .",
    "properties may be deduced ( with great uncertainty ) from the correlations of white dwarf subclass with other observables .",
    "it appears that explosions on co white dwarfs are less energetic .",
    "the ejected masses are of order @xmath13 for both subclasses , but co novae have lower expansion velocities",
    "@xmath14 km s@xmath15 ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "one of the individual novae that we will consider , the one type cp cru , had a velocity of 2000 km s@xmath15 ( della valle 1996 ) .",
    "theoretical models predict that co novae are the strongest sources of the 478 kev @xmath0-ray line ( gomz - gomar et al .",
    "1998 , hernanz & jos 2000 ) since they may produce about @xmath16 of @xmath1be per event .",
    "however , predictions of the @xmath1be mass fraction produced vary considerably ( see e.g. starrfield et al .",
    "2000a , hix et al .",
    "2000 , and hernanz & jos 2000 ) .",
    "further uncertainty is added by the failure ( in general ) of models to reproduce the full @xmath13 of ejecta , falling short by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "the ejecta velocities are also usually underestimated .",
    "distance estimates for novae are highly uncertain .",
    "an empirical relation exists between rate of decline and absolute visual magnitude : @xmath17 ( warner 1995 ) , where @xmath18 , the speed class , is the time taken for @xmath19 to increase by 2 from discovery .",
    "following the explosion in and ejections by thermonuclear runaway , the remaining surface layers undergo hydrostatic h burning on a longer time - scale @xmath20 yr ( shore , starrfield , & sonneborn 1996 ) and a convective envelope developes . during this time",
    "the bolometric luminosity is thought to remain constant at the eddington value @xmath21 ( warner 1995 ) , but the peak of the emission moves from the optical to the uv as expansion reveals hotter underlying layers .",
    "this leads to a second method of estimating distance that has sometimes been used ( e.g. stickland et al .",
    "1981 , evans et al . 1990 ) .",
    "let it be assumed that at visual maximum almost all the flux is at visual wavelengths [ as stickland et al .",
    "found for v1668 cyg ( 1978 ) ] .",
    "the absolute visual magnitude is then known from the eddington formula @xmath22 erg s@xmath15 , where @xmath23 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath24 the white dwarf mass in @xmath25 ; the distance follows from a comparison of apparent and absolute visual magnitudes .",
    "post - outburst behavior raises further questions about @xmath1be observability , which depends on the time - scale on which the expanding envelope becomes transparent to the @xmath0-ray line ; it obviously must be well within the 53 d half - life of @xmath1be if the line is to be seen.be in a low - velocity , late - time wind of which part is accelerated by a drag force due to the companion when a common envelope developes between primary and secondary ( livio et al .",
    "it was applied to @xmath0-ray line emission in novae v838 her ( starrfield et al . 1992 , 1993 ) and v1974 cyg ( starrfield et al . 1993 ) .",
    "models of this type will not become transparent to @xmath0-rays for @xmath26 d or two half - lives , severely depleting the detectable @xmath1be .",
    "] we assume that this is the case , following gomz - gomar et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who predict @xmath0-ray transparency after 513 days , depending on the mass and composition of the model .",
    "these models also predict large yields of @xmath1be and 478 kev line fluxes .",
    "our measurements can therefore be regarded as an approach to testing these `` optimistic '' models .    during 19951997 five novae",
    "were discovered in the southern hemisphere .",
    "they are listed in table 1 , with composition information where available , and distance estimates from the two empirical methods described above .",
    "there are obvious sources of uncertainty in the distance measurements , notably the time of visual maximum ( before discovery ) and , in the case of the @xmath27 method , possible neglect of a bolometric correction and super - eddington velocities in some novae ( schwarz 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , there is a single reliable distance measurement ( 3180 pc for cp cru from expansion parallax : downes & duerbeck 2000 ) .",
    "relative to paper i ( see previous footnote ) there are a few changes in table 1 due to our improved knowledge of the times of visual maxima , thanks to diligent searches of the records of southern hemisphere amateurs ( f. bateson & a. jones , private communication ) .",
    "in space - based @xmath0-ray astronomy the signal from any cosmic source is usually completely dominated by intense ambient background radiation arising from bombardment by the all - pervasive energetic cosmic ray particles , and by the ensuing secondary radiations such as @xmath7-decays .",
    "the central problem that all experiments must face is therefore how to subtract away this huge background ( typically @xmath28 of count rate ) .    in general",
    ", the signal has to be modulated .",
    "methods include pointing on and off source rapidly ( as with cgro/_osse _ , johnson et al .",
    "1993 ) , modulation in time by a periodic occulter ( e.g. an opaque aperture stop , or the spinning spacecraft body like _ heao-3 _ : mahoney et al .",
    "1982 ) , or even earth ( cgro/_batse _ : ling et al .",
    "2000 ) , or modulation in space by a coded mask illuminating a segmented detector plane ( to be used by _",
    "integral_/spi : vedrenne et al .",
    "it is important to note that our work with tgrs used two distinct methods of background subtraction .",
    "one is a mechanical occulter (  5 ) , but the other is unique to tgrs  unlike any other experiment tgrs can model its background lines and their temporal behavior accurately enough to perform a usable background subtraction (  4 ) .",
    "the two methods of background subtraction yield results for different `` samples '' of novae .",
    "occultation measures the averaged collective @xmath1be emission from the general direction of the gc .",
    "background modeling ought to detect sudden increases in an otherwise predictable background line time history , each the signature of an individual nova .",
    "we can search the whole time history , not just the times of the known novae in table 1 , in the hope of detecting nearby undiscovered events .",
    "the tgrs experiment is located on the south - facing surface of the rotating cylindrical _ wind _ body , which points permanently toward the southern ecliptic pole .",
    "the spectrometer , a radiatively cooled 35 @xmath29 n - type ge crystal sensitive to energies between 20 kev8 mev , is kept at its operating temperature 85 k by a passive radiative cooler constructed mainly of be and mg .",
    "apart from 30 mm of be / cu alloy that absorbs solar x - rays , it is unshielded , so that in normal ( non - burst ) operation background spectra are accumulated continuously from the entire southern ecliptic hemisphere . a 1 cm thick pb occulter attached to the _ wind _ body exploits the 3 s rotational period in order to modulate the signal from part of the sky .",
    "the occulter subtends @xmath30 along the ecliptic plane , rather than exactly the plane of the ecliptic , which would be @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 offset was designed to optimize modulation of the gc . ]",
    "as seen from the detector , the width of the band thereby occulted being @xmath32 fwhm at around 500 kev .",
    "owens et al .",
    "( 1995 ) reported the results of extensive monte carlo simulations of the instrument response as a function of energy and zenith angle .",
    "the actual cross section 35 @xmath29 is customarily reduced to an `` effective '' area by factoring in the efficiency of detection at a given energy and angle .",
    "further , the frequent cases where photon energy is only partly lost in the detector can not be used in the present analysis , since the counts appear in a smooth quasi - continuum at energies below the line energy , and no one count can be unambiguously associated with a weak line like that at 478 kev .",
    "our analysis therefore only uses photons which undergo full energy loss ( where in any case the ge response as a function of energy loss is maximal ) , i.e. which appear in the channel(s ) at the nominal line energy and are referred to as the `` photopeak '' . in these terms , the photopeak effective area of the tgrs detector is @xmath33 @xmath29 at 478 kev and zenith angle @xmath34 .",
    "it falls sharply with increasing energy but does not vary much with zenith angle ( owens et al .",
    "the instrument response was operationally verified by on - orbit comparisons of @xmath0-ray burst spectra with those obtained by cgro/_batse _ ( seifert et al . 1998 ) and _ wind_/konus ( palmer et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the sharp energy resolution of the detector is critical for our analysis .",
    "scintillator detectors like _ smm_/grs and _ batse _ typically achieve @xmath35 kev resolution around 500 kev .",
    "any line at 478 kev is therefore blended with the positron annihilation line at 511 kev , which is much stronger in both background and background - subtracted spectra .",
    "the resolution of tgrs at this energy was nominally about 3 kev fwhm , which was achieved in the early months of the mission ( harris et al .",
    "1998 ) ; thereafter resolution degraded due to accumulated damage from cosmic ray impacts .",
    "the line profiles also became distorted , with marked tails on the low - energy wings .",
    "we limited the data analysis to the period before fall 1997 , after which the deterioration became marked ( kurczynski et al .",
    "the detector gain stability also deteriorated on this time - scale .",
    "although the gain shift was not difficult to monitor using the positions of known narrow background lines , the effect on the analysis of occulted data was serious (  5.1 ) .",
    "the tgrs background spectra were binned in 1 kev energy channels over the entire 20 kev  8 mev range in 24 minute intervals .",
    "the occulted spectra were accumulated in 128 angle bins covering each 3 s revolution of _",
    "telemetry constraints did not allow all of these occulted data to be returned in finely - resolved energy bins , however .",
    "data above 1  mev were discarded .",
    "four energy windows were defined to be 20150 kev , 150400 kev , 4001000 kev , and 479543 kev , with energy binnings of 2 , 4 , 8 and 1 kev respectively .",
    "the boundaries of the windows changed during the mission as a result of the gain shift .",
    "the unusual orbits followed by _",
    "wind _ since launch provide the key to the success of the tgrs background modeling .",
    "they have all been highly elliptical ( acua et al . 1995 ) , and tgrs has thus spent virtually the whole mission in interplanetary space , avoiding major sources of @xmath0-ray background radiation such as earth albedo @xmath0-rays and energetic trapped charged particles .",
    "the chief source of particle bombardment is the galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) flux .",
    "there have been very few interruptions in the data stream , generally caused by brief passages of the trapped radiation belts around perigee and by triggering of a special mode of data collection by solar flares and @xmath0-ray bursts .",
    "the live time in this data set covers about 90% of the analysis period ( paper ii ) .",
    "the resulting tgrs background lines may be strong , but they are stable enough for our purposes (  4 below ) .",
    "by contrast , experiments in low earth orbit are plagued by trapped radiation belt - induced radioactivity , generating background lines varying on a wide variety of @xmath7-decay time - scales , many of which never reach equilibrium , and can not be predicted on either long or short time - scales ( weidenspointner et al .",
    "our analyses of the tgrs background and occulted data sets used quite distinct methodologies that were designed to measure different quantities . here",
    "we focus on the background spectra . a background spectrum is composed of many narrow lines from radioactivity induced by gcr and secondary neutron impacts , superimposed on a continuum .",
    "the large mass of be close to the tgrs detector in the radiative cooler and sunshield (  3 ) gives rise to a strong line at exactly 478 kev from the interactions @xmath36be(@xmath37,@xmath38)@xmath1be and @xmath36be(@xmath39,@xmath40)@xmath1be ( naya et al .",
    "we measured the strength of this line in successive spectra from the years 19951997 . any sudden increment in the strength",
    "would correspond to the signal from a cosmic source of @xmath1be , and would be confirmed by a subsequent decline on a 53 d half - life .",
    "this analysis can not detect a dc level of 478 kev line emission .",
    "this method clearly relies on the underlying background 478 kev line being very stable , or at least varying in a simple and comprehensible way . as mentioned above , the predominant factor has been radioactivity induced by the gcr flux which varies slowly with the 11 yr solar activity cycle .",
    "solar magnetic modulation is expected to cause the flux to peak around solar activity minimum , which occurred about halfway through our 19951997 analysis period .",
    "we found evidence for this in the count rate for partial energy losses @xmath41 mev in the detector that is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( top ) .",
    "this is above the energy region characteristic of @xmath0-rays produced by nuclear interactions , so that the background must be due principally to gcr bombardment and the diffuse cosmic background , of which the former only is time - variable .",
    "the day - to - day variability of the @xmath41 mev rate ( top full line ) shows a very weak @xmath42 d period that is caused by the _ wind _",
    "orbit crossing the neutral current sheet in the interplanetary magnetic field ( which varies with the 28 d solar rotation ) .",
    "when integrated over the 53 d time - scale characteristic of nova signals , the count rate shows a modest , smooth variation ( histogram ) that follows the trends expected for the gcr flux when subject to solar modulation .",
    "this pattern of variability was confirmed by a large number of measurements of tgrs background line strengths performed for line identification purposes ( weidenspointner et al .",
    "many prompt de - excitation lines were identified that arise from electromagnetic decays of excited nuclear states on submicrosecond time - scales , and it is clear that the intensities of these lines must trace the incident gcr flux effectively instantaneously .",
    "these trends are also shown in fig . 1 ( full lines ) .",
    "the background spectra were summed in 53 d intervals . in each interval",
    "the energy range 460490 kev was fitted with a spectral model consisting of a power law and two lines .",
    "there is a strong line at 472.2 kev due to @xmath43na from spallation of structural al , and the 477.6 kev @xmath1be line from the radiative cooler .",
    "the @xmath43na line was slightly distorted by the low - energy tailing problem even before the fall of 1997 (  3.2 ) .",
    "it was therefore fitted by an asymmetric function @xmath44 for amplitudes @xmath45 , @xmath46 , line energy @xmath47 and width parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( phillips & marlow 1976 ) .",
    "the line at 478 kev was not fitted by this function , since other factors broaden it ( symmetrically ) to such an extent that the asymmetry is not significant .",
    "one such factor is intrinsic ; this line is measured to be somewhat broader than the instrument resolution due to blending with a weak line of @xmath50co .",
    "alternatively , folding its profile with a gaussian corresponding to 1000 km s@xmath15 ( typical for co novae :  2 ) has the same effect . a simple gaussian with this width was therefore included in the fit . a specimen of such a fit is shown in fig .",
    "the amplitude in terms of count rate was corrected for efficiency using the photopeak effective area as a function of energy and zenith angle (  3.2 ) .",
    "the zenith angles of the five known 19951997 novae were readily obtained ; in the general case ( searching for a flux increase when no nova was known to be present ) we assumed a zenith angle of @xmath51 , which is the average for the estimated distribution of southern novae ( hatano et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the time series of the line amplitudes fitted to the 478 kev line in the background spectra is shown in fig . 3 ( _ top _ ) .",
    "we fitted this time series with a model by which @xmath1be is created in the instrument by a time - dependent gcr flux , and decays with a half - life 53.28 d. the various curves in figure 1 suggest that a simple parametrization of the gcr flux would be a linear increase between 1995 january and solar minimum in 1996 june , followed by an abrupt change of slope",
    ". let the corresponding @xmath1be production rate at time @xmath52 be @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants and @xmath55 changes slope at solar minimum .",
    "the time - dependent @xmath1be abundance is then @xmath56~ + ~\\frac{c t}{\\lambda}~+~n(t=0)~\\exp{(-\\lambda t)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 d. we fitted the time series to this function ( which has 5 free parameters when account is taken of the discontinuity at solar minimum ) and searched for significant sudden flux increases over and above it .",
    "this was done by fitting an exponentially decaying function with decay constant @xmath58 to each residual data point and the following ones .",
    "the fit using eq .",
    "( 5 ) is shown in fig . 3 ( _ top _ ) , and the residuals in fig . 3 ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "3 ( _ top _ and _ bottom _ ) that the function ( 2 ) fitted the data very well , so the procedure of fitting the exponential decay could be applied without obvious systematic errors . the clear result in fig . 3 ( _ bottom _ )",
    "is that no flux increase followed by exponential decline was found to appear in the 478 kev line , either at the times of known southern hemisphere novae or at any other time .",
    "clearly no hitherto undiscovered novae were detected by @xmath0-ray line emission using this method .",
    "the @xmath59 upper flux limits for this general case , and for the five known novae , are given in table 2 .",
    "our analysis of the occulted data was designed to measure a quasi - steady , quasi - diffuse 478 kev @xmath0-ray line arising from the integrated emission of many novae that would have occurred towards the gc during the 53 d half - life of @xmath1be .",
    "the principle was suggested by leising ( 1988 ) , and was put into practice by harris , leising & share ( 1991 ) .",
    "our procedure was essentially identical to that which we previously employed to measure the diffuse positron annihilation spectrum from the gc ( harris et al .",
    "1998 ) . when the count rate in an energy channel is plotted as a function of angle along the ecliptic , those angle bins corresponding to the direction of a source show dips .",
    "the amplitude of the dip equals the source count rate at that energy , so that a spectrum of the source is built by taking the source count rate dips in successive energy channels .",
    "it is necessary to assume a model of the source s spatial distribution ; we chose a gaussian in ecliptic longitude of fwhm @xmath60 , which harris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found to be the best estimate for the distribution of the diffuse 511 kev annihilation line ( which is compatible with a nova - like distribution of sources : milne et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the energy channel binning in the region of interest to us around 478 kev was non - uniform and time - variable .",
    "this is because , as noted in  3.2 , data were only returned at the optimum 1 kev binning in a single 64-kev wide energy window centered approximately on 511 kev , and unfortunately the 478 kev line was on the edge of this window .",
    "energy resolution in the occulted data was therefore bad ( 8 kev ) on the red side , and moreover the transition between well- and coarse - binned data varied during the mission as the high - resolution window shifted with the instrument gain .    rather than using the complete 19951997 harris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) tgrs spectrum , we used a series of spectra summed over 90 d intervals which harris et al .",
    "also generated ( for their search for 511 kev line variability ) .",
    "this time - scale happens to be similar to that for significant variability of the gain .",
    "we could thus treat the gain shift as a constant and `` fix '' the location of the high - resolution window boundary in a manner that facilitated spectrum modeling .",
    "the 90 d spectra in the range 460490 kev were fitted by a model consisting of a power law plus a gaussian line at 478 kev .",
    "a typical example of this fit is shown in fig .",
    "4 . note the abrupt transition from coarse to fine binning in the middle of the energy range .",
    "the measured 478 kev line fluxes during 90 d intervals are shown in fig .",
    "5 . these results may be combined to give the total measured quasi - steady flux from the gc .",
    "it is clear that no line is detected , within limits which are given in table 2 .",
    "the sensitivity of this search is degraded by a factor 45 relative to that of the background - modeling method .",
    "this is mainly due to the gain shift problem mentioned above .",
    "table 2 also shows earlier measurements by _ smm _ for both individual novae and the quasi - steady integrated gc flux ( harris et al . 1991 ) . note that the integrated flux measurements are not exactly comparable , since the _ smm _ value comes from a very broad region @xmath61 across around the gc , whereas the tgrs value reflects the signal from the @xmath62 occulted region only",
    "from the flux upper limits in table 1 we calculate the @xmath1be abundances in the sources , given the distances .",
    "our limits improve upon the _ smm _ values by an order of magnitude for individual events , and by a factor 2 for the integrated flux from the gc .",
    "unfortunately we do not obtain proportionate improvements in the limits on the @xmath1be abundances from these fluxes , for two reasons . in the case of individual novae , by misfortune",

    "is divided among fewer novae .",
    "comparisons with theory must take into account the shortcomings and uncertainties in nova models ( see  2 ) . for our purposes",
    ", the prediction of any nova s @xmath1be mass may be factored into the product of the ejected mass @xmath64 , and the mass fraction @xmath65 of @xmath1be in it . in the favorable case of a massive co nova , `` optimistic '' models such as gmez - gomar et al .",

    "there are two arguments for this kind of scenario . and",

    "this is unlikely to be the case in actual models , although starrfield et al .",

    "( 1978 ) that , whereas models assume that the abundance of @xmath5he in the gas accreted onto the white dwarf is usually solar , this is probably not the case .",

    "older main sequence star models suggested @xmath5he enhancements @xmath70 times solar , while more recent models suggest a value about 50% of this ( morel et al .",

    "the model yields of @xmath1be are then probably enhanced by less than a factor 2.5 by the @xmath5he enhancement .",
    "most of the possible variation in the product is thus due to uncertainty in @xmath64 , of which our upper limits may be a test .    for the purpose of comparison with our upper limits ,",
    "we show in table 2 the fluxes that would be expected from each nova ( and from the gc ) if optimistic values @xmath71 and @xmath72 , similar to the old values of clayton ( 1981 ) , are assumed . in all cases ,",
    "our limits lie above the expected fluxes ; however some of the individual cases are of interest .",
    "our limit for by cir is only a factor @xmath73 above the expected value , even better than the _ smm _ limit for the much closer event v482 cen .",
    "these happen to be the only verified co novae in the two samples .",
    "thus we can exclude highly optimistic estimates of the ejecta masses , exceeding 12@xmath74 , for two members of this class of nova . given",
    "that cp cru is the only one event in the tgrs sample , with a limit on the flux 40 times the expected value , the same reasoning produces an upper limit @xmath75 for this class of event , improving on the _ smm _ limit by almost a factor 10 . from our result for the general case",
    ", we also exclude any undiscovered nova with optimistic `` clayton - like '' parameters having occurred within 1.1 kpc during 19951997 ; or any undiscovered nova of the highest - yielding gmez - gomar et al .",
    "( 1998 ) type ( co , @xmath76 ) within 134 pc .",
    "this work has established the feasibility of the time series modeling method of background subtraction (  4 ) , at least for resolvable lines ( not too severely blended ) , for @xmath0-ray emitters having appropriate time - scales  and especially for stable background lines amenable to very simple temporal models .",
    "an obvious improvement would be to model blended line complexes of astronomical interest , which would require much more sophisticated modeling than our semi - empirical approach .",
    "thus , work is under way to model the tgrs background spectrum ab initio , from the mass model and the gcr flux ( weidenspointner 2001c ) .",
    "some of the features that make this approach possible are included in the upcoming _ integral _ mission , in particular a high - resolution ge spectrometer ( spi ) , and a highly elliptical orbit which , like that of tgrs , avoids earth s trapped radiation belts ( winkler 1996 ) . if the background lines prove to be stable enough , it may be possible to apply our method to the off - source spi background .",
    "relative to tgrs , spi has much greater sensitivity , close to @xmath77 photon @xmath78 s@xmath15 at 478 kev .",
    "the best - case theoretical models in table 2 ( co , @xmath76 ) are then detectable at a distance of 500 pc ( hernanz & jos 2000 )",
    ". the more optimistic parameters @xmath79 , @xmath72 , similar to those of clayton ( 1981 ) , that we discussed in  6.1 and assumed in column 5 of table 2 for the purpose of flux comparisons , would enable spi to make detections out to 3.4 kpc .",
    "a detection distance of this order intercepts @xmath80% of the global nova distribution ( paper ii ) , two - thirds of which are of co subtype .",
    "if _ integral _ continues beyond its 2-year nominal mission to the 5-year extended mission , the number of novae it can be expected to detect is @xmath81 , which is @xmath82 for realistic values of @xmath83 yr@xmath15 .",
    "the prospects for a spi observation improving on our results are therefore quite good .",
    "we thank albert jones and frank bateson of the royal new zealand astronomical society for prediscovery limits on some of the novae in table 1 .",
    "we are grateful to theresa sheets ( lhea ) and sandhia bansal ( hstx ) for their work on the analysis software .",
