    "the supernovae ( sne ) of type ia are fundamental for understanding a number of astrophysical problems of primary importance , such as _ i ) _ the sn progenitors , _ ii ) _ the determination of cosmological parameters , _ iii ) _ the chemical enrichment of galaxies and _ iv ) _ the thermal history of the interstellar ( ism ) and intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the evolution of the rate of type ia sne with cosmic time is a fundamental ingredient for the study of all these issues .",
    "the observed features of sne ia suggest that the majority of these objects may originate from the thermonuclear explosion of a c - o white dwarf ( wd ) of mass @xmath5 m@xmath2 ( chandrasekhar mass ) in binary systems ( chandra exploders ) .",
    "so each sn ia should be the result of the explosion of the same mass .",
    "however , phillips ( 1993 ) pointed out that there is a significant intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light of local type ia sne .",
    "this result was interpreted to arise from a possible range of masses of the progenitors or from variations of the explosion mechanism .",
    "+ here we will consider only chandra exploders for which two scenarios have been proposed : a ) the _ single degenerate _ ( sd ) scenario ,",
    "i.e. the accretion of matter via mass transfer from a non - degenerate companion , a red giant or a main sequence star ( e.g. whelan & iben 1973 ) . in this scenario",
    "the mass range for the secondary components of the binary system is @xmath6m@xmath2 , while the primary masses should be in the range @xmath7 .",
    "the upper limit is given by the fact that stars with masses @xmath8 ignite carbon in a non - degenerate core and do not end their lives as c - o wds .",
    "the lower limit is instead obviously due to the fact that we are only interested in systems which can produce a type ia sn in a hubble time .",
    "the clock to the explosion is given by the lifetime of the secondary component .",
    "b ) the _ double degenerate _",
    "( dd ) scenario , i.e. the merging of two c - o wds which reach the chandrasekhar mass and explode by c - deflagration ( e.g. iben & tutukov 1984 ) .",
    "the merging is due to the loss of orbital angular momentum due to gravitational wave radiation . in the iben & tutukov paper ,",
    "the progenitor masses were defined in the range 5 - 8m@xmath2 to ensure two wds of @xmath9m@xmath2 and then reach the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the clock for the explosion in this model is given by the lifetime of the secondary star plus the time necessary to merge the system due to gravitational wave radiation .",
    "this scenario requires the formation of two degenerate c - o wds at an initial separation less than @xmath10 and this can occur by means of two different precursor systems : a close binary , and a wide binary .",
    "the two scenarios differ for the efficiency of the common envelope phase during the first mass transfer , and therefore for the separation attained at the end of the first common envelope phase .",
    "different arguments can be found in favor or against both sd and dd scenarios and the issue of dd vs. sd is still debated ( e.g. branch et al .",
    "1995 , napiwotzki et al .",
    "2002 , belczynski et al .",
    "the type ia sn rate is the convolution of the distribution of the explosion times , usually called the time delay distribution function ( dtd ) , with the star formation history .",
    "several attempts of comparing the type ia sn rate and the cosmic star formation rate evolution with redshift have already appeared ( e.g. gal - yam & maoz , 2004 ; dahlen et al . 2004",
    "; cappellaro et al . 2005 ; neill et al . 2006 ; forster et al . 2006 ; barris & tonry , 2006 ; poznansky et al . 2007 ; botticella et al . 2008 , blanc & greggio , 2008 ; among others ) , but no clear conclusions arised yet on this point .",
    "+ in this paper , besides the above mentioned scenarios for type ia sn progenitors we will test the empirical dtd suggested by mannucci et al .",
    "( 2006),together with different star formation histories .",
    "in particular , we will study the type ia sn rate in ellipticals and different cosmic star formation rates , including a strongly increasing cosmic star formation with redshift , based on the monolithic scenario of galaxy formation and never considered in previous studies .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the adopted formulation for the sn ia rate is presented , together with the description of the adopted star formation histories . in section 3 the models for the distribution function of the delay times are presented and in section 4 the predicted sn ia rates are discussed and compared with the availale data . finally , in section 5 some conclusions are drawn .",
    "from a theoretical point of view , the type ia sn rate is difficult to derive , because the nature of the progenitors of snia events is still an open question .",
    "+ one of the first model proposed for the calculation of the type ia sn rates was introduced by greggio & renzini ( 1983 , hereafter gr83 ) .",
    "this formulation is based on the whelan and iben ( 1973 ) model ( sd scenario ) .",
    "greggio ( 1996 ) revised the computation of the sn ia rate in the framework of the sd model and suggested a more detailed criterion for the formation of a system which can eventually explode as type ia sn .",
    "another model was proposed by kobayashi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and kobayashi , tsujimoto & nomoto ( 2000 ) .",
    "they adopted the hachisu et al .",
    "( 1996 ; 1999 ) model and considered two possible progenitor systems : either a wd plus a red giant ( rg ) star or a wd plus a main sequence ( ms ) star , plus a metallicity effect delaying the formation of systems which could give rise to sne ia .",
    "matteucci & recchi ( 2001 , hereafter mr01 ) calculated the type ia sn rate for different star formation histories in galaxies in the framework of the sd scenario .",
    "they concluded that the best prescriptions to obtain sn ia rates in agreement with the observations seems to be those of gr83 ( with respect to the approach developed by greggio 1996 and kobayashi et al .",
    "tornamb & matteucci ( 1986 ) formulated a sn ia rate in the dd scenario and applied it to galactic chemical evolution models . in the past years , many other authors ( e.g. ruiz - lapuente & canal , 1998 ; madau , della valle & panagia , 1998 ; dahlen & fransson , 1999 ; sadat et al .",

    "one of the most recent formulation is that of greggio ( 2005 , hereafter g05 ) which will be adopted here .      following the g05 formalism , at a given epoch _",
    "the sn ia rate is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the delay time , defined in the range ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , which are the minimum and maximum possible delay times ( i.e. the lifetimes of the secondaries in the sd model and the lifetimes of the secondaries plus the gravitational time delays in the dd model ) , so that : @xmath15 the constant @xmath16 is the number of stars per unit mass in one stellar generation and depends on the initial mass function ( imf ) : @xmath17 being @xmath18 the chosen imf , given by : @xmath19 where c is the normalization constant derived from : @xmath20 in this work we adopt a salpeter imf , for which @xmath16 is equal to 2.83 .",
    "@xmath21 is the fraction of binary systems which give rise to type ia sne relative to the whole range of star masses ( @xmath22 ) . in the formulation proposed by gr83 and mr01",

    "( 1 ) @xmath23 is a function of the epoch at which the stellar generation is born ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "however , in this work , this quantity is treated as a constant and it is chosen to reproduce the present day sn ia rate observed value .",
    "this formulation shows that the basic ingredients for computing the sn ia rates are the dtd and the star formation rate ( sfr ) , @xmath26 .    for the analysis described in this paper we consider the sfr of typical elliptical galaxies and the cosmic sfr , namely the sfr in a unit comoving volume of the universe containing galaxies of all morphological types .",
    "these functions are described in the following sections .",
    "the sfr , i.e. the amount of gas turning into stars per unit time , is usually expressed in m@xmath2 yr@xmath27 . in the case of elliptical galaxies we adopted the model of chemical evolution of pipino & matteucci ( 2004 ) .",
    "the model is based on the assumption that ellipticals form by means of a rapid collapse of pristine gas , thus producing very high rates of sf ( starburst - like regime ) .",
    "the sf is halted as the energy of the ism , heated by stellar winds and sn explosions , exceeds the binding energy of the gas , thus producing a galactic wind .",
    "this happens on a timescale always less than 1 gyr , varying with the galactic mass .",
    "after the development of this wind , no star formation is assumed to take place .",
    "the sn feedback is taken into account together with the cooling of sn remnants .",
    "massive but diffuse halos of dark matter around the galaxies are considered .",
    "the salpeter imf , considered constant in space and time , is adopted .",
    "the sfr has a simple form , given by the schmidt ( 1959 ) law , with an efficiency of star formation which is higher in more massive objects which evolve faster than less massive ones ( inverse - wind scenario by matteucci 1994 , also called _ downsizing _ ) .",
    "the reason for this choice is that an increasing efficiency of star formation with mass reproduces very well the observed increase of [ mg / fe ] versus mass in ellipticals .",
    "therefore , the efficiency of star formation has been calibrated to reproduce such a relation ( see pipino & matteucci 2004 for details ) . as it can be seen in fig . 1",
    ", we consider the specific sfrs ( ssfr , i.e. the sfr per unit mass ) corresponding to typical ellipticals of @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath28 of luminous mass . these histories of sf will then be used in the next chapter to predict the sn ia rate under different assumptions about the dtd function .    , taken from pipino & matteucci ( 2004 ) .",

    "we have selected five different cases for the sfrd , as proposed in the literature .",
    "the models are those proposed by calura matteucci & menci ( 2004 , hereafter cmm04 ) , whereas the others are from madau , della valle & panagia ( 1998 , hereafter mdp98 ) , strolger et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter s04 ) and cole et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and they are the best fits to various observations .",
    "it is worth noting that some of them predict a decrease of the sfrd at high redshift , in agreement with the hierarchical clustering scenario , but not supported by the present data indicating a rather constant behaviour ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . in particular , classical hierarchical clustering ( hc ) models for galaxy formation predict that ellipticals form continuously from the mergers of bulge - disk systems or other ellipticals , and that most galaxies never experience sfrs in excess of a few solar masses per year . on the other hand , in the monolithic scenario the spheroids form first and",
    "the sfrs in massive systems can be as high as thousands solar masses per year .",
    "cmm04 computed the theoretical cosmic sfrd as a function of redshift by means of detailed chemical evolution models for galaxies of different morphological types ( ellipticals , spirals and irregulars ) .",

    "<S> the purpose of this work is the computation of the cosmic type ia supernova rates , namely the frequency of type ia supernovae per unit time in a unitary volume of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> our main goal in this work is to predict the type ia supernova rates at very high redshifts and to check whether it is possible to select the best delay time distribution model , on the basis of the available observations of type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the cosmic type ia supernova rates in different scenarios for galaxy formation and predict the expected number of explosions at high redshift ( @xmath0 ) . moreover , we adopt various progenitor models in order to compute the type ia supernova rate in typical elliptical galaxies of initial luminous masses of @xmath1m@xmath2 , @xmath3m@xmath2 and @xmath4m@xmath2 , and compute the total amount of iron produced by type ia supernovae in each case . in this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we assume that type ia supernovae are caused by thermonuclear explosions of c - o white dwarfs in binary systems and we consider the most popular frameworks : the single degenerate and the double degenerate scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the two competing schemes for the galaxy formation , namely the monolithic collapse and the hierarchical clustering , are also taken into account , by considering the histories of star formation increasing and decreasing with redshift , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the type ia supernova rates through an analytical formulation which rests upon the definition of the sn ia rate following an instantaneous burst of star formation as a function of the time elapsed from the birth of the progenitor system to its explosion as a type ia supernova ( i.e. the delay time ) . </S>",
    "<S> what emerges from this work is that : _ </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ we confirm the result of previous papers that it is not easy to select the best delay time distribution scenario from the observational data and this is because the cosmic star formation rate dominates over the distribution function of the delay times ; _ ii ) _ the monolithic collapse scenario for galaxy formation predicts an increasing trend of the sn ia rate at high redshifts ( mainly due to the contribution by massive spheroids ) , whereas the predicted rate in the framework of a decreasing cosmic star formation rate , more in agreement with the hierarchical scenario , drops dramatically at high redshift ; _ iii ) _ for the elliptical galaxies we note that the predicted maximum of the type ia supernova rate depends on the initial galactic mass . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum occurs earlier ( at about 0.3 gyr ) in the most massive ellipticals , as a consequence of the assumed downsizing in star formation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the type ia supernova rate per unit mass at the present time is higher in bluer ellipticals ( i.e. the less massive ones ) .    </S>",
    "<S> stars : binaries - supernovae : general - galaxies : evolution . </S>"
