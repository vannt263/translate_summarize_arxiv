    "the modeling of the expansion of a plasma plume in the vicinity of a spacecraft has been intensively investigated in the last several years .",
    "in particular , in the context of space electric propulsion systems , such as ion or hall thrusters , a correct characterization of the emitted plasma plume is of crucial importance to avoid interactions between the energetic particles and spacecraft surface , and thus to potentially prevent severe damages to the spacecraft @xcite .",
    "similarly , in plasma contactor technology ( for instance , electrodynamics tether applications ) , it is important to predict the shape and geometry of the plasma plume emitted by a spacecraft @xcite .",
    "+ due to the large difference in density between the plasma plume and the background magnetospheric plasma , the physics of the plume expansion is often well described by the expansion of plasma in vacuum , which has also been investigated thoroughly for several different geometries @xcite .",
    "the first - principle numerical calculation of the steady - state profiles reached by the expansion of a plasma plume in a large domain is very challenging , due to the wide separation of scales involved .",
    "for instance , the plasma debye length can vary by several orders of magnitudes in few hundred meters along the expansion trajectory .",
    "therefore , numerical simulations are usually constrained to either the near- or the far - field expansion , i.e. , to a restricted simulation domain @xcite . +",
    "a very appealing alternative to expensive numerical simulations is , of course , to seek for analytical solutions of the plume expansion .",
    "this is often done by assuming that the plasma obeys simplified fluid equations @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we analyze and discuss the self - similar solutions presented in refs .",
    "it is important to notice that the self - similar approach used in such models is different from the standard procedure followed in similarity methods described , for instance , in classical textbooks @xcite .",
    "in fact , the standard approach is based on the idea of reducing the dimensionality of a set of partial differential equations , through an appropriate variable transformation , that can be identified by exploiting the symmetries of the system . on the other hand , the models described in this paper",
    "retain their full - dimensionality , and are based on a variable transformation constructed on the principle that one variable is constant along fluid streamlines . another crucial point to notice , is that the solutions presented in refs .",
    "@xcite are approximate solutions .",
    "as we will show , the self - similarity assumption is indeed inconsistent with the fluid model employed and , as such , the solutions obtained do not exactly solve the initial set of equations .",
    "however , such solutions , albeit inexact , have the advantage that they can be quickly evaluated on an arbitrary large domain .",
    "for this reason , they can still be valuable , if one is able to estimate how large their error is with respect to the true solution , and , of course , if such error is reasonably small .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "first , we analyze the earlier solutions of refs .",
    "@xcite and we measure their errors with respect to the numerical solution of the underlying fluid equations .",
    "second , we present a generalization of such solutions , in an attempt to provide a more flexible family of solutions that can have a wider range of applicability . + the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 1 presents the mathematical model , the self - similarity assumption , and the resulting set of equations . in section 2",
    ", we describe the approximate solutions presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , and we comment on their range of validity and respective errors . in section 3 , we describe a new class of solutions , that is based on a generalization of previous models , and we show that they are indeed applicable to a wider class of situations . in section 4 we show how to easily extend the solutions that were derived for a plasma with no azimuthal velocity to a more general case .",
    "finally , we draw conclusions of this study in section 5 .",
    "we study a system composed by collisionless , singly charged , ions and electrons , in a steady - state , axisymmetric configuration .",
    "we assume that electrons inertia can be neglected , quasi - neutrality holds , the plasma is electrostatic , and there is no background magnetic field . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume cold ions although a polytropic equation of state for ions might be easily incorporated in the model . by employing cylindrical coordinates",
    "@xmath0 the ion continuity equation and the conservation of ion and electron momentum read : @xmath1 where the symmetry condition @xmath2 has been used , @xmath3 is the density , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the ion axial and radial velocities , @xmath6 is the electrostatic potential , and @xmath7 is the electron pressure .",
    "( [ continuity])-([mom_el ] ) are complemented by a polytropic equation of state for the electrons : @xmath8 with @xmath9 the polytropic index .",
    "quantities have been normalized as follows : velocities to @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 a reference electron temperature and @xmath12 the ion mass ) , the electrostatic potential to @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 the elementary charge ) , density to a reference density @xmath15 , lengths to a characteristic length @xmath16 , and pressure to @xmath17 . in general , the value of the polytropic index @xmath9 depends on the degree of ionization of the plasma @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite have reported experimental results for thrusters , with @xmath9 lower than @xmath18 , and @xcite have used the value 1.3 for their pic simulations . however , as shown in ref.@xcite , @xmath9 tends to the neutral gas theoretical value for a fully ionized plasma , which , for simplicity , is the case treated in this paper . hence , for all the cases presented here @xmath19 , i.e. the adiabatic constant of the monoatomic perfect gas .",
    "+ the model in eqs .",
    "( [ continuity])-([mom_el ] ) must be interpreted as a boundary value problem in the two - dimensional plane @xmath20 .",
    "since the equations involved are first order partial differential equations , one is allowed to specify the boundary conditions at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which determine the solution in the whole domain .",
    "also , note that the electron pressure and the electric potential can be substituted in eqs .",
    "( [ mom_r])-([mom_z ] ) , and post - processed after the solution for @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 , and @xmath23 has been obtained .",
    "we now elucidate the procedure to seek for a self - similar solution of eqs.([continuity])-([mom_el ] ) , extending the derivation in @xcite to the case @xmath24 .",
    "first , we introduce a change of variable @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 an unspecified function .",
    "then , we assume that the unknowns @xmath28 can be factorized as : @xmath29 where prime indicates differentiation , and @xmath30 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the definition for @xmath5 , equation ( [ eq_ur ] ) , follows from assuming that lines of constant @xmath31 correspond to streamlines , that is @xmath32 as we anticipated , the set of equations ( [ continuity])-([mom_el ] ) is actually inconsistent with the separation of variables assumed in ( [ eq_n])-([eq_utheta ] ) .",
    "that is , the only solution that satisfies such separation of variables is the trivial solution with @xmath33 all constant .",
    "however , the separation of variables is still worth considering if one can derive a class of approximate solutions for our model that are much faster to compute than the exact numerical solution , and its error relative to the full solution is small . + it is straightforward to prove that eq.([eq_theta ] ) is automatically satisfied by using the factorization assumption in eqs.([eq_n])-([eq_utheta ] ) . substituting eqs.([eq_n])-([eq_ur ] ) into eqs.([continuity])-([mom_el ] ) and separating each equation in @xmath31 and @xmath34 dependent terms , one can get the following set of equations for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath27 : @xmath37 and the the following equations for @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are arbitrary ( separation ) constants .",

    "clearly , we have a set of 6 equations for only 5 unknowns , and the system is overdetermined .",
    "in order to derive an approximate solution of the model , a common approach is to assume @xmath47 and to prescribe a certain profile for @xmath48 . in this way one can still satisfy some ( but not all ) of the equations ( [ z_cont])-([r_momr ] ) . for simplicity , and to be adherent to earlier literature , we consider in this section the case where @xmath49 , and thus @xmath46 .",
    "all of the solutions discussed here satisfy the continuity equation and the conservation of momentum in @xmath45 , but not in @xmath34 . from equations ( [ z_cont ] ) , ( [ z_momr ] ) , and ( [ r_momr ] )",

    "+ since we are only interested in the steady state solution , we have used the following marching scheme for solving numerically eqs.([continuity])-([mom_el ] ) .",
    "first , the solution is calculated on the partial domain @xmath59\\times[0,4\\delta z]$ ] with an iterative newton - gmres solver @xcite .",
    "the solution is then extended to the full domain by adding one row of cells in @xmath34 at the time and calculating the new solution at each step .",
    "this is possible since we use an upwind discretization in @xmath34 that requires only the points where the solution has already been calculated .",
