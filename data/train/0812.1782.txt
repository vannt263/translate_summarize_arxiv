    "it is well - known that in nonrelativistic systems , by tuning attractive interactions between fermions , a bcs superfluid of degenerate fermions can be smoothly connected to a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of fermion pairs . for nonrelativistic fermi gases ,",
    "it was shown @xcite that the bcs ground state captures important features in both limits .",
    "study of intermediate phases in between these two limits is called bcs - bec crossover , which has been intensely studied in high - temperature superconductors @xcite and ultra - cold fermi gases @xcite . in ultra - cold fermi gases",
    ", it was demonstrated that number density asymmetry @xcite or heteronuclear pairing @xcite can also be realized .",
    "recently , the idea of bcs - bec crossover has been applied to relativistic systems of fermions @xcite .",
    "this work is motivated by two observations .",
    "the first comes from color superconductivity of quarks , which has drawn intense attention in high - energy physics @xcite . at very high baryon density ,",
    "the ground state of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is believed to be color superconducting states such as the color - flavor locking ( cfl ) state or the two - flavor superconducting ( 2sc ) state @xcite .",
    "these states have diquark pairs , which are similar to cooper pairs of electrons in conventional superconductors . at low baryon density ,",
    "the system becomes hadronic matters @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that as baryon density decreases , diquark pairs with small pair size comparable to quark - quark distance may emerge .",
    "the condensate of these tightly bound diquark pairs are similar to the bec of cooper pairs in the bcs - bec crossover of nonrelativistic fermionic systems .",
    "therefore there may exist a crossover from a color superconducting state with weakly bound quark pairs ( of large size ) at high baryon density to a ( relativistic ) bec state of diquarks at low baryon density before the system becomes hadronic matters @xcite .",
    "perturbative methods , which can only be applied at high baryon densites , are not appropriate for studying this crossover .",
    "the second observation comes from the fact that a relativistic bec ( rbec ) state may appear even in a nonrelativistic fermi system if the attractive interaction is strong enough @xcite . in an rbec phase , there is an appreciable density of antifermions .",
    "typically , when the @xmath0-wave scattering length @xmath1 of a nonrelativistic system approaches the limit @xmath2 , relativistic effects will become significant since the binding energy of a fermion pair is @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the fermion mass .",
    "in addition to these observations , a crossover in qcd similar to a bcs - bec crossover of nonrelativistic fermions may also be possible in a pion superfluid or in the interior of compact stars @xcite .",
    "we study possible phases of a two - species relativistic fermi gas with presumably tunable attraction .",
    "our approach is inspired by bcs - leggett theory of nonrelativistic fermi gases .",
    "number density asymmetry ( or polarization ) , which has been intensely studied in ultra - cold fermi gases , is included in our calculations .",
    "this is important because many interesting phases such as polarized superfluid , phase separation in real space , larkin - ovchinnikov - fulde - ferrell ( loff ) state @xcite , may be observed in nonrelativistic neutral fermi gases @xcite . to compare with those results",
    ", we only study neutral relativistic fermi gases .",
    "past work on relativistic bcs - bec crossover introduced models including one species of fermions @xcite as well as models including two - species of fermions @xcite .",
    "considerations of two ( or more ) species of fermions are natural since pairing among quarks with different color or flavor indices may exist at moderate baryon densities . ref .",
    "@xcite implemented a variational approach with a coherent state .",
    "missing from this work is an analysis of the stability of superfluid phases .",
    "@xcite studied a model with auxiliary boson fields .",
    "conversion between fermions and bosons induces indirect fermion - fermion attraction .",
    "although such a boson - fermion model is possible for ultra - cold fermions across a feshbach resonance , it may not be necessary for providing a mechanism for diquark pairing . here",
    "we consider effective attraction between fermions without any auxiliary boson field .",
    "we will present phase diagrams as a function of polarization and the strength of the attractive interaction .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we analyze the mechanical stability of homogeneous polarized superfluids .",
    "when they are unstable , one expects a phase in which a superfluid and a normal fermi gas can be found in separated spatial regimes .",
    "this is an example of phase separation ( or mixed states ) .",
    "this inhomogeneous phase has been discussed in neutral fermionic systems such as ultra - cold fermions @xcite and quark matter in neutron stars @xcite .",
    "however , phase separation may not be stable for charged fermions @xcite . in charged fermi gases with number density asymetry",
    ", there is another instability , magnetic instability ( or chromo - magnetic instability in color superconductivity ) , which is associated with the existence of an imaginary meissner mass of gauge bosons @xcite . in the mechanically unstable regimes of homogeneous superfluids ,",
    "there are other possible phases in additional to phase separation .",
    "for example , the loff state @xcite is also possible in the weakly attractive regime , but here we do not consider this state since we are mainly interested in the strongly attractive regime . a third possibility are chiral condensates with @xmath5 , which become dominant when baryon density is low enough",
    ". a phase of competition and/or coexistence between ( r)bec states of @xmath6-condensates and @xmath7-condensates may exist before the chiral condensate phases completely dominate @xcite .",
