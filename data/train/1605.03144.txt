    "there is a need for broadband and intense light sources in the mid ir as most molecules display a distinctive spectral fingerprint in this spectral region . in particular ,",
    "some spectral sub - bands within this region can not be addressed by ir sources such as quantum cascade lasers ( qcls ) @xcite .",
    "this problem can be tackled by supercontinuum generation through an adequate pumping scheme and choice of transmission medium .",
    "intense and short pump pulses are best , although high cw powers can trigger sc generation as well @xcite .",
    "pulsed co~2~ lasers are readily available and can provide intense nanosecond pulses around 10 m , and at 5 m through second - harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "tabletop cw co~2~ lasers can easily achieve kilowatt levels .",
    "co lasers can also generate high power levels around 5 m @xcite .",
    "this leaves us with the choice of an appropriate parametric medium .",
    "unfortunately , a well - known material such as silica ( optical fibers ) can not be used , as its absorption becomes prohibitively large above 2.4 m. chalcogenide glasses , on the other hand , display very low absorption up to 16 m @xcite .",
    "other appealing characteristics of chalcogenide glasses include a zero - dispersion wavelength typically above 4 - 5 m ( close to the pump wavelength , thus minimizing the phase mismatching of nonlinear interactions ) , an almost linear dispersion profile with a small dispersion slope , and a very high nonlinear index ( up to 1000 times that of silica ) .",
    "as such , mid - ir sc generation in chalcogenide media has gathered considerable attention in recent years .",
    "there have been demonstrations of sc generation in chalcogenide step - index fibers up to 8 m by pumping at 4 m with 320-fs pulses @xcite , and from 1.4 to 13.3 m by pumping at 6.3 m with 100-fs pulses @xcite , including some impressive demonstrations in bulk glasses from 2.5 to 7.5 m , by pumping at 5.3 m with 150-fs pulses of 20 mw peak power @xcite , and from 0.2 to 8 m by pumping at 1.6 m with 180-fs pulses with an astonishing 1.13 gw peak power @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the study of sc generation in the mid ir , and the observation of the accompanying rogue wave phenomenon , by means of low - power pumping of a chalcogenide waveguide in both short - pulse and cw regimes .",
    "furthermore , we show that the low and flat dispersion characteristics of chalcogenide media in the spectral region of interest , conveniently modeled by an expansion of only up to the fourth - order in the propagation constant , allow to capture the relevant pulse dynamics and to attain most of the sc spectral width in both regimes .",
    "we start by solving the generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation ( gnlse ) expressed as @xcite    @xmath0    the number of terms @xmath1 on the left hand side is 4 in most of the simulations .",
    "some simulations were performed using @xmath2 in order to show that the inclusion of only four terms is enough to capture the main aspects of the resulting behavior .",
    "@xmath3 ps^2^/km , @xmath4 ps^3^/km , @xmath5 ps^4^/km , and @xmath6 ps^5^/km are the dispersion parameters , and were so chosen to be consistent with the measured dispersion profile of a chalcogenide glass in the anomalous dispersion region @xcite , i.e. , a small ( negative ) and flat dispersion in the spectral region of interest , yielding a zero - dispersion wavelength at @xmath74.7 m. @xmath8 ( w - km)@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the nonlinear terms around @xmath11 , the angular frequency corresponding to 5 m. it is important to point out that the chosen value for @xmath12 represents a lower limit for a chalcogenide glass , consistent with a nonlinear refractive index of @xmath7100 times that of silica taking as a reference the typical effective area of a step - index silica fiber @xcite .",
    "the response function @xmath13 in the convolution integral of ( [ eq : gnlse ] ) is given by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , the raman response of the medium , is approximated as    @xmath16    @xmath17 ps , @xmath18 ps and @xmath19 were chosen to match the measured raman gain spectrum , with a gain peak shift of 10 thz , in a chalcogenide glass @xcite .",
    "we consider a pump at 5 m , in two cases : short pulses with hyperbolic secant envelope @xmath20 , @xmath21 fs and @xmath22 kw ; and a 1-kw continuous wave . in both cases",
    ", noise is added to the input electric field in order to achieve a realistic optical signal - to - noise ratio of 40 db ( pulsed ) and 60 db ( cw ) , where the noise power is measured in a 50-ghz ( pulsed ) and a 61-ghz ( cw ) bandwidth .",
    "spontaneous raman emission is not taken into account in the analysis as its effect can be neglected compared to that of shot noise @xcite .",
    "results are presented for an average of many noise realizations .",
    "last , the waveguide is assumed to be an arbitrary 50-cm long . for a waveguide",
    "this long , attenuation can be neglected , and , thus , is not included in equation [ eq : gnlse ] , as it can be lower than 0.6 db / m for a chalcogenide glass fiber at the pump wavelength @xcite .",
    "also , the waveguide length was chosen to guarantee stability of the results , as we verified that longer lengths and/or higher peak powers lead to numerical instability when using standard double - precision , and reasonable small step sizes , in conjunction with the rk4-ip algorithm @xcite used to solve the gnlse .",
    "other simulation parameters include ( resp . , pulsed and cw ) : integration step sizes of 100 and 2.5 micra ; 8192 and 16384 points for time / frequency representation ; 2.4 fs and 1 fs time resolutions ; and , 50 ghz and 61 ghz frequency resolutions .",
    "output spectra are shown in figs . [",
    "fig : sfig11 ] and [ fig : sfig12 ] for the pulsed ( average of 10000 noise realizations ) and cw ( average of a 1000 noise realizations ) cases , respectively .",
    "we observe sc generation beyond 10 m ( measured at 20-db width ) .",
    "several differences can be observed between the pulsed and cw cases .",
    "while the maximum is above 3 m in the former case , it is close to 2 m in the latter .",
    "moreover , in the pulsed case there is another local maximum close to 6 m which is not coincident with the pump wavelength .",
    "finally , the spectrum decreases faster with decreasing frequency in the case of short pump pulses than in the continuous wave pump .    in order to show that the generated sc is observed at a low pump power ,",
    "it is interesting to compare our findings with results in the literature .",
    "reference @xcite shows sc generation from 1.8 to 10 m ( measured at the 40-db point ) , by pumping a 11-cm chalcogenide fiber , @xmath23 ( w - km)@xmath9 , with 330 fs pulses of 3 kw peak power produced by an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) . in terms of nonlinearity ,",
    "the accumulated phase ( @xmath24 ) is 60% higher than in our case . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a 10 m sc spectral width ( at the 30-db point ) is demonstrated by pumping a short chalcogenide waveguide at 4.184 m with 330 fs , 4.5 kw pulses , yielding an accumulated nonlinear phase similar to that in our case . in the aforementioned references",
    ", the observed spectral width is narrower than the one reported here ; we also note that , while in both papers the pump wavelength is located between two zero - dispersion wavelengths ( zdws ) , we assume a simple dispersion profile with a single zdw .",
    "moreover , the pump wavelength and power level in these references require the use of complex opas , while our proposal requires ready - to - use tabletop ( pulsed or cw ) co@xmath25/co lasers .",
    "finally , simulation results in both papers use a dispersion profile modeled up to the 20th order . in this work , however , we show that it suffices to employ a simple 4th - order model capturing general dispersion characteristics of chalcogenide media . in another recent work @xcite , a comparable sc width",
    "is reported , but with a pump power at the megawatt level .",
    "as mentioned before , the dispersion profile is essentially flat in the region of interest , and this leads us to expand the propagation constant up to the fourth order . to justify this choice , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig31 ] we show the output spectra ( pulsed case ) when considering dispersion effects up to the third , fourth , and fifth order , respectively .",
    "we readily observe that the inclusion of the fifth order term leads to similar results as compared to the case where up to fourth - order dispersion is taken into account , in particular when looking in a one - octave span .",
    "figure [ fig : sfig32 ] shows results for the cw case , where we observe no significant differences due to higher - order dispersion .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the time evolution along the waveguide , displaying the complex pulse interaction expected from soliton dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig21 ] , pulsed case ) and the signature of pulse trains and ensuing soliton dynamics characteristic of modulation instability - induced sc generation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig22 ] , cw case ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the emergence of new pulses occurs at approximately the same traveled distance into the fiber , @xmath26 cm , in both cases .",
    "although one may be tempted to propose a soliton fission mechanism for the initial formation of sub - pulses in the pulsed - pump case , a few calculations show that this can not be the dominant factor .",
    "the input pulse corresponds to a soliton of order @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the soliton fission length is usually estimated as @xmath28 cm @xcite , which is longer than the waveguide .",
    "thus , modulation instability appears to be the cause of the initial optical pulse breakdown .",
    "[ fig : sfig51 ] shows the evolution of the spectrum along the waveguide for the pulsed case .",
    "the symmetrical broadening in the form of a ` v ' shape , observed in the first few centimeters into the waveguide , is a typical signature of self - phase modulation ( spm ) .",
    "[ fig : sfig52 ] shows the average spectrum at 8 cm together with the spectrum in the case where the input pump is noiseless .",
    "it also shows the gain spectrum due to modulation instability ( mi ) , calculated taking into account high - order dispersion @xcite , as a direct calculation using the standard formula ( @xmath29 , see @xcite ) yields a higher frequency offset .",
    "taking into account that the sub - pulses that emerge near the input end of the waveguide are approximately 30 fs wide ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig22 ] ) and noting that non - negligible spectral content at @xmath30 30 thz appears only in the noisy - input case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig52 ] ) , it can be concluded that the initial breakdown into pulses is due to noise - seeded modulation instability .",
    "similarly , in the cw case , noise - seeded modulation instability leads to the formation of a pulse train with a period @xmath7 30 fs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig22 ] ) consistent with the location of the maxima of the mi - gain spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfig52 ] ) .    from the previous results , and",
    "the large amount of noise realizations , it is only natural to explore the possible occurrence of rogue events .",
    "figures [ fig : sfig41 ] and [ fig : sfig42 ] show results obtained for pulse - intensity statistics for 5000 ( pulsed ) and 500 ( cw ) noise realizations , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the cw case produces a much larger number of pulses for each realization as compared to the pulsed case ; as such , a significant number of events can be attained with a relatively small number of noise realizations .",
    "in both cases , the classical signature of a long tail ( l shape ) distribution is observed , pointing at the enhanced probability of extreme events .",
    "specifically , by choosing the usually adopted threshold for such events @xcite , namely the so - called significant wave height , corresponding to twice the average of the upper third of the intensity distribution , we find that approximately 0.3% and 0.15% correspond to rogue waves for the pulsed and cw cases , respectively .",
    "insets in figures [ fig : sfig41 ] and [ fig : sfig42 ] show examples of some of the highest - power resulting pulses , @xmath7 7 kw in the pulsed case and @xmath7 14 kw in the continuous wave case .",
    "it is interesting to emphasize that we observe the occurrence of these extreme events resorting to a very simple dispersion profile , as compared to results in the literature that include up to 10th - orden dispersion , and at similar levels of nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "we showed , through numerical modeling , the feasibility of supercontinuum generation in the mid  ir by pumping a chalcogenide waveguide with a pump wavelength at 5 m , both in the short pulse and cw regimes .",
    "furthermore , in both cases initial breakdown into short pulses appears to be due to noise - seeded modulation instability , and supercontinuum generation proceeds through soliton dynamics and raman self - frequency shift .",
    "we found substantial spectral content beyond 10 m , a promising result as it points to the feasibility of covering a larger part of the mid - ir window by means of sc generation through low - power pumping readily available from co~2~/co lasers .",
    "further , we investigated the role of the dispersion profile of the chalcogenide medium , showing that inclusion of only up to the fourth - order term is sufficient to account for the observed rich pulse dynamics and sc spectral width within one - octave span .",
    "extensive simulation of noise realizations in both pulsed and cw cases allowed us to study some of the statistical properties of the output pulses , and found evidence of rogue wave events . deeper analysis and control of such events may lead to more stable sc sources for real mid - ir applications such as molecular spectroscopy , metrology and tomography , among others .",
    "the authors wish to thank e. cortizo , i. tarnapolsky , and j. bentez for enlightening discussions ."
