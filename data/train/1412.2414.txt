    "given a symplectic manifold @xmath3 , an integrable hamiltonian system ( or ihs ) can be defined as a function @xmath4 such that its components are poisson - commuting and whose differential is of maximal rank almost everywhere . from now",
    ", @xmath5 will always designate for us an ihs .",
    "a point @xmath6 such that @xmath7 is of rank @xmath8 is called a regular point for @xmath5 ; it is called critical if otherwise , and in particular it is called fixed if @xmath9 .",
    "we shall note the rank @xmath10 , or just @xmath11 if the context is obvious .    for ihs ,",
    "the famous liouville - arnold - mineur theorem provides a particularly appropriate set of local coordinates near regular points , the action - anglecoordinates .",
    "it can be formulated by considering the foliation @xmath12 given by the connected components of the fibers of @xmath5 .",
    "the theorem states that for regular leaves of @xmath12 ( i.e. leaves without critical points ) , the germ of foliation is locally a fibration by lagrangian tori .",
    "the problem is that a generic ihs does have critical points on which one can not apply liouville - arnold - mineur theorem .",
    "one question then , is to examine what can be preserved of the inital result for critical points .",
    "another question is to find the largest open subset of the set of regular points of @xmath5 on which the period bundle can be trivialized , that is , what are the obstructions to having _ global _ action - anglecoordinates .    over the last decades ,",
    "a lot of work has been produced for both questions .",
    "the study of non - degenerate critical points of ihs goes back from the works of birkhoff and williamson  @xcite , to the works of bolsinov and fomenko  @xcite , rss , colin de verdire , vey  @xcite , eliasson , zung , miranda , san v ngc  @xcite , chaperon  @xcite@xcite and many other , including the author  @xcite . concerning the existence of global action - anglecoordinates",
    ", we cite the works of duistermaat who established among other obstructions to global action - anglecoordinates the monodromy phenomenon which occurs in particular in our case , and explicited the matrix associated to it  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "dazord and delzant  @xcite extended the study to coisotropic foliations , while dufour , molino and toulet began to study the case with critical points @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this article deals mostly with the first question , yet the two questions are deeply linked . as we shall see",
    ", once we have the proper local model to describe what occurs near focus - focus singularities , the monodromy matrix becomes very easy to calculate .",
    "we consider mainly singularity of maximal corank ( see precise definition in section  [ subsection : toric and semi - toric system ] for precise definition ) .",
    "our main result is the existence of suitable coordinates , in which the action integrals near the focus - focus singulaity have a simple expression where the singular behaviour and the multi - valuedness is expressed by a simple complex logarithm ( theorem  [ theo : aa_coord_around_ff_value ] ) . with these coordinates , it is possible to compute the monodromy matrix .",
    "the two results we establish here extend the result proved in @xcite for the case @xmath13 to higher dimension and with possible elliptic components .",
    "the article is organised as following : first , we set the necessary notions nedded for a precise formulation of the result .",
    "next , we present in details the counterpart of morse theory for integrable hamiltonian systems at the local and semi - global scale . then , we prove our main result , compute the topological monodromy matrix and give a comment to the case with elliptic components .",
    "in order to give a precise formulation of our result , we need to recall the notion of non - degeneracy for integrable hamiltonian systems . we shall discuss the counterpart of the morse theory that we obtain in that framework .",
    "remember first that @xmath14 is naturally equipped with a poisson bracket @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is a lie algebra . at a fixed point @xmath17 of a function @xmath18 ,",
    "one can associate a quadratic form @xmath19_p \\in s^2(t_p m)^*$ ] by taking the hessian of @xmath20 in a local set of coordinates . it is well defined ( it does not depends of the local coordinates ) because @xmath17 is a fixed point .",
    "the symplectic form @xmath21 induces a poisson bracket @xmath22 on @xmath23 in the following way :    @xmath24_p,{\\mathcal{h}}[g]_p \\}_p : = { \\mathcal{h}}[\\{f , g\\}]_p,\\ ] ] and @xmath25 is a lie algebra isomorphic to @xmath26 , the lie algebra of the symplectic group .",
    "now , reminding that a cartan subalgebra of a lie algebra @xmath27 is a subalgebra of @xmath27 which is abelian and self - centralizing , we can define the following    a fixed point @xmath17 for @xmath5 is said to be _ non - degenerate _ if @xmath28_p,\\ldots,{\\mathcal{h}}[f_n]_p \\rangle$ ] , the subalgebra spanned by the hessians of the components of @xmath5 at @xmath17 , is a cartan subalgebra of @xmath29 .",
    "now , to define a non - degeneracy condition for critical points of arbitrary rank , we remark that @xmath23 is isomorphic as a lie algebra to a subalgebra of @xmath30 , the algebra of quadratic forms of @xmath31 .",
    "we consider a critical point @xmath32 of @xmath33 for @xmath5 of rank @xmath11 , and we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath34 .",
    "we can thus apply darboux - caratheodory theorem to the system @xmath35 : there exists a symplectomorphism @xmath36 with @xmath37 and such that @xmath38 are canonical coordinates @xmath39 for @xmath40 . in these local coordinates , since the @xmath41 are poisson commuting , @xmath42 do not depend of @xmath43 .",
    "we define the function @xmath44 , @xmath45 as @xmath46 .    a critical point of rank @xmath11",
    "is called _ non - degenerate _ if for the @xmath47 s defined above , the hessians @xmath48_0 $ ] span a cartan subalgebra of @xmath49 .",
    "a hamiltonian system is called non - degenerate if all its critical points are non - degenerate .",
    "relying on the decomposition of cartan subalgebras of @xmath50 , one can give the following classification result of non - degenerate critical points due to williamson  @xcite :    let @xmath6 a nondegenerate critical point for @xmath5 an ihs .",
    "then there exists a symplectomorphism @xmath51 such that @xmath52    * @xmath53 * @xmath54 * @xmath55    the theorem introduces three classes of possible `` components '' at a critical point ( apart from the regular components @xmath56 ) : elliptic ( the @xmath57 s ) , hyperbolic ( the @xmath58 s ) , and focus - focus ( the couples @xmath59 ) .",
    "we can thus define the following notations    given @xmath60 an ihs , and we can associate to @xmath61 the following _ williamson type _ ( with respect to @xmath5 ) , or _ williamson index _",
    "@xmath62 with    * @xmath63 number of _ elliptic _ ( or @xmath64 ) components , * @xmath65 number of _ focus - focus _ ( or @xmath66 ) components , * @xmath67 number of _ hyperbolic _ ( or @xmath68 ) components , * @xmath69 number of _ transverse _ ( or @xmath70 ) components , that is the regular components .    we may also use the notation @xmath71 instead of @xmath72 .",
    "we also define    @xmath73    note that the four coefficients are linked by the following equation    @xmath74    the set @xmath75 is defined as the set of different williamson types that occurs for a given ihs @xmath5 . when equipped with the following relation @xmath76",
    "it is a ( partially ) ordered set ( the term _ poset _ also appears in the litterature ) .",

    "this is the ordered set involved in the stratification mentioned in section  [ subsection : the_general_case ] .",
    "we can also define consistently the williamson type of a leaf ( see  [ subsection : semi - global_theory ] ) as follows    [ def : williamson_type_leaf ] given a leaf @xmath98 , the williamson type @xmath99 , or @xmath72 if it is unambiguous , is the williamson type of the point of smallest rank .",
    "lastly , we introduce the useful following sets    let @xmath100 be an open set .",
    "we define @xmath101 ( resp .",
    "@xmath102 ) is the set of critical points ( resp .",
    "leaves ) of type @xmath72 in @xmath103 . finally , we define @xmath104 , the set of critical values in @xmath105 of williamson type @xmath72 .    in the above definition , @xmath106 ( resp .",

    "union of leaves of @xmath12 , resp .",
    "subsets of @xmath109 ) , with inclusions as morphisms .",
    "since the fibers of the moment map are not a priori connected , a critical value may belong to @xmath110 and @xmath111 with @xmath72 and @xmath112 possibly different , and @xmath103 and @xmath113 possibly disjoint .",
    "the williamson type is a symplectic invariant .",
    "the aim of this article is to examine the asymptotic behavior of action - anglecoordinates when getting close to a singularity with one focus - focus component and no hyperbolic component .",
    "this question is actually motivated by a long - term program of classification of ihs based on their dynamical behaviour .",
    "while such classification for general systems is out of reach for now , partial results exists for subclasses of ihs . to formulate some of these results ,",
    "we introduce here a criterium called `` complexity '' .",
    "the notion of complexity find its origins in the works of karshon an tolman  @xcite@xcite@xcite , margaret symington and leung  @xcite , @xcite , and of san v ngcin  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath114 be an integrable hamiltonian system .",
    "it is said to be _ almost - toric _ of complexity @xmath115 if ( up to a global permutation of the components of @xmath5 ) , every critical point verifies these conditions :    * all critical points are non - degenerate .",
    "* there are no singularities of hyperbolic type : @xmath116 , * the function @xmath117 generates a _",
    "global _ @xmath118-action .",
    "an almost - toric system is called _ semi - toric _ if @xmath119 , and _ toric _ if @xmath120 . for a semi - toric system",
    ", @xmath121 is the map that generates the @xmath122-action .",
    "the classification of toric ihs begins with liouville arnold mineur theorem : the action - anglecoordinates provide an ( integral ) affine structure on the base space .",
    "it was shown in 1982 , simultaneously by atiyah  @xcite , and guillemin & sternberg  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , that for an hamiltonian @xmath123-action , the image of the moment map is a rational convex polytope in @xmath124 .",
    "delzant , in 1988 , gave a constructive proof that , in the completely integrable case @xmath125 , if the action is effective , the polytope completely determines the system , thus completing the classification for toric ihs @xcite @xcite .",
    "for the semi - toric case though , the image of moment map is not a polytope , and it is not enough to classify such ihs .",
    "however , san v ngcand pelayo use it to get a classification ``  la delzant '' for semi - toric systems in dimension @xmath13  @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . among the other classifying invariants they introduce ,",
    "there is a formal series that is explicited as the taylor expansion of regularized action coordinate , thus describing , in a way , how the lagrangian fibration pinches at a semi - toric singularity .",
    "the principal goal of this article is to give the general formula of this invariant , for any semi - toric critical point in any dimension .",
    "a semi - toric ihs only has elliptic critical points , which are well understood from the study of toric system , and critical points of williamson type @xmath126 . from  @xcite",
    "we know the set @xmath127 is a @xmath11-dimensional submanifold .",
    "we note @xmath128 the disk of dimension @xmath129 . in this article , we prove the following result .",

    ", we treat the general case with possible elliptic components .",
    "while it is quite intuitive , we shall define precisely the meaning of `` partial action - anglecoordinates '' in section  [ subsection : semi - global_theory ] . to prove this result , some genericity assumptions are necessary , which we shall indicate during the proof .",
    "this result was obtained during my ph.d .",
    "we present it here in the simplest manner , with the addition of the case wwith elliptic components",
    "the non - degeneracy condition we defined calls for an equivalent of the morse theory in the symplectic framework and integrable hamiltonian systems .",
    "we shall see that there are different level at which we can establish counterparts of classical results in morse theory .",
    "the first difference with classical morse theory is that instead of a single function , we have a family of @xmath8 real - functions .",
    "we exploit the relations between the functions to get a normal form theorem , due to eliasson .",
    "the version of the theorem given here is an extension of the original theorem which incorporates partial action - anglecoordinates for the transverse components .",
    "this version is due to miranda and zung  @xcite . also , we give the version only for semi - toric singularites    [ theo : eliasson_nf - st_case ] let @xmath148 a semi - toric integrable system with @xmath149 , @xmath5 an ihs .",

    "then there exists a triplet @xmath153 with @xmath154 an open neighborhoodof @xmath32 saturated with respect to the orbit @xmath155 of @xmath156 , @xmath157 a symplectomorphism of @xmath154 to a neighborhoodof @xmath158 that sends the orbit @xmath159 of @xmath32 to @xmath160 , and @xmath161 a local diffeomorphism of @xmath162 such that :    @xmath163    this is a counterpart of the morse lemma , here adapted to the symplectic context : in a neighborhoodof a non - degenerate critical point , an integrable system is , up to a regular change of coordinates , a function of of the quadratic parts determined by the williamson type of the critical point . as we said before , we have here @xmath11 action - anglecoordinates , thus allowing us to get a normal form on a `` wider '' open set .",
    "this is what one may call a semi - local , or an orbital result .",
    "it was the contribution of many people that allowed eventually the statement and proof of the original theorem of eliasson for fixed points .",
    "the first works to be cited here are those of birkhoff , vey  @xcite , colin de verdire and vey  @xcite , and of course eliasson in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "more recently , chaperon in  @xcite and  @xcite , zung in @xcite and  @xcite , and san v ngc & the author in  @xcite provided new proofs and filled the technical gaps that remained in the original proof .",
    "miranda and zung in @xcite , relying on eliasson local normal form provided the orbital version .",
    "eliasson normal form allows us to visualize the image of a neighborhoud of non - degenerate critical points .",
    "here is a picture of the different sets of critical values that can occur in dimension @xmath13 .",
    "a description of the lagrangian torus foliation near a semi - toric leaf starts with the study of the dynamic near the critical point . for each type of critical component",
    ", it is always possible to introduce a local model using complex coordinates . for elliptic and hyperbolic components ,",
    "we introduce natural complex coordinates established after darboux coordinates @xmath164 , along with their respective elliptic @xmath165 and hyperbolic @xmath166 hamiltonian . however , for focus - focus components we take the following 4-dimensional model :    @xmath167    we summarize in the array below some of the dynamical properties of each component .",
    ".properties of elementary blocks [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     note also that @xmath168 , which is here the complex counterpart to the hamiltonian , reminds of a hyperbolic singularity .",
    "this is why focus - focus critical points are also called `` complex hyperbolic '' or also `` loxodromic '' in the literrature .",
    "we give below a representation of the dynamic near an elliptic and a focus - focus critical point .",
    "for the elliptic case , the vector field @xmath169 is just the rotation around the critical point . for the focus - focus case",
    ", each vector field acts simultaneously on the two complex planes .",
    "the `` pseudo - hyperbolic '' field @xmath170 is along radial trajectories on each plane , that is , half - lines starting at the focus - focus critical point , while the `` pseudo - elliptic '' field @xmath171 is just the rotation around the focus - focus critical point . here is a picture of these two fields in dimension @xmath13 , with @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "our goal here is to formulate a version of the normal form for a critical leaf , and the foliation near it , that is , a liouville - arnold - mineur theorem for critical points .",
    "there are several problems we need to examine in order to be able to formulate the first problem is the following . in symplectic geometry , the orbit of a point @xmath32 by the @xmath174 action induced by the moment map is contained in the leaf that contains @xmath32 , and it is easy to see that each point of an orbit has the same williamson type . however , while for elliptic critical points the orbit is exactly the leaf , for hyperbolic and focus - focus critical points this is not the case . in the semi - toric case in dimension @xmath13 , for instance , the leaf containing the focus - focus point contains also points for which the action is of rank 2 ( in the local model , they are the points for which @xmath175 or @xmath176 is not zero ) .",
    "fortunately , in  @xcite , zung describes the stratification of a given leaf @xmath98 by the orbits of its points , and proves that all the orbits with lowest rank have the same williamson type , and it is thus an invariant of the leaf .",
    "this justifies definition  [ def : williamson_type_leaf ]    one important point also when we consider semi - toric leaves , is that a semi - toric leaf ( a leaf that contains a critical point with @xmath177 ) may carry more than one semi - toric orbit .",
    "we will not consider this case for the present time    from now on , for @xmath5 a semi - toric ihs , the leaves of @xmath5 will only carry at most one semi - toric orbit .    in order to expose arnold - liouville theorem for critical points ,",
    "we need some definitions .",
    "a ( non - degenerate ) _ singularity _ shall be defined as ( a germ of ) a tubular neighborhoodof a ( non - degenerate ) leaf .",
    "we adopt here the following notation : for @xmath178 in @xmath179 the base space of @xmath12 and @xmath180 the projection map , @xmath181 is the leaf of all points in @xmath33 over @xmath178 in the fibration , and @xmath182 a tubular neighborhoodof @xmath183 .",
