    "there has been a blossoming of literature on the features of systems exhibiting bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , triggered by its recent experimental realization@xcite .",
    "intially experiments with @xmath0 to @xmath1 atoms of rubidium or sodium ( later experiments have used lithium and eventually ( spin - polarized ) hydrogen ) , in harmonic or cigar shaped traps have demonstrated condensation to a `` pseudo - macroscopic '' level of occupancy of the ground state for @xmath2 temperatures .",
    "time of flight measurements , velocity distributions as well as spatial profiles have convincingly supported the physical picture of an abrupt transition in the behavior of the bose gas , which has been interpreted as the signature of bec .    following these experiments ,",
    "many theoretical studies were launched to characterize different aspects of bose condensates such as hydrodynamic modes@xcite , collective excitations@xcite , the behavior of ideal quantum fluids@xcite , the fraction of noncondensate vs. condensate atoms@xcite , or the generation and stability of vortices@xcite . in turn ,",
    "experimental studies have progressed to address some of the theoretical predictions@xcite and open up new questions .    here , we concern ourselves with one aspect of these quantum fluids , namely parametric driving . for the purpose of this report",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the framework of the mean - field or hartree - fock approximation .",
    "this approximation is rigorously justifiable only at @xmath3 but it is expected@xcite that the contribution of the non - condensate to the density is quite small .",
    "it is well - known that at this mean - field level the condensate wavefunction is governed by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp)@xcite equation .",
    "an issue addressed after the original experiments achieving the condensation was the study of collective excitations@xcite . in these papers",
    "these excitations were induced by a harmonic trap weakly modulated in time with appropriate types of symmetry .",
    "more recently , it was demonstrated that extended parametric resonances can occur@xcite in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) nls equation with a harmonic trap .",
    "this result may or may not ( for reasons to be explained below ) be relevant for two dimensional studies of bose gases",
    ". however , this naturally raises the question of whether a similar result can be deduced for the @xmath4 case which is certainly of direct relevance to experimental studies .",
    "the main question we will address is whether weak harmonic modulation of trapped @xmath4 condensates can cause an anomalously large response in their wavefunction .",
    "our answer , which will be in the affirmative , will be motivated by mathematical analysis using a moment method and verified by numerical simulation .",
    "we will briefly discuss the implications of these results and the suggestion of relevant experiments .",
    "considering a spherical trap , the dimensionless gp equation for the dynamics of the bec condensate is@xcite @xmath5 here , the subscript @xmath6 denotes time derivative and @xmath7 is a dimensionless parameter arising from the number @xmath8 of particles , the s - wave scattering length @xmath9 and from @xmath10 characterizing the strength of the trap ( see , ref . ) . in eq.([eq1 ] ) @xmath11 is a dimensionless function allowing for time dependence of the trap and @xmath12 , generalizes the equation to describe attractive ( @xmath13 as well as repulsive ( @xmath14 ) interactions . since , we restrict ourselves to spherical symmetry we only include the radial contribution in the laplace operator .",
    "although we are mainly interested in the full three - dimensional ( @xmath4 ) case we will in general consider the @xmath15-dimensional version of eq.([eq1 ] ) so that @xmath16 similarly to ref . , we define the following quantities @xmath17 where @xmath18 indexes the dimension .",
    "this type of nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation ( [ eq1 ] ) has two conserved quantities : as a result of the phase invariance the _ norm _ corresponding to @xmath19 is conserved in any dimension @xmath15 . also , since eq.([eq1 ] ) is a hamiltonian system arising from @xmath20 r^{d-1}dr \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this quantity is conserved .",
    "it is useful to note that the hamiltonian ( or more appropriately _ energy functional _ ) , @xmath21 , can be expressed in terms of the moments eqs.([eq3])-([eq6 ] ) @xmath22    the relevance of the moments eqs.([eq3])-([eq6 ] ) , is based on their time evolution and in the following we will derive the relations governing this dynamics . the physical rationale behind such an approach lies in the fact that the resulting equations can yield predictive diagnostics for the dynamics of the bec . in particular , @xmath23 will essentially yield the width of the spatial profile of the wavefunction .",
    "if a condensation phenomenon is to take place even when starting from a spatially uniform distribution ( at temperatures @xmath24 ) , the width must evolve towards a constant non - zero value .    using eq.([eq1 ] ) and its complex conjugate one can derive @xmath25 in deriving these we assume @xmath26 to vanish as @xmath27 .",
    "unfortunately , it is in general impossible to close this hierarchy of equations because the time derivative couples to the next order e.g. @xmath28 couples to @xmath29 and @xmath30 couples to @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and so on .",
    "however , combining eqs .",
    "( [ et ] ) and ( [ to ] ) provides some insight @xmath33.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] first , this confirms that the norm @xmath34 is conserved in any dimension .",
    "secondly , this relation clearly suggests @xmath35 as good choice since the term involving @xmath36 then vanishes irrespective of dimension .",
    "also , this choice allows the use of eq.([ham1 ] ) to reduce the expression ( [ reduced ] ) to @xmath37 which corresponds to the relation commonly referred to as the _ virial theorem_@xcite for the nonlinear schdinger without a trap , @xmath38 .    clearly , the @xmath39 case is special as the structure of eq.([virial ] ) is such that a closed time evolution can be prescribed .",
    "in addition , for time dependent modulation of the trap amplitude , we find ( as was observed for this problem in ref . and again in ref . ) a hill type equation which establishes parametric resonances for the behavior of the width ( or amplitude ) of the wavefunction .",
    "important as this conclusion about the @xmath39 behavior may be for general nls - gp equations , it is not clear that it is relevant to bec .",
    "since bec is not possible in spatial dimensions less that three ( @xmath40)@xcite where a kosterlitz - thouless topological transition seems to be occurring instead@xcite , the applicability of the gp equation for @xmath40 is controversial .",
    "our search for condensate instabilities is therefore most compelling in three dimensions where no such reservations exist .",
    "although eq.([virial ] ) is not closed in @xmath4 , it is easily seen that the following inequalities hold for @xmath41 @xmath42 where the equality applies to the two - dimensional case only ( and in fact for the noninteracting @xmath4 case @xmath43 ) .",
    "the value of these inequalities lies in the predictions about the 3d case@xcite . since we can resolve , or at least very well characterize , the 2d behavior , we are now able to extend this to quantitative predictions about of the 3d behavior . for the attractive case",
    "@xmath44 the possibility of collapse occurs as @xmath45 can become zero in finite time . in @xmath39 and due to eq.([ineq ] ) also in @xmath4 , a sufficient condition for collapse is @xmath46 , although , depending on the initial configurations , collapse can be achieved even for @xmath47 . a more complete discussion is given in ref .",
    "for the more realistic case ( in bec contexts ) of repulsive interaction @xmath48 we see for example that the parametric resonances that were demonstrated in the two - dimensional case@xcite will also be present in the three - dimensional case .",
    "so , for instance , for @xmath49 and @xmath50 will exhibit resonance around @xmath51 where the extent of the first resonance is determined by the inequality @xmath52@xcite .",
    "however , additional resonances may be possible in @xmath4 due to the nonlinear driving resulting from the repulsive interaction .",
    "some understanding of the influence of the last term in eq.([virial ] ) on the dynamics can be gained by assuming that the wavefunction can be approximated as    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is a shape - dependent constant .",
    "thus , assuming adiabatically the wavefunction does not alter its shape @xmath55 significantly as a result of the dynamics , @xmath26 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ shape ] ) automatically satisfies the norm conservation . utilizing this in eq.([virial ] ) yields @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are constants determined by the shape @xmath55 and the initial value of @xmath59 .",
    "clearly , the last term in eq.([bs ] ) will only influence the dynamics when @xmath59 becomes small . in the repulsive @xmath48 case",
    "however @xmath59 will generally not become small since there is no collapse .",
    "this simple analysis suggests that the parametric forcing of the experimentally realizable @xmath4 case will result in a resonance picture analogous to that previously reported for the @xmath39 problem .",
    "our numerical simulations of the full eq.([eq1 ] ) with @xmath11 as given above verifies the validity of this prediction .",
    "a typical example for @xmath60 , @xmath61 , ( i.e. @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 is given in fig.1 .",
    "the response of the wavefunction ( whose initial condition had @xmath64 ) , corresponding to the parametric resonance , can be observed directly from the wave function fig .",
    "1(a ) but even more clearly in the time evolution of @xmath65 , as shown in fig . 1(b ) .",
    "in this paper , we have presented and extended the formalism of the moment method , used in refs . and",
    "for the @xmath39 gp equations , to the more relevant @xmath4 case .",
    "we have commented on the special nature of the two - dimensional problem where the moment equations form a closed set of equations .",
    "we have also added a note of caution in considering the results of the gp analysis for @xmath66 .",
    "it might well be that , analogous to mean - field analysis in statistical physics systems , the `` critical dimension '' for this system is , indeed , @xmath67 and for lower dimensionalities the predictions of the mean - field theory are unreliable .",
    "a satisfactory self - consistent first principles description of an interacting boson gas for @xmath40 presents a very challenging theoretical problem , and it remains an unresolved issue whether a transition is present ( and if it is , what is its nature ) .    on the other hand , we have used the moment methods and have derived results for gp functionals in all dimensions of physical interest .",
    "considering , in particular , the @xmath4 case , where the validity of the gp approximation is clear , we have obtained a non - closed set of equations for the moments of the wavefunction .",
    "we have demonstrated that for a parametric time - disturbance of the trap amplitude , parametric resonances are possible . to date",
    "the experiments that have used parametric modulation have not observed such phenomena .",
    "these experiments have been performed in cigar - shaped traps ( where the analysis is considerably more complicated even in the @xmath39 problem@xcite ) .",
    "no fine tuning of frequencies and amplitudes was explored since the aim of the studies was to excite collective modes rather than to observe parametric resonances .",
    "hence , we propose an experiment in a spherical trap using weak harmonic modulation of the condensate .",
    "given the current experimental advances ( see e.g. ref . for a review ) , such an experiment seems feasible .",
    "such a study would , apart from the validation of the theoretical prediction , also explore how such resonances might destabilize the condensate .",
