    "after nearly a century s development , the theory of quantum mechanics has become an indispensable component of modern science with so many highly accurate experimental verifications of its theoretical predictions .",
    "it is well known that in quantum mechanics , in order to guarantee the conservation of probability and keep the energy eigenvalues real , the hamiltonian of a quantum system should be hermitian @xcite . to study the properties of a quantum system , we have to take into account of the interaction between the system and the environment .",
    "normally the system we treat is localized in space and the environment can be considered to be a measuring device .",
    "however , there is always a natural environment which is independent of any observer and exists at all times .",
    "a quantum system thus should be treated as an open system by including the environment it is embedded @xcite . under these circumstances , quantum mechanics with non - hermitian hamiltonians can provide an effective way to include the influences of the environment on the system we discuss .",
    "actually , many non - hermitian hamiltonians have been widely used to treat various problems in early days , such as free - electron lasers , transverse mode propagation in optical resonators and so on @xcite .",
    "non - hermitian quantum mechanics attracted much more attention when people found that a large class of non - hermitian hamiltonians can exhibit all real eigenvalues when these systems are @xmath0-symmetric @xcite .",
    "these @xmath0-symmetric non - hermitian systems are studied in many fields and have been experimentally realized in different physical systems in recent years @xcite .",
    "the growing interest in non - hermitian systems has motivated various discussions and extensions of the hermitian hamiltonians studied before , and have brought more and deep understandings about the quantum systems .",
    "recently , the topological properties of non - hermitian systems are investigated in @xcite .",
    "a non - hermitian tight - binding network engineering method is proposed in @xcite and it is shown that effective complex non - hermitian hopping rates can be realized with only complex onsite energies in the network . in @xcite ,",
    "the author studied the spectral and dynamical properties of a quantum particle constrained on non - hermitian quantum rings and found that very different behavior of particle motion showed up in the non - hermitian case .",
    "the scattering propagation and transport problems in non - hermitian systems have also been investigated and many interesting effects have been found @xcite .    in this work , we study the transport properties through a non - hermitian aharonov - bohm ( ab ) ring system as shown in fig .",
    "there are two quantum dots ( qds ) embedded in the two arms of the ring and the ring is attached to two metallic leads which are represented by two one - dimensional chains .",
    "the energy levels of these two qds can be complex in order to take into account of the physical gain or loss during the interacting processes between the ring and the environment . by allocating the flux phase factor induced by the magnetic flux threading through the ring into the tunneling amplitudes between the qds and the leads in different ways",
    ", the hamiltonian of the system would have different formalisms .",
    "we calculate the transmissions of the ab ring by using these hamiltonians of the same system and find that they are equal to each other .",
    "the transmission is not dependent on the way we distribute the phase factor , which is the same as in the hermitian case . besides ,",
    "by checking the conductance spectrum , we find that the asymmetric fano profile would show up by just tuning the physical gain and loss of the system . due to the interaction between the qds and the environment , the two channels through the ab ring will be broadened or narrowed down .",
    "electrons traversing these channels with different widths will interfere and result in fano effect in the conductance spectrum .",
    "this non - hermitian system provides us a simple model to check the influences of the environment on an otherwise isolated system .     and",
    "@xmath1 are the two qds embedded in the arms of the ring .",
    "the leads coupled to the ring are represented by two one - dimensional tight binding chains .",
    "@xmath2 is the magnetic flux threading through the ring.,width=288 ]    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the model hamiltonians of the system . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we calculate the transmissions through the ab ring according to the different hamiltonians we introduced and compare these results .",
    "we also investigate the fano profile in the conductance spectra of the system in this section .",
    "the last section ( sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] ) is dedicated to a brief summary .",
    "consider an aharonov - bohm ring with a impurity site or quantum dot at each arm of the ring , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . we can add some imaginary potentials to the two qds in the ring to represent the physical gain or loss during the interacting processes between the ring and the environment .",
    "the ab ring is also attached to two metallic leads which are represented by two one - dimensional chains .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system is @xmath3 where each part of @xmath4 is described as follows @xmath5 here , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the quantum dots implemented in the two arms of the ring with one single energy level @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . when @xmath10 and @xmath12 are both real , the hamiltonian is hermitian while if one or two of them are complex , the hamiltonian becomes non - hermitian .",
    "@xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the hopping amplitude between the nearest sites in the chain .",
    "@xmath17 is the tunneling amplitude between the qds and the lead @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the tunneling amplitudes can be complex due to the allocation of the phase factor which originates from the magnetic filed threading through the ring . due to gauge transformation ,",
    "these phase factors can be allocated differently and leads to different hamiltonians . in the hermitian case ,",
    "the physical variables will not be influenced by these differences , however , as we will show later , this physical picture also applies to this non - hermitian system .",
    "we will mainly consider two kinds of hamiltonians .",
    "one is symmetric with the phase factor distributed averagely to the four tunneling amplitudes @xmath20 however , the hamiltonian can also be written in an asymmetric form if the coupling strengths are chosen as @xmath21 we will calculate the transmissions through the aharonov - bohm ring with these two different hamiltonians and will compare the results with the hermitian system in the following .",
    "now we calculate the transmission rate through the non - hermitian ab ring with imaginary potentials .",
    "suppose that the wave function of the system can be written as the linear combination of atomic orbitals , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the probability amplitudes to find the electrons with momentum @xmath25 at the qd site @xmath26 in the ring arms or at site @xmath15 in the leads , respectively .",
    "assuming that there is an incoming electron from the left lead , and it is described by a plane wave which will be reflected and transmitted at the ab ring",
    ". then we have @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the reflection amplitude in the left lead and transmission amplitude from the left lead to the right lead , respectively . by substituting the wave function of the system into the schrdinger equation @xmath30 ,",
    "we have @xmath31 and @xmath32 let @xmath33 with @xmath34 being the energy dispersion of the one - dimensional chain .",
    "then we have @xmath35 after substituting these into the schrdinger equation , we can get the following equations    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    @xmath39    from eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) , we have @xmath40 , \\\\       a_{dk } & = \\frac{1}{a } t_0 [ -t_{ur } ( 1 + r_{ll } ) + t_{ul } \\tau_{rl } ] ,    \\end{split}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 defined as @xmath42 . substituting @xmath43 and @xmath44 into eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , we can get the transmission and reflection coefficient , which are shown as follows .",
    "@xmath45 ( e^{-2ik}-1 ) }    { a(t_{dl}^ * t_{ur}^*-t_{ul}^ * t_{dr}^ * ) - ( \\omega - e_u)e^{-ik } t_0 ( |t_{dl}|^2 + |t_{dr}|^2 ) - ( \\omega - e_d)e^{-ik } t_0 ( |t_{ur}|^2 + |t_{ul}|^2 ) - ( \\omega - e_u)(\\omega - e_d)e^{-2ik } t_0 ^ 2 }    \\end{split}\\ ] ]    and @xmath46 \\tau_{rl } }    { at_{ul}^ * + ( \\omega - e_u ) e^{-ik } t_0 t_{dr}}.\\ ] ] when the phase factor is averagely distributed to the four hopping amplitudes , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ symcase ] ) , @xmath47 , and the transmission coefficient becomes @xmath48 ( e^{-2ik } - 1 ) \\gamma }    { ( \\omega - e_u)(\\omega - e_d ) e^{-ik } + 2\\gamma(\\omega - e_u ) + 2 \\gamma ( \\omega - e_d ) + 4 \\gamma^2 e^{ik } \\sin^2 \\frac{\\phi}{2 } } \\ ] ] where @xmath49 .",
    "however , if the phase factor is distributed as in eq .",
    "( [ asymcase ] ) , then @xmath50 , and the transmission coefficient becomes @xmath51 ( e^{-2ik } - 1 ) \\gamma }    { ( \\omega - e_u)(\\omega - e_d ) e^{-ik } + 2\\gamma(\\omega - e_u ) + 2 \\gamma ( \\omega - e_d ) + 4 \\gamma^2 e^{ik } \\sin^2 \\frac{\\phi}{2 } } .\\ ] ] apparently , @xmath52 , so the transmissions through the ab ring system , which is defined as @xmath53 , will be the same for the different hamiltonians .",
    "the transmission can be expressed as @xmath54,\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the denominator of the transmission amplitude .",
    "so the transmission is not dependent on how we distribute the phase factors in the hamiltonian even when the system is non - hermitian .",
    "now , let s consider the non - hermitian cases with and without @xmath0-symmetry . if @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the hamiltonian is @xmath0-symmetric when the phase factor is written in the form in eq .",
    "( [ symcase ] ) , the transmission of the system is @xmath58 + 2\\cos \\phi ( \\omega - \\epsilon)^2 + 4\\gamma \\sin \\phi ( \\omega - \\epsilon ) - 2 \\gamma^2 \\cos \\phi   \\}.\\ ] ] however , if the hamiltonian is written in an form without @xmath0-symmetry , as in eq .",
    "( [ asymcase ] ) , the transmission of the system becomes @xmath59 + 2\\cos \\phi ( \\omega - \\epsilon)^2 + 4\\gamma \\sin \\phi ( \\omega - \\epsilon ) - 2 \\gamma^2 \\cos \\phi   \\},\\ ] ] with @xmath60 e^{-ik } + 4\\gamma(\\omega - \\epsilon ) + 4\\gamma^2 e^{ik } \\sin^2(\\phi/2)$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath61 , the transmissions calculated by using @xmath0-symmetric and -asymmetric hamiltonian are the same .    in fact ,",
    "if only one of the two qds is coupled by imaginary potential , namely only @xmath10 or @xmath12 is complex , the transmissions calculated by those different hamiltonians would also become equal with each other , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , though the hamiltonian can not be @xmath0-symmetric any more .",
    "so as long as there is imaginary potential added to the qds in the arms of the ab ring , the transmission of the system we get will not depend on the form of hamiltonian we write down .",
    "next let s investigate the conductance properties of the system .",
    "the conductance through the ab ring is defined as @xmath62 .",
    "here we mainly focus on the conductance at the fermi energy ( @xmath63 then @xmath64 ) and we have @xmath65 this is very similar to the expression in @xcite except that the energy levels of the qds are complex now . due to the coupling to the leads , the level of the qd will be broadened and the width is represented by @xmath66 . since @xmath10 and @xmath12 are complex , we can set @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 being real , then the width of the energy levels for the @xmath70 dot and the @xmath1 dot are @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "so if @xmath73 , these two levels will have different widths , one is broader and the other is relatively narrow",
    ". then there are two channels in this system , with appropriate parameters , the broader channel can be taken as a continuous background while the narrow one as a discrete resonant channel .",
    "electrons traversing through these two different channels will interfere with each other and lead to the asymmetric fano profile in the conductance spectra @xcite .",
    "we have supposed that the dots are symmetrically coupled to the leads , so the only way to differently change the widths of the two qd energy levels is by tuning @xmath74 , namely by tuning the physical gain or loss originating from the interaction between the qds and the environment .",
    "the situation becomes more clear when @xmath75 is positive while @xmath76 is negative , since then one of the energy level will be broadened while the other will be narrowed down , thus the interferences of electrons traveling through these two channels will make the fano profile more significant .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we present the conductance spectra of the ab ring system with different physical gain and loss . we take @xmath77 as the energy unit and set @xmath78 throughout this paper . when there is no physical gain or loss in the system , the conductance spectra are always symmetric ( fig . [ fig2](a ) ) . when @xmath73 , as shown by the red dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , the asymmetric fano lineshape shows up when @xmath79 . the fano profile becomes more sharp when the difference between @xmath75 and @xmath76 gets larger . besides , there is a dip when @xmath80 , which is denoted by the blue solid line and the dip will reach to zero when @xmath81 ( see fig . [ fig2](d ) ) . when @xmath82 , the conductance keeps the symmetric lorentzian shape ( or zero ) in situations with ( or without ) physical gain and loss , as represented by the black dot - dashed line in the figure .",
    "( blue solid curve ) , @xmath83 ( red dashed curve ) and @xmath82 ( black dot - dashed curve ) . , width=288 ]    actually , if we choose @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which corresponds to a situation with balanced physical gain and loss in these two qds . then the conductance of the system becomes @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "this is very similar to the standard formula for fano resonance profile which is defined as @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the asymmetric parameter .",
    "we can simply take @xmath90 in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) .",
    "when @xmath80 , @xmath91 , the conductance profile is symmetric and there is a dip down to zero , as shown by the blue solid line in fig . [ fig2](d ) .",
    "when @xmath82 , @xmath92 , the conductance shows the standard symmetric lorentzian type , like the black dot - dashed curve shows . when @xmath83 , we have @xmath93 , and we have the asymmetric fano profile and the dip shows up at @xmath94 , just as the red dashed line indicates . though we do not normalize the conductance , all the characteristics revealed in the conductance spectrum of our system are consistent with the standard fano profiles .",
    "the difference about this non - hermitian system is that the broadened width of the qd energy level and thus the width of the channel are controlled by the physical gain and loss of the system .",
    "so the influences of the environment are directly reflected in the behavior of the conductance spectrum .",
    "another aspect needs to be noticed is that the maximum of the conductance will exceed @xmath95 when the @xmath69 becomes large , which denotes that the probability is not conserved in this system due to the non - hermiticity .",
    "we investigate a non - hermitian aharonov - bohm ring system in which the energy level of the two embedded quantum dots ( qds ) in the two arms of the ring could be complex .",
    "the complex energy level represents the physical gain or loss during the interacting process between the ab ring and the environment . due to the magnetic flux threading through the ring",
    ", the hamiltonian of this model can be written in different forms by differently distributing the phase factor inducing by the magnetic field to the hopping amplitudes between the qds and the leads .",
    "we calculate the transmission through the ab ring using these different hamiltonians , including @xmath0-symmetric and -asymmetric cases , and find that it is not dependent on the way we distribute the phase factor in the hamiltonian , which is the same as in the hermitian case .",
    "more importantly , by checking the conductance spectrum , we find that the asymmetric fano profile can show up by just tuning the physical gain and loss of the system",
    ". the interaction between the qds and the environment will broaden or narrow down the two channels through the ring and electrons traveling through different channels will interfere and result in fano effect .",
    "so the influence of the environment is revealed in the transport properties of the system .",
    "this non - hermitian aharonov - bohm ring system we discussed in this paper provides a simple model to check the influence of the environment on an otherwise isolated system and a demonstration of the basic principles of quantum mechanics .",
