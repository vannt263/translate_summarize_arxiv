    "large - distance qcd remains an area , where the concepts of perturbation theory can not be directly applied . to assess this region and make reliable predictions for hadronic processes , the pure perturbative treatment has to be amended by nonperturbative input .    in a series of recent papers @xcite ,",
    "three of us have outlined an approach , based on qcd sum rules with nonlocal condensates @xcite , capable of providing a pion distribution amplitude ( da ) compatible at @xmath2 with the cleo data @xcite on the pion - photon transition .",
    "the key feature of this pion da is that its endpoint regions @xmath3 ( @xmath4 being the parton s longitudinal momentum fraction ) are strongly suppressed .",
    "this suppression is controlled by the nonlocality of the scalar quark condensate , parameterized by the average quark virtuality @xmath5 in the vacuum , with theoretical estimates in the range @xmath6 @xcite and a preferable value of @xmath7  gev@xmath8 extracted in @xcite from the cleo data .",
    "in addition , one can improve the quality of perturbatively calculable observables , notably the factorized hard contribution of the pion s electromagnetic form factor , by trading the traditional power - series perturbative expansion for a non - power - series ( in an analytic ) coupling expansion that avoids _ eo ipso _ the landau singularity rendering all expressions infrared ( ir ) finite @xcite .",
    "suffice it here to say that this is achieved through the inclusion into the running coupling of a power - behaved term of nonperturbative origin that removes the landau ghost leaving the ultraviolet behavior of the effective coupling unchanged .",
    "crucial for making this analytic approach possible , is the generalization of the analytic running - coupling concept , proposed by shirkov and solovtsov @xcite , to the level of observables depending on more than one scheme scales @xcite , as is , for example , the case for the pion form factor in fixed - order perturbation theory beyond lo @xcite , or performing a sudakov resummation @xcite .",
    "along these lines of thoughts , we describe in this contribution our recent works on the pion da , summarizing the main results , and present predictions for the pion s electromagnetic form factor carried out under the imposition of analyticity of the running coupling and its powers using two different procedures .",
    "it turns out that if the powers of the coupling have their own analytic ( dispersive ) images , the factorizable hard part of the form factor so calculated bears a minimal dependence on the scheme and scale - setting choice .",
    "including also the soft contribution via local duality , this helps improving the quality of the prediction beyond the level of the current experimental - data accuracy .",
    "in the context of factorization of hard exclusive processes @xcite , the pion da is a universal , gauge - invariant quantity defined at the twist-2 level by @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11  mev is the pion decay constant , and @xmath12 $ ] preserves gauge invariance .",
    "@xmath13 encapsulates the nonperturbative qcd pion structure in terms of the distribution of the longitudinal momentum fractions between its two valence partons : quark ( @xmath4 ) and antiquark ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "together with the da of its first resonance , @xmath15 , it can be related to the nonlocal condensates by means of a sum rule , based on the correlator of two axial currents ( see @xcite ) . due to the finiteness of the vacuum correlation length @xmath16",
    ", the end - point regions @xmath17 are strongly suppressed and by virtue of this fact we can @xcite determine quite accurately the first ten moments @xmath18 of the pion da and _ independently _ also the inverse moment @xmath19 . given that @xmath20 rapidly with increasing @xmath21 , the eigenfunctions decomposition @xmath22 \\label{eq : phi024mu0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] can be practically truncated at @xmath23 because all higher coefficients are negligible @xcite .",

    "let us close this section with a forward - looking statement : the bms `` bunch '' pion das , though doubly peaked , have their endpoints ( @xmath30 ) strongly suppressed  not only relative to @xmath31 but even compared to @xmath32 , substantially reducing the importance of sudakov effects .",

    "the crucial new elements of the calculation below are : ( i ) use of the bms pion da , ( ii ) application of two - loop analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) , and ( iii ) a more accurate way , based on local duality , to join the soft part with the hard form - factor contribution .",
    "the pion s electromagnetic form factor can be generically written as @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the factorized part within pqcd and @xmath59 is the `` soft '' part containing subleading power - behaved ( e.g. , twist-4 ) contributions originating from nonperturbative effects .",

    "the effects of the lo da evolution are crucial @xcite , while the nlo ones are relatively of less importance .",
