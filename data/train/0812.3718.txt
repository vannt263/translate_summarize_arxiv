    "actual experiments in ultracold physics open the possibility of trapping and cooling atomic mixtures composed of different atomic species @xcite in quasi two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) geometries @xcite .",
    "this dramatic progress opens exciting possibilities for exploring experimentally few- and many - body properties in these systems .",
    "for example , the berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless transition in bosonic 2d gases is under active experimental studies @xcite .",
    "the occurence of confinement induced resonances @xcite _ i.e. _ for quasi-2d wave guide , resonances in two - body scattering induced by the transverse confinement , is another peculiar property in these systems which represents a way to achieve strongly correlated regimes . there are also promising possibilities using fermionic quasi-2d gas to reach exotic phases @xcite .",
    "more recently , a new crystalline order has been predicted to occur for two - species quasi-2d fermionic gases with a sufficiently large mass ratio @xcite .",
    "this last reference suggests also the idea of tuning the mass ratio by imposing an optical lattice acting on one species only .",
    "this opens fascinating possibilities for achieving systems with very high mass ratio .    motivated by these recent progress , we consider in this paper mixtures of two atomic species `` strongly confined '' along the @xmath0-direction by a planar atomic wave guide of frequency @xmath1 , without any external confinement along the @xmath2 and @xmath3 directions . here , the expression `` strongly confined '' means that for large interparticle separations ( _ i.e. _ for distances which are very much larger than the transverse harmonic oscillator length denoted @xmath4 ) , atoms are frozen in the ground state of the 1d harmonic oscillator along @xmath0 . in this situation , the system can be considered quasi-2d and long range properties ( for interparticle distances very much larger than @xmath4 ) acquire the peculiar aspects typical of a 2d - world .",
    "the results of the paper can be summarized as follows : ( i ) we extend the formulation of the 2d zero - range potential ( zrp ) approach which is usually used in the configurational space @xcite to the momentum representation which is more natural for a translation invariant problem . this way the equivalence between the zrp model and the diagrammatic @xcite or the @xmath5-matrix approaches @xcite is much more transparent .",
    "( ii ) we predict the existence of `` @xmath6-body '' universal shallow bound states composed of two identical atoms of mass @xmath7 and of a third atom : an `` impurity '' of mass @xmath8 .",
    "there is no interaction between the two identical atoms of mass @xmath7 while each one interacts ( in the @xmath9-wave channel only ) with the impurity . for each statistics ,",
    "the bound states are labeled by a radial quantum number and an internal angular momentum .",
    "this latter one is even when identical atoms are bosons and odd when they are fermions .",
    "the binding energies are function of the two - body scattering length , of the oscillator length and of the mass ratio , thus they can be tuned by various ways . if the two identical atoms obey the fermi statistics , we find that for increasing values of the mass ratio @xmath10 , the first trimer appears at @xmath11 for a @xmath12-wave internal angular momentum .",
    "( iii ) neglecting inelastic processes toward deep molecular bound states with spatial extensions of the order of the range of interatomic forces ( which is very much smaller than @xmath13 ) , the low energy two - body collisions between 2d shallow heteronuclear dimers composed of fermions are elastic for a mass ratio @xmath14 .",
    "( @xmath15 ) in the case where identical atoms are bosons , at least one trimer exists for all values of the mass ratio .",
    "moreover , binary collisions for dimers composed at least of one boson can always populate a shallow trimer state .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we recall the low energy two - body scattering properties for atoms strongly confined in a 2d plane by a harmonic trap along the third dimension .",
    "we then introduce the zrp model in the momentum representation , where the contact condition for a vanishing distance between interacting particles is replaced by an integral equation . in the sec .",
    "iii , we explain how this formulation can be extended to few - body problems . in sec .",
    "iv , we show that depending on the various parameters ( statistics , mass ratio , 2d - scattering length ) the three - body wave equation can support one or more bound - states .",
    "we then discuss about the implications of these findings .",
    "in particular we focus on the stability issue for the quasi-2d heteronuclear dimer gas .",
    "in this section , we introduce the zrp model in the momentum space .",
    "we then consider a system composed of two interacting particles of respective masses @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( with the reduced mass @xmath16 ) interacting in the @xmath9-wave channel only .",
    "the particles are trapped by a harmonic potential along the @xmath0-axis with the same trap frequency ( @xmath1 ) for both species .",
    "we then define the harmonic oscillator length as : @xmath17 according to the `` strong 2d confinement '' hypothesis , we suppose that for large interparticle separations ( very much larger than @xmath4 ) , the wavefunction factorizes in the product of a wavefunction of the 2d coordinates ( 2d - wave function ) and of two ground state eigenfunctions of the 1d - harmonic trap for each atomic @xmath0-coordinate . in what follows , @xmath4 represents a short range scale ( in the 2d - world , this length is formally equivalent to the range of the true interatomic forces in three dimensions ) and we consider only the quasi-2d behavior : atomic momenta and positions are in the 2d @xmath18 plane .",
    "the two - body scattering states for an incident plane wave of wave vector @xmath19 are given in the low energy regime ( @xmath20 ) by : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the 2d scattering amplitude @xcite : @xmath23 in eq .",

    "the interacting wavefunction is obtained by determining the balance between these two functions _",
    "i.e. _ by choosing a specific value for the source amplitude @xmath33 . in the present case and",
    "analogously to what happens for point - charge in 2d - electrostatic , the source term leads to a logarithmic singularity for vanishing interparticle separations @xmath35 .",
    "the correct balance between the singular and the regular contributions is deduced by imposing the following behavior on the wave - function as @xmath36 @xcite : @xmath37 this contact condition allows one to recover the scattering states in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2dscatt ] ) exactly .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the logarithmic singularity is purely formal because for @xmath38 of the order or smaller than @xmath4 , the 2d zero range model ceases to be valid and 3d physics becomes important .",
    "however , this is the key property which permits to implement the effect of the interaction for interparticle separations very much larger than @xmath4 .",
    "the systems which are studied in this paper are translationally invariant along the @xmath18 plane .",
    "hence , solving the stationnary schrdinger equation is a much more simple task in the @xmath39-representation than in the configurational space .",
