    "a rapidly rotating protoneutron star are produced by a core collapse supernova , accretion - induced collapse white dwarf .",
    "they can be subject to well - known non - axisymmetric instabilities ( @xcite ) .",
    "stellar deformations caused by rotation and the non - axisymmetric instabilities can generate strong gravitational wave signals , with the global @xmath3 instabilities particularly related to gravitational wave production .",
    "thus , a rapidly rotating protoneutron star is a good source of gravitational radiation .",
    "the development of non - axisymmetric instabilities is characterized by the energy ratio @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the rotational energy and @xmath6 is the gravitational potential energy of the rotating star .",
    "studies of these instabilities were obtained in the nineteenth century ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "uniformly rotating incompressible fluids exhibit the @xmath3 f - mode dynamical instability when the value of @xmath7 satisfies the threshold @xmath8 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , there exists a secular instability which is driven by dissipative processes , such as viscosity and gravitational radiation , which grows when the value of @xmath7 is larger than 0.14 ( see also numerical calculations by @xcite ) .",
    "this threshold is easier to satisfy than the threshold for dynamical bar - mode instability , but the growth time - scale is much longer because the typical time - scale of the dissipation process is much larger than that of a dynamical time - scale ( @xcite ) .",
    "the instability situation changes if we introduce sufficiently large differential rotation .",
    "the linear analysis of a rapidly rotating star by @xcite showed that the threshold of the dynamical instability decreases when the degree of the differential rotation is sufficiently large .",
    "many numerical simulations have confirmed that @xmath9 or @xmath3 non - axisymmetric instabilities can appear at a much lower @xmath7 than 0.27 if a sufficiently large differential rotation is present ( for example , @xmath10 in @xcite ) .",
    "this non - axisymmetric instability is referred to as low-@xmath2 instability , and it can occur even for @xmath11 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . although numerical simulations have shown their existence , the physical origin of low-@xmath2 instabilities remains unclear .",
    "the instabilities are associated with the presence of a corotation resonance point inside the star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the wave pattern speed of an unstable mode equals the local background fluid rotational velocity at the point .",
    "corotation resonance has long been known to be a key factor for instabilities in various astrophysical contexts , such as the corotational instabilities for thin accretion discs , the spiral pattern in galaxies ( @xcite ) , and the papaloizou - pringle instability for accretion tori ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . by performing time evolutions of linear perturbations of differential rotating stars",
    ", @xcite recently found that the @xmath12 f - mode becomes unstable as soon as a corotation point develops inside the star .",
    "the low-@xmath2 instabilities are thus a subclass of local shear instabilities .",
    "the effect of magnetic fields is a significant issue concerning these instabilities .",
    "many numerical simulations have shown that low-@xmath2 instability may develop in some proto - neutron stars with rapid rotation during stellar core - collapses ( @xcite ; @xcite ) because of their sufficiently large differential rotations .",
    "on the other hand , recent magnetohydrodynamical simulations have shown that the dynamical bar - mode instability can be suppressed by magnetic force ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . since large toroidal fields can be wound up from an initial poloidal magnetic field by differential rotation and amplified by magneto - rotational - instabilities ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , rapidly rotating proto - neutron stars are expected to have large toroidal magnetic fields , which would suppress the low-@xmath2 instability .",
    "contrasting with the many numerical simulation studies , @xcite investigated the effect of a purely toroidal magnetic field on the low-@xmath2 instability by applying linear analysis to a cylindrical star with a simple model of the toroidal magnetic field ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . they found that the toroidal magnetic field suppresses the low-@xmath2 instability when the total toroidal magnetic energy @xmath13 is in the order of 0.2 @xmath5 or larger .",
    "such magnetic energy corresponds to toroidal fields of a few @xmath14 g in their magnetic field model .",
    "this study also found that the corotation point is split into two slow magnetosonic resonances in the presence of strong toroidal fields .",
    "therefore , the unstable mode in the presence of the toroidal field is determined by both corotation and slow magnetosonic resonances inside the magnetized star .",
    "very recently , however , @xcite performed accurate general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations and found that the low-@xmath2 instability would be suppressed by a weaker magnetic field energy than given in @xcite .",
    "in their simulation models , the large toroidal magnetic field ( @xmath15 g ) is wound up from the initial poloidal field ( @xmath16 g ) by differential rotation . since the toroidal magnetic fields are wound up in their models , the distributions of the toroidal magnetic field are determined by the profile of the differential rotation .",
    "the distributions of the toroidal magnetic fields are different from the simple model used in @xcite .",
    "the maximum strength of the local toroidal magnetic field reached approximately @xmath17 g in their simulations , but the total magnetic energy peaked at @xmath18 of the kinetic energy @xmath5 .",
    "although this energy ratio ( @xmath19 ) is much smaller than that in @xcite ( @xmath20 ) , the low-@xmath2 instability was stabilized by the toroidal magnetic fields in their simulation models .",
    "they also showed that slow magnetosonic resonances appear in their simulation models ( fig .",
    "10 in their paper ) .",
    "this result shows that both the total magnetic energy and the structure of the toroidal field are important for suppression by magnetic fields because low-@xmath2 instabilities significantly depend on the values of the local rotational velocity ( degree of the differential rotation ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , however , calculated only one simple toroidal magnetic field model which did not represent the wound magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we must consider various toroidal magnetic fields in order to study the linear analysis and address the suppression systematically .",
    "although many equilibrium states with purely toroidal magnetic fields have been consistently obtained in both newtonian ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and general relativistic ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) frameworks , all of their toroidal magnetic field configurations are essentially same - class solutions .",
    "when we calculate a stationary axisymmetric and barotropic rotating star with purely toroidal magnetic fields , we obtain two arbitrary functions from the integrability condition of the magnetohydrodynamic equation that are related to the rotation law of the angular velocity and the distribution of the toroidal magnetic field . rotating equilibrium states",
    "have been studied and many rotation laws have been investigated in both newtonian and general relativistic frameworks ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in contrast",
    ", only a few works have studied purely toroidal magnetized equilibrium states , almost all previous works have employed only a simple functional form ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the functional form of a toroidal magnetic field is considered _ rigid _ in analogy to the rotation law . although a _ rigid _",
    "toroidal field is simple and widely accepted , the distributions of the toroidal field do not represent those wound up by differential rotation .",
    "thus , we need to construct a _ differential _ toroidal magnetic field which represents magnetic winding by differential rotation and to treat the linear analysis and the suppression more systematically . as a first step",
    ", this paper investigate new functional forms of a _ differential _ field and obtains new solutions of purely toroidal magnetized equilibria .",
    "these solutions will be useful for equilibrium models for linear analysis .",

    "we present results from numerical calculations .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "we employed the formulation developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will first briefly summarize the formulation below while the remainder of the section focuses on explaining the new functional forms in detail . both cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and spherical coordinates ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath22 )",
    "are utilized in this paper .      as per previous works",
    ", we make the following assumptions for magnetized stars .    1 .",
    "the system is in a stationary state , i.e. @xmath26 .",
    "2 .   the rotational axis and magnetic axis coincide .",
    "the configuration is axisymmetric about the rotational axis , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "4 .   there are no meridional flows or poloidal magnetic fields , i.e. the magnetic field is purely toroidal .",
    "the star is self - gravitating .",
    "the system is treated in the framework of non - relativistic physics .",
    "no electric current is assumed in the vacuum region .",
    "there is no current sheet , i.e. the magnetic field continues smoothly .",
    "the barotropic equation of state is assumed .",
    "these assumptions are adopted here for simplicity . for a barotropic equation of state",
    ", we use a polytropic equation of state @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the gas pressure and the density , respectively , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constants .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the equations that describe this system are the euler equations @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 the integral form of the poisson equation @xmath36 and stationary maxwell s equations , @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are , respectively , the gravitational potential , the toroidal velocity , the current density , the speed of light , the toroidal magnetic field , the gravitational constant , and the electric field",
    ". using these equations , we obtain the first integral of the euler equation ( see e.g. , @xcite ) as @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an integral constant , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the rotational potential and the magnetic potential respectively . @xmath53 and @xmath54 are arbitrary functions of @xmath21 and @xmath55 , respectively , and @xmath55 is a scalar function defined by @xmath56 .",
    "these arbitrary functions are related to the toroidal velocity and the toroidal magnetic field according to @xmath57 @xmath58 therefore , there appears to be two arbitrary functions when we calculate a rotating star with a purely toroidal magnetic field .",
    "note that we can choose any kind of functional forms of these potentials respectively under the assumption of no poloidal magnetic field and no meridional flow , because the toroidal magnetic field does not produce a force that acts directly onto the rotation and the rotation does not change the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "we can obtain one rotating magnetized equilibrium solution by fixing these two functional forms .",
    "the arbitrary function @xmath59 corresponds to the rotation law of the rotating star .",
    "we can obtain various differential rotating stars by changing the functional form of @xmath59 . on the other hand , the physical meaning of",
    "the arbitrary function @xmath60 is less clear . in all previous works ,",
    "a simple functional form was adopted with no investigation of new functional forms that express various toroidal magnetic fields such as differential rotations .",
    "this paper discusses new functional forms of @xmath60 that correspond to the toroidal magnetic field wound up by the differential rotation .",
    "first , we will review functional forms of @xmath59 and discuss the rotation laws .",
    "the following three types of rotation law are usually used ( see e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "rigid rotation : @xmath61 2 .",
    "@xmath0-constant rotation : @xmath62 3 .",

    "as @xmath67 decreases towards zero , the latter two rotation laws approach the true rotation denoted by their respective names .",
    "that is , @xmath41 becomes strictly constant in space for the second law ( @xmath0-constant rotation ) and the specific angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath68 , becomes exactly constant in space for the third law ( @xmath1-constant rotation ) . for these cases , we can obtain the explicit forms of the rotational potentials as follows .    1 .   for rigid rotation",
    ": @xmath69 2 .   for @xmath0-constant rotation : @xmath70 3 .   for @xmath1-constant rotation : @xmath71    these types of rotation laws have also been studied in general relativistic frameworks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite studied rotation laws systematically and obtained a new functional form , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are constants .",
    "we can invoke a wide range of rotation laws by changing the value of @xmath74 ( @xcite ) .",
    "almost all works concerning the low-@xmath2 instability have applied the @xmath1-constant functional form for differential rotations of initial models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , only the following simple power - law type functional form of @xmath60 has been adopted in previous works ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a constant .",
    "since we have assumed that the magnetic field continues smoothly , the regularity of the toroidal magnetic field is required .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 must be @xmath77 , because the functional form with @xmath77 satisfies the regularity condition at the centre ( @xmath78 , @xmath79 ) .",
    "we can derive the magnetic potential using this power - law functional form as @xmath80 as we have seen , the exponents of the rotational potential are @xmath81 ( rigid ) , @xmath82 ( @xmath0-constant ) , and @xmath83 ( @xmath1-constant ) .",
    "the exponents of rotational potentials of the differential rotations are negative , while that of rigid rotation is positive .",
    "the exponent of the rotational potential characterize the rotation law . on the other hand ,",
    "the magnetic potential becomes @xmath84 when the star is incompressible ( @xcite ) .",
    "since @xmath76 is limited to @xmath77 by the boundary condition , the exponent of this magnetic potential is always positive .",
    "therefore , we consider this functional form of magnetic potential as a _ rigid _ toroidal magnetic field in analogy to the rotation law .    if the toroidal magnetic field is wound up from the initial poloidal fields by the differential rotations , the distribution of the toroidal magnetic field is determined by the profile of this differential rotation .",
    "if we neglect the meridional flow , the evolution of the toroidal magnetic field is described by the following induction equation : @xmath85 if the initial magnetic field is purely poloidal ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath86 only has a constant @xmath21-component ( @xmath87 ) , the poloidal field is wound up by the differential rotation and the profiles of the toroidal magnetic field become @xmath88 therefore , the toroidal magnetic field wound up by the differential rotation must satisfy the magnetic winding in equation ( [ eq : bt_wound ] ) , but we have not obtained such toroidal magnetic field distributions by using a _ rigid _ toroidal field ( equation [ eq : bt_rigid ] ) . since the rotation and the toroidal magnetic field are not necessarily consistent with each other under the assumption of no meridional flow and no poloidal magnetic field , we can select the functional forms of @xmath54 that are most compatible with the chosen rotational potential .    here ,",
    "we introduce two new functional forms of @xmath60 whose toroidal magnetic fields satisfy equation ( [ eq : bt_wound ] ) .",
    "we call the functional forms _ differential _ toroidal fields in analogy to rotation law and rotational potentials . the functional form of a type 1 _ differential _ toroidal field is @xmath89 and the functional form of a type 2 _ differential _ toroidal field is @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a constant .",
    "@xmath91 represents the degree of the _ differential _ toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic potentials of these functions are @xmath92 for a type 1 _ differential _ magnetic potential and @xmath93 for a type 2 _ differential _ magnetic potential .",
    "since the exponents of these _ differential _ magnetic potentials are @xmath94 in type 1 and @xmath95 in type 2 , we can obtain a wide range of the distributions of the toroidal magnetic field using these functional forms , including distributions which meet the condition of equation ( [ eq : bt_wound ] ) ( see the profiles of toroidal magnetic fields in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ) .      following previous works ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we adopted hachisu s self - consistent scheme ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is a very powerful numerical scheme for obtaining a rotating star in equilibrium . in this scheme ,",

    "[ fig : bt_r ] , the location of the maximum point approaches the centre as the value of @xmath126 decreases .",

    "<S> we have succeeded in obtaining magnetized equilibrium states with differential rotation and _ differential _ toroidal magnetic fields . if an internal toroidal field of a protoneutron star is wound up from the initial poloidal magnetic field by differential rotation , the distribution of the toroidal magnetic field is determined by the profile of this differential rotation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the distributions of the toroidal fields in all previous magnetized equilibrium studies do not represent the magnetic winding by the differential rotation of the star . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate a formulation of a _ differential _ toroidal magnetic field that represents the magnetic field wound up by differential rotation . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed two functional forms of _ differential _ toroidal fields which correspond to a @xmath0-constant and a @xmath1-constant field in analogy to differential rotations . </S>",
    "<S> as the degree of the _ differential _ becomes very high , the toroidal magnetic field becomes highly localized and concentrated near the rotational axis . </S>",
    "<S> such a _ differential _ toroidal magnetic field would suppress the low-@xmath2 instability more efficiently even if the total magnetic field energy is much smaller than that of a non-_differential _ toroidal magnetic field .    </S>",
