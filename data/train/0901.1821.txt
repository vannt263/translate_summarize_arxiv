    "semidefinite programming , a versatile extension of linear programming to the convex cone of positive semidefinite matrices ( semidefinite cone for short ) , has found many applications in various areas of applied mathematics and engineering , especially in combinatorial optimization , structural mechanics and systems control .",
    "for example , semidefinite programming was used in @xcite to derive linear matrix inequality ( lmi ) convex inner approximations of the non - convex semi - algebraic stability region , and in @xcite to derive a hierarchy of embedded convex lmi outer approximations of non - convex semi - algebraic sets arising in control problems .",
    "it is easy to prove that affine sections and projections of the semidefinite cone are convex semi - algebraic sets , but it is still unknown whether all convex semi - algebraic sets can be modeled like this , or in other words , whether all convex semi - algebraic sets are semidefinite representable . following the development of polynomial - time interior - point algorithms to solve semidefinite programs , a long list of semidefinite representable semi - algebraic sets and convex hulls was initiated in @xcite and completed in @xcite .",
    "latest achievements in the field are reported in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we aim at enlarging the class of semi - algebraic sets whose convex hulls are explicitly semidefinite representable . using elementary duality properties of positive semidefinite moment matrices and polynomial sum - of - squares decompositions  nicely recently surveyed in @xcite  we prove that the convex hull of rationally parameterized algebraic varieties is explicitly semidefinite representable in the case of ( a ) curves ; ( b ) hypersurfaces parameterized by quadratics ; and ( c ) hypersurfaces parameterized by bivariate quartics ; all in an ambient space of arbitrary dimension .",
    "rationally parameterized surfaces arise often in engineering , and especially in computer - aided design ( cad ) .",
    "for example , the catia ( computer aided three - dimensional interactive application ) software , developed since 1981 by the french company dassault systmes , uses rationally parameterized surfaces as its core 3d surface representation .",
    "catia was originally used to develop dassault s mirage fighter jet for the french airforce , and then it was adopted in aerospace , automotive , shipbuilding , and other industries .",
    "for example , airbus aircrafts are designed in toulouse with the help of catia , and architect frank gehry has used the software to design his curvilinear buildings , like the guggenheim museum in bilbao or the dancing house in prague , near the charles square buildings of the czech technical university .",

    "finally , given a set @xmath34 , let @xmath35 denote its convex hull , the smallest convex set containing @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37    [ zeta ] if @xmath38 or @xmath39 or @xmath40 then @xmath41 .    * proof * : the inclusion @xmath42 follows from the definition of a moment matrix since @xmath43 the converse inclusion is shown by contradiction .",
    "assume that @xmath44 and hence that there exists a ( strictly separating ) hyperplane @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 for all @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that polynomial @xmath49 is globally non - negative . since @xmath38 or @xmath39 or @xmath40 , the polynomial can be expressed as a sum of squares of polynomials ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.4 ) and we can write @xmath50 for some matrix @xmath51 . then @xmath52 .",

    "if we use affine spaces , theorem [ zeta ] is not correct in this form . indeed , when @xmath38 and @xmath29 , the sequence @xmath59 $ ] belongs to @xmath60 but not to @xmath61 , as recalled in (",

    "it would be interesting to design an algorithm simplifying a given semidefinite representation , lowering the size of the matrix and the number of variables .",
    "as far as we know , no such algorithm exists at this date .",
    "the well - known equivalence between polynomial non - negativity and existence of a sum - of - squares decomposition was used , jointly with semidefinite programming duality , to identify the cases for which the convex hull of a rationally parameterized variety is exactly semidefinite representable . practically speaking",
    ", this means that optimization of a linear function over such varieties is equivalent to semidefinite programming , at the price of introducing a certain number of lifting variables .    if the problem of detecting whether a plane algebraic curve is rationally parameterizable , and finding explicitly such a parametrization , is reasonably well understood from the theoretical and numerical point of view ",
    "see @xcite and m. van hoeij s algcurves maple package for an implementation  the case of surfaces is much more difficult @xcite .",
    "up to our knowledge , there is currently no working computer implementation of a parametrization algorithm for surfaces . since an explicit parametrization is required for an explicit semidefinite representation of the convex hull of varieties , the general case of algebraic varieties given in implicit form ( i.e. as a polynomial equation ) , remains largely open .",
    "finally , we expect that these semidefinite representability results may have applications when studying non - convex semi - algebraic sets and varieties arising from stability conditions in systems control , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "these developments are however out of the scope of the present paper .",
