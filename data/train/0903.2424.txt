    "tests of gravitational theories in the strong - field regime are extremely important because , unlike the weak - field , they are still largely unconstrained by observations . however , with developing technology , it is becoming possible to observe compact objects with high accuracy .",
    "for example , observations of emitted x - rays and @xmath0-rays from compact objects could be used to directly test the strong - field regime of a gravity theory @xcite .",
    "furthermore , future observational developments , for example with gravitational waves , will allow us to obtain different physical properties for compact objects , which will further allow for testing in the strong - field regime . from a theoretical point of view , there are attempts to test theories of gravity in the strong - field regime by using surface atomic line redshifts @xcite or gravitational waves from the neutron stars @xcite . in these investigations ,",
    "the possibility of distinguishing scalar - tensor ( st ) theory , proposed by damour & esposito - farse @xcite , from general relativity ( gr ) was discussed ( see psaltis @xcite for a review ) . whilst the existence of scalar fields has not been experimentally verified , several experiments in the weak - field limit of gr set severe limits on the existence and strength of such fields @xcite .",
    "recently , tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) theory has attracted considerable attention as an alternative gravitational theory .",
    "teves was proposed by bekenstein @xcite as a relativistic theory for modified newtonian dynamics @xcite . as such , it explains galaxy rotation curves and the tully - fisher law without the existence of dark matter .",
    "teves has also successfully explained strong gravitational lensing @xcite as well as key features of the cosmic microwave background @xcite and galaxy distributions through an evolving universe @xcite without cold dark matter . while in the strong - field regime of teves , giannios found the schwarzschild solution @xcite , and sagi and bekenstein generalized this to the reissner - nordstrm solution @xcite .",
    "furthermore , contaldi , wiseman & withers have found vacuum solutions for a constant scalar field @xcite .",
    "more recently , the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations in teves are derived by lasky , sotani & giannios @xcite , with which one can produce static , spherically symmetric neutron stars , and they showed the possibility of distinguishing teves from gr by way of redshift observations . in this article , we examine whether observations of gravitational waves associated with the neutron star oscillations can provide an alternative way of probing the gravitational theory in the strong - field regime .",
    "the attempt to estimate the stellar parameters , such as mass , radius and equation of state ( eos ) , via their oscillation properties is not a new idea .",
    "helioseismology is established fields in astronomy and one could know the information about the interior of our sun .",
    "in the late 90s , it was suggested the possibility to reveal the compact star properties through the oscillation spectra @xcite , which is called as gravitational wave asteroseismology .",
    "the stellar mass , radius and eos can be deduced by an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of fundamental , pressure and spacetime modes , i.e. , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . while the rotation period of a compact star can be revealed by the examination of @xmath4 mode oscillations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where such frequencies are proportional to the rotation rate .",
    "furthermore , the detailed analysis of the gravitational waves makes it possible to determine the radius of accretion disk around supermassive black hole @xcite or to know the magnetic effect during the stellar collapse @xcite .    in general",
    ", the oscillations of a neutron star in teves could produce not only gravitational but also scalar and vector waves , which is similar to the case in the scalar - tensor theory @xcite , and the direct detection of scalar and/or vector waves would be a unique probe for the gravitational theory .",
    "still , we will show that it is not necessary to detect these waves , because the obvious imprints due to the existence of scalar and vector fields will be apparent in the spectrum of gravitational waves associated with the stellar oscillations .",
    "although we adopt cowling approximation in this article , the more complicated analysis including the metric , vector and scalar perturbations will be seen near future somewhere .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the fundamental parts of teves and tov equations in teves , where we also show the neutron star models . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] we derive the perturbation equations with cowling approximation .",
    "then the oscillation spectra of neutron stars in teves are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] , finally we discuss the results related to gravitational wave asteroseismology in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] . in this article",
    ", we adopt the unit of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and the metric signature is @xmath8 .",
    "since details of teves can be found in @xcite , we only mention here the fundamental parts of the theory that are necessary for the present calculations .",
    "teves is based on three dynamical gravitational fields ; an einstein metric @xmath9 , a timelike 4-vector field @xmath10 , and a scalar field @xmath11 .",
    "there is also a nondynamical scalar field , @xmath12 .",
    "the vector field fulfills the normalization condition , @xmath13 , and the physical metric is given by @xmath14 all quantities in the physical frame are denoted with a tilde , and any quantity without a tilde is in the einstein frame .",
    "the total action of teves , @xmath15 , contains contributions from the three dynamical fields and a matter contribution ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "these include two positive dimensionless parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are the coupling parameters for the scalar and vector fields respectively .",
    "there also exists a dimensionless free function @xmath18 , a constant length scale @xmath19 , and a spacetime dependent lagrange multiplier , @xmath20 .    by varying the total action , @xmath15 , with respect to @xmath21",

    "( [ einstein ] ) and ( [ vector ] )  ( [ scalar1 ] ) .",
    "it has been shown in the strong - field limit that @xmath36 is an excellent approximation @xcite .",
    "on cosmological scales this is not a good choice @xcite , however in this article we only consider regions not too far from neutron stars , and we therefore set @xmath36 .",

    "moreover , whilst the functional form of @xmath18 is not predicted by the theory , one can show that when @xmath36 , the contribution of @xmath18 to the field equations vanishes @xcite .",
    "therefore , our results are independent of this function and we drop it from the remaining discussion .      first , the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations in teves are derived by lasky , sotani & giannios @xcite .",
    "here we make an brief description of tov equations .",
    "a static , spherically symmetric metric can be expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in general , the vector field for a static , spherically symmetric spacetime can be described as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are functions of @xmath4 .",

    "( see @xcite for the derivation of these equations and for a discussion with @xmath53 and/or with @xmath54 . )",

    "note that on exterior region the scalar field still exists although there is no fluid .",
    "we integrate the above equations from the center , @xmath59 , to the stellar surface , @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , the interior boundary conditions are given by @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , which are determined by taylor series expansions of the above equations near @xmath59 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the exact values for @xmath67 and @xmath68 are determined by matching the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 to their asymptotic behavior , which is found by performing a coordinate transformation on ( [ phys - metric ] ) to bring it into an asymptotically flat form .",
    "we define new coordinates @xmath71 and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 denotes the cosmological value of the scalar field . then performing an asymptotic expansion of all the equations and dropping the hats on the new coordinates for simplicity in the expressions",
    "implies @xmath74 here , @xmath75 is the total arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) mass given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the mass function evaluated at radial infinity . also , @xmath78 is the scalar mass @xcite , which is constant outside the star and is defined everywhere as @xmath79 we adopt the same eos as in @xcite , which are polytropic ones derived by fitting functions to tabulated data of realistic eos known as eos a and eos ii .",
    "the maximum masses of neutron stars in gr are @xmath80 with @xmath81 km for eos a and @xmath82 with @xmath83 km for eos ii .",
    "that is , eos a is considered soft , while eos ii is an intermediate eos .    when it comes to the study of the structure of neutron stars , teves introduces three new parameters , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath84 , with respect to gr .",
    "since the value of @xmath16 is tightly constrained by both cosmological models and also planetary motions in the outer solar system @xcite , we accordingly set @xmath85 for the remainder of the article .",
    "with respect to the value of @xmath84 , lasky , sotani & giannios showed that @xmath73 can have a minimum value of around @xmath86 , based on causality issues inside the neutron star @xcite .",

    "details of neutron star models where these parameters are allowed to vary are given in lasky , sotani & giannios @xcite , in which they showed that the dependences on @xmath16 and on @xmath73 are minimal for neutron star models . while , restrictions on @xmath17 are less severe , and have not been discussed in great detail in the literature . in this article",
    "we consider the range @xmath88 , because for @xmath89 one can show that the pressure diverges from the stellar center outward , and therefore stellar models are not possible @xcite ( sagi & bekenstein @xcite also showed that physical black hole solutions are only valid for @xmath90 ) .",
    "[ fig : rhoc - m ] shows the adm mass as a function of the central density of neutron stars .",
    "different lines correspond to different values of @xmath17 , whose values are indicated .",
    "additionally , we plot the stellar model for gr with the solid line . note that for spherically symmetric neutron stars , stellar models for the region @xmath91 could be unstable . from this figure",
    "we can see that , although the central density giving the maximum mass is almost independent from the value of @xmath17 , the corresponding maximum mass depends strongly on the parameter @xmath17 , i.e. , for larger values of @xmath17 the maximum mass becomes smaller .",

    "in this article , to examine the effect of the tensor - vector - scalar ( teves ) theory on the oscillation spectra of neutron stars , we have derived the perturbation equations of neutron stars in teves and calculated their eigen - frequencies .",
    "depending on the parameter of teves , the frequencies of fundamental oscillation could be off the well - known empirical formula in gr and they become lager than those expected in gr .",
    "we can also see the deviation from gr in the frequencies of higher overtones and they have stronger dependence on the parameter @xmath17 than the lower oscillation modes .",
