    "let @xmath0 be @xmath1-dimensional minkowski space with the standard metric @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a point in @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a surface in @xmath0 given by @xmath5 , and @xmath6 be a function in a domain @xmath7 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath6 is @xmath8-smooth everywhere in @xmath9 except for a set @xmath10 consisting of isolated points only .    a surface @xmath4 is _ space - like _ if the induced from @xmath11 metric is the positive definite metric .",
    "this is equivalent to the following inequality @xmath12 where the lower index denotes a partial derivative with respect to the corresponding variable : @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "a space - like surface @xmath4 is called _ maximal _ if the following equality holds @xmath15 everywhere in @xmath16 .",
    "then it is well - known that ( [ first ] ) is equivalent to the vanishing of the mean curvature of @xmath4 ( with respect to its embedding in the minkowski space @xmath11 ) .",
    "cheng and yau in @xcite proved that for every entire maximal surface @xmath4 ( i.e. the surface to be defined over the whole @xmath17 ) satisfies the bernstein property . in other words ,",
    "an entire solution @xmath18 to  ( [ second])-([first ] ) is always an affine function . on the other hand , the study of _ almost - entire _ solutions to ( [ second])-([first ] ) , i.e. solutions that they are of @xmath8 outside of a non - empty descrete set @xmath19 , is of great interest",
    "really , there are a lot of connections between this theory and the modern physics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the first break - through in this direction was due to ecker @xcite , who established that the rotationally symmetric maximal surfaces ( ` maximal catenoids ' ) @xmath20 are only almost - entire solutions with @xmath19 consisting of the origin .",
    "moreover , in the same paper it was proved that every isolated singular point of a maximal ( not necessarily entire ) surface behaves as a light cone .",
    "namely , let @xmath21 be an isolated singular point of a solution @xmath6 which is defined at a neighborhood of @xmath22 then @xmath6 can be extended continuously at @xmath22 and @xmath23 an important characteristic of a singular point is the flux of the solution which is defined as @xmath24 where the integral is taken over a closed surface @xmath25 which encloses @xmath22 and contains no singular points , and @xmath26 denotes the outward unit normal to @xmath27 .",
    "it follows from ( [ first ] ) that integral ( [ fourth ] ) is independent on a choice of @xmath27 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath28 is a lorentzian invariant of @xmath4 .",
    "it is not hard to prove that a point @xmath29 is an essential singularity of the solution @xmath6 if and only if @xmath30 @xcite .    in recent papers @xcite ,",
    "@xcite the asymptotic behaviour and the existence questions for solutions to ( [ second])-([first ] ) were studied . in",
    "particularly , it was shown in @xcite that under some natural geometrical assumptions on the finite set @xmath19 there exists a unique almost - entire solution @xmath6 with the prescribed fluxes @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath19 is the singular set of the solution .",
    "on the other hand , there are no explicit examples except for the mentioned above `` maximal catenoids '' ( [ third ] ) even in the two - dimensional case . in this paper",
    "we construct a one - parametric family of periodic almost - entire maximal surfaces whose singular set is discrete ( consists of isolated points ) and located on the fixed line .",
    "these examples are based on the following general assertion which completely characterizes all maximal surfaces with harmonic level - sets .",
    "let @xmath33 satisfy ( [ second])-([first ] ) and let @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a harmonic function .",
    "then @xmath35 is a real part of the holomorphic function @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is one of the following    \\(i ) @xmath38 ;    \\(ii ) @xmath39 ;    \\(iii ) @xmath40 . + here @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .    the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) lead us to the well - known examples : the plane , the rotational surface , the helicoid and sherk s maximal surfaces .",
    "in the case ( iii ) the surface is space - like only if @xmath45 , moreover in that case it has infinitely many isolated singularity points . the explicit expression and analysis we shall give in the remained part of the paper .    in fact , the examples of one - periodic maximal surfaces constructed in this paper are a small part of a bigger family of double- and one - periodic maximal two - dimensional surfaces which we treat in the forthcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath46 be a @xmath8-function such that @xmath47 and @xmath48 then the graph of @xmath46 is a maximal surface in @xmath49 .",
    "now we consider the function @xmath46 such that @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52   are some twice - differentiable functions .",
    "then ( [ ur1 ] ) can be brought to the following form : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath57 , @xmath37 be holomorphic functions , @xmath41 .",
    "then the following identities take place @xmath58 @xmath59 here @xmath60 denotes the conjugate to @xmath61 function .",
    "[ lemm1 ]    the cauchi - riemann conditions imply @xmath62 @xmath63    we prove the validity of the first equality only : @xmath64 the second equality can be proved by the same way , hence the lemma is proved completely .",
    "let @xmath65 , @xmath41 , where @xmath66 is a holomorphic function in the domain @xmath67 .",
    "in order to find the coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 of equation ( [ ur2 ] ) , from ( [ koshi ] ) we notice @xmath70 @xmath71 then @xmath72 and the equation  ( [ ur2 ] ) becomes @xmath73 setting @xmath74 we find that @xmath75    the term @xmath76 in the equation ( [ chast1 ] ) depends only on @xmath65 if and only if @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a real constant .",
    "[ lemm2 ]    let @xmath79 .",
    "we show that the condition of the functional dependence @xmath80 is equivalent to @xmath81 , @xmath82 . indeed , by virtue of ( [ koshi ] ) @xmath83 , @xmath84 and ( [ l1 ] )",
    ", we have @xmath85    then @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 and , finally , @xmath89    simplifying the last expression yields @xmath90 the latter identity holds in a non - empty domain @xmath67 , hence by the uniqueness theorem for analitic functions , there exists a real constant @xmath78 such that @xmath81 . the lemma is proved .",
    "now we consider the differential equation ( [ mmm ] ) with a holomorphic in some domain @xmath67 function @xmath37 . one can easily show that the set of solutions of this equation makes up the following functional family : ( a ) @xmath38 ; ( b ) @xmath39 ; ( c ) @xmath91 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath92 .",
    "now we consider the last case , when @xmath93 . here",
    "we have @xmath94 and , hence , @xmath95 without loss of generality , we may assume that the constant in the right hand side of the last equality is identically zero .",
    "then @xmath96 and @xmath97 on the other hand , @xmath98 then the equation ( [ chast1 ] ) takes the form @xmath99 by solving the ordinary differential equation we arrive at @xmath100 and @xmath101    to find the admissible values of the parameter @xmath102",
    "which correspond to the space - like examples , we check when the inequality @xmath103 holds . for this purpose",
    "we write @xmath104 and by using a new variable @xmath105 , we obtain @xmath106        we denote @xmath113 and assume without loss of generality that @xmath114",
    ". then @xmath115 @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "let us introduce @xmath119 .",
    "then @xmath120 i.e. by means of the jacobi elliptic sinus , we find @xmath121          let @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "then the surface @xmath126 given implicitly by @xmath127 is a maximal surface in @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , this surface is a graph of a real analytic function everywhere except for the set consisting of singular points @xmath129    we observe that for different values of @xmath130 , the surfaces @xmath126 are lorentz non - isometric .",
    "one can also see that @xmath126 is located in the parallel slab @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind ( the least positive solution of equation @xmath133 ) .",
    "moreover , one can show that the flux @xmath134 at the singular point @xmath135 is equal to @xmath136"
