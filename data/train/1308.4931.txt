    "in 1983 islam , @xcite , showed that the trajectory of light in schwarzschild de sitter , henceforth sds , space is independent of the cosmological constant .",
    "as we shall see , this conclusion is , for the most part , correct but does not imply that physical measurements associated with trajectories of light do not depend on @xmath0 as well . making this concept clear will enable us to see a source of confusion in some of the recent literature on the topic .",
    "it seems that merely based on islam s work it was generally assumed that @xmath0 plays no role in gravitational lensing phenomena and has no place in the analysis ; and that the appearance of @xmath0 in some equations could be transformed away , in one way or another , and therefore is artificial , revealing the true independence on @xmath0 .",
    "this general belief turns out to be true only in situations where no measurements made by specific observers are considered . however , to study the phenomenon properly , it is important to consider measurements made by observers and the dependence of measurable quantities on the system parameters . in 2007",
    "rindler and ishak , @xcite , showed that if measurable intersection angles are considered , in a standard simple setup of gravitational deflection of light , then results of interest do depend on @xmath0 .",
    "rindler and ishak s conclusions immediately led to both enthusiasm and scepticism ; perhaps they were mistakenly seen to be in direct contradiction to the common belief that followed after islam s work .",
    "since their original paper , there was much activity surrounding this topic .",
    "some authors searched for other setups and methods of analysis in which results of interest depend on @xmath0 in support of rindler and ishak s conclusions , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "others tried to find errors in rindler and ishak s work and explain the invalidity of their conclusions , and ultimately show that the traditional approach to the topic needs no modification , see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . all together , the papers that followed @xcite amount to a very interesting discussion of the subject , in which , unfortunately , there are no definitively agreed upon answers to many important questions . in what follows we attempt to make the theory abundantly clear and explain the exact role of @xmath0 in gravitational lensing phenomena .",
    "we discuss and clarify key issues and illuminate sources of disagreement in the recent literature . in turn",
    "we hope to settle the ongoing debate on the influence of @xmath0 and present a clear description of light deflection phenomenon in sds space together with all the necessary tools for analyzing any setup .",
    "along the course of our investigation , we derive and introduce an invariant general formula , which allows the determination of a measurable intersection angle from fundamental parameters .",
    "this formula seems to be essential in the study of the present topic , but quite surprisingly is missing from the current literature .",
    "we also address the role of relativistic aberration of light in the analysis and demonstrate how our general formula encompasses this effect and allows for a simple way to account for it .",
    "in fact , the general formula can be used to derive an invariant aberration equation , applicable to any background geometry and orientation , and which reduces to the known aberration equation as a special case . the general angle formula and the general aberration equation we present",
    "may be considered as some of the most significant results of this paper ; their applicability may extend to multiple areas well beyond the current topic .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss the influence of @xmath0 on the geometry and build an intuitive understanding of how this may lead to the appearance of @xmath0 in results of interest . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we turn our attention to null geodesics and address the fundamental issue regarding the appearance of @xmath0 in the orbital equation of light and its solution .",
    "in section [ sec4 ] we continue the discussion of the above issue and present the necessary tools needed to pose and answer some important questions .",
    "in section [ sec5 ] we derive the general formula for measurable intersection angles and demonstrate its use in a few applications .",
    "finally , in section [ sec6 ] we discuss some of the recent papers on the topic and respond to their results and conclusions .",
    "consider the kottler metric @xcite , describing sds spacetime , @xmath1 where @xmath2 here we have an object of mass @xmath3 at the centre of the coordinates , in a universe with a cosmological constant @xmath4 .",
    "the range that we are interested in is @xmath5 ; for the case where both @xmath3 and @xmath0 are sufficiently small , this implies that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this range",
    ", @xmath9 is a time - like coordinate while @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are space - like coordinates . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are known as the schwarzschild and the de sitter horizons , respectively . sometimes also called the inner and outer horizons , respectively , in the context of sds space .",
    "it is easily verified that any orbit in this geometry can be confined to a single azimuthally symmetric spatial slice containing the origin .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality we can take @xmath15 , and consider motion in the sub spacetime , with the metric @xmath16 it is useful to take slices of constant @xmath9 in this spacetime and study orbits in the two dimensional subspace , parametrized by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the metric on such a slice of space is @xmath17 it is immediately evident that this space is not flat , however since it is parametrized by polar coordinates , ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) , we can construct flat diagrams depicting the orbits taking place in the slice .",
    "we must however keep in mind the difference between our flat diagrams and the curved physical space in which measurements may take place . that is ,",
    "diagrams will be drawn on a flat ( @xmath10,@xmath11 ) plane , real events will be taking place in the curved spacetime , a slice of which is represented by metric .",
    "making this distinction is particularly important when considering angles .",
    "intersection angles between curves appearing on the flat diagram may be considerably different when projected onto the curved physical space . for a visual demonstration of the issue",
    "let us consider the portion of sds space in between the two horizons and isometrically embed the two dimensional slice with metric in flat three dimensional space . through an isometric embedding , which preserves distances",
    ", we can picture the structure of the underlying geometry in which the physical events take place . to this end , let us take a flat 3-space with cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath18,@xmath19,@xmath20 ) and metric @xmath21 the complete description of the embedding is complicated for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , but when both parameters are small enough , specifically when the product @xmath24 is negligibly small , then a convenient approximation can be used to get the shape of the surface .",
    "we consider this , realistic , case of such small parameters and approximate the embedded surface for small and large @xmath10 in turn .    for small @xmath10 , @xmath25 , and",
    "the metric of is approximately @xmath26 where @xmath27 embedding this 2-surface in the flat 3-space of metric yields the following relationships : @xmath28 the embedded surface is therefore the set in flat 3-space satisfying @xmath29 it is known as flamm s paraboloid . to ensure a one to one correspondence of points we only consider one half of the paraboloid , allowing only positive @xmath20 on the embedded surface .",
    "hence , at small @xmath10 the intrinsic geometry of the surface described by metric can be approximated by flamm s paraboloid , shown in figure [ fig1 ] .        for large @xmath10 , @xmath30 , and",
    "the metric of is approximately @xmath31 where @xmath32 embedding this 2-surface in the flat 3-space of metric yields the following relationships . @xmath33",
    "the embedded surface is therefore the set in flat 3-space satisfying @xmath34 it describes half of a spherical shell . to ensure a one to one correspondence of points we only consider positive values of @xmath20 on the embedded surface",
    "hence , at large values of @xmath10 , the intrinsic geometry of the surface described by metric can be approximated by half of a spherical shell , shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the overall shape of the embedded surface of metric can be approximated by piecing together flamm s paraboloid for small @xmath10 and the half shell for large @xmath10 .",
    "this resulting surface , depicted in figure [ fig3 ] , is a qualitative representation of the shape of the slice ; its main use is in visualizing how the distances associated with the coordinates stretch due to intrinsic geometry .",
    "one may argue that to properly connect the surfaces of large @xmath10 and small @xmath10 , the lower half of the spherical shell at large @xmath10 must be used , that is , @xmath20 must be taken negative in the transformation when ensuring bijection , however , for our purposes this is not important .",
    "this visualization will be an aid in qualitatively understanding how the system parameters @xmath3 and @xmath0 affect measurable angles .",
    "let us consider a static observer in the sub spacetime with metric and constant coordinates ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "let the local frame of this observer be confined to this sub spacetime as well , that is @xmath15 and @xmath36 .",
    "since the direction of increasing proper time of the local frame of this observer coincides with the direction of increasing @xmath9 , the space portion of the observer s frame coincides with a local patch around ( @xmath35 ) in the ( @xmath37 ) surface with metric .",
    "that is , the space , and curvature , around the static observer can be described by metric , and can be visualized as a small patch on the isometrically embedded surface of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "this fact makes the special case of a static observer particularly useful in building understanding .",
    "however , outcomes of measurements generally depend on the motion of observers , and therefore a more detailed treatment is required for a complete description and establishment of practical relationships . as we progress to derive some general results , for arbitrary observers , we shall treat the case of a static observer at every step where observable angles are of interest .",
    "it will serve as a simple example of the physical phenomena at hand and as a specific case for others to be compared with .",
    "consider now two arbitrary curves on the flat ( @xmath37 ) plane , intersecting at a point @xmath38 .",
    "these curves may describe actual trajectories taking place in the curved physical space with metric .",
    "the true ( spatial ) shape of these trajectories is fully determined only when projected from the flat plane onto the curved space , where the trajectories may physically exist .",
    "consider a static observer at @xmath38 who makes a measurement of the intersection angle between the two curves .",
    "the situation is illustrated in figure [ fig4 ] below . from the discussion in the previous paragraph",
    ", it is apparent that intersection angles measured by a static observer will be those on the embedded surface , which are sustained by the projected curves . clearly , the euclidean intersection angle , @xmath39 , appearing on the flat plane is different than the measurable intersection angle , @xmath40 , appearing on the embedded , curved , surface , see figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "this is precisely the point we aim to make , and a fact that must be kept in mind when plotting curves that represent physical trajectories , on the flat plane .",
    "is euclidean and belongs to the flat plane .",
    "the intersection angle @xmath40 takes place on the curved surface and measurable by a static observer.,width=321 ]    the difference between @xmath39 and @xmath40 comes only from the fact that the physical space is curved due to @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "it is already clear , qualitatively , that even if one of @xmath3 or @xmath0 were zero these angles would still not equal , and given the angle @xmath39 one would need both @xmath3 and @xmath0 to find @xmath40 , and vice versa .",
    "finally , we see that while the euclidean angle , @xmath39 , depends only on the shape of the curves , the measurable angle , @xmath40 , depends on both the shape of the curves and the shape of the space itself , in which the true trajectories exist and intersect .",
    "the dependence of the shape of the space on the system parameters is clear and comes directly from the given metric .",
    "the dependence of the shape of curves on the parameters is determined in accordance to the particular situation being analyzed .",
    "of course , the curves of central interest in the present work are the ones describing trajectories of light rays .",
    "let us restate the main conclusions of this section that are important to keep in mind in what follows .",
    "first , a clear distinction must be made between quantities that belong to the flat ( euclidean ) plane on which diagrams are drawn , and quantities that are physically measurable .",
    "and second , to properly account for the various ways of influence when considering the dependence of measurable intersection angles between curves on the system parameters in general , one must consider both effects of the parameters on the curves and on the geometry of the space , where curves may physically exist and measurements may take place .",
    "again we confine the motion to the plane @xmath15 without loss of generality , and use metric .",
    "the two trivial killing vectors ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) , along with the null condition , satisfied by trajectories of light , yield the following equations .",
    "@xmath44 here , @xmath45 is an affine parameter , parametrizing the trajectory , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constants of the motion .",
    "these equations can be combined to give the differential equation , satisfied by a curve in the ( @xmath37 ) plane , describing the path of a light ray .",
    "@xmath48 , \\label{tp2e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 solutions for this equation divide into a few categories and exhibit a number of interesting features .",
    "although obtaining the exact solutions is not simple , they do exist in the literature , @xcite , and can be used at any time to describe a path exactly or to test the validity of an approximation to any degree of accuracy .",
    "fortunately , for realistic values of @xmath3 and @xmath10 , the combination @xmath50 is very small , and approximations in the low orders of @xmath50 prove to be very accurate .",
    "such approximations are most popular in the literature and textbooks on the subject , but it is comforting to know that exact solutions exist as well . the type of trajectories we shall mainly be interested in is the one for which there is an axis of symmetry along with other important features that we discuss in what follows .",
    "such symmetric trajectories have a point of closest approach , with a minimum value of @xmath10 , and extend to infinity ( in the analytical sense , on the ( @xmath37 ) plane ) on both sides of the axis of symmetry .",
    "it can be shown that the value of @xmath10 for these trajectories does not go below @xmath51 . in regions where the value of @xmath10 is much larger than @xmath3 , these trajectories exhibit asymptotic behaviour and",
    "can be described by straight lines , referred to as the asymptotes of the trajectory .",
    "the features listed here are well known and easy to establish analytically",
    ". we shall not cover all the mathematical details here but rather give an account of the key physical features and parameters that are important for what follows .",
    "concentrating on the symmetric trajectories with a point of closest approach , let the coordinates of this point be ( @xmath52 ) . at this point ,",
    "the derivative @xmath53 is zero , and equation gives @xmath54 let us also define a third parameter , @xmath55 , as follows .",
    "@xmath56 this allows us to write equation in three ways using the three different parameters , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath55 .",
    "so in addition to we also have , for convenience , @xmath59 , \\label{tp2e3}\\ ] ] and @xmath60 .",
    "\\label{tp2e4}\\ ] ] notice that only when the parameter @xmath57 is used in the governing differential equation does @xmath0 make an appearance .",
    "all three parameters will be discussed in considerable detail in the next section . without any mathematical labour",
    ", we can assume that a required solution to equation ( as well as and ) exists and can be written as follows , using either of the three parameters .",
    "@xmath61 @xmath62 or @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is a constant of integration that is related to the orientation of the path . in each case",
    "there are two independent constants of motion to find in order to determine a specific trajectory in the subspace of interest , which is a particular set of points ( @xmath37 ) through which the light ray passes . to this end",
    ", we must consider some boundary conditions . in",
    "what follows , four different sets of boundary conditions will be discussed in turn .",
    "we shall always assume that the value of @xmath3 is given in addition to any boundary conditions .",
    "let @xmath65 and @xmath66 be two points in space through which the light ray passes , with coordinates ( @xmath67 ) and ( @xmath68 ) , respectively .",
    "assume that the path of light connecting these points satisfies the conditions discussed above , i.e. point of closest approach , symmetry etc .",
    "using the boundary conditions in gives the following two equations with two unknowns .",
    "@xmath69 it can be shown that the values of @xmath55 and @xmath64 are in general not unique for such boundary conditions ; the possible values constitute a countable set , describing a family of curves connecting the two points . in this family",
    "each curve has a specific value of @xmath58 , and there exists a unique trajectory with the largest value of @xmath58 connecting the two points . in practice , it is this trajectory which is usually of primary concern , and the one that is often approximated to various orders in @xmath3 .",
    "either way , it can be shown in general that for given two points in space connected by the path of light , a given mass @xmath3 , and some additional restriction ( which may be set by a requirement on the time - like interval or space - like distance of travel ) , it is possible to find unique values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , for which equation will describe the required unique trajectory .",
    "of course , an identical procedure can be followed by using equation and the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath64 instead , leading to identical conclusions .",
    "therefore , these considerations reveal that for such boundary conditions , the trajectory , which is a set of points on the ( @xmath37 ) plane satisfying the governing equation , depends only on the mass @xmath3 and the two points in space @xmath65 and @xmath66 through which it passes ; it is independent of @xmath0 in the simple sense that changing the value of @xmath0 will not alter the path satisfying these boundary conditions .",
    "in other words , with these boundary conditions the path of light in the subspace parametrized by @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be determined with or without knowledge of @xmath0 .",
    "let ( @xmath52 ) be the coordinates of the point of closest approach of the trajectory .",
    "since in this case @xmath58 is known from the start , we can use equation as our first integral , for which all the parameters are known . integrating this equation",
    "will give a solution of the form , in which only the parameter @xmath64 remains to be determined from the boundary conditions .",
    "plugging @xmath58 and @xmath72 in gives an equation for @xmath64 , which for a given choice of branch establishes a unique value of c(@xmath73 ) .",
    "that is , for these boundary conditions there is a unique path .",
    "the values of @xmath55 and @xmath64 are determined uniquely ( up to a sign , which does not affect the shape of the path ) from the values of @xmath58 , @xmath72 and @xmath3 .",
    "again , we see that @xmath0 has no influence on the path in the same sense as for the previous set of boundary conditions .",
    "varying the value of @xmath0 does not alter the path .",
    "a little investigation reveals that the parameter @xmath55 , which depends only on @xmath58 and @xmath3 , determines the overall shape of the path , while the parameter @xmath64 only determines the orientation ( the direction of the axis of symmetry ) . due to",
    "this fact and no loss of generality in setting orientation , it is often sufficient to use only the parameter @xmath55 to describe the path in many situations .",
    "these boundary conditions are particularly useful due to the uniqueness of the corresponding paths and the ability to find the parameter @xmath55 directly , without the need for integration or knowledge of @xmath0 , from equation .",
    "this set of boundary conditions can be considered as a generalization of the previous set .",
    "let ( @xmath67 ) be a known point on the path and @xmath39 be the given euclidean intersection angle on the flat diagram , sustained by the path of light under investigation and the radial path of light passing through ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the situation is depicted in the following figure .",
    "plane , passing through a point with coordinates ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "the figure also shows the point of closest approach of this path , with @xmath74 , and a radial path of light , which also passes through the point ( @xmath67 ) . the intersection angle between the two paths on this flat diagram",
    "is @xmath39.,width=321 ]    in the flat , euclidean , space of this diagram , the angle @xmath39 is related to the differentials of the path at this point in the following way : @xmath75 this relationship can be easily formed by considering the local space around ( @xmath67 ) , and separating the radial and angular components of the tangent to the path . for simplicity",
    "let us drop the absolute value , and from now on assume that when there is a sign ambiguity it is the positive that is taken .",
    "the above can then be immediately rearranged to obtain @xmath76 as a function of @xmath77 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , boundary conditions which give a known point and a euclidean intersection angle with a radial line at that point are equivalent to giving a known point and a derivative at that point . with these boundary conditions equations and can be used to find the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath55 , either of which is sufficient to find the overall shape of the path , up to orientation . upon integration",
    ", the parameter @xmath64 can be found as well by plugging the point ( @xmath67 ) in the resulting relationship of the form or .",
    "thus , with these boundary conditions the path is determined uniquely ; the set of points ( @xmath37 ) through which the light ray passes depends only on @xmath3 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath39 . as in both previous cases ,",
    "the trajectory does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "we see that this set of boundary conditions is in a sense equivalent to set 2 , which may be considered as a special case .",
    "whether it is set 1 that is initially given ( with some condition to ensure uniqueness ) or set 3 , it may be convenient in each case to find the value of @xmath58 and classify the path according to this parameter , since its interpretation is intuitive and it is all that is needed for a complete description of the path , up to orientation . with this in mind",
    ", we shall always assume that a given trajectory of light , of the required type , may be uniquely described by a set of values @xmath3 , @xmath58 and @xmath72 , regardless of what euclidean , or coordinate related , boundary conditions that are in the plane we initially start with .",
    "let ( @xmath67 ) be a known point on the path and @xmath40 be the measurable intersection angle , at this point , between the trajectory of light under investigation and the radial trajectory of light , passing through ( @xmath67 ) , measured by an observer with 4-velocity @xmath79 .",
    "this set of boundary conditions is different from the previous three sets in a fundamental way .",
    "it includes a directly measurable quantity as a boundary condition .",
    "although the coordinates of the points @xmath65 , @xmath66 , ( @xmath52 ) , ( @xmath67 ) and the derivative ( or @xmath39 ) of sets 1 , 2 and 3 can , in principle , be determined through measurements , they are all euclidean quantities that belong to the flat diagram .",
    "they may or may not have a physical interpretation as well , but their mathematical origin in the analysis has nothing to do with actual measurements .",
    "in contrast , the current set of boundary conditions includes a measurable angle , which may have a complicated relationship with the euclidean quantities appearing on the plane that are needed to determine the path . considering the discussion of the previous section and referring to figure [ fig4 ]",
    ", we see that for the special case of a static observer , there can be constructed an intuitive relationship between the measurable angle @xmath40 and the euclidean angle @xmath39 . in this special case , which serves as a clear example , out of the parameters appearing in the relationship between @xmath40 and @xmath39",
    "there will be both @xmath3 and @xmath0 , since they both influence the geometry of the embedded space .",
    "in general , for an observer with arbitrary 4-velocity , @xmath79 , the relationship between the angles will contain @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath77 , and the components of @xmath79 as parameters .",
    "thus , to determine the path in the ( @xmath37 ) plane with these boundary conditions one can find the euclidean intersection angle , @xmath39 , from @xmath40 , @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath77 , and @xmath79 , and use it along with the point ( @xmath67 ) as in the case of set 3 .",
    "evidently , this set of boundary conditions is , in some sense , equivalent to set 3 , both sets yield a unique path . with a given observer , for the current set",
    ", there is a one to one correspondence with the parameters of set 3 , which can be used to convert from one set of boundary conditions to another .",
    "it is clear that the value of @xmath0 must be known in order to convert @xmath40 of this set into @xmath39 of set 3 .",
    "in fact , without the knowledge of @xmath0 it is not possible to find the trajectory of light which satisfies the boundary conditions of the current set . hence , with these boundary conditions the path is determined by @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath40 , and @xmath79 .",
    "we notice that @xmath0 does affect the path in this case , and , overall , it affects the path when certain ( directly ) measurable parameters are used as boundary conditions .",
    "it does not affect the path if all the boundary conditions are euclidean or coordinate related , which appear on the flat diagram .",
    "+ with the above examples in mind we see that , in contrast to the influence of @xmath3 , the influence of @xmath0 on a path of light can come only from uncommon boundary conditions that are usually associated with measurements . since in most cases in the literature the boundary conditions are coordinate - like , or euclidean , then in light of the above examples it may be loosely concluded that @xmath0 has no direct affect on the resulting paths . however , this common conclusion may be somewhat misleading if the assumptions on the boundary conditions are not stated explicitly .",
    "indeed , it is important to keep in mind that no general conclusions should be made regarding the overall influence of @xmath0 , which is sensitive to the particular situation being analyzed .",
    "as an additional example to set 4 , which brings in @xmath0 through an observable quantity , consider a set of boundary conditions that contains two points on the path , one of them being the position of the source emitting the light ray ; in the cosmological context this source could be a distant galaxy .",
    "such a set is similar to set 1 , it can be used in an identical way to establish the path of the ray , though it may have one important difference in regards to @xmath0 .",
    "given some astrophysical model , or tabulated data , which provides the position of the source , it could be the case that the position is a function of both time and @xmath0 , and therefore , the appearance of @xmath0 once again will come from the boundary conditions but in a different way than it was for set 4 .",
    "thus , we stress that the influence of @xmath0 on a path of light and associated quantities of interest depends closely on the particular situation being analyzed , and in saying that a path is independent of @xmath0 one implicitly means that the path is subject to coordinate - like , or euclidean , boundary conditions which do not depend on @xmath0 themselves .",
    "overall , it should be clear now in what way @xmath0 may influence a path of light , and how its influence is hidden in measurements , or rather , more generally , in boundary conditions .",
    "when analyzing a common setup , it may be straightforward to foresee whether @xmath0 will have an influence on results of interest or not .",
    "let us consider a set of euclidean boundary conditions , such as one of the first three sets discussed , and investigate the qualitative dependence of the resulting path of light in the ( @xmath37 ) plane on the system parameters @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "as explained , it is convenient to convert any given set of euclidean boundary conditions to the set of @xmath58 , @xmath72 , if it is not initially expressed as such .",
    "further , without loss of generality , for illustration purposes we can orient the coordinates so that @xmath80 .",
    "the following figures depict the dependence of the path on the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath0 , for a set value of @xmath58 .",
    "plane , passing through a point with coordinates ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath3 is successively increasing , starting from the top , and its influence is illustrated through the three diagrams .",
    "the value of @xmath0 is kept constant and it is assumed that the outer horizon is too far to be shown on the graphs.,width=321 ]     plane , passing through a point with coordinates ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "while the value of @xmath3 is kept constant , the value of @xmath0 is successively increasing , starting from the left , and its lack of influence on the path is illustrated through the three diagrams .",
    "the outer horizon is also shown on the three diagrams as the dashed circle . although the shape of the path does not change with varying @xmath0 , the geometry of the underlying space as well as the location of the outer horizon both change.,width=321 ]    these figures make it clear that , in the region between the horizons , for typical euclidean boundary conditions , only when varying @xmath3 the path of light changes .",
    "varying @xmath0 only changes the location of the outer horizon on the diagram .",
    "but although the path itself may be independent of @xmath0 , we shall make it abundantly clear that there is an influence of @xmath0 on measurements of intersection angles of light rays , and as one may expect this influence near the outer horizon may be quite significant .",
    "+ the fact that , while both @xmath3 and @xmath0 appear in the metric , but only @xmath3 has an effect on paths of light in space deserves further attention",
    ". it is illuminating to study the paths in de sitter space , for the case @xmath82 in equations , , .",
    "the three equations are then @xmath83,\\ ] ] @xmath84,\\ ] ] and @xmath85.\\ ] ] we immediately recognize that for @xmath82 the paths are straight lines with a point of closest approach at @xmath74 .",
    "notice that @xmath86 in this case and , as before , either of these two parameters can be found from euclidean boundary conditions without the need for @xmath0 , and conveniently describe the entire path up to orientation .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 , on the other hand , has no independent interpretation in this case ; it is determined through its relation to @xmath58 , and can only be found given knowledge of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , paths of light in de sitter space are straight lines , and are independent of @xmath0 for given euclidean boundary conditions . in other words ,",
    "the set of points that lay on the path of a light ray in the ( @xmath37 ) plane that connects two given points is independent of the value of @xmath0 .",
    "intuitively , in defining a bending angle for paths of light , the value of such an angle should be zero for a path which is a straight line .",
    "this is an intuitive and important requirement to keep in mind when considering bending angles in sds space .",
    "it is also interesting to further investigate the non influence of @xmath0 on paths of light from the following mathematical perspective .",
    "evidently , the way in which @xmath0 appears in the first order differential equation , , makes it entangled , in some sense , with the parameter @xmath57 , allowing for the complete absorption of @xmath0 by transforming to a new parameter , for example @xmath55 or @xmath58 . for",
    "the sake of curiosity , let us consider a more general coefficient of @xmath87 in the metric , changing @xmath88 to @xmath89 in @xmath90 , for some @xmath91 .",
    "proceeding as before to obtain the first order equation of the path , we find @xmath92 . \\label{tp2e8}\\ ] ] again , restricting to symmetric trajectories with a point of closest approach , setting @xmath93 at @xmath58 gives @xmath94 which can be used to rewrite in terms of the coordinate distance of closest approach , @xmath58 : @xmath95&.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath58 can be set by boundary conditions in a given setup , making the effect of @xmath0 on the path clear for a given value of @xmath91 .",
    "interestingly , only when @xmath96 does the effect of @xmath0 on the path vanish .",
    "then @xmath0 completely disappears from the equation , leaving @xmath58 and @xmath3 the only parameters .",
    "it is this specific value of @xmath91 that happens to occur in the sds ( and de sitter ) metric , making it the only special case in which @xmath0 has no affect on paths of light in space .",
    "thus , the power of 2 appearing in the @xmath10 coefficient of @xmath0 reveals much about its geometric characteristics and its apparent influence on paths of light .",
    "going back to equations , and , we wish to make a clear distinction between the three parameters @xmath55 , @xmath58 and @xmath57 , and gain clear mathematical and physical interpretations for each . as discussed , the parameter @xmath58 is particularly useful ; it gives the shape of a unique path up to orientation .",
    "given @xmath58 , all the important features of a trajectory can be found without knowledge of @xmath0 . given any other complete set of euclidean boundary conditions , @xmath58 can be found and used to describe the path on its own . an important question is whether @xmath58 is measurable . in principle , a static observer in a spherically symmetric , static spacetime can find its radial coordinate through measurements .",
    "for example , the measurable circumference of a stationary ring centred around the origin is @xmath97 . by slowly moving around the circumference or setting an array of observers ,",
    "the corresponding length can be found and @xmath10 can be determined . similarly , by dividing the ring into sections , angular separations can be set .",
    "see @xcite ( chapter 9 ) for remarkably clear and illuminating discussions related to such measurements .",
    "thus , in principle , the coordinates of a given static point ( @xmath37 ) in the space slice can be found through measurements by observers in that space . in particular , the coordinates of any point through which a given , fixed , light ray passes can be found by means of measurements , including ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the method in this example may not be practical but it is meant to make a clear illustration of the fact that it is possible , in principle , to determine the value of @xmath58 through measurements without knowledge of @xmath0 , or even @xmath3 . clearly , it is possible to convert @xmath58 to @xmath55 and vice versa , for values of @xmath98 , without the knowledge of @xmath0 , see equation .",
    "therefore , as far as the mathematical description of the path is concerned , the two parameters are equivalent for @xmath98 . since @xmath55 can be found from @xmath58 , which can be found from measurements , we conclude that @xmath55 can be found , indirectly , from measurements as well , without the need for @xmath0 .",
    "we shall see that @xmath55 happens to be the impact parameter , to be defined more precisely in what follows .",
    "finally , given the parameter @xmath55 , the shape of the path can be described up to orientation , without the need for @xmath0 .",
    "the remaining parameter to discuss is @xmath57 , which is unfortunately the least useful and most popular of the three .",
    "it is immediately evident that given a fixed path , for which @xmath58 and @xmath55 can be determined , the value of the parameter @xmath57 can only be found with the knowledge of @xmath0 from equations .",
    "therefore , for a given value of @xmath57 , one needs the value of @xmath0 to determine the shape of the path , up to orientation . of course ,",
    "in a situation where @xmath57 is given a priori , one may conclude that @xmath0 influences the shape of the path .",
    "however , @xmath57 should not be treated as a boundary condition , but rather as a parameter to be determined from boundary conditions , in the same way as @xmath55 and @xmath64 of equations - .",
    "further , considering the relationship between @xmath57 and @xmath55 in equations leads to the following question . which of the two parameters is independent of @xmath0 , if any , and which is dependent ?",
    "at this point , the answer to this question is somewhat straightforward . for a path with typical euclidean boundary conditions",
    "the value of @xmath55 can be determined independently of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore @xmath55 can be viewed as a parameter of the trajectory that is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , @xmath55 can be used as a boundary condition since it is in one to one correspondence with @xmath58 , for a given @xmath3 and @xmath98 .",
    "this leaves the parameter @xmath57 as the parameter that depends on the values of @xmath55 and @xmath0 in the relationship given by equations .",
    "thus , for a given trajectory , @xmath57 should never be treated as a parameter that is independent of @xmath0 , especially when studying the effects of @xmath0 .",
    "technically , we could even throw avogadro s number , say @xmath99 , into the sum containing @xmath57 and @xmath0 , that is : @xmath100 , and the situation would not change , since the boundary conditions will determine the value of the whole sum in the brackets .",
    "it is the value of @xmath55 ( represented by this sum ) that sets the shape of the path , while the value of @xmath57 shifts to compensate for @xmath0 , or whatever else you throw at it , like avogadro s number or any other imaginable constant . in other words",
    ", the boundary conditions will set the value in the brackets above , which is a constant of the path that does not depend on @xmath0 , shifting the value of @xmath0 or adding anything new into the brackets will result in a shift of the value of @xmath57 so that the total value of the brackets remains the same .",
    "although the physical interpretation of the parameter @xmath57 is not yet clear , these considerations clarify the mathematical role of @xmath57 in a typical situation .",
    "an important question now is whether it is theoretically possible to measure @xmath57 directly or , rather , find it from measurable quantities without knowledge of @xmath0 .",
    "if possible , this could lead to a way of finding @xmath0 experimentally ( by determining @xmath57 and @xmath55 independently ) , and allow for situations in which the parameter @xmath57 can be known a priori , which would force us to reconsider it as a possible boundary condition .",
    "let us investigate the above question in detail . at a given point in the ( @xmath37 )",
    "plane through which a ray of light passes , the possible measurements that can be made by an observer on the ray are the energy of the photons and the angle the ray makes with a given reference direction . of course ,",
    "for light consisting of a bundle of rays there may be more possible measurements to make , for example the size of the visible solid angle associated with the bundle .",
    "such measurements we study in detail in @xcite , but these are of no major consequence in the current discussion ; more on this in the next section . in realistic situations ,",
    "the deflecting mass is a luminous object , making radial light rays a good reference .",
    "as previously discussed , the coordinate parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be found , in principle , through measurements independent of @xmath0 .",
    "if we consider an extended frame around the observer , large enough to contain a sufficient amount of points through which the light passes to make accurate measurements , and if the coordinates ( @xmath37 ) of each point are found as well , then the change in @xmath10 can be compared to the change in @xmath11 of this ray , making the derivative @xmath53 an indirectly measurable quantity . also , if the proper time in the observer s frame is given by @xmath101 , the changes in @xmath10 and @xmath11 can be compared to the change in time , making the quantities @xmath102 and @xmath103 indirectly measurable as well . with this in mind",
    "we proceed . for simplicity",
    "let us first consider the extended frame of a static observer ( or , rather , multiple neighbouring static observers ) .    to be able to determine the value of @xmath57 through measurements , for a given light ray in the ( @xmath37 ) plane , one must find a relationship between @xmath57 and directly measurable quantities . by definition , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 , for an affine parameter @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath107 be the measurable energy of the photons , and @xmath40 be the measurable angle between the light ray under consideration and a radial light ray passing through this point .",
    "let @xmath39 be the euclidean intersection angle , corresponding to @xmath40 , see figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] for an illustration of the situation .",
    "let @xmath79 be the 4-velocity of the observer and @xmath108 be the 4-momentum of the ray of light under investigation . with the proper time @xmath101 , and an appropriate choice of @xmath45 , @xmath79 and @xmath108 can be expressed as @xmath109 the subscripts @xmath79 and @xmath108 in the coordinates above are introduced for clarity , and will be dropped when there is no room for ambiguity ; clearly we are free to set @xmath110 . with @xmath111 the metric tensor , the measurable energy , @xmath107 ,",
    "can then be expressed in terms of the inner product @xmath112 for the case of a static observer then , where @xmath113 , it is trivial to find @xmath114 from the required condition @xmath115 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath116 @xmath117 here , @xmath107 is a measurable quantity , by definition ; the constant of motion @xmath47 can be determined , from the measurement of @xmath107 , only if both @xmath3 and @xmath0 are known .",
    "further , @xmath118 hence , the constant of motion @xmath46 can be expressed entirely in terms of measurable quantities ( in this case , measurable by a static observer ) , and can be determined without knowledge of @xmath3 or @xmath0 . with the above relationships the parameter @xmath57 can be expressed as follows : @xmath119 and again , we see that this equation can not be used to determine @xmath57 from measurable quantities without a prior knowledge of the value of @xmath0 , and in this case @xmath3 as well .",
    "since the derivative @xmath53 , as well as @xmath103 , can be found at the point of intersection , as discussed , it is possible to determine @xmath39 through @xmath120 and since for the stationary observer , as for any other , the ray moves at the speed of light , set to unity in our coordinates , we have @xmath121 using in the above gives @xmath122 which can be used in to re - express @xmath57 in terms of @xmath39 , then @xmath123 thus , even if the angle @xmath39 can be determined through measurements in an extended frame , one still needs the values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 to calculate @xmath57 .",
    "consider now the measurable angle @xmath40 at the point of intersection , measured by a static observer , which is obviously different from the euclidean angle @xmath39 , as discussed .",
    "the relationship between these angles , derived in the next section , turns out to be @xmath124 in contrast to @xmath39 , the angle @xmath40 can be determined through a direct measurement at a single point by a single observer . to determine @xmath39 an extended frame is needed , which for theoretical reasons is important to consider but may not be practical .",
    "equation can be used to replace @xmath39 by the measurable angle @xmath40 in the last expression of @xmath57 , , giving @xmath125 the above relationship is of simple form and allows finding @xmath57 from the measurable intersection angle @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , this equation can be used to recover the relationship between @xmath57 and @xmath58 , , by setting @xmath74 at @xmath126 , and may be of use in certain applications .",
    "however , once again we see that without the knowledge of @xmath0 ( and @xmath3 ) the value of @xmath57 can not be established . in summary",
    ", we found that out of the three , related , constants of motion @xmath47 , @xmath46 and @xmath57 , it is only the value of @xmath46 that can be established without prior knowledge of @xmath0 form the possible measurements discussed here .",
    "in particular , the value of @xmath57 can not be found without prior knowledge of @xmath0 from such measurements .",
    "these conclusions remain true when considering measurements done by any observer .",
    "the special case of a static observer was considered here only for a simple illustration of the situation .",
    "thus , the answer to the previous question concerning the determination of @xmath57 is in the negative .",
    "the value of @xmath57 can not be established without knowledge of @xmath0 , @xmath57 can not be used as a realistic boundary condition , and finally , due to its dependence on @xmath0 , its use can be misleading when investigating the influence of @xmath0 on other quantities .",
    "we notice that , since it is theoretically possible to measure @xmath40 and determine @xmath39 from measurements , equation can be used to express @xmath0 in terms of measurable quantities .",
    "hence , this suggests one theoretically possible , although maybe not practical , method to find @xmath0 experimentally .",
    "this method of finding @xmath0 is somewhat equivalent to determining the parameter distance and the measurable distance between two points , and using a relationship between the two quantities , similar to equation , to establish the value of @xmath0 .",
    "these effects are a result of the curvature induced by @xmath0 , and can be viewed as the effect of @xmath0 on the embedded surface of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "@xmath0 affects the relationships between measurable quantities and corresponding euclidean ( or coordinate ) quantities .",
    "a visual example of the influence of @xmath0 on such relationships can be seen in figure [ fig4 ] , which is a particularly good illustration when considering measurements made by static observers .",
    "we state again , the possible measurements discussed in this section are for theoretical purposes only , whether or not they are practical is of no concern .",
    "the main goal of this section is to interpret and discuss the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath55 and @xmath57 , and determine which of these can be found through measurements without knowledge of @xmath0 .",
    "we have established the mathematical roles of all three , and found that for a given path of light only @xmath57 depends on @xmath0 ; its value can not be determined without it . while the geometrical interpretation of @xmath58 is clear from its definition , the geometrical interpretation of @xmath55 requires a little more analysis , to be done shortly , which will reveal that @xmath55 is the impact parameter of the trajectory . as for the parameter @xmath57",
    ", there is no clear geometrical interpretation in the general case of @xmath22 and @xmath127 . in the special case where @xmath128",
    ", @xmath57 is the impact parameter , since @xmath129 .",
    "but even when @xmath82 and @xmath23 , @xmath57 loses its geometrical meaning and gains dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in schwarzschild space , the usefulness of @xmath57 comes only from the fact that @xmath129 . in sds space",
    ", the parameter @xmath57 loses its worth .",
    "when discussing some of the recent papers on the topic , we shall have clear definitions of the important quantities in mind . much of the disagreement in the literature seems to emerge from misunderstanding conclusions due to lack of clarity and ambiguity . in many cases , parameters that are defined and often used in analyzing trajectories of light in schwarzschild space",
    "are imported to the analysis in sds space without mentioning their exact definitions or discussing if they remain appropriate to use .",
    "furthermore , even in cases where these imported parameters do remain appropriate to use in sds space , their interpretations may change considerably , which should be noted to avoid confusion . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we present a few definitions in what follows . although the manner in which @xmath0 influences measurements while not having an influence on paths of light should be clear by now from the previous sections , the definitions presented in this section are meant to clarify some of the terminology in the current literature on the topic . the parameters discussed may or may not be of much practical or theoretical use , however",
    ", they encompass some of the popular quantities used in the literature and can aid in making it simple and systematic to understand the results and conclusions of some recent papers .      in the general context",
    ", the impact parameter is defined for a trajectory in a radially dependent potential field , whose first derivative vanishes at large values of the radial coordinate , as the perpendicular distance between an asymptote of the trajectory and the origin .",
    "in such a potential field , trajectories that go to infinity can be approximated by straight lines at large radial coordinate , @xmath10 , and for our purposes we also assume that these trajectories have a point of closest approach to the origin with a minimum value of @xmath10 .",
    "see the following figure .    )",
    "plane under the influence of a radially dependent potential field .",
    "the solid curve represents the trajectory of interest , the dashed line represents one of its asymptotes .",

    "plane with a point of closest approach .",
    "the solid curve represents the path of interest , the dashed line represents one of its asymptotes , and the solid line is a radial line parallel to the asymptote .",
    "the impact parameter equals the limit of the distance @xmath131 , appearing on the diagram , as @xmath132.,width=321 ]    we see that this second definition suggests an experimental method to find the impact parameter for a given , fixed , path of light . for example , in schwarzschild space , which is asymptotically flat , radial lines can , in principle , be identified , and the required distance corresponding to the impact parameter of figure [ ip2 ] can , theoretically , be measured directly by static observers .",
    "thus , in addition to the fact that the impact parameter can be calculated from some boundary conditions , in schwarzschild space it can also be found from direct measurements as well . when extending the concept of the impact parameter to trajectories of light in sds space , which are mathematically the same as in schwarzschild space , both of the two common definitions remain valid .",
    "however , in this case , the second definition no longer suggests a method to measure the impact parameter directly , as it does for schwarzschild space , since the space is no longer asymptotically flat .",
    "thus , the impact parameter of trajectories of light in sds space can still be calculated from some boundary conditions , which determine the trajectory , but can no longer be measured directly .",
    "the impact parameter can be found analytically as follows .",
    "first , let us refer to figure [ ip2 ] and orient the angular coordinate , @xmath11 , so that the radial line will corresponds to @xmath133 .",
    "far from the origin , the perpendicular coordinate distance between a point on the path under investigation and the radial line is @xmath134 , where the coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 are of a point on the path ( with @xmath135 ) .",
    "therefore , the impact parameter is the limit of @xmath136 as @xmath10 approaches infinity .",

    "@xmath137 and so we find that the impact parameter of a given fixed trajectory is the constant of motion @xmath55 .",
    "this gives us the geometrical significance of @xmath55 , but again , since sds space is not asymptotically flat , the value of @xmath55 can not be measured directly , though it could easily be found analytically from boundary conditions .",
    "the facts to keep in mind when bringing up the concept of the impact parameter in the context of trajectories of light in sds space are the following : in the special case of @xmath128 , the space is asymptotically flat and we have @xmath129 , so not only does @xmath57 become the impact parameter , but also the impact parameter becomes directly measurable at large distances .",
    "however , these two features do not remain true for @xmath23 .",

    "we see again a similarity with the case of the impact parameter . the bending angle can be found from some boundary conditions that determine the path , and therefore can be determined from measurable quantities , but can no longer be measured directly . in particular , the bending angle can be found by taking the limit as @xmath10 goes to infinity in the solution for the orientation in figure [ split1 ] , and since the path does not depend on @xmath0 the bending angle",
    "does not depend on @xmath0 either .",
    "it is clear from the symmetry that the bending angle should only depend on @xmath3 and @xmath58 , and since these parameters only appear as the combination @xmath156 in the analysis , the bending angle will be a function of @xmath156 .",

    "but , given the discussion of the parameter @xmath57 in this section , we see that this relationship will be of little use and , in a way , misleading . finally , it is important to keep in mind that , in the case of sds space , the bending angle should be interpreted only as a euclidean quantity , which belongs to the flat ( @xmath37 ) plane . since paths of light are independent of @xmath0 , extending the bending angle to sds space in such a way does not affect its mathematical interpretation .",
    "now , however , only in the special case of @xmath128 the bending angle gains a physical significance as well by becoming equivalent to a measurable quantity .      in light of the definition 2 of the bending angle in schwarzschild space",

    "the way in which the measurable angle , @xmath40 , is related to its corresponding euclidean angle , @xmath39 , is illustrated in figure [ fig4 ] ; @xmath40 is the projection of @xmath39 onto the embedded surface discussed in section [ sec2 ] . the angle @xmath40 is physically measurable by using the radial ray at @xmath149 as a reference , which in the euclidean sense is parallel to the direction of the path at @xmath58 , and for this reason it is a measure of the deflection of the path as it goes from ( @xmath52 ) to @xmath149 .",
    "if the mass at the centre of coordinates is luminous , as is usually the case in practice , then radial reference rays are available at all points to all observers . since the observer and the point of measurement are set in the definition , the measurable angle @xmath40 can be considered as a function of @xmath58 only , in addition to @xmath3 and @xmath0 , of course .",

    "@xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 , only the bending angle @xmath179 does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the other three angles are progressive generalizations , they are measurable and all depend on @xmath0 , as should be expected given the previous discussions .",
    "we have considered creating a table that summarizes the above mentioned parameters and categorizes them based on their dependence on @xmath0 and way of measurement , but decided against it for the following reasons .",
    "the three parameters @xmath55 , @xmath58 and @xmath57 are discussed to exhaustion , and the angular quantities are mentioned here for the purpose of their exact definition that is accompanied by an adequate discussion .",
    "simply put , the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath58 and @xmath57 have important physical and geometrical interpretations that should be abundantly clear by now and kept in mind throughout the rest of our presentation , and when we later refer to the angular parameters @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and @xmath182 it is our intention that their exact definitions and our discussion of them will be read and understood .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note that in the case where @xmath58 is the _ radius _ of a static star , and is determined from other theoretical considerations , its value still does not depend on @xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this section is to find an expression for a measurable intersection angle for a given observer associated with two null geodesics in terms of the three 4-vectors representing the 4-velocity of the observer and the two tangent 4-vectors of the null geodesics evaluated at the point of intersection . of course",
    ", since the motivation for the derivation of such an expression sprang out of the investigation of light rays in sds space , being the central theme of this work , we shall attempt to keep our attention on it throughout this section .",
    "however , some of the results derived here are far reaching in their applicability , and may themselves be of much greater significance than their application to sds space . before considering the case of a general observer in sds space , as a warm up , we derive the expression of a measurable intersection angle by a static observer in terms of the euclidean intersection angle appearing on the flat ( @xmath37 ) plane .",
    "this derivation is particularly informative and serves as an intuitive way to illustrate the influence of @xmath0 on measurable angles .",
    "although we should always assume that the background spacetime is sds , it is noteworthy that the following derivation only assumes a spherically symmetric , static metric that is locally minkowski . in",
    "spherical coordinates ( @xmath183 ) , we may assume that @xmath10 is the areal radius , and the metric can be written as in equation .",
    "further , the coordinate @xmath10 is restricted to a region where @xmath90 in is positive , and without loss of generality we restrict all motion and measurements to the slice @xmath15 .",

    "the influence of @xmath0 in this case is clear and comes from the reference to equation .",
    "let us consider a different approach to the problem .",
    "we have already established that the local space around the static observer can be represented by metric in the coordinates ( @xmath37 ) , as well as the flat metric in local minkowski coordinates . the intersection angle measured between two trajectories of light with 4-velocities @xmath108 and @xmath177 is the angle sustained by the projections of @xmath108 and @xmath177 onto the local space of the observer . for a static observer ,",

    ", we have in general @xmath206 intuitively , since the angle @xmath40 belongs to the minkowski space of the observer , we may consider the vectors in to exist in this minkowski space and to be written in the @xmath142 and @xmath148 coordinates , with the inner products taking place in the ( @xmath143 ) plane .",
    "however , since inner products are coordinate independent , there is no need to use any coordinates other than the given ( @xmath37 ) to establish a relationship from for a particular situation .",
    "equation can be used for any given 4-vectors @xmath108 and @xmath177 , the projected vectors @xmath191 and @xmath192 can be found , for a static observer , simply by eliminating the @xmath9 component in each of the 4-vectors .",

    "thus , we have derived equation as a special case of equation .",
    "a similar reasoning to the one used in establishing equation will be employed in the derivation of the general relation , applicable to any observer , which is the main goal of this section . in the meanwhile ,",
    "we notice that with an established relationship for a static observer one can construct a relationship for any other observer by using the aberration equation to relate the measurable angles .",
    "this fact is important and may be of practical use , however , it may be inconvenient in some cases to refer to a static observer that is not part of the setup .",

    "the following is a derivation of the general formula for the measurable intersection angle by any observer .",
    "the final result is the main goal of this section and , perhaps , the result of most importance in this paper . for the sake of generality",

    "@xmath324 this makes it slightly tempting to use the parameter @xmath57 to simplify equation .",

    "@xmath58 can be given by other existing theories or sources , which sets a convenient boundary condition and can be used directly in the above relationships , eliminating the need for a solution .",
    "further , if we also confine the motion of the observer to the plane of the rays , setting @xmath337 , the condition @xmath115 gives @xmath338 therefore ,    @xmath339    and @xmath340    the effects of @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and the velocity component , @xmath341 , on the measured angle can be studied from the above relationship , which can be considerably simplified with some standard approximations .",
    "no assumptions were taken regarding the sign of @xmath336 .",

    "the above equation is exact , given , and can be considerably simplified by making approximations related to the relative magnitudes of @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath10 and @xmath58 . of course ,",
    "due to the chosen orientation , the above relationship , as well as , can also be obtained by means of the usual aberration equation , , and the expression for @xmath332 , .",
    "the required relative speed in the aberration equation can be obtained through the same method leading to equations .",
    "notice that the effects of @xmath0 in this case come from both the geometry and the velocity of the observer . whether a positive @xmath0 diminishes or increases the measurable angle for such an observer can be studied from the above equation , for this particular orientation of rays . to address this question in a more general setup",
    ", equation can be employed to produce similar relationships to for any orientation of interest .",
    "also notice that in the cosmological context , where the deflecting mass may be a distant galaxy , the values of the coordinate @xmath10 and the parameter @xmath58 are determined indirectly , and may or may not depend on @xmath0 themselves as well . in the simplest case , @xmath58 can be at the edge of the deflecting galaxy , and can be found from other existing methods or tabulated data on the particular galaxy .",
    "in other cases , @xmath58 must be determined from other boundary conditions , which depending on the model and coordinates used , may themselves depend on @xmath0 directly or necessitate the appearance of @xmath0 in their relation to @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , in the cosmological context , in a realistic case where all measurements can only be done by an observer at one point ( such as on earth in our galaxy ) , the determination of @xmath10 and @xmath58 from such measurable quantities and the dependence of these measurements on @xmath0 are issues that , on their own , deserve a detailed investigation . in order to avoid deviating too far off course ,",
    "this investigation , which makes extensive use of our formula , was reserved for a separate report , @xcite . for",
    "now , however , we can learn much from the results derived in this section on the influence of @xmath0 and investigate the ways in which its value can be determined experimentally from some measurements of angles .",
    "the relationships obtained in this section can be used to study the influence of different parameters on measurable angles and reveal many interesting results .",
    "various experiments concerned with the determination of @xmath0 from angle measurements can be analyzed , and even suggested , by means of these relationships .",
    "+ finally , it is clear that the results derived in this section are indispensable for a general analysis , which involves finding measurable intersection angles of light rays in sds space .",
    "equation is a general , mathematical , result , while equation specifically applies to the @xmath15 slice of sds space and a particular orientation of light rays . of course",
    ", by means of equation , we can generalize the expressions to two arbitrary light rays in the plane of motion , without constricting one of the rays to be radial .",
    "even further , we can generalize to arbitrary light rays confined to two different planes .",
    "however , due to the popularity of the usual conditions that lead to equation , let us summarize by restating equations and , which constitute the complete set of tools needed to analyze paths of light and associated measurable angles in sds space . @xmath358 and @xmath359 the fact that we chose to use the parameter @xmath58 in the above expressions makes them particularly useful in applications involving symmetric trajectories with a point of closest approach , which is by far the most popular case in the literature on the topic .",
    "however , the equations above are not limited to such situations .",
    "when there is no point of closest approach , @xmath58 can be replaced by the impact parameter @xmath55 ( or some other parameter ) in both equations .",
    "although we have argued that in sds spacetime it may be more appropriate to choose the parameter @xmath58 over @xmath55 in expressions , from a mathematical perspective the parameter @xmath55 is more general and its use may sometimes be necessary .    to be clear , a general analysis of the kind discussed above can be carried out from basic principles by means of the euler - lagrange equations and equation .",
    "these two tools , together with some boundary conditions , are all that is needed for a complete analysis and can be used for any setup and any coordinates . for the specific case of the @xmath15 slice of sds space in kottler coordinates , the differential equation governing a trajectory of light , given by euler - lagrange equations , reduces to and the expression for a measurable angle , given by equation , with reference to a radial light ray , becomes . until recently",
    ", equation was generally regarded as the main tool in investigating the influence of @xmath0 , and measurable angles were mainly found through euclidean methods justified in certain approximations .",
    "rindler and ishak s work promoted attention to other sources through which @xmath0 can influence mathematical results . the present work , however , is the first to introduce equation to this topic , which now contains the necessary and sufficient tools needed to analyze the influence of @xmath0 on measurements correctly for any observer .",
    "especially when investigating the influence of @xmath0 on measurable angles , it is clear that equation on its own is not enough .",
    "equation , in some sense , brings the concept of measurement into the analysis , and as we ve seen , this is where @xmath0 makes an entrance .",
    "let us re - emphasise that although @xmath0 does not explicitly enter the analysis through the governing differential equation , , it still influences the geometry through the metric which in turn affects measurements .",
    "this influence on the geometry is accounted for in the derivation of equation , through which @xmath0 enters the analysis explicitly .",
    "furthermore , in situations where @xmath58 is determined from boundary conditions that may depend on @xmath0 , @xmath0 can enter the analysis through @xmath58 in both equations and . additionally , as we ve already seen , @xmath0 may also enter the analysis through the components of @xmath79 , which are not all independent due to the normality requirement and",
    "may depend on @xmath0 themselves through other ways .",
    "the most important lesson here is that the influence of @xmath0 can come from various sources , making it hard to propose general conclusions on some important issues in this topic .",
    "the influence is sensitive to a particular situation that is being analyzed , and this allows for a various possibilities of how @xmath0 appears in results of interest .",

    "( 10 ) of @xcite ) @xmath363 their @xmath364 and @xmath3 correspond exactly to ours of the previous sections .",
    "they note that other authors used the parameter @xmath57 in such discussions , but argued that while @xmath57 is meaningful in schwarzschild space it is not the case in sds space , which is not asymptotically flat .",
    "next , the authors pointed out that while their solution equally applies to both schwarzschild space and sds space , only in the case of schwarzschild space the bending angle can be found by letting @xmath10 go to infinity in the solution ; in sds space this limit makes no sense .",
    "this way of finding the bending angle corresponds to our definition 1 of section [ sec4b ] , which we discussed in detail and compared to other definitions .",
    "the authors then explain the need for other angles in describing the deflection of a path of light .",
    "this is an issue to which we dedicated much attention ourselves , and is the main reason for including the detailed definitions of section [ sec4b ] in the present work .",
    "the authors then proceed by observing that a measurable angle is found correctly through the invariant formula    ( eq .",
    "( 11 ) of @xcite , in original notation ) @xmath365 here the metric tensor components , @xmath366 , are those of the line element in our section [ sec2 ] , @xmath130 and @xmath367 are the tangents of the deflected ray and a radial ray , respectively , on the ( @xmath37 ) plane , and @xmath368 is the measured angle . notice that the above equation is identical to equation of our section [ sec5a ] .",
    "this is the key step in accounting for the contribution of the geometry to the measurable angle of interest , and this is precisely where @xmath0 pays its role .",
    "in fact , this step is what separates rindler and ishak s work from all the preceding attempts to investigate the influence of @xmath0 on measurements associated with light rays in sds space .    with their solution to the deflected trajectory ,",
    ", they find an expression for @xmath53 and designate it by @xmath369 .",
    "this allows them to write an expression for the measurable intersection angle , @xmath368 , as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath11 as follows ,    ( eq .",

    "( 16 ) of @xcite ) @xmath371 where @xmath372 notice how equation is identical to our equations and of section [ sec5a ] .",
    "at this point , the authors did not make use of their approximate solution yet , which does not carry any terms of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , without the need of any approximations which the authors proceeded with , the main point of their argument is established by the expressions for the measurable angle @xmath368 , where @xmath0 explicitly appears through @xmath90 .",
    "the authors then made a definition of the _ one - sided bending angle _ as follows , @xmath373 here @xmath374 is the one - sided bending angle , @xmath368 is the measurable angle with the radial and @xmath11 is the angular position coordinate of the observer .",
    "the reasoning for this definition comes from their figure 2 , the important features of which can be seen in our figures [ split1 ] , [ split2 ] and [ fig10a ] .",
    "this definition is similar to our definitions of @xmath163 , the _",
    "measurable deflection angle by a static observer _ , of section [ sec4b ] , and its euclidean counterpart @xmath164 .",
    "more on this in what follows . finally , by using their approximate solution , , the authors obtained explicit results for the specific cases of @xmath133 and @xmath375 , under the assumption that @xmath374 is small , see equations ( 17 ) and ( 19 ) in @xcite .",
    "the results are expressed in terms of @xmath362 , @xmath3 and @xmath0 , which allows them to discuss the influence of @xmath0 and compare the newly defined bending angle to the case of schwarzschild space .",
    "rindler and ishak s approach to this topic is quite original and turns out to be very significant .",
    "they brought the concept of measurement into the picture and modified the current view regarding the influence of @xmath0 .",
    "however , let us summarize the drawbacks that we find in the following three points .",
    "first , as we already stated , the use of an approximate solution is not needed for the main argument .",
    "the influence of @xmath0 on an important measurable quantity is clear from equation .",
    "moreover , there is no need to define a new parameter @xmath362 and use it in final results ; this task is best fulfilled by the parameter @xmath58 , which has a clear and useful geometrical interpretation .",
    "second , the authors never address the question of which observer is making the measurement . in the context of the present work the answer is obvious",
    ", it is the static observer that is implicitly taken in all the expressions for measurable angles in @xcite .",
    "however , not mentioning it explicitly , in a way , hides the fact that measurable angles are observer dependent , and the influence of @xmath0 through the 4-velocity of the observer may be as important to study as the influence of @xmath0 through the metric itself .",
    "this lack of clarity , described by the latter point , may have been a cause for some arguments by other authors who responded to @xcite , see @xcite @xcite .",
    "lastly , upon closer examination of equation , we find that the definition of the one - sided bending angle , @xmath374 , is somewhat peculiar , in the following sense . on the right hand side of the equation ,",
    "the angle @xmath368 is directly measurable , while the angle @xmath11 is purely euclidean . in other words",
    ", @xmath368 belongs to the local frame of the particular observer , while @xmath11 is a euclidean angle that belongs to a diagram on the ( @xmath37 ) plane .",
    "this observation was not commented on in any of the preceding papers that respond to @xcite , whether in agreement or disagreement .",
    "although not of major consequence , this definition of a bending angle leads to some problems . let us discuss this issue in the context of our section [ sec4b ] and write equation in our notation",
    "to this end , we refer to figure [ fig10a ] of section [ sec4b ] and consider the angles in it .",
    "@xmath164 is the euclidean angle between the bending trajectory and the vector @xmath146 , @xmath165 is the euclidean angle between a radial trajectory and the vector @xmath146 , and @xmath166 is the euclidean angle between a radial trajectory and the bending trajectory .",
    "their measurable counterparts , by a static observer , are @xmath163 @xmath168 @xmath169 , respectively . the ambiguity that arises with the vector @xmath146",
    "is dealt with in the precise definition of @xmath163 in section [ sec4b ] .",
    "as explained , we have chosen the reference to the vector @xmath146 due to the fact that at @xmath74 the tangent of the trajectory is parallel to this vector , and in this sense the angle between the trajectory and the vector @xmath146 is a measure of the one - sided deflection .",
    "it seems that rindler and ishak followed similar reasoning in their definition .",
    "now , in terms of the angles mentioned above , a measure of the deflection we are interested in is provided by either @xmath164 or @xmath163 , of which only one is physically measurable , although both can be determined analytically .",
    "a straightforward way to find these angles is through @xmath167 and @xmath376 , which is where the importance of the angles @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 comes in and why defining these angles is necessary . in the spirit of analyzing the effect of @xmath0 on measurements",
    ", we used the angle @xmath163 rather than @xmath164 in defining the deflection angle at a given point , and emphasised that it is measurable . perhaps in the same spirit , rindler and ishak defined their one - sided bending angle , @xmath374 , with reference to the measurable angle @xmath368 . to compare our definitions ,",
    "let us relate the angles that are used in defining @xmath374 to the angles of figure [ fig10a ] . clearly , @xmath377 and @xmath378 .",
    "thus , using our notation we can define an identical deflection angle to the one defined by rindler and ishak as @xmath379 . to summarize , by using the angles @xmath165 , @xmath166 and their measurable counterparts @xmath168 and @xmath169 , we have defined three angular quantities that serve as a measure of the deflection of a light ray at a given point .",
    "these are : @xmath380 @xmath381 @xmath382 it is not clear as to why rindler and ishak chose this particular definition .",
    "mixing measurable and euclidean angles makes it hard to interpret results and discuss their significance .",
    "the angle @xmath383 itself is neither measurable nor does it appear on a diagram that depicts the situation being analyzed .",
    "hence , the geometrical significance of the euclidean angle @xmath164 and the physical significance of the measurable @xmath163 are absent in the hybrid angle @xmath383 .",
    "notice , however , that in the special case of @xmath133 , which leads to equation ( 17 ) of @xcite , our bending angle , @xmath163 , and rindler and ishak s bending angle @xmath383 are equal , since in this case @xmath384 .",
    "this is the case when the measurement is taken at the point of symmetry , in the language of section [ sec4b ] , for which we defined the angle @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , while equation ( 17 ) of @xcite makes perfect sense , equation ( 19 ) of @xcite , obtained for the case @xmath375 , must be interpreted with extra care and its usefulness is not immediately clear .",
    "another problem with the definition of @xmath383 is that paths which are straight lines on the ( @xmath37 ) plane may have a non - zero bending angle .",
    "a few examples can be thought of to demonstrate this fact , the simplest of which is perhaps a trajectory of light for the special case @xmath82 .",
    "overall , this non - zero bending angle occurrence can be seen from the fact that while @xmath385 for the case of a straight line , the angle @xmath383 becomes a difference between a euclidean angle and its measurable counterpart , which in general is non - zero when the space is curved .",
    "thus , in light of the discussion of section [ sec4b ] , concerning the requirements of quantities that represent deflection angles in schwarzschild , sds and de sitter spaces , we see that the quantity @xmath383 , originally @xmath374 , does not meet some of our expectations . + before ending our discussion of rindler and ishak s work , for the sake of later argument , let us quote some important results that we obtained by means of rindler and ishak s methods presented in @xcite .",
    "these results are derived in detail in @xcite , where we investigate the contribution of @xmath0 to the lens equation .",
    "the first order solution given by is all that is needed to obtain the , well know , first order single source lens equation , eq . .",
    "@xmath386 referring to figure [ lensing ] of the appendix , the above relationship serves as a map between the distance @xmath148 on the lensed plane and the angular position @xmath387 at the point of observation , in terms of @xmath3 and the euclidean parameters @xmath388 , @xmath389 and @xmath390 .",
    "see the appendix for more details .",
    "the above relationship can be modified by utilization of equation ( arguably the equation of most significance in @xcite ) to replace the euclidean parameters on the right hand side with measurable parameters .",
    "the result is a map between @xmath148 and the measurable position angle @xmath391 , in terms of angular diameter distances , all measured by a static observer .",
    "@xmath392 see the appendix for more details .",
    "the above agrees with our equation .",
    "notice the presence of @xmath0 in the above equation , which came about due the use of measurable parameters .",
    "next , equation can be further modified by employing the standard aberration equation to convert the quantities that are measurable by a static observer to quantities that are measurable by a comoving observer , which has a relative velocity of @xmath393 and is moving in the radial direction . the result is a map between @xmath148 and the measurable position angle @xmath391 , using angular diameter distances , all measured by a comoving observer .",
    "@xmath394 the above agrees with our equation .",
    "notice the appearance of @xmath0 in the above equation and how it differs from . due to the assumption of comoving motion ,",
    "the above can be regarded as a cosmological gravitational lens equation for a single source , and it is noteworthy that it was derived by means of rindler and ishak s methods of @xcite combined with the standard aberration equation .",
    "much of the criticism of rindler and ishak s conclusions is based on the fact that with a positive @xmath0 the source , observer and lens should be in relative , comoving , motion , which is not accounted for in @xcite .",
    "we shall use this last result when responding to some of the comments made in @xcite in a later section .      in this part",
    "we summarize and respond to some aspects of the paper published by m. sereno in 2008 , titled  influence of the cosmological constant on gravitational lensing in small systems \" , @xcite .",
    "since then , the author has published the follow - up papers @xcite and @xcite on the topic , to which the following discussion also applies .",
    "although the author supports the conclusions of rindler and ishak , the analysis in @xcite provides an example of the misuse of the parameter @xmath57 , which leads to a questionable interpretation of results .    in this paper ,",
    "the author begins with a brief introduction in which he mentions rindler and ishak s work , @xcite .",
    "he begins his analysis with the kottler metric , our equation , and proceeds to write down the orbital equation for a light ray in ( @xmath37 ) space in terms of the parameter @xmath57 in integral from :    ( eq .",
    "( 3 ) of @xcite , in original notation ) @xmath395^{-\\frac{1}{2}}. \\label{ser : equ}\\ ] ] here @xmath396 is the @xmath11 coordinate of the source , and the integral is to be taken from the @xmath10 coordinate of the source , @xmath397 , to the @xmath10 coordinate of the observer , @xmath398 ( in the original notation ) .",
    "also , the observer is assumed to be positioned at @xmath399 , without loss of generality .",
    "the parameter @xmath400 .",
    "the above equation is equivalent to our equation , which we have discussed extensively , and which can also be written in terms of the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath58 ( in our notation ) .",
    "although the author defined the parameters @xmath401 and @xmath402 , which are identical to our @xmath55 and @xmath58 , respectively , he never used either in the expression of his solution to the orbital equation .",
    "the advantages in using either @xmath55 or @xmath58 instead of the parameter @xmath57 are discussed in detail throughout our sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] .",
    "we have shown that the parameter @xmath57 can not be considered independent of @xmath0 , and its use in results can be misleading when investigating the influence of @xmath0 .",
    "the author then proceeds to write an approximate solution to his equation ( 3 ) ( our above ) , expended in orders of @xmath403 and @xmath404 , which are both represented by @xmath374 for simplicity .",
    "( 5 ) of @xcite , in original notation ) @xmath405 although it appears somewhat complicated , his solution is essentially a relationship between @xmath396 and @xmath397 in terms of @xmath3 , @xmath398 , @xmath57 and @xmath0 .",
    "this relationship is a function that represents a set of points which constitute the path of a light ray in ( @xmath37 ) space . in light of our investigation of section [ sec3 ] , and given the fact that the boundary conditions the author considers are purely coordinate - like , we know that the path of light connecting the source and observer is independent of @xmath0",
    ". in other words , the set of points in ( @xmath37 ) space that constitute the path of a light ray does not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the appearance of @xmath0 in the authors solution is entirely due to his choice of using the parameter @xmath57 , which itself depends on @xmath0 .",
    "the perfect cancellation of the @xmath0 terms in equation that one would expect when transforming @xmath57 to either @xmath401 or @xmath402 is completely hidden by the approximation taken .",
    "in fact , a solution to can be written without @xmath0 , even without the use of @xmath401 or @xmath402 , since either of which can be expressed in terms of the mass @xmath3 , and the boundary conditions ( @xmath406 ) and ( @xmath407 ) , without invoking @xmath0 .",
    "thus , if done correctly and with no approximations on @xmath0 the solution to the orbital equation should not contain any terms of @xmath0 at all .",
    "this is in contradiction with the conclusion made by the author following his equation ( 5 ) .",
    "although sereno s conclusions seem to be in agreement with those of rindler and ishak , we see that rindler and ishak took a completely different approach to this topic .",
    "they acknowledged the work of islam and that @xmath0 should not contribute to the orbital equation or its solution , and they brought @xmath0 into the analysis through considerations of measurements .",
    "sereno , on the other hand , without considering measurements , brought @xmath0 into the orbital equation by using the parameter @xmath57 . moreover , his approximation masked the fact that @xmath0 can be transformed away from the equation by using a more appropriate parameter , such as @xmath401 or @xmath402 .",
    "in fact , if we compare sereno s solution , , to rindler and ishak s solution , , we see while @xmath0 appears in one it does not appear in the other , which is quite a major conceptual disagreement .",
    "rindler and ishak argued against the use of the parameter @xmath57 , which led them to define their parameter @xmath362 .",
    "the main point here is that when investigating the appearance of @xmath0 in relationships of interest , the choice of the parameters used in these relationships is crucial ; the advantage in using parameters that are independent of @xmath0 themselves is obvious .",
    "in this part we summarize and respond to some aspects of the paper published by a. bhadra , s. biswas and k. sarkar in 2010 , titled  gravitational deflection of light in the schwarzschild - de sitter space - time \" , @xcite .",
    "the authors of this paper seem to support rindler and ishak s conclusions , but there are a number of issues we find with their analysis that we shall discuss .",
    "the authors begin by presenting the idea that @xmath0 does affect the orbit of a photon , as well as the resulting bending angle ; unfortunately , a common idea on that side of the argument , @xcite @xcite .",
    "the authors mention rindler and ishak s original work , @xcite , and briefly discuss the ongoing debate regarding their conclusions .",
    "the position they seem to take is that , in addition to what was found by rindler and ishak , there is more to the contribution of @xmath0 , which comes from the orbital equation .",
    "they begin their analysis by sating the kottler metric , our equation , and the orbital equation in ( @xmath37 ) space in terms of the parameter @xmath57 , our equation . in defining their @xmath57 , which is identical to our @xmath57",
    ", they state that it behaves as the impact parameter at large distances , which is incorrect .",

    ", the authors used the exact same approximation as in @xcite , and even used the same parameter @xmath362 , see equation .",
    "however , they claimed that , ultimately , the parameter @xmath362 must be replaced with @xmath57 and @xmath0 , since it is @xmath57 and @xmath0 that appear in the first order orbital equation and carry meaning . the relationship between @xmath362 , @xmath57 and @xmath0 can be easily obtained by plugging the solution into the differential equation , or simply by combining equations and . in either case , we find @xmath410 the above relationship is in disagreement with the one stated by the authors :    ( eq .",
    "( 6 ) of @xcite ) @xmath411 the derivation of this equation is not explicit , so the source of error is not clear .",
    "thus , in addition to proposing the use of @xmath57 and @xmath0 instead of @xmath362 , the authors propose an incorrect relationship to make the transformation .",
    "furthermore , the authors claim that by virtue of equations and , the parameter @xmath58 depends on @xmath0 as well .",

    "however , following their equation ( 12 ) , the authors of @xcite explain that rindler and ishak s decision to put the observer at @xmath133 in the procedure of @xcite is not justified , and ultimately conclude that the angle should be expressed in terms of the arbitrary , but far from the origin , locations of the observer and the source , ( @xmath415 ) and ( @xmath416 ) , respectively ( in original notation ) .",

    "notice that @xmath58 in the above expression can be found from @xmath418 , @xmath419 , @xmath420 and @xmath396 , without invoking @xmath0 , which makes it somewhat of an unnecessary parameter in this situation .",
    "replacing @xmath58 in terms of these boundary conditions will not change the appearance of @xmath0 in the expression .",
    "however , the authors set forth to replace @xmath58 with the parameter @xmath57 , by approximating the exact relationship given by to first orders in @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",

    "similar to the case of section [ sec6a ] , and of no surprise , the deflection angle of equations and is non - zero for trajectories that are straight lines .",
    "finally , in light of our own investigation in the previous sections , it is worth saying that in the analysis of @xcite the key contribution of @xmath0 comes from equation and should not come from equation at all . as noted by the authors in a following paragraph",
    ", the difference between their results and the ones obtained in @xcite is primarily due to the fact that they included @xmath0 in the orbit equation as well , by making use of the parameter @xmath57 .",

    "the choice of @xmath55 over @xmath57 in the solution by rindler and ishak , for example , led to the conclusion that @xmath0 has no influence on the orbit , as was also concluded by islam and many others .",
    "( to first order in @xmath3 , rindler and ishak s @xmath362 equals our @xmath55 , see equation . ) next , in order to compare to previously derived results , including equation of the previous section , the authors replaced @xmath55 with @xmath57 , and expended the expression to lowest orders of @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "( 14 ) of @xcite , in original notation ) @xmath427 here , @xmath428 .",
    "although they point out some agreement that they find in their comparison , it is important to make a clear distinction between the method used to derive the above and the method used to derive , for example . in deriving the above , no reference to any real measurements and any possible observers",
    "the influence of @xmath0 , therefore , comes only from the use of the parameter @xmath57 . on the other hand , in deriving ,",
    "a truly measurable angle was considered ( @xmath368 ) , which brought in the contribution of @xmath0 through its influence on the geometry , introducing factors that can not be transformed away .",
    "the reason for any similarities between the two equations is due to the use of @xmath57 , and the appearance of @xmath0 that is carried with it , in both methods .",
    "thus , one must be careful when interpreting and comparing such relationships .",
    "overall , up to this point , the authors did not address real measurements at all , which is what sparked the whole debate on the influence of @xmath0 .",
    "two important points to take from this are that the choice of parameters affects the appearance of @xmath0 in results of interest ( once again ) , and that the choice of parameters must be stated explicitly in order to avoid confusion and ambiguity when making final conclusions .",
    "it is also important to note that the particular way in which the bending angle , @xmath218 , was defined in @xcite is exactly what rindler and ishak were trying to avoid in @xcite when extending the concept to light rays in sds space , due to the conceptual problem with the limit @xmath132 .",
    "while rindler and ishak resorted to measurable angles , through which the contribution of @xmath0 was found , the authors of @xcite showed that @xmath0 appears in results of interest only when using the parameter @xmath57 .",
    "the authors then proceed with their investigation and also found that , in regards to the cosmological lens equation , the effect of @xmath0 is completely absorbed in an angular diameter distance ; an issue to which the discussion of the next section applies , and which we address in full detail in @xcite .      in this part",
    "we summarize and respond to the paper published by m. park in 2008 , titled  rigorous approach to gravitational lensing \" , @xcite .",
    "the author of this paper takes a different approach to the topic at hand than the ones we ve seen in the papers discussed above . rather than concerning with the contribution of @xmath0 to quantities such as the bending angle ,",
    "the author directly derived a cosmological lens equation that accounts for @xmath0 and the relative comoving motion between the observer , source and the massive object .",
    "some of the results derived in @xcite are central to our response to @xcite , which is the main reason for having them included in the appendix .",
    "the author used an original method to analyze the standard setup of gravitational lensing by a single source .",
    "he ultimately derived the lens equation for a comoving observer in sds space from first principles .",
    "the lens equation applies to a comoving observer in the sense that the measurable parameters that appear in the equation are measurable by this observer .",
    "such an equation is useful in the cosmological context , where the objects involved are distant galaxies , for example .",
    "the author started his analysis from the mcvittie metric , @xcite , equation ( 1 ) in @xcite , and specialized it to sds spacetime by setting all the cosmological parameters except @xmath0 to zero , resulting in a scale factor @xmath429 , with @xmath430 .",
    "he then transformed to more convenient spatial coordinates , which later allow him to express angular diameter distances in an easy way . using these coordinates he approximated the components of the metric to first order in @xmath3 , and expressed it as follows :    ( eq .",
    "( 7 ) of @xcite , in original notation ) @xmath431 his spatial coordinates , ( @xmath217 ) , are centred on a point away from the massive object . in these coordinates ,",
    "the origin is a point which can describe the location of comoving observer at any time @xmath9 .",
    "the massive object ( lens ) is positioned on the @xmath142-axis , without loss of generality , and moves away from the origin in accordance to hubble flow .",
    "his parameter @xmath432 is just an arbitrary constant associated to his transformation .",
    "it can be set by knowing the relative locations of the observer ( at the origin ) and the lens at a given time .",
    "note that his time - like coordinate @xmath9 is different to our @xmath9 in the kottler metric , .",
    "far from the mass , the @xmath9 in coincides with the proper time of a comoving observer , which is the frw time coordinate in that limit . also note that his @xmath3 is twice that of our @xmath3 in all preceding discussion ; we will make it clear when using our notation or the notation of @xcite .",
    "working to first order in @xmath3 and confining the motion of the photon to the @xmath433 plane ( @xmath434 ) , the author formed a diagram describing the lensing setup , and found the trajectory of a light ray , satisfying the required boundary conditions .",
    "see figure 1 in @xcite , which is similar to our figure [ lensing ] in the appendix .",
    "he proceeded to write an expression for the intersection angle @xmath12 at the origin , between the light ray coming from the source and the light ray coming from the lens , equation ( 26 ) in @xcite .",
    "since this angle occurs at the origin on his diagram , by the construction of his spatial coordinates , it is equivalent to the measurable angle by an observer located at the origin , a comoving observer in the frw sense .",
    "this allowed the author to establish the cosmological lens equation .",
    "( 29 ) of @xcite , in original notation ) @xmath435 in this equation , the distance - like parameters @xmath436 and @xmath437 are angular diameter distances , measured by the observer at the origin .",
    "they precisely correspond to the coordinate distances used in the derivation , which explains the author s choice of transformation .",
    "hence , the author does account for measurements by virtue of choosing his coordinates such that some euclidean angles and coordinate distances that appear on the diagram are equivalent to some important measurable angles and distances that are needed to express final results .",
    "note that this method of incorporating measurable quantities into the analysis can only work for a comoving observer , in a region far from the mass where its effects are completely negligible .",
    "the angle @xmath438 in the above equation is the undeflected position angle that the observer would measure in the absence of the mass .",
    "let us put equation in the notation of the appendix by transforming the parameters accordingly .",
    "@xmath439 @xmath440 @xmath441 @xmath442 to first order in @xmath3 and @xmath391 , equation written in our notation is : @xmath443 this equation can be solved for @xmath148 and compared to the relationships stated in the appendix",
    ". again , to first order in @xmath3 and @xmath391 , we find @xmath444 the above is the cosmological gravitational lens equation , expressed entirely in terms of directly measurable parameters ; it assumes the measurements are taken by a comoving observer .",
    "this equation is in perfect agreement with our equation , which is an approximation of equation , obtained by series expansion in @xmath0 .",
    "this leads us to conclude that park s result is correct to the highest order of his approximation .",
    "it is worth noting that our approach in deriving in @xcite is significantly different than the method used by park to derive .",
    "it is reassuring to see completely diverse procedures lead to identical final result .",
    "however , following the establishment of equation , the author set to replace some appearances of the distances @xmath445 and @xmath436 in the equation with the distance @xmath446 ( in his notation ) .",
    "@xmath446 is the angular diameter distance from the source to the lens , it corresponds exactly to our @xmath390 in the appendix ; in principle it could be measured directly by an observer at the source or at the location of the lens .",
    "hence , @xmath446 is a measurable quantity , but the observer that can measure it must be located away from the assumed point of observation .",
    "thus , if all observations are assumed to be taken at a single point , as in the cosmological context , then the angular diameter distance @xmath446 must be determined indirectly , from other measurements .    in order to include @xmath446 in",
    ", the author used the relationship given by his equation ( 30 ) in @xcite , which is equivalent to our equation in the appendix .",
    "his final result is    ( eq .",
    "( 31 ) of @xcite , in original notation ) @xmath447 which in our notation , to first order in @xmath3 and @xmath391 , is @xmath448 solving the above for @xmath148 , we find , to first order in @xmath3 and @xmath391 , @xmath449 again , the above equation is in perfect agreement with our results , which can be seen by using equation ( a.13 ) to include @xmath390 in our cosmological lens equation .",
    "in fact , since our results are exact in @xmath0 , we see that if park were to work with any higher order terms of @xmath0 , he would have found that all these terms would be zero in his approximation as well .",
    "notice how @xmath0 gets thoroughly absorbed into the angular diameter distance @xmath390 .",
    "thus , only when expressing the lens equation entirely in terms of the angular diameter distances @xmath450 and @xmath451 does @xmath0 make an appearance ; an appearance that can be completely transformed away by using the angular diameter distance @xmath390 . clearly , given the relationship between @xmath390 , @xmath450 and @xmath451 ( equation ( a.13 ) ) , using only two of the three parameters is enough to express any result of interest .",
    "this raises the following question : which parameters should be used in expressing the cosmological lens equation ? or more specifically : should the parameter @xmath390 be used at all ? of the three parameters @xmath450 , @xmath451 and @xmath390 , only @xmath450 and @xmath451 are directly measurable at the assumed point of observation .",
    "and although @xmath390 can be found indirectly from other measurements that can be made at the point of observation , the value of @xmath390 can be established only with knowledge of @xmath0 ( as in equation ( a.13 ) , for example ) . with this in mind , we can address the above question by considering two possible cases in which the lens equation may be used .",
    "first , in a case where all the parameters of interest , such as the three @xmath450 , @xmath451 and @xmath390 , are available from some tabulated data or another source , one can use the lens equation in either form , with or without @xmath390 . in this case using @xmath390 in the cosmological lens equation is preferable , since it simplifies the expression .",
    "this will allow the predictions of images and masses by means of the lens equation , but will not allow studying the effects of @xmath0 on measurable quantities directly , which are completely absorbed in @xmath390 . then , although @xmath0 will not appear in the lens equation , if it is to be accounted for , its value must still be used at some point to establish the tabulated data , specifically the value of @xmath390 .",
    "thus , we see that the lack of appearance of @xmath0 in a relationship does not necessary imply its lack of influence on the phenomenon being studied .",
    "second , in a case where no pre - recorded parameters are available , it is clearly advantageous to use parameters that are measurable directly in the cosmological lens equation . therefore , in this case , equation ( or ) is preferable , in which @xmath0 appears explicitly and its influence on measurable quantities can be studied directly . in short",
    ", we see that @xmath0 has an effect on the cosmological lens equation in any case , and needs to be accounted for directly or indirectly .",
    "this should be kept in mind when choosing parameters in the expression of the cosmological lens equation and making any conclusions .",
    "then , using or not using the angular diameter distance @xmath390 in the final expression is really a matter of preference in a given situation .",
    "further , following his equation ( 31 ) in @xcite , the author states that  [ his ] result is in contradiction to the recent claims by @xcite which assert that there should be a @xmath452 correction to the conventional lensing analysis \" .",
    "this statement is somewhat inequitable , since in @xcite rindler and ishak never concern with the gravitational lens equation directly , and consider a setup that is quite different , for which they produce results applicable only to a static observer . later in his discussion",
    ", the author explains that the disagreement between his and rindler and ishak s results may be due to the following two problems :    1 .",
    "the setup in @xcite is not realistic , since they consider a static observer and neglect the relative comoving motion between the observer , source and lens .",
    "the relationships in @xcite are not expressed in terms of angular diameter distances , which is necessary for comparison with conventional results .",
    "he then explained that in their follow - up paper @xcite , they failed to address these problems properly , and suggested that it is possible to modify their existing results for an appropriate comparison .",
    "he pointed out that using relativistic aberration to modify their results can help resolve the first problem , but converting parameters to angular diameter distances could be tricky , which , as he explains , makes his approach favourable . in a paper published by ishak et .",
    "al . in 2010 ,",
    "@xcite , the authors argued that the apparent disagreement between the conclusions of @xcite and those of park can be due to the fact that park dropped terms of order @xmath453 from his final result , equation , which carry terms of @xmath0 .",
    "however , to properly compare the results of @xcite and @xcite we have used the method in @xcite to derive a lens equation subject to the same conditions as in @xcite , and found perfect agreement . more on it",
    "bellow , recall the end of section [ sec6a ] .",
    "much of the analysis of @xcite involves finding relationships between measurable and coordinate - like distances .",
    "we found that the methods presented in @xcite allow for converting a coordinate distance to the angular diameter distance measured by a static observer .",
    "this finding allowed for the derivation outlined at the end of section [ sec6a ] .",
    "equation is a cosmological lens equation , which we derived through rindler and ishak s methods and the standard aberration equation .",
    "it accounts for the effects of @xmath0 on the geometry and the relative comoving motion , induced by @xmath0 , between the observer , source and lens .",
    "the distance - like and angular quantities on the right side of equation , as well as on the right side of equation , are all measurable by a comoving observer .",
    "since equation agrees with our , which agrees with equation , we find perfect agreement between park s result and the one we ve obtained through rindler and ishak s methods . although the two methods are quite different , when done correctly they produce identical results .",
    "finally , let us re - emphasize that it should not be concluded from park s results that the influence of @xmath0 on the cosmological lens equation is of @xmath454 or higher .",
    "in fact , what park found , as we did as well , is that there is a term of @xmath455 in the lens equation , when considering a comoving observer .",
    "this is an important fact when comparing it to the lens equation for a static observer , for which we found through our methods , as well as rindler and ishak s methods , that the lowest order @xmath0 term that appears is @xmath456 .",
    "hence , given the investigations of our previous sections we were able to make a clear comparison between the results and conclusions in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this part we summarize and respond to the paper published by i. b. khriplovich and a. a. pomeransky in 2008 , titled  does the cosmological term influence gravitational lensing ? \" , @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper are often referred to in arguments against the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "the authors of this paper used both the kottler metric and the frw metric , equation ( 8) in @xcite , to investigate the appearance of @xmath0 in a given expression of interest . far away from the mass ,",
    "the kottler metric is well approximated by the de sitter metric , which is equivalent to the frw metric with a scale factor @xmath429 ( @xmath430 ) . by arriving at specific relationships through",
    "both the use of de sitter coordinates and frw coordinates separately , the authors compared the contribution of @xmath0 in the two different cases , and made conclusions based on this comparison .",
    "the authors begun their analysis by considering the invariant @xmath457 , where @xmath458 and @xmath459 are tangents of two intersecting null geodesics .",
    "they designate the positive root of this invariant by @xmath460 . in a local frame of some observer , it is trivial to show that for a small intersection angle between the light rays the invariant @xmath460 can be expressed ( up to a factor of @xmath461 ) as    ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) of @xcite , in original notation ) @xmath462 here , @xmath463 and @xmath12 are the energy of the photons and the intersection angle between them , respectively , that the observer measures .",
    "this equation can be easily obtained from the first order in angle approximation of our equation , keeping in mind equation , and its true for any observer as long as @xmath12 is small .",
    "it is assumed here that the two intersecting photons are of the same energy .",
    "note that the quantities appearing on the right hand side of the above equation are directly measurable , and their values are observer dependent , while the quantity on the left hand side of the equation is a constant for the particular intersecting trajectories . for different observers ,",
    "the measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath463 shift accordingly , so that their product always remains the same .",
    "the authors first considered the standard setup of gravitational lensing in kottler coordinates .",
    "see figure 1 in @xcite , which is similar to our figure [ lensing ] in the appendix .",
    "after approximating the solution to the orbital equation of light , far away from the mass , the authors express the measurable intersection angle , @xmath12 , between the bending trajectory and a purely radial trajectory , in these coordinates :    ( eq .",

    "we immediately recognize that the above relationship refers to a static observer in kottler ( or de sitter ) coordinates .",
    "this relationship is in perfect agreement with rindler and ishak s main result of @xcite , equation , and of course with our results of section [ sec5 ] .",
    "this equation is the most basic example of a relationship between a measurable angle and a euclidean angle that appears on a flat plane , on which a diagram of the setup is drawn .",
    "notice that the solution to the orbital equation is not necessary to form this particular relationship .",
    "it is also important to note that the main reason for this agreement between the results is due to the fact that the same static observer is involved in both approaches , which is unfortunately not specifically stated in neither @xcite nor @xcite . with the above expression for @xmath12",
    ", the authors proceeded to express the invariant @xmath460 as follows :    ( eq .",
    "( 7 ) of @xcite , in original notation ) @xmath469 here , the subscript of @xmath470 refers to the fact that the analysis is carried out with de sitter coordinates .",
    "it should be clear that given the fact that it is the static observer that is involved in the angle measurement , @xmath470 is the energy that is measured by a static observer as well .",
    "evidently , kottler ( or de sitter ) coordinates were employed in this paper merely in order to form relationships for a static observer in sds space ; to form the same relationships for a different observer the authors employed other coordinates , as we discuss below .",
    "it is not perfectly clear as to why the authors chose to use the euclidean angle @xmath465 in the expression for @xmath460 above , and what purpose this expression serves .",
    "since the energy @xmath463 has no obvious non - measurable counterpart , it is only @xmath12 that can be switched around with its euclidean counterpart , @xmath465 , in the expression for @xmath460 .",
    "as should be abundantly clear by now , a relationship between such measurable and euclidean angles should always involve @xmath0 when working in kottler ( or de sitter ) coordinates .",
    "thus , when a given expression involves one of the angles @xmath12 or @xmath465 , but does not involve @xmath0 , by replacing the angle involved with its counterpart @xmath0 is forced into the expression . the reason for choosing one angle over the other as a parameter in a given expression should always be clarified before drawing any conclusion from the expression .",
    "it is often advantageous to express some relationship with purely measurable parameters or , conversely , with purely euclidean ( or coordinate - like ) parameters .",
    "the expression for @xmath460 above mixes measurable and euclidean parameters with no satisfactory reason .",
    "next , the authors proceeded their investigation by employing frw coordinates to produce an expression for the invariant @xmath460 with reference to a comoving observer . far away from the mass ,",
    "the kottler metric is well approximated by the de sitter metric , which is equivalent to the frw metric with the scale factor @xmath471 ( in the notation of @xcite ) .",
    "see equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) in @xcite . in that region of space , a comoving observer is simply an observer with constant frw spatial coordinates , and it is in this way , as recognized by the authors of @xcite , it is easy to produce results for this observer by using the frw metric . through the use of this metric",
    "the authors find :    ( eq .",
    "( 16 ) of @xcite , in original notation ) @xmath472 here , the subscript of @xmath473 refers to the fact that the analysis is carried out with frw coordinates .",
    "the authors argue that these coordinates are the most appropriate for the description of observations , but given the tools of our section [ sec5 ] , we recognize that these coordinates are simply convenient to use when dealing with comoving observers .",
    "identical results can be obtained with any equivalent metric as long as the observer is the same , and its 4-velocity is transformed appropriately and accounted for in the derivation .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 in the above equation is not the same @xmath58 that was used in the previous sections .",
    "this @xmath58 is the constant frw coordinate distance between the comoving observer and the lens , while the distance of closest approach to the lens , with reference to areal radius coordinate , is represented by @xmath18 .",
    "( in the frw sense , @xmath18 is the distance , which is the coordinate separation multiplied by the scale factor , at the time of closest approach of the photon to the lens . )",
    "the proper interpretation of @xmath18 in this context deserves further attention , but we shall not digress into it here . since @xmath473 is the measurable energy by a comoving observer , the quantity @xmath474 in equals the intersection angle that is measurable by this observer as well . as before ,",
    "the choice of parameters in the above expression for @xmath460 as well as its purpose are not perfectly clear , and we see a mix between measurable and non - measurable quantities .",
    "note that to arrive at the above equation one simply needs to express the measurable intersection angle , @xmath12 , appearing in as @xmath474 , which can be easily done by drawing the diagram of the lensing setup with reference to frw coordinates .",
    "in fact , the solution to the orbital equation is not needed to find the required expression . and",
    "finally , although @xmath0 does not explicitly appear in the above expression for @xmath460 , it does not tell us anything about its influence on measurements of angles or about its possible appearance in other relationships of interest .",
    "this absence of @xmath0 in the above expression , in contrast to its appearance in equation , seems to be wrongfully interpreted throughout the literature .",
    "it is clear that with our general formula for the measurable angle , equation , we can easily produce results by using any coordinates for any observer .",
    "it saves the trouble of transforming to a specific coordinate system merely to consider the measurement of a specific observer , as was done by the authors of @xcite and @xcite , for example .",
    "although the authors of @xcite did consider measurements by both static and comoving observers , neither the bending angle in sds space nor the lens equation were specifically addressed . and while they also touched up on the actual trajectory of light , see equations ( 3 - 5 ) and ( 18 ) in @xcite , which led them to define the parameter @xmath18 , they did not really need these relationships to establish their ultimate results , equations and .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath463 in are directly measurable and local , and as long as the intersection angle at the point of observation is small , the rest of the trajectories does not matter .",
    "clearly , it also does not matter what metric one chooses to work with if the metrics are equivalent .",
    "the authors of @xcite decided to use the frw metric , far away from the mass , merely to consider measurements made by a comoving observer . in this sense , in the cosmological context , these coordinates are the ones that are more appropriate to describe measurements , as they claim",
    ". however , let us re - emphasize that from the results of @xcite it can not be concluded that @xmath0 has no effect on gravitational lensing ; more specifically , it is incorrect to reason that the results of @xcite imply the non - contribution of @xmath0 to the cosmological lens equation .",
    "in a universe with a cosmological constant , the space outside a spherically symmetric non - rotating mass is well described by the kottler metric . with the recent increasing interest in the cosmological constant ,",
    "sds spacetime became a popular background for investigating the various effects of gravity .",
    "a natural way to study the effects of @xmath0 is to revisit the classical tests of general relativity .",
    "one of the most popular predicted phenomena associated with such tests is the deflection of light by a massive object .",
    "it was a long time ago that the question of whether or not @xmath0 plays a roll in this phenomenon has been asked , but unfortunately until this day this topic seems to be suffering from misconceptions and disagreements .",
    "we see that the answer to the above question is not simply in the positive or negative , but is very sensitive to the particular situation that is being considered . in the course of the ongoing investigation it became clear that in order to properly address the above question one must consider both the geometry of the underlying space and the act of observation by a given observer , on top of the orbital equation for a light ray and its solution .",
    "it is mainly due to the work of islam , @xcite , that it was generally agreed upon that @xmath0 has no affect on the orbit of a light ray , as acknowledged by rindler and ishak in @xcite . and",
    "it is due to the findings of rindler and ishak in @xcite that it was realized by many that real measurements must be considered as well in investigating the contribution of @xmath0 . given that the previous investigations and conclusions by islam in @xcite and rindler and ishak in @xcite are correct , what we have done in the present work is address the following question : in what way do results and expressions of interest depend on which observer is making the measurement ?",
    "in other words , since according to islam the path of light is not affected by @xmath0 , and according to rindler and ishak the measurement of an angle is affected by @xmath0 , the circumstances naturally leads to the question above .",
    "investigating this question in detail led us to the results of section [ sec5 ] , the most important of which are not found in the literature and are fundamental to the topic at hand .",
    "we have begun our investigation from fundamental considerations , and revisited the original issue of whether or not @xmath0 affects the path of a light ray itself in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "it was found that the dependence of a path on @xmath0 was entirely involved in the boundary conditions that are being used in a given situation . evidently , whether or not @xmath0 enters the orbital differential equation does not matter , due to the particular way in which its appearance can be entirely absorbed into a new parameter . specifically , even if the orbital equation is written in terms of a parameter ( such as @xmath57 ) that brings in a term of @xmath0 with it , this term of @xmath0 will vanish from the solution completely when certain boundary conditions are enforced .",
    "such boundary conditions are purely euclidean , or rather coordinate related , which are the most popular in the literature and most appropriate in common situations ; for such boundary conditions varying the value of @xmath0 would not affect the set of points through which the light passes . for this reason",
    ", we recognized that it is acceptable to conclude , but with caution , that @xmath0 does not affect the path of light and best not be used in the orbital equation .",
    "however , it is also important to understand that when considering directly measurable quantities as boundary conditions , @xmath0 usually enters the equation describing the path .",
    "in addition , of course , in situations where the boundary conditions themselves depend on @xmath0 directly , @xmath0 will also appear in the equation describing the path .",
    "an important lesson here is that the contribution of @xmath0 to results of interest depends closely on the situation being analyzed , and any general conclusions should be drawn carefully .",
    "our investigations illuminate many possible sources of confusion and misinterpretation regarding this issue , which unfortunately seem to have had a great affect on recent literature .",
    "let us re - emphasise that perhaps the most important result of this work is equation .",
    "it opens up a way to a more general analysis and is essential to properly investigate the effects of @xmath0 on measurable angles .",
    "in addition , it allows for an elegant approach to many situations when analyzing gravitational lensing , and yields an invariant general relativistic aberration equation .",
    "it is interesting to note that in some recent papers , such as @xcite and @xcite , the authors used a transformation of coordinates in order to be able to find a measurable angle by a given observer .",
    "it seems that trying to express a measurable angle by an arbitrary observer in an analytic , and coordinate independent , way is generally avoided in the literature .",
    "often , the coordinate transformations that make it easy to express a given measurable angle abandon the use of spherical symmetry and complicate the overall analysis considerably , see @xcite .",
    "this undesirable consequence and other complications that a coordinate transformation may bring can be easily avoided by working with the general formula ; it can be put to use in any coordinate system and produce results related to any observer of interest .",
    "more on this in @xcite , where we demonstrate the latter point in the context of weak gravitational lensing , and compare results obtained by means of equation to results obtained by means of a coordinate transformation ( as was done in @xcite , for example ) .",
    "in addition to the papers discussed in section [ sec6 ] , there are other papers on the topic that are worth looking at , including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and some references therein .",
    "although our responses to some of these papers are not included in the present report , the material we presented here is useful in understanding and interpreting their results , and it is of fundamental importance for making proper comparison of the different conclusions the authors arrive to .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that when studying the effects of @xmath0 , approximations on @xmath0 should be avoided or made with care . due to the sensitive way in which @xmath0 vanishes from exact results , within a given approximation",
    "@xmath0 may end up appearing in relationships where it does not belong .",
    "and although such an approximation might be justified , due to the smallness of @xmath0 or some other parameter , and may be numerically accurate , this appearance of @xmath0 in resulting relationships may be theoretically misleading ; see @xcite and our section [ sec6b ] .    finally , we hope that the material presented in this work will provide a proper perspective when addressing questions regarding the influence of @xmath0 , and that it will aide in gaining a clear understanding of , and ultimately settling , the recent debate on the topic .",
    "the relationships that are stated below are derived in @xcite , where we turn attention to the role of @xmath0 in cosmological distance measurements and the gravitational lens equation .",
    "the following figure is referred to in the definitions and the relationships below .",
    "the relationships listed below refer to the setup of figure [ lensing ] .",
    "all of the parameters used are defined above .",

    "<S> we present a general technique which allows finding measurable intersection angles of null trajectories analytically , and as one of its applications we establish a general relativistic aberration relationship . the tools presented are used to analyze some standard setups of gravitational deflection of light and gain a clear understanding of the role that the cosmological constant , @xmath0 , plays in gravitational lensing phenomena . through reviewing some recent papers on the topic with the present results in mind , we attempt to explain the major sources of disagreement in the ongoing debate on the subject , which started with rindler and ishak s original paper , regarding the influence of @xmath0 on lensing phenomena . to avoid ambiguities and room for misunderstanding we present clear definitions of the quantities used in the present analysis as well as in other papers we discuss . </S>"
