    "at zero temperature , fluctuations of the quantum electromagnetic field in vacuum manifest themselves via an attraction of two parallel ideal - conductor plates . this casimir effect ( for an introduction see @xcite )",
    "has a universal character in the sense that it does not depend on the material constitution of the metallic plates .",
    "casimir s result was extended to arbitrary temperatures and general dielectric plates @xcite , and to ideal - conductor walls of arbitrary smooth shapes @xcite .",
    "for a recent book and review see @xcite .",
    "the studied models can be divided according to the geometry of fluctuating walls into two basic sets : the semi - infinite systems , in which at least one of the spatial coordinates is unconstrained by the walls ( e.g. two parallel plates ) , and the fully - finite systems ( e.g. a sphere ) .",
    "the applied methods and observed casimir phenomena usually depend on this classification .    as",
    "concerns semi - infinite geometries , in the high - temperature limit defined by the validity of the equipartitioning energy law , the casimir force becomes purely entropic @xcite ; this force is usually called classical since it does not depend on planck s constant . in the purely electrostatic models which do not incorporate the magnetic part of the lorentz force due to charge currents , like the system of scalar photons @xcite ,",
    "the casimir force is divided by a factor 2 .    as concerns fully - finite three - dimensional ( 3d ) conductor systems @xcite , in the high - temperature limit",
    ", the casimir free energy does depend on planck s constant .",
    "furthermore , the presence of both electric and magnetic degrees of freedom is necessary for obtaining a casimir effect .",
    "this is no longer true for classical 2d coulomb fluids defined in fully - finite domains .",
    "there , the consideration of the pure coulomb potential , defined as the solution of the 2d poisson equation , leads to a universal casimir term analogous to the one appearing in finite - size expansions of thermodynamic quantities for 2d critical systems with _ short - range _ interactions among constituents . to be more precise ,",
    "it is known that , according to the principle of conformal invariance , for a finite system of characteristic size @xmath0 , at a critical point , the ( dimensionless ) free energy has a large-@xmath0 expansion of the form @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the inverse temperature .",
    "the coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the bulk and surface parts are non - universal .",
    "the coefficient of the logarithmic casimir term is universal , dependent only on the conformal anomaly number @xmath5 of the critical theory and on the euler number @xmath6 of the manifold on which the system is confined . in general ,",
    "@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of handles and @xmath9 the number of boundaries of the manifold ( @xmath10 for the surface of a sphere , @xmath11 for a disc , @xmath12 for an annulus or a torus ) .",
    "a simple example is the gaussian model @xcite which is critical at all temperatures , with the conformal anomaly number @xmath13 . at any temperature of the conducting regime",
    ", the grand potential of a classical 2d coulomb system of characteristic size @xmath0 is supposed to exhibit a large-@xmath0 expansion of type ( [ 1.1 ] ) , with however a + sign in front of the logarithmic term : @xmath14 plausible arguments for a critical - like behaviour were first given for coulomb gases with periodic boundary conditions @xcite , then for coulomb systems confined to a domain by ( vacuum ) plain hard walls @xcite , by inert ideal - conductor walls ( i.e. when the electric potential obeys dirichlet boundary conditions ) @xcite and finally by ideal - dielectric boundaries ( i.e. when the electric potential obeys neumann boundary conditions ) @xcite .",
    "the explicit checks were done in the debye - hckel limit @xcite , at the free - fermion point of the thirring representation of the symmetric two - component plasma , based on the formalism developed in @xcite , and for the one - component plasma at @xmath15 in a disc @xcite . only recently ,",
    "a direct derivation of the universal finite - size correction term was done , in the whole stability range of temperatures , for the specific cases of the symmetric two - component plasma living on the surface of a sphere @xcite and in a disc surrounded by vacuum @xcite . in both cases , the universal prefactor to the @xmath16 correction term in ( [ 1.2 ] )",
    "was related to the bulk second moment of the density structure factor which is known @xcite .",
    "this is very different from the semi - infinite geometries where the universality of the casimir force is related to the second moment sum rule for the _ charge _ structure factor @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that , for semi - infinite systems , the presence of an electrolyte between fluctuating conductor walls screens the long - ranged casimir force to some residual short - ranged force @xcite .",
    "the study of casimir phenomena via fully microscopic coulomb models has the advantage of a coherent description of electrostatic fluctuations inside conducting walls and the image forces acting on the electrolyte particles , without any ad hoc separation ansatz used in usual macroscopic treatments @xcite .",
    "we used this strategy to show the screening effect of casimir forces for semi - infinite geometries in paper @xcite , in what follows referred to as i.    the aim of the present work is to extend the study of the screening ( cancellation ) phenomena to universal casimir terms appearing in the large - size expansions of the grand potential ( [ 1.2 ] ) for the coulomb systems confined in fully - finite 2d geometries , in particular the disc geometry .",
    "the confining disc walls as well as the electrolyte inside the disc are modelled by two different microscopic two - component plasmas of point - like particles with @xmath17 unit charges in thermal equilibrium .",
    "two cases are solved exactly : the high - temperature ( debye - hckel ) limit @xmath18 and the thirring free - fermion point @xmath15 corresponding to the collapse of positive and negative pairs of point - like charges . from the technical point of view , the circular symmetry of the problem leads to infinite summations over specific products of modified bessel functions which have to be evaluated by using the asymptotic debye expansion ; we apply a few technicalities which help us to simplify a relatively complicated algebra .",
    "similarities and differences with respect to screening phenomena in semi - infinite geometries , described in paper i , are pointed out .",
    "the model is defined as follows .",
    "we shall consider coulomb - gas systems of point - like particles with symmetric @xmath17 unit charges .",
    "thermal equilibrium is treated in the grand canonical ensemble characterized by the inverse temperature @xmath2 and by the couple of equivalent ( there is no external electrostatic potential ) , possibly position - dependent , particle fugacities @xmath19 . in the disc geometry presented in figure 1 , there are two domains : the disc of radius @xmath0 , @xmath20 , and its complement @xmath21 .",

    "the coulomb potential @xmath30 at a spatial position @xmath31 , induced by a unit charge at the origin @xmath32 , is the solution of the 2d poisson equation @xmath33 explicitly , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a free length scale , which only determines the zero of the potential and should not enter statistical mean values .",
    "the interaction energy of charged particles @xmath36 , immersed in a homogeneous medium of dielectric constant = 1 , is @xmath37 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in general section 2 ,",
    "the coulomb gas confined to some 2d regions is shown to be equivalent , in the ideal - conductor limit , to the massless gaussian model defined in the complementary empty regions . since in the derivation @xcite of the large - size expansion of the free energy ( [ 1.1 ] ) for the critical gaussian model with @xmath13 only the curvature of the boundary is used , this explains the difference in sign of the logarithmic term between ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) .    in section 3 , the underlying 2d fully - finite coulomb system is solved in the debye - hckel limit .",
    "all possible realizations of the model are considered , and the cancellation of the universal casimir terms is documented when both the disc domain and its complement are occupied by a coulomb gas .",
    "fundamental differences between fully - finite and semi - infinite geometries are pointed out .",
    "the exact solution of the model system at the thirring free - fermion point @xmath15 is presented in section 4 .",
    "it is shown that basic features of casimir phenomena , predicted by the mean - field theory , persist also at this specific temperature .",
    "a brief recapitulation is given in section 5 .",
    "the universal term @xmath38 in the grand potential ( [ 1.2 ] ) of a finite 2d coulomb system closely resembles the logarithmic term in ( [ 1.1 ] ) valid for critical systems . at first sight , it is surprising that a coulomb system , with short - range particle correlations , exhibits a critical - like behaviour .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that this is related to the existence of long - ranged critical - like correlations of the electric potential ; reasons for the difference in sign of the logarithmic term between ( [ 1.1 ] ) and ( [ 1.2 ] ) have been given .",
    "a slightly different , and we believe more convincing , argument will now be presented .      in the present subsection ,",
    "we consider a 2d manifold on which some regions @xmath39 are classical ideal conductors and some regions @xmath40 are empty .",
    "the ideal conductors are obtained as the infinite fugacity limit of conductors having some microscopic structure , which amounts to take the limit in which the microscopic length scale goes to zero .",
    "thus , the results which will be obtained in this limit are expected to be valid when the length scales under consideration are much larger than the microscopic lengths . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to an infinite - plane manifold , @xmath41 , and start with conductors which are symmetric coulomb gases of the kind described in the introduction , but some generalizations are straightforward .    the interaction energy @xmath42 of @xmath43 charged particles @xmath44 is expressible in terms of the microscopic charge density @xmath45 as follows @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the ( diverging ) self - energy .",

    "can be transformed via the integration by parts into @xmath67 .",
    "the sine - gordon action ( [ 2.4b ] ) thus takes its minimum at a @xmath58 constant in space . due to a discrete symmetry @xmath68 with any integer @xmath69 ,",
