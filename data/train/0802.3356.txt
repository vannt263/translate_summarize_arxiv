    "a purely intuitive conjecture is that the it integral itself may appear as a stochastic correction term in a change of variable formula when the underlying stochastic process has fourth order scaling properties .",
    "the first formula of this type was proven in @xcite ; however , the `` fourth order scaling '' process considered in that paper was a highly abstract object with little intuitive appeal .",
    "the present article presents a change of variable formula with it correction term for a family of processes with fourth order local scaling properties ; see ( [ newito ] ) and corollary [ c : main ] .    the process which is our primary focus is the solution , @xmath0 , to the stochastic heat equation @xmath6 with initial conditions @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a space  time white noise on @xmath9 .",
    "that is , @xmath10 } p(x - y , t - r)w(dy\\times dr),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the heat kernel .",
    "let @xmath2 , where @xmath12 is fixed . in the prequel to this paper @xcite , it was shown that @xmath3 is a continuous , centered gaussian process with covariance function @xmath13 and that @xmath3 has a nontrivial quartic variation .",
    "in particular , @xmath14 in @xmath15 .",
    "it follows that @xmath3 is not a semimartingale , so a stochastic integral with respect to @xmath3 can not be defined in the classical it sense . in this paper , we complete the construction of a stochastic integral with respect to @xmath3 which is a limit of discrete riemann sums .",
    "more generally , we shall construct a stochastic integral with respect to any process @xmath16 of the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a continuous stochastic process , independent of @xmath3 , satisfying @xmath20 this allows us , for example , to consider solutions to ( [ spde ] ) with nonzero initial conditions .",
    "another example of such an @xmath16 is fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath21 ; see examples [ ex:1 ] and [ ex:2 ] for more details .",
    "note that @xmath22 ( and therefore @xmath16 ) need not be a gaussian process .",
    "if it is gaussian , however , its mean function will be @xmath23 and its covariance function will be @xmath24 .",
    "conversely , the results in this paper will apply to any gaussian process @xmath16 whose mean and covariance have the respective forms @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the mean and covariance , respectively , of a gaussian process satisfying ( [ exten0 ] ) .",
    "we conjecture that the results in this paper hold when @xmath22 is only required to be of bounded variation .",
    "we require @xmath22 to be @xmath29 , however , because of our particular method of proof ; see the proofs of corollaries 4.6 and 6.4 for further details .    for simplicity , we consider only evenly spaced partitions .",
    "that is , given a positive integer @xmath30 , let @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    ", we consider the midpoint - style riemann sums @xmath36 when @xmath37 , we will simply write @xmath38 , rather than @xmath39 .    in the construction of the classical it integral , the quadratic variation of the integrator plays a crucial role .",
    "although the quadratic variation of @xmath16 is infinite , the `` alternating quadratic variation '' of @xmath16 is finite .",
    "that is , @xmath40 converges in law .",
    "if we denote the limit process by @xmath41 , then it is a simple corollary of the main result in @xcite that @xmath41 is a brownian motion which is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "more specifically , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a standard brownian motion , independent of @xmath16 , and @xmath44 [ see ( [ kap ] ) for the precise definition of @xmath45 .",
    "the convergence here is in law in the skorokhod space of cadlag functions from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "we shall show that @xmath49 also converges in law . if @xmath50 denotes a process with this limiting law , then our main result",
    "( corollary [ c : main ] ) is the following change of variable formula : @xmath51 where the equality is in law as processes .",

    "to state our results more completely , let @xmath53 be a semimartingale and define @xmath54\\\\[-8pt ] & & { } - \\frac{\\kappa}2\\int_0^t \\partial_x^2 g(x(s),s ) \\,dy(s).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we show that @xmath55 in law in @xmath56 whenever @xmath57 .",
    "[ see ( [ c1k0])([c1k3 ] ) for the precise definition of the space @xmath58 . also see remarks [ r : main1 ] and [ r : main2 ] . ]    the benefit of having the convergence of this triple , rather than just the riemann sums , can be seen if one considers two separate sequences of sums : @xmath59 and @xmath60 . as @xmath61 , these sequences will converge jointly in law . separately",
    ", each limit will satisfy ( [ newito ] ) ; moreover , the brownian motions which appear in the two limits will be identical . in this sense , the brownian motion in ( [ newito ] ) depends only on @xmath3 and not on @xmath22 , @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "clearly , this can be extended to any finite collection of sequences of riemann sums .    in the course of our analysis",
    ", we will also obtain the asymptotic behavior of the trapezoid - style sum @xmath64 we shall see ( corollary [ c : expan3 ] ) that @xmath65 uniformly on compacts in probability ( ucp ) whenever @xmath66 .",
    "this result remains true even when @xmath17 , where @xmath22 satisfies only ( [ exten0 ] ) , and is not necessarily independent of @xmath3 .",
    "it is instructive to contrast these results with those of russo , vallois and coauthors @xcite , who , in the context of fractional brownian motion , use a regularization procedure to transform these riemann sums into integrals before passing to the limit ; see also @xcite .",
    "for instance , if @xmath63 does not depend on @xmath67 , then the regularized midpoint sum is @xmath68 and the regularized trapezoid sum is @xmath69 using a change of variables , we can see that if @xmath70 is locally integrable , then the difference between these two integrals goes to zero almost surely as @xmath71 . hence , under the regularization procedure , the midpoint and trapezoid sums exhibit the same limiting behavior : they converge ucp to integrals satisfying the classical change of variable formula from ordinary calculus . under the discrete approach which we are following , however , we see new behavior for the midpoint sum : the emergence of a correction term which is a classical it integral against an independent brownian motion .    it should be noted that all of our convergence results rely on the fact that @xmath3 is a quartic variation process . that is , @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "for example , the convergence of @xmath74 to a brownian motion is made plausible by the fact that it is a sum of terms of the form @xmath75 , each of which is approximately mean zero with an approximate variance of @xmath76 .",
    "if we replace @xmath3 by a rougher process which satisfies ( [ order ] ) for some @xmath77 , then the midpoint sums will evidently diverge . on the other hand ,",
    "the ucp convergence of the trapezoid sums @xmath78 remains plausible for any @xmath79 .",
    "this is consistent with the analogous results in @xcite for regularized sums .",
    "the critical case for the trapezoid sum is @xmath80 . at the time of writing , we know of only one result in this case .",
    "if @xmath81 , then @xmath82 [ here , and in what follows , @xmath83 shall mean that @xmath84 ucp . ]",
    "if @xmath3 is replaced by fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath80 , then this last sum converges in law to a brownian motion ; see @xcite , for example .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that a result analogous to ( [ newito ] ) also holds in this case .",
    "our project is related to , and inspired by , several areas of stochastic analysis .",
    "recently , a new approach to integration was developed by t. lyons ( with coauthors , students and other researchers ) .",
    "the new method is known as `` rough paths '' ; an introduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "our approach is much more elementary since it is based on a form of riemann sums .",
    "we consider it of interest to see how far the classical methods can be pushed and what they can yield .",
    "the it - type correction term in our change of variable formula has a certain elegance to it , and a certain logic , if we recall that our underlying process has quartic variation .",
    "finally , our project can be considered a toy model for some numerical schemes .",
    "the fact that the correction term in the change of variable formula involves an independent brownian motion may give some information about the form and size of errors in numerical schemes .",
    "after the first draft of this paper had been finished , we received a preprint @xcite from nourdin and rveillac , prepared independently of ours and using different methods . that paper contains a number of results , one of which , theorem 1.2 , is a special case of our corollary [ c : main ] .",
    "namely , if @xmath85 ( fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath86 ) , if @xmath63 does not depend on @xmath67 and if @xmath63 satisfies an additional moment condition ( see @xmath87 in section 3 of @xcite ) , then @xcite gives the convergence in distribution of the scalar - valued random variables @xmath88 .",
    "while @xcite is devoted exclusively to fractional brownian motion , it is mentioned in a footnote that a girsanov - type transformation can be used to extend the results from @xmath89 to @xmath3 .",
    "here , and in the remainder of this paper , @xmath90  shall denote a constant whose value may change from line to line .    let @xmath91 denote the space of cadlag functions from @xmath92 to @xmath93 endowed with the skorokhod topology .",
