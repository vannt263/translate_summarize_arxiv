    "any base pair step fluctuates in a thermal environment . in general the thermal mean value as well as the covariance matrix",
    "are sequence  dependent . in order to study the large scale behavior of a random sequence chain",
    ", we include this variability as another , independent source of randomness in addition to the thermal fluctuations @xcite .",
    "i.e.  we consider a random sequence step @xmath55 $ ] which fluctuates around a global , sequence  independent equilibrium conformation @xmath18 , with a covariance matrix @xmath56 resulting from both sequence and thermal fluctuations .",

    "the associated thermal covariance matrix is @xmath65 on the other hand , the covariance of the sequence ",
    "dependent thermal mean values is given by @xmath66 where the outermost expectation is effectively taken with respect to the step sequence distribution @xmath67 .",
    "since the two sources of randomness are independent , their covariances add up .",
    "one computes @xmath68 given the covariance ( or stiffness ) matrices and equilibrium values of all sixteen dinucleotide steps , and a distribution of relative step frequencies @xmath67 , by computing @xmath18 and @xmath60 we have characterized a thermally fluctuating random sequence step in terms of its center and second moment .",
    "up to this point , step deformations and therefore also the covariance matrices were given with respect to a reference frame fixed to the equilibrium base  pair frame @xmath18 , which in general is offset and tilted relative to its own local helical axis .",
    "to relate the rbc deformations to a coarse  grained wlc model , we are much more interested in the elastic properties of the _ centerline _ of the chain .",
    "such a centerline can be taken as the local helical axis for every base pair step , cf .",
    "[ fig : screw ] .",
    "this has the disadvantage that for fluctuating steps , the centerline pieces do not form a continuous curve . on the other hand , one can fit a continuous centerline globally to a stretch of a rbc @xcite .",
    "in such an approach , the centerline depends non - locally on the base pair step conformations , introducing artificial correlations on the length scale over which the fitting procedure extends .",
    "we circumvent these problems in three steps .",
    "first we transform all rigid base  pairs of the chain to new frames of reference .",
    "these are chosen such that _ without fluctuations _ , all new bp frames lie exactly on , and point in the direction of a single straight helical axis .",
    "we can then identify and average over the unwanted shear degrees of freedom . in a last step , this reduced model is averaged over the helical phase angle and mapped to the wlc models .",
    "we would like to transform small deviations from an equilibrium conformation @xmath18 into small deviations from a version of @xmath18 which is on - axis .",
    "consider first a regular helix composed of identical @xmath18 steps .",

    "since @xmath70 is a transformation between on - axis frames , its rotation and displacement vectors point along the @xmath11 axis , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    for a _ fluctuating _ rbc we calculate , @xmath73g{\\ensuremath{_\\mathit{ax}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath74 $ ] is the off - axis fluctuating step .",

    "explicitly , if @xmath79 , one finds @xmath80 written in @xmath2 blocks . pulling a similarity transformation inside the exponential series we can then rewrite as @xmath81g{\\ensuremath{_\\mathit{ax}}}= g_{0{\\shortparallel}}\\exp[\\xi_{\\shortparallel}^ix_i ] \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here",
    "the deviation from the on - axis equilibrium step @xmath82 , has zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath83    the rbc composed of steps is an equivalent description of the original chain , which we may call its on - axis version .",
    "intuitively , to each fluctuating frame @xmath14 of the original chain , we rigidly connected a frame @xmath84 in such a way that the primed , on - axis chain fluctuates about a straight , but still twisted , equilibrium conformation .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : combview ] . the sequence ",
    "dependent equilibrium conformations produce an irregular helix .",
    "thermal fluctuations increase irregularity .",
    "however , when averaging over thermal and sequence fluctuations , the on - axis configuration is exactly lined up on a straight helical axis . note",
    "that we had no need to compute a fluctuating axis explicitly .",
    "the on - axis rbc has the nice property that the translational fluctuations @xmath85 are now exactly transversal to the equilibrium helix axis .",
    "they are pure shear modes and do not contribute to compression fluctuations along the chain .",
    "let @xmath86 be the vector of the four remaining variables .",
    "noting that the volume element @xmath59 depends only the angular part ( see appendix [ sec : volel ] ) , we write @xmath87 from which one can see that the @xmath7 covariance matrix @xmath88 is the same as @xmath89 with its @xmath90 rows and columns deleted .",
    "thus , @xmath91 has a centered distribution with covariance matrix @xmath92 .",
    "here and in the following , @xmath93 indicates deletion of the shear rows and columns in an on - axis , @xmath75 matrix .",
    "e.g ,  @xmath94 is the @xmath7 adjoint matrix .",
    "also unless noted otherwise , we consider only on - axis quantities and suppress the @xmath95 subscript in the following .",
    "while we assume thermal fluctuations of neighboring steps to be independent random variables , there are nevertheless correlations in the _ sequence identity _ of neighboring base - pair steps .",
    "any realization of a random sequence of dinucleotide steps must be ` continuous ' , e.g.  @xmath96 implies that @xmath97 can only start with a g. these correlations need to be taken into account when calculating expectation values for random sequences of dna .",
    "for this purpose , we now consider the combined fluctuations of a short rbc consisting of @xmath98 base pair steps .    assuming independent , identically distributed bases we obtain the joint pdf of sequence steps along the chain as the product of the base pdfs , @xmath99 .",
    "this implies that the covariance between thermal mean values , @xmath100 here we introduced a nearest  neighbor term @xmath101 which will be computed below .",
    "no nearest ",
    "neighbor correlation occurs in the thermal covariances by assumption .",
    "we are now in a position to combine the @xmath98 base pair steps of our chain into one compound step . here",
    ", @xmath98 must be small enough that the typical deviation angles of the compound step from equilibrium stay small .",
    "i.e , the short chain must be well approximated by a ( helical ) rigid rod .",

    "@xmath107    one sees that the @xmath108 components are successively rotated around the @xmath11 axis , while the @xmath109 components are unaffected .",
    "what is the covariance matrix @xmath110 of the compound deviation ? using , we are left with a sum of appropriately transformed single ",
    "step covariances @xmath111 and in addition a sum of nearest neighbor cross  terms involving @xmath101 : @xmath112 the cross ",
    "covariance @xmath113 represents the fact that nearest neighbor equilibrium steps are correlated and their frames of reference are rotated by an angle @xmath114 .",

    "have the recursion relation @xmath115 the same relation is obeyed by a sequence of _ independent _ steps with covariance matrix @xmath116 . we conclude that except for a boundary term @xmath113 at the beginning of the chain , a rbc with independent steps and with covariances @xmath117 exhibits the same effective covariance as the original , short range correlated chain with @xmath92 and @xmath113 .",
    "the relative error in effective compound covariance is of order @xmath118 .",
    "a shear  averaged , on - axis rbc still has a finite equilibrium twist and anisotropic bending stiffness . to relate it to a wlc with isotropic bending rigidity , we perform an average over a continuous helical phase angle rotation of the reference frame @xcite .",
    "an on - axis covariance matrix which is rotated by a helical phase angle @xmath119 around the average local helical axis ( see ) , is @xmath120 where @xmath121 $ ] is a pure rotation by an angle @xmath119 around @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath122 has the form , the helical phase average is seen to be @xmath123 from @xmath124 one can read off the bend and twist persistence lengths as @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively , where the on - axis helical rise is @xmath127 .",
    "the wlc stiffness matrix @xmath128 can be found by inversion and has the same block structure , see also appendix [ sec : volel ] .",
    "its nonzero components are the bend , twist , stretch and twist  stretch coupling stiffness coefficients .",
    "we have derived all wlc elastic parameters starting from an arbitrarily oriented and offset rbc .",
    "we now discuss in some detail how these coarse  grained parameters are related to the microscopic rbc parameters .",
    "the transformation of the equilibrium step onto the helical axis leaves the total rotation angle invariant .",
    "therefore the equilibrium twist of @xmath70 is @xmath129 .",
    "i.e , the twist per base pair of the wlc equals the total angle of rotation , not the tw angle of the off - axis step .",
    "the equilibrium rise on axis is @xmath130 which is different from both off - axis quantities @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "these differences are of order @xmath133 so they become important only when the equilibrium rotation axis @xmath134 has significant roll and tilt with respect to the material frame , i.e.  when the local helical parameters inclination and tip @xcite are not negligible .      unlike the equilibrium step , the covariance matrix is changed not only by the rotation @xmath51 but also by the shift @xmath50 onto the average local helix axis .",
    "intuitively , the on - axis frame @xmath40 is rigidly connected to @xmath19 , cf .",
    "[ fig : screw ] , [ fig : combview ] .",
    "therefore , a rotational fluctuation of @xmath19 with rotation vector @xmath135 will result in an additional _ translational _ fluctuations of @xmath40 equal to @xmath136 .",
    "a familiar example of this geometrical effect is the stretching of an ordinary coil spring along its helix axis . in the wire material",
    ", this deformation corresponds mainly to torsion , i.e.  a rotational deformation of consecutive wire segments . on a larger scale , this deformation is levered into a translation of one coil end along the helix axis .",
    "the transformation captures exactly this lever arm effect , which is proportional to the total axial displacement @xmath137 and so becomes relevant if the chain deviates from an idealized b - dna form .",
    "we calculate explicitly the @xmath2 blocks @xmath138 of @xmath89 , , in terms of the corresponding blocks @xmath139 of @xmath60 , using and . here",

    "in contrast , the translational block @xmath146 and the coupling block @xmath147 have ` leverage terms ' , since rotational fluctuations about directions perpendicular to the offset vector contribute through a cross product with @xmath50 .",

    "the coupling block @xmath147 has contributions from @xmath145 in first order .",
    "these leverage terms persist in the reduced wlc covariance matrix @xmath117 .",
    "they are the remainder of the microscopic description of fluctuations with respect to a material frame that is offset from the average helical axis .",
    "consider for example a base pair step that exhibits @xmath1-displacement but no inclination or tip , i.e.  @xmath149 .",
    "then implies that any coupled roll  rise ( @xmath150 ) and roll ( @xmath151 ) fluctuations will add to the stretching fluctuations @xmath152 of the chain .",

    "as a result of the coarse  graining procedure outlined above , we obtain a set of wlc parameters from a set of sequence  dependent rbc stiffness ( or covariance ) matrices and equilibrium offsets .",
    "there are several different parameter sets available in the literature , extracted from analysis of x - ray crystal structures of dna @xcite and from molecular dynamics simulation @xcite .    for the stiffnesses obtained from structural data ,",
    "the missing thermal energy scale is substituted by an `` effective temperature '' .",
    "we here use the effective temperatures determined in a previous study @xcite by equating the total , microscopic fluctuation strengths of the crystal and md covariance matrices .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of all parameters derived from structural data ( b for b - dna crystal and p for protein@xmath158dna cocrystals ) are therefore depend on our choice of effective temperature .",
    "still , their relative magnitudes are properties of the microscopic structural data set independent of this choice .",
    "no such restrictions apply to the md parameters ( md ) , since here the temperature is set by the simulation .",

    "the main model assumption is that thermal deformation fluctuations of neighoring steps are independent .",
    "another limitation of any rigid base  pair model is that _ internal _ deformation fluctuations of a base ",

    "for not too wide distributions , such a center always exists and is unique @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath56 is the standard covariance matrix of @xmath165 in exponential coordinates .",
    "however , for the potential parametrizations considered here , only the equilibrium values @xmath166 and covariance matrices @xmath167 with respect to the global coordinates @xmath168 as defined in @xcite and used in @xcite , are given .",
    "here , @xmath169 are twist , tilt and roll angles but differ from our choice of angles .",
    "the @xmath170 gives the translation vector with respect to the mid - frame @xmath171 .",
    "the conversion formulas are , @xmath172 together determining the frame conformation @xmath173 .",
    "we checked that the variation of the volume element in the region of noticeable probability around @xmath18 is small compared to the variations in the probability density . therefore neglecting the former , we get @xmath174 . in linear order around the equilibrium position",
    ", we can then transform the covariance matrix @xmath175 given in @xmath176-coordinates to exponential coordinates using just the jacobian matrix @xmath177 of the coordinate transition map @xmath178 .",
    "this gives @xmath179 .",
    "we have calculated @xmath180 analytically .",
    "its @xmath2 blocks are @xmath181 all coarse graining calculations presented in this article use the matrices @xmath60 converted in this way as a starting point .",
    "the exponential coordinates of the equilibrium conformations have the usual symmetries under strand change and reading direction reversal : denote by @xmath182 the sequence complementary to @xmath62 , e.g. @xmath183 , and let @xmath184 .",
    "then as @xmath185 , @xmath186 . due to the @xmath42 dependent",
    "coordinate conversion above , the body ",
    "frame covariance matrix does _ not _ obey the corresponding symmetries , @xmath187 .",
    "while this may seem a serious drawback of the coordinate system we use here , it turns out that in the on  axis , shear and helical phase averaged covariance matrices , the strand ",
    "exchange symmetry is re - established .",
    "therefore , our coarse - grained results are indeed independent of the reading sense .",
    "in our coordinates , @xmath188 , so that in a gaussian approximation , @xmath189 here , @xmath190 and @xmath191 are the @xmath2 identity and zero matrices , respectively . in dna ,",
    "the distributions @xmath192 of single steps are very narrow .",
    "therefore when computing moments , in particular the covariance matrix @xmath56 , we can extend the integration boundaries to infinity with negligible error . performing the integral",
    "we then get the relation @xmath193 .",
    "since @xmath194 , in making the approximation @xmath195 , we introduce an error of less than 1% for typical b - dna steps .",
    "i.e.  the stiffness matrix @xmath196 is indeed given by the inverse of the covariance ."
