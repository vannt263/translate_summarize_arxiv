    "energetic feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is thought to prevent the cooling of hot gas in galaxies and clusters of galaxies , delaying or suppressing star formation in these objects @xcite .",
    "however , the mechanism that controls the level of activity is not well known .",
    "the agn located at the centres of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) can play an important role in preventing the development of `` cooling flows '' , which would have developed in the absence of the agn feedback @xcite .",
    "however , agn feedback in cool cores of clusters is often subject to a global thermal instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even if the thermal instability does not develop with the aid of thermal conduction or cosmic rays @xcite , the agn must respond quickly , on a dynamical or a sound crossing timescale in the core , to the change of the environment ( e.g. gas density and temperature ) to maintain the balance between the heating and the radiative cooling .",
    "the bondi accretion @xcite is a promising route for the gas supply to the central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the bcgs .",
    "since accretion rate depends on the density and temperature of the surrounding hot gas ( see equation  [ eq : dotmb ] ) , the agn activity can respond accordingly to the change of the state of this gas .",
    "the agn feedback to the bondi accretion has been detected by studying 9 nearby , x - ray luminous elliptical galaxies ( not all of them being bcgs ) with _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite ; a correlation between the bondi accretion rates ( inferred from the observed gas temperature and density profiles , and smbh masses ) and the agn power ( in the form of relativistic jets ) has been shown to exist .",
    "successive studies have confirmed this correlation @xcite , although observational uncertainties exist @xcite .    for bcgs in general ,",
    "the correlation has not been firmly established , partly because observational uncertainties appear to be substantial due to the large average distance to the bcgs . moreover",
    ", apparent jet powers seem to be insufficient to compensate for the radiative cooling of cool cores of some clusters @xcite . as an alternative to the bondi hot gas accretion",
    ", cold gas accretion may work .",
    "in fact , cold gas has been detected in many elliptical galaxies including bcgs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and some of them even have cold gas discs @xcite , which could power the jets . while the cold gas accretion is generally more efficient in producing the agn radiation , the associated accretion processes could involve complicated physics , such as dynamical instabilities and disc cooling .",
    "thus , it is not certain whether the agn can respond sufficiently quickly and accordingly to the changes in the environment .",
    "finally , no correlation between agn jet power and total molecular gas mass is known to exist @xcite , which suggests that simple accretion of the molecular gas does not control the agn activities in bcgs at low redshifts .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether accretion onto the smbhs in bcgs can be characterised by the bondi accretion in the broad sense , by studying the correlation between the accretion rate and the agn jet power .",
    "we also compare the power available through the bondi accretion with the x - ray agn and cool core luminosities to study the radiation efficiency of the accretion discs and suppression of the cooling flows . for these studies ,",
    "we devise a new method to estimate the bondi accretion rate .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , we describe the details of our method to calculate the bondi accretion rate . the data used in the analysis are presented in section  [ sec : data ] , and the results are provided in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] is devoted to discussion of the smbh accretion and the heating of cluster cool cores .",
    "our main conclusions have been summarised in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we assume cosmological parameters of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , which are often used in this field . unless otherwise noted , errors are the 1  @xmath6 values .",
    "we assume that hot gas accretion onto the smbhs at the centres of our sample galaxies is not dominated by the angular momentum and , therefore , take it to be spherically - symmetric .",
    "the bondi accretion rate is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the smbh mass , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the density and the sound speed at the bondi accretion radius @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath12 depends on the adiabatic index of the accreting gas ( @xmath13 ) and we assume @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the sound speed @xmath16 is the function of gas temperature @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mean molecular weight , and @xmath19 is the proton mass . equation ( [ eq : dotmb ] ) shows that the information on @xmath8 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are required to evaluate @xmath22 . even with the superb angular resolution of _ chandra _ , an expected bondi radius of any system in our sample can not be resolved .",
    "thus , we need to extrapolate the density and temperature at the innermost measurement radius ( @xmath23 ) to those at the bondi radius . in previous studies ,",
    "the extrapolation was made by assuming a power - law for the density profiles and a constant temperature @xcite .",
    "however , it is not certain whether such an assumption is physically justified .",
    "moreover , since the distances to the bcgs are generally large , this method could cause large errors .",
    "thus , a more physical method for the extrapolation is required .    for this extrapolation",
    ", we made two assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the hot gas outside the bondi radius is in a nearly hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the thermal gas pressure , and @xmath26 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "for some nearby clusters ( e.g. perseus ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it has been revealed that the innermost region is strongly disturbed by agn activities .",
    "however , the assumption of the hydrostatic equilibrium can be still acceptable as long as the turbulent and ram pressures associated with the gas motions are smaller than its thermal pressure .",
    "while the actual gas velocity has not been measured , it will be obtained with _ astro - h _ in the near future .",
    "the second assumption is that the gas temperature near the smbh ( i.e. , at @xmath27 ) reflects the velocity dispersion @xmath6 or the virial temperature @xmath28 of the host galaxy : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath31 is the constant of order of unity .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt @xmath32 for massive elliptical galaxies including bcgs .",
    "the second assumption is related to the first one , because the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : hydroeq ] ) is approximated by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the number density of the gas , while the right - hand side is approximated by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the gravitational mass within the radius @xmath37 .",
    "the second assumption , i.e. , equation  ( [ eq : t0 ] ) , is generally consistent with _",
    "x - ray observations @xcite . in section  [ sec : results ] , we discuss the temperature profiles in the central regions of nearby bcgs obtained with recent _ chandra _ observations .",
    "we assume that the temperature profile reflects the size of the galaxy and the profile between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the effective radius ( half - light radius ) of the galaxy .",
    "thus , the temperature decreases toward the galaxy centre in general .",
    "once @xmath43 is determined , the bondi radius @xmath44 can be derived by numerically solving the equation @xmath45 for a given @xmath8 .",
    "the equation of the hydrostatic equilibrium ( equation  [ eq : hydroeq ] ) can be written as @xmath46 since @xmath43 has been determined by equation  ( [ eq : t ] ) , @xmath47 can be obtained by numerically integrating equation  ( [ eq : drhodr ] ) and setting @xmath48 and @xmath26 .",
    "the electron number density is given by @xmath49 .",
    "the gravitational acceleration @xmath50 is given by three components , i.e. , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the smbh contribution , @xmath53 is the galaxy contribution , and @xmath54 comes from the cluster @xcite .",

    "the luminosities are derived by @xcite ; @xmath179 is the x - ray luminosity within which the gas has a cooling time less than @xmath180  yr ( the look - back time for @xmath181 ) , and @xmath182 is the associated ( cooling ) luminosity of gas cooling to low temperatures , derived from the x - ray spectrum .",
    "since @xmath182 could not be determined for a1835 @xcite , we assume @xmath183 for the cluster .",
    "however , since @xmath184 for most other clusters , the assumption will not affect the results strongly .",
    "[ fig : pblc ] indicates that @xmath116 and @xmath176 are tightly correlated .",

    "the index @xmath189 is consistent with unity , which means that @xmath116 is proportional to @xmath176 .",
    "the fact that @xmath190 means that the bondi accretion power is large enough to offset radiative cooling of the cool cores . since @xmath191 on average and @xmath106 , about 1% of the rest mass energy of the accreted gas that passed @xmath44 was used to heat up the cool cores . the correlation described by equation  ( [ eq : fit4 ] )",
    "may reflect the fact that lower entropy ( higher density and/or lower temperature ) of the gas leads to both larger @xmath22 ( equation  [ eq : dotmb ] ) and larger @xmath176 .",
    "however , since @xmath22 is also sensitive to @xmath8 and @xmath26 ( equation  [ eq : drhodr ] ) , the correlation is not obvious .",
    "@xcite showed that no correlation exists between @xmath8 and @xmath176 .",
    "this may indicate that the accretion rate fluctuates with time .",

    "however , for a significant fraction of their sample clusters , they have shown that @xmath192 , which may mean that the jet power alone is not large enough to balance the cooling . combining the relation @xmath193 with our results @xmath194 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mpp ] ) and @xmath195 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pblc ] ) , we obtain @xmath196 . assuming that @xmath197 of the bondi power is used to heat the cool core , a large portion of the bondi power ( @xmath198 ) may be transferred to the icm through the form that does not appear in the jet power @xmath115 estimated from the cavity volumes ( equation  [ eq : ecav ] ) .",
    "this energy can be transferred by the cosmic rays escaping from the cavities @xcite . however , since the agn activities are intermittent , time - averaged jet power @xmath199 may be close to the icm luminosity @xmath176 .",
    "it is also likely that not all cavities have been observed , and that @xmath115 has been underestimated .",
    "the discussions so far are based on the bondi accretion @xcite . however , whether the bondi accretion is actually realised in galaxies have been debated in the literature . for example , small angular momentum of the accreting gas may significantly reduce the accretion rate by introducing a centrifugal barrier @xcite , although viscosity of the hot gas may transport the angular momentum @xcite .",
    "moreover , owing to the high density and the short cooling time of the hot gas around the smbh , thermal instability may develop there and a substantial fraction of the hot gas may turn into cold gas @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that even if this happens , the apparent x - ray temperature does not necessarily decrease near the galactic centre , in spite of the efficient cooling @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ observations show that the hot gas density drops while its temperature is almost constant at @xmath130  kpc from the centre of the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "although the density profile might have been affected by the hot cavities or temporal agn heating , it could also be the result of the removal of the hot gas by the thermal instability which triggers a cold gas flow in the region .",
    "the angular momentum initially retained by turbulent hot gas may decrease after the development of the thermal instability through collisions between cold blobs @xcite , which can also lead to the formation of a turbulent cold disk and develop a large accretion rate at the event horizon of the black hole @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , outflows may significantly modify the accretion flow and may make @xmath200 much smaller than the apparent bondi accretion rate @xmath22 @xcite . if @xmath201 , other energy sources such as black hole spins are required for efficient jet production @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", outflows can solve the problem of low radiative efficiency of the smbhs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : meddlx ] ) , because @xmath165 should reflect @xmath200 , which could be much smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "the correlations found in this study do not necessary mean that the accretion flows in bcgs are represented by the ` classical ' and oversimplified bondi accretion flow .",
    "significant departures from such a flow , which involve angular momentum , multi - phase gas , and time- and space - averaging should be expected .",
    "hence the hot gas accretion flows appear to reflect the bondi model in some broad sense . at least , it reflects the density and temperature ( or entropy ) of the hot gas at @xmath94 ( @xmath20270  kpc ; table  [ tab : obs ] ) , because we estimated @xmath44 and @xmath203 from them .",
    "for example , the thermal instability turns on at some radius @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) , and the emerging cold gas flow ( @xmath206 ) is influenced by the boundary conditions at @xmath94 .",
    "we have investigated the bondi accretion onto the smbhs in bcgs . for that purpose",
    ", we devised a new method to estimate the bondi accretion rate even when the bondi radius is under - resolved in the x - ray observations .",
    "our method is based on two assumptions : ( 1 ) the gas is in nearly a hydrostatic equilibrium , and ( 2 ) the gas temperature is represented by the virial temperature of the galaxy near its centre .",
    "we have applied our method to 28 galaxies and have obtained the bondi accretion rates .",
    "we found a correlation between the bondi accretion power and the power of the jets associated with the smbhs .",
    "we also found that the jet power can be well supported by the bondi accretion , in contrast with previous studies .",
    "these results indicate that the agn feedback in the bcgs is controlled by the accretion of the surrounding hot gas , whose origin lies in a stable heating of the cluster cool cores .",
    "the specific growth rates of the smbhs increase as their mass increases , which may explain the existence of hypermassive smbhs ( @xmath207 ) .",
    "the eddington x - ray luminosities of the agn are very small compared to their eddington luminosities , even if the accretion rates are close to the eddington accretion rate .",
    "this may suggest that massive gas accretion with a low radiative efficiency is realised in bcgs .",
    "moreover , we have found that the bondi accretion power correlates linearly with the x - ray luminosities of the cluster cool cores .",
    "we have shown that the power is large enough to offset the radiative cooling of the cool core .",
    "these results may indicate that the cooling of the cool cores is well balanced with the agn feedback associated with the bondi accretion .    while the correlations we found do not necessarily mean that the gas accretion on the smbhs in bcgs follows the simplified bondi prescription , they demonstrate that the accretion onto the smbhs follows it in the broad sense , in some time- and space - averaged sense .",
