    "sigmoidal curves are monotone increasing functions @xmath0 with horizontal asymptotes as @xmath1 , providing mathematical models for transitions between two stable states . in a numerical study of gelation phenomena",
    "@xcite , we observed that the local extrema of the higher derivatives of certain sigmoidal curves tend to accumulate at a certain point . in the search of an analytic description of this ",
    "critical point \" we have seen that the fourier and hilbert transforms were the most appropriate tools .    the standard logistic growth curve is a typical example for a sigmoidal curve with an even first derivative and well known fourier transform properties .",
    "the generalized logistic family provides good examples for sigmoidal curves with no symmetry but the explicit expression of their fourier transform is not available in the literature .",
    "the purpose of this note is to give a detailed derivation of the fourier transform of the first derivative of the generalized logistic family .",
    "the integrals involved in the computation of this fourier transform can be evaluated by certain computer algebra softwares , but we believe that an explicit derivation should be found in the mathematical literature .    the standard logistic growth curve is a sigmoidal curve which is the solution of the differential equation @xmath2 .",
    "this equation can be solved as @xmath3 and its first derivative @xmath4 is the well known @xmath5-soliton solution of the korteweg - devries ( kdv ) equation .",

    "the sigmoidal curve ( [ genlog ] ) reduces to ( [ stalog ] ) for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the fourier transform @xmath14 of an integrable function @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 for all @xmath17 provided that the integral exists in the sense of cauchy principal value @xcite .",
    "we can recover @xmath15 from the inverse transform by @xmath18 for all @xmath19 . since the sigmoidal functions , in particular the standard and generalized logistic growths , are finite as @xmath20 , their first derivatives are in @xmath21 and their fourier transform exists .",
    "the fourier transform of the first derivative @xmath22 of the standard logistic growth solution is obtained easily by using the integral formula @xmath23 as @xmath24 the first derivative of the generalized logistic growth is a localized pulse but it is not symmetrical and the computation of its fourier transform is more complicated . in section 2 ,",
    "equation ( [ fourier - generalized ] ) we obtain this fourier transform explicitly in terms of gamma functions , pointing out certain interesting relations among these and the hypergeometric functions .",
    "we recall that the hypergeometric function @xmath25 is defined by the gauss series as @xmath26 on the disk @xmath27 ( and by analytic continuation elsewhere ) where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the symbol @xmath30 ( also known as pochhammer symbol ) is defined by @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 ( see @xcite and @xcite for details ) .",

    "@xmath40 can be evaluated in terms of the hypergeometric functions using the integral equality @xmath41 which holds for @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "putting @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 in ( [ bookformula ] ) we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the well - known beta function .",
    "it is known that @xmath51 provided @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and @xmath54 since @xmath55 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath56 substituting ( [ aysm - log - indefinite - int ] ) in ( [ asym - log - curve - fourier ] ) @xmath57 and using the equality @xmath58 , we can express the fourier transform of the derivative of the generalized logistic curve as @xmath59",
    "we rewrite the fourier transform pair for the first derivative as , displaying the dependence on the parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 as @xmath62^{-\\frac{1}{\\nu}-1 } e^{-\\beta t},\\cr f(\\omega , k,\\nu)&=&\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\frac{1}{\\gamma(\\frac{1}{\\nu } ) } \\ , e^{-i\\left(\\frac{\\ln k}{\\beta}\\right)\\omega } \\",

    "differentiating @xmath65 with respect to @xmath66 and setting it equal to zero we obtain the location of the maximum of @xmath65 , that we denote by @xmath67 as @xmath68 we recall that a shift of the origin in the time domain by an amount @xmath69 corresponds to the multiplication of the fourier transform by a factor @xmath70 , i.e , if @xmath71 is the fourier transform of @xmath35 , then @xmath72 is the fourier transform of @xmath73 .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath60 has the effect of shifting the origin of the time axis . for @xmath12 , and @xmath11 , the peak of the first derivative of the standard logistic growth",
    "is located at @xmath74 . for @xmath12 , and @xmath75 , the peak shifts left while for @xmath76 it shifts right .",
    "if @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a positive integer greater than @xmath5 , we use the property @xmath79 to express @xmath80 in terms of @xmath81 as @xmath82 this expression is a polynomial multiple of the standard logistic growth . since the fourier transform of the @xmath78th derivative of @xmath35 is @xmath83 , it follows that @xmath84 is a polynomial in the derivatives of @xmath35 .    for arbitrary values of @xmath61 ,",
    "the ( complex ) gamma function with complex arguments can be computed numerically . in our case , as we are interested in the fourier transform @xmath71 for fixed values of the parameters , we need to obtain the graphs of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath85 on vertical lines in the complex plane .",
    "it is known that the gamma functions falls of faster than any polynomial in the imaginary direction , it follows that the fourier transform of all higher derivatives are rapidly decreasing functions . for the cases @xmath77 and @xmath86 , we present the plot of the first derivatives of the generalized logistic growth in figure  [ figtimedomain ] and the plot of the magnitudes of the fourier transform of the first derivatives in figure  [ figmagnitudes ] for the values of @xmath87 ( with @xmath88 ) . by continuity of the gamma function with respect to real part of its argument , the parametric plot of the complex fourier transform for @xmath89 fill the region between the curves corresponding to the integer values of @xmath90 , as shown in figure  [ figparametricplot ]",
