    "as the most massive fermion in the standard model ( sm ) , the top quark is believed to be sensitive to new physics@xcite . since the measurements of top quark properties in run  1 at the fermilab tevatron have only small statistics , there remains plenty of room for new physics to be discovered in future precision measurements .",
    "such possibilities exist on our horizon : while the upgraded tevatron collider will significantly improve the precision of the top quark measurements , the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the planned next - generation linear collider ( nlc ) will serve as top quark factories and allow precision measurements of the top quark properties  @xcite .",
    "although various exotic production processes @xcite and rare decay modes @xcite of the top quark will serve as robust evidence for new physics ( since these exotic processes are forbidden or severely suppressed in the sm ) , the role of the dominant decay mode @xmath7 in probing new physics should not be underestimated @xcite .",
    "one advantage of this decay mode is that it is free of non - perturbative theoretical uncertainties @xcite and future precision experimental data can therefore be compared with accurate theoretical predictions .",
    "the other advantage of this channel is that the @xmath1-boson as decay product is strongly polarized and the helicity contents ( transverse - plus @xmath8 , transverse - minus @xmath9 and longitudinal @xmath10 ) of the @xmath1-boson can be probed through a measurement of the shape of the lepton spectrum in the @xmath1-boson decay @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of top decay into a polarized @xmath1-boson will provide additional information about the @xmath11 coupling - boson in top decay , the longitudinal mode is of particular interest since it is relevant for the understanding of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism . ] and has so far attracted a lot of attention from both theorists and experimentalists . on the experimental side ,",
    "the cdf collaboration has already performed the measurement of the helicity component of the @xmath1-boson in top quark decay from run  1 data and obtained the results @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total decay rate of @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote respectively the rates into a longitudinal and transverse - plus @xmath1-boson . although the error of these measurements is quite large at the present time , it is expected to be reduced significantly during run  2 of the tevatron and may reach @xmath17 at the lhc @xcite . on the theoretical side , predictions of these quantities in the sm up to one - loop level are now available @xcite . for the mass values of refs.@xcite ,",
    "the tree - level results are 0.703 for @xmath18 , 0.297 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and the qcd corrections to these predictions are respectively @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , while the electroweak corrections are at the level of a few per mill .    in order to probe new physics from the future precise measurement of @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath21 , we must know the new physics contributions to these quantities in various models . in this article",
    "we focus on the supersymmetric contributions in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) . in this model",
    "the one - loop corrections to the total width of @xmath25 have been studied by several groups @xcite .",
    "however , the corrections to @xmath18 , @xmath19 or @xmath21 are still lacking and calculating these corrections is the major goal of this article .    in the mssm the genuine supersymmetric corrections ( i.e. , the corrections from various sparticle loops ) are susy electroweak ( susy - ew ) corrections , arising from interactions of charginos or neutralinos , and susy - qcd corrections , arising from interactions of gluinos . are not unique to the mssm since they also exist in the general two - higgs - doublet models .",
    "such corrections are found to be less than @xmath4 for the whole parameter space @xcite .",
    "therefore we do not calculate such corrections in this paper . ]",
    "the susy - ew and susy - qcd corrections to the total width were first investigated in @xcite without considering squark mixings , and later were re - studied extensively in @xcite by taking into account the squark mixings . although our aim in this paper is to study the corrections to @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath21 , we will also repeat the calculations of the corrections to the total width for two reasons : one of the reasons is that the previous susy - ew calculations were performed many years ago and some susy parameter space viable at that time has been ruled out by recent experiments .",
    "the other reason is that the susy - ew corrections to the total width were found to be exceptionally large ( exceeds @xmath6 in a large part of parameter space ) @xcite and should , therefore , be checked carefully .",
    "in fact we find they are much smaller for reasons we will discuss .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present relevant formula for our calculations . in section iii , susy - ew corrections are calculated and compared with previous studies . in section iv , we examine susy - qcd corrections . for the numerical calculations of both susy - ew and susy - qcd corrections ,",
    "we first perform a scan in the typical allowed parameter space to find out the typical size of the corrections , and then consider some special scenarios ( such as a very light sbottom or gluino ) to figure out if the corrections are exceptionally large in some regions of parameter space .",
    "the conclusions are given in section v.",
    "in this section we present the formulas for calculating new physics contributions to @xmath25 in the so - called `` @xmath26-scheme '' @xcite where the fermi constant @xmath26 and the pole masses @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are chosen as input parameters .",

    "although the susy - ew correction turns out to be quite small ( below one percent in size ) in the dominant part of the allowed parameter space , we found from our scan that the correction can reach a few percent in some narrow corners of the parameter space .",
    "these corners have two feathers : ( 1 ) @xmath118 so that the lighter chargino and the lightest neutralino are higgsino - like , and @xmath102 is large so that the @xmath0-quark yukawa couplings in quark - squark - higgsino interactions can be greatly enhanced  @xcite ; ( 2 ) the two sparticles in a self - energy loop of top quark lie below the threshold , or in other words , the sum of the masses of the two sparticles is lighter than top quark mass . generally speaking ,",
