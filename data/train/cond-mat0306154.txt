    "it will be useful to write explicitly the general duality transformation ( [ x_star ] ) applied to the specific case of the @xmath0 ising model for later use , namely , for the case @xmath64 .",
    "again we first write the formula for the simple case of @xmath16 written in equation ( [ dual_2 ] ) so that the reader understands the structure : @xmath65 the general formula is @xmath66      in the present subsection the edge boltzmann factors are regarded as functions of the parameters of the @xmath0 ising model following equation ( [ generalxn ] ) , @xmath67 .",
    "the partition function @xmath68 is invariant under the change of the sign of coupling constant @xmath69 at all bonds if the system is on the square lattice .",
    "this change of the sign exchanges @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and consequently , according to equation ( [ generalxn ] ) , @xmath33 is exchanged with @xmath72 : @xmath73 combination of two symmetries , duality ( [ zn_duality ] ) and change of sign of @xmath35 ( [ zn_inv1 ] ) , leads to another symmetry . on the right - hand side of equation ( [ t - expansion ] )",
    "the change of sign of @xmath74 is equivalent to the change of the sign of @xmath75 for odd @xmath34 .",
    "the left - hand side of equation ( [ t - expansion ] ) suggests that the change of sign of @xmath74 is also realized by exchange of @xmath58 and @xmath76 .",
    "then we conclude in equation ( [ x_star ] ) that the change of sign of @xmath33 for odd @xmath34 on the right - hand side @xmath77 should be performed simultaneously with the exchange of @xmath59 and @xmath78 to keep this duality equation valid . using duality ( [ zn_duality ] )",
    "we therefore find the following symmetry , @xmath79 the second equality comes from equation ( [ zn_inv1 ] ) and the final relation is duality ( [ zn_duality ] ) .",
    "when the number of replicas is even @xmath80 , the partition function has additional symmetry which exchanges @xmath33 with @xmath81 for @xmath34 odd only : @xmath82 it is convenient to start the proof from the following expression of the edge boltzmann factors generalizing equation ( [ generalxn ] ) , @xmath83 where the sum runs over @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the @xmath0 ising model .",
    "we would like the @xmath33 with @xmath87 even to remain invariant and the @xmath33 with @xmath88 odd to be changed into @xmath89 .",
    "as one can see from equation ( [ general_edgebf ] ) , this may be considered to be a transformation @xmath90 for odd @xmath88 only : @xmath91 the sign @xmath92 actually corresponds to the sign of @xmath93 for neighbouring sites @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 , because @xmath93 is @xmath98 for even number of antiparallel pairs and is @xmath99 otherwise .",
    "the formula ( [ general_edgebf ] ) can be written as @xmath100 where @xmath34 pairs among @xmath101 pairs of neighbouring spins are antiparallel @xmath102 .",
    "changing @xmath103 as @xmath104 amounts to changing the edge boltzmann factor as follows : @xmath105 in other words this is equivalent to performing for each replica a non - trivial mattis transformation depending on all the other replicas : @xmath106 note that , as far as dummy variables to be summed on are concerned , the @xmath107 s are as good as the @xmath108 s : this is a one - to - one change of variables .",
    "actually one goes back from the @xmath107 s to the @xmath108 s by performing the same transformation as the one defining the @xmath107 s : @xmath109 we have used the identity @xmath110 .",
    "therefore this mattis transformation is an involution , and we have proved equation ( [ xm_sign_change ] ) which is equivalent to the symmetry ( [ zn_mirror ] ) .",
    "let us point out another interesting symmetry of the partition function which can be derived from a combination of symmetries discussed so far .",
    "if we denote the duality transformation ( [ x_star ] ) symbolically as @xmath111 and the exchange of @xmath33 and @xmath81 for even @xmath7 and odd @xmath34 in equation ( [ zn_mirror ] ) as @xmath112 , the combination @xmath113 also leaves the partition function invariant as long as the system satisfies the conditions for @xmath111 and @xmath112 to be the true symmetry such as the lattice structure ( square lattice ) and even @xmath7 .",
    "this duality - like symmetry under the transformation @xmath114 will be used in the next subsection .",
    "it is worth noticing here that @xmath111 and @xmath112 commute for @xmath7 even ( @xmath115 ) , and @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath114 are all involutions , @xmath116 .",
    "the @xmath0 ising model with quenched randomness has remarkable properties along a line ( curve ) in the phase diagram defined by the relation @xmath117 known as the nishimori line ( nl ) @xcite .",
    "similar interesting behaviour is observed on the same line also in the replicated system with @xmath16 @xcite . in this subsection",
    "we analyze symmetries of the replicated system with general integer @xmath7 under the condition ( [ n_cond ] ) using the results of previous subsections .",
    "let us consider the @xmath0 ising model on the square lattice whose parameters satisfy equation ( [ n_cond ] ) . from equations ( [ generalxn ] ) and ( [ n_cond ] ) , the latter being equivalent to @xmath118 and @xmath119 , it is straightforward to see that the following relations hold : @xmath120 the condition ( [ n_cond ] ) reduces the degree of freedom from two ( @xmath4 and @xmath35 ) to one .",
    "this means that we restrict ourselves to a one - dimensional curve in the @xmath121-dimensional space @xmath122 .",
    "it will be useful to relax this constraint and consider the @xmath123 + 1)$]-dimensional submanifold of @xmath122 specified only by equation ( [ n_subvariety ] ) , where @xmath124 $ ] stands for the largest integer not exceeding @xmath125 .",
    "we shall call this submanifold the subvariety @xmath126 : @xmath127 the subvariety @xmath126 of course includes the one - dimensional curve nl specified by equation ( [ n_cond ] ) : nl @xmath128 .    by the duality ( [ x_star ] )",
    ", @xmath126 is transformed into the dual @xmath129 satisfying @xmath130 to prove this fact , we first note that the condition ( [ n_subvariety ] ) implies that the coefficient of @xmath131 on the right - hand side of equation ( [ x_star ] ) is @xmath132 where we have written the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath75 explicitly",
    ". then the relation ( [ n_dual ] ) follows if we can show @xmath133 the left - hand side of which is the coefficient of @xmath134 of @xmath135 in equation ( [ x_star ] ) and the right - hand side is for @xmath134 of @xmath136 .",
    "equation ( [ d_rel1 ] ) can be proved by induction with respect to @xmath7 : the validity for small @xmath137 is checked trivially .",
    "let us assume that that equation ( [ d_rel1 ] ) is valid for @xmath7 .",
    "then it is not difficult to show that the same equation holds for @xmath138 using the following recursion relation @xmath139 which is derived by multiplying both sides of equation ( [ t - expansion ] ) by @xmath140 ( which amounts to the change @xmath141 ) .",
    "this ends the proof .",
    "comparison of equations ( [ n_subvariety ] ) and ( [ n_dual ] ) suggests that the subvariety @xmath126 is in general not self - dual , @xmath142 .",
    "when @xmath7 is even @xmath80 , the partition function has an additional symmetry ( [ zn_mirror ] ) , @xmath112 in the notation of equation ( [ d2 ] ) .",
    "then the combined transformation @xmath143 keeps the subvariety invariant , @xmath144 : the application of @xmath114 to @xmath126 is shown to yield the same relation as equation ( [ n_subvariety ] ) @xmath145 the proof is outlined in [ sec : appendixa ] .",
    "we therefore conclude that the subvariety @xmath126 is _ globally self - dual _ when @xmath7 is even , that is , any point in the submanifold defined by equation ( [ n_subvariety ] ) is mapped by @xmath114 to another point in the same submanifold ( but is not fixed point - by - point in general ) .",
    "the edge boltzmann matrix @xmath31 with generic values of the elements @xmath146 has a remarkable property that its inverse matrix has the same structure ; the inverse matrix has the same arrangement of elements as the original matrix . to show this we first note that the entries of the boltzmann matrix are defined up to a common multiplicative factor , and therefore we can also discuss , instead of the matrix inversion @xmath147 , a homogeneous matrix inversion transformation @xmath148 ( actually a homogeneous polynomial transformation ) : @xmath149 let us also introduce the homogeneous transformation @xmath150 corresponding to the inversion of elements of the dual matrix ( hadamard inverse ) , @xmath151 , is analogous to negating various coupling constants . ]",
    "@xmath152 at first sight , performing the matrix inversion of the @xmath153 boltzmann matrix @xmath154 may seem to yield quite large calculations .",
    "however , since the duality transformation actually diagonalizes matrix @xmath155 as was mentioned in relation to equation ( [ general_diagonal ] ) , it is straightforward to see that the matrix inversion _ just amounts to changing the dual variables @xmath156 into their simple inverse _ : @xmath157 . from this remark , it is straightforward to see that the matrix inverse of @xmath154 is a @xmath153 matrix of the same form as the original @xmath155 ( but of course with different elements : @xmath158 ) . with obvious notations , and since there is no possible confusion , we will also denote by @xmath148 this transformation on the @xmath159 s : @xmath160 up to a common multiplicative factor one thus has ( since @xmath161 is an involution , that is , @xmath162 ) : @xmath163    * remark :* one should recall that the two involutions @xmath164 and @xmath165 are _ actually ( non - linear ) symmetries _ of the phase diagrams of ( anisotropic ) spin edge lattice models  @xcite . from equation ( [ did ] )",
    "one sees that these `` non - linear '' symmetries of the phase diagrams are closely related to the ( linear ) duality symmetry .",
    "a duality symmetry exists when the edge boltzmann matrix corresponds to cyclic matrices or semi - direct product of cyclic matrices  @xcite .",
    "however , when a _ duality symmetry does not exist _ , like for instance the ising model in a magnetic field , the two `` non - linear '' symmetries @xmath164 and @xmath165 _ still exist and can still be used to analyse the phase diagram _  @xcite .",
    "the elements of the dual edge boltzmann factors of the replicated @xmath0 ising model ( [ xmstar_pmj ] ) have an interesting symmetry .",
    "it is instructive to take the ratios of @xmath166 to @xmath167 ( which is equivalent to setting the energy level of all - parallel state to 0 ) : @xmath168 it is observed that the right - hand side is multiplied by @xmath169 each time the number of antiparallel spin pairs @xmath58 increases .",
    "another factor @xmath170 appears alternately .",
    "therefore the right - hand side of equation ( [ dual_bf5 ] ) can be expressed as a simple boltzmann factor of the dual system , @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the product of neighbouring dual spins in the @xmath173th replica @xmath174 , and @xmath175 and @xmath176 are the dual couplings corresponding to thermal and randomness parameters : @xmath177 this expression ( [ dualbf0 ] ) has a very interesting interpretation .",
    "the first part can be interpreted as being driven by thermal fluctuations since it has only the ( dual ) thermal coupling @xmath45 in front of the spin variables .",
    "this first term is decoupled explicitly from the second part which is understood to be driven by quenched randomness as it is controlled by the ( dual ) coupling @xmath178 determined only by @xmath4 .",
    "the first term causes ferromagnetic ordering of dual spin variables whereas the second term enhances spin - glass - like multi - replica ordering .",
    "the condition ( [ n_cond ] ) is written in terms of the dual couplings as @xmath179 . therefore , on the nl , the above - mentioned two types of ordering tendency exactly balance .",
    "this reminds us of the result that the ferromagnetic ordering dominates above the nl whereas spin - glass order is larger below @xcite .",
    "the balance @xmath180 may also be called enhanced symmetry because the single - replica and the multi - replica terms have exactly the same coupling .",
    "it should be pointed out that a larger type of enhanced symmetry is realized by the @xmath38-state standard scalar potts model which has the edge boltzmann factor @xmath181 with all couplings equal @xmath182 : it is straightforward to confirm that this boltzmann factor has just two values , one for @xmath183 and the other for all other configurations , thus representing the standard scalar potts model .",
    "these two models , the @xmath0 ising model ( [ dualbf0 ] ) on the nl ( with @xmath179 ) and the @xmath38-state standard scalar potts model ( [ dual_bf2 ] ) ( with @xmath182 ) , coincide when @xmath16 but not in general .",
    "we may therefore regard the @xmath7-replicated @xmath0 ising model on the nl as a system with similar but a little weaker symmetry than the standard scalar potts model with @xmath38 states . another point",
    "to notice is that the original boltzmann factors ( [ generalxn ] ) of the @xmath0 ising model are not expressible in a simple form like equation ( [ dualbf0 ] ) : if we try to do so by adjusting the coupling constants in equation ( [ dual_bf2 ] ) , each @xmath184 will appear with a different value from the other coefficients .",
    "only the dual system has the simple form of the edge boltzmann factor ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "the effective edge boltzmann factor ( [ dualbf0 ] ) shows that the replicated @xmath0 ising model in the dual representation has a relatively simple hamiltonian with positive ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "this fact enables us to analyze the model using known results on ferromagnetic spin systems .",
    "one of our interests to be discussed later will be the structure of the phase diagram of the @xmath7-replicated system .",
    "the phase diagram drawn in terms of the original parameters @xmath4 and @xmath186 should look topologically the same as the one with axes @xmath187 and @xmath175 because @xmath187 is a monotone increasing function of @xmath4 and @xmath175 is also monotonic in @xmath186 ( see figure [ fig : generic - phase - diagram ] ) . note that in the present paper we call the point marked in black dot in figure [ fig : generic - phase - diagram ] the multicritical point irrespective of the order of transition .",

    "we first check a few limiting cases . according to the dual boltzmann factor ( [ dualbf0 ] ) , when @xmath188 ( @xmath189 ) , the system decouples into @xmath7 independent ferromagnetic ising models as expected .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath190 ( or the low - temperature limit @xmath191 in the original variable ) , only the multi - replica coupling @xmath176 survives in equation ( [ dualbf0 ] ) . by redefining spins as @xmath192 , the system reduces to a simple ferromagnetic ising model .",
    "the critical point exists at @xmath193 , where @xmath194 is the critical point of the ferromagnetic ising model satisfying @xmath195 .",
    "therefore the original system in the ground state has a critical point at @xmath196 ( derived from @xmath197 ) irrespective of @xmath7 as long as @xmath7 is a positive integer .",
    "note that the quenched limit @xmath8 is expected to have a different critical probability @xmath198 near 0.89 ( see the next section ) .",
    "this observation means that the two limits @xmath8 and @xmath191 do not commute .",
    "the other limit @xmath199 corresponds to @xmath200 in the original variable . according to equation ( [ dualbf0 ] ) ,",
    "the dual spins are then constrained as @xmath201 .",
    "it follows that the @xmath7th spin variable can be expressed as @xmath202 .",

    "the duality transformation @xmath328 exchanges these two phase boundaries ; the uniqueness assumption of the transition point is not satisfied in this case below the multicritical point .",

    "it is worth pointing out that the condition @xmath309 together with equation ( [ dualzn2 ] ) automatically means that the values of @xmath313 on both sides are equal @xmath333 and consequently the arguments are equal @xmath332 .",
    "therefore the fixed point condition of the principal edge boltzmann factor @xmath309 suffices to identify the transition point ( assuming it is unique ) in the highly symmetric case of the standard scalar potts model .",

    "we nevertheless proceed by trying an ansatz that the fixed point condition of the principal component of the edge boltzmann matrix @xmath338 may lead to the exact location of the transition point if we restrict ourselves to the nl in the subvariety @xmath126 .",

    "one may wish to try a different fixed point condition like @xmath322 to investigate the possible location of the transition point .",
    "a physical reason to choose @xmath309 , not the other ones , is that this edge boltzmann factor @xmath14 is special in the sense that it is for the all - parallel spin configuration , and the expression of duality in equation ( [ dualzn2 ] ) , which singles out @xmath14 as a special variable , means to measure the energy relative to the perfectly ferromagnetic state .",

    "a preliminary scan of the energy showed that the transition is very likely to be of first order since clear hysteresis has been found .",
    "this is natural because the system has eight(@xmath374 ) degrees of freedom at each site and is not very far from the eight - state standard scalar potts model ( which has a first - order transition ) because of the enhanced symmetry @xmath375 on the nl ( a little short of the high symmetry @xmath376 of the standard scalar potts model ) .",
    "we have therefore used the non - equilibrium relaxation method ( @xcite and references therein ) , which allows us to simulate very large systems in its initial relaxation stage to investigate equilibrium properties .",
    "another reason to use the non - equilibrium relaxation method is that it allows us to identify the first - order transition point without evaluating the free energy @xcite .",
    "the results for the relaxation of magnetization are drawn in figure [ fig : ner ] for the temperature range from @xmath377 ( top curve ) to @xmath378 ( bottom curve ) with linear system size @xmath379 , averaged over several samples , under mixed phase initialization appropriate for first - order transition @xcite .",

    "our conclusion is @xmath382 , which is consistent with the above - mentioned conjecture 1.65858 .",

    "there have been a number of numerical studies of quenched systems ( @xmath384 ) to find the location of multicritical point on the square lattice . if we take the limit @xmath384 in equation ( [ fixed - k ] ) , the formula rewritten in terms of @xmath4 acquires a simple and appealing expression suggesting that exactly half of the entropy of bond distribution is exhausted at @xmath198 : @xmath385 numerically this equation gives @xmath386 , which is compared very favourably with numerical results , among which 0.8894(9 ) is the most recent and extensive one @xcite , as well as 0.8905(5 ) @xcite , 0.886(3 ) @xcite , 0.8906(2 ) @xcite and 0.8907(2 ) @xcite .",

    "numerical results are consistent with this value , 1.00(2 ) ( y ozeki , private communication ) .    for the random chiral potts model with @xmath391 under the nl condition @xcite @xmath392 the conjectured multicritical point coming from @xmath309 is in the quenched limit , using equations ( [ xkq ] ) and ( [ xkqd ] ) , @xmath393 note that the model with equation ( [ chiralpotts ] ) reduces to the non - random case in the limit @xmath394 in contrast to our previous convention of @xmath189 ; the reason is to avoid confusion when we compare our conjecture with the numerical investigation which suggests @xmath198 between 0.079 and 0.080 for @xmath395 @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ pottspc ] ) yields @xmath396 for @xmath395 . we therefore conclude that the condition @xmath309 has been confirmed to give the correct transition point on the nl within numerical accuracies for all available cases .",

    "this result suggests that the behaviour of the system is simpler in this subvariety than at generic points even if the problem is not ( generically ) integrable because the exponential growth excludes integrability .",
    "conjecture on the exact location of the multicritical point on the nl has been presented based on the duality and symmetry arguments .",
    "reasons have been explained that the intersection of the curve @xmath309 and the nl is the only plausible candidate of the multicritical point among a set of similar conjectures ( @xmath397 plus the nl ) .",
    "numerical results are in very good agreement with this conjecture .",
    "nevertheless , recalling the situation already encountered for the analysis of the phase diagram of the isotropic three - state chiral potts model  @xcite , where the critical manifold is numerically extremely close to the self - dual condition @xmath398 but is possibly mathematically different ( in contrast with the situation encountered in the symmetric ashkin - teller model ) , one can not discard the possibility that , restricted to the nl , the transition point could be numerically extremely close to the intersection with @xmath398 but , actually , mathematically different .",
    "these points need to be further investigated carefully",
    ".    it may be useful to consider the possibility that the condition @xmath309 could be a very good approximation of the transition manifold away from the intersection with @xmath126 but in the high temperature part of the phase boundary as in figure [ fig : phase_diagram_n=2 ] at least for random ferromagnetic spin systems .",
    "for the @xmath260-state random standard ferromagnetic potts model ( the random version of the ferromagnetic scalar potts model ) , the condition @xmath309 in the quenched limit is @xmath399 where the positive interaction @xmath35 is assumed to be distributed with measure @xmath400 .",
    "this is a potts - generalization of equation ( [ ising_boundary ] ) .",
    "investigation of the consequences of this equation is going on .",
    "another interesting observation is that the formula ( [ fixed - k ] ) gives @xmath35 as a function of @xmath7 which diverges as @xmath7 approaches @xmath99 .",
    "it is not obvious at all that we can apply this formula to such a limit , but _",
    "if _ we do so , then the divergence of @xmath35 implies that the transition point on the nl is @xmath401 as @xmath247 .",
    "if we use the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath138 in equation ( [ znzn1 ] ) , we find that the transition point of the @xmath8 ( quenched ) system vanishes at @xmath200 .",
    "although we should be very careful to apply our results to such a limit of negative @xmath7 , this last result is reasonable and interesting in its own right because it supports the usual consensus that the two - dimensional ising spin glass does not have a finite - temperature phase transition when the distribution of bond randomness is symmetric .",
    "more efforts should be devoted to the investigation of this problem .",
    "let us also comment here on the equivalence between the @xmath7-replicated 3@xmath402 random lattice gauge theory and its dual , the @xmath7-replicated ising spin ferromagnet with edge boltzmann factor described in section [ sec : dualbf ] .",
    "all the arguments sections [ sec : dualbf ] and [ sec : ineqbf ] apply to such a case . in particular the bound on the critical probability like ( [ pc - bound2 ] ) results : @xmath403 . numerically it is 0.97 @xcite .",
    "transition point , not for the multicritical point , but is likely to be close to the latter . ]    we have seen that the replica analysis naturally yields to consider a class of remarkable ( non - random ) lattice spin models , defined by equation ( [ general_bm ] ) , which are highly structured and for which extensive symmetry analysis can be performed exactly .",
    "recalling domany s @xmath404 terminology @xcite , these models correspond to highly symmetric specific @xmath405 models and , more generally @xmath406 models .",
    "these singled - out classes of lattice spin edge models provide a very powerful tool of analysis for many spin - glass problems and are also worth studying _ per se_.    one should note that many of the exact calculations , displayed in this paper , are still valid when the distribution of the coupling constants is not of the @xmath407 type or some continuous distribution like equation ( [ generaln ] ) but , for instance , a two - delta - peaks @xmath408 distribution , or , even , a totally general distribution : we only need to get an effective boltzmann matrix of the hierarchical form ( [ general_bm ] ) .",
    "one should also underline that these models can straightforwardly be generalized to chiral potts models ( see [ sec : appendixb ] ) , and also to spin models without any wu - wang duality ( like the ising model with a magnetic field , see [ sec : appendixb ] ; the non - linear inversion relations @xmath148 and @xmath150 taking the place of the linear duality transformation @xmath409 ) , providing room for many new exact results on spin - glass problems .",

    "this equation can be proved by induction with respect to @xmath260 .",
    "the following relation will be useful for the proof : @xmath415 which is derived by replacing @xmath58 in equation ( [ t - expansion ] ) with @xmath416 ( which amounts to multiplying both sides by @xmath417 ) .",
    "it is easy to check explicitly using equation ( [ dmk ] ) that the target relation ( [ dm1 ] ) is valid for small @xmath260 with any @xmath58 and @xmath34 .",
    "let us then assume that this equation holds for @xmath260 with any @xmath58 and @xmath34 and show that the same is true for @xmath418 .",
