    "qcd in the limit of infinite heavy quarks has received much interest over the past years ( cf .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the theory simplifies considerably in that limit and though it still does not allow a complete calculation of hadronic matrix elements , it poses some conditions on and gives relations between them that can be used to reduce the model  dependence of the analysis of experimental data .",
    "its phenomenological relevance is however limited by the fact that quark masses are finite .",
    "generally , matrix elements determined in the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) receive corrections due to the finite quark mass .",
    "since we are dealing with a field theory that has to be renormalized , the corrections are not pure powers , but are modified by large logarithms of type @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the heavy quark mass and @xmath6 some hadronic scale .",
    "physically , the logarithms are due to the radiation of high energetic gluons off the heavy quark .",
    "although in certain cases some terms in the expansion can be shown to be small or absent ( as is the case with luke s theorem @xcite ) , in general they will introduce new unknown quantities order by order in the heavy quark expansion . if hqet is supposed to yield results of phenomenological relevance",
    ", it is thus of paramount importance to keep those corrections under control .    in the present paper",
    "we address the question of @xmath0 corrections to one specific matrix element , the leptonic decay constant @xmath7 of a pseudoscalar meson @xmath8 with momentum @xmath9 , built of the heavy quark @xmath10 and the light anti ",
    "quark @xmath11 : @xmath12 from the analysis of potential models @xcite , it was known long since that @xmath13 approaches a constant as @xmath5 becomes infinitely heavy .",
    "the next step in unravelling the mysteries of @xmath7 was the discovery that the simple square  root like behaviour gets modified by logarithmic terms @xcite . after the development of the formal framework of heavy quark qcd as an effective theory @xcite , @xmath14 was soon subject to numerical studies on the lattice @xcite and by qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "after some fluctuations , the results now agree within the errors : @xmath15 the value of @xmath16 , the decay constant of the b meson , that can be derived from the above value is however considerably bigger than values obtained in `` full qcd '' without reference to hqet @xcite . since @xmath16 is an important quantity in many applications like @xmath17@xmath18 mixing , e.g.  ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , its knowlegde is of great importance and thus requires a careful analysis of finite mass corrections to @xmath14 .",
    "according to estimates of various authors , @xmath0 corrections to the heavy quark limit amount to about 20% @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have treated higher order corrections based on a `` higher twist '' expansion of a qcd sum rule for @xmath16 .",
    "an explicit expansion in inverse powers of @xmath5 did not prove feasible since the expansion of all parameters inherent in the sum rule analysis in inverse powers of @xmath5 is by no means unique .",
    "instead we defined the `` correction term '' to be the difference between qcd and hqet result . in the range @xmath19 the corrections proved to be dominated by the linear term in the heavy quark expansion . on the other hand , in @xcite an attempt was made to compute @xmath0 directly in hqet , but still relied heavily on the expansion of sum rule parameters in @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 terms are about a factor of three larger than the correction obtained in @xcite .",
    "thus we feel the necessity to complement our old calculation by a corresponding one where the @xmath0 terms are investigated entirely in hqet .",
    "moreover , such an calculation offers the possibility to include next  to  leading order renormalization group effects studied recently in @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in we recall the formal framework of hqet and give necessary definitions , deals with the heavy quark expansion of correlation functions , in we attempt an approximate non  perturbative calculation of the relevant matrix elements in hqet by qcd sum rules .",
    "the last section , , is devoted to the presentation of the results and their discussion .",
    "before starting with `` heavy '' calculations , let us recall the main features of hqet .",
    "the heavy quark field @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the projector on the upper components of the heavy quark field @xmath23 , @xmath5 is the mass of the heavy quark , and @xmath24 its four  velocity .",
    "the contribution of the lower components to the qcd lagrangian can be integrated out and the new effective lagrangian be expanded in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass we understand the pole mass whose precise definition will be given in ( [ eq : polemass ] ) . ]",

    "does not get renormalized @xcite , whereas the chromomagnetic interaction operator , @xmath28 acquires an anomalous dimension @xmath29 @xcite that gives rise to the wilson coefficient @xmath30 .    in hqet",
    ", the heavy quark does not take part in the dynamics of a process that is essentially determined by the hadron s light degrees of freedom . as a consequence ,",
    "the heavy quark spin becomes a `` good '' quantum number and the theory exhibits the famous spin  symmetry , but in a so to speak controlled manner that is induced by @xmath31 and only affects the traces over spin wave functions . ] which leads to a factorization of matrix elements into terms describing the spin  structure of the involved hadrons ( and their interaction ) and terms describing the dynamics of the process that is independent of the heavy quarks .",

    "group behaviour proves necessary .",

    "moreover , there is not only the one  particle ground state , but also radial excitations and multi  particle states contribute to the singularities of @xmath169 .",
    "although it seems natural to assume that contributions of multi  particle states be suppressed by creation amplitudes , one still has to deal with both the unwanted contributions from radial excitations and unknown terms in the ope stemming from higher  dimensional condensates .    to this end , it proved extremely useful in many applications to subject @xmath169 to a borel transformation , a tool , that likewise was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the borel transform @xmath170 of a function @xmath14 depending on the euclidean momentum @xmath171 is defined as @xmath172    the dimensionful quantity replacing @xmath107 is @xmath173 , the borel parameter . applied to a dispersion relation over the physical spectral function @xmath174 , e.g. , the borel transformation yields @xmath175 thus contributions of @xmath176 become exponentially suppressed for large @xmath177 , the suppression being controlled by the value of @xmath173 .",
