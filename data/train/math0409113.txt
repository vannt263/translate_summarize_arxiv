    "in this section , we introduce the related works , motivation and the problems that we are facing .      the concept of fuzzy sets was introduced by zadeh in 1965  @xcite . since",
    "then fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic have been applied in many real applications to handle uncertainty .",
    "the traditional fuzzy set uses one real number @xmath0 $ ] to represent the grade of membership of fuzzy set @xmath1 defined on universe @xmath2 .",
    "sometimes @xmath3 itself is uncertain and hard to be defined by a crisp value .",
    "so the concept of interval valued fuzzy sets was proposed  @xcite to capture the uncertainty of grade of membership .",
    "interval valued fuzzy set uses an interval value @xmath4 $ ] with @xmath5 to represent the grade of membership of fuzzy set @xmath1 . in some applications such as expert system , belief system and information fusion",
    ", we should consider not only the truth - membership supported by the evidence but also the false - membership againsted by the evidence . that is beyond the scope of fuzzy sets and interval valued fuzzy sets . in 1986 , atanassov introduced the intuitionistic fuzzy sets  @xcite which is a generalization of fuzzy sets and provably equivalent to interval valued fuzzy sets .",
    "the intuitionistic fuzzy sets consider both truth - membership and false - membership .",
    "later on , intuitionistic fuzzy sets were extended to the interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets  @xcite . the interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy set uses a pair of intervals @xmath6 , \\mbox {   } 0 \\leq t^-   \\leq t^+ \\leq 1 $ ] and @xmath7 , \\mbox {   } 0 \\leq f^- \\leq f^+ \\leq 1 $ ] with @xmath8 to describe the degree of true belief and false belief .",
    "because of the restriction that @xmath8 , intuitionistic fuzzy sets and interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets can only handle incomplete information not the indeterminate information and inconsistent information which exists commonly in belief systems .",
    "for example , when we ask the opinion of an expert about certain statement , he or she may say that the possibility that the statement is true is between @xmath9 and @xmath10 and the statement is false is between @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the degree that he or she is not sure is between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . here is another example ,",
    "suppose there are 10 votees during a voting process . in time @xmath15 , three vote  yes \" , two vote  no \" and five are undecided , using neutrosophic notation , it can be expressed as @xmath16 . in time @xmath17 , three vote  yes \" , two vote  no \" , two give up and three are undecided , it then can be expressed as @xmath18 .",
    "that is beyond the scope of the intuitionistic fuzzy set .",
    "so , the notion of neutrosophic set is more general and overcomes the aforementioned issues .      in neutrosophic set , indeterminacy",
    "is quantified explicitly and + truth - membership , indeterminacy - membership and false - membership are independent .",
    "this assumption is very important in information fusion when we try to combine the data from different sensors .",
    "neutrosophy was introduced by florentin smarandache in 1980 .",
    " it is a branch of philosophy which studies the origin , nature and scope of neutralities , as well as their interactions with different ideational spectra \"  @xcite .",
    "neutrosophic set is a powerful general formal framework which generalizes the concept of the classic set , fuzzy set  @xcite , interval valued fuzzy set  @xcite , intuitionistic fuzzy set  @xcite , interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy set  @xcite , paraconsistent set  @xcite , dialetheist set  @xcite , paradoxist set  @xcite , tautological set  @xcite .",

    "@xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the real standard or non - standard subsets of @xmath230 ^ - , 1^+[$ ] .",
    "@xmath24 is the degree of true membership function in the set @xmath1 , @xmath25 is the degree of indeterminate membership function in the set @xmath1 and @xmath22 is the degree of false membership function in the set @xmath1 .",
    "the neutrosophic set generalizes the above mentioned sets from philosophical point of view . from scientific or engineering point of view , the neutrosophic set and set - theoretic operators need to be specified . otherwise , it will be difficult to apply in the real applications . in this paper",
    ", we define the set - theoretic operators on an instance of neutrosophic set called interval neutrosophic set ( ins ) .",
    "we call it as  interval \" because it is subclass of neutrosophic set , that is we only consider the subunitary interval of @xmath26 $ ] .",
