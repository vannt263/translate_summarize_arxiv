    "quantum metrology is a fast developing field of current research in both theoretical and experimental physics@xcite .",
    "it is aimed to explore the capabilities of quantum systems that , when employed as probes sensing physical parameters , allow to attain resolutions that are beyond the ability of classical protocols @xcite . according to the quantum estimation theory , the ultimate achievable precision in parameter estimation scenarios is characterized by the quantum cramr - rao inequality @xcite : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the number of measurement repetitions and @xmath2 is the qfi .",
    "namely , the ultimate precision is inversely proportional to the square root of qfi .",
    "phase estimation plays a central role in practical quantum metrology , such as optical interferometry @xcite and atomic spectroscopy @xcite , since most of tasks can be attributed to the problem of estimating the relative phase .",
    "unfortunately , any realistic quantum system inevitably couples to an uncontrollable environment which influences it in a non - negligible way @xcite",
    ". then the issue of robustness of quantum metrological protocols against various sources of decoherence has soon been raised @xcite , in particular , wondering whether such metrological schemes could be utilized not only to beat the standard quantum limit ( sql ) , but also to achieve the heisenberg limit ( hl ) @xcite . in this context , it is a pivotal task to preserve the precision scaling under the environmental noises .",
    "the feasibility of preservation is greatly dependent on the intrinsic properties of the environment coupled to the system . according to the scale of correlation times",
    ", environments can be grouped into markovian or non - markovian types . the former case possessing a small decoherence time during which correlations disappear , has been proven to be harmful to quantum metrology @xcite .",
    "even a very low noise level can completely destroy the superiority of quantum metrological protocols and turn hl into sql",
    ". however , non - markovian environments which characterized by long correlation times or structured spectral features would be more general in many physical situations @xcite .",
    "the research of non - markovian effects ( also known as memory effects ) is attracting extensive attentions due to key developments in the analysis , understanding , and even simulation of nontrivial system - environment effects @xcite . in a seminal work of chin _ et al _ @xcite",
    ", they first pointed that the non - markovian effects can guarantee the advantage of quantum metrological strategies in the presence of noise .",
    "this means non - markovianity may serve as a new resource for enhancing estimation tasks in open systems .",
    "the aforementioned discussions are restricted to consider the influence of non - markovian effects on the parameter estimation . however , to the best of our knowledge , few detailed investigations concerning the control of precision under environmental noises are available at present .    motivated by the above considerations , this study is to discuss the role of classical driving in the precise estimation of relative phase . to this end",
    ", the qfi is examined for a driven two - level system in a zero - temperature non - markovian reservoir .",
    "our results indicate that the precision can be drastically enhanced and even be completely preserved with the assistance of classical driving performed on the qubit .",
    "moreover , two factors for enhancing and preserving the precision are explored by comparing with the results in markovian case : the classical driving and the memory effect of non - markovian reservoir .",
    "the memory effect provides the feasibility of the enhancement while the classical driving provides a way to improve the precision .",
    "our results provide an active way to suppress decoherence and enhance the parameter - estimation precision , which is rather significant in quantum precision measurement and quantum metrology .",

    "in contrast , the behaviors of qfi are more complicated and interesting in the non - markovian regime . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , the qfi experiences damped oscillations in the absence of classical driving .",
    "the reason is that the qfi flows back and forth between the system and its non - markovian reservoir due to the memory effect ( a long correlation time of the reservoir ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is remarkable that in the non - markovian regime the classical driving plays an important role in the dynamics of qfi .",
    "we find the classical driving can dramatically protect the qfi from the influence of non - markovian noises and enhance the precision of parameter estimation .",
    "the stronger the classical driving is , the higher is the estimation precision .",
    "these results can be understood as follows . on the one hand , we know that the oscillations of the atomic inversion represent the exchanging of energy between the atom and the field .",
    "when the rabi frequency becomes larger , the energy exchange will become more rapid @xcite . on the other hand , when the rabi frequency increases , the effective coupling between the qubit and the reservoir decreases that suppresses the information exchange .",
    "therefore the outflow of the information from the qubit is suppressed , i.e. , the decay of qfi slows down . due to the memory effects , this phenomenon is more evidently in the non - markovian regime than markovian regime .",

    "the amplitude of the qfi increases with the decrease of the @xmath98 .",
    "this is because the smaller the value of @xmath98 , the stronger the non - markovian effects . and more information can be feed back to the system",
    ". then the precision of parameter estimation can be improved by the enhancement of the non - markovian effects . on the other hand ,",
    "if the strength of non - markovian effects is weak , for instance @xmath99 , then one can alternatively enhance the qfi by increasing the classical driving parameter @xmath32 .",
    "remarkably , the efficiency of qfi preservation approximates to 100% when @xmath100 in the non - markovian environments . while in the markovian regime ( @xmath101 ) , only a small amount of qfi could be preserved .",
    "these results indicate that the enhancement of qfi greatly benefits from the combination of classical driving and non - markovian effects .     and the strength of classical driving @xmath96 in non - markovian regime ( @xmath94 ) .",

    "@xmath82 as a function of dimensionless quantity @xmath103 and @xmath96 with @xmath91 is plotted in fig .",
    "it follows from the numerical analysis that the detuning @xmath104 has an adverse influence upon the precision of parameter estimation .",
    "this result is to be expected since the large detuning make the coupling between the qubit and the driving field weaker .",
    "fortunately , this negative influence can be suppressed by increasing the the strength of classical driving .",

    "( 2 ) this drastic enhancement occurs only when the conditions of the non - markovian effects and the classical driving are satisfied simultaneously .",
    "these results provide a good method to enhance the precision of phase estimation in open quantum systems and would be benefit for quantum metrology .",
    "in order to construct a more intuitive physical insight into the phenomenon of classical - driving - enhanced precision in non - markovian environment , we utilize the quasimode hamiltonian @xcite in the following analysis . for the hamiltonian described by eq .",

    "a noteworthy feature is that the basis states have been changed to @xmath120 when the atom coupled with the structured reservoir with the assistance of the classical driving . assuming the spectral function of the reservoir is still lorentzian , the corresponding quasimode hamiltonian can be given by @xmath121 with @xmath122,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the creation and annihilation operators of the continuum quasimode of frequency @xmath125 . @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the creation and annihilation operators of the discrete quasimode .     as a function of @xmath32 , @xmath104 and @xmath107 .",

    "the inset figure shows that negative @xmath107 first reduces the effective detuning @xmath128 in a small region and then increases it when @xmath109.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we shall first exploit the physical mechanism of the qfi dynamics without classical driving . from the quasimode hamiltonian , we find that the system only couples to a discrete quasimode , which interacts with a set of continuum quasimodes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) note that the coupling strength between the discrete quasimode and continuum quasimodes just depends on the width of the spectral density @xmath61 .",
    "the discrete quasimode functions as a memory between the system and the dissipative environment .",
    "the behavior of the new system composed by the qubit and the discrete quasimode is completely markovian @xcite . since the qubit interacts only with the discrete quasimode , while the dissipative process happens only in the interaction between the discrete mode and the continuum modes .",
    "therefore , in the markovian regime ( @xmath129 ) , the dynamics of qfi is dominated by the dissipative interaction @xmath130 , and the qfi decays exponentially and vanishes only asymptotically , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . whereas in the non - markovian regime @xmath131",
    ", the dissipative interaction is suppressed and the information could exchange back and forth between the system and discrete quasimode before it is completely dissipated into the continuum quasimodes .",
    "so the qfi vanishes with a damping of its revival amplitude in the non - markovian regime , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "next , we demonstrate how the classical driving affect the dynamics of qfi . in the quasimode hamiltonian ,",
    "the memory part is also a jaynes - cummings model , and the effective detuning between the qubit and discrete quasimode is @xmath132 where @xmath36 , @xmath133 and rabi frequency @xmath32 .",
    "it is well known that for the jaynes - cummings model , the larger the absolute value of detuning , the weaker coupling between the qubit and the mode of the field @xcite .",
    "then the information transfer between qubit and field slows down . with this conclusion in mind , the results in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] could be explained clearly via the effective detuning @xmath128 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) , @xmath128 is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath32 and positive @xmath107 , while it is a decreasing function of @xmath104 . therefore , increasing @xmath32 and positive @xmath107 can effectively enhance the precision of parameter estimation , whereas increasing @xmath104 reduces the precision .",
    "that is why increasing @xmath32 and positive @xmath107 are beneficial to the enhancement of precision , while increasing @xmath104 is harmful .",
    "however , due to the presence of classical driving , negative @xmath107 first reduces the effective detuning @xmath128 in a small region and then increases it when @xmath109 .",
    "the sudden change point @xmath134 , i.e. , @xmath135 , indicates that the enhancement of precision provided by classical driving has been completely neutralized by the negative @xmath107 .",
    "we should also note that if the total decoherence process is dominated by the dissipative part of the quasimode hamiltonian ( i.e. , in the markovian regime ) , the increasing of effective detuning @xmath128 just prolong the decay slightly .",
    "only when the dissipative channel is greatly suppressed ( i.e. , in the non - markovian regime ) , the increasing of effective detuning @xmath128 can drastically enhance the parameter - estimation precision .",
    "namely , the enhancement is based on the combination of large effective detuning between the system and the discrete quasimode and the strong non - markovian effects .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the parameter - estimation precision of a driven two - state system coupled to a bosonic environment at zero temperature .",
    "the precision is just slightly improved , and still decays asymptotically to zero in the markovian environment under the classical driving .",

    "we also find that increasing the rabi frequency or the degree of the non - markovian effects can make further improvement on the precision , while non - resonant driving will reduce the precision .",
    "moreover , we should emphasize that the drastic enhancement is based on the combination of classical driving and non - markovian effects .",
    "the above results provide an active method to combat the influence of decoherence on quantum metrology . finally , according to the quasimode theory ,",
