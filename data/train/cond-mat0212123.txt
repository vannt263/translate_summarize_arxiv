    "the high - temperature expansion can be used in any dimension and has provided significant information on variety of models.@xcite it is based on the taylor expansion of the boltzmann factor @xmath1 in @xmath2 , around the high - temperature limit . although the concept of the high - temperature expansion is quite simple , its high - order calculation requires sophisticated strategies . a standard method of the high - temperature expansion",

    "it has been used for a long time,@xcite and progress of the high - temperature series has been due mainly to improvement of computers . in the fcm , the series expansion is reduced to calculation in connected finite - size clusters",
    ". however , the fcm is inefficient for calculating a correlation function between rather distant sites : ( i ) the clusters have to include those two sites and calculation in such large clusters consumes a lot of time .",
    "( ii ) the fcm does not use a valuable piece of information .",
    "that is , the high - temperature series of a long - range correlation starts at a certain finite order , namely , low - order coefficients are equal to zero  physically , it means that a long - range correlation develops at low temperature .    in this paper , we formulate a new method oriented to the long - range correlation , namely , it overcome ( i ) and ( ii ) above .",

    "the corresponding quasi - cumulant enables us to calculate a number of terms higher than the lowest - order nonzero cumulant . in ref .  , the fourier transform of the correlation function is calculated using the new method and the fcm complementarily . that is , we have used the new method for the long - range correlations and the fcm for the short - range correlations .",
    "in addition , also for the specific heat , we have adopted a similar strategy in ref .  .",
    "that is , contributions from the required largest cluster are calculated by a new technique , and the fcm is used only for the smaller clusters .",
    "we utilize cumulants relevant to the ordering of quantum variables . by choosing nonzero cumulants from them , some of the series coefficients",
