    "the evolution of superbubbles created by the stellar winds and supernovae of ob associations is one of the primary processes that determines the structure and energetics of the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "all components of the diffuse interstellar medium , including warm and cold as well as the warm ionized medium ( wim ) , are thought to have large fractions of their volume consisting largely of superbubble walls ( heiles 1984 ; kennicutt 1995 ) .",
    "the restructuring of cool gas will in turn influence the collapse of molecular clouds and attendant star formation ( mccray & kafatos 1987 ) .",
    "likewise , the hot ionized medium ( him ) is believed to originate within these superbubbles and type ia supernova remnants ( snrs ) , hence the evolution of these structures determines whether and how this gas is released into the general ism .",
    "models for the ism are strongly dependent on whether the coronal gas is the pervasive , dominant component , as envisioned by mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) , or whether it plays a lesser role as favored by slavin & cox ( 1993 ) , returning to a paradigm closer to the two - phase ism of field , goldsmith , & habing ( 1969 ) .",
    "the standard model for understanding the evolution of superbubbles and other shell structures is that of an adiabatic , pressure - driven bubble , with continuous wind energy injection ( weaver 1977 ; dyson 1977 ; pikelner 1968 ) .",
    "it has generally been assumed that in later stages , successive supernovae ( sne ) can be treated as an approximate continuous energy injection , and are able to power the growth of supergiant shells ( mac low & mccray 1988 ) .",
    "such supergiant shells , having radii of hundreds of pc , could then blow out of the galactic disk , releasing hot gas into the halo , possibly in a galactic fountain cycle .",
    "however , recent evidence suggests that superbubble evolution is often not as simple as described by the standard model .",
    "many superbubbles exhibit expansion velocities that are too high to be consistent with the standard evolution , and a correlation of bright x - ray emission with many of these objects suggests acceleration by snr impacts ( oey 1996 ) . in such cases ,",
    "not all the available sn energy will be thermalized to power the shell expansion , thus the detailed effect that discrete sne have on the long - term shell evolution remains unclear .",
    "likewise , there is evidence that the growth rate of the shells may be overestimated , perhaps owing to an overestimate in input wind power predicted by assumed stellar mass - loss rates ( oey 1996 ; garca - segura & mac low 1995 ; drissen 1995 ) .",
    "therefore much remains unclear about the details of superbubble evolution .",
    "a demonstrative example is the superbubble dem 152 ( n44 ) in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "_ rosat _ observations of this object clearly show hot gas escaping through a `` blowout '' feature ( magnier 1996 ) , and this object also exhibits kinematics discrepant from the standard model ( oey & massey 1995 ) . if the ism has low - density channels that encroach upon the superbubble environment , such evolutionary disruptions could signal a significant release of hot gas into the surroundings , and not necessarily out of the plane of galactic disks .",
    "the details of superbubble evolution thus have a direct consequence for the relative volumes of coronal gas in galactic disks and halos .",
    "examples such as dem 152 demonstrate the uncertainties in our understanding of superbubble evolution , and the importance to the global ism .",
    "one approach to test the assumed evolution is an examination of the superbubble size distribution in galaxies .",
    "this can be predicted from the evolutionary model in combination with a given production rate and mechanical luminosity function .",
    "a subsequent comparison with observed size distributions can then yield insight on the evolutionary assumptions and possible consequences for the inferred structure of the ism .",
    "the cumulative size distribution of radiative snrs has long been used as a diagnostic of sn parameters ( hughes , helfand , & kahn 1984 ) , but it can also be used to test evolutionary models for snrs and superbubbles .",
    "an earlier investigation with a foray into this technique was carried out for snrs by cioffi & shull ( 1991 ) , who pointed out that the differential size distribution is a much more powerful diagnostic than the cumulative size distribution . in this work ,",
    "we present a prediction for the differential size distribution for superbubbles and compare the results with observations of nearby galaxies .",
    "we will then examine the results with regard to the structure and porosity of the ism .",
    "we will consider a rather rudimentary model for superbubble evolution , with the aim of identifying dominant effects , rather than precisely reproducing observations .",
    "for example , the size distribution of sedov - taylor snrs is predicted to increase as @xmath21 ( hughes 1984 ) , for uniform ism and stellar properties , whereas hole distributions in galaxies all show size distributions that decrease with shell radius @xmath22 .",
    "our objective is to derive gross general properties that would be expected as a result of the simplest practical application of the standard model .",
    "agreements and disagreements with observations will then be instructive in understanding the features of the model that dominate the resultant size distribution and shell evolution , with attendant consequences for the structure of the ism .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we work out general expressions for the assumed shell evolution and derived size distributions , for three combinations of shell creation and mechanical power input : ( a ) continuous creation , single luminosity ; ( b ) single burst , luminosity spectrum ; and ( c ) continuous creation , luminosity spectrum . in  3 ,",
    "we evaluate each of the solutions for the standard , adiabatic shell evolution .",
    "we also briefly examine the standard , momentum - conserving evolution . to obtain the slope of the mechanical luminosity spectrum",
    ", we examine evolutionary effects in the  region luminosity function in  4 . in  5 , we compare our predictions with observations in four nearby galaxies , with attention to the slope , normalization , and peak of the size distributions .",
    "we also estimate supernova rates based on our analysis .",
    "the consequences are discussed in  6 , where we examine the regimes of applicability for our predictions . here",
    "we discuss the role of processes likely to modify the size distributions , and the role of alternate shell creation mechanisms .",
    "these effects are likely to be dependent on galaxy type .",
    "we also derive expressions for the ism porosities resulting from our analysis , and compute porosities for the four nearby galaxies and the milky way .",
    "our results are summarized in  7 .",
    "superbubble expansion is presumed to be powered by the stellar winds , and especially , sne of the parent ob association .",
    "it has been customary to represent the sn power as a continuous energy injection analogous to a wind ( mac low & mccray 1988 ) , in which over half the sn energy is thermalized to drive the shell expansion .",
    "we will adopt this standard , adiabatic representation ( e.g. , weaver 1977 ; dyson 1977 ) .",
    "for the purpose of comparing with  `` hole '' data and ism porosities , we are particularly interested in the superbubble cavity , which in this thin - shell approximation is considered to evolve identically to the outer radius .",
    "we also assume that the mechanical luminosity @xmath23 , dominated by the sne , remains constant as a function of time @xmath13 . as shown by shull & saken ( 1995 ) , this is a reasonable approximation for realistic slopes of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "this constant @xmath23 is then assumed to continue until the lowest - mass sn progenitors expire at @xmath24 , which corresponds to a stellar mass of about 8@xmath25 , or a period of roughly @xmath26 myr .",
    "a variation in input power may occur in the initial stages ( @xmath27 myr ) while @xmath28 is dominated by the stellar wind phase ( shull & saken 1995 ) , but this stage is short relative to @xmath29 , the total period of energy input .",
    "leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) and ferrire ( 1995 ) show that a starburst over this period does not substantially alter this approximation .",
    "a uniform ambient medium is assumed throughout , although in  6 we will discuss effects expected from disk galaxy gas distributions .    as will become apparent below",
    ", the endstage of shell evolution is vitally important to this analysis , but is fraught with uncertainties .",
    "we will consider the following simple model , keeping in mind our motivation of testing the simplest - case standard evolution .",
    "in most cases , eventually the superbubbles internal pressure @xmath30 the ambient pressure of the interstellar medium , while still at ages @xmath31 . we will consider that for such objects , the superbubble growth stalls when @xmath32 . at this stage ,",
    "radiative losses are thought to become important , confining the shell growth .",
    "simulations by garca - segura & franco ( 1996 ) , for example , show that the growth of the cavity radius does stall at times close to the sonic point .",
    "we will assume that the superbubbles survive at the stall radius @xmath33 until the input power stops at time @xmath29 . in principle",
    ", the shells will begin to disintegrate , owing to ambient random motions .",
    "however , the disintegration timescale may be fairly long ; for example , it is @xmath3410 myr for ambient rms velocity @xmath35 and @xmath36 pc .",
    "furthermore , the process of disintegration will still leave detectable cavities , so it is unclear how this effect can be quantified .",
    "we note that if the breakup of objects into smaller subunits occurs such that the ratio of subunit sizes is universal for all objects , then a power law size distribution remains unaffected ( clarke 1996 ) .",
    "our analysis will therefore not consider elimination of shells at ages @xmath37 , nor differential elimination among the shell population .",
    "finally , an important feature regarding stalling is the existence of a monotonic correspondence between @xmath28 and @xmath33 , for a uniform ism .",
    "objects that never achieve pressure equilibrium with the ism are simply assumed to grow until @xmath29 .",
    "finally , all objects are assumed to survive for an additional nominal period @xmath38 , which is the same for all shells .    within individual clusters ,",
    "we take the star formation to occur in a single , instantaneous burst .",
    "massey ( 1995a , b ) find that in general the duration of star formation is @xmath39 myr for associations in the magellanic clouds and the galaxy , which again is short relative to @xmath29 .",
    "the spectrum of associated mechanical luminosities is a critical parameter ; we will consider both a single , global value for @xmath28 , and a power - law luminosity function ( lf ) : @xmath40 normalized such that @xmath41 . in ",
    "4 we will discuss the form of @xmath42 , and in particular , the value of @xmath12 ; our analysis of @xmath42 will assume the stellar imf to be constant .",
    "we will also consider a constant cluster formation rate @xmath43 , and an instantaneous burst of cluster formation .",
    "we first present the general expressions for the superbubble size distribution in the case that the shells grow according to the generic law : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the radius at which a superbubble stalls , which is dependent only on the input @xmath28 , for uniform ism parameters .",
    "we now consider the production of superbubbles for the simple cases of luminosity distribution @xmath42 and formation rate @xmath43 mentioned above , with respect to the stalling and continuous - growth evolutionary schemes . in each case",
    ", we derive @xmath0 , defined such that the number of superbubbles with radii in the range @xmath22 to @xmath46 is @xmath47 .",
    "if superbubbles are generated at a constant rate @xmath48 , then the number of growing shells with radii in the range @xmath22 to @xmath46 is equal to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the time interval for creation corresponding to this radial range .",
    "thus , the differential size distribution is , @xmath51 [ note that partial derivatives with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath28 are evaluated at constant @xmath28 and @xmath13 respectively . ]    recalling the correspondence between @xmath28 and stall radius @xmath33 , the single - valued @xmath52 will therefore yield a single - valued @xmath53 for stalled objects : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the age at which a shell powered by @xmath56 stalls .      if @xmath57 superbubbles are created in an instantaneous burst , then after time @xmath13 , the number of growing objects with radii in the range @xmath22 to @xmath46 is equal to @xmath58 , where @xmath28 and @xmath59 are the luminosity and range corresponding to this interval in @xmath22 .",
    "thus , @xmath60    similarly , the distribution of stalled shells is given by : @xmath61        the form of @xmath0 in this case can be obtained from the generalisation of either equation  [ cc1l.grow ] or  [ sbls.grow ] . in the former case ,",
    "@xmath0 is obtained by integrating equation  [ cc1l.grow ] over the luminosity distribution : @xmath62 whilst in the latter case @xmath0 is obtained by integrating equation  [ sbls.grow ] over a continuous creation rate : @xmath63    equations  [ ccls.growl ] and [ ccls.growt ] are equivalent in this situation , provided the limits of integration are correctly chosen .",
    "note that these limits are functions of @xmath22 , determined by the limiting conditions required to produce a given @xmath22 . for a luminosity distribution truncated at @xmath64 and @xmath65 ,",
    "the lower limit of integration for equation  [ ccls.growl ] is @xmath66 here , @xmath67 represents the luminosity for which the shell attains the given radius @xmath22 within the maximum allowable time , @xmath29 , whereas @xmath68 is the luminosity such that a shell of luminosity @xmath69 stalls at @xmath22 , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "likewise , the upper limit of integration is @xmath71 representing the luminosity of the youngest shells that have grown to radius @xmath22 .",
    "in the same vein , the lower limit of integration for equation  [ ccls.growt ] is @xmath72 implying that no shells contribute to @xmath0 if they were formed so recently that even the most luminous have not yet grown to @xmath22 .",
    "likewise , the upper limit is @xmath73 for the case of continuous growth with no possibility of stalling , the most distant epoch contributing to @xmath0 is determined only by @xmath64 .",
    "thus in that case @xmath74 , as long as this is shorter than @xmath29 .",
    "if , however , the possibility of stalling is included , then the contribution from growing shells is additionally limited to periods shorter than @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the age at which a shell stalls at radius @xmath22 ( see equation  [ generic ] ) .      by analogy to equation  [ ccls.growt ] , the stalled shells are described by , @xmath77 with @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .      in this section , we also include the possibility of a survival phase (  2.1 ) beyond @xmath29 , of duration @xmath81 . for shells stalling at @xmath82 : @xmath83 while for those that continue growing until @xmath29 , therefore having @xmath84 : @xmath85 these yield , @xmath86 and @xmath87      the complete shell evolution is summarized by @xmath88    as mentioned above , any given @xmath28 uniquely determines corresponding stall parameters @xmath45 and @xmath89 applying this relation to @xmath29 , we denote the stall parameters corresponding to @xmath29 as @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in other words , a superbubble with input power @xmath91 would just stall at radius @xmath90 and age @xmath29 . since the input power ceases at this time , @xmath29 is the maximum possible stalling age .",
    "thus shells larger than @xmath90 are all either growing or in the survival stage , because their @xmath84 .",
    "conversely , the population of shells smaller than @xmath90 contains a combination of growing , stalled , and surviving objects .",
    "therefore , for @xmath92 , the total distribution is given by , @xmath93 for the case @xmath94 and @xmath95 , the contribution to @xmath0 from growing superbubbles is given by equation  [ ccls.growt ] : @xmath96 whilst the contribution from stalled systems is given by equation  [ ccls.stall ] : @xmath97 the distribution for surviving shells , @xmath98 , is given by equation  [ ccls.sur.stall ] .",
    "for @xmath99 , the total size distribution is , @xmath100 for the contribution due to growing superbubbles , equation  [ ccls.growt ] is now written : @xmath101 again for @xmath94 and @xmath102 .",
    "likewise , the shells in the survival phase are , by assumption , preserved at their instantaneous radii at time @xmath29 , so that @xmath103 is given by equation  [ ccls.sur.grow ] .",
    "we now incorporate the standard evolution for adiabatic , pressure - driven superbubbles to the expressions developed above . the growth of the shell radius is described by ( weaver 1977 ) : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the mass density of a uniform ambient medium , and all units are cgs .",
    "the corresponding evolution of the interior pressure is @xmath106 in what follows , it is convenient to use @xmath107 and @xmath91 as scaling parameters , recalling that @xmath90 and @xmath91 correspond to the stall criterion at the characteristic time @xmath29 . equations  [ rcgs ] and [ picgs ] can now be written , @xmath108 @xmath109    as discussed previously , we consider that the shell growth stalls when @xmath110 the ambient pressure .",
    "this condition therefore implies a stall age : @xmath111 thus , by equation  [ r2 ] , @xmath112 equations [ tfl ] and [ rf ] demonstrate the correspondence between stalling age @xmath76 and radius @xmath33 for a given input power @xmath28 .",
    "the corresponding relation between @xmath76 and @xmath33 is , @xmath113 thus the final age @xmath76 is directly proportional to the final radius @xmath33 .    for a given @xmath29 ,",
    "equations  [ rcgs ] and [ picgs ] give : @xmath114 @xmath115 in cgs units , where @xmath116 is the number density of the uniform ambient medium and @xmath117 is the mean particle weight . note that equations  [ re ] and [ le ] are applicable in general for the relation between @xmath33 , @xmath76 , and @xmath69 as well . for ism parameters @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , the characteristic time @xmath26 myr implies @xmath120 pc and @xmath121 .",
    "as described in  2.2 , the growing shells are the interesting case here , for which equations  [ cc1l.grow ] and [ r2 ] imply , @xmath122 thus for a single - valued lf of luminosity @xmath56 , the size distribution is an increasing function of @xmath123 , which results from the slower growth of large shells . as the stalled shells accumulate , they also superimpose a @xmath124-function at @xmath125 , described by equation  [ cc1l.stall ] .      here",
    "we assume that @xmath42 is a power law as given by equation  [ mlf ] . for the growing shells with age @xmath126 , equations  [ sbls.grow ] and [ r2 ] yield , @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the fraction of @xmath57 corresponding to growing shells .",
    "the fraction of stalled shells is given by , @xmath129 where @xmath28 is the luminosity corresponding to the largest stalled shells .",
    "as we shall see in  5 , realistic values of the lf index fall in the range @xmath130 , for which @xmath131 would be an inverse power law in @xmath22 .",
    "this results from the larger fraction of small , weak-@xmath28 shells .",
    "the stalled shells are described by equation  [ sbls.stall ] .",
    "together with equation  [ rf ] , this gives , @xmath132    the total size distribution at times before all the objects have stalled and @xmath3 would be the sum of equations  [ e.sbls.grow ] and [ e.sbls.stall ] .",
    "owing to the large numbers of weak-@xmath28 objects , equation  [ e.sbls.stall ] will normally dominate @xmath0 in relative numbers . however , these stalled shells will only be present out to radius @xmath133 corresponding to the age @xmath134 of the burst . at this radius",
    ", there will be a discontinuous jump by a factor of @xmath135 , resulting from the different coefficients of @xmath136 ( cf .",
    "equation  [ r2 ] ) and @xmath137 ( cf .",
    "equation  [ rf ] ) .",
    "the subset of objects with @xmath5 will not stall in @xmath126 and will therefore follow the relation given by equation  [ e.sbls.grow ] .",
    "we shall now evaluate the expressions in  2.4.4 , for the population of shells with radii @xmath3 , incorporating @xmath42 as given by equation  [ mlf ] . for @xmath138 and @xmath139 the size distribution for the growing shells is given by equation  [ grow < ] . with the aid of equation  [ r2 ] this yields , @xmath140 for each @xmath22 we are summing over all ages up to @xmath76 that yield a stall radius @xmath22 , so that ( from equation  [ tfrf ] ) equation  [ e.grow<.>b ] becomes , @xmath141    in the case that @xmath142 , equation  [ ccls.growt ] is dominated by @xmath143 ( equation  [ tl ] ) , and if @xmath144 , then @xmath74 . for both of these cases",
    ", @xmath145 thus for @xmath146 , the slope of the size distribution turns over from @xmath147 in equation  [ e.grow<.>b ] to a positive slope of @xmath148 , at @xmath149 , where @xmath150 corresponds to the case in the absence of stalling . beware that the resulting peak in @xmath151 does not correspond to the maximum peak in the total @xmath0 , since the latter is dominated by stalled shells , as we shall see below .    for",
    "the stalled shells , equations  [ stall < ] and [ rf ] yield , @xmath152 note that for these stalled objects , the term @xmath153 by equation  [ tfrf ] . this therefore represents the fraction of their lifetime @xmath29 that is spent in the stalled state , for shells of radius @xmath22 . although multiplying out equation  [ e.stall < ] yields two terms with dependences @xmath154 and @xmath155 is dominated by @xmath154 since we are in the regime @xmath156 .",

    "the criterion @xmath5 corresponds to @xmath168 , which may provide a convenient defining criterion for these larger - scale phenomena , for example , starburst events .",
    "there might possibly be applications for equation  [ total > ] for a large sample of starburst phenomena with uniform properties .    in the case that @xmath169 , equation  [ ccls.growt ] is dominated by the lower limit @xmath143 , as in the regime for @xmath3 .",

    "the dependence @xmath2 appears to be a fairly robust description , since stalled superbubbles quickly dominate most situations for both constant and instantaneous superbubble formation . in addition , we also mentioned above that the slope will not change if the breakup of shells into subunits is independent of the original size ( clarke 1996 ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath154 dependence turns out not to be unique to the standard evolution .",
    "consider the general relation , @xmath173 within factors of unity , the stalling criterion is equivalent to setting the shell ram pressure @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the shell density and @xmath176 is the shell expansion velocity .",

    "with equation  [ rgen ] , we then have , @xmath182 analagous to equation  [ tfrf ] .",

    "other values of @xmath187 and @xmath188 yielding @xmath189 will also produce equations  [ tfl ]  [ tfrf ] , and therefore our previous expressions for @xmath190 ( equation  [ e.stall < ] ) and @xmath98 ( equation  [ e.ccls.sur.stall ] ) would still be valid .",
    "it turns out that the non - adiabatic , momentum - conserving shell evolution described by steigman , strittmatter , & williams ( 1975 ) fulfills this condition .",
    "the momentum - conserving growth is given by , @xmath191 therefore , the only component of @xmath0 that differs from the adiabatic case is that for @xmath151 , for which equations  [ grow < ] and [ rmc ] give : @xmath192 in contrast to equation  [ e.grow<.b > ] .",

    "to check whether typical observed superbubbles are still in the regime @xmath3 for this case , we need to compute the new value of @xmath90 , again for @xmath26 myr .",
    "the unscaled relations for the radius and interior pressure are : @xmath195 @xmath196 where @xmath197 and @xmath198 are the mass - loss rate and velocity of the `` wind , '' thereby giving @xmath199 .",
    "the pressure equilibrium stalling criterion now yields , @xmath200 the dependences are the same as equation  [ re ] , but with a coefficent of @xmath201 in the momentum - conserving case versus @xmath202 in the adiabatic case .",
    "thus , for a given stall age @xmath76 , the corresponding stall radius of a momentum - conserving superbubble will be larger than that of an adiabatic superbubble .",
    "this results from the fact that the same value of @xmath76 corresponds to a larger value of @xmath28 in the momentum - conserving case because more energy is needed to maintain growth during the entire period @xmath76 .",
    "therefore the final stall radius @xmath33 for the momentum - conserving evolution is larger than the adiabatic case for a given @xmath76 .",
    "for the same default ism parameters as the adiabatic case , equation  [ remc ] yields @xmath203 pc .",
    "most observed superbubbles in galaxies indeed have radii smaller than this value .",
    "the form @xmath2 is therefore a fairly robust result for this simple representation of superbubble evolution .",
    "we must now consider the form of @xmath42 , the mechanical lf ( mlf ; equation  [ mlf ] ) , with regard to its slope @xmath12 and the upper and lower limits .",
    "the mlf results from the stellar census present in the ob associations , which in turn manifests its presence through the  region lf (  lf ) . as recognized by heiles ( 1990 ) , the mlf and  lf are closely linked .",
    "we will focus on clusters that are sufficiently rich so that statistical fluctuations in stellar membership have a negligible effect on the mean  luminosity per star .",
    "we term such clusters `` saturated , '' and consider this limit for now , deferring a discussion of smaller , `` unsaturated '' clusters until  4.3 .    for the saturated clusters , the total initial   luminosity @xmath204 , and the mechanical luminosity @xmath28 , are both proportional to the total number of stars in the cluster , thus implying @xmath205 . therefore , the slope of the mlf is equal to that of the  lf .",
    "this is not , however , necessarily the same as the slope of the _ observed _  lf ( von hippel and bothun 1990 ) , because the  region luminosity fades with time as the ionizing stars expire , and the observed  lf contains objects of differing ages .",
    "therefore , before we simply take the empirical slope of the  lf as that of the mlf , we must first consider the possible effect of evolution on the  lf .",
    "we will now examine this effect analytically .",
    "we characterise the evolution of the  region luminosity by @xmath206 where @xmath207 .",
    "we thus assume that the fractional fading in a given time , and hence the imf , is the same for all clusters .",
    "since the observed  lfs are well described as power laws ( kennicutt , edgar , & hodge 1989 ) , we will presume the initial lf to have the same form : @xmath208 we adopt the index @xmath12 as in the previous sections , because as argued above , we assume that @xmath42 has the same exponent as @xmath209 . as with @xmath42 ( equation  [ mlf ] ) , @xmath210 is defined such that @xmath211 is the fraction of objects with luminosities in the range @xmath212 to @xmath213 .",
    "if the magnitude of @xmath214 is large at early times , we would expect the steady - state observed  lf to be steeper than the initial , since the brightest objects are quickly diminished . on the other hand , if @xmath215 evolves strongly at late times , then the initial slope @xmath12 is largely preserved .",
    "the evolution of @xmath210 may be considered analogous to that of @xmath0 ( equation  [ ccls.growl ] ) above : @xmath216 where @xmath48 is the constant cluster formation rate as before and the partial derivative with respect to @xmath13 is evaluated at constant @xmath212 .",
    "the observed  lf is determined by the contribution of objects at all ages to a given luminosity bin , and these therefore fall in the range @xmath217 . from equation  [ f ] , @xmath218 so in general , @xmath219 where @xmath215 and @xmath214 are functions of @xmath212 and @xmath204 as described by equation  [ f ] .",
    "the upper limit of integration is determined by the upper limit to the initial  lf , @xmath220 . for a power law lf given by equation  [ hlf ] : @xmath221",
    "we now consider the form of @xmath222 .",
    "this depends on the stellar mass ( @xmath223 ) vs. main - sequence lifetime ( @xmath224 ) relation , as well as the relative contributions to total @xmath212 from stars of different masses .",
    "leitherer ( 1990 , figure  8) shows that fortuitously , for a standard salpeter ( 1955 ) imf , the contribution to @xmath212 from each unit mass bin @xmath225 , is approximately constant for all @xmath226 , while for lower - mass stars it plummets steeply .    as an exploratory case",
    ", we therefore make the approximation that only stars with @xmath227 contribute to @xmath212 , and that the different masses contribute equally .",
    "we represent the @xmath228 relation for @xmath227 as a power law : @xmath229 the geneva stellar evolutionary models ( schaerer 1993 ; maeder 1990 ; maeder & meynet 1988 ) show that this relation actually increases somewhat faster than a simple power law , but for our purposes , the approximation is adequate .",
    "fits to their models , which are the same as those used in leitherer s ( 1990 ) study , yield @xmath230 in the range @xmath231 .",
    "if we furthermore assume that stars in each mass bin contribute a constant luminosity for the duration of their main sequence lifetimes and nothing thereafter , we then obtain the fading function , @xmath232 where @xmath233 , and @xmath234 is the time at which the @xmath212 fading begins , which is @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the upper - mass limit of the imf .",
    "applying equation  [ cathie.f ] to equation  [ evol.gen ] , we obtain : @xmath237^{d+1}}\\ df\\ + t_i \\biggr ] \\quad , \\ ] ] using @xmath238 to denote the slope of the observed  lf , @xmath239 .",
    "the last term in equation  [ cathie.phi ] corresponds to shells with ages @xmath240 , for which equation  [ evol.gen ] diverges .",
    "equation  [ cathie.phi ] demonstrates that for @xmath241 , the integral is always dominated by its upper limit , so that ageing does not affect the form of the  lf in this case . for @xmath242 , if @xmath243 is sufficiently large , then @xmath210 will asymptotically approach a slope of @xmath244 .",
    "values for the observed slope are found to be @xmath245 ( kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "figure  [ f.cathie.phi ] shows the resultant @xmath210 from equation  [ cathie.phi ] , numerically integrated for initial slopes @xmath12 ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 , with @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath248 .",
    "the curves are normalized to the same upper value to facilitate comparison .",
    "each curve is labeled with the input value of @xmath12 , which is within 4% of the resultant slope @xmath238 , fitted over the region @xmath249 .",
    "thus it is apparent that evolution has essentially no effect on these slopes for @xmath250 . with the dashed line",
    ", we also show the result for @xmath251 , @xmath252 and @xmath253 ; this model confirms that the observed slope does tend to the asymptotic limit of @xmath254 if @xmath236 is sufficiently large , although this effect is clearly negligible for realistic situations .",
    "alternatively , we can estimate @xmath222 directly from the population synthesis work of leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) .",
    "figure  37 of that work shows the evolution of the total ionizing photon emission rate @xmath255 , and hence @xmath212 , for clusters with different imfs and @xmath236 .",
    "the fading function is relatively insensitive to these variables and is well approximated by a power law decrease with time , which does not drop to zero at @xmath256 , but persists with the same power law at late times . from the leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) standard model with a salpeter imf of slope 2.35 and @xmath257 , we fit a fading function slope @xmath258 in the regime @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "this slope was also found by beltrametti ( 1982 ) .",
    "we thus parameterize the evolution as : @xmath261 so that integration of equation  [ evol.gen ] yields : @xmath262\\ + \\ \\psi t_i a_0\\ { \\lha}^{-\\beta}\\quad .\\ ] ] this again implies that the slope of @xmath210 remains unaffected by ageing for @xmath263 , whereas if @xmath264 , ageing produces an observed slope @xmath265 , independent of @xmath266 and @xmath236 .",
    "this minimum value of @xmath238 reflects our argument above , that the observed slope of @xmath210 is steepened if the nebular luminosity evolution is strong enough .",
    "figure  [ f.lh95.phi ] demonstrates this behavior for @xmath267 and a range of @xmath12 , with the curves again normalized to the same value of @xmath220 .",
    "thus if the slope of @xmath209 is steep , intrinsically luminous systems are rare and therefore the faded remnants of such objects make a relatively small contribution to any bin of observed @xmath212 .",
    "note that this steepening behavior in @xmath238 was not apparent , for plausible values of @xmath236 , in the case where @xmath222 was set to 0 at time @xmath268 ( equation  [ cathie.f ] ) . in that case ,",
    "the dynamic range of the fading function @xmath222 is small over most of the lifetime of an region .",
    "the stronger evolutionary effect resulting from equation  [ lh95.phi ] stems from the prolonged fading at late times in this prescription .",
    "note that @xmath269 essentially corresponds to @xmath270 in the previous case .",
    "recalling that @xmath271 is the power law slope for the @xmath272 relation ( equation  [ mtms ] ) , a value of @xmath273 suggests @xmath274 .",
    "this is considerably shallower than our previous estimate of 0.65 , which was fitted from the model results of the geneva group ( maeder 1990 ) , the same stellar models used by leitherer & heckman ( 1995 ) .",
    "this would suggest that the luminosity evolution of the  regions is affected by additional factors besides the turnoff of stars from the main - sequence , for example , spectral evolution of the stars while they are still in the h - burning phase .",
    "clearer understanding of the behavior of @xmath222 is needed to confirm the applicability of our analysis .",
    "we have shown how in principle ageing can cause the measured  lf to be steeper than the initial , as cluster fading shifts an excess of objects into low luminosity bins .",
    "this effect is only manifest for flatter initial @xmath209 with low @xmath12 , where any bin of objects at given current luminosity @xmath212 contains an important contribution from initially luminous objects formed in the distant past .",
    "thus for that case , it is the fading function @xmath222 that determines the observed  lf .",
    "conversely , if the initial @xmath209 is steep , then any bin of current luminosity is dominated by recently formed objects . in this case",
    ", ageing is unimportant , and the observed @xmath210 has the same slope as the initial .",
    "quantitatively , if the nebula fades according to a simple power law @xmath275 , then @xmath276 thus for example , if @xmath277 , then measured values of @xmath278 would imply only that @xmath279 .",
    "hence , for any simple power - law @xmath222 that does not steepen substantially at late times , there is a minimum value @xmath18 , independent of @xmath12 , given by equation  [ a ] .",
    "therefore , if different galaxies have populations of  regions characterised by different values of @xmath12 , then this variety would be manifest only down to a limiting value set by the @xmath222 .",
    "an observed value of @xmath280 can therefore be used to determine the actual slope @xmath269 of the fading function .",
    "for example , @xmath281 would imply an adjustment in the value of @xmath269 from 5 to 2.5 , which would require a much more gradual decline in  luminosity for the  regions than is predicted by the stellar models .",
    "however , @xmath269 is extremely sensitive to the adopted value of @xmath15 , so this test is unlikely to be practical in the near future .",
    "furthermore , our ability to observe @xmath18 depends on the actual existence of galaxies with  lfs having initial @xmath282 . at present",
    "the available data on  lfs in different galaxies suggests @xmath283 ( banfi 1993 ) , but there are not yet enough data to evaluate whether there is a lower cutoff in the values of @xmath238 .",
    "this is evidently an effect that can be sought in the future as  lfs become available for a larger sample of galaxies .",
    "we find , however , that this evolutionary effect of a minimum @xmath238 is unlikely to be significant for observed  lfs with spectral indices of @xmath284 , if we use @xmath222 based on plausible population synthesis arguments .",
    "we have experimented with two prescriptions : one assuming an instantaneous cutoff in @xmath212 at @xmath285 ; and the other using continuous fading , @xmath286 , based on population synthesis models by leitherer and heckman ( 1995 ) . in each case , the power - law fading is too steep for the measured values of @xmath238 to be explicable as an ageing effect , and thus we would conclude that @xmath238 is a direct measure of @xmath12 .",
    "we caution , however , that this result does depend on the assumed imf and modeled stellar parameters that are used in the population synthesis models .",
    "some of these parameters , for example , stellar ionizing fluxes ( especially those contributed by b stars ) , are rather poorly known .",
    "furthermore , this determination of @xmath12 from @xmath238 is based on stars with @xmath287 , which is the population ionizing the regions .",
    "we are thereby assuming that the slope @xmath12 extends to lower - mass stars , which dominate the mlf through their sne .",
    "this is based on assumptions about the form of the imf , and also the constancy of sn power for stars of different mass .      in the limit of small cluster membership number @xmath288 ,",
    "there is a wide dispersion in average  contribution per star , according to the precise stellar membership of the cluster . as a result ,",
    "a power law slope in the imf produces a @xmath209 of the same initial slope at high @xmath204 , but which flattens at low @xmath204 ( mckee & williams 1996 ) .",
    "this is produced by the behavior of the scatter , due to small number statistics , in contributions to @xmath204 from a bin of given @xmath288 .",
    "these contributions scatter symmetrically on a linear scale of @xmath204 , but logarithmically , they have a larger displacement to smaller values of @xmath289 , producing a consequent flattening of the luminosity spectrum . monte carlo simulations by mckee & williams ( 1996 ) confirm that this flattening occurs at @xmath290 , the  luminosity due to a single star of @xmath291 . clusters with @xmath292 are not rich enough to saturate the imf up to this maximum , and thus have varying mean  contribution per star ; whereas those with @xmath293 , again for a constant imf , will have @xmath294 , and thereby a constant  contribution per star . note that we do not expect a similar turnover in the mlf because the relative contribution to @xmath28 of each star is dominated by the sn power , which we assume to be independent of @xmath223 .",
    "the correspondence between @xmath238 and @xmath12 therefore applies in the regime where both @xmath204 and @xmath28 scale with the number of stars in the associations .    for some galaxies , the slope of the  lf shows a turnover to a shallower value at lower @xmath212 ( kennicutt 1989 ) , which could possibly be due to this effect , with objects falling below cluster saturation .",
    "the value of @xmath295 , corresponding to the saturation turnover , is currently estimated at @xmath296 ( vacca 1996 ; panagia 1973 ) .",
    "if the observed flattening of the lfs is caused by this effect , it is important to use the slope @xmath238 derived from the upper end of the  lf in estimating @xmath12 .",
    "however , although the observed value of @xmath238 might cause an underestimate of @xmath12 when fitted over the entire range of @xmath212 , we will see below that , where the measured @xmath0 is discrepant from that predicted , it requires _ shallower _ slopes in the mlf than those inferred from the  lf .",
    "we can now compare the prediction with observations for individual galaxies that have been mapped in  at sufficient resolution , and that have measured  lfs .",
    "table  [ observed ] lists observed parameters for nearby galaxies that we have examined .",
    "values for the observed slope @xmath238 of the  lf , fitted from data in the listed reference , are given in table  [ observed ] , along with the total number of detected   regions @xmath297 having @xmath298 , and total number of detected  holes @xmath299 .",
    "the limiting @xmath212 is that at which the surveys are complete for all the galaxies .",
    "we assume that all the  holes correspond to superbubbles .",
    "table  [ observed ] also lists the assumed  scale height @xmath300 , and reference for the  mapping .    [ cols=\"<,^,>,^,>,^,^ \" , ]     for m31 and m33 , we take @xmath8 to be the relevant porosity parameter , and for the smc , @xmath9 .",
    "the values in table  [ q ] of the relevant porosity parameters for these galaxies are all significantly less than 1 .",
    "we therefore do not expect a great deal of superbubble overlap and merging in these galaxies , thereby limiting the extent and networking of the hot gas that originates within the shells . on the other hand , the predicted porosity parameters for holmberg  ii are @xmath20 .",
    "this galaxy has a very large scale height , so both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are relevant , as is indicated by their similar values .",
    "these predict that holmberg  ii , unlike the other galaxies , does have an ism that is dominated by coronal gas .",
    "this supports the expectation that the importance of the him depends on the level of star formation relative to galaxy size and interstellar conditions .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , as seen in  5.2 , the normalizations of @xmath0 are uncertain , and these affect the derived porosity parameters , as does the assumption of a distribution extending to @xmath90 .",
    "however , given the general consistency with the sn rates , and possible overestimate of the @xmath301 conversion factor , we imagine that the porosities in table  [ q ] should not be hugely underestimated .",
    "our derived @xmath8 nevertheless essentially agree with the values estimated by heiles ( 1990 ) for m31 and m33 .",
    "his analysis is based on somewhat different criteria with greater uncertainties .",
    "for example , he examined primarily superbubbles that break out of the galactic disk , and included an _ ad hoc _ adjustment in his @xmath302 relation .",
    "note that the existence of the mlf spectrum , which accounts for the clustering of core - collapse sne , has a potentially important effect on the porosity .",
    "whereas @xmath288 uniformly distributed sne will , at their final radii , contribute to @xmath9 simply as @xmath303 , the same sne concentrated into one cluster will contribute as @xmath304 ( for @xmath305 ; equation  [ rf ] ) .",
    "clustered sne in superbubbles therefore produce a larger @xmath9 than the same number of individual sne",
    ". however , this is not the case for @xmath8 , where for both individual and clustered sne , @xmath306 .",
    "although , as we have seen above , the largest shells constitute a larger component of @xmath8 , the relative degree of clustering will not affect the actual value of @xmath8 .",
    "ferrire ( 1995 ) also finds a strong effect of clustering on @xmath9 , using a more complex model for shell evolution in an exponential gas disk .",
    "it is also important to bear in mind the contribution of type  ia snrs ( slavin & cox 1993 ) , although in most star - forming galaxies , these are outnumbered by factors of 310 by core - collapse sne ( van den bergh & tammann 1991 ) . heiles ( 1987 ) emphasizes that the distribution of type  ia sne should vary with galactocentric radius in disk galaxies , owing to the distribution of progenitors , and could therefore cause important radial effects in the ism porosity .",
    "this effect could be a factor in the discrepancy between observed and predicted slopes for m31 and m33 . as mentioned in  6.1",

    ". the effect of the disk scale height should be especially apparent in these galaxies , limiting the growth of shells at these sizes , yet such an effect is not apparent in the data , which show plenty of shells at larger radii .",
    "processes such as propagating star formation and merging could contribute large objects that counteract the expected dearth of large shells . at present , however , the data for the spiral galaxies , especially m33 , are adequately fit by a simple power - law distribution , and there is no strong evidence for a change in characteristics of large superbubbles .",
    "we also predict a peak in the size distribution corresponding to the smallest stalled shells , which would be individual snrs .",
    "the spatial resolution of the data do not yet allow meaningful comparison with prediction .",
    "the contribution of type  ia snrs , which could be substantial ( heiles 1987 ) , should also be apparent near this peak .",
    "our derivation is easily applied to estimating the porosity of the ism .",
    "we find that , not including type  ia snrs , @xmath8 is dominated by individual snrs for @xmath350 , but the few largest shells for @xmath10 . on the other hand , @xmath9",
    "is usually dominated by the largest superbubbles , rather than the multitude of small shells and snrs .",
    "our estimates for the porosities in these galaxies generally show values substantially @xmath351 , with the exception of holmberg  ii .",
    "this therefore predicts that this galaxy would be dominated by a hot interstellar medium , whereas the others would not .",
    "furthermore , merging would not be expected to be a dominant process in the galaxies with porosities @xmath352 , although merging could still flatten the slope of @xmath0 if it is encouraged by spatially clustered shell distributions .",
    "our porosity estimates for these external galaxies are in good agreement with previous calculations ( heiles 1990 ) , with the caveat that they are dependent on the normalizations for @xmath0 .",
    "however , in predicting the sn rate and porosity of the milky way , we find a critical discrepancy between the predicted and observed sn rates : @xmath310 based on the observed  lf underestimates the observed value by an order of magnitude .",
    "the predicted value of @xmath353 leads to porosities @xmath351 , similar to results for the other galaxies .",
    "however , the observed sn rate yields porosities @xmath338 , implying a strong dominance of the him .",
    "it is unclear how this discrepancy should be reconciled , since we have simply recast this pre - existing problem for the galaxy .",
    "our results suggest that ob superbubbles are indeed a dominant source of structure in the ism of galaxies .",
    "we used the simplest and crudest formulations to derive the superbubble size distribution , with the aim of identifying dominant processes and evolutionary features .",
    "the agreement of this derived prediction with the high - quality smc data is unexpectedly excellent and encouraging .",
    "this tentatively suggests that we have fairly successfully identified the basic features of shell evolution , ism parameters , and stellar parameters that are relevant to the global structure and evolution of superbubbles . as new ,",
    "high - resolution  data become available for more galaxies ( thilker 1997 ; kim 1997 ) , we will be able to more rigorously test these results and distinguish unresolved issues .",
    "we have enjoyed discussions with many people , both in cambridge and in the course of two meetings .",
