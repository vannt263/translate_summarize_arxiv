    "discrepancy between the predicted cuspy dm density profiles and the observed rotation curves with shallow profiles has been explained with limited resolution of rotation curves and non - circular motions of gas and with the statement that the actual contribution of visible stellar matter is poorly known .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to derive the density distribution of dark matter in a nearby disc galaxy , the andromeda galaxy .",

    "this simple and straightforward method is frequently used . of course , before calculations the gas rotation curve must be corrected for possible expansion velocities , non - circular motions and dispersions ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the contribution of errors in photometrical surface brightness profiles is small .",
    "there is some uncertainty in component subtraction but its influence due to integration along the line - of - sight is relatively small .",
    "the most significant uncertainty arises from the stage of using chemical evolution models .",
    "first , different colour indices are not in good mutual agreement .",
    "second , chemical evolution models involve several free parameters ( initial mass function ( imf ) , age , star formation duration , contribution of stellar winds etc . ) .",
    "however , it was possible to decrease the influence of all these uncertainties in our final results by using several colour indices @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "in addition , we used independent metallicity measurements allowing us to significantly narrow the possible models .",
    "the uncertainties resulting from chemical evolution models were estimated by constructing a large amount of different models with different initial conditions .",
    "all this allows us to ascribe errors to the final @xmath6 and thereafter to the @xmath16 values of visible matter for all components ( see table  [ model_param2 ] ) .",
    "we derived that within uncertainties nearly all the commonly used analytical dm density profiles fit with limits from observations at nearly all distances .",
    "the best - fitting models , however , are the nfw and the einasto density profiles . usually in similar studies it is concluded that the nfw profile does not fit with observations .",
    "a common approach in this kind of studies at present is to select galaxies without the bulge component or with a small bulge ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gas rotation curve is corrected for non - circular motions and expansion as well as possible .",
    "colour indices of the disc are derived from surface brightness distributions . using a colour-@xmath6 relation ( usually by @xcite ,",
    "updates @xcite ) the mass distribution of visible matter is derived . identifying gas rotation velocities with circular velocities",
    "it is possible to calculate the dm density distribution .    to derive the @xmath6 of visible matter ,",
    "quite frequently only one or two colour indices are used .",
    "this may involve significant uncertainty in the density distribution of visible matter and thereafter in dm .    when modelling s0-sa - sbc disc galaxies with a significant bulge component , it is necessary to take into account a detailed luminosity distribution of the bulge and the disc , finite ellipticities of these components , and both the rotation and the dispersion components in stellar kinematics . when ignoring stellar velocity dispersions , the calculated gravitational potential is smaller .",
    "dispersion components in kinematics of a typical spiral galaxy are more dominating in the central parts of the galaxies ( see fig .  [ gasdispvel ] ) , and thus in the central parts the gravitational potential is underestimated and the resulting dm density profile is flatter near the centre .        even in a sample of low mass disc ,",
    "the power - law index in the central regions of galaxies varies highly @xcite .",
    "thus it is worth not to limit dm density studies with bulgeless low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies but to model also galaxies of intermediate and high luminosities and of different morphological types . in lsb and late morphological type galaxies star formation",
    "is delayed .",
    "this may be caused by insufficiently deep potential well of incompletely formed dm haloes .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that dm density profiles in these galaxies are dominantly not cuspy .",
    "in addition , recent study by @xcite rises the question about the reliability of the use lsb galaxies as a tracer of mass distribution , in particular in the central regions of lsb galaxies .",
    "modelled dispersions along the minor axis ( fig .",
    "[ dispmin2 ] ) and between the major and the minor axis ( fig .",
    "[ dispbulge ] ) do not have a very good fit with the observed stellar dispersions .",
    "unfortunately , this bulge region has been observed only by @xcite and there is a possibility that these observations include some systematic errors that have not been taken into account . on the other hand ,",
    "our models have several free parameters . in our final model ,",
    "we use spherical dm density distributions .",
    "we have tried elliptical dm profiles and in some aspects the elliptical dm profile gives slightly better results . in our model",
    "we have also parameter @xmath17 , which determines the rotational velocity for stellar components . in our model",
    ", @xmath17 is a constant for each subsystem , but principally @xmath17 might be a function of @xmath18 and @xmath19 . as we do not have good quality stellar rotation curves outside the galactic major axis",
    ", we do not know how @xmath17 varies .",
    "the last but not least uncertainty in our model is the orientation of the triaxial velocity ellipsoid . in our model ,",
    "the velocity ellipsoid is radially elongated and lies under the angles @xmath20 with respect to the galactic equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "the velocity ellipsoid orientation is quite uncertain and the orientation can affect the modelled dispersions quite significantly . in one of our following papers we analyse this kind of dynamical models in greater detail .",
    "our derived total mass inside 100kpc ( @xmath21 for nfw and @xmath22 for the einasto model ) is comparable with mass estimates from @xcite ( @xmath23 ) , @xcite ( @xmath24 ) and @xcite ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the ratio of visible matter to total matter ( inside 100kpc ) in our model ( 0.10 for the nfw and 0.092 for the einasto model ) is in good agreement with the results from @xcite ( 0.105 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the ratios from @xcite ( 0.173 ) and @xcite ( 0.152 ) are somewhat higher than ours : the main difference is that they have almost twice as massive a disc as in our model .",
    "@xcite admit that they have degeneracy between the disc and dark halo components : reducing the disc mass and increasing the dark halo mass we get better fit with our model .",
