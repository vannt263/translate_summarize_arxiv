    "<S> to describe the tunneling dynamics of a stack of two - dimensional fermionic superfluids in an optical potential , we derive an effective action functional from a path integral treatment . </S>",
    "<S> this effective action leads , in the saddle point approximation , to equations of motion for the density and the phase of the superfluid fermi gas in each layer . in the strong coupling limit ( where bosonic molecules are formed ) these equations reduce to a discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation , where the molecular tunneling amplitude is reduced for large binding energies . in the weak coupling ( bcs ) regime , we study the evolution of the stacked superfluids and derive an approximate analytical expression for the josephson oscillation frequency in an external harmonic potential . </S>",
    "<S> both in the weak and intermediate coupling regimes the detection of the josephson oscillations described by our path integral treatment constitutes experimental evidence for the fermionic superfluid regime .    </S>",
