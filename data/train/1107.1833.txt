    "understanding the photoelectron properties of dna and rna bases and strands is of central importance to the study of dna damage following exposure to ultraviolet light or ionizing radiation  @xcite , and to the development of fast dna sequencing techniques  @xcite and dna and rna - based molecular electronics and sensors  @xcite .",
    "extensive experimental efforts  @xcite have been made since the 1970 s to measure the photoelectron properties of dna and rna bases . meanwhile ,",
    "theoretical calculations on their ionization potentials and electron affinities have been carried out using density - functional theory ( dft ) and high - level quantum chemistry methods  @xcite .",
    "however , the results from dft calculations are highly dependent on exchange - correlation functionals , and quantum chemistry methods , though more accurate , require considerably more computational effort . in contrast , many - body perturbation theory within hedin s @xmath0 approximation  @xcite presents a unique framework that allows access to both quasi - particle ( qp ) energies and lifetimes on the same footing .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to quasi - one - dimensional(1d ) , two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) semiconductors , insulators , and metals  @xcite , and very recently to molecular systems  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we present the _",
    "entire _ qp spectrum of dna and rna bases using many - body perturbation theory within hedin s @xmath0 approximation , obtained with a recently developed approach that is particularly effective in reaching numerical convergence  @xcite . in the @xmath0 approximation ,",
    "the self - energy operator is expressed as a convolution of the qp green s function @xmath2 with the screened coulomb interaction @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , at increasing system sizes ( as is the case for the present work ) two computational challenges arise : ( i ) first , a large basis set has to be adopted to represent operators such as polarizability , and ( ii ) the calculation of the irreducible dynamical polarizability and that of the self - energy require sums over single - particle conduction states that converge very slowly .",
    "we overcome these two obstacles through ( i ) the use of optimal basis sets for representing the polarization operators  @xcite and ( ii ) the use of a lanczos - chain algorithm  @xcite to avoid explicit sums over empty single - particle states .",
    "in addition , the @xmath1 approximation is adopted , in which the dynamical polarizability is calculated within the random - phase approximation and the qp green s function is replaced by its unperturbed single - particle counterpart .",
    "this approach is implemented in the open - source quantum - espresso distribution  @xcite .",
    "it is applied here to achieve fully converged qp spectra and inverse lifetimes of the five isolated dna and rna bases and to investigate the important but distinct roles of exchange and correlation in the @xmath1 self - energy corrections .",
    "photoelectron properties of dna and rna bases using many - body @xmath0 have not been reported until a very recent study by faber _",
    "et al._@xcite . the work by faber _",
    "presents a many - body @xmath0 study on qp energies ( including ionization potentials and electron affinities ) of dna and rna bases at several levels of self - consistency within the @xmath0 approximation .",
    "their calculations were based on the conventional implementation of the @xmath0 method using a localized basis set and a direct sum - over - states approach , and it demonstrated that self - consistent gw calculations indeed further improve the results of @xmath1 ( one - shot @xmath0 ) calculations . although the localized basis set can significantly improve the computational efficiency and a direct sum - over - states approach can be easily implemented , both of them could have several potential drawbacks , and can introduce large errors in qp energies .",
    "one may solve the former issue by systematically increasing the size of basis sets ; however , there is no simple solution to the convergence problem introduced by the direct sum - over - state approach .",
    "second , dipole - bound conduction states will not be obtained from localized basis sets due to their highly diffuse character in the vacuum region .",
    "in fact , only electron affinities of covalent - bound conduction states were reported in the faber work .",
    "therefore , it would be desirable to calculate @xmath0 qp energies in a plane - wave basis without suffering from the above issues , which is one of the subjects of this research .",

    "the effect of gas - phase tautomeric forms  @xcite of guanine and cytosine on qp properties are beyond the scope of this work , and we only focus on the g9k form of guanine and the c1 form of cytosine  @xcite .",
    "the key quantity in many - body @xmath0 calculations is the irreducible dynamic polarizability @xmath9 in the random - phase approximation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an infinitesimal positive real number .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the direct product of a valence state @xmath13 and a conduction state @xmath14 in real space and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are considered to be real .",
    "a strategy was proposed in refs .   and for obtaining a compact basis set , referred to as _ optimal polarizability basis _ , to represent @xmath9 at all frequencies .",
    "first , we consider the frequency average of @xmath15 which corresponds to the element at time @xmath16 of its fourier transform @xmath17 , without considering the constant ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 we note that @xmath20 is positive definite .",
    "then , the _ optimal polarizability basis _ , @xmath21 , is built from the most important eigenvectors of @xmath20 , corresponding to the largest eigenvalues @xmath22 above a given threshold @xmath8 : @xmath23 it must be noted that this does not require any explicit calculation of empty ( i.e. , conduction ) states as we can use the closure relation : @xmath24 together with an iterative diagonalization scheme .",
    "however , the latter procedure would build polarizability basis sets which are larger than what is necessary for a good convergence of the quasi - particle energy levels .",
    "this stems from treating all the one - particle excitations on the same footing , independent of their energy .",
    "a practical solution would be to limit the sum in eq .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) on the conduction states below a given energy cutoff @xmath7 : @xmath25 however , limiting the sum over the empty states laying in the lower part of the conduction manifold does not allow to use the closure relation alluded to above .    thus , to keep avoiding the calculation of empty states",
    "we replace them in eq .",
    "( [ p2 ] ) with a set of plane waves @xmath26 with their kinetic energies lower than @xmath7 , which are first projected onto the conduction manifold using eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) and then orthonormalized . we indicate these _ augmented plane - waves _ as @xmath27 and arrive at the following modified operator : @xmath28 which is also positive - definite . an optimal polarizability basis @xmath21 is finally obtained by replacing @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ peigen ] ) with @xmath29 .",
    "it should be stressed that the above approximation is used only for obtaining a set of optimal basis vectors for representing the polarization operators and not for the actual calculation of the irreducible dynamic polarizability at finite frequency in eq .",
    "( [ p0 ] ) ; the latter is performed using a lanczos - chain algorithm @xcite . moreover , due to the completeness of the eigenvectors of @xmath30 , for any value of @xmath7 the @xmath0 results will converge to the same values by lowering the threshold @xmath8 , and eventually reach the same results as those obtained by directly using a dense basis of plane - waves . however , compared to the pure plane - waves which are completely delocalized in real space , the optimal polarizability basis is particularly convenient for isolated systems since the most important eigenvectors of @xmath29 will be mostly localized in the regions with higher electron density .",
    "thus , converged results can be obtained using much smaller optimal - polarizability basis sets than plane - waves basis sets .",
    "now , we want to have a closer look at the optimal polarizability basis . the eigenvalue distribution of @xmath29 for cytosine is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarbasis_eigenvalue ] .",
    "we only show the largest 1600 eigenvalues with @xmath31 ev in the plot , since these provide well converged results .",
    "it is clearly seen that the eigenvalues of the optimal polarizability basis decay exponentially and change by almost four orders of magnitude from the first to the last basis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : polarbasis_orbital ] we show the real - space representations of a few selected elements .",
    "the first five , corresponding to the five largest eigenvalues , are strongly localized around the chemical bonds of the molecule .",
    "the second row contains five elements which are more delocalized , and those in the last row are completely delocalized .",
    "this indicates that even though localized optimal bases like those shown in the first two rows can be easily captured by localized basis - sets , the delocalized ones with smaller eigenvalues @xmath22 ( like those in the last row ) are more difficult to capture if diffuse functions are not employed .",
    ", and augmented plane - wave cutoff @xmath7 . results using @xmath32 95.2 and 136.1 ev are plotted in dashed - blue lines and solid - red lines , respectively . ]",
    "the number of optimal - polarizability basis elements @xmath33 and the energy cutoff of the augmented plane - waves @xmath7 are two critical parameters used in our @xmath1 calculations to achieve both efficiency and accuracy .",
    "therefore , we performed a series of calculations to benchmark the convergence with respect to these two parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] , we present the convergence behavior of vips and vb - veas of five dna and rna bases for the highest - occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and the lowest - unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) , respectively : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we find that for both vips and veas convergence within @xmath36 ev is achieved with @xmath37 optimal basis elements for @xmath38 ev and with @xmath39 optimal basis elements for @xmath40 ev . indeed ,",
    "similar trends were reported in ref .  .",
    "vips and veas reported in the following sections are calculated using the most strict parameters ( @xmath41 and @xmath31 ev ) .",
    "the above benchmark indicates that , if basis - sets and conduction states in dft calculations are not properly tested , one could easily obtain non - converged results from @xmath1 calculations , resulting in higher vips and lower veas for all five bases .",

    "furthermore , experimental vb - veas are negative for all five bases , indicating that excited @xmath52 states are unstable upon electron attachment .",
    "this leads to challenging measurements of veas and a wide range of measured values  @xcite listed in table  [ table1 ] : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , for a , c , t , and u. compared to the mean values of experimental veas , the mean absolute errors of the calculated veas for four bases is 0.45 ev .",
    "interestingly , the vea of guanine has never been measured successfully , possibly due to a large negative value .",
    "this is clearly reflected in our calculated @xmath1 vea of @xmath47 ev , which is the most negative one among all five bases . even though the @xmath1 veas of thymine and uracil are slightly positive , the trend for all the calculated veas agrees well with experiments .",
    "in addition , the dft - pbe homo - lumo gaps for the five bases are about 45% of the @xmath1 gaps .",
    "this is in agreement with previous observations that dft with the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of exchange - correlation functionals usually underestimates by 30 - 50% the true qp energy gap  @xcite .",

( a ) @xmath1 exchange energy @xmath67 , ( b ) @xmath1 correlation energy @xmath68 , ( c ) the sum of @xmath1 exchange and correlation energy @xmath69 ( filled symbols ) and dft xc energy @xmath70 ( unfilled symbols ) , and ( d ) the difference between @xmath1 and dft exchange - correlation energy , @xmath71 .",
    "four types of molecular orbitals are illustrated in ( a)(d ) , corresponding to @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath60 , and @xmath58 characters . ]    to understand the role of exchange and correlation in the self - energy corrections to the dft - pbe results , we first express each kohn - sham eigenvalue @xmath74 of eigenstate @xmath75 for the @xmath60-th state as the sum of a single - particle energy @xmath76 and an exchange - correlation energy @xmath70 : @xmath77 , where @xmath76 contains the energy contributions from the kinetic energy operator , the external ionic potential , and the hartree term .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath1 qp energy can be written in terms of the exchange self - energy @xmath67 and of the correlation self - energy @xmath78 : @xmath79 .",
    "exchange and correlation effects can then be systematically investigated by analyzing @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath80 , with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we consider the adenine molecule and plot the above quantities with respect to the @xmath1 qp energy @xmath83 . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : energy_decomposition](a ) and ( b ) , the @xmath1 exchange energy @xmath67 increases from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ev for the 25 valence states and from @xmath86 to @xmath87 ev for the 10 conduction states , while the @xmath1 correlation energy @xmath68 decreases from 7.1 down to 0.2 ev for the valence states and from @xmath88 to @xmath89 ev for the conduction states .",
    "this clearly shows that @xmath67 is always negative , stabilizing both electron and hole excitations ; however , @xmath68 is positive for valence states and negative for conduction states , indicating that the effect of correlation is that of destabilizing hole excitations and of stabilizing electron excitations .",
    "although @xmath67 and @xmath68 have opposite trends for hole excitations , exchange interactions eventually dominate due to their larger magnitude , leading to the negative @xmath69 of fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_decomposition](c )",
    ". interestingly , the @xmath1 @xmath69 is lower than the dft - pbe @xmath70 for the valence states , but higher than @xmath70 for the conduction states .",
    "consequently , the difference @xmath90 between @xmath69 and @xmath70 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_decomposition](d ) , is negative for the valence manifold and positive for the conduction manifold , resulting in an increased homo - lumo gap .",
    "the same behavior is observed for the other four bases as well .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_decomposition ] , we can recognize five major orbital types among the valence and conduction orbitals of the isolated adenine molecule : @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath60 , @xmath58 , and dipole - bound states .",
    "the lowest six states correspond to @xmath61 orbitals due to @xmath91-@xmath91 hybridization , which have larger @xmath1 exchange , correlation , and total self - energy corrections than the other states .",
    "the following ten states at higher energy levels exhibit @xmath73 character , and their @xmath67 and @xmath68 show a linear but opposite dependence with respect to the @xmath1 qp energy @xmath83 .",
    "thus , their sum @xmath69 is shown to be almost constant , ranging from @xmath92 to @xmath93 ev .",
    "since the same trend is present in @xmath70 , the final difference @xmath80 between @xmath1 and dft results stays almost constant , between @xmath94 and @xmath95 ev . the next three @xmath60 and six @xmath58 valence states and three @xmath52 conduction states have a similar behavior , despite different magnitudes in their self - energy corrections . in particular , the six @xmath58 valence states are lowered by about @xmath96 ev , while the three @xmath52 conduction states are lifted by 2.1 ev , leading to an increase of 4.6 ev for the homo - lumo gap .",
    "the above observations provide an important evidence that the @xmath1 self - energy corrections are highly orbital - dependent and on average @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 .",
    "consequently , the commonly - used `` scissor operator '' to correct bandgaps by rigidly lowering the valence levels and increasing the conduction levels by the same amount will never be adequate for describing the entire qp spectrum .",
    "in summary , vips , veas , and dos of five dna and rna bases obtained from a fully converged many - body @xmath1 approach are found to be in very good agreement with experiments and other theoretical works .",
    "two types of vertical electron affinities are found , corresponding to localized valence - bound excitations and delocalized dipole - bound excitations .",
    "our calculations further reveal that qp inverse lifetimes depend linearly on qp energies for the deep valence states .",
    "they , however , come from the zero - th order @xmath1 estimation , and may be significantly affected in self - consistent @xmath0 calculations .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath1 self - energy corrections are highly orbital dependent , but remain relatively constant for the states with similar bonding character .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 vips of lone pair states deviate from the experimental ones more than those for @xmath58 states . whether this difference comes from the different self - interaction errors in kohn - sham eigenstates will require further studies using self - interaction corrected functionals  @xcite ; work is in progress along this direction .",
    "the authors would like to thank davide ceresoli and andrea ferretti for valuable discussions .",
