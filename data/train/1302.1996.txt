    "in contrast , our measurements unravel the contribution of the he droplets bands to the penning ionization signal with high spectral resolution .",
    "in particular , the high li@xmath16 signal in the 1s2p@xmath1p band shows that penning ionization of surface - bound dopants is as efficient when exciting short - lived ( @xmath75ps ) states  @xcite as for metastable states .",

    "the ionization traces of all studied alkali species li , na , k closely follow the fluorescence spectrum . only in the case of k the band around 24ev",
    "is slightly more pronounced .",
    "thus , the ionization of alkali adducts sensitively probes the cross section for excitation of he droplets , nearly irrespective of the final state of excitation .",
    "one may argue that the alkali dopants are preferentially ionized by transfer from he@xmath3 created in the outer surface region close to the dopants in the first place .",
    "however , the absorption spectrum of he atoms in that region of low density resembles more the one of free he atoms with narrow peaks close to 21.2ev and 23.1ev which are visible in the fluorescence spectrum  @xcite . since",
    "our alkali ionization spectra only reproduce the broadband structure associated with he@xmath3 excitations in the bulk of the droplets  @xcite we argue that while he@xmath3 are mostly created in the droplet interior , they migrate towards the alkali dopant at the surface driven by repulsive short - range he - he@xmath3 forces and possibly by alkali - he@xmath3 polarization forces .",
    "note that also the peak shapes of penning and fluorescence signals are very similar .",
    "thus , penning ionization is equally efficient for the excitation of the lower and the higher energetic edges of each band , which are commonly attributed to localized excitations at the surface or in the bulk , respectively  @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that homogeneous peak broadening actually dominates over the assumed inhomogeneous broadening effect obtained by averaging over shifted atomic levels due to varying he density in different regions of the droplet .    in order to assess the efficiency of the he mediated ionization of alkalis via the penning process we tried to measure the yield of alkali ions from doped he droplets obtained by direct photoionization at photon energies @xmath76ev , that is , below the lowest excitations of he droplets .",
    "the intensity of higher order radiation was reduced using a neon ( ne ) gas filter installed in the beamline connecting the detector chamber to the synchrotron . however , even at the highest possible ne gas pressure , direct ionization of he could not be sufficiently reduced to suppress charge transfer ionization of the alkali dopants .",

    "the shaded area ( 4 ) indicates the range of energies of all possible vibronic levels of he@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "our consideration of the unperturbed atomic he@xmath3 and molecular he@xmath2 levels is motivated by the fact that alkalis atoms are bound at a distance of 5 - 6 from the he droplet surface  @xcite , significantly more than the average distance between he atoms in the droplet interior of about 3.5  @xcite .",
    "thus we expect the he@xmath3 excitation to be only weakly perturbed in the process of penning ionizing the alkali dopant .    despite the low resolution",
    "the spectra clearly indicate a shift of photoelectron energies to lower values with respect to the one expected for direct excitation transfer ionization out of the atomic 1s2p@xmath1p state .",
    "note that previous work on the direct photoionization of alkali dopants on he nanodroplets revealed a shift of the photoelectron energy by about 17mev toward higher energies due to the photoion - he interaction for which we find no indications  @xcite . in the li case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pespectra ] b ) ) , the photoelectron energy is peaked at that of the 1s2s@xmath1s and 1s2s@xmath18s levels , whereas for na and k it seems that transfer ionization of the dopants is preceded by the formation of he@xmath2 in various vibronic levels .",
    "this difference may be related to the larger delocalization of li as compared to the other alkalis due to larger zero - point motion  @xcite .",
    "the shifting of the penning features with respect to the energy expected for direct ionization clearly points at a more complex , time - delayed ionization dynamics instead of the optical dipole - like process .",
    "apparently this process involves the migration of the he@xmath3 excitation through the he droplet , the relaxation into lower levels of he@xmath3 and he@xmath2 , followed by ionization of the alkali dopant in a penning collision - type process . note that previous experiments with bulk superfluid he revealed the formation of he@xmath2 in highly excited vibrational levels by tunneling through the he - he@xmath3 barrier followed by slow relaxation into the ground state , as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "this scenario of indirect penning ionization is corroborated by the observation of a vanishing anisotropy parameter of the photoelectron angular distribution measured in coincidence with alkali ions @xmath108 , in contrast to @xmath109 for direct photoionization of free he atoms and @xmath110 measured in coincidence with he@xmath17 or ar@xmath17 ions from doped he droplets at @xmath41ev .",
    "if optical dipole - like ionization were the dominant process , both energies and angular distributions of photoelectrons correlated to the alkali ions would match those of directly ionized alkali atoms  @xcite , which is not the case .",
    "photoelectron spectra of he nanodroplets doped with kr and xe measured at @xmath39ev showed that droplet - induced relaxation 1s2p@xmath1p@xmath401s2s@xmath1s is likely to precede penning ionization of the dopants  @xcite .",
    "however , no indications of further relaxation into lower - lying levels of he@xmath3 or he@xmath2 were found .",
    "the reason for the higher degree of relaxation observed in our experiments using alkali dopants may be related to longer interaction times of he@xmath3 with the droplet environment prior to excitation transfer to the dopant .",
    "since the he@xmath3 excitations tend to migrate to the surface , that is away from the dissolved rare gas dopants kr and xe , the he@xmath3-dopant interaction time is much shorter than in the case of alkali dopants .",
    "further insight into the dynamics of migration and relaxation could be obtained from time resolved measurements using doped he nanodroplets similar to the ones recently performed with pure droplets  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : zekeliar ] a ) again matches the one correlating to he@xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath117 no direct ionization of he atoms is possible and only he@xmath17 and electrons with very low kinetic energies are produced by autoionization  @xcite .",
    "this , however , implies that the he@xmath17 charge remains mobile enough within the droplet to meet and ionize the ar@xmath23 dopant .",
    "thus , we believe that the concept of resonant hopping of he@xmath16 charges should be extended to he@xmath17 and possibly to larger cluster ions which would involve he nuclear motion similar to the combined propagation of electronic excitation and diatomic proximity in an ensemble of rydberg atoms  @xcite .",
    "the lack of photoelectron spectral components around @xmath118ev indicates that penning ionization is again unlikely .",
    "this may appear unexpected given that the excited superposition of perturbed 1s3p@xmath1p and 1s4p@xmath1p states is delocalized over part of the he droplet  @xcite .",
    "apparently , the directed he@xmath3 migration outwards to the surface nearly completely suppresses penning ionization of dopants at the droplet center .",
    "alternatively , autoionization followed by charge transfer ionization could occur when the he@xmath3 excitation has just reached the ar@xmath23 dopant prior to penning ionization .",
    "this scenario appears highly implausible , though , considering the large cross section of he@xmath3-ar penning ionization collisions  @xcite which even rises in the low collision energy regime provided by the cold droplet environment  @xcite .    the photoelectron spectrum recorded in coincidence with li@xmath16 at @xmath114ev shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zekeliar ] b ) also closely resembles the one at @xmath39ev .",
    "only a small peak at an electron energy of 18.6ev indicates that a small fraction of li dopants is ionized by excitation transfer from the originally excited droplet state whereas the larger part of the electron spectrum stems from penning processes involving relaxed states of he@xmath3 and he@xmath2 .",
    "thus , the relaxation of 1s3p@xmath1p and 1s4p@xmath1p states proceeds at least as fast as relaxation of the 1s2p@xmath1p droplet state .    ,",
    "ar@xmath17 , and li@xmath16 ions as various photon energies.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    finally , we address the observation of photoelectrons with nearly zero kinetic energy ( zeke ) which appear in all experiments performed in regime ( ii ) of droplet autoionization ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vmi ] d ) ) .",
    "while the exact formation mechanism of the zeke electrons is still under discussion , vibrational autoionization of highly excited states of the ( doped ) he droplet seems most likely  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of zeke electrons has recently been measured in time - resolved experiments yielding a time constant of 1.5 - 2.5ps , limited by the dynamics of relaxation into lower - lying , non - emitting states  @xcite .",
    "we add to this discussion by measuring the zeke signal in coincidence with he@xmath17 , ar@xmath17 and li@xmath16 dopant ions . in order to avoid inaccuracies caused by artifacts from the inverse abel transformation procedure ,",
    "the zeke signal is determined by integrating the counts in the raw images within a small circular area with a radius corresponding to an electron energy of @xmath119mev .",
    "the resulting zeke signal is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeke ] as a function of @xmath31 .",
    "clearly , the highest zeke signal is measured in regime ( ii ) at @xmath120ev in coincidence with he@xmath17 , which is the dominant product from autoionization and subsequent fragmentation of the he droplets .",
    "note that the data point at @xmath41ev highly overestimates the zeke signal since it mainly shows the contribution of photoelectrons with an energy of 0.4ev produced by direct he ionization which is partly included by the image analysis . the small zeke signal measured in coincidence with ar@xmath17 at @xmath113ev results from autoionization of the he droplets and subsequent transfer ionization of argon , as discussed above .    aside from zeke electrons produced by autoionization of the he droplets ,",
    "we measure a considerable fraction of zeke electrons in coincidence with li@xmath16 dopants produced by penning ionization at @xmath39ev and at @xmath121ev .",
    "a similar observation was previously made using he droplets doped with rare gases  @xcite .",
    "note that zeke electrons have also been seen for the case of directly laser - ionizing alkali dopants at excess energies of about 1.8ev  @xcite .",
    "the present observation of zeke electrons from an ionization process that involves an excess energy of up to 16ev that is dissipated by the he droplet clearly shows that a different mechanism of slowing down electrons presumably by collisions with he has to be active here which still eludes any founded interpretation .",
    "we have reported synchrotron experiments to study the ionization dynamics of he nanodroplets doped with alkali metal atoms ( li , na , k ) which we compare to rare gas ( ar ) dopants .",
    "in contrast to the rare gas dopants which are embedded in the droplet interior , surface - bound alkali atoms are found to be most efficiently ionized by the transfer of excitation from he@xmath3 and he@xmath2 in various excited states in a penning - type process .",
    "we rationalize the enhanced penning ionization rate by the directed migration of the excitation from the bulk outwards to the alkali dopants followed by excitation transfer .",
    "this contrasts the well - established hopping dynamics of a he@xmath16 positive hole which is directed inwards into the droplet center where charge transfer ionization of embedded dopants occurs .",
    "however , the different dependencies of ionization efficiencies on the droplet size as well as photoelectron spectra correlated to the dopant ions indicate more complex migration and relaxation dynamics in the case of penning ionization compared to charge transfer ionization . simulations taking into account the structure of the doped he droplets as well as many - body correlation effects",
    "are required for gaining a better understanding of the dynamic response of doped he nanodroplets to photoexcitations .",
