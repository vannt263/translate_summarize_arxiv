    "in recent years , astronomers have extensively developed the art of selecting interesting , high redshift objects on the basis of their broad band colors .",
    "color selection has long been used to separate distant quasar candidates from the multitude of foreground stars either via their uv excess ( e.g. , veron 1983 ) or by color criteria based on the passage of the 1216   lyman  @xmath14 forest and 912  lyman limit discontinuities through broad passbands ( e.g. , warren 1987 ) .",
    "guhathakurta , tyson , & majewski ( 1990 ) applied the latter technique to search for high redshift galaxies , and the method was brought to fruition by steidel ( 1996a , b , 1999 ) who have successfully identified and spectroscopically confirmed nearly 1000 galaxies at @xmath15 using this approach .",
    "other interesting classes of objects have been selected and studied on the basis of having extremely red optical  to  infrared colors ( e.g. , elston , rieke , & rieke 1988 , 1989 ; hu & ridgway 1994 ; graham & dey 1996 ; thompson 1999a ) . some of these turn out to be early type galaxies at high redshift , while others are both distant and dust  obscured . in general , estimating galaxy redshifts from broad band colors is now a popular industry , and much progress has been made in applying such techniques at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. , brunner , connolly & szalay 1999 ) and for identifying candidates for extremely distant galaxies ( lanzetta , yahil , & fernndez ",
    "soto 1996 ) .",
    "indeed , some of the most distant galaxies now known have been found in this way ( e.g. , hdf 4 - 473 , weymann 1998 ; hdf 3 - 951 , spinrad 1998 ) .",
    "the hubble deep fields ( north and south , or hdf  n and hdf  s , williams 1996 and 1999 ) have been valuable data sets for exploring such techniques because of the extremely deep , multiwavelength data which are available . the hdf ",
    "n has recently been the subject of two near  infrared surveys with nicmos ( thompson 1998 ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) : a deep image of a @xmath16  arcmin@xmath17 sub  region ( thompson 1999b ) , and a shallower map of the entire field ( dickinson 1999 ; see also dickinson 1999 ) .",
    "these data offer new opportunities for identifying interesting objects on the basis of their colors . here",
    "we describe an object with perhaps the most unusual colors in the hdf ",
    "n , which is significantly detected only at @xmath18 m",
    ". the object was first noted by lanzetta , yahil , & fernndez  soto ( 1998 ) , who used the ground  based infrared images which we obtained at kitt peak national observatory ( cf .",
    "dickinson 1998 ) to identify candidate @xmath19band sources without optical counterparts .",
    "we discuss our imaging and spectroscopic observations of this object , and consider various interpretations of its nature .",
    "we observed the hdf  n with nicmos between ut 1998 june 13 and june 23 , during the second refocus campaign when the hst secondary mirror was moved to ensure optimal focus for nicmos camera 3 .",
    "the observations and data reduction will be described in detail elsewhere ( dickinson 1999 ) ; the immediately relevant aspects are summarized here . the complete hdf ",
    "n was mosaiced with 8 sub  fields , each imaged during three separate visits . during each visit",
    ", exposures were taken through both the f110w ( 1.1@xmath1 m ) and f160w ( 1.6@xmath1 m ) filters .",
    "( henceforth we will refer to the six wfpc2 and nicmos hdf bandpasses as 300 , 450 , 606 , 814 , 110 and 160 . )",
    "each section of the mosaic was dithered through 9 independent positions , with a net exposure time of 12600s per filter , except in a few cases where telescope tracking was lost due to hst fine guidance sensor failures .",
    "the region of interest for this paper did not lose any exposure time .",
    "the data were processed using a combination of stsci pipeline routines and custom software , and were combined into a single mosaic , accurately registered to the hdf ",
    "n wfpc2 images , using the `` drizzling '' method of fruchter & hook ( 1999 ) .",
    "the nicmos images have a point spread function ( psf ) with fwhm  @xmath20  022 , primarily limited by the pixel scale ( 02 ) of camera  3 .",
    "sensitivity varies over the field of view due to variations in nicmos quantum efficiency and exposure time , but on average the images have a signal  to  noise ratio @xmath21 within an @xmath22 diameter aperture at @xmath23 for both the 110 and 160 filters . , where @xmath24 is the flux density in njy averaged over the filter bandpass . ] in order to ensure properly matched photometry between the optical and infrared images , the wfpc2 data were convolved to match the nicmos psf .",
    "photometric catalogs were constructed using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , by detecting objects in the nicmos images and measuring fluxes through matched apertures in all bands .",
    "we noticed the object which we will call hdf ",
    "n  j123656.3 + 621322 , or  for brevity , during an initial visual inspection of the nicmos data for objects with unusual colors .",
    "it is prominent at 1.6@xmath1 m , but apparently invisible through all other hst filters , including 110 ( figure  1 ) .",
    "figure  2 shows a @xmath25 vs.  160 color  magnitude diagram highlighting the object s extreme and unusual color . in @xmath25 ,",
    "is by far the reddest among the @xmath26 objects detected in our nicmos survey .",
    "careful inspection of the nicmos data convinces us that this is a real astronomical source , not an artifact , and that there is no evidence that it is transient or variable .",
    "it is visible in each of the nine individual , dithered 160 exposures , which were taken during telescope visits on ut 1998 june 16 , 20 and 2223 , but is not detected in any of the corresponding 110 exposures taken during those same visits .",
    "we know of no nicmos anomaly or optics ghost which could produce an artifact resembling what we observe .",
    "moreover , the object is detected in two independent , ground  based near  ir data sets .",
    "it is faintly visible ( @xmath27 ) in the @xmath28 ( 2.16@xmath1 m ) hdf images which we obtained with irim on the kpno 4 m telescope in 1996 april  may ( cf .",
    "dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "is the brightest of the five @xmath19band selected , optically invisible candidates identified by lanzetta ( 1998 ) from the kpno irim hdf images .",
    "their other four candidates have no counterparts in the nicmos 110 or 160 data , implying either that they are exceptionally red at @xmath29 m , or that they are not real .",
    "to verify the @xmath28 detection and to improve the quality of the photometry , we obtained new @xmath28 images using nirc ( matthews & soifer 1994 ) on the keck  i telescope on ut 1999 april 5 .",
    "108 dithered 60  second exposures were taken through light , intermittent cirrus and processed using the dimsum reduction software .",
    "the individual frames were scaled and weighted before combination using measured counts of a moderately bright , nearby star centered in the nirc field .",
    "the combined image has a psf fwhm  @xmath30 .",
    "the photometric zeropoint was bootstrapped from the irim @xmath28 data using large aperture measurements of two stars , which gave excellent internal agreement .",
    "is readily visible as a compact source in the nirc image ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we summarize photometry of the object in table  1 . in order to set limits in the hst bands 300 through 110",
    ", we measured fluxes in a @xmath22 diameter circular aperture at the 160 centroid position .",
    "this aperture maximizes @xmath31 for the object in the 160 image , and is very close to that required to maximize @xmath31 for point sources .",
    "we also have verified that the optical measurements in table  1 are consistent with limits derived from the original , unconvolved wfpc2 images .",
    "a 21% aperture correction , derived from the 160 image , has been applied to the measurements , errors and limits in all hst bands to adjust the fluxes to `` total '' values .",
    "this correction assumes that the object has similar morphology at all wavelengths , which can not be verified at present .",
    "we followed a similar procedure for the nirc @xmath28 image , using photometry measured within a @xmath32 diameter aperture , corrected to total flux using curve of growth measurements of the reference star .",
    "we also measured the object in the irim @xmath28 image using a method based on that of fernndez  soto , lanzetta & yahil ( 1999 ) .",
    "the nicmos image is used as a template , convolved to match the irim psf , and then fit to the ground  based data .",
    "the nirc and irim measurements ( @xmath33 and 23.8 , respectively ) agree within their errors , and with the value measured by lanzetta ( 1998 ) ( @xmath34 ) from the same irim data .",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath36 color limits for @xmath25 are @xmath372.8 and @xmath372.3 , respectively , while @xmath38 .",
    "has @xmath39 in all bands other than 160 and @xmath28 , regardless of the aperture size used .",
    "however , we do measure formally positive counts above the background at 450 , 606 , 814 and 110 .",
    "although measurements at low significance levels are prone to systematic uncertainties in background subtraction , etc .",
    ", there is nevertheless the possibility that the object does have non  zero optical flux . to explore this further ,",
    "we have used an additional 63000s wfpc2 814 image of the hdf obtained by gilliland , nugent , & phillips ( 1999 ) in a search for high redshift supernovae .",
    "r.  gilliland kindly provided his sum of all available hdf ",
    "n @xmath40 data in the wf3 region , with a total exposure time of 186600s .",
    "we registered this image with the data in other bandpasses .",
    "photometry on the unconvolved , `` grand sum '' 814 image in an @xmath22 aperture centered at the nominal position of 1  measures a flux of @xmath41  njy ( with no aperture correction ) , or a formal @xmath42 .    to assess the significance of this optical measurement",
    ", we carried out a simple fluctuation analysis on the wfpc2 data .",
    "the images were normalized to constant variance over the field of view by dividing by smoothed noise maps which are generated as part of the data reduction process .",
    "we used sextractor to generate masks which exclude all readily detectable sources in each image , including generous buffer regions around each .",
    "we fit smooth background maps to the `` blank sky '' regions and subtracted them from the images .",
    "the data were filtered by a gaussian with fwhm  @xmath43 ( matching the wfpc2 psf ) , and the distribution of pixel values over an 855  arcsec@xmath17 region was compared to that near the position of .",
    "we did this for each wfpc2 image , for variance weighted sums of the optical bandpasses , and also for @xmath44 combinations constructed following the procedure of szalay , connolly , & szokoly ( 1999 ) .",
    "the results from the @xmath44 images were statistically similar to those from the weighted sums , so we describe only the latter here .",
    "the filtered pixel values have a nearly gaussian distribution ( whose width in a given image we will characterize as @xmath45 here ) , with a positive tail due to faint sources . at the nominal 1  peak position",
    ", the filtered 814 image has a value which exceeds the local background by @xmath46 , and in the weighted @xmath47 image by @xmath48 .",
    "there is a stronger local peak in the filtered 814 and 606 + 814 images located @xmath49 from the nominal 1  position , which exceeds the local background by 3.1@xmath45 in 814 and by 3.3@xmath45 in @xmath47 . including the 450 data in the weighted sums or @xmath44 images",
    "does not strengthen the peak .",
    "its formal significance depends on how one treats the non  gaussian tail of positive pixel values due to faint sources . excluding buffered regions around all objects detected in the infrared catalogs",
    ", we find that there is a 5.1% chance of a pixel in the filtered 606 + 814 images exceeding this `` 3.3@xmath45 '' threshold within @xmath49 of a location specified _ a priori_. the infrared catalogs , however , miss faint blue galaxies which are readily visible in the optical data , and which contribute to this positive tail .",
    "excluding all objects detected in the infrared _ or _ optical sextractor catalogs , the chance probability drops to 1.8% .",
    "the exact probabilities depend on the detection threshold used for the catalogs .",

    "we have tried to test its reality by subdividing the grating 4 exposures into independently averaged , randomly selected half data sets . however",
    "the @xmath31 in each half  set is low ; the apparent line sometimes appears in both , sometimes not .",
    "its significance is hard to evaluate because noise in the data is correlated ( e.g. , sky subtraction residuals ) with greatly varying amplitude vs.  wavelength . as a test , we normalized the coadded , two dimensional spectral image by the variance map to equalize the pixel  to  pixel rms throughout , and extracted 26 spatially independent , 3 pixel wide spectra from regions of the slit unaffected by the reference star .",
    "each extraction was subtracted to zero mean , and then convolved by a gaussian with the instrumental resolution .",

    "no comparable positive feature was found , and only one negative feature , suggesting a probability @xmath69 ( 1 out of @xmath70 ) that the  `` line '' would arise by chance .",
    "our spectroscopic results are therefore ambiguous .",
    "the line in the grating 4 spectrogram is resilient but not ironclad .",
    "the fact that it does not reproduce in the grating 1 observation suggests either that it is not real , or that it is well resolved at the higher dispersion ( thus reducing the detection sensitivity ) , or that the object was not well placed in the spectrograph slit on may 7 .",

    "the known hdf stars have stellarity @xmath75 , while 1  has stellarity @xmath76 ( figure 4c ) .",

    "these breaks would redshift beyond the wfpc2 bandpasses into the near  ir , maximizing the @xmath25 color .",

    "however , this would require that a @xmath121 elliptical have a spectrum nearly as red as that of 4 - 752.1 at @xmath122 , despite the universe being considerably younger .",
    "this is difficult to explain without invoking an unusual imf , an unpopular cosmology , or extinction .",
    "figure  7 shows the infrared colors of hdf galaxies with known redshifts , along with models computed using the population synthesis code of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 , 1996 ) .",

    "adopted cosmology , 1  would have an absolute @xmath113 magnitude @xmath126 .",
    "if it were an `` old '' elliptical galaxy at @xmath7 , this would strongly suggest that at least some galaxies formed the bulk of their stars at extremely large redshifts .",
    "if so , however , then it is puzzling that there are no other hdf galaxies nearly as red , as might be expected if there were a continuum of such objects extending out to @xmath121 .",
    "red , early  type galaxies have been identified spectroscopically out to @xmath127 ( e.g. , dunlop 1996 ; spinrad 1997 ; dickinson 1997 ; dey 1998 ) and photometrically in the hdf and elsewhere out to @xmath128 ( cf .",

    "an additional break is introduced by the lyman  @xmath14 forest , which is increasingly thick at higher redshifts and affects broad band colors to a correspondingly greater degree ( cf .",
    "lowenthal 1997 , dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "we do not know the opacity of the lyman  @xmath14 forest at @xmath134 , but may reasonably assume that it continues to increase since we believe that the universe was dominated by neutral hydrogen beyond some reionization redshift .",
    "if we interpret  as a lyman break object , then its @xmath135 color is matched for @xmath8 , but the red @xmath136 color suggests that the lyman  @xmath14 forest has eaten away roughly half of the @xmath137 flux , implying a redshift @xmath138 ( see figure  7 ) . at that redshift , the @xmath19band corresponds to @xmath139  in the emitted frame , essentially the same wavelength where steidel select galaxies in their survey at @xmath121 .",
    "we may therefore make a direct comparison to the observed @xmath121 luminosity function ( dickinson 1998 , steidel 1999 ) .",

    "it is equivalent to the effective volume of the @xmath143 lyman break selection function ( see steidel 1999 ) over a 100  arcmin@xmath17 field .",
    "because the volume is heavily weighted toward the highest redshifts , then it is not unlikely that the rarest , most luminous objects would also be the most distant , provided that they exist at all beyond @xmath134 . in our ground  based survey we often find @xmath121 qsos that are brighter than the most luminous lyman break galaxies , and the nearly unresolved morphology of 1  might plausibly indicate that it is some sort of agn .",
    "populations of distant qsos have been postulated as a means of reionizing the universe at high redshift , although existing models for the formation of high redshift agn ( haiman & loeb 1998 ; haehnelt , natarajan , & rees 1998 ) would predict that no objects as bright as 1  should be found within the hdf volume at @xmath144 .",
    "if  were a galaxy forming stars at @xmath141 with a salpeter imf and without dust , its uv luminosity would correspond to a star formation rate  @xmath145 ( 70 or 400@xmath146 for einstein  de  sitter or @xmath147 open universes ) .",
    "this is the sort of rate required by monolithic collapse models which would form a @xmath148 galaxy within a short ( @xmath149  yr ) time scale , and is also comparable to the _ obscured _ star formation rates which have been claimed for high redshift sub ",

    "if rapid , monolithic galaxy formation took place anywhere in that redshift range , then either it was quite uncommon , or it was obscured by dust .",

    "an emission line , however , might suggest active star formation inconsistent with a maximally old elliptical galaxy , thus requiring either the presence of an agn , dust , or both .",

    "line fluxes @xmath175 and @xmath176 in the @xmath137 and @xmath28 bands , respectively , could mimic the broad band fluxes measured for .",
    "the possible 1.643@xmath1 m emission line , if real , could therefore account for the entire signal detected in the nicmos 160 image .",
    "detection at both @xmath137 and @xmath28 makes the `` pure emission line '' hypothesis seem less plausible , however , requiring either strong lines in both bands or an extremely red continuum . in the latter case",
    ", we are forced back to our previous speculations .",
    "without further data , we can not unambiguously distinguish between these explanations for the nature of .",
    "each , however , is quite remarkable in its own right .",
    "perhaps the least `` exotic '' extragalactic hypothesis is that 1  is a dusty , hr10like galaxy at @xmath6 .",
    "such objects , with sub ",
    "mm fluxes just below the current scuba detection limits , might be sufficiently common to make up the bulk of the far  infrared background ( barger , cowie & sanders 1999 ) . the possibility that  is an `` old '' elliptical galaxy at @xmath7 is perhaps more remarkable , in that it would strongly suggest that at least some galaxies formed the bulk of their stars at very large redshifts .",
    "progenitor to an old , @xmath177 elliptical might well resemble . ]    perhaps the most spectacular interpretation of this object , but also the one requiring the most rigorous proof , would be that it lies at @xmath144 , an extremely distant analog of the lyman break galaxy population .",
    "if this were the case , then its high luminosity and the relatively small volume of the hdf would suggest that we were either extremely lucky , or that such objects were more common than would be expected based on an extrapolation of the @xmath121 population to higher redshifts . if the luminosity results from star formation , then  would resemble the classical picture of a protogalaxy , forming stars at @xmath178 .",
    "however , the implied space density of _ unobscured _ objects with such star formation rates is far smaller than that of @xmath12 galaxies today .",
    "if galaxies formed monolithically at high redshift , then this was either a rare occurrence , or the process was largely enshrouded by dust , as has been suggested by the recent detection of distant sub  mm sources .",

    "this object will require new observations , but none will be easy .",
    "spectroscopy will be challenging even with the new generation of ir instruments on 8 to 10 m telescopes , and there is no guarantee that the object has detectable emission lines . although our understanding of the transparency of the igm at @xmath129 is based solely on extrapolation , a robust optical detection would probably exclude the lyman break hypothesis . occasionally , qso sightlines at lower redshifts are free of optically thick h  i absorption ( e.g. , reimers 1992 ) , but it seems unlikely that emitted  frame lyman continuum from an ordinary galaxy or qso could propagate through the universe from @xmath183 without being absorbed .",
    "the optical measurement in  2 is suggestive but not highly significant ; a deeper optical image , e.g. , with stis or the forthcoming hst advanced camera for surveys , would be a valuable ( albeit expensive ) observation .",
    "photometry at @xmath184 m with irac on sirtf could distinguish between the @xmath144 lyman break and @xmath185 red galaxy hypotheses , since the spectra of red galaxies should continue to rise toward longer wavelengths , with @xmath186jy , while a star forming galaxy at @xmath144 should have a flatter , fainter sed ( see figure  6 ) . if near ",
    "ir spectroscopy fails to detect emission lines , then the best hopes for distinguishing between the old galaxy and reddened starburst / agn models lie at longer wavelengths .",
