    "cosmic strings have gained a lot of renewed interest over the past years due to their possible connection to string theory @xcite . these are topological defects @xcite that could have formed in one of the numerous phase transitions in the early universe due to the kibble mechanism .",

    "it would be very interesting to observe these objects in the universe . in recent years",
    "the detection of these objects has focused on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data @xcite , though other observational effects such as gravitational lensing have also been discussed @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the possibility that cosmic strings might be detected due to the way that test particles move in their space  time .    until now the geodesic motion of test particles in space ",
    "times containing cosmic strings has been mostly studied in the limit of vanishing width of the cosmic string .",
    "since the space  time of an infinitely thin cosmic string is locally flat @xcite geodesics are just straight lines . in @xcite a general cosmic space ",
    "time has been studied and it has been shown that the geodesics of massless particles must move to infinity in both direction .",
    "geodesics in cosmic string space ",
    "times have also been used to explain the motion of particles in elastic solids @xcite .",
    "furthermore , black hole space  times containing infinitely thin cosmic strings have been investigated both for static black holes @xcite as well as for rotating black holes @xcite . in this case ,",
    "analytic solutions to the geodesic equation in terms of elliptic functions are possible .    in this paper",
    "we are aiming at understanding particle motion in the space  time of a finite width cosmic string .",
    "the underlying field theoretical model is the u(1 ) abelian  higgs model which has string  like solutions @xcite .",
    "the gravitational properties of abelian ",
    "higgs strings have also been studied in detail by minimally coupling the abelian  higgs model to gravity . far away from the core of the string",
    ", the space - time has a deficit angle , i.e. corresponds to minkowski space - time minus a wedge @xcite .",
    "the deficit angle is in linear order proportional to the energy per unit length of the string . if the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field is sufficiently large ( corresponding to very heavy strings that have formed at energies much bigger than the gut scale ) , the deficit angle becomes larger than @xmath0 .",
    "these solutions are the so - called `` supermassive strings '' studied in @xcite and possess a singularity at a maximal value of the radial coordinate , at which the angular part of the metric vanishes .",
    "interestingly , it was realized only a few years ago @xcite that both the globally regular string solution as well as the supermassive solution have `` shadow '' solutions that exist for the same parameter values .",
    "the string - like solutions with deficit angle @xmath1 have a shadow solution in the form of so - called melvin solutions , which have a different asymptotic behaviour of the metric and have higher energies than their string counterparts ( and are thus very likely cosmologically not relevant ) .",
    "the supermassive string solutions on the other hand have shadow solutions of kasner - type .",
    "kasner solutions possess also a singularity at some finite radial distance , the difference is that for kasner solutions , the @xmath2-component of the metric vanishes at this maximal radial distance , while the angular part of the metric diverges there . since both supermassive as well as kasner solutions contain space - time singularities they are surely of limited interest for cosmological applications . in this paper",
    "we thus concentrate on the motion of test particles in the space  time of a gravitating cosmic string that possesses a deficit angle @xmath1 .",
    "since the field theoretical solutions and in particular the metric functions can only be determined numerically analytic results are not possible for the geodesic equation .",
    "this is similar to the geodesic motion in the space  time of a gravitating magnetic monopole @xcite , where also only numerical results are possible .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we discuss the field theoretical model that possesses string  like solutions and we also give the geodesic equation . in section 3",
    "we discuss our numerical results , in particular we give examples of orbits and demonstrate how the ratio between the symmetry breaking scale as well as the ratio between the higgs and gauge boson mass influence our results .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "in the following we will first present the space  time of an abelian  higgs string and then give the geodesic equation that describes the motion of massless and massive test particles in the space  time of an abelian ",

    "note that when we talk about bound and escape orbits we are referring to the motion in the @xmath114@xmath115plane .",
    "the particles can , of course , move along the full @xmath17axis from @xmath116 to @xmath117 for @xmath118 .",
    "bound orbits are orbits on which test particles move from a minimal value of @xmath38 , @xmath119 to a maximal value of @xmath38 , @xmath120 and back again .",
    "these orbits have hence two turning points with @xmath121 . on escape orbits , on the other hand , particles come from @xmath122 , reach a minimal value of @xmath38 , @xmath119 and move back to @xmath122 , which means that escape orbits have only one turning point with @xmath121 . looking at ( [ eq1 ] ) it is obvious that turning points are located at those @xmath38 at which @xmath123 .    for all our numerical calculations we have chosen @xmath124 .",
    "the first observation is that since @xmath125 and @xmath126 there is always an infinite potential barrier at @xmath127 for @xmath128 which means that the particles can never reach the @xmath17-axis , i.e. @xmath129 . for @xmath130 this potential barrier disappears .",
    "moreover , in the bogomolny limit @xmath48 with @xmath58 the effective potential is monotonically decreasing from @xmath131 to @xmath132 and @xmath123 can only be fulfilled for one @xmath38 .",
    "hence in the bogomolny limit bound orbits do not exist and test particles can only move on escape orbits .",
    "this is different for @xmath133 where @xmath134 is non  constant .",
    "in fact , all our numerical results indicate that bound orbits exist only for @xmath55 and for massive particles ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "an indication that this is correct can be seen when looking at ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "bound orbits are possible whenever @xmath135 possesses at least one extremum , i.e. there is one finite @xmath38 for which @xmath136 . using the explicit form of the effective potential ( [ potential ] ) this gives @xmath137 assuming @xmath107 and @xmath108 to be positive , the right - hand side of ( [ extremum ] ) is always positive .",
    "in addition @xmath138 is always positive which can be seen from ( [ n2 ] ) and the fact that @xmath139 and @xmath140 . now from ( [ n2 ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath141 for some finite @xmath142 is excluded .",
    "hence , for extrema to exist we need to require that @xmath143 .",
    "in fact for @xmath55 we find that @xmath143 , while @xmath144 for @xmath54 ( see also the results in @xcite ) .",
    "of course , the requirement that @xmath145 does not guarantee that bound orbits exist ( this still depends on the choice of @xmath146 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) , but for @xmath144 , i.e. @xmath54 we can exclude the possibility of bound orbits .",
    "our numerical results demonstrating the change of the effective potential with @xmath28 and @xmath31 are shown in fig.[fignew1 ] . for fixed @xmath28",
    "it is obvious that local extrema exist for @xmath51 , while there are no extrema for @xmath147 .",
    "moreover , the potential changes only little for changing @xmath54 .    for fixed @xmath51 ( here @xmath148 ) local extrema do exist and the value of these extrema is enhanced with increasing gravitational coupling . for fixed @xmath54 ( here @xmath149 ) no extrema exist . while the effective potential possesses local extrema for @xmath51 bound orbits exist only for particular choices of @xmath146 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . as mentioned above ,",
    "our results indicate that bound orbits exist only for massive particles @xmath150 ) . in order to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "we show the effective potential for a massive and a massless test particle in fig.[fignew2 ] and fig.[fignew3 ] , respectively . it can be seen from fig.[fignew2 ] that the potential possesses local extrema and that @xmath146 intersects the potential twice for sufficiently low values of @xmath90 if @xmath89 .",
    "this is different for the massless case . as can been seen from fig.[fignew3 ] ,",
    "the local extrema of the effective potential disappear with decreasing @xmath90 such that when @xmath146 is comparable to the asymptotic value of the effective potential , there are no local extrema at all .",
    "hence , all our numerical results indicate that bound orbits for massless particles are excluded .    in the following we want to compare this result with the analytical result of @xcite , which states that for a general cosmic string space ",
    "time with topology @xmath153 massless test particles must move on geodesics that escape to infinity in both directions , i.e. closed geodesics are not possible .",
    "the assumption made in @xcite is that @xmath154 must have positive gaussian curvature . to show that @xmath154 has positive gaussian curvature in our case , we rewrite the metric ( [ metric ] ) for massless particles ( @xmath155 ) moving in a plane parallel to the @xmath114-@xmath115-plane as follows @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the so - called optical metric @xcite of which the spatial projection of geodesics of massless particles , i.e. light rays are geodesics .",
    "@xmath157 is the metric of the above mentioned 2-manifold @xmath154 and has gaussian curvature @xmath158 given by @xmath159 where in the second last equality we have used the einstein equations ( [ n1 ] ) , ( [ n2 ] ) with @xmath160 the energy density and @xmath161 the pressure in @xmath162-direction .",
    "note that ( [ gauss ] ) reduces to the relation found in @xcite if we use the assumptions made in that paper , i.e. @xmath163 and @xmath58 .    in the bps limit",
    "we know that @xmath164 and the gaussian curvature is obviously positive , away from the bps limit one has to use the numerical solution and compute the curvature .",
    "we find that for most values of @xmath31 and @xmath28 the gaussian curvature is indeed positive and our result is in agreement with that of @xcite .",
    "however , if the ratio between higgs and gauge boson mass is sufficiently large , we find that @xmath158 can become negative close to the string axis .",
    "our results are shown in fig.[gammabeta ] , where we present @xmath165 in dependence on @xmath31 .",
    "for @xmath166 the gaussian curvature @xmath158 can become negative for values of @xmath38 close to zero , while @xmath158 is strictly positive for @xmath167 .",
    "though the theorem of @xcite is not applicable here , we nevertheless find that bound orbits do not exist .    in fig.[fignew4",

    "moreover , the lower the value of @xmath91 the lower the value of the minimum of the potential .",
    "moreover , the potential barrier at @xmath129 disappears for @xmath130 .",
    "+   +     +    we have then investigated how the existence of escape and bound orbits depends on the choice of @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 . following the known discussion of orbits in the schwarzschild case @xcite",
    ", we define @xmath168 and @xmath169 . in fig.[munu](a ) we show the @xmath67@xmath170plane of a massive test particle for @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath171 and indicate for which values of @xmath67 and @xmath170 bound orbits exist .",
    "this is only possible in regions @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "the corresponding effective potential @xmath135 for regions m1-m4 is shown in fig.[domains ] . in region m1",
    "the effective potential @xmath135 is always larger than @xmath174 , so no particle motion is possible . in region",
    "m2 the potential has a local minimum and @xmath174 intersects @xmath135 twice .",
    "the intersection points correspond to the minimal and maximal radius of a bound orbit . in region",
    "m3 the potential has a local minimum and a local maximum and @xmath174 intersects @xmath135 three times .",
    "the two intersection points at smaller @xmath38 correspond to the minimal and maximal radius of a bound orbit , while the intersection point at larger @xmath38 corresponds to the minimal radius of an escape orbit .",
    "finally , in region m4 @xmath174 intersects @xmath135 once .",
    "this intersection point corresponds to the minimal radius of an escape orbit .",
    "as already mentioned the form of the effective potential will change with @xmath28 and @xmath31 .",
    "this leads then to a change of the @xmath67@xmath170plane which is indicated in fig.[munu](b)-(e ) , where we demonstrate how the regions m1-m4 change when changing either @xmath28 or @xmath31 .",

    "this is shown in fig.[munu](d)-(e ) .",
    "note that our results for @xmath118 are qualitatively similar , this is why we do nt discuss them in detail here .",
    "the main difference between @xmath171 and @xmath118 is that the particles move on 3dimensional orbits in the latter case , while their motion is restricted to the @xmath114@xmath115plane in the former .        in fig.[geo1]-[geo4 ] we show how bound and escape orbits of massive test particles @xmath175 change when changing @xmath28 and @xmath31 , respectively . in order to understand how the test particle moves",
    "we also indicate the radius of the scalar core ( red ) and of the magnetic flux tube core ( blue ) .",
    "since we measure the distance @xmath38 in units of @xmath176 the scalar core radius is given by @xmath177 and the magnetic flux tube core is given by @xmath178 .    from fig.[geo1 ] it is evident that the maximal radius of a bound orbit decreases strongly with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "while it is much larger than @xmath179 for @xmath180 , it becomes comparable to @xmath179 for @xmath181 and even smaller than @xmath179 for @xmath182 .",
    "this is related to the increased curvature of space ",
    "time for increasing @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the minimal radius of the escape orbit is always inside the magnetic flux tube core .",
    "hence , the particle does not only move in the exterior ( vacuum ) region of the cosmic string , but can enter into the scalar and flux tube cores .",
    "the change of a bound orbit with @xmath31 is shown in fig.[geo2 ] . the maximal radius of the bound orbit increases with increasing @xmath31 , while the radius of the scalar core @xmath179 decreases at the same time .",
    "this leads to the observation that for small @xmath31 the particle moves basically only inside the scalar core , while for increasing @xmath31 it moves further and further away from the cosmic string .    in fig.[geo3 ]",
    "we show how an escape orbit changes when changing the gravitational coupling @xmath28 . for @xmath183 and @xmath184",
    "the particle arrives from infinity , gets deflected by the cosmic string and moves again to infinity .",
    "the larger @xmath28 the bigger is the change in the direction of the motion of the particle .",
    "this is not suprising since the deficit angle @xmath74 increases with increasing @xmath28 .",
    "for @xmath185 we observe a new phenomenon .",
    "the particle arrives from infinity , encircles the cosmic string and then moves again to infinity .",
    "this is new as compared to a space  time of an infinitely thin string .",
    "however , this type of encirclement has already been observed in the space  time of a schwarzschild black hole and kerr black hole , respectively pierced by an infinitely thin cosmic string for sufficiently large deficit angle @xcite .",
    "comparing these results with those given in fig.[geo4 ] we observe that the encirclement disappears when increasing @xmath31 .",
    "while it is still present for @xmath151 , it has disappeared for @xmath48 and @xmath186 .",
    "it seems that massless particles can only move on escape orbits , i.e. bound orbits as the ones shown for massive particles are not possible .",
    "we show the change of an escape orbit with the gravitational coupling @xmath28 in fig.[mlesclzsqrt0030e0075pz0050lambda050vgamma ] . for sufficiently large @xmath28",
    "we observe that the massless test particle encircles the cosmic string before moving again to infinity .",
    "this is completely new as compared to the space  time of an infinitely thin cosmic string .",
    "the change of the orbit with @xmath31 is qualitatively similar to that of a massive particle .",
    "this is why we do nt present it here .",
    "we can calculate the perihelion shift of a planar ( @xmath171 ) bound orbit of a massive test particle ( @xmath89 ) by using ( [ neweq1 ] ) . the perihelion shift then reads @xmath187 where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the minimal and maximal radius of the bound orbit .",
    "our results for a particle with @xmath190 , @xmath191 and @xmath171 are shown in fig.[phld040506e1031lz0010pz00 ] , where the value of @xmath192 is given in dependence on the gravitational coupling @xmath28 for different values of @xmath31 .",
    "for this particular case , the perihelion shift is negative which means that the particle moves from @xmath188 to @xmath189 and back to @xmath188 under an angle of less than @xmath0 .",
    "though in most space  times the perihelion shift is positive it is not too suprising that it can become negative in our case since the space ",
    "time is conical .",
    "typically , the perihelion shift is negative for @xmath174 small , i.e. small values of the energy , while it becomes positive for larger values of @xmath174 .",
    "we observe that the value of the perihelion shift decreases for increasing @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , increasing the ratio @xmath31 between higgs and gauge boson mass increases the value of the perihelion shift .",
    "the deflection of light by a cosmic string can be calculated by using ( [ neweq1 ] ) for a planar ( @xmath171 ) escape orbit of a massless test particle ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the light deflection then reads @xmath193 where @xmath188 is the minimal radius of the orbit .",
    "our numerical results are shown in fig.[lidefld040506e1400lz0600pz00 ] , where we give the value of @xmath194 in dependence on the gravitational coupling @xmath28 for three different values of @xmath31 .",
    "apparently , light deflection becomes stronger when increasing @xmath28 which results from the increase of the deficit angle .",

    "higgs string .",
    "we find that the existence of bound orbits , i.e. orbits on which a particle moves between a finite maximal and finite minimal radius depends crucially on the choice of the ratio between the symmetry breaking scale and the planck mass and the choice of the ratio between the higgs and gauge boson mass . in this paper",
    ", we have only considered the case of small symmetry breaking scale ( in comparison to the planck mass ) , i.e. we have only taken space - times with deficit angle smaller than @xmath0 into account . moreover ,",
    "we have not studied melvin  type space  times which we believe are physically not relevant from a astrophysical / cosmological point of view .",
    "we observe that bound orbits are only possible if the test particle is massive and if the higgs boson mass is smaller than the gauge boson mass or in other words if the magnetic flux tube core lies inside the scalar core of the cosmic string .",
    "increasing either the ratio between the symmetry breaking scale and the planck mass or the ratio between the higgs and gauge boson mass the particles move closer and closer around the string core .",
    "in fact , they move inside both the scalar and flux tube core and are not restricted to the movement inside the vacuum region outside both cores . for massless particles , which can only move on escape orbits , we observe a new phenomenon as compared to the space  time of an infinitely thin cosmic string : the particles can encircle the string before moving again to infinity",
    ".    the perihelion shift of bound orbits of massive particles can be either negative or positive depending on the particle s energy and decreases with increasing ratio between symmetry breaking scale and planck mass .",
    "moreover , it increases with increasing higgs to gauge boson mass ratio .",
    "the light deflection by a cosmic string increases with both the ratio between symmetry breaking scale and planck mass and the ratio between higgs and gauge boson mass .",
    "since one of the possible detections of cosmic strings would be by light deflection ( i.e. gravitational lensing ) our results can be used to compare possible observational data to make predictions about the symmetry breaking scale at which the cosmic string formed as well as about the ratio between the corresponding higgs and gauge boson mass of the underlying field theory .",
    "it would also be interesting to study geodesic motion in the space  time of a semilocal string @xcite , which is a solution of the electroweak model with gauge group su(2)@xmath195 u(1 ) in the limit where the weinberg angle @xmath196 . moreover , field theoretical models describing so ",
    "called @xmath197@xmath198strings have been studied recently @xcite .",
    "@xmath197@xmath198strings are supersymmetric bound states of @xmath199 and @xmath200strings and provide one of the examples of strings that might have formed in inflationary models resulting from string theory .",
    "understanding how test particles move in the space  time of these strings would provide a further possibility to detect them .",
