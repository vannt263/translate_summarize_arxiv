    "an accurate description of the inclusive antiproton production cross section in proton - nucleus collisions , necessarily relies on the empirical approach to the experimental data since theoretical calculations can provide at best approximate values in the current stage of the theory .",
    "the aim of the present work was to develop a handy analytical parameterization for the description of the inclusive production cross section in proton - proton ( @xmath4 ) and proton - nucleus ( @xmath5 ) collisions on the basis of the existing body of data , updating the former works on the subject .",
    "the motivations of the work have their origin in the needs of cosmic ray ( cr ) physics where a good knowledge and a good description of the inclusive production cross section is a key requirement for a detailed understanding of the production and propagation of secondary galactic and atmospheric antiprotons .",
    "the @xmath0 component of the cr flux is an important window for cosmology .",
    "the main contribution to this flux originates from the interaction of the high energy cr flux with the interstellar matter ( ism ) in the galaxy .",
    "these are called secondary galactic .",
    "in addition to the secondary products , a primary component could exist , undergone for example , by the dark matter neutralino annihilation @xcite or by the evaporation products of primordial black holes @xcite , both being of major physical and astrophysical interest .",
    "such signatures could be obtained only if the basic processes of galactic and atmospheric @xmath0 production cross section in @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions are known with a good enough accuracy over a momentum range extending from around threshold up to a few hundreds of gev where the cr flux becomes vanishingly small .",
    "the approach used here closely follows the forms used by kalinovskii , mokhov and nikitin @xcite  referred to as kmn in the following  for the description of the @xmath6 cross section .",
    "the functional form used in this reference has been modified in order to reproduce a much larger sample of data sets over a much larger dynamical range and for a larger range of nuclear mass , than in the original work .",
    "this work extends a previous effort covering a more limited domain of incident momentum and of nuclear mass @xcite .",
    "in high energy hadron collisions the final state is often complex , many particles being produced in the collision .",
    "the inclusive single particle production cross section is a quantity of interest in many physics studies , for a reaction @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the particle of interest and where @xmath9 represents all the other particles produced in any quantum final state allowed in the collision .",
    "the invariant inclusive single particle distribution is defined by : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the triple differential cross section for detecting particle @xmath8 within the phase - space volume element @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the total energy of @xmath8 , while @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the longitudinal and transverse components of @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the rapidity variable @xmath17 is often used to describe the @xmath14 dependence of the cross section because of its interesting properties in lorentz transformations @xcite . to obtain two last expression in ( [ eq1 ] ) ,",
    "an azimuthal symmetry of the differentiel cross section was used .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the following dimensionless variables : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the feynman scaling variable and @xmath20 the radial scaling variable ( which depends only on the radial distance from the kinematic boundary @xcite ) , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the longitudinal momentum of the particle and its maximum possible value in the center of mass ( @xmath23 ) frame respectively , while similarly @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the total energy of the inclusive particle and its maximum possible value in the @xmath23 frame respectively .",
    "the latter can written as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the minimum possible mass of the recoiling particle in the considered process and @xmath28 the total @xmath23 energy .",
    "note that for any nuclear collision , the kinematical variables used here will always be expressed in the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath29 ) rather than in the nucleon - nucleus @xmath23 frame , since the @xmath29 @xmath23 frame is the relevant physical system , the incident nucleon energies being on the scale of 10  gev while the average binding energy of the nucleon in the nucleus is about 8 mev .",
    "bound nucleons can be considered as free particles for the incident protons .",
    "a parameterization of the inclusive production cross section can be guided by some general phenomenological features of hadron collisions ( see @xcite for the general physics context ) .    *",
    "all experimental hadronic production cross sections show a strong exponential decrease in transverse momentum , the exponential slope being more or less incident energy and recoil mass @xmath30 dependent . * hadronic scaling : the inclusive distribution @xmath31 of particle @xmath8 , is to a good approximation , a function only on @xmath15 and @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) at the high energy limit @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , a large number of slow particles is produced ( low @xmath19 values ) , the distribution decreasing rapidly to zero as @xmath33 , like @xmath34 .",
    "this form can be explained by the counting rules in parton model . + these features are predicted qualitatively by the regge poles phenomenology and the parton model . * for a given @xmath15 , the inclusive distribution of produced particles is ( to a good approximation for @xmath5 collisions ) symmetric in the rapidity space with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the rapidity of the @xmath23 in the laboratory frame ( lab ) , or in the @xmath23 frame @xmath37 .",
    "a forward - backward symmetry of the cross section is expected from first principles ( symmetry of the wave function and of the interaction ) for the @xmath29 system ( in @xmath5 collisions however , the absorption of low energy particles in the nuclear medium may distort the natural symmetry ) . in the central region where @xmath38 , the inclusive distribution consists of a plateau which width increases slowly with the incident energy .",
    "this plateau reduces to a simple maximum over the energy range considered here .",
    "the inclusive distribution rises again in the fragmentation region where @xmath39 for particles which can be produced diffractively but it is not the case for @xmath0 and the inclusive distribution falls simply in the fragmentation region .",
    "following the approach proposed in @xcite , the former phenomenological features of hadron collisions have been used to constrain the parameters of a functional form describing the inclusive production cross section , which could reproduce all the relevant experimental data available from @xmath4 and @xmath5 collisions .",
    "the data used are listed in table  [ dataa ] .",
    "the measurements on nuclear targets cover basically the whole range of nuclear mass , from proton to lead , over a range of incident energies from 12  gev up to 400  gev , matching the useful range for cr studies .",
    "the kmn parameterization used previously @xcite is in very poor agreement with the data listed in table  [ dataa ] , and a reexamination of the analytical approach , better constrained by recent data was necessary . the larger incident energy domain used here required some energy dependence to be introduced in the parameterization following the general features described above as ( loose ) guidelines .    in this study",
    ", the @xmath0 inclusive cross section will be expressed as a function of the three variables , @xmath28 , @xmath15 and @xmath20 ( see for example @xcite for the relevance of the choice of these variables ) : @xmath41 the following functional form used to describe the @xmath0 production cross section is an evolved version of the kmn formula : @xmath42 \\label{eq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the target mass .",
    "the total inelastic cross section @xmath44 for @xmath5 collisions was borrowed from @xcite : @xmath45\\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma _ { 0}\\left ( mb\\right )   & = & 45a^{0.7}\\left [ 1 + 0.016\\sin \\left(5.3 - 2.63\\ln a\\right ) \\right ] \\label{eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the incident kinetic energy in mev .",
    "the 10 parameters @xmath47-@xmath48 have been fitted to the set of experimental data listed in table  [ dataa ] by a standard @xmath49 minimization procedure using the code _ minuit _ @xcite .    in relation ( [ eq4 ] ) , the term @xmath50 originates from the hadronic scaling properties , namely , the quark counting rules of the parton model of hadronic interactions @xcite ( see sect .  [ feat ] ) .",
    "it was found empirically in this study , that a significantly better result is obtain if the exponent is energy dependent .",
    "the @xmath51 factor multiplying the @xmath52 coefficient was found to give the best result .",
    "the term @xmath53 is induced by the regge regime @xcite .",
    "the last factor of relation  ( [ eq4 ] ) accounts for the transverse momentum dependence of the cross section ( see sect .  [ feat ] ) .",
    "the analysis of the experimental data ( table  [ dataa ] ) showed that the term of angular dependence @xmath54 is dominant at low energy , @xmath55gev , while the term @xmath56 dominates at high energies , @xmath57gev .",
    "the @xmath28 dependence has been introduced to allow the transition from the @xmath15 to the @xmath58 dependence .",
    "the target mass dependence was accounted for by the factor @xmath59 , with an energy dependent exponent introduced for the same reason as above , at variance with the constant exponent used in the kmn parameterization .",
    "the energy dependence used ( linear in @xmath28 ) accounts for the experimental increase of this coefficient with the incident energy found using the kmn approach . for incident energies",
    "@xmath60gev , this coefficient becomes negative .",
    "experimental production cross section for @xmath61 collisions at 23.1 gev/@xmath8 and at 0 degree scattering angle @xcite compared with the parameterization ( [ eq4 ] ) , plotted against particle momentum @xmath62 ( left ) , and rapidity @xmath63 ( right ) . in this latter case the distribution is symmetric around the value of the @xmath23 rapidity @xmath64 , corresponding to @xmath65 gev/@xmath8 in the lab .",
    "the fit to the cross section data in the upper @xmath66 region of the momentum region also determines the values of the cross section for @xmath67 where no data is available.,width=340 ]    in sect .",
    "2 , it was mentioned that one of the features of the inclusive distribution is its symmetry in the rapidity space . by construction our parameterization ( relation ( [ eq4 ] ) ) satisfies this symmetry property since it depends only on @xmath28 , @xmath15 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[figure1 ] which shows the fit to the 23.1  gev/@xmath8 cross section data versus particle rapidity ( right ) and particle momentum ( left ) .",
    "the maximum of the cross section corresponds to particle production with velocity zero in the @xmath23 frame , i.e. , traveling with the @xmath23 velocity in the laboratory .",
    "the corresponding value of this momentum in the lab is : @xmath68 .",
    "since the cross section distribution is symmetric in the rapidity space , the upper branch of rapidity with respect to the @xmath36 , completely determines the values of cross section along the lower branch .",
    "this is true as well in the lab frame where the values of the cross section for @xmath69 determine the values below this momentum . in the case of the figure",
    "this means that a fit to the experimental values of the cross section above @xmath70  gev/@xmath8 also determines the values of the cross section below with the same level of accuracy .",
    "fitting the data from about @xmath71  2.1 up to @xmath71  3.2 , also determines the cross section down to @xmath71  0.65 , i.e. , down to @xmath72  0.65  gev / c , the validity of the fit extending likely significantly below this value .",
    "this is an important point since experimental cross section data are usually scarce below about 1  gev , and since the production cross section for these low energy particles is very important because originating from neutralino ( dark - matter ) annihilation @xcite or from the evaporation of primordial black holes @xcite , are expected within this energy range .",

    "[ figure10],width=340 ]    this reaction is the dominant contribution to the secondary @xmath0 production induced by cosmic rays , since the interstellar gas is mainly constituted of hydrogen gas .",
    "it is thus important to obtain as accurate a description as possible for the cross section .",
    "considering separately the @xmath74 collision data in table  [ dataa ] , the parameterization ( [ eq4 ] ) gives for the best fit a value of the @xmath73 per point of 7.08 .",
    "for the same data , the well known parameterization of tan and ng @xcite gives a value of 28.1 .",
    "in addition , this latter parameterization is valid only for @xmath75 gev/@xmath8 and is not able to reproduce the large @xmath15 data such as those from @xcite and @xcite where @xmath76gev/@xmath8 .",
    "note also that tan and ng s parameterization contains 8 parameters for @xmath77  gev @xmath78  gev/@xmath8 ) and 17 for @xmath79  gev .",
    "however , in the course of the study , it appeared that some of the parameters of relation  ( [ eq4 ] ) had no incidence on the resulting fits .",
    "the parameterization ( [ eq4 ] ) has then been revisited and simplified from some of its parameters irrelevant for this particular reaction and from other parameters which turned out to be ineffective in the minimization procedure , resulting in the following functional form for @xmath80 inclusive production cross section : @xmath81 \\label{eq6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in comparison with relation ( [ eq4 ] ) , the dependence with the mass of the target has been removed since the only proton target is considered in this case .",
    "in addition , the energy dependent factors @xmath28 in front of @xmath82 and @xmath83 in ( [ eq4 ] ) have been also removed because of their ineffectiveness in the minimization procedure .",
    "the parameters @xmath82 to @xmath83 have been adjusted by the same @xmath73 minimization procedure as previously @xcite , to the set of experimental data listed in table  [ dataa ] restricted to @xmath4 collisions . with formula ( [ eq6 ] ) ,",
    "the @xmath73 per point obtained for the best fit is 3.59 , for 228 experimental point , instead of 7.08 with relation ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the values of the fit parameters obtained with ( [ eq6 ] ) are given in table  [ para2 ] .",
    "the correlation coefficients between the parameters determined in the search are given in appendix .",
    "note that the values of the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively , are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this was expected since they describe the same physics in the relations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "[ figure9 ] and [ figure10 ] show the @xmath80 data analyzed , compared with the best fit results obtained for the whole @xmath4 and @xmath5 data sets from table  [ dataa ] , using relation  ( [ eq4 ] ) ( dashed line ) and with those obtained for the @xmath4 data only using relation  ( [ eq6 ] ) ( solid line ) .",
    "the simplified form ( [ eq6 ] ) clearly provides a significantly better account of the measured cross sections , the @xmath73 value obtained being better by a factor of about 2 ( about 3.6 against about 7 ) .",
    "the results obtained in this work have been used in the calculations of the @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 production from @xmath74 and @xmath90 collisions in the atmosphere and in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "in this section , the antiproton mean multiplicity , defined as @xmath91 and depending only on @xmath28 , has been computed by means of relations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) and compared with the experimental data in @xmath4 collision @xcite .",
    "note that the original data from @xcite have been corrected from the single - diffractive contribution to the total inelastic cross section @xmath92 @xcite .",

    "note that below @xmath94  15 gev/@xmath8 , the results given by the relation ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) become significantly different ( about a factor 2 at the maximum ) .",
    "as expected , the simplified form ( [ eq6 ] ) gives a little bit better results since the experimental data are from @xmath4 collisions .",
    "the parameterization of the inclusive production cross section on nuclei has been revisited by investigating a broad collection of data sets available , covering a large dynamical domain of incident energy and of momentum transfer , for a broad range of nuclear masses .",
    "good results have been obtained but for a small sample of data sets inconsistent with the other data .",
    "the experimental inclusive production cross sections can be reproduced to within a few tens of percent over this range , i.e. , for incident energies from 12  gev up to 400  gev , and for target mass @xmath95 .",
    "theses results constitute a significant improvement with respect to the former kmn parameterization , decreasing by a factor of about 15 the value of the @xmath73 per point obtained using the latter .",
    "a simplified version of the functional form has been developed for @xmath4 collisions giving also good results up to very high energies , much beyond the range dictated by the cosmic ray physics requirements which motivated the study .",
    "this also constitutes an improvement , consistent with the data on nuclei , of the tan and ng formula used so far as a standard in the calculations .",
    "the parameterisations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) are also able to reproduce the experimental antiproton mean multiplicity measured in @xmath4 collision with a good accuracy .",
    "a point to be emphasized is that because of the symmetry of the cross section in the rapidity space , the fitted range in the lab momentum of the particle , usually measured above the @xmath23 rapidity , also determines the cross section at low momenta , a range of major importance for cosmic ray antiprotons where accuracy is extremely important .",
    "the authors are grateful to michael murray for helpful discussions on the na44 data .",
    "the symmetrical matrix ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) give respectively the correlation coefficients for the parameters @xmath47@xmath96@xmath48 and @xmath82@xmath96@xmath83 of equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) respectively .    in relation ( [ eq4 ] ) , the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath97 appear to be strongly correlated ( correlation coefficient 0.961 ) , as it could be expected from their functional dependence . on the contrary ,",
    "coefficient @xmath85 and @xmath98 are not correlated ( correlation coefficient 0.232 ) , since effective in different energy ranges ( see sect .",
