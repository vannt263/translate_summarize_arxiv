    "the linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method in the atomic - spheres approximation ( asa ) @xcite has been used for over three decades as an _ ab initio _",
    "method for electronic - structure calculations .",
    "one of the defining characteristics of this method is its small , localized @xcite basis set which provides highly efficient computation and does not require crystalline symmetry @xcite .",
    "equally important is the fact that the similarity of lmtos to atomic orbitals makes the method physically transparent .",
    "this means that it is easy to extract _",
    "e.g. _ information about the nature of chemical bonds , the symmetry of band states , a.s.o ..    the extreme speed and simplicity of the lmto - asa is to a large extent due to the asa which takes the one - electron potential and charge density to be spherically symmetric inside space - filling wigner - seitz spheres whose overlap is neglected .",
    "this approximation is very good , not only for closely - packed solids but also for open systems in which the interstital sites have high symmetry and can be taken as centers for `` empty '' wigner - seitz spheres containing no protons but only electrons .",
    "the diamond structure is such a case , because both its potential and charge density are are approximately spherical inside equal - sized spheres packed on a body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice .",
    "however , for open systems with atoms of different sizes and/or with low symmetry , it can be cumbersome , if not impossible to find a good asa .    since most systems of current interest are low - dimensional and multi - component , and since the cost of computation has followed moors law for decades , the lmto - asa method is now mainly used to extract information about the electrons from accurate calculations which use one of the plane - wave supercell methods .",
    "these methods employ the variational principle with large plane - wave basis sets , either for the full - potential schrdinger equation with linear augmented plane waves ( lapws ) @xcite or projector - augmented plane waves ( paws ) @xcite , or for a pseudopotential with straight plane waves @xcite . in this mode of operation ,",
    "one adjusts the lmto - asa sphere sizes and empty - sphere positions by trial and error such as to obtain the best possible agreement with the band structure obtained with an accurate method .",
    "attempts _ have _ been made to improve the accuracy while preserving the desirable features of the lmto - asa .",
    "first @xcite , it was realized that the multiple - scattering method of korringa , kohn and rostoker ( kkr ) @xcite , the mother of all mto methods , solves schrdingers equation not only for a mt potential , that is a potential which is spherically symmetric inside non - overlapping spheres and flat ( @xmath10 in between , but also for a _ superposition _ of spherically symmetric potential - wells to 1st order in their overlap , with _ no _ change of the formalism .",
    "this explained why the asa had worked much better than the mt approximation ( mta ) and begged for the use of even larger potential spheres . the overlapping muffin - tin approximation ( omta ) , however , turned out _ not _ to work with conventional lmtos because the energy - dependence of their envelope functions , the decaying hankel functions , had not been linearized away in the same way as the energy - dependence of the augmenting partial waves inside the spheres , but put to a constant ( e.g.@xmath2=@xmath3)@xmath4 as a consequence , _ exact _ mtos ( emtos ) with envelopes of energy - dependent , screened solutions of the wave equation had to be found , and then linearized @xcite . with the resulting , so - called 3rd - generation lmtos ( lmto3s ) , it became possible to solve schrdingers equation for diamond - structured silicon using the omta without empty spheres @xcite .",
    "specifically , the asa potential calculated self - consistently _ with _ empty spheres ( and the 14% radial overlap of bcc ws spheres ) was least - squares fitted to a superposition of potential wells centered only on the si sites , whereafter schrdingers equation was solved for this omta potential with the lmto3 method . by varying the omta overlap , a minimum rms error of 80 mev per valence - band electron was found around 30% overlap : for smaller overlaps the omta - fit was worse , and for larger overlaps the @xmath5nd - order overlap error of the lmto3 method dominated .",
    "this ability of the lmto3 method to compute the band structure for an omta potential was not developed into a charge - selfconsistent method , despite several attempts rashmicatia , unpubl , but for the emto greens-function method this was done by vitos et al . who devised a spherical - cell approximation for closely - packed alloys and demonstrated its efficiency for overlaps around @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "instead , the unique ability of the lmto3 method to generate super - minimal basis sets through downfolding was explored , but that led to the next problem : the smaller the basis set , the longer the range of each mto , and the stronger its energy dependence .",
    "for very small basis sets , this energy dependence may be so strong that linearization is insufficient .",
    "that problem was finally solved through the development of a polynomial approximation of general order @xmath7 in the mto hilbert space , and the resulting @xmath0mto method @xcite has now been in use for nearly ten years , in particular for generating few - orbital , low - energy hamiltonians in studies of correlated electron systems , but always in connection with potentials generated by the lmto - asa .    here , we shall present and apply the least - squares formalism to fit a full potential in the form delivered by any augmented plane - wave method to the omta form .",
    "this procedure is demonstrated for diamond - structured silicon , first by comparison of the full with the omta potential , and then by comparison of the full - potential lapw and omta @xmath0mto band structures .",
    "our current strategy for extracting electronic information from an accurate plane - wave calculation , is thus to fit its output potential to the omta and then perform @xmath0mto calculations for the omta potential .",
    "this procedure is more simple and accurate than going via the lmto - asa .",
    "in this section we shall explain the least - squares procedure for obtaining the omta to a full potential . in the first two subsections we shall present the general formulas @xcite , and in the last we shall present results for the specific analytic form of the full potential provided by an augmented plane - wave method .",
    "we wish to minimize the value of mean squared deviation,@xmath8 ^{2}d% \\mathbf{r , }   \\label{eq : mean_sq_dev}\\]]of the the full potential , @xmath9 from its omta counterpart , @xmath10 .",
    "the spherically symmetric potential wells @xmath11 vanish for @xmath12 and are centered at the sites @xmath13 of the atoms .",
    "@xmath14 is the ( cell ) volume . to be determined",
    "are thus the radial functions @xmath15 and the constant @xmath16 for given @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "variation of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath21 leads to the equation : @xmath23where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the averages of the respective functions over the sphere centered at site @xmath26 and of radius @xmath27 .",
    "( [ eq : func_diff_f ] ) thus translates into the requirement that the spherical averages of @xmath28 and @xmath29 around site @xmath26 be the same .",
    "the problem of calculating @xmath24 for the lapw potential will be addressed in sec .",
    "sec : flapw_sph_avg . by reordering of the terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : func_diff_f ] ) , and evaluating the spherical averages , we obtain:@xmath30 ,   \\label{eq : f_equation}\\]]where @xmath31 is the distance between respective sites .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath32 i.e. that a potential sphere never includes the center of another sphere ( moderate overlap ) . repeating the procedure for all inequivalent sites ,",
    "eq.s ( [ eq : f_equation ] ) become a set of _ _  linear integral equations _ _ which may be solved for a given @xmath33 by self - consistent iteration .",
    "the iteration can be initiated _ _",
    "e.g. _ _ by taking @xmath34 on the right - hand side of eq.@xmath2([eq : f_equation ] ) .",
    "a similar expression is obtained for the optimal value of the constant @xmath35 , namely : @xmath36where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the volume averages of the respective functions : @xmath39just like before , eq .  ( [ eq : g_opt ] ) expresses the condition of equality of averages of the full and omta potentials .",
    "we need to solve the _ coupled _ @xmath40 and @xmath35 equations .",
    "since these are linear , we may use the superposition principle to obtain:@xmath41where the `` structure functions '' @xmath42 are the solutions of the @xmath40-equations ( [ eq : f_equation ] ) for @xmath43 the optimal @xmath35-value is thus:@xmath44      the procedure outlined in section sec : f - equation requires calculation of the volume average @xmath45 and the spherical averages , @xmath46 for @xmath47 around all inequivalent sites of the full potential .",
    "this task can be achieved with relative ease thanks to the analytical form of the potential delivered by an augmented plane - wave method : space is divided into a set of atom - centered , _ non_-overlapping augmentation spheres with radii , @xmath48 and the interstitial . inside an augmentation",
    "sphere the full potential is given by the spherical - harmonics @xmath49 expansion:@xmath50where @xmath51 in the interstitial , the full potential is described as a linear combination of plane waves which we shall let extend throughout space:@xmath52the first term here provides the augmentation of the plane waves , i.e. it ads expression ( [ eq : flapw_mt ] ) and subtracts the corresponding plane - wave part inside the spheres .",

    "in this section we shall compare the potential and band structure calculated self - consistently using the full potential lapw method as implemented in wien2k @xcite with respectively the omta to this full potential and its band structure calculated using the @xmath0mto - omta method .",
    "as in the previous ( ae)sa-_vs_-omta lmto3 study @xcite , in the present full-_vs_-omta @xmath0mto study we choose diamond - structured si and omtas with atom - centered spherical wells in order that the study be relevant for open structures in general .",
    "[ fig : pot_fig ] compares the full potential with its omta for radial overlaps , @xmath78 of 10 , 30 , and 60% .",
    "we see a marked improvement in the quality of the fit as the overlap , i.e. the range of @xmath79 increases . with @xmath80 overlap",
    "the omta follows the full potential not only inside the potential wells , _",
    "i.e. _ close to the nuclei where the spherical approximation is at its best , but also along the bond between the si atoms and in the interstitial space .      from this",
    ", one might believe that it is always preferential to use large overlaps .",
    "but this is not so , because multiple - scattering methods are only `` self - correcting '' to 1st - order in the potential overlap ( @xmath81 @xcite . for large overlaps ,",
    "the errors of higher order ( @xmath82 and higher ) outweigh the effect of the improved description of the potential .",
    "we thus expect that there exists an optimal value of the overlap which yields the best accuracy of the calculated band states . in fig .  2 this",
    "is confirmed by explicit calculations of root mean squared ( rms ) error of the @xmath0mto - omta bands with respect to their full - potential lapw counterparts as a function of the radial overlap .",
    "the two curves are for respectively the four valence and the four lowest conduction bands . for both types of bands ,",
    "the error initially decreases as a result of the improved omta . for the valence bands the optimum of 3@xmath83mry / band = 20  mev / electron is reached at @xmath84 overlap , after which the error increases sharply , whereas for the conduction bands the optimum of 50  mev / e is reached at @xmath85 , wherafter the multiple - scattering errors increase slowly .",
    "this difference in behaviour is due to the valence states being bonding and the conduction states antibonding , whereby the former probe the overlap region more than the latter . whereas the rms - error curve for the conduction band is nicely flat , that of the valence band is _ not . _",
    "[ fig : bands ] shows the full - potential lapw band structure and the @xmath0mto band structures for the three omta potentials in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot_fig ] .",
    "excellent agreement is achieved with @xmath84 overlap for both conduction and valence bands . for smaller overlaps ,",
    "the @xmath0mto - omta bands lie to high , the valence bands in particular , and for larger overlaps they lie too low .",
    "the first point follows from the variational principle and the second from the fact that the multiple - scattering error @xmath82 is negative definite .",
    "this was explained in the previous study @xcite , which also demonstrated the use of various corrections .",
    "the simplest of these is to remove the _",
    "mean _ error of the energies for a group of bands , say the valence bands , by weighting the squared deviation in eq.@xmath2eq : mean_sq_dev with the charge density of those bands , and then keep the weighting in the @xmath35-equation only ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : g - equation ] ) . since the lapw valence charge density has the same form as the full potential , implementation of this requires use of formulas given in sect .",
    "sec : flapw_sph_avg .",
    "this correction will move the @xmath0mto - omta bands down by the appropriate amount for small overlaps and , hence , considerably lower the rms - error curve for small overlaps .",
    "an elegant correction of the large - overlap errors remains to be found ; the straight - forward but clumsy one is to evaluate the kinetic energy properly in the overlap region for the @xmath0mto basis .    mto - omta method for @xmath86 , 30 , and 60% radial overlap ( full ) . the @xmath0mto basis set consisted of the 9 @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 si-@xmath0mtos with the @xmath40s downfolded and had @xmath0=2 with expansion energies -0.5 , 0.3 , and 0.6  ry @xcite . ]        o.k .",
