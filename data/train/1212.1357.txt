    "mid - infrared ( mir ) spectra of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are dominated by the emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7@xmath1 m , commonly called the unidentified infrared ( uir ) bands ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the spectra of agn also present prominent molecular hydrogen and forbidden emission lines @xcite , as well as silicate bands at @xmath0 9.7@xmath1 m and 18@xmath1 m , both in emission and/or absorption .",
    "the absence of pah emission close to the central engine of active galaxies has been attributed to the destructive effects of highly energetic uv photons ( h@xmath1040ev ) supplied by the active nucleus and , therefore , the presence of these features have been mostly used as a tracer of massive star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "recently , @xcite showed that a large fraction ( @xmath1170% ) of seyfert galaxies shows bright pah emission lines , and demonstrated that pahs in agn present higher ionisation fraction and larger molecules ( @xmath11 180 carbon atoms ) than in starburst galaxies .",
    "the unified model of agns proposes the existence of a dense concentration of absorbing material surrounding the central engine in a toroidal distribution , which blocks the broad line region ( blr ) from the line of sight in seyfert 2 ( sy2 ) galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the t - recs slit position crosses the soft x - ray source s1 and diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "we extracted 7 one dimensional spectra spaced four pixels or 036 ( @xmath026 pc ) along the slit : one centred in the unresolved nucleus , and six extractions centred at 26pc , 52pc , and 78pc to the northeast ( ne ) and southwest ( sw ) directions .",

    "the similarity between the luminosity profile of the pah emission bands , ionic line and continuum suggests that the same mechanism dominates the excitation of both ionic and pah bands .",
    "@xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the pah bands in a sample of reflection nebulae , hii regions , young star objects , evolved stars and galaxies can show different profiles , which they proceeded to classify based on their shape and peak position into three classes .",
    "the @xmath3 class has the peak shifted to the blue , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 would show the peak centred and shifted to the red , respectively .",
    "according to these authors , hii regions , non - isolated herbig aebe stars and young stellar objects generally can be classified as @xmath3 class for all @xmath24 m pah emission features .",
    "their galaxy sample shows the same profile as the hii regions ( @xmath3 class ) except for the 11.3@xmath1 m profile , which resembles that of some evolved stars ( @xmath22 class ) .",
    "they also point out that most planetary nebulae and post - asymptotic giant branch stars belong to the second group ( @xmath22 class ) and just two peculiar post - asymptotic giant branch stars form a third class ( @xmath23 class * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite do not analyse the pah line profiles in the agns environment .",
    "these authors have been attributed the pah different profiles to differences in the physical conditions , composition of the pah family and/or the accumulated effect of processing in the regions where the emission originates ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , other authors propose that the trends in the pah band line profiles and intensities are a function of the pah molecules size , charge , geometry , and heterogeneity @xcite .    in order to investigate the pah profiles using high spatial resolution ( @xmath026pc ) of the seyfert ngc1808",
    ", we isolate the pah emission subtracting a general and local continuum under the 8.6@xmath1 m and 11.3@xmath1 m bands , using the same procedures of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figures [ 8profile ] and [ 11profile ] show the 8.6@xmath1 m and 11.3@xmath1 m pah profiles from our data , compared to representative pah profiles of the @xmath3 and @xmath22 @xcite classes .",
    "in general , the 8.6@xmath1 m and 11.3@xmath1 m pah emission line profiles in ngc1808 resemble peeters @xmath3 class . however , the 26pc sw and 26pc ne 8.6@xmath1 m pah profiles are wider than the representative @xmath3 class example , and also shifted to shorter wavelengths .",
    "comparison with the theoretical models from @xcite would suggest that the excess emission in the blue wing of the 8.6@xmath1 m line profile is evidence that the off - nuclear regions at 26pc sw and 26pc ne contain more ionised pah material than the nuclear region in this galaxy .",
    "the same conclusion can be derived from the equivalent width of the 8.6@xmath1 m assuming that this line is emitted by ionized pah molecules ( see * ? ? ?",
    "[ 11profile ] shows that the 11.3@xmath1 m pah profile from the 26pc sw spectrum is broader towards shorter wavelengths than the representative @xmath3 class .",
    "according to @xcite , the emission creating the shorter wavelengths of the 11.3@xmath1 m profile would be produced mainly by neutral pah molecules , and we would conclude that the amount of neutral emitting pah material in the 26pc sw region is larger than in the ngc1808 centre .",
    "the same conclusion can be derived from the equivalent width of the 11.3@xmath1 m assuming that this line is emitted by neutral pah molecules ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we can see from the values in the table  [ lines1 ] that the equivalent width ( ew ) of the pah at 8.6@xmath1 m , which is due to the ionized pahs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , is larger at 26pc sw extraction , while the largest ew of the neutral pahs ( see references above)is at 26pc ne extraction . in summary , the comparison of the observed pah profiles and their ews with the existing observational and theoretical studies indicate that at 26pc sw of the nucleus in ngc1808 , the ratio of ionised to neutral pah molecules is larger ( 1.3 ) than in the nuclear region ( 0.96 ) . on the other hand , the ew ratio of ionised to neutral pah is smallest , ew11.3@xmath1m / ew8.6@xmath1m@xmath00.7 , at 26pc ne suggesting that this region has more pahs in the neutral ionization stage .",
    "interestingly , the region hosting more ionised pah coincides with the @xmath25 x - ray source of @xcite , while the side hosting more neutral molecules coincides with the extended diffuse x - ray emission ( see fig .  [ fenda ] ) .",
    "overall , the asymmetry in the pah profiles correlates with regions associated with soft x - ray emission ( e@xmath26kev ) .",
    "our data make it quite evident that the 8.6@xmath1 m and 11.3@xmath1 m pah emission ( from ionised and neutral molecules ) are present in regions of soft and hard x - ray emission , as well as near to the active nucleus itself ( r @xmath2730pc ) .",
    "this immediately implies that both ionised and neutral pah molecules are surviving in the hard x - ray radiation field of the agn , as predicted if a dusty structure , such as the putative torus in the agn unified model , is present to partially block the strong radiation field from the central black hole .",
    "in this context , it is an interesting issue to investigate if the nuclear spectrum of ngc1808 present evidence of dusty torus that would explain the presence of pah molecules near to the active nucleus .",
    "the presence of a nuclear dusty toroidal structure , mainly composed by silicate and graphite grains , leaves unmistakable signatures in the observed seds of agn .",
    "while the sublimation of the graphite grains creates ir emission at @xmath28 m , the @xmath09.7@xmath1 m feature observed in emission / absorption is attributed to silicate grains ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "<S> we present mid infrared ( mir ) spectra of the seyfert 2 ( sy  2 ) galaxy ngc1808 , obtained with the gemini s thermal - region camera spectrograph ( t - recs ) at a spatial resolution of @xmath026pc . </S>",
    "<S> the high spatial resolution allowed us to detect bright polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) emissions at 8.6@xmath1 m and 11.3@xmath1 m in the galaxy centre ( @xmath026pc ) up to a radius of 70pc from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra also present [ neii]12.8@xmath1 m ionic lines , and h@xmath2(2)12.27@xmath1 m molecular gas line . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the pahs profiles are similar to peeters s @xmath3 class , with the line peak shifted towards the blue . </S>",
    "<S> the differences in the pah line profiles also suggests that the molecules in the region located 26pc ne of the nucleus are more in the neutral than in the ionised state , while at 26pc sw of the nucleus , the molecules are mainly in ionised state . </S>",
    "<S> after removal of the underlying galaxy contribution , the nuclear spectrum can be represented by a nenkova s clumpy torus model , indicating that the nucleus of ngc1808 hosts a dusty toroidal structure with an angular cloud distribution of @xmath4 , observer s view angle @xmath5 , and an outer radius of r@xmath60.55pc . </S>",
    "<S> the derived column density along the line of sight is n@xmath7=1.5@xmath8@xmath9 , which is sufficient to block the hard radiation from the active nucleus , and would explain the presence of pah molecules near to the ngc1808 s active nucleus .    </S>",
