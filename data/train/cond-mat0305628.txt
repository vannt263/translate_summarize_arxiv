    "in this paper it is argued that the recent trends unveiled in the context of manganites regarding the key role of inhomogeneities to explain the colossal magnetoresistance effect can be applied to a variety of other compounds as well .",
    "notably , evidence is rapidly accumulating that underdoped high temperature superconductors are also inhomogeneous at the nanoscale , and theoretical approximations that assume homogeneous states are questionable .",
    "it is still unclear if the inhomogeneities have stripe features , as discussed extensively in previous years , or whether they correspond to more randomly shaped clusters , as assumed in the manganite context .",
    "also the origin of these inhomogeneities is much debated .",
    "computational simulations will play a key role in determining the properties of models for manganites and cuprates , since percolative clustered physics is difficult to handle with other methods .",
    "even more recently , clustered states have also been discussed in a very unexpected context , the diluted magnetic semiconductors mn - doped gaas .",
    "these materials have considerable potential applications in spintronic devices and understanding their behavior may raise their current critical temperatures . in this publication , the three family of materials are briefly discussed and some key references provided such that the reader can appreciate the common trends between the many compounds .",
    "these quite unexpected similarities between apparently very different materials promises to lead to a global unified view , where clustered states become a new paradigm of condensed matter physics .",
    ", width=226 ]    manganites are currently attracting considerable attention mainly due to the presence of the colossal magnetoresistance effect in magnetotransport measurements@xcite .",
    "in addition , these materials have a complex phase diagram with a plethora of ordered phases , a characteristic of correlated electron systems .",
    "a variety of experimental and theoretical investigations have unveiled the inhomogeneous character of the states of relevance to explain the cmr phenomenon , with a competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states that induces coexistence of clusters at the nanometer - scale @xcite .    to understand this phenomenon , and its associated cmr effect , the first - order transitions that separate the metallic and insulating phases in the clean limit ( i.e. without disorder ) play a key role @xcite .",
    "the first - order character of the transition is caused by the different magnetic and charge orders of the competing states .",
    "the clean - limit phase diagram is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tg3 ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "when quenched disorder is introduced in the coupling or density that is modified to change from one phase to the other , the temperature where the nel and curie temperatures meet is reduced in value and eventually collapses to zero as in fig .",
    "[ fig : tg3 ] ( middle panel ) . further increasing the disorder strength",
    ", a spin glassy disordered region appears at low temperatures involving coexisting clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tg3 ] ( lower panel ) ) .",
    "simulations by burgy _",
    "@xcite have shown that the clustered state between the curie temperature and the clean - limit critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) , with preformed ferromagnetic regions of random orientations , has a huge magnetoresistance since _ small fields can easily align the moments of the ferromagnetic islands _ , leading to a percolative conductor in agreement with experiments@xcite .",
    "this establishes qualitative similarities with `` giant mr '' ( gmr ) multilayered materials , as sketched in fig.[fig : gmr ] .",
    "the quenched disorder simply triggers the stabilization of the cluster formation , but phase competition is the main driving force of the mixed state .",
    "elastic deformations may also play a key role in this context@xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the literature cited here , and references therein , for a more detailed view of this exciting area of investigations .",
    "the readers can also consult a list of `` open problems '' in the manganite context that has been recently provided@xcite .",
    "the results obtained for manganites are not crucially dependent on the nature of the two competing phases",
    ". the argumentation should be valid in the context of high temperature superconductors ( hts ) as well , where an antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator ( probably with stripes ) competes with a @xmath1-wave superconductor ( dsc ) . in the clean - limit , difficult to obtain with the standard chemical doping , the _ conjecture _ is that the two phases would have been separated by a line of first - order transitions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : burgy ] .",
    "the inevitable disorder of the chemical doping procedure opens a window , and in this context the glassy state that separates the insulator from the superconductor is made up of small clusters of the two competing phases@xcite very different from the homogeneous exotic states proposed for that regime .",
    "first - order transitions af - dsc have already appeared in electron doped materials@xcite , and they are also common in heavy - fermion and inorganic superconductor contexts .",
    "considering the general character of the discussion here , there should be an analog of the colossal effects in cuprates as well .",
    "in fact , _ colossal effects should be ubiquitous when ordered phases compete_. a possible manifestation of this effect could be the `` giant proximity effect '' recently discussed @xcite with uncorrelated preformed sc clusters  in the sense that their phases in the order parameter are random  percolating under the influence of nearby superconducting materials and leading to a strong josephson coupling across the originally non - superconducting sample .    these conjectured results for cuprates , where inhomogeneities play a key role , are in excellent agreement with the most exciting recent experimental developments in the high - tc arena , namely the scanning tunneling microscopy experiments that unveiled the clustered nature of these materials at the nanoscale.@xcite",
    "diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) are attracting much attention lately due to their potential for device applications in the growing field of spintronics .",
    "in particular , a large number of dms studies have focused on iii - v compounds where mn doping in inas and gaas has been achieved using molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) techniques .",
    "the main result of recent experimental efforts is the discovery@xcite of ferromagnetism at a curie temperature @xmath2@xmath3110  k in ga@xmath4mn@xmath5as , with mn concentrations @xmath6 up to 10% .",
    "it is widely believed that this ferromagnetism is `` carrier induced '' , with holes donated by mn ions mediating a ferromagnetic interaction between the randomly localized mn@xmath7 spins . in practice ,",
    "anti - site defects reduce the number of holes @xmath8 from its ideal value @xmath8=@xmath6 , leading to a ratio @xmath9=@xmath10 substantially smaller than one .    in this section",
    ", generic monte carlo ( mc ) studies of a diluted kondo lattice model for dms are summarized .",
    "@xcite further information can be obtained from the cited references .",
    "the hamiltonian is similar to those employed in the mn - oxide context , namely @xmath11 where @xmath12 creates a hole at site @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 , and the hole spin operator interacting antiferromagnetically with the localized mn - spin @xmath15 is @xmath16 .",
    "the carrier can visit @xmath17 site of the lattice .",
    "the interaction term is restricted to randomly selected sites , @xmath18 , with a @xmath19=5/2 mn - moment .",
    "these spins are here considered classical with @xmath20=1 , as widely assumed , allowing for a mc simulation technically similarly as in manganites@xcite .",
    "approximations include the neglect of on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath21 , valid at small @xmath6 and @xmath9 where double occupancy is unlikely even at @xmath22=0 .",
    "in addition , mn - oxides investigations @xcite show that an intermediate or large @xmath22 plays a role analogous to a hubbard @xmath23 at _ any _",
    "@xmath6 @xcite . at low @xmath6 ,",
    "the probability of nearest - neighbors ( nn ) mn - spins is also low ( 0.0625 at @xmath6=0.25 ) , justifying the neglect of an anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) mn - mn coupling .",
    "the hole motion is described by a one - band tight - binding model , while many bands may be necessary @xcite . despite this simplification",
    ", our model contains spins and holes in interaction and it is expected to capture the main qualitative aspects of carrier - induced ferromagnetism in dms materials .",
    "our effort builds upon previous important dms theoretical studies @xcite .",
    "however , it differs from previous approaches in important qualitative aspects as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the most important observations in the study of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) reported in @xcite , is the non - trivial dependence of @xmath2 with coupling , @xmath22 . for @xmath22@xmath24@xmath25 and a mn dilute system ,",
    "the holes are trapped in mn - sites , reducing drastically @xmath2 .",
    "small fm clusters of spins are formed at a temperature scale @xmath0 , but there is no correlation between them , leading to a global vanishing magnetization @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath26 the system is non - interacting .",
    "since both in the @xmath22@xmath30 and @xmath22=@xmath25 limits @xmath2 is suppressed , an _ optimal _",
    "@xmath27 must exist where @xmath2 is maximized .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[fig : paper1]a - b.@xcite    the ( @xmath6,@xmath9 ) dependence of @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : paper1]c , assuming @xmath28ev.@xcite in this figure , the best value of @xmath2 achieved experimentally for gamnas is also indicated approximately . note that increasing @xmath6 beyond the experimental value of 0.1 would significantly increase @xmath2 . at @xmath27 ,",
    "the best value is @xmath6@xmath30.25 , but room-@xmath29 ferromagnetism would be possible even with @xmath6@xmath30.15 .",
    "an increase of @xmath2 could also be achieved if the compensation could be decreased ; in the optimal case the best value would be close to @xmath30 .",
    "these predictions seem in agreement with experimental developments since very recently ga@xmath4mn@xmath5as samples with @xmath2 as high as @xmath31 k were prepared,@xcite a result believed to be caused by an enhanced free - hole density .",
    "dynamical and transport properties have also been calculated for the model presented here @xcite .",
    "of special importance is the conductance , @xmath32 , which is calculated using the kubo formula adapted to geometries usually employed in the context of mesoscopic systems.@xcite the cluster is considered to be connected by ideal contacts to two semi - infinite ideal leads , as represented in fig .",

    "the system is weakly metallic at all temperatures . in the other limit of strong couplings , @xmath36  proportional to the resistivity @xmath37  decreases with increasing temperature , indicating a clear insulating phase , as a result of the system being in a clustered state at the temperatures explored,@xcite with carriers localized near the mn spins . at the important intermediate couplings emphasized in our effort",
    ", the system behaves like a dirty metal for @xmath38 , while for @xmath39 , @xmath36 slightly decreases with increasing temperature , indicating that a soft metal to insulator transition takes place near @xmath2 . for @xmath40 , where the system is paramagnetic , @xmath36 is almost constant .",
    "note that for strong enough @xmath22 , @xmath41 and therefore no metallic phase is present .",
    "it is interesting to compare these numerical results with experiments . for ga@xmath4mn@xmath5as ,",
    "data similar to those found in our investigations have been reported.@xcite the qualitative behavior of the resistivity in these samples agrees well with the theoretical results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho4d3]b if intermediate couplings are considered .",
    "the clustered state that forms just above @xmath2 is a candidate to describe dms materials since it explains both the resistivity maximum around @xmath2 , as well as the decrease in resistivity with increasing applied magnetic field .",
    "in addition , it provides an optimal @xmath2 .",

    "@xcite explained their results using a distributed magnetic polaron model , that resembles the clustered - state ideas discussed here and in refs .",
    "the present simulations unveils a _ previously unknown similarity between dms materials and transition metal oxides _ , since both have regimes where clustered states dominate .",
