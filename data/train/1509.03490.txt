    "it follows from thom s transversality theorems , as it is explained by j. cerf in the beginning of @xcite , that the space @xmath130 of real smooth functions on @xmath1 has a natural stratification whose strata of codimension @xmath131 are the following :    * the stratum @xmath132 , an open dense set in @xmath130 , is formed by morse functions whose critical values are all simple .",

    "this event is the crossing of the stratum @xmath134 , say at time @xmath152 .",
    "since the functions @xmath163 are morse for @xmath164 close to @xmath152 , the critical points can be followed continuously on @xmath165 .",
    "generically , the pseudo - gradient is morse - smale at the time @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , the morse complex remains the same on a small interval .",

    "the question is how the types and coupling of critical points are changing when @xmath164 crosses the time @xmath152 .    with barannikov",
    "we limit ourselves to the case when @xmath1 is the @xmath171-sphere @xmath172 and the crossing does not involve the extremal values , this latter question being left as an exercise to the reader . since on a sphere the only critical points of homological type are the extrema , the crossing deals with critical values of upper / lower type .",
    "we shall say that there is _ no bifurcation _ if the crossing keeps all critical points with their initial types and coupling ( remember that , near a crossing time all the functions of the considered path are morse and the critical points can be followed smoothly in time due to the implicit function theorem ) .",
    "one checks by hand that there is no bifurcation if @xmath173 and @xmath174 have distinct indices .",
    "now , we are reduced to the case where the two crossing critical values have the same index , say @xmath4 .",

    "a bifurcation can occur only in case ( a left ) , that is : @xmath188 is of upper type and below @xmath189 which is of lower type .    assuming the above necessary condition , a bifurcation occurs if and only if @xmath190= [ \\si^2]$ ] in @xmath191 up to a scalar . in that case , for @xmath170 , @xmath173 becomes of lower type and @xmath174 becomes of upper type ; the new coupling is shown on ( a right ) .",

    "for instance , if the framing points up at the maximum , the maximum principle tells us that any extension must have at least one critical point in the interior .",
    "barannikov s discussion will be of course more subtle .",
    "the framing may be attached to a morse function on @xmath1 , an @xmath2-equivalence class of morse complexes or the associated morse - barannikov complex @xmath251 as well .",
    "we will speak of the _ framed barannikov diagram .",
    "_ we are going to look at the framed barannikov complex and get some information in relation to the extension problem .    from now on ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath243 and @xmath252 .",
    "a framed function @xmath253 is said to be _ standard _",
    "if @xmath0 has two critical points only , the framing pointing down at the maximum and pointing up at the minimum . in this case , there is a standard extension to the @xmath237-ball without critical points .",
    "+ now , start with a generic germ @xmath241 along @xmath172 and assume there is an extension without critical points @xmath254 .",
    "then , there is a one - parameter family of spheres @xmath255 $ ] , such that @xmath256 , @xmath257 lies inside @xmath258 when @xmath259 and the germ of @xmath260 along @xmath261 is _",
    "standard_. set @xmath262 ; it is a function thought of as defined on @xmath243 , equipped with a framing due to the knowledge of @xmath257 for @xmath263 .",
    "the framing says the direction of moving of the spheres near a critical point @xmath8 of @xmath163 ( up to isotopy , @xmath260 may be locally thought of as the height function in @xmath264 ) .",
    "generically , for such a family of spheres , the map @xmath265 is a generic path of functions in the sense of section 2 .",
    "therefore , there is a sequence of bifurcations starting from a given germ and ending at the standard germ .",
    "there is no bifurcation of framing . at a birth time",
    "the pair @xmath266 which has born with @xmath267 has the _ standard _ framing : the arrows are both up or both down ; such a pair will be said to be a _",
    "standard pair_. at a crossing time @xmath152 involving the pair of critical values @xmath268 , with the same indices , each critical point keeps its framing during the crossing .",
    "but , the rule of moving added to the rule of numbering implies that , for @xmath168 , the arrow of @xmath188 is up and the arrow of @xmath189 is down ( compare fig .",
    "4 ) . at each generic time",
    ", we have a well - defined morse - barannikov framed complex and the bifurcations are those allowed by propositions [ bifa ] to [ bifc ] .",
    "of course , in each case the bifurcation occurs only when the required homological condition is satisfied .",
    "if it is not , the crossing yields no bifurcation .",
    "barannikov idea s . not any sequence of allowed bifurcations of the framed barannikov s complex is realizable by a sequence of bifurcations of framed morse complex ; at the level of framed barannikov diagram there is no longer homological condition",
    ". therefore , there is a _ formal problem _ which is the following : given a framed barannikov complex , does there exist a sequence of allowed bifurcations connecting it to the standard barannikov complex ( _ i.e. _ one maximum down and one minimum up ) ? if there is no solution to the formal problem , _ a fortiori _ there is no solution to the extension problem without critical point .",
    "now , the question is whether it is possible to answer the formal problem in finite time .",
    "this question is solved by the last theorem in barannikov s article .",
    "one checks on the list of bifurcations that such a pair could not disappear alone . at best , it is possible to shift the indices of the involved critical points ( use the bifurcation of fig .",
    "4 one pair being inverted and the other being standard in the sense of the birth bifurcation ) .",
    "but , two inverted pairs involving of a bifurcation as shown on fig.4 become both standard and then , each of them can be cancelled .    as a consequence , an obvious obstruction to extending without critical points",
    "is the parity of the number of inverted pairs in the initial framed morse function .",
    "the obstruction which follows from theorem [ obstruction ] is more subtle as shown in the next example .",
    "the proof of theorem [ obstruction ] is based on the fact that there is a very short list of bifurcations involving at least one inverted pair ; moreover , the role of the two types , i and ii , are completely different . here is the list of these bifurcations :    1 .",
    "a pair of type i and a pair of type ii of the same indices yield two standard pairs ; 2 .",
    "two pairs of type i whose indices differ by 1 yield two standard pairs whose indices differ by 1 ; 3 .",
    "two standard pairs having the same index @xmath4 yield a pair of type i and a pair of type ii both having the index @xmath4 ; 4 .   two standard pairs",
    "whose indices are @xmath4 and @xmath46 yield two pairs of type ii whose indices are still @xmath4 and @xmath46 ; 5 .   a pair of type i and index @xmath4 and a standard pair of index @xmath271 yield a pair of type ii and index @xmath271 and a standard pair of index @xmath4 .    in particular , it is impossible to change the index of a pair of type ii . for proving theorem [ obstruction ] , without losing generality we may assume that the initial complex @xmath269 has no standard pairs .",
    "all the coupled pairs are inverted and we are facing the problem of canceling them , maybe with the help of introducing standard pairs ( births ) whose bifurcations could create new inverted pairs in good positions for a total cancellation .",
    "one checks that this event can not happen .",
    "according to the previous list , for canceling one pair @xmath272 of type ii it is required to have one pair @xmath273 of type i and of the same index is the right position allowing the bifurcation ( 1 ) .",
    "if @xmath273 comes from births followed by the bifurcation ( 3 ) , then @xmath273 is born with another pair of type ii still with the same index .",
    "so the price to pay the cancellation of @xmath272 with @xmath273 is the appearance of @xmath274 which is almost in the same position as @xmath272 in the barannikov diagram , up to a shift of the heights in the direction of the arrows of the framing .",
    "so , nothing is gained .",
    "the complete proof follows the same line .",
    "we refer to barannikov s article for the details ."
