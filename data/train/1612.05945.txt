    "due to the large amount of stellar flux received , hot planets ( @xmath1 @xmath2 5 days ) provide insight into extreme astrophysical processes that do not occur around longer period planets .",
    "these planets are often observed to be inflated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and detailed rotational and atmospheric dynamics have now been observed for the hot jupiters hd 189733 b @xcite and hd 209458 b @xcite .",
    "perhaps the most interesting dynamical process observed around hot planets is evaporative mass loss .",
    "this process was first observed by @xcite for the hot jupiter hd 209458 b : observations of the uv hydrogen line ly@xmath0 showed an extended atmosphere of neutral hydrogen that was larger than the planet s roche limit .",
    "followup observations demonstrated that the mass loss was highly variable and changed significantly from epoch to epoch @xcite .",
    "subsequent investigations of other hot planet systems , namely hd 189733 b , 55 cnc b , and gj 436 b , have revealed a handful of mass loss detections @xcite .",
    "the most recent mass loss detection around gj 436 b by @xcite highlighted the possibility of observing these extended and escaping atmospheres both before and after the nominal planetary transit ( i.e. , the broadband white light transit ) .",
    "besides gj 436 b , evidence for pre - transit signatures have been observed for wasp-12 b @xcite and hd 189733 b @xcite .",
    "although it seems that both pre- and in - transit signatures of extended atmospheres may be common for hot planets , observing these phenomena requires significant telescope resources since there is evidence that they do not manifest in broadband photometric observations @xcite , i.e. , the absorption is only seen in strong atomic lines . due to the abundance of hydrogen and the intrinsic line strength ,",
    "the atomic transition most suited for measuring the dynamics of the escaping material is the resonance line ly@xmath0 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". currently , the only telescope capable of performing high - spectral resolution ly@xmath0 observations is the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) .",
    "thus it is difficult to perform exploratory ly@xmath0 measurements of these phenomena for a large number of systems due to the high demand for time on _ hst _ and the inherent variability associated with the mass loss process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our recent detections of pre - transit , as well as in - transit , h@xmath0 absorption signatures around hd 189733 b suggest that it may be possible to detect highly extended neutral atmospheres using high - resolution optical spectrographs @xcite . a detection of excited hydrogen via the flux decrement at the balmer jump",
    "was first reported by @xcite for hd 209458 b. while our excited hydrogen measurements for hd 189733 b do not show evidence of large blue - shifted velocities indicative of escaping material , the transit depths indicate that the transmission spectrum is probing pressures of 10@xmath310@xmath4 bars , i.e. , the planetary thermosphere @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite recently questioned the planetary origin of the hd 189733 h@xmath0 signal due to velocity centroids in the transmission spectra that appear to correspond to the stellar rest frame .",
    "thus there are still questions concerning the nature of the in - transit hd 189733 h@xmath0 measurements . in an upcoming paper , however , we will argue for the planetary interpretation although further observations are certainly warranted to confirm either hypothesis .",
    "detections of highly extended atmospheres via h@xmath0 absorption would provide strong targets for followup ly@xmath0 observations that can be used to constrain the mass loss mechanism and escape rate .    in this paper",
    "we present high spectral resolution observations of h@xmath0 for the hot planets kelt-3 b @xcite and gj 436 b @xcite with the aim of searching for h@xmath0 absorption in the circumplanetary environment .",
    "kelt-3 b was chosen for both the brightness ( v@xmath59.8 ) , visibility during the 2016 a semester , and the suggested low chromospheric activity level of its host star @xcite , a desirable property since stellar activity can mimic absorption signatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gj 436 b was targeted due to the large ly@xmath0 transit depth measured by @xcite : even a small fraction ( @xmath60.01% ) of the neutral hydrogen in the @xmath7 state would be detectable across a single transit .",
    "a detection of excited hydrogen absorption around these planets would significantly expand the confirmed h@xmath0 detections ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and further our understanding of how this line forms in hot exoplanet environments .",
    "the observations were performed using the bench spectrograph with hydra @xcite at the wiyn 3.5 meter telescope .",
    "the instrument was configured to provide the highest resolution possible ( @xmath8 ) for a single spectral order of width 380   with h@xmath0 positioned at the center of the order .",
    "this setup was achieved using the bench spectrograph camera combined with the blue fiber cables and the 316@63.4 echelle grating .",
    "target exposures were taken for two separate transits of each object .",
    "details of the observations are given in .",
    "we note that the smaller number of in - transit exposures of kelt-3 on 2016 - 02 - 04 compared with 2016 - 03 - 02 is the result of suspended observations due to high wind speeds .",

    "the exact number of sky and comparison object fibers for each date are given in .",
    "the sky fibers are necessary to subtract out a simultaneous sky spectrum , which includes both continuum emission and night sky emission lines .",
    "comparison stars are important for identifying artifacts in the transmission spectrum , e.g. , imperfect sky subtraction .",
    "the data were reduced using custom idl routines .",
    "standard reduction steps were performed including bias subtraction , flat fielding of the individual fiber spectra , and wavelength calibration using thar lamp spectra .",
    "individual fiber spectra were extracted using a 7-pixel wide boxcar .",
    "cosmic rays in all spectra were identified and removed post - extraction through median filtering of the individual exposures .",
    "the background sky emission can be a non - negligible contribution to the object spectrum depending on the relative brightness between the sky and the object .",
    "this contribution can be exacerbated by moonlight scattered off of clouds in the field of view .",
    "thus a careful accounting of the sky spectrum from exposure to exposure is important since we are looking for signals in the target spectrum at the @xmath61% level",
    ". we also account for small variations in the sky spectrum across the field of view by only selecting the sky fibers with angular distance @xmath1010@xmath11 from the target or comparison fibers .",
    "this normally includes @xmath61015 sky fibers for each object fiber .    for each exposure",
    "the proximate sky fibers are selected for both the target fiber and each individual comparison fiber .",
    "the relative transmission efficiency of the sky and target / comparison fibers are calculated using the extracted flat field spectra .",
    "cosmic rays are filtered out of the sky spectra using a 3@xmath12 median filter .",
    "the median sky spectrum for the target and each comparison fiber is calculated and subtracted from the target or comparison spectrum .",
    "examples of the simultaneous target , comparison , and sky spectra are shown in and .",
    "small shifts of a spectrum on the detector can occur throughout the night which amount to small changes in the wavelengths of spectral features . to account for these changes , each spectrum is shifted against a portion of a reference spectrum until the standard deviation of ratio of the spectra is minimized .",
    "the region of interest near h@xmath0 is not included in the standard deviation minimization .",
    "these shifts are typically on the order 0.001 0.01   and correlate strongly between objects , i.e. , the cause is instrumental and not intrinsic to the targets .",
    "we define the transmission spectrum as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the average spectrum from some time period ( e.g. , @xmath15the pre - transit exposures and @xmath16the in - transit exposures ) and @xmath17 is the average spectrum from a comparison time period .",
    "this is the same definition used in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we compare three different groups of exposures to each other : pre - transit , in - transit , and post - transit ( see ) .",
    "after @xmath18 is calculated , it is renormalized with a low degree polynomial in order to remove any residual slope in the spectrum .",
    "the transmission spectra for kelt-3 b are shown in and the spectra for gj 436 b are shown in .",
    "we measure the absorption across a 1000 km s@xmath19 band , or 21.9  , centered on h@xmath0 .",
    "the absorption is calculated as the equivalent width of @xmath18 from :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the flux in the spectrum of the group of interest at velocity @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the flux in the comparison group spectrum at velocity @xmath22 , and @xmath24 is the wavelength difference at velocity @xmath22 .",
    "this is essentially the negative total of @xmath18 .",

    "the kelt-3 spectra are high enough signal - to - noise to exclude 3@xmath12 absorption @xmath261.3@xmath2710@xmath28  , a value similar to that measured for hd 189733 b in @xcite .",
    "we have also computed @xmath25 as a function of time for the higher signal - to - noise dates 2016 - 02 - 04 ( kelt-3 ) and 2016 - 02 - 23 ( gj 436 ) dates . for the individual measurements , we choose to narrow the integration width to @xmath29 km",
    "s@xmath19 so as to not introduce additional uncertainty into the already noisy individual measurements .",
    "the @xmath25 timeseries is shown in .",
    "for each date , the first five pre - transit spectra , which correspond to the first five points shown in each panel , are used to construct a comparison spectrum .",
    "all individual transmission spectra are then constructed with that comparison spectrum .",
    "we note that individual points that appear to show a 1 - 2@xmath12 signal are most likely the result of small residual differences in sky subtractions , which tend to average out in the master spectra ( see and ) .",
    "in other words , we do not believe these signals are intrinsic to the stellar system .",
    "uncertainties for each point are the normalized flux uncertainties added in quadrature across the range of integration .",
    "the absence of absorption in individual kelt-3 observations is consistent with the null detection in the combined average spectra .",
    "although no significant h@xmath0 changes are detected , the observations serve as a demonstration of the achievable precision for @xmath30@xmath610 stars using a high - resolution spectrograph on a 4-meter telescope .",
    "absorption is also absent from the gj 436 timeseries .",
    "we have simulated what the expected @xmath25 signal would be from the extended hydrogen cloud suggested by @xcite and revisited by @xcite ( b16 in ) to include interactions of the planetary outflow with the stellar wind .",
    "the @xmath31 values ( red solid line ) are calculated directly from the simulated ly@xmath0 profiles of visit 2 from @xcite .",
    "note that we follow both @xcite and @xcite by only integrating the absorbed ly@xmath0 flux between @xmath32 km s@xmath19 and @xmath33 km s@xmath19 .    to construct the h@xmath0 absorption from the ly@xmath0 measurements , we assume a simple gaussian line profile shape for ly@xmath0 and fit the optical depth , line center , and line width to the simulated line profile from @xcite .",
    "we then use this simplified line profile to solve for the @xmath34 column density :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the ly@xmath0 oscillator strength , @xmath37 is the electron charge , @xmath38 is the electron mass , @xmath39 is the ly@xmath0 rest wavelength , @xmath40 is the speed of light in vacuum , and @xmath41 is the @xmath34 optical depth at line center . we assume various excited - to - ground state ratios for the hydrogen atoms which gives the @xmath7 column density , @xmath42 , based on @xmath43 and , using the same line widths , calculate the corresponding h@xmath0 line profile at each time .",
    "the model @xmath25 values are then calculated from the approximated line profiles . however , since h@xmath0 is unaffected by interstellar absorption , we integrate from @xmath44 km s@xmath19 to @xmath45 km s@xmath19 to simulate the measurements made from our observations .",
    "we do not integrate from @xmath46 to @xmath47 km s@xmath19 since this contributes nothing to @xmath25 for the model line profiles .",
    "we assume that the column density at each time is constant across the stellar disk and that the entire disk is occulted by the hydrogen cloud ( see figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the gaussian approximations to the ly@xmath0 model profiles and the treatment of the column density from yields a median @xmath34 column density of @xmath48 cm@xmath28 .",
    "we caution that more precise column densities , as a function of velocity , should be retrieved from the full model output of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 model values are shown as dashed - dotted lines in for excited - to - ground state ratios @xmath50=10@xmath51 ( steel blue ) and 10@xmath52 ( dark green ) .",
    "note that the right - hand axis gives the ly@xmath0 model values while the left - hand axis corresponds to @xmath25 values , both for the model and data .",
    "our simulated @xmath25 values show that , based on the @xcite model , only for optimistic ratios of @xmath5310@xmath51 would the cloud absorption be detectable in our observations .",
    "including hydrogen excitation in a model similar to that from @xcite would be useful in order to produce more realistic estimates of the excited hydrogen absorption .",
    "our first - order estimates suggest that @xmath50@xmath5410@xmath52 throughout the neutral hydrogen cloud .",
    "this is a fairly weak constraint and could be improved with more sensitive observations from 8 - 10 meter class telescopes .",
    "in this section we explore spherically symmetric atmospheres as a first approximation to placing upper limits on the size of the excited hydrogen atmosphere around each planet .",
    "two parameters control the absorption strength : the radial extent of the atmosphere , which determines the depth of the line , and density , which can produce opacity broadening if the column densities are large enough .",
    "we take the atmospheres to be of uniform density and we present 1@xmath12 limits in two cases : 1 . varying the density and radial extent of the atmosphere to produce a value of @xmath25 detectable at the 1@xmath12 level ; 2 . varying the density of a filled hill sphere , i.e. , a fixed radial extent . in both cases , we restrict the line depth to less than the 1@xmath12 flux limit . in case 1 , the line depth restriction is the main determinant of the radial extent .",
    "the filled hill sphere is an extreme case for kelt-3 b , which has a fairly high surface gravity ( see ) , but gj 436 b is known to be experiencing significant mass loss and overflowing its hill sphere @xcite . the choice of uniform density is motivated by the findings of @xcite who calculated h@xmath0 absorption in the atmosphere of hd 189733 b.    the model consists of a uniform density atmosphere surrounding the planet at mid - transit .",

    "we fill a 3d grid with material at the specified density and extinct the intensity from the star that is obscured by those grid points .",
    "the line profile is approximated as a doppler  broadened delta function @xcite with an intrinsic width of @xmath55@xmath56 km s@xmath19 .",
    "this value is chosen based on the line width necessary to reproduce the in - transit h@xmath0 transmission spectra from @xcite . for simplicity and due to fact that no signal is detected in any @xmath18 measurements , we neglect any broadening from stellar or planetary rotation .",
    "we also neglect any limb darkening effects from the star . the flux from the unobscured portions of the stellar disk",
    "are then added to the absorbed grid points and the final summed line profile is normalized .",
    "the line profile is then convolved with a gaussian of fwhm 15 km s@xmath19 to approximate the hydra instrumental profile .    to determine the case 1 and case 2 limits , we take the flux uncertainties from the observed transmission spectra and apply them uniformly to the model spectra .",
    "we then propagate the flux errors in quadrature when calculating @xmath25 .",
    "the limits are determined when the model signal approaches the 1@xmath12 level .",
    "limits are derived only for the nights of 20160204 and 20160223 due to the higher quality of data . for the filled hill sphere , or case 2 ,",
    "we vary the density until the line depth approaches the 1@xmath12 flux uncertainty .",

    "given the suggested extent of the escaping neutral hydrogen envelope , it is plausible that the base layer , which we are not sensitive enough to probe , could produce absorption detectable with an 8 - 10 meter class telescope .",
    "we note that this base thermospheric layer is independent of the outflowing material so the @xmath50 limits derived here are not applicable .",
    "the brightness of kelt-3 would allow a similar detection if excited hydrogen exists out to 1.1 @xmath58 in similar densities to what we ve modeled here .",
    "we note that the 1@xmath12 density limits derived for the limited radial atmospheres are fairly large and that non - negligible absorption produced by lower densities is certainly plausible .",
    "the case of kelt-3 b can be compared to the simulations by @xcite for the hot planet wasp-77 b @xcite , which has a slightly larger surface gravity and similar equilibrium temperature .",
    "these fairly compact planets have neutral - to - ionized layers that form closer to the planet ( see figure 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , reducing the strength of the potential h@xmath0 transmission signal .",

    "one explanation for the lack of h@xmath0 absorption around gj 436 b , despite the fact that large quantities of neutral hydrogen are clearly present @xcite , is the amount of euv flux received by the planet .",
    "@xcite found that the h@xmath0 absorption measured by @xcite required an ionization rate larger than the nominal value by a factor of @xmath63.5 .",
    "this suggests that a significant @xmath7 population requires a large amount of euv and xuv flux .",
    "the estimated euv and xuv flux from gj 436 is lower than that of hd 189733 by @xmath61.5 magnitudes , in both cases @xcite .",
    "thus although there is abundant neutral hydrogen around the planet , it is likely almost entirely in the ground state , a conclusion that is supported by the time series analysis in .",
    "the low peak temperature of @xmath65000 k in the thermosphere , as simulated by @xcite , may also be the reason for the lack of @xmath7 hydrogen : an excitation temperature of @xmath614300 k is needed to produce @xmath61 .",
    "however , we caution that hot planets experience highly non - equilibrium conditions and thus can not be assumed to have a single steady - state temperature in their extended atmospheres .",

    "we also find no evidence for absorption by unbound circumplanetary material .",
