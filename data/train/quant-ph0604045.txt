    "it is one of the most remarkable features of quantum physics that measurements on separated systems can not always be described by local realistic theories  @xcite .",
    "typically , this phenomenon is revealed by the violation of a bell inequality , which are constraints that have to be satisfied by any local realistic description .",
    "bell inequality violations have been observed experimentally in various physical systems , such as entangled photon pairs , as reviewed in  @xcite and entangled @xmath0 ions  @xcite . for a background on bell inequalities readers",
    "are referred to  @xcite , and references therein .",
    "usually , experiments to test bell inequalities involve making many measurements on individual copies of the quantum system with the system being prepared in the same way for each measurement . in this paper",
    ", we consider a somewhat different scenario and ask if quantum nonlocality can be enhanced by making joint local measurements on multiple copies of the entangled state .",
    "we will use the maximal bell inequality violation of a quantum state @xmath1 as our measure of nonlocality .",
    "our interest is to determine if @xmath2 , when compared with @xmath1 , can give rise to a higher bell inequality violation for some @xmath3 .",
    "a very similar problem was introduced by peres  @xcite who considered bell inequality violations under collective measurements but allowed the experimenters to make an auxiliary measurement on their systems and postselect on both getting a specific outcome of their measurement .",
    "numerically , peres showed that with collective measurements and postselection  @xcite , a large class of two - qubit states give rise to better bell inequality violation .",
    "moreover , explicit examples were given to illustrate that collective measurements with postselection can be used to detect the nonlocality of a larger set of entangled states .",
    "that postselection can be used to reveal such `` hidden nonlocality '' , was already shown in 1994 by popescu  @xcite using sequential measurements .",
    "after that , gisin  @xcite also demonstrated that ( without collective measurements ) postselection itself in the form of local filtering operations can be used to detect a larger set of two - qubit entangled states .",
    "it is worth noting that an experimental demonstration of `` hidden nonlocality '' has been reported in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will show that postselection is not necessary to improve bell inequality violation . in order to find such examples for mixed states",
    "we have resorted to various numerical approaches that are described in  @xcite and provide upper and lower bounds on the optimal violation of a given bell inequality by a given quantum state .",
    "the two algorithms described in  @xcite make use of convex optimization techniques , specifically semidefinite programs  @xcite .",
    "the first , henceforth referred as the lb algorithm , is an algorithm that can be used to determine , for a given quantum state @xmath1 , a lower bound of its maximal violation of a given bell inequality .",
    "this can be seen as an extension of the see - saw iteration developed by werner and wolf  @xcite to bell inequalities with more than two outcomes . as with many other numerical optimization techniques",
    ", the lb algorithm converges to a local maximum of the global optimization problem , and hence , feeding the algorithm with various random initial guesses is essential .",
    "unless otherwise stated , bell inequality violations presented hereafter refer to the best violation that we could find either analytically , or numerically using this lb algorithm .",
    "complementarily , the other algorithm , which we shall refer as the ub algorithm , is one that can be used to determine an upper bound on the maximal violation of @xmath1 for a given bell inequality .",
    "the technique involves relaxing the complicated optimization over measurements in the bell experiment to a sequence of semidefinite programs using techniques that have been developed in the general context of non - linear optimization theory  @xcite and applied in quantum information theory in other contexts  @xcite .",
    "these methods provide global upper bounds on the bell inequality violation that can be accurately and efficiently computed .",
    "the upper bounds obtained via this algorithm are often not tight , but are sometimes non - trivial  @xcite .",
    "for ease of reference , these upper bounds are marked where they appear with @xmath4 . in the event that a violation presented is known to be maximal ( such as those computable using the horodecki s criterion  @xcite ) , an * will be attached .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : measurements ] , we present a measurement scheme which we will use to determine the bell - clauser - horne inequality violation for any bipartite pure state .",
    "these measurements led to the largest violation that we were able to find and may even be maximal .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : pure - states ] , we show that for bipartite pure entangled states , collective measurement can lead to a greater violation of the bell - ch inequality . the corresponding scenario for mixed entangled states is analyzed in sec .  [ sec : mixed - states ] .",
    "we then conclude with a summary of results and some future avenues of research .",
    "in this section , we present a measurement scheme which gives rise to the largest bell - clauser - horne ( henceforth abbreviated as bell - ch ) inequality  @xcite violation that we have found for arbitrary pure two-_qudit _ states , i.e.  quantum states describing a composite of two @xmath5-dimensional quantum subsystems .",
    "we find using this inequality for probabilities rather than correlations to be convenient for our purposes and the equivalence between the bell - ch inequality and the bell - clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( henceforth abbreviated as bell - chsh ) inequality  @xcite in the ideal limit , implies that if the conjectured measurement scheme is optimal for the bell - ch inequality , it will also give rise to the maximal bell - chsh inequality violation for any pure two - qudit state .",
    "the bell - ch inequality is meant for an experimental setup involving two observers , alice ( a ) and bob ( b ) .",
    "each of these observers can perform two alternative measurements , and each measurement gives rise to two possible outcomes which we shall label by @xmath6 .",
    "the bell - ch inequality is as follows  @xcite : @xmath7 where @xmath8 refers to the joint probability that experimental outcome @xmath9 and @xmath10 are observed at a s and b s site respectively , given that alice performs the @xmath11 and bob performs the @xmath12 measurement ; the marginal probabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 are similarly defined . in quantum mechanics , these probabilities",
    "are calculated according to @xmath15 where we have denoted by @xmath16 the povm element associated with the  + \" outcome of alice s @xmath17 measurement and @xmath18 the povm element associated with the  - \" outcome of bob s @xmath19 measurement .",
    "the maximal bell inequality violation for a quantum state is invariant under a local unitary transformation . as such ,",
    "the maximal bell inequality violation for any bipartite pure quantum state is identical to its maximal violation when written in the schmidt basis  @xcite . in this basis , an arbitrary bipartite pure state in @xmath5-dimension",
    ", @xmath20 takes the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are local orthonormal bases of subsystem possessed by observer a and b respectively , and @xmath24 are the schmidt coefficients of @xmath20 . without loss of generality , we may also assume that @xmath25",
    ". then @xmath26 is entangled if and only if @xmath27 .",
    "now , let s consider the following measurement settings for alice , which were first adopted in  @xcite , @xmath28,\\quad a_2^{\\pm}={\\frac{1}{2}}\\left[{\\mathbf{1}}_d\\pm x\\right],\\nonumber\\\\ z\\equiv \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor}\\sigma_z+\\pi,\\quad x\\equiv \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor d/2\\rfloor}\\sigma_x+\\pi,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eqn : alice - povm}\\left[\\pi\\right]_{ij}=0\\quad\\forall\\quad i , j\\neq d,\\qquad \\left[\\pi\\right]_{dd}=d\\mod 2,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the pauli @xmath31 and @xmath32 matrices .    notice , however , that the @xmath33 given in  @xcite is not optimal .",
    "in fact , given the measurements for alice in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : alice - povm ] ) , the optimization of bob s measurement settings can be carried out explicitly  @xcite .",
    "using the resulting analytic expression for bob s optimal povm  @xcite , the optimal expectation value of the bell - ch operator  @xcite for @xmath20 can be computed and we find @xmath34 where @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "effectively , this measurement scheme corresponds to first ordering each party s local basis vectors @xmath36 according to their schmidt coefficients , and grouping them pairwise in descending order from the schmidt vector with the largest schmidt coefficient .",
    "physically , this can be achieved by alice and bob each performing an appropriate local unitary transformation .",
    "each of their hilbert space can then be represented as a direct sum of 2-dimensional subspaces , which can be regarded as a one - qubit space , plus a 1-dimensional subspace if @xmath5 is odd .",
    "the final step of the measurement consists of performing the optimal measurement  @xcite in each of these two - qubit spaces as if the other spaces did not exist .    from here",
    ", it is easy to see that if we have a maximally entangled state , i.e. @xmath37 , then gives @xmath38 under this measurement scheme , the bell - ch inequality violation for a maximally entangled state with even @xmath5 is thus the maximum allowed by cirelson s bound  @xcite whereas that of maximally entangled state with odd @xmath5 is not .",
    "how good is the measurement scheme ?",
    "it is constructed so that for two - qubits , i.e. when @xmath39 , gives the same violation found in  @xcite , and is the maximal violation determined by horodecki et  al .",
    "the measurement given by is hence optimal for two - qubit states . for higher dimensional quantum systems ,",
    "we have looked at randomly generated pure two - qudit states ( @xmath40 ) with their ( unnormalized ) schmidt coefficients uniformly chosen at random from the interval @xmath41 .",
    "for all of the 20,000 states generated for each @xmath5 , we found that with as the initial measurement setting , the ( iterative ) lb algorithm never gives a @xmath42 that is different from by more than @xmath43 , thus indicating that is , at least , a local maximum of the optimization problem .",
    "furthermore , for another 8,000 randomly generated pure two - qudit states , 1,000 each for @xmath40 , an extensive numerical search using more than @xmath44 random initial measurement guesses have not led to a single instance where @xmath42 is higher than that given in  @xcite .",
    "these numerical results suggest that the measurement scheme given by may be the optimal measurement that maximizes the bell - ch inequality violation for arbitrary pure two - qudit states .",
    "let s now look into the problem of whether nonlocal correlations can be enhanced by performing collective measurements on @xmath3 copies of an entangled quantum state  . as our first example of nonlocality enhancement , consider again those maximally entangled states residing in hilbert space with odd @xmath5 .",
    "it is well known their maximal bell - ch/ bell - chsh inequality violation can not saturate cirelson s bound  @xcite .",
    "in fact , their best known bell - ch inequality violation  @xcite is that given in  . by combining @xmath45 copies of these quantum states",
    ", it is readily seen that we effectively end up with another maximally entangled state of @xmath46-dimension .",
    "it then follows from that their bell - ch violation under collective measurements increases monotonically with the number of copies @xmath45 ( see also table  [ tbl : maximalviolation ] , column 3 and 7 ) .",
    "in fact , it can be easily shown that this violation approaches asymptotically the cirelson s bound  @xcite in the limit of large @xmath45 . therefore , if the maximal violation of these quantum states is given by , collective measurements can already give better bell - ch violation with @xmath47 .",
    "even if the maximal violation is not given by , it can be seen , by comparing the upper bound of the single - copy violation from the ub algorithm and the lower bound of the @xmath45-copy violation , from table  [ tbl : maximalviolation ] that for @xmath48 and @xmath49 , a bell - ch violation better than the maximal single - copy violation can always be obtained when @xmath45 is sufficiently large .",
    "such an enhancement is even more pronounced in the case of non - maximally entangled states .",
    "in particular , for @xmath45 copies of a ( non - maximally entangled ) two - qubit state written in the schmidt basis , @xmath50 where @xmath51  @xcite . the bell - ch violation given by",
    "is @xmath52 where @xmath53,\\ ] ] is the total probability of finding @xmath54 in one of the _ perfectly correlated 2-dimensional subspaces _",
    "( i.e.  a subspace with @xmath55 ) upon reordering of the schmidt coefficients in descending order .",
    "it is interesting to note that for these two - qubit states , their bell - ch inequality violation for @xmath56 copies , and @xmath57 copies are identical  @xcite for all @xmath58 , as illustrated in the second column of table  [ tbl : maximalviolation ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : s : nme : qubit ] .",
    "this feature , however , does not seem to generalize to higher dimensions .",

    "the curves from right to left represent increasing numbers of copies .",
    "the dotted horizontal line at @xmath62 is the maximal possible violation of bell - ch inequality ; correlations allowed by local realistic theories have values less than or equal to zero .",
    "the solid line is the maximal bell - ch inequality violation of @xmath63 determined using the horodecki s criterion  @xcite.,width=370,height=287 ]    like the odd - dimensional maximally entangled state , the violation of the bell - ch inequality for _ any _ pure two - qubit entangled states , as given by , increases asymptotically towards the cirelson bound  @xcite with the number of copies @xmath45 , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : s : nme : qubit ] .",
    "a direct implication of this is that , with a sufficiently large number of copies , the nonlocality present in _ any _ weakly entangled pure two - qubit states is of no noticeable difference from that in a maximally entangled two - qubit state .",
    ".[tbl : maximalviolation ] best known bell - ch inequality violation for some bipartite pure entangled states , obtained from with and without collective measurements . also included below is the upper bound of @xmath64 obtained from the ub algorithm .",
    "the first column of the table gives the number of copies @xmath45 involved in the measurements .",
    "each quantum state is labeled by their non - zero schmidt coefficients , which are separated by : in the subscripts attached to the ket vectors ; e.g.  @xmath65 is the state with unnormalized schmidt coefficients @xmath66 . for each quantum state",
    "there is a box around the entry corresponding to the smallest @xmath45 such that the lower bound of @xmath64 on the maximal violation exceeds the single - copy upper bound coming from the ub algorithm . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     similarly , if we consider @xmath45 copies of pure two - qutrit entangled states written in the schmidt form , @xmath67 where @xmath51 , @xmath68 , it can be verified that their bell - ch inequality violation , as given by , also increases steadily with the number of copies .",
    "thus , if gives the maximal bell - ch violation for pure two - qutrit states , better bell inequality violation can also be attained by collective measurements using two copies of these quantum states .",
    "the explicit value of the violation can be found in column 3 and 4 of table  [ tbl : maximalviolation ] for two specific two - qutrit states .",
    "as above , even if the maximal bell - ch violation is not given by , collective measurements with can definitely give a violation that is better than the maximal - single - copy ones as a result of the bound coming from the ub algorithm for a single copy ( see table  [ tbl : maximalviolation ] ) .",
    "corresponding examples for pure bipartite four - dimensional and five - dimensional quantum states can also be found in the table .",
    "some intuition for the way in which better bell - ch inequality violation may be obtained with collective measurements and the measurement scheme is that the reordering of subspaces prior to the measurements generally increases the total probability of finding 2-dimensional subspaces with @xmath69 , while ensuring that the remaining 2-dimensional subspaces are at least as correlated as any of the corresponding single - copy 2-dimensional subspaces .",
    "the measurement then effectively projects onto each of these subspaces ( with alice and bob being guaranteed to obtain the same result ) and then performs the optimal measurement on the resulting shared two - qubit state .",
    "since the optimal measurements in each of these perfectly correlated 2-dimensional subspaces give the maximal bell - ch inequality violation , while the same measurements in the remaining 2-dimensional subspaces give as much violation as the single - copy violation , the multiple - copy violation is thus generally greater than that of a single copy .",
    "as one may have noticed , our measurement protocol bears some resemblance with the entanglement concentration protocol developed by bennett et  al .",
    "@xcite . in entanglement concentration alice and",
    "bob make slightly different projections onto subspaces that are spanned by all those ket vectors sharing the same schmidt coefficients thus obtaining a maximally entangled state in a bipartite system of some dimension .",
    "one can also obtain improved bell inequality violations by adopting their protocol and first projecting alice s hilbert space into one of the perfectly correlated subspaces and performing the best known measurements for a bell inequality violation in each of these ( not necessary 2-dimensional ) subspaces .",
    "we have compared the bell - ch inequality violation of an arbitrary pure two - qubit state derived from each of these protocols and found that the violation obtained using our protocol always outperforms the other .",
    "the difference , nevertheless , diminishes as @xmath70 .",
    "this observation provides another consistency check of the optimality of  .",
    "the impressive enhancement in a pure state bell - ch inequality violation naturally leads us to ask if the same conclusion can be drawn for mixed entangled states .",
    "the possibility of obtaining better bell inequality violation with collective measurements , however , does not seem to generalize to all entangled states .",
    "our first counterexample comes from the 2-dimensional werner state  @xcite , which can seen as a mixture of singlet state and the maximally mixed state , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the probability of finding a singlet state in this mixture .",
    "this state is entangled for @xmath73 and violates the bell - ch inequality if and only if  @xcite @xmath74 . using the lb algorithm  @xcite ,",
    "we have searched for the maximal violation of @xmath75 with @xmath76 for @xmath77 copies but no increase in the maximal violation of bell - ch inequality has ever been observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : werner ] ) .",
    "in fact , by using the ub algorithm  @xcite , we find that for two copies of some bell - ch violating werner states , their maximal bell - ch inequality violation are identical to the corresponding single - copy violation within numerical precision of @xmath78 .",
    "this strongly suggests that for some werner states the maximal bell - ch inequality violation does not depend on the number of copies @xmath45 .    ' '' ''",

    "in contrast to the pure state scenario , the set of mixed two - qubit states seems to be dominated by those whose 3-copy bell - ch inequality violation is not enhanced .",
    "in fact , among 50,000 randomly generated bell - ch violating two - qubit states  @xcite , only about @xmath81 of them were found to have their 3-copy bell - ch inequality violation greater than their maximal single - copy violation . moreover , as can be seen in fig .",

    "note that as a result of the chosen distribution over mixed states  @xcite this region is not well sampled .",
    "the region bounded by the solid line and the horizontal dashed line ( with concurrence equal to @xmath82 ) only contain two - qubit states that _ violate _ the bell - ch inequality  @xcite ; the region bounded by the solid line and the vertical dashed line ( with normalized linear entropy equal to @xmath83 ) only contain states that _ do not violate _ the bell - ch inequality  @xcite .",
    "two - qubit states found to give better 3-copy bell - ch violation are marked with red crosses.,width=370,height=287 ]    as with the pure state scenario , an enhancement of nonlocal correlations in the bell - ch setting seems to be more prevalent in higher dimensional quantum systems . in particular , for all of the 3-dimensional isotropic states  @xcite @xmath84 that were found to violate the bell - ch inequality , numerical results obtained from the lb algorithm suggest that the maximal violation increases steadily with the number of copies .",
    "further results obtained using the ub algorithm show that with @xmath80 , some of the bell - ch violating @xmath85 definitely give better bell - ch violation with collective measurements .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",

    "also included is the upper bound on the maximal @xmath86 obtained from the ub algorithm  @xcite.,width=370,height=287 ]    yet another question that one can ask is how much does the enhancement of nonlocal correlations depend on the choice of bell inequality . to address this question ,",
    "we have also studied the enhancement of nonlocal correlations with respect to other bell inequalities for probabilities , in particular the bell-3322 inequality , the bell-2233 inequality and the bell-2244 inequality  @xcite . for these bell inequalities , we find that the possibility of enhancing nonlocal correlations does seem to depend on both the number of alternative settings and the number of possible outcomes involved in a bell experiment .",
    "the dependence on the number of outcomes is particularly prominent in the case of werner states , where a large range of bell-2244-inequality - violating werner states seem to achieve a higher two - copy violation , even though their maximal bell - ch inequality violation apparently remains unchanged up to @xmath87 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : werner ] ) .    the dependence on the number of alternative settings can be seen in the best known violation of @xmath85 with respect to the bell - ch inequality and the bell-3322 inequality ( fig .",
    "[ fig : meqt ] ) .",
    "in particular , when the number of alternative settings is increased from 2 ( in the case of bell - ch inequality ) to 3 ( in the case of bell-3322 inequality ) , the range of states whereby collective measurements were found to improve the bell inequality violation is drastically",
    "_ reduced_. +",
    "in this paper , we have focused on bipartite entangled systems and considered the enhancement of nonlocal correlations by collective measurements without postselection .",
    "this amounts to allowing an experiment in which a local unitary is applied to a number of copies of the state @xmath1 prior to the bell inequality experiment .",
    "we find that the bell - ch inequality violation of all bipartite pure entangled states , can be enhanced by allowing collective measurements even without postselection . for mixed entangled states , however ,",
    "explicit examples ( werner states ) have been presented to demonstrate that there may be entangled states whose nonlocal correlations can not be enhanced in any bell - ch experiments .",
    "in fact , the set of mixed two - qubit states whose bell - ch violation can be increased with collective measurements seems to be relatively small .",
    "we have also done some preliminary studies on how the usefulness of collective measurements depends on the choice of bell inequality and on the dimension of the subsystem .",
    "our data at the moment are consistent with the hypothesis that the usefulness of collective measurements in bell inequality experiments increases with the hilbert space dimension and with the number of measurement outcomes allowed by bell inequality . on the other hand",
    "as the number of measurement settings allowed by the bell inequality increases the advantage provided by collective measurements seems to diminish .",
    "however , note that we have not really performed the systematic study required to establish such trends , if they exist , due to the great numerical effort that would be required . given these observations ,",
    "it does seem that postselection is a lot more powerful than collective measurements on their own in increasing bell inequality violation .",
    "an immediate question that follows from the present work is what is the class of quantum states whereby collective measurements can increase their bell inequality violation ?",
    "one motivation for studying our problem is to understand better the set of quantum states that violate a bell inequality and are thus inconsistent with local realism .",
    "it has been known for a long time that this set is a strict subset of the entangled states if projective  @xcite or even generalized measurements  @xcite on single copies of a system are permitted .",
    "one might wonder whether collective measurements without postselection allow us to violate bell inequalities for a larger set of states .",
    "however we do not know of examples where a state that does not violate a given bell inequality becomes violating under collective measurements when no postselection is allowed .",
    "moreover , for mixed states , the set of states whose violations increase when collective measurements are allowed appears to be rather restricted .",
    "this is consistent with the recent work by masanes  @xcite which suggests that the set of states that violates a given bell inequality under collective measurements without postselection is a subset of all distillable states .",
