    "active systems , those whose particles exhibit externally driven or self - propelled motion , challenge standard descriptions of matter . while a growing amount of evidence from both simulations and experiments suggests that the dynamical structural transitions observed in active systems bear more than just a superficial resemblance to the thermodynamic phase transitions of systems at equilibrium,@xcite the microscopically irreversible dynamics that drive these transitions can lead to a state space comprised of many similar steady - state configurations that are dynamically estranged from one another .",
    "this sort of configurational landscape is also observed in glasses , though there it is achieved through a different mechanism : kinetic trapping on a corrugated free energy surface .    in this paper",
    "we study a mixture of active and glassy particles to probe what transpires when these disparate mechanisms compete and interact .",
    "1 illustrates how such a mixture differs from a glassy system in which all the particles are active . in a fully active system",
    ", every particle will have its average energy increased by the external driving , making it possible , in many cases , to map the active system onto its passive counterpart through an effective temperature ( fig .",
    "1(*a*)).@xcite this suggests that so long as the driving is not too excessive , the same thermodynamic phases will be observed , only at lower temperatures ( or higher densities ) , a conclusion that has been borne out in a number of studies.@xcite    when only a fraction of the system is active , however , the uneven distribution of energy will stabilize some configurations of the system while destabilizing others ( fig .",

    "this has the potential to radically alter the system s phase diagram and lead to new physical phenomena .",
    "consistent with this expectation , fully active systems in which a fraction of the particles have a higher motility have been observed to exhibit novel patterns of phase separation.@xcite    the glass forming system we study in this paper is a generalization of the mean field ising spin glass , also known as the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model . in the appropriate limits ,",
    "fractional activation can be approximated as fractional annealing , and we show how this annealing modifies quantities like the free energy and the magnetization . after examining how these modifications alter the familiar sk phase diagram , we demonstrate that while some phase boundaries on the diagram merely shift or elongate , others change more drastically and allow transition pathways between phases that were not possible in the fully quenched model .",
    "most notable among these is a reentrant spin glass transition@xcite in which the spin glass can be cooled into a ferromagnet and then back to a spin glass as the temperature is lowered at fixed ferromagnetic bias .",
    "this behavior is similar in character to what has been observed in some colloid and micellar systems@xcite as well as numerous simulated systems.@xcite a perturbation theory argument reveals the physical origin of this phenomenon , and we show , to leading order , that the effect of the fractional activation on the free energy landscape is consistent with the physical picture in fig .",

    "will be stochastic , so , for a sufficiently large system , one can approximately select the coupling constants for these interactions from the distribution in equation . for a given sample ,",
    "the @xmath8 do not change and thus are considered `` quenched '' interactions , but when the free energy of the whole system is computed , it must be averaged over all realizations of the coupling constants .",
    "we generalize this model to allow for a fixed fraction , @xmath10 , of the spins to become active .",
    "we imagine there is an external driving force coupled to these spins , as well as a frictive force that keeps the system in a steady state . in the limit of strong activation",
    ", the exchange couplings of the active spins will fluctuate on time scales that are short compared to the spin relaxation time of the quenched degrees of freedom , so the steady state of this fractionally active system may be approximated by the thermal equilibrium of a fractionally annealed system .",
    "we term the resulting model the `` fractionally annealed sherrington - kirkpatrick '' ( fask ) model . a pictorial representation of this model is shown in fig .",

    "the fact that @xmath84 is proportional to @xmath10 in the first term on the right hand side of equation also explains why increasing the active fraction broadens the range of @xmath44 over which reentrance occurs .",
    "if the system is fully annealed , we can recast the hamiltonian using the weiss form of mean field theory.@xcite @xmath85 in the above , we have neglected the term that comes from integrating over the annealed degrees of freedom , since at fixed @xmath38 and @xmath10 it is just a constant .",

    "in the mean field ising spin glass , activating a fraction of the system gives rise to new physical phenomena ",
    "most notably a reentrant transition from the spin glass phase to the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the origin of this reentrant behavior lies in the fact that the active component will start to magnetize at low temperatures , generating a local magnetic field that can , for a certain range of @xmath44 , overpower the frustrated interactions of the passive spins and induce a net magnetization in the entire system .",
    "one can imagine reentrance occurring in other systems through a parallel mechanism . in a fractionally activated glass forming liquid , for example",
    ", the active particles would be harder to vitrify than the passive particles , leading to a glass phase with pockets of active particles in a liquid - like state .",
    "it is conceivable that for a limited range of densities , these pockets could transfer enough of their driven energy to the surrounding passive particles to break them out of their cages and cause reentrance to the liquid phase .",
    "this effect will be enhanced if an aligning mechanism is present , in which case the active particles will tend to exhibit cooperative motion .    while it is easy enough in theoretical treatments to leave the task of selectively activating a fraction of the system to some maxwellian mephisto , designing a practical experimental method for accomplishing this task is more difficult .",
    "recent experimental work has shown that silica particles , a well - known colloidal glass former,@xcite half coated in platinum undergo self - propelled motion in hydrogen peroxide.@xcite a dense colloidal suspension of silica particles in which only a fraction were so coated might therefore be viable as a fractionally active glass forming system ( see fig .",

    "simple spin glass models have led to many insights into the nature of the glassy state , and these concepts and tools have had applications in fields as distinct as protein folding and neurosicence . in the nascent field of active glass formers ,",
