    "the field of two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals has been undergoing a rapid development since the famous isolation of graphene  @xcite . over the years",
    ", new materials have been added to the catalogue of 2d systems , such as boron nitride , silicene , and a variety of transition metal dichalcogenides .",
    "the most recent addition to this growing family is black phosphorus .",
    "this material is composed of individual phosphorene layers , held together by the van der waals force .",
    "the weak interlayer force makes it possible to separate the bulk into few - layer structures  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a recent study has been published demonstrating a technique of obtaining monolayer phosphorene  @xcite .    despite being a fairly recent addition to the 2d library",
    ", phosphorene exhibits a number of features that set it apart from other members and make it attractive for the physics community .",
    "first , with the exception of graphene , phosphorene is the only 2d system composed of a single type of atoms . unlike graphene",
    ", however , phosphorene has a gap which is sensitive to the mechanical deformation of the lattice and the number of layers  @xcite .",
    "another trait that distinguishes phosphorene is its high anisotropy , leading to a highly asymmetric band structure .",
    "the existence of the tunable gap makes phosphorene an interesting material in the context of excitons .",
    "however , the complex electronic structure makes the study rather difficult .",
    "work has been done on determining the binding energies of excitons in black phosphorus using first - principles calculations  @xcite and variational methods  @xcite .",
    "however , there have been no systematic studies of the excitonic behavior and its dependence on the variable system parameters such as the band structure and the strength of interaction . in this paper",
    ", we address this problem using numerical methods .",
    "we begin by deriving a general expression for the potential inside a polarizable 2d system in the presence of a bulk dielectric . following this",
    ", we adopt several simplifications to reduce the computation time .",
    "finally , we obtain the dependence of the excitonic energy levels on the system anisotropy and the interaction strength .",
    "the results obtained here are applicable for both direct- and indirect - gap systems as it is the curvature of the bands which is important for determining the binding energies .",
    "the consequence of the indirect gap is a longer excitonic lifetime due to the momentum mismatch between the conduction and valence band extrema .",
    "therefore , our analysis applies broadly to a variety of gapped 2d systems and make it attractive for basic science and applications .",
    "it is known that the coulomb interaction in thin dielectric sheets has a nontrivial form due to screening  @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , the keldysh interaction  @xcite applies to thin layers of finite thickness .",
    "since the concept of thickness is ill - defined for single layers , one should be careful when using this particular result .",
    "earlier work  @xcite has obtained the modified coulomb interaction for a 2d sheet in vacuum .",
    "incidentally , it has the same functional form as the keldysh interaction , but the system parameters have different origins . here",
    ", we extend the earlier result by adding a bulk dielectric positioned at distance @xmath0 below the 2d sheet to function as a substrate .",
    "keeping @xmath0 finite allows one to study suspended samples .",
    "our system consists of a dielectric slab with susceptibility @xmath1 located at @xmath2 and a two - dimensional layer situated at @xmath3 .",
    "we position a charge @xmath4 at @xmath5 and calculate the potential it creates within the layer . from the poisson s equation , we have @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the planar coordinate , @xmath8 is the charge density in the 2d layer , @xmath9 is the bound surface charge on the bulk dielectric , and @xmath10 is the total potential .",
    "it is convenient to take the fourier transform of this expression : @xmath11\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : fourier_eqn}\\ ] ] we use a hat to denote the 3d transform and a tilde for the 2d planar transform .",
    "@xmath12 labels the in - plane momentum and @xmath13 is the momentun in @xmath14-direction . using the fact that @xmath15",
    ", we write @xmath16\\ast\\frac{h}{\\left(r^2+h^2\\right)^\\frac{3}{2}}\\ , , \\label{eqn : sigma_b}\\ ] ] where asterisk represents the convolution operation .",
    "note that @xmath17 includes the contribution from the point charge , the induced charge in the thin sheet , and the surface charge of the bulk dielectric .",
    "planar fourier transform of @xmath9 is obtained from the convolution theorem : @xmath18e^{-h p}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : sigma_b_f}\\ ] ] next , we determine @xmath19 .",
    "the charge on the 2d sheet arises as a response to the in - plane field .",
    "the polarization is given by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , yielding @xmath22 where the subscripts on @xmath10 label the partial derivatives .",
    "we also set @xmath23 .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath24 plugging eqs .   and into eq .",
    ", one obtains @xmath25 where we have used @xmath26.to make the expression in eq .",
    "more amenable to our calculations , we make several simplifications .",
    "first , we position the 2d sheet on top of the dielectric , setting @xmath27 .",
    "next , we set @xmath28 and @xmath29 . taking the inverse fourier transform of the simplified eq .",
    "gives @xmath30\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : phi_2d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are struve and bessel functions , respectively .",
    "we have introduced the length scale @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "this simplified result reduces to the one obtained in ref .   for @xmath35 .",
    "while it might appear that our @xmath36 is rather crude , it is possible to replace both by their average provided they do nt differ substantially .",
    "this will be addressed in the context of phosphorene in a latter section .",
    "we now move on to the two - body problem with direction - dependent masses .",
    "the center - of - mass hamiltonian for an anisotropic two - body system with an attractive central potential is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the separation between the particles , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the masses of electrons and holes , and @xmath41 is the direction specific reduced mass . it is more convenient to address this problem by going from anisotropic masses to an anisotropic potential by performing a change of variables @xmath42 this results in @xmath43 with @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "a problematic trait of our central potential is its singularity .",
    "in addition , the wavefunctions change much more at small @xmath7 , so we need to emphasize them in the solution .",
    "thus , we perform a change of variables @xmath46 : @xmath47 = \\frac{\\text{ha}}{gw}\\mathcal{h}\\ , , \\label{eqn : h_change_var } \\\\ u(y)&=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\left[h_0\\left(y\\right)-y_0\\left(y\\right)\\right]\\,,\\quad   g = \\frac{4}{\\kappa^2}\\bar\\mu w\\ , , \\label{eqn : potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is @xmath49 divided by the bohr radius and ha is the hartree energy .",
    "the benefit of this transformation turns out to be not only the removal of the singularity , but also of the first derivative , bringing the equation to the appropriate form to be solved by the numerov method .",
    "having set up the problem , we proceed to the numeric solution . from eq .  , we are tying to solve the reduced hamiltonian problem @xmath50 where @xmath51 are the basis functions and @xmath52 are their respective coefficients .",
    "as expected for a central potential , the general form of a basis function is @xmath53 plugging it into eq .",
    ", we write    @xmath54\\left[g_l(t)\\cos",
    "l\\phi+ h_l(t)\\sin l\\phi\\right ] = \\mathcal{e}\\sum_{l=0}^\\infty\\left[g_l(t)\\cos l\\phi+ h_l(t)\\sin l\\phi\\right]\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : big_sch}\\ ] ]    because of the @xmath55 term in the potential , it only couples sines to sines and cosines to cosines .",
    "moreover , it is clear that not only do sines and cosines couple exclusively among themselves , but also that even and odd angular momentum coefficients to not mix .",
    "thus , because of the harmonic mixing introduced by the anisotropy , eigenstates now fall into one of four classes : @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 label the harmonic function and the superscript designates whether the angular momenta are even or odd . for the isotropic case , @xmath60 includes @xmath61 and @xmath62 orbitals , @xmath63 contains @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 has @xmath67 , and @xmath68 represents @xmath69 and @xmath70 . once the anisotropy is turned on , the orbitals in each class mix , but for small @xmath71 they retain most of their original shape .",
    "therefore , for the sake of convenience , we will refer to the anisotropic wavefunctions using the isotropic orbital names .",
    "an important consequence of the harmonic mixing has to do with the selection rules for the electric dipole transition between the energy levels .",
    "the standard electric dipole perturbation is given by @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the field polarization vector . to determine whether a transition is allowed , the matrix element of @xmath74 for the initial and the final states is computed .",
    "from the structure of @xmath74 , it is known that the particle can move only between energy levels whose angular momenta differ by one . with the introduction of the four anisotropic classes where each state contains multiple angular harmonics this requirement changes .",
    "now the transitions are allowed between classes which contain harmonics that differ by one . in other words , the transitions between even and odd classes are now allowed and those withing even and odd groups are prohibited .",
    "of course , the rate of the transition depends on the contribution of the  correct \" harmonics to the given states .",
    "nonetheless , for large enough @xmath71 s this mechanism can result in a higher rate than , say , electric quadrupole transitions .",
    "following the discussion above , we set @xmath75 where @xmath76 runs over the appropriate harmonic numbers and @xmath77 is cosine or sine , respectively , we multiply eq .   by @xmath78 and",
    "integrate to get @xmath79    we define a vector function @xmath80 $ ] where each entry corresponds to a particular angular harmonic .",
    "naturally , one has to terminate the sum at some harmonic number @xmath81 , resulting in @xmath82 terms in the vector function .",
    "note that @xmath83 can be 0 , 1 , or 2 .",
    "@xmath84 corresponds to even-@xmath85 cosine - like wavefunctions ; @xmath86 is used for odd cosine- and sine - like functions ; @xmath87 applies to even sine - like functions since @xmath84 results in vanishing sine terms .",
    "we also introduce an angular momentum operator @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a diagonal matrix of @xmath85 , and the interaction operator @xmath90 which couples the harmonics in accordance with eq .  .",
    "putting everything together allows us to write @xmath91 the form of eq .",
    "is precisely what is required for the matrix numerov method .",
    "the numerov method entails dividing the range of @xmath92 into @xmath93 steps of size @xmath94 and using the following set of relations to connect @xmath95 ( where the subscript labels the @xmath92-position ) to two preceding steps : @xmath96\\ , , \\label{eqn : rl_move}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to use this method , one chooses the initial conditions at @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . then , one designates a matching point @xmath101 , located between @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and uses eq .   to approach this matching point from the right and the left . as we are using @xmath82 harmonics in the expansion of the basis functions",
    ", we need to have @xmath82 basis functions .",
    "these are obtained by setting up different initial conditions at the boundaries so that all basis @xmath104 s are linearly independent at the edges .",
    "one needs to be aware of a numerical problem that may arise .",
    "as the integration goes forward , the component of the vector @xmath104 corresponding to the largest harmonic grows exponentially faster than others because of the @xmath105 term in @xmath106 .",
    "this causes the basis vector functions to lose their linear independence by the time @xmath101 is reached .",
    "this can be remedied by using the riley regularization procedure  @xcite . defining @xmath107 as a matrix containing all the vectors @xmath108 , where @xmath109 labels the basis vector , we transform all the already - computed @xmath110 s by multiplying them by @xmath111 .",
    "one needs to perform this procedure regularly to prevent the exponentially growing vector componen from destroying the linear independence of the basis vectors .",
    "in fact , if one is only interested in the energies and not the actual wavefunction , it is possible to apply the regularization procedure only to @xmath107 and the previous @xmath110 as only two points are used in the numerov integration .",
    "this can substantially reduce the computation time .    finally , since all harmonics have to be matched at @xmath101 independently , we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 denote left- and right- moving solutions , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the coefficients of the solutions originating from different initial conditions .",
    "this can be rewritten as @xmath117 by varying the energy parameter @xmath118 , one solves the determinant equation using the bisection method .",
    "one downside of the potential in eq .   is its complexity as it makes the integral in eq .",
    "rather slow . to speed up the evaluation",
    ", we use an approximate form for the potential  @xcite : @xmath119\\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : simp_u}\\ ] ] to demonstrate the quality of this simplification , we begin by computing the ground state energies for the isotropic case as a function of @xmath120 using the original @xmath121 and the simplified @xmath122 .",
    "we use the @xmath123 case as it requires no harmonic integration and the @xmath124 state can be obtained directly by using a single @xmath125 harmonic .",
    "we present the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : interaction_comparison ] . as one can see , the agreement is quite good between the two potentials .",
    "even with the simplified potential , the solution to the problem is still computationally intensive .",
    "there are , nevertheless , certain steps that one can take to reduce the time needed to obtain the results .",
    "it is clear that the bound - state energies depend on the interaction strength @xmath120 and the anisotropic parameter @xmath71 .",
    "however , the coupling matrix @xmath90 depends only on @xmath71 .",
    "this means that one can fix @xmath71 and calculate @xmath90 once for a particular set of angular harmonics and @xmath92-grid and then reuse it to obtain energies for different @xmath120 s .",
    "this process can then be repeated for other @xmath71 s and sets of harmonics . as the computation of @xmath90 requires a large number of numerical integrals , doing it only once significantly cuts the computation time .",
    "we are now in the position to perform the necessary calculations .",
    "the results for the first two levels of the @xmath61-like orbital are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_orbitals ] .",
    "we plot the energies @xmath118 for a range of @xmath71 s to show its dependence on the interaction strength @xmath120 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that , while superlinear , @xmath118 changes slower than @xmath126 as it does for the regular coulomb interaction",
    ". one can also see that the @xmath118 changes more rapidly with @xmath120 for the second energy eigenstate .",
    "this means that the relative energy level separation varies with @xmath120 and can not be determined from the quantum numbers .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the energy states with higher @xmath71 change with @xmath120 more than the more isotropic ones .",
    "this makes the anisotropic states much more sensitive to the dielectric constant of the bulk dielectric .",
    "comparing the @xmath124 and @xmath127 states reveals that anisotropy plays a much greater role for the @xmath127 orbital .",
    "this can be seen by looking at the probability distributions at @xmath128 . while for @xmath124 such a high anisotropy results in a fairly mild deformation from the circularly symmetric case , @xmath127 manifests a qualitatively different behavior .",
    "the particle cloud outside the orbital node becomes  folded \" into two lobes along the @xmath129-axis . analyzing",
    "the orbital composition shows that the anisotropic @xmath127 case gets its appearance from the combination of the isotropic @xmath127 and the @xmath62 components . the apparent difference between @xmath124 and @xmath127 , therefore ,",
    "can be understood in terms of the perturbation theory , regarding the anisotropic portion of the potential as the perturbation . as @xmath124 is the deepest energy state ,",
    "it is significantly separated from other states with the correct parity in terms of energy .",
    "this means that even at larger @xmath71 , @xmath124 does not pick up a substantial amount of higher - level traits .",
    "in contrast , @xmath127 is shallower and is located closer to higher - harmonic states , resulting in a greater modification of the wave function .     +    next , we move to the @xmath130 orbitals , fig .",
    "[ fig : p_orbitals ] . here , a stark difference is observed between the @xmath64 and @xmath69 orbitals .",
    "@xmath69 demonstrates an expected behavior with @xmath118 becoming more negative at larger @xmath71 and @xmath120 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath64 not only does not depend very strongly on @xmath71 , but it also exhibits a non - monotonic variation with the anisotropic parameter .",
    "this non - monotonicity has previously been observed in ref .  .",
    "to understand this behavior , we need to look at the probability distribution for both orbitals . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the lobes are located along the @xmath129-axis , which is the direction along which the potential well diverges as @xmath131 .",
    "this means that as @xmath71 gets larger , more of the particle cloud experiences the enhanced potential , making @xmath118 more negative . in the case of @xmath64 ,",
    "the lobes are perpendicular to the diverging direction and the wave function actually vanishes along the @xmath129-axis .",
    "thus , a small anisotropy does not lower the energy of the @xmath132 orbital , but instead raises it by coupling it to higher energy states .",
    "as @xmath71 approaches 1 , the potential well gets deeper around the @xmath129 axis , lowering the energy of the state somewhat . however , since the wave function is still zero along the diverging axis , the energy remains finite .",
    "+    an important feature of this modified potential is the lifting of the accidental degeneracy .",
    "unlike the standard coulomb problem , @xmath127 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 all have different energies at finite @xmath71 . of course",
    ", @xmath64 and @xmath69 energies coincide at @xmath134 , but they are still different from the @xmath61 orbital . thus , the energy level picture becomes much richer as the eigenstates of the hamiltonian separate in the energy space .",
    "finally , we address the important case of phosphorene . this phosphorus allotrope is known for its highly anisotropic crystal structure . from the first principles calculations ,",
    "we obtain the effective electron and hole masses in @xmath135 and @xmath129 directions . the band map for the conduction and valence bands",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] , along with the crystal lattice .",
    "+    for the electrons , we get @xmath136 and @xmath137 . for the holes , @xmath138 and",
    "@xmath139 is a very large number as the band is essentially flat .",
    "this yields @xmath140 and @xmath141 . using these reduced masses ,",
    "we obtain @xmath142 and @xmath143 . to obtain the characteristic length @xmath144",
    ", we need the susceptibility of the material .",
    "the 2d susceptibility is obtained using density - functional theory , following the method proposed in ref .  , which is based on the calculation of the dielectric permittivity @xmath145 as a function of the interlayer distance ( @xmath146 ) , @xmath147    the symmetry of the bulk black phosphorus unit cell was preserved as the inter - layer distance",
    "was increased up to three times the lattice parameter along the @xmath135 direction .",
    "the @xmath135 and @xmath129 components of the dielectric constant were obtained using the quantum espresso code.@xcite the exchange correlation energy was described by the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using the pbe functional.@xcite the kohn - sham orbitals were expanded in a plane - wave basis with a cutoff energy of 70  ry .",
    "the kohn - sham states corresponding to the valence and conduction bands are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] . for the dielectric tensor calculation ,",
    "a rigid \" scissors operator  shift of 0.72 ev was applied to the kohn - sham eigenvalues .",
    "this corrects for the difference between the nearly vanishing pbe bandgap of bulk black phosphorus ( 80  mev ) and the value obtained by previous gw calculations.@xcite the brillouin - zone ( bz ) was sampled using a monkhorst - pack grid of 15@xmath14840@xmath14840 points along each of the primitive lattice vectors.@xcite in this way , we obtain a linear dependence of @xmath149 on the inverse inter - layer distance , with @xmath150   and @xmath151   , fig .  [ fig : chi_fit ] .",
    "since the values are fairly close , we use the average and set @xmath152  .",
    "this yields @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "it is now possible for us to determine the excitonic binding energy in phosphorene . since the dependence of the interaction strength @xmath120 on the dielectric constant of the substrate is rather simple",
    ", we can obtain the binding energy as a function of @xmath155 .",
    "to do so , we compute the lowest excitonic energy for @xmath156 for a range of @xmath155 s between 1 and 5 , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : e_kappa ] .",
    "for the case of isolated phosphorene , given by @xmath157 , the binding energy is @xmath158 ev .",
    "this value is close to the one obtained from the first principles calculations in an earlier work  @xcite .",
    "there , the authors reported the binding energy to be @xmath159 ev . with increasing @xmath155 ,",
    "the lowest bound state becomes more shallow due to screening . in the case of phosphorene positioned on @xmath160 ,",
    "the exciton binding energy is close to @xmath161 ev , similar to the value reported in ref .  .",
    "we can also compute the wavefunctions of phosphorene excitons , see fig .",
    "[ fig : bp_orbitals ] . at the first glance",
    ", it might appear strange that the wavefunctions are stretched in @xmath135 direction , in contradiction to the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : s_orbitals][fig : p_orbitals ] .",
    "however , one needs to keep in mind the change of variables in eq .  .",
    "when we go back to the original real - space variables , the orbitals become stretched in the @xmath135 direction since the @xmath135 mass is much smaller than the @xmath129 mass . from fig .",
    "[ fig : bp_orbitals ] , we can see that the excitons are fairly large , spanning tens of angstroms .",
    "this provides additional validation to our approach of using the continuum approximation in eq .",
    "using a combination of the first principles calculations , numerov method , and analytics , we study the general excitonic behavior of anisotropic 2d systems . we employ a modified electron - hole interaction which includes screening due to the 2d system itself , as well as due to the dielectric substrate .",
    "our results show the dependence of the excitonic energies on both the interaction strength and the anisotropy parameter arising from the direction - dependent effective masses .",
    "unlike the unscreened coulomb case , the energy has a weaker , sub - quadratic dependence on the interaction strength with higher energy levels being more sensitive .    from our results",
    ", we compute the exciton binding energy for phosphorene .",
    "we see that our solution for the isolated monolayer agrees with the earlier gw calculations  @xcite and phosphorene on silicon dioxide is congruent with the value obtained using variational methods  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of our approach over the other two is the reduced requirement for the computational power compared to the gw and the applicability for higher energy levels where variational methods lose accuracy .",
