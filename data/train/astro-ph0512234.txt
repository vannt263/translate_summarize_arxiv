    "a generic prediction of high - resolution simulations of hierarchical cold dark matter ( cdm ) models is that virialized regions of halos are not smooth , but contain subhalos  the bound , self - gravitating dark matter clumps orbiting in the potential of their host halo .",
    "the subhalos are the descendants of halos accreted by a given system throughout its evolution , which retain their identity in the face of disruption processes such as tidal heating and dynamical friction .",
    "their presence is in itself a vivid manifestation of the hierarchical build - up of halo mass .    in the cdm scenario ,",
    "luminous galaxies form via cooling and condensation of baryons in the centers of the potential wells of dark matter halos @xcite . in the context of galaxy formation",
    ", there is little conceptual difference between halos and subhalos , because the latter have also been genuine halos and sites of galaxy formation in the past , before their accretion onto a larger halo .",
    "we thus expect that each subhalo of sufficiently large mass should host a luminous galaxy and this is indeed supported by self - consistent cosmological simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the observational counterparts of subhalos are then galaxies in clusters and groups or the satellites around individual galaxies . in this sense",
    ", we will use the term _ halos _ to refer to both distinct halos ( i.e. , halos not located within the virial radius of a larger system ) and subhalos .",
    "although this general picture is definitely reasonable , it is not clear just how direct the relation between halos and galaxies is .",
    "one may argue , for example , that the subhalos can be disrupted much faster than the more tightly bound stellar system they host , leaving behind `` orphan '' galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . at the same time , properties of surviving subhalos , such as maximum circular velocity and gravitationally bound mass , are subject to strong dynamical evolution as they orbit within the potential of their host halo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this makes the relation between subhalo properties and galaxy luminosity ambiguous @xcite , because the latter may be less affected by dynamical processes but may evolve due to aging of the stellar populations after ram pressure strips the existing gas and the accretion of new gas is suppressed .",
    "the key question that we address in this paper is whether there is a one - to - one correspondence between populations of halos in dissipationless cosmological simulations and galaxies in the observable universe . as a test",
    ", we use comparisons of the predicted clustering of halos with the available observational measurements of galaxy clustering from @xmath4 to the present .    during the last decade , large observational surveys of galaxies both at low and high redshifts",
    "have tremendously improved our knowledge of galaxy clustering , its evolution , and the relation between the galaxy and matter distributions .",
    "a coherent picture has emerged in which bright galaxies are strongly biased with respect to the matter distribution at high redshifts @xcite , and in which the bias decreases with time in such a way that the amplitude of galaxy clustering is only weakly evolving ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as expected in hierarchical structure formation @xcite .",
    "the bias is also in general scale- and luminosity - dependent .",
    "bright ( red ) galaxies are more strongly clustered than faint ( blue ) galaxies both in the local universe ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and in the distant past @xcite .",
    "a recent development is the detection of a departure from a pure power law in the two - point correlation function of galaxies at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this departure is expected in general because the two - point correlation function is a sum of two separate contributions : the one - halo term , which arises from pairs of galaxies within a distinct dark matter halo , and the two - halo term , which arises from pairs of galaxies from two different distinct halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the one - halo contribution dominates on small scales , while at scales larger than the size of the largest virialized regions clustering is due to the two - halo term .",
    "the two terms are not generically expected to combine so as to give a power - law correlation function .",
    "the deviation of the correlation function from a power - law was _ predicted _ to be even stronger at higher redshifts @xcite , and this has now been convincingly confirmed @xcite using galaxy samples identified with the lyman - break technique @xcite .",
    "despite impressive advances in the amount and quality of data on the galaxy distribution over a wide range of redshifts , the exact relation between dark matter halos and luminosity- or lyman - break - selected galaxies is still rather uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most popular attempts to connect the dark halos and luminous galaxies employ semi - analytic modeling ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , which uses phenomenological recipes for specifying when , where , and how galaxies form within dark matter halos , often in conjunction with high - resolution dissipationless simulations .",
    "another popular approach is to use the halo model ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which , in its simplest form , specifies the probability distribution for a particular halo of mass @xmath15 to host a given number of galaxies @xmath16 with specified properties , such as luminosity , color , etc .",
    "more complex halo models include the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) approach @xcite which specifies the luminosity function for halos of mass @xmath15 , and models which connect other features ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while these approaches manage to capture the general observational trends , they usually employ a large number of free parameters , making it difficult to glean the relevant underlying mechanism(s ) responsible for the agreement between the model and data .",
    "most implementations also do not provide a direct constraint on the relation between luminous components of galaxies and dark matter halos .",
    "in fact , _ assumptions _ are made about this relation in most cases .    in this study",
    "we use galaxy clustering to address two straightforward issues .",
    "first , we question whether current data is consistent with a one - to - one correspondence between luminous galaxies and galaxy - sized dark matter halos in cosmological simulations .",
    "second , we ask whether the observed clustering is consistent with a simple relation between galaxy luminosity and some property of its host halo . in the context of the second question ,",
    "we investigate which halo properties are most closely related to galaxy luminosity .",
    "we show with the currently available data the answer to both of these questions is yes , as we can reproduce luminosity - dependent clustering measurements at different redshifts from @xmath4 to @xmath10 with a simple , non - parametric model relating galaxy luminosity to the halo circular velocity .",
    "although a number of studies during the last decade have shown that galaxy clustering can be approximately matched by the clustering of dark matter halos in dissipationless simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) the size of observational samples did not allow thorough tests of the galaxy - halo relation .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite compare the two - point correlation function of halos and bright galaxies from the sdss and pscz surveys , respectively , and find good agreement on scales @xmath17(@xmath18  mpc@xmath19 .",
    "however , these studies do not attempt to match the clustering of fainter galaxies .",
    "@xcite assign luminosities to halos and compute the galaxy - mass correlation function , finding good agreement for two broad luminosity bins , after a reasonable amount of scatter was introduced into the relation .",
    "the current work extends these analyses by comparing results of very high - resolution simulations to the most current measurements of the two - point correlation functions over a wide range of luminosities and redshifts .",
    "the large size and wide luminosity range of observational samples allows us to test the relation between galaxy luminosities and properties of their host halos with unprecedented power .",
    "the novel feature of the simulation analysis we present is that for each halo and subhalo we track the evolution of its properties , such as mass and maximum circular velocities .",
    "as we show below , this is a key piece of information for reasons that are easy to understand . for distinct halos ,",
    "the current circular velocity is a measure of their potential well built - up during evolution , and can therefore be expected to be tightly correlated with the stellar mass ( or more generally the baryonic mass ) of the galaxy the halo hosts .",
    "the circular velocity of subhalos in dissipationless simulations , on the other hand , is a product of both mass buildup during the period when the halo evolved in isolation _ and _ tidal mass loss after the halo starts to orbit within the virialized region of a larger object and experience strong tidal forces @xcite .",
    "the stellar component of the galaxies , which should be more tightly bound than halo dark matter , should not be significantly affected by tidal forces and can stabilize the mass distribution ( and hence @xmath6 ) in the inner regions .",
    "we can therefore expect that luminosity and stellar mass of galaxies hosted by halos in dissipationless simulations should be correlated with the subhalo mass or circular velocity , @xmath7 , _ at the epoch of accretion _ , rather than with its current value .",
    "this is borne out by cosmological simulations , which include gas dynamics , cooling , and star formation @xcite who show that selection using @xmath7 results in subhalo properties similar to the selection based on stellar mass of galaxies subhalos host .",
    "one can therefore argue that a reasonable approach is to relate galaxy luminosity to the current halo circular velocity for distinct halos and to the circular velocity at accretion for subhalos .",
    "the main result of this study is that this simple model reproduces the luminosity - dependence of galaxy clustering at different epochs with remarkable , and perhaps surprising , accuracy .",
    "we note that @xcite have recently presented and used a semi - analytic model for subhalos , which employs a similar approach to luminosity assignment , except that they use the total bound halo mass instead of circular velocity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in @xmath20[s : sims ] we briefly describe the simulations , halo finding algorithm , and the method for tracking the evolution of halos .",
    "@xmath20[s : appr ] details our method for relating halos to galaxies , and elaborates upon our motivation for using @xmath7as the basis for the luminosity assignment for subhalos . in @xmath20[s",
    ": res ] we compare observational clustering results over the redshift interval @xmath21 to the clustering of halos in dissipationless @xmath0cdm simulations .",
    "the halo occupation distribution implied by this model is described in @xmath20[s : hod ] . in @xmath20[s : disc ] we discuss the implications of our results and in @xmath20[s : conc ] we summarize our main conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath0cdm cosmology with @xmath22 .",
    "the simulations used here were run using the adaptive refinement tree ( art ) @xmath16-body code @xcite .",
    "the art code implements successive refinements in both the spatial grid and temporal step in high density environments .",
    "these simulations were run in the concordance flat @xmath0cdm cosmology with @xmath23 , @xmath2 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the present - day matter and vacuum densities in units of the critical density , and @xmath26 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath27 km s@xmath28 mpc@xmath28 .",
    "the power spectra used to generate the initial conditions for the simulations were determined from a direct boltzmann code calculation ( courtesy of wayne hu ) .",
    "we use a power spectrum normalization of @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the rms fluctuation in spheres of @xmath31 mpc comoving radius .    to study the clustering properties of dark matter halos over a range of scales , we consider two simulations of the above cosmology the first simulation , l80 , followed the evolution of @xmath32 particles in a @xmath33 mpc box .",
    "the l80 simulation has a particle mass of @xmath34 @xmath35 and peak force resolution @xmath36 @xmath18 kpc .",
    "this is the simulation to which we make most comparisons with observations .",
    "the second simulation we consider is denoted l120 and was run with @xmath32 particles in a @xmath37 @xmath18 mpc box , resulting in a particle mass of @xmath38 @xmath35 and peak force resolution @xmath39 @xmath18 kpc .",
    "this simulation thus has a larger particle mass and somewhat lower spatial resolution compared to the l80 run .",
    "we use this simulation to obtain better statistics for the correlation function of rare ( i.e. , massive ) objects .",
    "our analysis requires detailed dynamical knowledge of not only distinct halos , i.e. halos with centers that do not lie within any larger virialized system , but also subhalos which are located within the virial radii of larger systems .",
    "note that the term `` halo '' ( e.g. , the _ halo _ occupation distribution ) usually refers to what we call distinct halos in this work .",
    "we identify distinct halos and the subhalos within them using a variant of the bound density maxima ( bdm ) halo finding algorithm @xcite .",
    "details of the algorithm and parameters used can be found in @xcite ; we briefly summarize the main steps here .",
    "all particles are assigned a density using the ` smooth ` algorithm which uses a symmetric sph smoothing kernel on the @xmath40 nearest neighbors . starting with the highest overdensity particle",
    ", we surround each potential center by a sphere of radius @xmath41 kpc and exclude all particles within this sphere from further search .",
    "hence no two halos can be separated by less than @xmath42 .",
    "we then construct density , circular velocity , and velocity dispersion profiles around each center , iteratively removing unbound particles as described in @xcite .",
    "once unbound particles have been removed , we measure quantities such as @xmath43 , the maximum circular velocity of the halo . for each distinct halo",
    "we calculate the virial radius , defined as the radius enclosing overdensity of 180 with respect to the _ mean _ density of the universe at the epoch of the output .",
    "we use this virial radius to classify objects into distinct halos and subhalos .",
    "the halo catalog is complete for halos with more than @xmath44 particles which corresponds , for the l80 simulations , to a minimum halo mass of @xmath45 @xmath46 .    for subhalos",
    "we also tabulate @xmath7 , the maximum circular velocity at the time when a subhalo falls into a distinct halo . in order to tabulate this quantity we rely on merger trees generated for these simulations , which track the histories of both distinct halos and subhalos",
    ". a detailed description of the merger tree construction is given in @xcite .",
    "the merger trees we use here follow halo evolution through 48 timesteps between @xmath47 and the present for the l80 box and 89 timesteps for the l120 box . for each subhalo , we use the merger trees to step back in time until the subhalo is no longer identified as belonging to a larger system .",
    "we then define @xmath7to be @xmath6of the subhalo at that time .    in the top panel of figure [",
    "f : cumn_z ] we show the cumulative velocity function for all identified halos from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "this figure quantifies the relation between @xmath7and @xmath50 , as we will use these two quantities interchangeably to define our halo samples throughout the paper .",
    "in the bottom panel we show the corresponding cumulative fraction of subhalos as a function of time .",
    "the figure shows that the subhalo fraction is a weak function of circular velocity at all epochs .",
    "there is a weak trend for a smaller subhalo fraction among halos with larger @xmath7 .",
    "there is a stronger trend of increasing subhalo fraction with decreasing redshift .",
    "in this section we motivate and describe our model for associating galaxies with dark matter halos .",
    "we make this connection by relating galaxy luminosity and a physical property of dark matter halos , for which we choose @xmath8for distinct halos and @xmath7for subhalos . as discussed above , for subhalos @xmath7denotes the maximum circular velocity _ at the time",
    "the subhalo was accreted_. the maximum of the circular velocity profile , @xmath6 , is a measure of the depth of the halo potential well and is expected to correlate strongly with stellar mass of the galaxies , as implied by the tully - fisher and faber - jackson relations . at the same time , the definition of @xmath6 in simulations is unambiguous both for distinct halos and subhalos , which is not the case for the total mass , as different operational definitions are used by different authors . it should be noted that @xmath6used here will not correspond directly to @xmath6observed in , for example , the tully - fisher relation because dissipationless simulations do not take into account the effect of baryon condensation on @xmath6(e.g .",
    "the use of @xmath7for subhalos is the novel feature of our model . as we discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the motivation for this is fairly straightforward . while @xmath6decreases due to tidal stripping as a halo falls through a larger halo @xcite",
    ", one can expect that the stellar component of galaxies within these halos will not be affected appreciably since stars are concentrated near the bottom of the halo potential well and are more tightly bound ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence we argue that , for galaxies associated with subhalos , luminosity should correlate more strongly with @xmath7 than the @xmath8 affected by dynamical evolution .",
    "therefore , throughout the rest of the paper , unless explicitly stated otherwise , the maximum circular velocity , @xmath6 , will be assumed to mean : @xmath51 v_{\\rm max}^{\\rm now } , & { \\rm distinct\\ halos } \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] although it is not clear how accurate this assumption is in detail , we show that it provides a considerably better match to observed galaxy clustering compared to the uniform selection using @xmath8 for both subhalos and distinct halos . note also that the use of circular velocities before accretion can also help explain the abundance of faint dwarf galaxies in the local group @xcite .    in order to assign luminosities , we assume a monotonic relation between galaxy luminosity and @xmath6 and require that the @xmath9@xmath6 relation preserves the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "specifically , we use the following equation : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the number density of galaxies and halos , respectively .",
    "we stress again , that @xmath6 in the above expression is equal to @xmath7 for subhalos and to @xmath8 for distinct halos ( for which the accretion epoch is undefined ) . for each @xmath55",
    "we find the corresponding @xmath56 such that the above relation is satisfied .",
    "the main assumption is therefore that there is a monotonic relation between galaxy luminosity and @xmath6 .",
    "the model makes no further assumptions and is completely non - parametric .",
    "this should be kept in mind when we compare _ predictions _ of this model to observed galaxy clustering .",
    "note that we do not take any possible scatter in the @xmath9@xmath6 relation into account in this model .    with the @xmath9@xmath6 relation in hand , comparing observational clustering statistics to the model predictions",
    "is straightforward : we simply compute the desired statistic for the halos with assigned luminosities corresponding to the observed sample luminosity range .",
    "this method does not currently treat other galaxy properties such as color , although it could conceivably be extended to include such properties .",
    "we have not included the possibility of `` orphaned galaxies '' , i.e. galaxies without any associated subhalos .",
    "we discuss the issue of orphans in detail in @xmath20[s : disc ] .",
    "figure [ f : vcomp ] shows the effect that selection of halos using @xmath7rather than @xmath8for subhalos has on the projected two - point correlation function @xmath57 for different number densities , at @xmath58 .",
    "as expected , the effect is most significant on small scales , where the subhalo contribution dominates , and the difference between @xmath7and @xmath8is greatest .    in figure",
    "[ f : xigm ] we show the effect of selecting halos according to @xmath7and @xmath8on the galaxy - mass cross - correlation function , @xmath59 .",
    "the small bump in the sample selected using @xmath7 in the top panel is due to the fact that @xmath7samples in general have more satellites than @xmath8samples , and the satellite contribution to @xmath59 peaks near @xmath60 @xmath18 mpc .",
    "the `` bump '' is smaller in the lower panel , where the @xmath6threshold is much higher , because the number of satellites is nearly the same between the @xmath7and @xmath8selected samples in this case .    at higher redshifts the differences between samples selected",
    "using @xmath7 and @xmath8 are small .. ] figure [ f : vin_ev ] shows the projected correlation function for the @xmath7- and @xmath8-selected samples at four redshifts .",
    "the samples are constructed to have a fixed number density @xmath61 mpc@xmath62 .",
    "the situation is similar for other number densities . already by @xmath63 the effect of selection",
    "is quite small .",
    "the difference on small scales for the @xmath64 and @xmath65 samples is not statistically significant .",
    "the correlation function at the smallest scales is somewhat higher for the @xmath8-selected samples , which seems counter - intuitive .",
    "we believe that this is a small artefact of the halo finding algorithm . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the halos are smaller and subhalos are typically at smaller distances from the host center . at small radii",
    "the removal of unbound particles is more difficult as the halos are located near the bottom of the potential well .",
    "the value of @xmath8 in such cases can be overestimated producing a boost in the number of subhalos above a given threshold value , and boosting the correlation function somewhat .",
    "note , however , that the effect is small and the difference between correlation functions for @xmath8- and @xmath7-selected samples is less than @xmath66 . ]",
    "we believe that this effect can be attributed to the distribution of accretion times for subhalos at each redshift : at low redshift , subhalos have a wide distribution of accretion times , and hence a large number of subhalos have had time to experience significant tidal stripping , while at higher redshifts the distribution of accretion times rises sharply near the epoch of observations .",
    "this is because both the accretion and disruption rates are high at high redshifts .",
    "the accreted halos do not survive for a prolonged period of time , so that at each high-@xmath67 epoch most of identified subhalos are recently accreted objects , which are yet to experience significant tidal mass loss .",
    "since we are only computing @xmath7for subhalos which have survived to the current epoch , one may worry that we are neglecting a significant population of subhalos with a sizeable @xmath7that are not present in the halo catalog at the current epoch .",
    "of such a population there can only be two fates : either the object was at some point physically disrupted or it has simply fallen below the resolution limit .",
    "we have used the merger trees to find all subhalos which have ever fallen into a distinct halo and have tabulated their @xmath7and the ratio in mass between the subhalo and distinct halo , at the time of accretion . for a wide range in @xmath7thresholds , the distribution of mass ratios is strongly peaked between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this implies that dynamical friction has caused the subhalo to merge with the distinct halo on the order of a dynamical time , and suggests that the majority of these subhalos have in fact physically merged and should not have survived .",
    "the absence of such missing subhalos also implies that in our simulations there should be no `` orphan '' galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see   [ s : disc ] for further discussion of this issue ) .",
    "in this section we compare clustering statistics of halos to recent observations of the galaxy two - point correlation function over the redshift interval @xmath71 .",
    "the observed clustering statistics we compare to are @xmath72 , the projected two - point correlation function , and @xmath73 , the angular two - point correlation function .",
    "we estimate @xmath74 by integrating the real space , three - dimensional correlation function , @xmath75 , computed in the simulation , along the line of sight : @xmath76 where the comoving distance @xmath77 has been decomposed into perpendicular ( @xmath78 ) and parallel to the line - of - sight ( @xmath79 ) components . in practice , the integration in eqn .",

    "dynamical friction is not efficient for the typical subhalo since now the typical subhalo is much less massive than the distinct halo , and hence a subhalo can exist within a distinct halo for a sufficient amount of time for tidal stripping to have a significant effect on @xmath6 .",
    "following the reliable identification of subhalos in @xmath16-body simulations , there has been a concerted effort to identify such subhalos with observed galaxies . a persistent problem with this approach",

    "the success of the model has several important implications .",
    "first , our results indicate that dissipationless simulations do not suffer from significant overmerging because they reproduce both the amplitude and shape of the correlation function and the underlying hod quite accurately .",
    "if our dissipationless simulations were missing a significant fraction ( @xmath275 ) of objects in groups and clusters , as suggested by some recent studies @xcite , both the amplitude and shape of the correlation function in these simulations would be grossly incorrect .",
    "we also note that recent analysis of the observed galaxy - mass cross correlation function disfavors the existence of a large population of satellites without associated dark matter halos @xcite .    in order to assess the quantitative impact of a fraction of `` orphan '' galaxies  satellite galaxies with no identifiable subhalo @xcite",
    " in our model , we perform the following test .",
    "we artificially increase the fraction of subhalos in such a way that the subhalo occupation function , @xmath276 increases in amplitude while maintaining the same shape . in order to match the observed galaxy luminosity function ,",
    "we simulatenously increase the overall @xmath6threshold for a given sample , such that the number density does not change .",
    "we find that an orphan fraction @xmath277% is inconsistent with the correlation functions of the sdss galaxy samples at @xmath5 for all luminosities ( for this cosmological model and the assumption of no scatter between @xmath278 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "our results also imply that the central assumption of the luminosity assignment model  the tight , monotonic relation between galaxy luminosity and halo circular velocity  likely exists for the observed galaxies .",
    "such a relation is indeed expected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for isolated galaxies , but our results indicate that this is true globally for galaxies of different types and for a wide range of redshifts .",
    "we argue that for subhalos the dissipation should result in a centrally condensed , tightly - bound stellar system which would stabilize the halo circular velocity against tidal heating .",
    "stellar mass and luminosity of galaxies should therefore correlate with the circular velocity of subhalos at the time they are accreted , before significant tidal evolution takes place .",
    "given that we match luminosity at a particular epoch to the circular velocity at different epochs ( the epoch of observation for distinct halos , and the epoch of accretion for subhalos ) , a subtle implication of our scheme is that the relation between luminosity and @xmath6does not evolve strongly with time  a result which may have been anticipated by the lack of scatter in the tully  fisher relationship in different environments .",
    "the corollary is then that the clustering of a particular galaxy sample is largely determined by the clustering of halos and subhalos that host the galaxies .",
    "clustering of halos and subhalos is governed by gravitational dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and discussion therein ) , while the particular subset of halos that host galaxies in a given sample is determined by the relations between observable galaxy properties and properties of their host dark matter halos _ and _ selection criteria used to define the sample . in the case of the galaxy luminosity , the relation with halo circular velocity appears to be particularly tight .",
    "the model agreement with the clustering properties of the lbg population at @xmath279 is perhaps more surprising , given that the lbg selection criteria are significantly more complicated than those of the luminosity - selected samples at @xmath280 .",
    "the success of our @xmath9@xmath6model indicates that the rest - frame lbg luminosity is likely to be tightly related to the halo circular velocity ( and hence total mass ) .",
    "this would , in turn , suggest that lbgs are fair tracers of the overall halo population rather than a special subset of halos , such as halos undergoing mergers or collisions .",
    "although we have not explicitly investigated the latter scenarios ( i.e. , mergers or collisions ) , it seems unlikely that the observed lbg clustering would be well matched by a model in which the effective duty cycle for the lbgs is small and most lbgs are associated with minor mergers or small - mass collisions .",
    "we note , however , that differences in the clustering properties and inferred host masses for the so - called `` massive halo '' model and the `` collisional starburst '' model may have been exaggerated  in the former case because the massive subhalos were ignored , and in the latter because the efficiency of star formation in mergers was probably overestimated ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a key success of the simulations and our model is the correct description of the small - scale upturn in the correlation function . at @xmath10 ,",
    "the upturn is detected for bright galaxies @xcite , while the correlation function of faint objects is very close to a power law @xcite . at @xmath281 ,",
    "the upturn is more pronounced and is now unambiguously detected both in the deep2 data and in lbg samples at @xmath282 , as predicted from the halo model arguments @xcite and cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "the trend towards more pronounced deviation from the power - law form of cf at higher @xmath67 appears to be due to a couple different factors .",
    "the accretion rate of subhalos is substantially higher at high @xmath67 , so that the abundance of subhalos with masses close to the threshold mass of the sample , @xmath283 , is also larger on average ( see   [ s : hod ] ) .",
    "this makes the `` shoulder '' of the hod of high-@xmath67 objects shorter and not as flat , increasing the number of small - separation pairs between central galaxies and satellites and between satellites themselves in _ small - mass halos_. this also makes the width of the hod at masses close to @xmath283 wider and closer to the poisson distribution .",
    "although the overall fraction of subhalos in a given sample actually _ decreases _ with increasing redshift ( see fig .  [",
    "f : cumn_z ] ) , the average mass of the distinct halos hosting most of subhalos is decreasing as well .",
    "the contribution of the pairs of objects within the same halo to the 1-halo term of the correlation function comes then predominantly from the smallest halos in the sample and the 1-halo term is considerably `` peakier '' than at lower redshifts , where halos of a wide range of masses contribute .",
    "we argue therefore that the more pronounced upturn in the correlation function at higher redshifts and for rarer objects at a given epoch is primarily due to the increased fraction of subhalos in host halos with masses closer to the threshold mass of the sample .    in the present work ,",
    "we have not included any scatter in matching luminosity and velocity relations , and it is interesting that making this approximation works so well . some scatter in the @xmath9@xmath6 relation should certainly be expected given the scatter in the observed tully - fisher and faber - jackson relations .",
    "this scatter likely depends on band , galaxy properties , and the extent to which internal dust extinction has been corrected for . for our purposes , the main effect of adding scatter in this relationship to our model would be at the highest luminosities .",
    "the insensitivity at low luminosities arises because 1 ) the luminosity function of galaxies is rather flat at @xmath284 so that the scatter results in almost equal numbers of objects scattering in and out of the sample , and 2 ) the bias of halos corresponding to these luminosity cuts ( @xmath284 ) , is only a weak function of mass and luminosity both in our simulations and in observations @xcite , so changes in the mass distribution of galaxies do not affect clustering significantly .",
    "in contrast , at higher luminosities , both the luminosity function and the bias dependence on mass are steep , and adding scatter serves to decrease the average clustering and makes the luminosity a steeper function of mass .",
    "@xcite find that some scatter is required to match the galaxy - mass correlations , but the conclusion is reached using @xmath8for subhalos , which we expect to exhibit more scatter with luminosity than @xmath7 .",
    "there is , however , an interesting tension between constraints provided by the observed galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - mass correlation functions for the most massive halos ( cf . fig .",
    "[ f : xigm ] ) : the former constrains the scatter for bright galaxies to be small , while the latter appears to require significant amount of scatter .",
    "we postpone a full discussion of these issues including combined constraints to future work .",
    "our main results and conclusions are as follows :    * we show that a simple , non - parametric model which monotonically relates galaxy luminosities to the maximum circular velocity of dark matter halos , @xmath6 , by preserving the observed galaxy luminosity function , accurately reproduces the observed luminosity - dependent clustering of galaxies over projected separations @xmath12 mpc@xmath13 , through most of the evolution of the universe from @xmath4 to the present . * the key to the success of the model is our luminosity assignment scheme , in which we use the maximum circular velocity at the time of accretion , @xmath7 , for subhalos and the maximum circular velocity at the time of observation , @xmath8 , for distinct halos .",
    "we argue that for subhalos in dissipationless simulations , @xmath7 reflects the luminosity and stellar mass of the associated galaxies better than the circular velocity at the epoch of observation , @xmath8 * our simulations , coupled with the above luminosity assignment scheme , correctly reproduce the small - scale deviation of the correlation function from the power - law form ( the upturn ) in observed luminosity - selected samples at different redshifts .",
    "the deviation is , in general , more pronounced at high redshifts .",
    "we attribute this trend to the increased fraction of satellite galaxies in host halos with masses close to the threshold mass of the sample . *",
    "our luminosity assignment model applied to the simulations at @xmath282 reproduces the observed shape and amplitude of the two - point correlation function of lyman - break galaxies on both large and small scales .",
    "this suggests that lbgs are fair tracers of the overall halo population at these epochs and that their luminosity can be simply related to the circular velocity ( and hence mass ) of their dark matter halos .",
    "although our model implies that most ( @xmath285% ) of the lbgs are central galaxies in distinct halos , a fraction of the lbgs correspond to subhalos ( i.e. , satellites ) .",
    "this fraction is sufficiently high for a significant deviation of the lbg correlation function from the power law at small scales .",
    "it is quite remarkable that , after vast improvements in observational data over the past decade , the simple picture for the formation of galaxies within virialized dark matter halos @xcite , whereby galaxy properties such as luminosity are tightly coupled to the properties of their host halos , provides a good description of the observed clustering trends of galaxies over nearly the entire age of the universe , on both large and small scales .",
    "as we discussed above , our @xmath9@xmath6 model has natural implications for the tully - fisher relation and dynamical mass - to - light ratio , and the evolution in these quantities .",
    "a fruitful followup to the study presented here would be to compare the predictions of this model to local and to ( forthcoming ) deep2 measurements of the relation .",
    "the comparison of model predictions to observed galaxy - galaxy and galaxy - mass clustering can also constrain the amount of scatter in the @xmath9@xmath6 relation for bright galaxies , and readily predicts the conditional luminosity function of galaxies ( luminosity function as a function of distinct halo mass ) , and its evolution .",
    "our luminosity assignment scheme can also be extended by separately modeling central and satellite galaxies , which appear to be two distinct populations with different origins and observable properties @xcite .",
    "the simulations were run on the columbia machine at nasa ames and on the seaborg machine at nersc ( project pi : joel primack ) .",
    "first and foremost , we would like to thank anatoly klypin for running these simulations and making them available to us .",
