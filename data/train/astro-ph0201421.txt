    "clusters of galaxies can be used to study how structures form on large scales .",
    "the formation and evolution of clusters depend very sensitively on cosmological parameters like the mean matter density @xmath2 in the universe .",
    "thus it is of great importance to determine the dynamical state of clusters at different redshifts , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "+ geometry can give important insight in the dynamics of galaxy clusters .",
    "for example , the fitting of the cluster @xmath0-ray surface brightness with @xmath1-models usually provides different best fit parameters depending on the shape one assumes for the intracluster gas , but generally the _ classical _ calculations of the mass of galaxy clusters suppose a spherical distribution of the density .",
    "+ the sz effect , @xcite , offers the possibility to put important constraints on the cosmological models .",
    "combining the temperature change in the cosmic microwave background due to the sz effect and the @xmath0-ray emission observations , the angular distance to galaxy clusters and thus the hubble constant @xmath3 can be derived .",
    "nevertheless , geometrical shape of galaxy clusters can also introduce some _ errors _ on the analysis of the sz effect .",
    "+ in section 2 we will analyze some consequences of the geometry of the clusters of galaxies and particularly on the mass , by taking as an example a recent observation of the galaxy cluster rbs797 . then we will describe , in section 3 , the influence of the cluster shape on the estimate of the sz effect . in section 4",
    "we will give an outlook on the role played by the geometry of galaxy clusters .",
    "the @xmath1-model , @xcite , is widely used in @xmath0-ray astronomy to parametrise the gas density profile in clusters of galaxies by fitting their surface brightness profile . in this fitting procedure",
    "spherical symmetry is usually assumed , also in cases where the ellipticity of the surface brightness isophotes is manifest .",
    "for example @xcite showed a pronounced ellipticity of the surface brightness for the cluster abell 2256 , @xcite obtained the same result for the profile of abell 478 and @xcite for cl0016 + 16 .",
    "+ the asphericity of the observed surface brightness let us also ponder on the possible asphericity of the intracluster medium , which can be modelled with an ellipsoidal @xmath1-model rather than with the less accurate spherical one .",
    "+ @xcite fitted the surface brightness of cl0016 + 16 , which shows an axis ratio of major to minor axis of 1.176 , with both circular and elliptical isothermal @xmath1-models obtaining for the best fit parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 arcmin and @xmath6 , @xmath7 arcmin ( @xmath8 is the core radius along the major axis ) , respectively , with the latter model providing a considerably better fit .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite with a _",
    "chandra _ observation of the galaxy cluster rbs797 revealed a pronounced aspherical geometry .",
    "the analysis of the image ( see figure 1 ) gives a strong ellipticity , where the axis ratio of major to minor axis varies slightly from 1.3 at a radius of 0.26 arcmin to 1.4 at a radius of 1.7 arcmin .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the surface brightness profile for rbs797 gives best fit parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath10 arcsec , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 arcsec ( along the major axis ) , for the circular and elliptical models respectively .",
    "+ assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and isothermal profile , the total mass of a cluster can be estimated from the parameters provided by the surface brightness fit and clearly some care is needed if the galaxy cluster in question shows a pronounced ellipsoidal shape . in this case , the general expression for the total mass density @xmath13 is given by @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant , @xmath16 the boltzman constant , @xmath17 the gas mass density , @xmath18 its temperature and @xmath19 is the mean particle mass of the gas . + in order to obtain the total mass of the cluster , one assumes a spherical geometry and integrates this equation over a sphere with radius @xmath20 . + for rbs797 we have additionally investigated the ellipsoidal geometry . for the unknown extent in the line - of - sight",
    "we assume either the visible minor or major axis ( i.e. oblate or prolate shape ) and integrated the equation over an ellipsoid ( concentric and with the same axis ratios ) with major semi - axis @xmath20 .",
    "we thus obtained mass estimates for the spherical shape : @xmath21 and @xmath22 and for ellipsoidal shapes , which are , compared at the same values of @xmath20 , lower than those for the spherical symmetry by @xmath23 and @xmath24 for oblate or prolate shapes , respectively . for a detailed analysis of the influence of the ellipsoidal shape of the intracluster medium distribution on the total mass and gas mass fraction estimations",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the sz effect is difficult to measure , since systematic errors can be important . for example , @xcite analysed the reliability of the hubble constant measurement based on the sz effect .",
    "@xcite showed that projection effects of clusters can lead incidence on the calculations of the hubble constant and the gas mass fraction , and @xcite as well as @xcite pointed out , that galaxy cluster shapes can produce systematic errors on the measured value of @xmath3 .",
    "+ we assume an ellipsoidal @xmath1-model : , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as well as the characteristic lengths of the half axes of the ellipsoid @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are defined in units of the core radius @xmath30 . ]",
    "@xmath31^{-3 \\beta /2 } ~,\\label{eq : dp}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the electron number density at the center of the cluster and @xmath1 is a free fitting parameter which lies in the range @xmath33 . + the compton parameter @xmath34 and the x - ray surface brightness @xmath35 depend on the temperature of the hot gas @xmath36 and the electron number density @xmath37 as follows @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the maximal extension of the hot gas along the line of sight in units of the core radius @xmath30 .",
    "we have chosen the line of sight along the @xmath25 axis .",
    "+ for a detailed calculation of the compton parameter and the x - ray surface brightness with an isothermal profile @xmath41 , we refer to the paper by @xcite : @xmath42 and @xmath43 , \\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath44 at the redshift @xmath45 , with @xmath46 \\nonumber\\ ] ] where we introduced the beta @xmath47 and the incomplete beta - functions @xmath48 with the cut - off parameter @xmath49 given by : @xmath50 introducing the angular core radius @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the angular diameter distance of the cluster , we can estimate the hubble constant from the ratio between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "if we choose the line of sight through the cluster center we get , see @xcite : @xmath55 ^ 2 } { { \\gamma}_{s_x}(\\beta , m)}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 for a finite extension @xmath40 and , for an infinitely extended cluster , we get instead @xmath57 ^ 2 } { { \\gamma}_{s_x}(\\beta,0)}\\ ] ] with @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath35 and @xmath59 are observed quantities , the ratios @xmath60 and @xmath61 are in the following both set equal to the measured value @xmath62 .",
    "+ @xcite determined @xmath3 from @xmath0-ray measurements of a1835 obtained with rosat and from the corresponding millimetre observations of the sz effect with the _ suzie _ experiment . assuming an infinitely extended",
    ", spherical gas distribution with an isothermal profile @xmath63 , @xmath64 kev , @xmath65 @xmath66 , they found @xmath67 km s@xmath68 mpc@xmath68 .",
    "the figures on the right show the influence of geometry and of the assumption of finite extension on the above result using the same input parameters .",
    "the left figure 2 shows that for a spherical geometry @xmath3 displays a strong dependence on the cluster extension .",
    "the right figure 2 gives the value of @xmath3 assuming an infinite extended ellipsoid shaped cluster as a function of its axis ratio @xmath69 .",
    "we find @xmath70 km mpc@xmath68 s@xmath68 for @xmath71 .",
    "+ although the isothermal distribution is often a reasonable approximation of the actual observed clusters , some clusters do show non - isothermal features .",
    "a polytropic profile has the following form : @xmath72^{\\gamma-1}.\\ ] ] the isothermal profile is obtained by setting @xmath73 .",
    "the polytropic profile can play a role in the estimates of the hubble constant .",
    "we refer to the paper of @xcite .",
    "the figure 3 shows that a small deviation from the isothermal case ( @xmath73 ) leads to a significant change in the values of the hubble constant .",
    "for instance , assuming an isothermal instead of a polytropic profile with index @xmath74 leads to an overestimation of 34 % for @xmath3 .",
    "indeed for a3562 a polytropic profile with index @xmath75 has been determined by @xcite .",
    "we see thus that the geometry of galaxy clusters can affect the estimates of the masses and can substantially change the analysis of the sz effect .",
    "the temperature profile is another important factor of change , indeed the hypothesis of isothermal profile might be too simple for some clusters .",
    "+ the recent xmm observation of the coma cluster by @xcite points out that the temperature distribution is remarkably homogeneous suggesting that the core is actually in a relaxed state , but also that the ngc 4839 group is falling into the coma cluster , see @xcite .",
    "this last result suggests the presence of more complex substructures which can be explained by a first infall onto the coma cluster .",
    "+ in some clusters there is evidence of cooling flows in the central regions .",
    "cooling flows in galaxy clusters can substantially change the temperature profiles , especially in the inner regions . @xcite and",
    "@xcite investigated the changes induced by a cooling flow in the temperature and density profiles , and their implication on the sz effect .",
    "an analogous effect might be observed if the fluid speed and density are higher , as it is expected for merging processes in clusters of galaxies .",
    "for example very recently @xcite revealed that the cl 0939 + 4713 cluster has an irregular morphology with evident substructures which seem to be in the process of merging .",
    "+ the existence of a magnetic field in the intra - cluster medium might also be important .",
    "a first analysis by @xcite suggests a possible influence on the sz effect .",
    "+ in these contexts an aspherical distribution of the density could play an additional important role . in summary",
    ", we see that it is crucial to know the shape of a cluster and its temperature profile . to address these problems ,",
    "the chandra and xmm - newton satellites have the necessary spatial resolution for a complete analysis of the geometrical parameters of galaxy clusters ."
